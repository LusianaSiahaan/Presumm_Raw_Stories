Therefore, its history is not a lengthy one. The web  started when everything was just static pages. Unless you are a six-year-old whiz kid reading this  book because you are more interested in Java web programming than PlayStation2, it is most  likely that you experienced the time when a web site was no more than HTML pages. In the  earlier days, a web site had at most one page and it more often than not was called a home page.   The terms "Internet application" or "web application" were coined when dynamic content was  introduced. Loosely interpreted, a web application is a web site whose contents are generated      xii   dynamically before being sent to the browser. You should first understand how the Internet works  before learning how a web application works.   When you surf the Internet, you basically request for a certain file located in a particular computer  in the location you specify in the Uniform Resource Locator  URL . The computer where the file  is stored is called the web server. This computer's main function is to serve anybody on the  Internet who requests files it hosts. Because you never know when a user will visit and use your  web application, your web server must be up and running all the time.   When you click or type in a URL in the Location or Address box of your browser, the following  things happen:      The client browser establishes a TCP IP connection with the server.     The browser sends a request to the server.     The server sends a response to the client.     The server closes the connection.   Note that after sending the requested page to the browser, the server always closes the connection,  whether or not the user requests other pages from the server.   What Is Happening in the Industry   Since the emergence of the Internet, web technologies have become more and more  important, and web applications are more and more common. The use of a web browser  is no longer restricted to surfing static pages on the Internet. It is now very  commonplace to see a web browser used as an application's client.   What this means is, some people believe, whoever controls the Internet controls the  future of computingâor even the future itself. At the very least, the evidence has been  demonstrated by the struggles of a few companies to grab the web browsers' domination  in the late 1990s. As the best example, Microsoft Corporationâstill the number one  player in the software business up until nowâfelt it was important to have everyone on  the planet using its Internet Explorer browser. That's why it exerted its overwhelming  power in software technology to create the fastest and smartest browser ever and  distribute it for free. With the surrender of Netscape, Microsoft has won the battle of  browsers. In the next five years, it is still hard to imagine how any browser could  surpass the popularity of Microsoft Internet Explorer.   On the server side, it's a different story, though. The war is far from over. Microsoft  can't push its server technology as easily as it forced Netscape to give up. In fact, the  most popular server technology is Java. To be precise, it's Sun Microsystems' Java 2,  Enterprise Edition  J2EE . Microsoft is still trying to catch up with its new .NET  initiative that is a replacement of its previous Distributed interNet Applications  DNA   platform for developing enterprise applications. Released in early 2002, .NET will  collide head-on with J2EE. The next few years will still see J2EE and .NET as the two  competing server technologies. Right now, it's still too premature to predict who will  come out the winner.   Strategy-wise, Microsoft takes a far different approach from Sun in trying to win.  Microsoft provides a single-vendor solution, selling from the operating system to the  database server. J2EE, on the other hand, is supported by the entire industry.  For a list  of vendors who provide J2EE compliant servers, see Appendix G, "Related Resources."   Analysts have tried to compare J2EE and .NET in many white papers published on the  Internet. Unfortunately, the conclusions vary a great deal. To find out more about how  J2EE and .NET compare, you can consult the following articles, which are available      xiii   online:              Microsoft .NET vs. J2EE: How Do They Stack Up?,   http:  java.oreilly.com news farley_0800.html   Java 2 Enterprise Edition  J2EE  versus The .NET Platform: Two Visions for  eBusiness,   http:  www.objectwatch.com FinalJ2EEand DotNet.doc   J2EE vs. Microsoft.NET: A Comparison of Building XML-Based Web  Services,   http:  www.theserverside.com resources article.jsp?l=J2EE-vs-DOTNET      Compare Microsoft .NET to J2EE Technology,   http:  msdn.microsoft.com net compare default.asp      The Great Debate: .NET vs. J2EE   http:  www.javaworld.com javaworld jw- 03-2002 jw-0308-j2eenet.html   At this point, you should have gotten the big picture of what is happening in the  industry. You can find out more about .NET at http:  msdn.microsoft.com. J2EE is  presented in the section, "Java 2."   Also note that the term web server can also be used to refer to the software package used  in the web server computer to handle requests and respond to them. In fact, throughout  this book, the term web server is used to refer to this software.   The first popular web serverâNCSA HTTPdâwas created by Rob McCool at the  National Center for Supercomputing Applications. And, McCool's invention was really  cool because it helped the Internet revolutionize our lives and went on to become the  foundation for the Apache web serverâthe most used web server on the Internet today.     The Hypertext Transfer Protocol  HTTP    HTTP is the protocol that allows web servers and browsers to exchange data over the web. It is a  request and response protocol. The client requests a file and the server responds to the request.  HTTP uses reliable TCP connectionsâby default on TCP port 80. HTTP  currently at version 1.1  at the time of this writing  was first defined in RFC 2068. It was then refined in RFC 2616, which  can be found at http:  www.w3c.org Protocols .   In HTTP, it's always the client who initiates a transaction by establishing a connection and sending  an HTTP request. The server is in no position to contact a client or make a callback connection to  the client. Either the client or the server can prematurely terminate a connection. For example,  when using a web browser you can click the Stop button on your browser to stop the download  process of a file, effectively closing the HTTP connection with the web server.      xiv   HTTP Requests   An HTTP transaction begins with a request from the client browser and ends with a response from  the server. An HTTP request consists of three components:      MethodââURIâProtocol Version     Request headers     Entity body   An example of an HTTP request is the following:   GET  servlet default.jsp HTTP 1.1   Accept: text plain; text html   Accept-Language: en-gb   Connection: Keep-Alive   Host: localhost   Referer: http:  localhost ch8 SendDetails.htm   User-Agent: Mozilla 4.0  compatible; MSIE 4.01; Windows 98    Content-Length: 33   Content-Type: application x-www-form-urlencoded   Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate     LastName=Franks&FirstName=Michael   The methodâURIâprotocol version appears as the first line of the request.   GET  servlet default.jsp HTTP 1.1   where GET is the request method,  servlet default.jsp represents the URI and HTTP 1.1  the Protocol Version section.   The request method will be explained in more details in the next section, "HTTP request  Methods."   The URI specifies an Internet resource completely. A URI is usually interpreted as being relative  to the server's root directory. Thus, it should always begin with a forward slash  . A URL is  actually a type of URI  see http:  www.ietf.org rfc rfc2396.txt . The Protocol version represents  the version of the HTTP protocol being used.   The request header contains useful information about the client environment and the entity body  of the request. For example, it could contain the language the browser is set for, the length of the  entity body, and so on. Each header is separated by a carriage return linefeed  CRLF  sequence.   Between the headers and the entity body, there is a blank line  CRLF  that is important to the  HTTP request format. The CRLF tells the HTTP server where the entity body begins. In some  Internet programming books, this CRLF is considered the fourth component of an HTTP request.   In the previous HTTP request, the entity body is simply the following line:   LastName=Franks&FirstName=Michael   The entity body could easily become much longer in a typical HTTP request.   HTTP request Methods      xv   Each HTTP request can use one of the many request methods as specified in the HTTP standards.  The HTTP 1.1 request methods and the descriptions of each method are given in Table I.1.   Table I.1. HTTP 1.1 request Methods   Description   Method  GET   HEAD   POST   PUT   GET is the simplest, and probably, most used HTTP method. GET simply retrieves the  data identified by the URL. If the URL refers to a script  CGI, servlet, and so on , it  returns the data produced by the script.  The HEAD method provides the same functionality as GET, but HEAD only returns  HTTP headers without the document body.  Like GET, POST is also widely used. Typically, POST is used in HTML forms. POST  is used to transfer a block of data to the server in the entity body of the request.   OPTIONS The OPTIONS method is used to query a server about the capabilities it provides.   Queries can be general or specific to a particular resource.  The PUT method is a complement of a GET request, and PUT stores the entity body at  the location specified by the URI. It is similar to the PUT function in FTP.   DELETE  The DELETE method is used to delete a document from the server. The document to   be deleted is indicated in the URI section of the request.   TRACE  The TRACE method is used to tract the path of a request through firewall and multiple   proxy servers. TRACE is useful for debugging complex network problems and is  similar to the traceroute tool.   Warning   HTTP 1.0 only has three request methods: GET, HEAD, and POST.   Of the seven methods, only GET and POST are commonly used in an Internet application.   HTTP Responses   Similar to requests, an HTTP response also consists of three parts:      ProtocolâStatus codeââDescription     Response headers     Entity body   The following is an example of an HTTP response:   HTTP 1.1 200 OK   Server: Microsoft-IIS 4.0   Date: Mon, 3 Jan 1998 13:13:33 GMT   Content-Type: text html   Last-Modified: Mon, 11 Jan 1998 13:23:42 GMT   Content-Length: 112              HTTP Response Example      Welcome to Brainy Software              xvi   The first line of the response header is similar to the first line of the request header. The first line  tells you that the protocol used is HTTP version 1.1, the request succeeded  200 = success , and  that everything went okay.   The response headers contain useful information similar to the headers in the request. The entity  body of the response is the HTML content of the response itself. The headers and the entity body  are separated by a sequence of CRLFs.    System Architecture   This section is meant to give you the big picture of a software application system utilizing Java or  other technologies. This section takes the common approach of introducing software system  architecture by observing how it has evolved.   A well-designed software application is partitioned into separate logical parts called layers. Each  layer has a different responsibility in the overall architecture. These layers are purely abstractions,  and do not correspond to physical distribution.   Typical layers in a software system are as follows:      Presentation layer. In this layer are parts that handle the user interface and user   interaction.   of the application.      Business logic layer. This layer contains components that handle the programming logic      Data layer. This layer is used by the business logic layer to persist state permanently.  This layer normally consists of one or more databases where data is stored. However,  other types of datastore could also be used. For example, it is now very common to use  XML documents as storage to keep data.   The Two-Tier Architecture   A two-tiered application is a simple client-server application in which the processing workload  falls onto the client computer's shoulders and the server simply acts as a traffic controller between  the client and the data. The term "fat client" for this type of architecture is due to the bulk of  processing requirements at the client side. In this architecture, the presentation layer and the  business logic layer are hosted in one tier and the data layer is on another tier. Figure I.1 shows a  two-tier architecture.   Figure I.1. A two-tiered application.      The drawback of this type of architecture is that it starts to pose problems as the number of clients  increases. The first problem is due to the fact that all processing happens at the client side. There  is increased network traffic because each client has to make multiple requests for data from the  serveâeven before presenting anything to the user.   Another problem is cost because each client needs a machine with sufficient processing power. As  the number of clients increase, the cost for providing client machines alone could be astronomical.      xvii   However, the most severe problem that this type of architecture can cause is probably a  maintenance problem. Even a tiny change to the processing logic might require a complete rollout  to the entire organization. Even though the process can be automated, there are always problems  with larger organizations because some users may not be ready for an upgrade, whereas others  insist it be performed immediately.   The Three-Tier Architecture   To overcome the problems in many client two-tiered applications, an application is broken up into  three separate tiers, instead of two. The first tier contains the presentation layer, the second tier, or  the middle tier, consists of the business logic layer, and the third tier contains the data layer.  Figure I.2 shows a three-tier architecture.   Figure I.2. A three-tiered application.      The n-Tier Architecture   To achieve more flexibility, the three tiers in the three-tiered application can be segregated even  further. An application with this type of architecture is called an n-tiered application. In this  architecture, the business logic layer is divided by function instead of being physically divided. It  breaks down like the following:      A user interface. This handles the user interaction with the application. In an Internet   application, this is usually a web browser used to render HTML tags.      Presentation logic. This defines what the user interface displays and how user requests   are handled.      Business logic. This models the application business logic.      Infrastructure services. These provide additional functionality required by the  application components.      The data layer. Hosts the application data.     Java 2, Enterprise Edition  J2EE    First of all, J2EE is not a product. Rather, it is a specification that defines the contract between  applications and the container. The container here refers to a standardized runtime environment,  which provides specific services for components deployed in it. J2EE is described in more detail  in Part III, "Developing Scalable Applications with EJB," of this book.    Developing Web Applications in Java   You normally adopt two main architectures when developing web applications in Java. The first  architecture utilizes servlets and JSP in the middle tier to serve clients and process the business      xviii   logic. This architecture is depicted in Figure I.3. The middle tier is discussed during the servlets  and JSP coverage in this book.   Figure I.3. A servlets JSP application architecture.   Small to medium-size applications use this design model.   The second architecture includes the use of J2EE server and Enterprise JavaBeans  EJB  and this  is especially useful for large enterprise applications that need scalability. The architecture is  shown in Figure I.4, and EJB is discussed in Part III of this book.   Figure I.4. A J2EE application architecture.           Overview of Parts and Chapters   This book consists of four parts, including the appendixes.   Part I: Building Java Web Applications   This part is comprised of 20 chapters on servlets and JavaServer Pages  JSP .   Chapter 1, "The Servlet Technology," introduces you to the servlet technology and compares it  with other existing web technologies. More importantly, this chapter prepares you to write servlets,  including the step-by-step instructions on quickly configuring the servlet container, compiling  your servlet, and deploying it in the container. If you follow the instructions correctly, you will be  able to view your servlet in action with your web browser.   Chapter 2, "Inside Servlets," discusses the nuts and bolts of the latest release of the Java Servlet  specification Application Programming Interface  API , version 2.3. This chapter explains the first  of the two packages available for servlet programmers: javax.servlet. This package contains basic  classes and interfaces that you can use to write servlets from the scratch. Important concepts, such  as a servlet's life cycle, a servlet's context, requests, responses, and how to write thread-safe  servlets are discussed in this chapter.      xix   Chapter 3, "Writing Servlet Applications," explains the classes and interfaces in the  javax.servlet.http package. Compared to the javax.servlet package, javax.servlet.http offers more  advanced classes and interfaces that extend classes and interfaces in javax.servlet. This chapter  also demonstrates the use of several techniques, such as obtaining values sent by the user, using  different HTTP methods, response buffering, request dispatching, and including other resources in  a servlet.   Chapter 4, "Accessing Databases with JDBC," shows how you can access and manipulate data in a  database using Java Database Connectivity   JDBC . This chapter starts with a look at the object  model in the java.sql package and explains how to connect to a database in detail. After a few  examples, this chapter concludes with a multipurpose tool that enables you to type your SQL  statement in the browser, get it executed on the server, and have the result displayed in the  browser.   Chapter 5, "Session Management," explains the importance of being able to manage user session  and retain state from previous requests. Several techniques are introduced, such as URL rewriting,  hidden fields, and cookies. However, the servlet container offers its own automatic session  management, a great feature that makes managing user session easy and straightforward.   Chapter 6, "Application and Session Events," discusses the new feature in the Servlet 2.3  specification, as well as several events that have been available since the previous versions of the  specification. This chapter provides examples on how to listen and capture the application and  session events and configure the deployment descriptor.   Chapter 7, "Servlet Filtering," explains another new feature in the Servlet 2.3 specification. This  chapter shows you how you can make full use of servlet filtering to achieve some important tasks,  such as preprocessing an HTTP request.   Chapter 8, "JSP Basics," introduces the second Java web technology that should be used in  conjunction with servlets. This chapter explains situations where you want to use JSP, and  discusses the relation between servlets and JSP.   Chapter 9, "JSP Syntax," presents the complete syntax for JavaServer Pages. In particular, it  discusses directives, scripting elements, and action elements. Wherever possible, examples are  given to illustrate how to use each item.   Chapter 10, "Developing JSP Beans," introduces the component-centric approach for writing JSP  applications using JavaBeans. Using this approach, division of labor is possible. The Java  programmer writes and compiles JavaBeans that incorporate all the functionality needed in an  application and the page designer works with the page design at the same time. When the  JavaBeans are ready, the page designer uses tags to call methods and properties of the beans from  the JSP page.   Chapter 11, "Using JSP Custom Tags," explains what custom tags are and how to use them to  perform custom actions from a JSP page. This chapter explores the great features of custom tags  and begins with writing a JSP page that uses custom tags. It then explains the classes and  interfaces in the javax.servlet.jsp.tagext package.   Chapter 12, "Programmable File Download," discusses a technique that allows you to  programmatically send a file to a browser. Using this technique, you, the programmer, have full  control over the downloaded file. This chapter offers an example of how to do programmable file  download from a JSP page.   Chapter 13, "File Upload," explains all you need to know about file upload, including the  underlying theory of HTTP requests. Knowledge of the HTTP request is critical because when  you process an uploaded file, you work with raw data not obtainable from simply querying the      xx   HTTP Request object. The last section of the chapter talks about the File Upload Bean from  Brainysoftware.com, included on the accompanying CD.   Chapter 14, "Security Configuration," presents the technique for securing your web application by  configuring the deployment descriptor to instruct the web container to restrict access to some, or  all, of the resources. The configuration means that you only need to modify your deployment  descriptor fileâno coding is needed.   Chapter 15, "Caching," offers two caching techniques to enhance the application performance:  caching data in a text file and caching data in memory. The first solution writes frequently  accessed but hardly changed data into text files. When your application needs the data from the  database, instead of hitting the database server, the application can just include a text file. The  second technique can boost performance more dramatically by caching data in memory. This  chapter will show you how you can use these two techniques to improve your application  performance.   Chapter 16, "Application Deployment," discusses the process of deploying a servlet and JSP  application. To understand how to properly display your web application, you need to first  understand the directory structure of an application. Therefore, this chapters starts with a review of  the directory structure. The next topic is the deployment descriptor where you can configure each  application.   Chapter 17, "Architecting Java Web Applications," presents the two models in servlets JSP  applications and discusses how to select the right architecture for your applications.   Chapter 18, "Developing E-Commerce Applications," demonstrates an online store application  that uses Model 2 architecture, which is discussed in Chapter 17. This is a complete application  that covers most of the features in an e-commerce application.   Chapter 19, "XML-Based E-Books" presents a project that can be used as an online help system  whose table of contents is based on an XML document.   Chapter 20, "Web-Based Document Management," offers the complete solution to a document  management tool. The user interface looks like Windows Explorer inside a web browser. You can  explore the database structure that manages all objects representing your documents and extend  the functionality to suit your needs.   Part II: Client-Side Programming with JavaScript   This part contains seven chapters on how to use JavaScript as the client-side programming  language in your web application.   Chapter 21, "JavaScript Basics," presents an introduction to JavaScript and prepares you to  program the client-side of your web application.   Chapter 22, "Client-Side Programming Basics," offers the discussion on the benefits of client-side  programming. These benefits not only contribute to the level of scalability of your web application,  but also to user satisfaction. In this chapter you will learn the sort of problems that you will  encounter when programming for the client side, problems that you should be aware of even  before you write your first line of code.   Chapter 23, "Redirection," discusses various techniques to redirect users to another resource.  Redirection is a commonly used in many web applications, and it is important to be able to select  the right technique for the redirection.      xxi                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®    Chapter 24, "Client-Side Input Validation," provides you with techniques to do input validation on  the client-side. When you apply client-side validation, you ensure that the values of form elements  are valid before the form is submitted. From the server's perspective, this means reduced workload  because it does not have to return the user to the form to correct a value. For users, this means they  receive a much faster response because they get an instant warning when a form entry is not  correct. This chapter discusses the two types of input validation: at the form level and at the form  element level.   Chapter 25, "Working with Client-Side Cookies," looks at cookies in detail, especially how to  manipulate cookies at the client-side  for example, on the browser . This chapter presents tips for  working with cookies, including how to create, delete, and edit a cookie both on the server side  and the client side.   Chapter 26, "Working with Object Trees," offers the technique to work with objects in a hierarchy.  The technique described in this chapter is used for the XML-based online help and document  management projects in Chapter 19 and Chapter 20.   Chapter 27, "Controlling Applets," does not discuss how to write applets. Instead, it discusses a  different aspect of working with applets: how you can control applets from an HTML page using  JavaScript. Controlling an applet includes running an applet's methods, reading its properties, and  passing a value to it for further processing.   Part III: Developing Scalable Applications with EJB   This part offers six chapters on Enterprise JavaBeans to help you develop scalable applications.   Chapter 28, "Enterprise JavaBeans," serves as the introduction to Enterprise JavaBeans  EJB . It  starts with defining what EJB is and presenting some of the benefits of using EJBâmost of which  are not available in servlet JSP. Then, it discusses the architecture and the distinct roles in the EJB  application and deployment life cycle. It then provides a sample application and some technical  insights by presenting a review of the javax.ejb package. Lastly, two client applications are  presented to test the sample application.   Chapter 29, "The Session Bean," presents the first type of enterprise bean: session bean. It starts  with an overview of what a session bean is and explains two types of session beans: stateful and  stateless. After a discussion of the API, it offers an example that demonstrates the use of session  beans and how to write a client application that uses the bean.   Chapter 30, "Entity Beans," explains the two types of entity beans: entity beans with bean- managed persistence  BMP  and entity beans with container-managed persistence  CMP .   Chapter 31, "EJB Query Language," presents the language added to the EJB 2.0 specification: the  Enterprise JavaBeans Query Language  EJB QL . EJB QL is similar to Structured Query  Language  SQL  and is used by bean developers to select data for finder methods of CMP entity  beans.   Chapter 32, "Java Message Service," offers an introduction to messaging and the JMS API. This  chapter also provides several examples that use JMS to send and receive messages. This chapter  should provide the basic knowledge for working with the third type of Enterprise JavaBeans  EJB :  message-driven beans  MDB .   Chapter 33, "Message-Driven Beans," begins with an overview of what a message-driven bean is  and a close look at the object model. It then continues with an example of a message-driven bean  and instruction on how to deploy it in JBoss.      xxii   Appendixes   The last part of this book comprises of seven appendixes, all of which are self-explanatory. The  seven appendixes are as follows:   Appendix A, "Tomcat Installation and Configuration"   Appendix B, "The javax.servlet Package Reference"   Appendix C, "The javax.servlet.http Package Reference"   Appendix D, "The javax.servlet.jsp Package Reference"   Appendix E, "The javax.servlet.jsp.tagext Package Reference"   Appendix F, "JBoss Installation and Configuration"   Appendix G, "Related Resources"   Appendix H, "What's On the CD-ROM?"      xxiii      Part I: Building Java Web Applications   Part I Building Java Web Applications    1 The Servlet Technology     2 Inside Servlets     3 Writing Servlet Applications     4 Accessing Databases with JDBC     5 Session Management     6 Application and Session Events     7 Servlet Filtering     8 JSP Basics     9 JSP Syntax     10 Developing JSP Beans     11 Using JSP Custom Tags     12 Programmable File Download     13 File Upload     14 Security Configuration     15 Caching     16 Application Deployment     17 Architecting Java Web Applications    18 Developing E-Commerce Applications    19 XML Based E-Books     20 Web-Based Document Management     1      Chapter 1. The Servlet Technology   The servlet technology is the foundation of web application development using the Java  programming language. It is one of the most important Java technologies, and it is the underlying  technology for another popular Java technology for web application development: JavaServer  Pages  JSP . Therefore, understanding the servlet technology and its architecture is important if  you want to be a servlet developer. Even if you plan to develop your Java web application using  JSP pages alone, understanding the servlet technology helps you build a more efficient and  effective JSP application.   The aim of this chapter is to introduce the servlet technology and make you comfortable with it by  presenting step-by-step instructions that enable you to build and run a servlet application.   In particular, this chapter discusses the following topics:      The benefits of servlets     Servlet application architecture     How a servlet works     How to write and run your first servlet application   Throughout this book, Tomcat 4.0 is used as both the servlet container and JSP container. In this  chapter, you learn how to configure Tomcat quickly so that you can run your first servlet  application.   Note   For a complete reference on how to configure your application, see Chapter 16,  "Application Deployment." You can find more detail on Tomcat installation in Appendix  A, "Tomcat Installation and Configuration."     The Benefits of Servlets   When it first emerged, this great thing we call the Internet consisted of only static contents written  using Hypertext Markup Language  HTML . At that time, anyone who could author HTML pages  was considered an Internet expert.   This did not last long, however.   Soon dynamic web contents were made possible through the Common Gateway Interface  CGI   technology. CGI enables the web server to call an external program and pass HTTP request  information to that external program to process the request. The response from the external  program is then passed back to the web server, which forwards it to the client browser. CGI  programs can be written in any language that can be called by the web server. Over the course of  time, Perl became the most popular language to write CGI programs.   As the Internet became more and more popular, however, the number of users visiting a popular  web site increased exponentially, and it became apparent that CGI had failed to deliver scalable  Internet applications. The flaw in CGI is that each client request makes the web server spawn a  new process of the requested CGI program. As we all know, process creation is an expensive  operation that consumes a lot of CPU cycles and computer memory.      2      Gradually, new and better technologies will replace CGI as the main technology for web  application development. The world has witnessed the following technologies trying to dominate  web development:      ColdFusion. Allaire's ColdFusion provides HTML-like custom tags that can be used to  perform a number of operations, especially querying a database. This technology had its  glamorous time in the history of the World Wide Web as the main technology for web  application programming. Its glorious time has since gone with the invention of other  technologies.      Server-side JavaScript  SSJS . SSJS is an extension of the JavaScript language, the  scripting language that still rules client-side web programming. SSJS can access Java  classes deployed at the server side using the LiveWire technology from Netscape.      PHP. PHP is an exciting open-source technology that has matured in recent years. The   technology provides easy web application development with its session management and  includes some built-in functionality, such as file upload. The number of programmers  embracing PHP as their technology of choice has risen sharply in recent years.      Servlet. The servlet technology was introduced by Sun Microsystems in 1996. This   technology is the main focus of this book and will be explained in more detail in this and  coming chapters.  JavaServer Pages  JSP . JSP is an extension of the servlet technology. This, too, is the  center of attention in this book.      Active Server Pages  ASP . Microsoft's ASP employs scripting technologies that work   in Windows platforms, even though there have been efforts to port this technology to  other operating systems. Windows ASP works with the Internet Information Server web  server. This technology will soon be replaced by Active Server Pages.NET.      Active Server Pages.NET  ASP.NET . This technology is part of Microsoft's .NET  initiative. Interestingly, the .NET Framework employs a runtime called the Common  Language Runtime that is very similar to Java Virtual Machine and provides a vast class  library available to all .NET languages and from ASP.NET pages. ASP.NET is an  exciting technology. It introduced several new technologies including state management  that does not depend on cookies or URL rewriting.       In the past, ASP and servlet JSP have been the main technologies used in web application  development. With the release of ASP.NET, it is not hard to predict that this technology will  become the servlet JSP's main competitor. ASP  and ASP.NET  and servlet JSP each have their  own fans, and it is not easy to predict which one will come out the winner. The most likely  outcome is that neither will be an absolute winner that corners the market; instead the technologies  will probably run head-to-head in the coming years.   Servlet  and JSP  offers the following benefits that are not necessarily available in other  technologies:      Performance. The performance of servlets is superior to CGI because there is no process   creation for each client request. Instead, each request is handled by the servlet container  process. After a servlet is finished processing a request, it stays resident in memory,  waiting for another request.      Portability. Similar to other Java technologies, servlet applications are portable. You can   move them to other operating systems without serious hassles.      Rapid development cycle. As a Java technology, servlets have access to the rich Java   library, which helps speed up the development process.      Robustness. Servlets are managed by the Java Virtual Machine. As such, you don't need   to worry about memory leak or garbage collection, which helps you write robust  applications.      Widespread acceptance. Java is a widely accepted technology. This means that   numerous vendors work on Java-based technologies. One of the advantages of this      3      widespread acceptance is that you can easily find and purchase components that suit your  needs, which saves precious development time.     Servlet Application Architecture   A servlet is a Java class that can be loaded dynamically into and run by a special web server. This  servlet-aware web server is called a servlet container, which also was called a servlet engine in the  early days of the servlet technology.   Servlets interact with clients via a request-response model based on HTTP. Because servlet  technology works on top of HTTP, a servlet container must support HTTP as the protocol for  client requests and server responses. However, a servlet container also can support similar  protocols, such as HTTPS  HTTP over SSL  for secure transactions.   Figure 1.1 provides the architecture of a servlet application.   Figure 1.1. The servlet application architecture.   In a JSP application, the servlet container is replaced by a JSP container. Both the servlet  container and the JSP container often are referred to as the web container or servlet JSP container,  especially if a web application consists of both servlets and JSP pages.      Note   You will learn more about servlet and JSP containers in Chapter 8, "JSP Basics."   As you can see in the Figure 1.1, a servlet application also can include static content, such as  HTML pages and image files. Allowing the servlet container to serve static content is not  preferable because the content is faster if served by a more robust HTTP server, such as the  Apache web server or Microsoft Internet Information Server. As such, it is common practice to  put a web server at the front to handle all client requests. The web server serves static content and  passes to the servlet containers all client requests for servlets. Figure 1.2 shows a more common  architecture for a servlet application.   Figure 1.2. The servlet application architecture employing an HTTP server.   Caution   A Java web application architecture employing a J2EE server is different from the  diagrams in Figures 1.1 and 1.2. This is discussed in Chapter 28, "Enterprise JavaBeans."         4        How a Servlet Works   A servlet is loaded by the servlet container the first time the servlet is requested. The servlet then  is forwarded the user request, processes it, and returns the response to the servlet container, which  in turn sends the response back to the user. After that, the servlet stays in memory waiting for  other requestsâit will not be unloaded from the memory unless the servlet container sees a  shortage of memory. Each time the servlet is requested, however, the servlet container compares  the timestamp of the loaded servlet with the servlet class file. If the class file timestamp is more  recent, the servlet is reloaded into memory. This way, you don't need to restart the servlet  container every time you update your servlet.   The way in which a servlet works inside the servlet container is depicted in the diagram in Figure  1.3.   Figure 1.3. How a servlet works.     The Tomcat Servlet Container      A number of servlet containers are available today. The most popular oneâand the one  recognized as the official servlet JSP containerâis Tomcat. Originally designed by Sun  Microsystems, Tomcat source code was handed over to the Apache Software Foundation in  October 1999. In this new home, Tomcat was included as part of the Jakarta Project, one of the      5      projects of the Apache Software Foundation. Working through the Apache process, Apache, Sun,  and other companiesâwith the help of volunteer programmers worldwideâturned Tomcat into a  world-class servlet reference implementation. Two months after the handover, Tomcat version 3.0  was released. Tomcat went through several 3.x releases until version 3.3 was introduced.   The successor of version 3.3 is the current version, version 4.0. The 4.0 servlet container  Catalina   is based on a completely new architecture and has been developed from the ground up for  flexibility and performance. Version 4.0 implements the Servlet 2.3 and JSP 1.2 specifications,  and it is this version you will be using in this book.   Another popular servlet container is JRun from Allaire Corporation. JRun is available in three  editions: Developer, Professional, and Enterprise. The Developer edition is free but not licensed  for deployment. The Professional and Enterprise editions grant you the license for deployment  with a fee. You can download JRun from http:  commerce.allaire.com download.   Tomcat by itself is a web server. This means that you can use Tomcat to service HTTP requests  for servlets, as well as static files  HTML, image files, and so on . In practice, however, since it is  faster for non-servlet, non-JSP requests, Tomcat normally is used as a module with another more  robust web server, such as Apache web server or Microsoft Internet Information Server. Only  requests for servlets or JSP pages are passed to Tomcat.   To write a servlet, you need at least version 1.2 of the Java Development Kit. If you have not  already downloaded one, you can download JDK 1.2 from http:  java.sun.com j2se. The reference  implementation for both servlets and JSP are not included in J2SE, but they are included in  Tomcat. Tomcat is written purely in Java.   If you haven't yet installed and configured Tomcat, now's the time to do it. If you need help with  these tasks, refer to Appendix A for specific steps.    Six Steps to Running Your First Servlet   After you have installed and configured Tomcat, you can put it into service. Basically, you need to  follow six steps to go from writing your servlet to running it. These steps are summarized as  follows:   1.  Create a directory structure under Tomcat for your application.  2.  Write the servlet source code. You need to import the javax.servlet package and the   javax.servlet.http package in your source file.   3.  Compile your source code.  4.  Create a deployment descriptor.  5.  Run Tomcat.  6.  Call your servlet from a web browser.   The sections that follow walk you through each of these steps.   Step 1: Create a Directory Structure Under Tomcat   Note   The directory where Tomcat is installed is often referred to as %CATALINA_HOME%.  In previous versions of Tomcat, this directory was called %TOMCAT_HOME%.      6      When you install Tomcat, several subdirectories are automatically created under the Tomcat home  directory  %CATALINA_HOME% . One of the subdirectories is webapps. The webapps  directory is where you store your web applications. A web application is a collection of servlets  and other content installed under a specific subset of the server's URL namespace. A separate  directory is dedicated for each servlet application. Therefore, the first thing to do when you build a  servlet application is create an application directory. To create a directory structure for an  application called myApp, follow these steps:   1.  Create a directory called myApp under the webapps directory. The directory name is   important because this also appears in the URL to your servlet.   2.  Create the and WEB-INF directories under myApp, and create a directory named classes   under WEB-INF. The directory structure is shown in Figure 1.4. The directory classes  under WEB-INF is for your Java classes. If you have HTML files, put them directly under  the myApp directory. You may also want to create a directory called images under  myApp for all your image files.   Figure 1.4. Tomcat application directory structure.      Note that the examples, manager, ROOT, tomcat-doc, and webdav directories are for  applications that are created automatically when you install Tomcat.   Step 2: Write the Servlet Source Code   In this step, you prepare your source code. You can write the source code yourself using your  favorite text editor or copy it from the accompanying CD.   Tip   The source code for all examples in this book are also available on the book's web site.  Check out www.newriders.com to download the files you need.   The code in Listing 1.1 shows a simple servlet called TestingServlet. The file is named  TestingServlet.java. The servlet sends a few HTML tags and some text to the browser. For now,  don't worry if you haven't got a clue about how it works.   Listing 1.1 TestingServlet.java   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;       7      import java.io.*;   import java.util.*;     public class TestingServlet extends HttpServlet {      public void doGet HttpServletRequest request,       HttpServletResponse response        throws ServletException, IOException {        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Servlet Testing " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println "Welcome to the Servlet Testing Center" ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;     }   }   Now, save your TestingServlet.java file to the WEB-INF classes directory under myApp. Placing  your source code here will make it inaccessible from a web browser. Static files, such as HTML  files and image files, should be placed directly under the myApp directory or a directory under it.   Warning   Placing your source code files outside the WEB-INF directory will make them viewable  from a browser.   Step 3: Compile Your Source Code   For your servlet source code to compile, you need to include the path to the servlet.jar file in your  CLASSPATH environment variable. The servlet.jar is located in the common\lib\ subdirectory  under %CATALINA_HOME%.   For example, if you installed Tomcat under the C:\drive on Windows and you named the install  directory tomcat, type the following command from the directory where TestingServlet.java  resides.   javac -classpath C:\tomcat\common\lib\servlet.jar TestingServlet.java   Alternatively, to save you typing the class path every time you compile your source code, you can  add the complete path to the servlet.jar file to your CLASSPATH environment variable. Again, if  you have installed Tomcat under C:\and named the install directory tomcat, you must add  C:\tomcat\ common\lib\servlet.jar to the CLASSPATH environment variable. Afterward, you can  compile your source by simply typing the following.   javac TestingServlet.java   Note   If you have forgotten how to edit the CLASSPATH environment variable, refer to  Appendix A.      8                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       If you are using Windows, remember that the new environment variable takes effect only for new  console windows. In other words, after changing a new environment variable, open a new console  window for typing in your command lines.   Step 4: Create the Deployment Descriptor   A deployment descriptor is an optional component in a servlet application. The descriptor takes  the form of an XML document called web.xml and must be located in the WEB-INF directory of  the servlet application. When present, the deployment descriptor contains configuration settings  specific to that application. Deployment descriptors are discussed in detail in Chapter 16.   To create the deployment descriptor, you now need to create a web.xml file and place it under the  WEB-INF directory under myApp.   The web.xml for this example application must have the following content.         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                    Testing         TestingServlet              The web.xml file has one elementâweb-app. You should write all your servlets under  .  For each servlet, you have a   element and you need the   and <servlet- class> elements. The   is the name for your servlet, by which it is known Tomcat.  The   is the compiled file of your servlet without the .class extension.   Having more than one servlet in an application is very common. For every servlet, you need a    element in the web.xml file. For example, the following shows you how web.xml looks  if you add another servlet called Login:         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                    Testing         TestingServlet                     Login         LoginServlet              Step 5: Run Tomcat      9      If Tomcat is not already running, you need to start it. See Appendix A for information on how to  start or run Tomcat.   Step 6: Call Your Servlet from a Web Browser   Now, you can call your servlet from a web browser. By default, Tomcat runs on port 8080 in the  myApp virtual directory under the servlet subdirectory. The servlet that you wrote in the  preceding steps is named Testing. The URL for that servlet has the following format:   http:  domain-name virtual-directory servlet servlet-name   Any static file can be accessed using the following URL:   http:  domain-name virtual-directory staticFile.html   For example, a Logo.gif file under the myApp images  directory can be accessed using the  following URL.   http:  domain-name virtual-directory images Logo.gif   If you run the web browser from the same computer as Tomcat, you can replace the domain-name  part with "localhost". In that case, the URL for your servlet is   http:  localhost:8080 myApp servlet Testing   In the deployment descriptor you wrote in Step 4, you actually mapped the servlet class file called  TestingServlet with the name "Testing," so that your servlet can be called by specifying its class  file  TestingServlet  or its name  Testing . Without a deployment descriptor, you must call the  servlet by specifying its class name; that is, TestingServlet. This means that if you did not write a  deployment descriptor in Step 4, you need to use the following URL to call your servlet:   http:  localhost:8080 myApp servlet TestingServlet   Typing the URL in the Address or Location box of your web browser will give you the string  "Welcome to the Servlet Testing Center," as shown in Figure 1.5.   Figure 1.5. The Testing servlet.      10      Congratulations. You have just written your first servlet.   If you don't want to type the port number each time, you can change the default port of Tomcat so  that it runs on port 80, the default port for a web server.  Details on how to change the port  number can be found in Appendix A.  However, the rest of the book will use Tomcat's default port  8080.   You will find code for various servlets in this chapter and the next. To run each individual  servlet, you need to repeat these six steps. To avoid repetition, I do not mention these  steps for every servlet presented in this book. You don't need to worry about these steps if  you are using a Java development tool, such as Borland's JBuilder or IBM's VisualAge,  because those steps are taken care of by the RAD program.      Note     Summary   This chapter has given you the big picture of how to build a servlet application. Specifically, you  learned about the benefits of servlets, explored servlet application architecture, and discovered  how a servlet works inside the servlet container. You also have been shown how to configure  Tomcat and followed the six steps you need to build your own servlets. The next chapter digs  deeper into the servlet technology by presenting the Java Servlet specification Application  Programming Interface  API  version 2.3      11      Chapter 2. Inside Servlets   Watching your servlet in action, as you did in Chapter 1, "The Servlet Technology," should bring  you confidence. And, as some people say, having confidence is half the battle in learning anything.  To be an expert, however, you need to understand the nuts and bolts of the Java Servlet  specification Application Programming Interface  API . This book has been written using the  latest release of the servlet specification APIâversion 2.3. Two packages are available for servlet  programmers: javax.servlet and javax.servlet.http. The first one contains basic classes and  interfaces that you can use to write servlets from the scratch. The second package,  javax.servlet.http, offers more advanced classes and interfaces that extend classes and interfaces  from the first package. It is much more convenient to program using the second package.   When you learn something, it is best to start with the basics and build a strong foundation. For  example, understanding the javax.servlet.Servlet interface is very important because it  encapsulates the life cycle methods of a servlet and it is the interface that all servlets must  implement. You also need to know the servlet's context, which represents a servlet's environment,  and the servlet's configuration. Because of the importance of these items, this chapter introduces  you to members of the javax.servlet package. In this chapter, you also will see that oftentimes  several ways exist to do the same thing.   After a few examples, I will introduce you to the GenericServlet class, a member of the  javax.servlet package that acts as a wrapper for the javax.servlet.Servlet interface. Extending this  class makes your code simpler because you need to provide implementations only for methods  that you need to use.   To run each example in this chapter, you need to compile the source code and copy the resulting  class file into the classes directory under the WEB-INF directory of your application. Refer to  Chapter 1 if you have forgotten the six steps you need to run your servlet.   The rest of this chapter explains and uses the interfaces and classes of the javax.servlet package.  The chapters that follow focus more on the second package.    The javax.servlet Package   The javax.servlet package contains seven interfaces, three classes, and two exceptions. Instead of  using the conventional approach by explaining each interface and class in alphabetical orderâthus  making the book feel like a dictionaryâI present the discussions based on functions and offer  examples that demonstrate each function.   Nevertheless, mastering all the members of this package is important. To help you, a complete  reference is given in Appendix B, "The javax.servlet Package Reference."   The seven interfaces are as follows:      RequestDispatcher     Servlet     ServletConfig     ServletContext     ServletRequest     ServletResponse     SingleThreadModel      12      The three classes are as follows:      GenericServlet     ServletInputStream     ServletOutputStream   And, finally, the exception classes are these:      ServletException     UnavailableException   The object model of the javax.servlet package is shown in Figure 2.1.   Figure 2.1. The javax.servlet package object model.        A Servlet's Life Cycle   Let there be servlet. This interface in the javax.servlet package is the source of all activities in  servlet programming. Servlet is the central abstraction of the Java servlet technology. Every  servlet you write must implement this javax.servlet.Servlet interface, either directly or indirectly.  The life cycle of a servlet is determined by three of its methods: init, service, and destroy.   The init   Method   The init method is called by the servlet container after the servlet class has been instantiated. The  servlet container calls this method exactly once to indicate to the servlet that the servlet is being  placed into service. The init method must complete successfully before the servlet can receive any  requests.   You can override this method to write initialization code that needs to run only once, such as  loading a database driver, initializing values, and so on. In other cases, you normally leave this  method blank.   The signature of this method is as follows:      13      public void init ServletConfig config  throws ServletException   The init method is important also because the servlet container passes a ServletConfig object,  which contains the configuration values stated in the web.xml file for this application. More on  ServletConfig can be found later in this chapter, in the section, "Obtaining Configuration  Information."   This method also can throw a ServletException. The servlet container cannot place the servlet into  service if the init method throws a ServletException or the method does not return within a time  period defined by the web server.   Note   The service   Method   ServletException is the most important exception in servlet programming. In fact, a lot of  methods in the javax.servlet and javax.servlet.http packages can throw this exception  when a problem exists in a servlet.   The service method is called by the servlet container after the servlet's init method to allow the  servlet to respond to a request.   Servlets typically run inside multithreaded servlet containers that can handle multiple requests  concurrently. Therefore, you must be aware to synchronize access to any shared resources, such as  files, network connections, and the servlet's class and instance variables. For example, if you open  a file and write to that file from a servlet, you need to remember that a different thread of the same  servlet also can open the same file. See the section, "Creating Thread-Safe Servlets," for more on  the topic of multithreading and synchronization.   This method has the following signature:   public void service ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response      throws ServletException, java.io.IOException   The servlet container passes a ServletRequest object and the ServletResponse object. The  ServletRequest object contains the client's request and the ServletResponse contains the servlet's  response. These two objects are important because they enable you to write custom code that  determines how the servlet services the client request.   The service method throws a ServletException if an exception occurs that interferes with the  servlet's normal operation. The service method also can throw a java.io.IOException if an input or  output exception occurs during the execution of this method.   As the name implies, the service method exists so that you can write code that makes the servlet  function the way it is supposed to.   The destroy   Method   The servlet container calls the destroy method before removing a servlet instance from service.  This normally happens when the servlet container is shut down or the servlet container needs  some free memory.   This method is called only after all threads within the servlet's service method have exited or after  a timeout period has passed. After the servlet container calls this method, it will not call the  service method again on this servlet.      14      The destroy method gives the servlet an opportunity to clean up any resources that are being held   for example, memory, file handles, and threads  and make sure that any persistent state is  synchronized with the servlet's current state in memory.   The signature of this method is as follows:   public void destroy     Demonstrating the Life Cycle of a Servlet   Listing 2.1 contains the code for a servlet named PrimitiveServlet, a very simple servlet that exists  to demonstrate the life cycle of a servlet. The PrimitiveServlet class implements  javax.servlet.Servlet  as all servlets must  and provides implementations for all the five methods  of servlet. What it does is very simple. Each time any of the init, service, or destroy methods is  called, the servlet writes the method's name to the console.   Listing 2.1 PrimitiveServlet.java   import javax.servlet.*;   import java.io.IOException;     public class PrimitiveServlet implements Servlet {      public void init ServletConfig config  throws ServletException {      System.out.println "init" ;     }       public void service ServletRequest request, ServletResponse  response        throws ServletException, IOException {      System.out.println "service" ;     }       public void destroy   {      System.out.println "destroy" ;     }       public String getServletInfo   {      return null;     }     public ServletConfig getServletConfig   {      return null;     }     }   After you compile the source code into the myApp\WEB-INF\classes directory, add the servlet to  the web.xml under the name Primitive, as shown in Listing 2.2.   Listing 2.2 The web.xml File for PrimitiveServlet         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                   15      init   service   service        Primitive         PrimitiveServlet              You should then be able to call this servlet from your browser by typing the following URL:   http:  localhost:8080 myApp servlet Primitive   The first time the servlet is called, the console displays these two lines:   This tells you that the init method is called, followed by the service method. However, on  subsequent requests, only the service method is called. The servlet adds the following line to the  console:   This proves that the init method is called only once.   What are the getServletInfo and getServletConfig doing in Listing 2.1 ? Nothing. They can be  useful, but in the PrimitiveServlet class, they are just there to meet the specification that a class  must provide implementations for all methods in the interface it implements.   You can return any string in the getServletInfo method, such as your company name or the author  name or other information deemed necessary. Other people might extend your servlet class and  might want to know what useful information the designer of the servlet has provided.   The getServletConfig is more important. We will see how it can be of use next.    Obtaining Configuration Information   The servlet specification allows you to configure your application. You'll find more information  on this topic in the discussion of the deployment descriptor in Chapter 16, "Application  Deployment." In this chapter, I present an example that demonstrates how you can retrieve  configuration information from the application web.xml file.   Note   You need to restart Tomcat for the changes in the deployment descriptor  the web.xml  file  to take effect.   For each servlet registered in the web.xml file, you have the option of specifying a set of initial  parameter name value pairs that you can retrieve from inside the servlet. The following web.xml  file contains a servlet called ConfigDemo whose class is named ConfigDemoServlet.class. The  servlet has two initial parameter name value pairs. The first parameter is named adminEmail and  its value is admin@brainysoftware.com. The second parameter is named  adminContactNumber and the value for this parameter is 04298371237.           16      <!DOCTYPE web-app       PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.2  EN"       "http:  java.sun.com j2ee dtds web-app_2.2.dtd">                    ConfigDemo         ConfigDemoServlet                   adminEmail           admin@brainysoftware.com                           adminContactNumber           04298371237                      Why would you want to use an initial parameter? For practicality. Hardcoding information in the  servlet code means that you have to recompile the servlet if the information changes. A web.xml  file is plain text. You can edit its content easily using a text editor.   The code that retrieves the initial parameter name and values is given in Listing 2.3.   To retrieve initial parameters, you need the ServletConfig object passed by the servlet container to  the servlet. After you get the ServletConfig object, you then can use its getInitParameterNames  and getInitParameter methods. The getInitParameterNames does not take an argument and returns  an Enumeration containing all the parameter names in the ServletConfig object. The  getInitParameter takes a String containing the parameter name and returns a String containing the  value of the parameter.   Because the servlet container passes a ServletConfig object to the init method, it is easiest to write  the code in the init method. The code in Listing 2.3 loops through the Enumeration object called  parameters that is returned from the getInitParameterNames method. For each parameter, it  outputs the parameter name and value. The parameter value is retrieved using the getInitParameter  method.   Listing 2.3 Retrieving Initial Parameters   import javax.servlet.*;   import java.util.Enumeration;   import java.io.IOException;     public class ConfigDemoServlet implements Servlet {      public void init ServletConfig config  throws ServletException {      Enumeration parameters = config.getInitParameterNames  ;       while  parameters.hasMoreElements    {        String parameter =  String  parameters.nextElement  ;         System.out.println "Parameter name : " + parameter ;         System.out.println "Parameter value : " +           config.getInitParameter parameter  ;       }     }       public void destroy   {    }         17        public void service ServletRequest request, ServletResponse  response        throws ServletException, IOException {    }       public String getServletInfo   {      return null;     }       public ServletConfig getServletConfig   {      return null;     }   }   The output of the code in the console is as follows:   Parameter name : adminContactNumber   Parameter value : 04298371237   Parameter name : adminEmail   Parameter value : admin@brainysoftware.com    Preserving the ServletConfig   The code in Listing 2.3 shows how you can use the ServletConfig object in the init method.  Sometimes, however, you may want more flexibility. For example, you may want to have access  to the ServletConfig object from the service method, when you are servicing the user. In this case,  you need to preserve the ServletConfig object to a class level variable. This task is not difficult.  You need to create a ServletConfig object variable and set it to the ServletConfig object returned  by the servlet container in the init method.   Listing 2.4 gives the code that preserves the ServletConfig object for later use. First, you need a  variable for the ServletConfig object.   ServletConfig servletConfig;   Then, in the init method, you write the following code:   servletConfig = config;   Now the servletConfig variable references the ServletConfig object returned by the servlet  container. The getServletConfig method is provided to do just that: return the ServletConfig object.   public ServletConfig getServletConfig   {    return servletConfig;   }   If you extend the ReserveConfigServlet class, you can still retrieve the ServlerConfig object by  calling the getServletConfig method.   Listing 2.4 Preserving the ServletConfig Object   import javax.servlet.*;   import java.io.IOException;       18                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®         public class ReserveConfigServlet implements Servlet {    ServletConfig servletConfig;       public void init ServletConfig config  throws ServletException {      servletConfig = config;     }       public void destroy   {    }       public void service ServletRequest request, ServletResponse  response        throws ServletException, IOException {    }       public String getServletInfo   {      return null;     }       public ServletConfig getServletConfig   {      return servletConfig;     }     }    The Servlet Context   In servlet programming, the servlet context is the environment where the servlet runs. The servlet  container creates a ServletContext object that you can use to access information about the servlet's  environment.   A servlet also can bind an object attribute into the context by name. Any object bound into a  context is available to any other servlet that is part of the same web application.   How do you obtain the ServletContext object? Indirectly, from the ServletConfig object passed by  the servlet container to the servlet's init method. The ServletConfig interface has a method called  getServletContext that returns the ServletContext object. You then can use the ServletContext  interface's various methods to get the information you need. These methods include the following:   getMajorVersion. This method returns an integer representing the major version for the  servlet API that the servlet container supports. If the servlet container supports the servlet  API version 2.3, this method will return 2.  getMinorVersion. This method returns an integer representing the minor version of the  servlet API that the servlet container supports. For the servlet API version 2.3, this  method will return 3.  getAttributeNames. This method returns an enumeration of strings representing the  names of the attributes currently stored in the ServletContext.  getAttribute. This method accepts a String containing the attribute name and returns the  object bound to that name.  setAttribute. This method stores an object in the ServletContext and binds the object to  the given name. If the name already exists in the ServletContext, the old bound object will  be replaced by the object passed to this method.                          19          removeAttribute. This method removes from the ServletContext the object bound to a  name. The removeAttribute method accepts one argument: the name of the attribute to be  removed.   The code in Listing 2.5 shows a servlet named ContextDemoServlet that retrieves some of the  servlet context information, including attribute names and values, minor and major versions of the  servlet container, and the server info.   Listing 2.5 Retrieving Servlet Context Information   import javax.servlet.*;   import java.util.Enumeration;   import java.io.IOException;     public class ContextDemoServlet implements Servlet {    ServletConfig servletConfig;       public void init ServletConfig config  throws ServletException {      servletConfig = config;     }       public void destroy   {    }       public void service ServletRequest request, ServletResponse  response        throws ServletException, IOException {        ServletContext servletContext = servletConfig.getServletContext  ;       Enumeration attributes = servletContext.getAttributeNames  ;       while  attributes.hasMoreElements    {        String attribute =  String  attributes.nextElement  ;         System.out.println "Attribute name : " + attribute ;         System.out.println "Attribute value : " +           servletContext.getAttribute attribute  ;       }         System.out.println "Major version : " +   servletContext.getMajorVersion   ;      System.out.println "Minor version : " +   servletContext.getMinorVersion   ;      System.out.println "Server info : " +  servletContext.getServerInfo   ;    }       public String getServletInfo   {      return null;     }     public ServletConfig getServletConfig   {      return null;     }     }   The output of the code is as follows. This output may be different on your computer, depending on  the version of Tomcat you are using, the operating system, and so on.   Attribute name : javax.servlet.context.tempdirAttribute value :   ..\work\localhost\myApp   Attribute name : org.apache.catalina.resources       20      Attribute value : org.apache.naming.resources.ProxyDirContext@24e2e3   Attribute name : org.apache.catalina.WELCOME_FILES   Attribute value : [Ljava.lang.String;@2bb7e0   Attribute name : org.apache.catalina.jsp_classpath   Attribute value : C:\tomcat4\webapps\myApp\WEB-INF\classes;   .   .   .  Major version : 2  Minor version : 3   Server info : Apache Tomcat 4.0-b5    Sharing Information Among Servlets   For some applications, you want to make certain types of information available to all the servlets.  You can share this informationâsuch as a database connection string or a page countâamong the  servlets by using attributes in the ServletContext object.   The following example uses two servlets: AttributeSetterServlet and DisplayAttributesServlet.  The AttributeSetterServlet servlet, shown in Listing 2.6, binds the name password to a String  object containing the word "ding-dong". The servlet does this by first obtaining the ServletContext  object from the ServletConfig object passed by the servlet container to the init method. Then the  servlet uses the setAttribute method to bind "password" with "ding-dong".   Listing 2.6 The AttributeSetterServlet   import javax.servlet.*;   import java.io.IOException;     public class AttributeSetterServlet implements Servlet {      public void init ServletConfig config  throws ServletException {         bind an object that is to be shared among other servlets       ServletContext servletContext = config.getServletContext  ;       servletContext.setAttribute "password", "dingdong" ;     }       public void service ServletRequest request, ServletResponse  response        throws ServletException, IOException {    }       public void destroy   {    }       public String getServletInfo   {      return null;     }       public ServletConfig getServletConfig   {      return null;     }   }      21      The code in Listing 2.7 is the servlet that retrieves all attribute name value pairs in the  ServletContext object. The init method of this servlet preserves the ServletConfig object into  servletConfig. The service method then uses the ServletConfig interface's getServletContext  method to obtain the ServletContext object. After you get the ServletContext object, you can then  use its getAttributeNames method to get an Enumeration of all attribute names and loop through it  to obtain each attribute's value, which it outputs to the console along with the attribute name.   Listing 2.7 DisplayAttributesServlet   import javax.servlet.*;   import java.io.IOException;   import java.util.Enumeration;     public class DisplayAttributesServlet implements Servlet {    ServletConfig servletConfig;       public void init ServletConfig config  throws ServletException {      servletConfig = config;     }       public void destroy   {    }       public void service ServletRequest request, ServletResponse  response        throws ServletException, IOException {        ServletContext servletContext = servletConfig.getServletContext  ;       Enumeration attributes = servletContext.getAttributeNames  ;       while  attributes.hasMoreElements    {        String attribute =  String  attributes.nextElement  ;         System.out.println "Attribute name : " + attribute ;         System.out.println "Attribute value : " +           servletContext.getAttribute attribute  ;       }     }       public String getServletInfo   {      return null;     }       public ServletConfig getServletConfig   {      return null;     }   }    Enumeration attributes = servletContext.getAttributeNames  ;     while  attributes.hasMoreElements    {      String attribute =  String  attributes.nextElement  ;       System.out.println "Attribute name : " + attribute ;       System.out.println "Attribute value : " +         servletContext.getAttribute attribute  ;   }   To see the servlets work, first you need to call the AttributeSetterServlet servlet to set the attribute  "password". You then call the DisplayAttributesServlet to get an Enumeration of the names of all  attributes and display the values.   The output is given here:      22      Attribute name : javax.servlet.context.tempdir   Attribute value :  C:\123data\JavaProjects\JavaWebBook\work\localhost_8080   Attribute name : password   Attribute value : dingdong   Attribute name : sun.servlet.workdir   Attribute value :  C:\123data\JavaProjects\JavaWebBook\work\localhost_8080    Requests and Responses   Requests and responses are what a web application is all about. In a servlet application, a user  using a web browser sends a request to the servlet container, and the servlet container passes the  request to the servlet.   In a servlet paradigm, the user request is represented by the ServletRequest object passed by the  servlet container as the first argument to the service method. The service method's second  argument is a ServletResponse object, which represents the response to the user.   The ServletRequest Interface   The ServletRequest interface defines an object used to encapsulate information about the user's  request, including parameter name value pairs, attributes, and an input stream.   The ServletRequest interface provides important methods that enable you to access information  about the user. For example, the getParameterNames method returns an Enumeration containing  the parameter names for the current request. To get the value of each parameter, the  ServletRequest interface provides the getParameter method.   The getRemoteAddress and getRemoteHost methods are two methods that you can use to retrieve  the user's computer identity. The first returns a string representing the IP address of the computer  the client is using, and the second method returns a string representing the qualified host name of  the computer.   The following example, shown in Listings 2.8 and 2.9, shows a ServletRequest object in action.  The example consists of an HTML form in a file named index.html that you need to put in the  application directoryâthat is, under myAppâand a servlet called RequestDemoServlet.   Listing 2.8 index.html            Sending a request                     Author:                            23      Listing 2.9 RequestDemoServlet   import javax.servlet.*;   import java.util.Enumeration;   import java.io.IOException;     public class RequestDemoServlet implements Servlet {      public void init ServletConfig config  throws ServletException {    }       public void destroy   {    }       public void service ServletRequest request, ServletResponse  response        throws ServletException, IOException {        System.out.println "Server Port: " + request.getServerPort   ;       System.out.println "Server Name: " + request.getServerName   ;       System.out.println "Protocol: " + request.getProtocol   ;       System.out.println "Character Encoding: " +         request.getCharacterEncoding   ;       System.out.println "Content Type: " + request.getContentType   ;       System.out.println "Content Length: " +  request.getContentLength   ;       System.out.println "Remote Address: " + request.getRemoteAddr   ;       System.out.println "Remote Host: " + request.getRemoteHost   ;       System.out.println "Scheme: " + request.getScheme   ;       Enumeration parameters = request.getParameterNames  ;       while  parameters.hasMoreElements    {        String parameterName =  String  parameters.nextElement  ;         System.out.println "Parameter Name: " + parameterName ;         System.out.println "Parameter Value: " +           request.getParameter parameterName  ;       }       Enumeration attributes = request.getAttributeNames  ;       while  attributes.hasMoreElements    {        String attribute =  String  attributes.nextElement  ;         System.out.println "Attribute name: " + attribute ;         System.out.println "Attribute value: " +           request.getAttribute attribute  ;       }     }       public String getServletInfo   {      return null;     }       public ServletConfig getServletConfig   {      return null;     }     }   To run the example, first request the index.html file by using the following URL:   http:  localhost:8080 myApp index.html   Figure 2.2 shows the index.html file in which "haywood" has been typed in as the value for author.      24      Figure 2.2. The index.html file.      When you submit the form, you should see the list of attribute names and values in your console.   The ServletResponse Interface   The ServletResponse interface represents the response to the user. The most important method of  this interface is getWriter, from which you can obtain a java.io.PrintWriter object that you can use  to write HTML tags and other text to the user.   The code in Listings 2.10 and 2.11 offer an HTML file named index2.html and a servlet whose  service method is overridden with code that outputs some HTML tags to the user. This servlet  modifies the example in Listings 2.8 and 2.9 that retrieves various information about the user.  Instead of sending the information to the console, the service method sends it back to the user.   Note that the code in Listing 2.10 is similar to the code in Listing 2.8, except that in Listing 2.10  the value for the form's ACTION attribute is servlet ResponseDemoServlet.   Listing 2.10 index2.html            Sending a request                     Author:                         25          Listing 2.11 The ResponseDemoServlet   import javax.servlet.*;   import java.io.PrintWriter;   import java.io.IOException;   import java.util.Enumeration;     public class ResponseDemoServlet implements Servlet {      public void init ServletConfig config  throws ServletException {    }     public void destroy   {    }       public void service ServletRequest request, ServletResponse  response        throws ServletException, IOException {        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println "ServletResponse" ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Demonstrating the ServletResponse object " ;       out.println " " ;         out.println " Server Port: " + request.getServerPort   ;       out.println " Server Name: " + request.getServerName   ;       out.println " Protocol: " + request.getProtocol   ;       out.println " Character Encoding: " +  request.getCharacterEncoding   ;       out.println " Content Type: " + request.getContentType   ;       out.println " Content Length: " + request.getContentLength   ;       out.println " Remote Address: " + request.getRemoteAddr   ;       out.println " Remote Host: " + request.getRemoteHost   ;       out.println " Scheme: " + request.getScheme   ;       Enumeration parameters = request.getParameterNames  ;       while  parameters.hasMoreElements    {        String parameterName =  String  parameters.nextElement  ;         out.println " Parameter Name: " + parameterName ;         out.println " Parameter Value: " +           request.getParameter parameterName  ;       }       Enumeration attributes = request.getAttributeNames  ;       while  attributes.hasMoreElements    {        String attribute =  String  attributes.nextElement  ;         out.println " Attribute name: " + attribute ;         out.println " Attribute value: " +  request.getAttribute attribute  ;       }       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;     }       public String getServletInfo   {      return null;       26        }       public ServletConfig getServletConfig   {      return null;     }     }   To run the example, first request the index2.html file by using the following URL:   http:  localhost:8080 myApp index2.html   Figure 2.3 shows the index2.html file in which "haywood" has been typed in as the value for  author.   Figure 2.3. The index2.html file.   When you submit the form, the ResponseDemoServlet is invoked and your browser should display  an image similar to Figure 2.4.   Figure 2.4. Utilizing the ServletResponse object.         27           The GenericServlet Wrapper Class   Throughout this chapter, you have been creating servlet classes that implement the  javax.servlet.Servlet interface. Everything works fine, but there are two annoying things that  you've probably noticed:   1.  You have to provide implementations for all five methods of the Servlet interface, even   though most of the time you only need one. This makes your code look unnecessarily  complicated.   2.  The ServletConfig object is passed to the init method. You need to preserve this object to   use it from other methods. This is not difficult, but it means extra work.   The javax.servlet package provides a wrapper class called GenericServlet that implements two  important interfaces from the javax.servlet package: Servlet and ServletConfig, as well as the  java.io.Serializable interface. The GenericServlet class provides implementations for all methods,  most of which are blank. You can extend GenericServlet and override only methods that you need  to use. Clearly, this looks like a better solution.   The code in Listing 2.12 is a servlet called SimpleServlet that extends GenericServlet. The code  provides the implementation of the service method that sends some output to the browser. Because  the service method is the only method you need, only this method needs to appear in the class.  Compared to all servlet classes that implement the javax.servlet.Servlet interface directly,  SimpleServlet looks much cleaner and clearer.   Listing 2.12 Extending GenericServlet   import javax.servlet.*;   import java.io.IOException;   import java.io.PrintWriter;       28                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®         public class SimpleServlet extends GenericServlet {      public void service ServletRequest request, ServletResponse  response        throws ServletException, IOException {        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println "Extending GenericServlet" ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println "Extending GenericServlet makes your code simpler." ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;     }   }   The output from the SimpleServlet servlet is shown in Figure 2.5.   Figure 2.5. Extending GenericServlet.        Creating Thread-Safe Servlets   A servlet container allows multiple requests for the same servlet by creating a different thread to  service each request. In many cases, each thread deals with its own ServletRequest and  ServletResponse objects that are isolated from other threads. Problems start to arise, however,      29      when your servlet needs to access an external resource. To understand the problem introduced by  multithreaded servlets, consider the following "playing dog" illustration.   Imagine a servlet accessing an external resource as a dog who enjoys moving tennis balls from  one box to another. Each box can hold ten balls, no matter how the balls are arranged. The boxes  and the balls are an external resource to the dog. To play, the dog needs two boxes and ten balls.  Initially, those ten balls are placed in the first box. The dog moves all balls from the first box to  the second, one ball at a time. The dog is smart enough to count to ten. Therefore, it knows when  it's finished.   Now imagine a second thread of the same servlet as a second dog that plays the same game.  Because there are only two boxes and ten balls for both dogs, the two dogs share the same  "external resource." The game goes like this:   1.  The first dog starts first  the servlet receives a call from a user .  2.  After the first dog moves three balls, the second dog starts to play  the servlet is invoked   by the second user . What will happen?   The two dogs sharing the same balls are illustrated in Figure 2.6.   Figure 2.6. Understanding multi-threaded code.      The first dog and the second dog will not find enough balls to finish the game, and both will be  confused.   If somehow the second dog can be queued to wait to start until the first dog finishes, however, the  two dogs are happy.   That's what happens when two threads of the same servlet need to access an external resource,  such as opening a file and writing to it. Consider the following example, which reflects a real- world situation.   The code in Listing 2.13 presents a page counter servlet. What it does is simple. The servlet  overrides the service method to do the following:   1.  Open the counter.txt file using a BufferedReader, read the number into a counter, and   close the file.  Increment the counter.   2.  3.  Write the counter back to the counter.txt file.  4.  Display the counter in the web browser.      30      Imagine what happens if there are two users, Boni and Bulbul, who request the servlet. First Boni  requests it, and then a couple of nanoseconds after Boni, Bulbul requests the same servlet. The  scenario probably looks like this:   1.  The service method executes Steps 1 and 2, and then gets distracted by the other request.  2.  The method then does Step 1 from Bulbul before continuing to do Step 3 and 4 for Boni.   What happens next? Boni and Bulbul get the same number, which is not how it is supposed to be.  The servlet has produced an incorrect result. As you can see in Listing 2.13, the servlet is an  unsafe multithreaded servlet.   Listing 2.13 Unsafe Multi-Threaded Servlet   import javax.servlet.*;   import java.io.*;     public class SingleThreadedServlet extends GenericServlet     {      public void service ServletRequest request, ServletResponse  response        throws ServletException, IOException {      int counter = 0;            get saved value       try {        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader           new FileReader "counter.txt"  ;           counter = Integer.parseInt  reader.readLine    ;           reader.close  ;         }         catch  Exception e  {        }              increment counter         counter++;              save new value         try {          BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter             new FileWriter "counter.txt"  ;           writer.write Integer.toString counter  ;             writer.close  ;         }         catch  Exception e  {        }           try {          PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;           out.println "You are visitor number " + counter ;         }         catch  Exception e  {        }      }   }   To solve the problem, remember the solution to the "playing dog" illustration: When the second  dog waited until the first dog finished playing, both dogs could complete the game successfully.      31      This is exactly how you solve the problem in a servlet needing to service two users at the same  time: by making the second user wait until the first servlet finishes serving the first user. This  solution makes the servlet single-threaded.   This solution is very easy to do because of the marker SingleThreadedServlet interface. You don't  need to change your code; you need only to implement the interface.   The code in Listing 2.14 is the modification of the code in Listing 2.13. Nothing changes, except  that the SingleThreadedServlet class now implements SingleThreadModel, making it thread safe.   Listing 2.14 Safe Multi-Threaded Servlet   import javax.servlet.*;   import java.io.*;     public class SingleThreadedServlet extends GenericServlet     implements SingleThreadModel {      public void service ServletRequest request, ServletResponse  response        throws ServletException, IOException {      int counter = 0;            get saved value       try {        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader           new FileReader "counter.txt"  ;         counter = Integer.parseInt  reader.readLine    ;         reader.close  ;       }       catch  Exception e  {      }            increment counter       counter++;            save new value       try {        BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter           new FileWriter "counter.txt"  ;         writer.write Integer.toString counter  ;           writer.close  ;       }       catch  Exception e  {      }         try {        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;         out.println "You are visitor number " + counter ;       }       catch  Exception e  {      }     }   }   Now, if a user requests the service of the servlet while the servlet is servicing another user, the  user who comes later will have to wait.      32      If you want to experience erroneous multi-threading yourself, the code in Listing 2.15 provides the  SingleThreadedServlet with a delay of 6 seconds. Open two browsers and request the same servlet  quickly. Notice that you get the same number for both browsers.   Listing 2.15 Demonstrating an Unsafe Multi-Threaded Servlet     import javax.servlet.*;   import java.io.*;     public class SingleThreadedServlet extends GenericServlet {      public void service ServletRequest request, ServletResponse  response        throws ServletException, IOException {      int counter = 0;            get saved value       try {        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader           new FileReader "counter.txt"  ;         counter = Integer.parseInt  reader.readLine    ;         reader.close  ;       }       catch  Exception e  {      }            increment counter       counter++;            delay for 6 seconds to make observation possible       try {        Thread thread = new Thread  ;         thread.sleep 6000 ;       }       catch  InterruptedException e  {      }            saved new value       try {        BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter           new FileWriter "counter.txt"  ;         writer.write Integer.toString counter  ;           writer.close  ;       }       catch  Exception e  {      }         try {        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;         out.println "You are visitor number " + counter ;       }       catch  Exception e  {      }     }   }   Warning      33      The code in Listing 2.15 might give you an unexpected result because implementing the  SingleThreadModel interface only guarantees that no two threads will concurrently  execute the service    method within the same servlet instance. Since the servlet  container may instantiate multiple instances of a servlet class to handle a heavy request  load, the SingleThreadModel interface is left useless.   What the code does is simple: It opens the counter.txt file, reads the value, increments the value,  and writes the incremented value back to the file.   However, between the line of code that increments the value and the line of code that writes the  incremented value back to the user, we inserted the following code:   try {    Thread thread = new Thread  ;     thread.sleep 6000 ;   }   catch  InterruptedException e  {  }   Now you have time to request the same servlet from the second browser. The value shown in both  browsers will be the same if the second request comes before the first thread of the servlet has the  time to update the value in the counter.txt file.   An inexperienced programmer would wonder whether a good solution might be to make every  servlet implement the SingleThreadModel interface. The answer is no. If a servlet never accesses  an external resource, queuing the second request will create unnecessary delay to the subsequent  user after the first. Also, if the external resource is accessed but there is no need to update its value,  you don't need to implement the SingleThreadModel interface. For example, if the service method  of a servlet needs only to read a static value from a file, you can let multiple threads of the servlet  open and read the file at the same time.    Summary   This chapter introduced you to most of the interfaces and classes of the javax.servlet package, one  of the two packages provided for servlet programming. This package contains basic classes and  interfaces that are extended by members of the second package: javax.servlet.http. Understanding  the basic classes and interfaces in javax.servlet is important, even though you use them less often  than the javax.servlet.http package members in real-world applications. This chapter also showed  you how to implement the SingleThreadModel interface to solve the problem multi-threaded  servlets can have when accessing the same external resource.   The next chapter shows you how to write servlets that use the members of the second Servlet API  package, javax.servlet.http.      34      Chapter 3. Writing Servlet Applications   In the previous chapters, you have learned how to write servlets, run them in the servlet container,  and invoke them from a web browser. You also have studied various classes and interfaces in the  javax.servlet package and learned how to solve the problem introduced by a multi-threaded servlet.   When you are programming servlets, however, you will work with another package called  javax.servlet.http. The classes and interfaces in this package derive from those in javax.servlet;  however, the members of the javax.servlet.http package are much richer and more convenient to  use. In this package, the HttpServlet class represents a servlet, extending  javax.servlet.GenericServlet and bringing a great number of methods of its own. The  javax.servlet.http package also has interfaces that are equivalent to javax.servlet.ServletRequest  and javax.servlet.ServletResponse interfacesâthe HttpServletRequest and the  HttpServletResponse, respectively. It is not a coincidence that HttpServletRequest extends the  javax.servlet.ServletRequest interface, and HttpServletResponse is derived from the  javax.servlet.ServletResponse interface.   Additional classes exist that are not available in the javax.servlet package. For example, you can  use a class called Cookie to work with cookies. In addition, you will find session-related methods  in the HttpServlet class that enable you to deal with user sessions. Both cookies and sessions are  explained in detail in Chapter 5, "Session Management."   Let's now begin with an overview of the HttpServlet class, a class that you almost always extend  when developing servlets.    The HttpServlet Class   As mentioned previously, the HttpServlet class extends the javax.servlet.GenericServlet class. The  HttpServlet class also adds a number of interesting methods for you to use. The most important  are the six doxxx methods that get called when a related HTTP request method is used. The six  methods are doPost, doPut, doGet, doDelete, doOptions and doTrace. Each doxxx method is  invoked when a corresponding HTTP method is used. For instance, the doGet method is invoked  when the servlet receives an HTTP request that was sent using the GET method.   Note   If you are familiar with the HTTP 1.1 protocol, you will notice that the HEAD method  does not have a corresponding do method in the servlet. You are right. Actually, there is a  doHead method in the HttpServlet class, but it is a private method.   Of the six doxxx methods, the doPost and the doGet methods are the most frequently used.   The doPost method is called when the browser sends an HTTP request using the POST method.  The POST method is one of the two methods that can be used by an HTML form. Consider the  following HTML form at the client side:                          35   When the user clicks the Submit button to submit the form, the browser sends an HTTP request to  the server using the POST method. The web server then passes this request to the Register servlet  and the doPost method of the servlet is invoked. Using the POST method in a form, the parameter  name value pairs of the form are sent in the request body. For example, if you use the preceding  form as an example and enter Ann as the value for firstName and Go as the value for lastName,  you will get the following result in the request body:      firstName=Ann   lastName=Go   An HTML form can also use the GET method; however, POST is much more often used with  HTML forms.   The doGet method is invoked when an HTTP request is sent using the GET method. GET is the  default method in HTTP. When you type a URL, such as www.yahoo.com, your request is sent to  Yahoo! using the GET method. If you use the GET method in a form, the parameter name value  pairs are appended to the URL. Therefore, if you have two parameters named firstName and  lastName in your form, and the user enters Ann and Go, respectively, the URL to your servlet will  become something like the following:   http:  yourdomain myApp Register?firstName=Ann&lastName=Go   Upon receiving a GET method, the servlet will call its doGet method.   You may wonder how a servlet knows what doxxx method to invoke. You can find the  answer by reading the source code of the HttpServlet class. This class inherits the service  method from the javax.servlet.Servlet interface that gets called by the servlet container.  Remember that its signature is as follows:   public void service ServletRequest request,     ServletResponse response      throws ServletException, IOException   The method tries to downcast request to HttpRequest and response to HttpResponse, and pass both  as arguments to the second service method that has the following signature:   protected void service HttpServletRequest request,     HttpServletResponse response      throws ServletException, IOException   The HttpServletRequest interface has a method named getMethod that returns a String containing  the HTTP method used by the client request. Knowing the HTTP method, the service method  simply calls the corresponding doxxx method.   The servlet in Listing 3.1 demonstrates the doGet and the doPost methods.   Note   Note   If an HTML form does not have the ACTION attribute, the default value for this attribute  is the current page.   Listing 3.1 The doGet and doPost Methods      36      import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;     public class RegisterServlet extends HttpServlet {    public void doGet HttpServletRequest request,       HttpServletResponse response        throws ServletException, IOException {      response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " The GET method " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println "The servlet has received a GET. " +         "Now, click the button below." ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       }     public void doPost       HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response        throws ServletException, IOException {      response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " The POST method " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println "The servlet has received a POST. Thank you." ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;     }   }   When the servlet is first called from a web browser by typing the URL to the servlet in the  Address or Location box, GET is used as the request method. At the server side, the doGet method  is invoked. The servlet sends a string saying "The servlet has received a GET. Now, click the  button below." plus an HTML form. The output is shown in Figure 3.1.   Figure 3.1. The output of the doGet method.      37      The form sent to the browser uses the POST method. When the user clicks the button to submit  the form, a POST request is sent to the server. The servlet then invokes the doPost method,  sending a String saying, "The servlet has received a POST. Thank you," to the browser. The  output of doPost is shown in Figure 3.2.   Figure 3.2. The output of the doPost method.            38                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®         The HttpServletRequest Interface   In addition to providing several more protocol-specific methods in the HttpServlet class, the  javax.servlet.http package also provides more sophisticated request and response interfaces. The  request interface, HttpServletRequest, is described in this section. The response interface,  HttpServletResponse, is explained in the next section.   Obtaining HTTP Request Headers from HttpServletRequest   The HTTP request that a client browser sends to the server includes an HTTP request header with  important information, such as cookies and the referer. You can access these headers from the  HttpServletRequest object passed to a doxxx method.   Note   The list of all HTTP request headers is given in Chapter 13, "File Upload."   The following example demonstrates how you can use the HttpServletRequest interface to obtain  all the header names and sends the header name value pairs to the browser. The code is given in  Listing 3.2.   Listing 3.2 Obtaining HTTP request Headers   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;   import java.util.*;     public class RegisterServlet extends HttpServlet {    public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response  throws ServletException, IOException {        response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       Enumeration enumeration = request.getHeaderNames  ;       while  enumeration.hasMoreElements    {        String header =  String  enumeration.nextElement  ;         out.println header + ": " + request.getHeader header  + " " ;       }     }   }   The RegisterServlet in Listing 3.2 uses the getHeaderNames and the getHeader methods. The  getHeaderNames is first called to obtain an Enumeration containing all the header names found in  the client request. The value of each header then is retrieved by using the getHeader method,  passing a header name.   The output of the code in Listing 3.2 depends on the client environment, such as the browser used  and the operating system of the client's machine. For example, some browsers might send cookies  to the server. Also, whether the servlet is requested by the user typing the URL in the  Address Location box or by clicking a hyperlink also accounts for the presence of an HTTP  request header called referer.      39      The output of the code in Listing 3.2 is shown in Figure 3.3.   Figure 3.3. Obtaining HTTP request headers.      Some other methods of the HttpServletRequest interface provide information about paths. The  getPathInfo method returnsâfollowing the servlet path but preceding the query stringâa String  containing any additional path information, or returns null if there is no additional path  information. The getPathTranslated method returns the same information as the getPathInfo  method, but translates the path to its physical path name before returning it, or returns null if there  is no additional path information. Additional information comes after the servlet name and before  the query string. The servlet name and the additional information is separated by the forward slash  character    .   For example, consider a request to a servlet called PathInfoDemoServlet, made with the following  URL:   http:  localhost:8080 myApp servlet PathInfoDemoServlet AddInfo?id=2   This URL contains additional info " AddInfo" after the servlet name. The getPathInfo method will  return the String " AddInfo", the getQueryString method will return "id=2", and the  getPathTranslated method returns "C:\App\Java\AddInfo". The return value of getPathTranslated  depends on the location of the servlet class file.   Next, the getRequestURI method returns the first line of the request's Uniform Resource Identifier   URI . This is the part of the URI that is found to the left of the query string. The getServletPath  method returns the part of the URI that refers to the servlet being invoked. Figure 3.4 shows the  path information of a servlet called HttpRequestDemoServlet.   Figure 3.4. The path information of HttpRequestDemoServlet.      40         Obtaining the Query String from HttpServletRequest   The next important method is the getQueryString method, which is used to retrieve the query  string of the HTTP request. A query string is the string on the URL to the right of the path to the  servlet. The following example helps you see what a query string looks like.   As mentioned previously, if you use the GET method in an HTML form, the parameter  name value pairs will be appended to the URL. The code in Listing 3.3 is a servlet named  HttpRequestDemoServlet that displays the value of the request's query string and a form.   Listing 3.3 Obtaining the Query String   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;   import java.util.*;     public class HttpRequestDemoServlet extends HttpServlet {    public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response        throws ServletException, IOException {        response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Obtaining the Query String " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println "Query String: " + request.getQueryString   + " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " First Name:  " ;       out.println " Last Name:  " ;       out.println "  " ;       41          out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;     }   }   When the user enters the URL to the servlet in the web browser and the servlet is first called, the  query string is null, as shown in Figure 3.5.   Figure 3.5. The query string is null.   After you enter some values into the HTML form and submit the form, the page is redisplayed.  Note that now there is a string added to the URL. The query string has a value of the parameter  name value pairs separated by an ampersand  & . The page is shown in Figure 3.6.   Figure 3.6. The query string with a non-null value.         42         Obtaining the Parameters from HttpServletRequest   You have seen that you can get the query string containing a value. This means that you can get  the form parameter name value pairs or other values from the previous page. You should not use  the getQueryString method to obtain a form's parameter name value pairs, however, because this  means you have to parse the string yourself. You can use some other methods in  HttpServletRequest to get the parameter names and values: the getParameterNames and the  getParameter methods.   The getParameterNames method returns an Enumeration containing the parameter names. In many  cases, however, you already know the parameter names, so you don't need to use this method. To  get a parameter value, you use the getParameter method, passing the parameter name as the  argument.   The following example demonstrates how you can use the getParameterNames and the  getParameter methods to display all the parameter names and values from the HTML form from  the previous page. The code is given in Listing 3.4.   Listing 3.4 Obtaining the Parameter Name Value Pairs   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;   import java.util.*;     public class HttpRequestDemoServlet extends HttpServlet {    public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response  throws ServletException, IOException {        response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       43          out.println " Obtaining the Parameter " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println "The request's parameters are: " ;         Enumeration enumeration = request.getParameterNames  ;       while  enumeration.hasMoreElements   {        String parameterName =  String  enumeration.nextElement  ;         out.println parameterName + ": " +           request.getParameter parameterName  + " "  ;       }         out.println " " ;       out.println " First Name:  " ;       out.println " Last Name:  " ;       out.println "  " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;     }   }   When the servlet is first called, it does not have any parameter from the previous request.  Therefore, the no parameter name value pair is displayed, as shown in Figure 3.7.   Figure 3.7. The first request does not have a parameter.   On subsequent requests, the user should enter values for both the firstName and lastName  parameters. This is reflected on the next page, which is shown in Figure 3.8.   Figure 3.8. The parameter name value pairs.         44         The code in Listing 3.4 also can be used without any modification if the form uses the POST  method, which is what you normally use for a form. There are numerous cases, however, where  you need to pass non-form values in the URL. This technique is reviewed in Chapter 5.   Manipulating Multi-Value Parameters   You may have a need to use parameters with the same name in your form. This case might arise,  for example, when you are using check box controls that can accept multiple values or when you  have a multiple-selection HTML select control. In situations like these, you can't use the  getParameter method because it will give you only the first value. Instead, you use the  getParameterValues method.   The getParameterValues method accepts one argument: the parameter name. It returns an array of  string containing all the values for that parameter. If the parameter of that name is not found, the  getParameterValues method will return a null.   The following example illustrates the use of the getParameterValues method to get all favorite  music selected by the user. The code for this servlet is given in Listing 3.5.   Listing 3.5 Obtaining Multiple Values from a Parameter   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;   import java.util.*;     public class HttpRequestDemoServlet extends HttpServlet {    public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response  throws ServletException, IOException {        response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       45          out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Obtaining Multi-Value Parameters " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;         out.println " " ;       out.println " Select your favorite music:" ;       out.println "  " ;       out.println " <INPUT TYPE=CHECKBOX " +         "NAME=favoriteMusic VALUE=Rock>Rock" ;       out.println " <INPUT TYPE=CHECKBOX " +         "NAME=favoriteMusic VALUE=Jazz>Jazz" ;       out.println " <INPUT TYPE=CHECKBOX " +         "NAME=favoriteMusic VALUE=Classical>Classical" ;       out.println " <INPUT TYPE=CHECKBOX " +         "NAME=favoriteMusic VALUE=Country>Country" ;       out.println "  " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;     }       public void doPost HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse   response  throws ServletException, IOException {        String[] values = request.getParameterValues "favoriteMusic" ;       response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       if  values != null   {        int length = values.length;         out.println "You have selected: " ;         for  int i=0; i<length; i++  {          out.println " " + values[i] ;         }       }     }   }   When the servlet is first called, the doGet method is invoked and the method sends a form to the  web browser. The form has four check box controls with the same name: favoriteMusic. Their  values are different, however. This is shown in Figure 3.9.   Figure 3.9. A form with multiple value check boxes.      46      When the user selects the value s  of the check boxes, the browser sends all selected values. In the  server side, you use the getParameterValues to retrieve all values sent in the request. This is  shown in Figure 3.10   Figure 3.10. Displaying the selected values.   Note that you use the POST method for the form; therefore, the parameter name value pairs are  retrieved in the doPost method.      47              HttpServletResponse   The HttpServletResponse interface provides several protocol-specific methods not available in the  javax.servlet.ServletResponse interface.   The HttpServletResponse interface extends the javax.servlet.ServletResponse interface. In the  examples in this chapter so far, you have seen that you always use two of the methods in  HttpServletResponse when sending output to the browser: setContentType and getWriter.   response.setContentType "text html" ;   PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;   There is more to it, however. The addCookie method sends cookies to the browser. You also use  methods to manipulate the URLs sent to the browser. These methods are explored further in the  section on user session management in Chapter 5.   Another interesting method in the HttpServletResponse interface is the setHeader method. This  method allows you to add a name value field to the response header.   You can also use a method to redirect the user to another page: sendRedirect. When you call this  method, the web server sends a special message to the browser to request another page. Therefore,  there is always a round trip to the client side before the other page is fetched. This method is used  frequently and its use is illustrated in the following example. Listing 3.6 shows a Login page that  prompts the user to enter a user name and a password. If both are correct, the user will be  redirected to a Welcome page. If not, the user will see the same Login page.   When the servlet is first requested, the servlet's doGet method is called. The doGet method then  outputs the form. The user can then enter the user name and password, and submit the form. Note  that the form uses the POST method, which means that at the server side, the doPost method is  invoked and the user name and password are checked against some predefined values. If the user  name and password match, the user is redirected to a Welcome page. If not, the doPost method  outputs the Login form again along with an error message.   Listing 3.6 A Login Page   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;   import java.util.*;     public class LoginServlet extends HttpServlet {      private void sendLoginForm HttpServletResponse response,       boolean withErrorMessage        throws ServletException, IOException {      response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Login " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;         if  withErrorMessage        48                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®             out.println "Login failed.

" ;         out.println " " ;       out.println " Please enter your user name and password." ;         out.println "  " ;       out.println " User Name:  " ;       out.println " Password:  " ;       out.println "  " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       }     public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response  throws ServletException, IOException {      sendLoginForm response, false ;     }       public void doPost HttpServletRequest request,       HttpServletResponse response        throws ServletException, IOException {      String userName = request.getParameter "userName" ;       String password = request.getParameter "password" ;       if  userName != null && password != null &&         userName.equals "jamesb"  && password.equals "007"   {        response.sendRedirect "http:  domain app WelcomePage" ;       }       else {        sendLoginForm response, true ;       }     }   }   Note   Note that if you are redirecting to a resource in the same application, you don't need to  specify the complete URL; that is, you can just write, in the previous example,  response.sendRedirect  " app WelcomePage" . For efficiency, however, you don't  normally use the sendRedirect method to redirect a user to another resource in the same  application. Instead, you forward the user, as you will see in the section, "Request  Dispatching," later in this chapter.   In the code in Listing 3.6, I wrote a private method called sendLoginForm that accepts an  HttpServletResponse object and a boolean that signals whether an error message be sent along  with the form. This sendLoginForm method is called both from the doGet and the doPost methods.  When called from the doGet method, no error message is given, because this is the first time the  user requests the page. The withErrorMessage flag is therefore false. When called from the doPost  method, this flag is set to true because the sendLoginForm method is only invoked from doPost if  the user name and password did not match.   The Login page, when it is first requested, is shown in Figure 3.11. The Login page, after a failed  attempt to log in, is shown in Figure 3.12.   Figure 3.11. The Login page when first requested.      49      Figure 3.12. The Login page after a failed login.         After seeing the example, an experienced reader may ask, "If we can go to the Welcome page by  just typing its URL in the web browser, why do we have to log in?"   This is true. The user can bypass the Login page, and this issue has to do with session  management and will be addressed in Chapter 5.      50        Sending an Error Code   The HttpServletResponse also allows you to send pre-defined error messages. The interface  defines a number of public static final integers that all start with SC_. For example,  SC_FORBIDDEN will be translated into an HTTP error 403.   Along with the error code, you also can send a custom error message. Instead of redisplaying the  Login page when a failed login occurs, you can send an HTTP error 403 plus your error message.  To do this, replace the call to the sendLoginForm in the doPost method with the following:   response.sendError response.SC_FORBIDDEN, "Login failed." ;   The user will see the screen in Figure 3.13 when a login fails.   Figure 3.13. Sending an HTTP Error 403.   Note   The complete list of status codes can be found in Appendix C, "The javax.servlet.http  Package Reference."        Sending Special Characters      51      Several characters have a special meaning in HTML. For instance, the less-than character  <  is  used as the opening character of an HTML tag, and the greater-than character  >  is the closing  character of an HTML tag.   When sending these characters to be displayed in the browser, you need to encode them so that  they will be rendered correctly. For example, consider the code in Listing 3.7.   The doGet method of the SpecialCharacterServlet is very simple. It is intended to send a string  that will be rendered as the following text in the browser:   In HTML, you use   to change line.   Listing 3.7 Incorrect Rendering of Special Characters   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;   import java.util.*;     public class SpecialCharacterServlet extends HttpServlet {    public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response      throws ServletException, IOException {        response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " HTML Tutorial â Changing Line " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println "In HTML, you use   to change line." ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;     }   }   This code produces a problem, however. To see what went wrong, take a look at the output of the  doGet method in a browser, as shown in Figure 3.14.   Figure 3.14. Special characters are not displayed correctly.      52         Because   means change line in HTML, the intended string is not displayed correctly. Instead,  it was interpreted as a command to cut the original string into two and the output was displayed in  two lines.   To get around this, every time you want to display a special character, you need to encode it. The  less-than character     as ">". Other special  characters are the ampersand  &  and double quotation mark  "  characters. You replace the  ampersand  &  with "&amp;" and the double quotation marks  "  with "&quot;". Additionally, two  or more white spaces are always displayed as a single space, unless you convert each individual  space to "&nbsp;".   Converting every occurrence of a special character is a tedious task, however. That's why you  need a function that will do it automatically. Such a function is called encodeHtmlTag and is  given in Listing 3.8. Now, if you suspect that the String you want to send to the browser contains a  special character, just pass it to the encodeHtmlTag function.   Listing 3.8 The encodeHtmlTag Function   public static String encodeHtmlTag String tag  {      if  tag == null          return null;       int length = tag.length  ;       StringBuffer encodedTag = new StringBuffer 2 * length ;       for  int i=0; i<length; i++  {        char c = tag.charAt i ;         if  c == '<'            encodedTag.append "<" ;         else if  c == '>'            encodedTag.append ">" ;         else if  c == '&'            encodedTag.append "&amp;" ;         else if  c == '"'            encodedTag.append "&quot;" ;       53            else if  c == ' '            encodedTag.append "&nbsp;" ;         else           encodedTag.append c ;         }       return encodedTag.toString  ;   }   Listing 3.9 demonstrates a servlet that includes the encodeHtmlTag method and uses it to encode  any String with special characters.   Listing 3.9 Using the encodeHtmlTag Method in a Servlet   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;   import java.util.*;     public class SpecialCharacterServlet extends HttpServlet {    public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response      throws ServletException, IOException {        response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " HTML Tutorial â Changing Line " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println encodeHtmlTag "In HTML, you use   to change  line."  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       }        **      * Encode an HTML tag so it will be displayed      * as it is on the browser.      * Particularly, this method searches the      * passed in String and replace every occurrence      * of the following character:      * '<' with "&lt;"      * '>' with "&gt;"      * '&' with "&amp;"      *   '"' with "&quot;"      * ' ' with "&nbsp;"      *      public static String encodeHtmlTag String tag  {      if  tag == null          return null;       int length = tag.length  ;       StringBuffer encodedTag = new StringBuffer 2 * length ;       for  int i=0; i<length; i++  {        char c = tag.charAt i ;         if  c == '<'            encodedTag.append "&lt;" ;         else if  c == '>'            encodedTag.append "&gt;" ;       54            else if  c == '&'            encodedTag.append "&amp;" ;         else if  c == '"'            encodedTag.append "&quot;" ;    when trying to output text as              tag's value as in values="???".         else if  c == ' '            encodedTag.append "&nbsp;" ;         else           encodedTag.append c ;         }       return encodedTag.toString  ;     }   }   Figure 3.15 shows the output of sending the string, "In HTML, you use   to change line". If  you look at the HTML source code, you will notice that the < character has been converted to <  and the > character to >.   Figure 3.15. Encoding special characters.        Buffering the Response   If response buffering is enabled, the output to the browser is not sent until the servlet processing is  finished or the buffer is full. Buffering enhances the performance of your servlet because the  servlet needs to send the string output only once, instead of sending it every time the print or  println method of the PrintWriter object is called. By default, buffering is enabled and the buffer  size is 8,192 characters. You can change this value by using the HttpServletResponse interface's  setBufferSize method. This method can be called only before any output is sent.      55        Populating HTML Elements   One of the tasks that you will perform often is populating the values of HTML elements. This is a  straightforward task that can be tricky if you are not cautious. To do it correctly, pay attention to  the following two rules:   1.  Always enclose a value with double quotation marks  " . This way, white spaces will be   rendered correctly.  If the value contains a double quotation mark character, you need to encode the double  quotation marks  " .   2.   The servlet in Listing 3.10 contains an HTML form with two elements: a Textbox and a Password  box. The Textbox element is given the value, Duncan "The Great" Young, and the password is  lo&&lita.   Listing 3.10 Populating HTML Elements   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;   import java.util.*;     public class PopulateValueServlet extends HttpServlet {    public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response  throws ServletException, IOException {        String userName = "Duncan \"The Great\" Young";       String password = "lo&&lita";       response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Populate HTML elements " ;       out.println " " ;         out.println " Your user name and password. " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " User name: <INPUT TYPE=TEXT NAME=userName  VALUE=\"" + userName + "\">" ;       out.println " Password: <INPUT TYPE=PASSWORD NAME=password  VALUE=\"" + password + "\">" ;         out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;     }   }   As you can see in Figure 3.16, however, the value in the Textbox element is truncated because the  first double quotation mark characterâin "The Great"âfools the browser into thinking that it is  the end of the value. To overcome this problem, use the encodeHtmlTag method.   Figure 3.16. Truncated value.      56           Request Dispatching   In some circumstances, you may want to include the content from an HTML page or the output  from another servlet. Additionally, there are cases that require that you pass the processing of an  HTTP request from your servlet to another servlet. The current servlet specification responds to  these needs with an interface called RequestDispatcher, which is found in the javax.servlet  package. This interface has two methods, which allow you to delegate the request-response  processing to another resource: include and forward. Both methods accept a  javax.servlet.ServletRequest object and a javax.servlet.ServletResponse object as arguments.   As the name implies, the include method is used to include content from another resource, such as  another servlet, a JSP page, or an HTML page. The method has the following signature:   public void include javax.servlet.ServletRequest request,     javax.servlet.ServletResponse response      throws javax.servlet.ServletException, java.io.IOException   The forward method is used to forward a request from one servlet to another. The original servlet  can perform some initial tasks on the ServletRequest object before forwarding it. The signature of  the forward method is as follows:   public void forward javax.servlet.ServletRequest request,     javax.servlet.ServletResponse response      throws javax.servlet.ServletException, java.io.IOException     The Difference Between sendRedirect and forward   Both the sendRedirect and forward methods bring the user to a new resource. There is a      57      or      fundamental difference between the two, however, and understanding this can help you  write a more efficient servlet.   The sendRedirect method works by sending a status code that tells the browser to  request another URL. This means that there is always a round trip to the client side.  Additionally, the previous HttpServletRequest object is lost. To pass information  between the original servlet and the next request, you normally pass the information as a  query string appended to the destination URL.   The forward method, on the other hand, redirects the request without the help from the  client's browser. Both the HttpServletRequest object and the HttpServletResponse object  also are passed to the new resource.   To perform a servlet include or forward, you first need to obtain a RequestDispatcher object. You  can obtain a RequestDispatcher object three different ways, as follows:      Use the getRequestDispatcher method of the javax.servlet.ServletContext interface,   passing a String containing the path to the other resource. The path is relative to the root  of the ServletContext.      Use the getRequestDispatcher method of the javax.servlet.ServletRequest interface,  passing a String containing the path to the other resource. The path is relative to the  current HTTP request.      Use the getNamedDispatcher method of the javax.servlet.ServletContext interface,   passing a String containing the name of the other resource.   When programmers new to servlet programming are writing code for request dispatching, they  often make the common mistake of passing an incorrect path to the getRequestDispatcher method.  A big difference exists between the getRequestDispatcher method of the ServletContext interface  and that belonging to the ServletRequest interface. The one you use depends on the location of the  resource to be included or forwarded to. If you use the getRequestDispatcher method of the  javax.servlet.ServletContext interface, you pass a path that is relative to the root of the  ServletContext. If you use the getRequestDispatcher method of the javax.servlet.ServletRequest  interface, you pass a path that is relative to the current HTTP request.   When you are creating a RequestDispatcher object from a servlet named FirstServlet to include or  forward the request to another servlet called SecondServlet, the easiest way is to place the class  files of both FirstServlet and SecondServlet in the same directory. This way, FirstServlet can be  invoked from the URL http:  domain VirtualDir servlet FirstServlet and SecondServlet can be  called from the URL http:  domain VirtualDir servlet SecondServlet. You then can use the  getRequestDispatcher from the ServletRequest interface, passing the name of the second servlet.  In FirstServlet, you can write the following code:   public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response  throws ServletException, IOException {      RequestDispatcher rd =  request.getRequestDispatcher "SecondServlet" ;     rd.include request, response ;   }   public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response  throws ServletException, IOException {     58                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       or   or     RequestDispatcher rd =  request.getRequestDispatcher "SecondServlet" ;     rd.forward request, response ;   }   Because both FirstServlet and SecondServlet are in the same directory, you don't need to include  the forward slash     character before SecondServlet. In this case, you don't need to worry about  the paths of both servlets.   Another option is to do it the harder way by passing the following String to the  getRequestDispatcher of ServletRequest:   " servlet SecondServlet"   If you are to use the getRequestDispatcher from the ServletContext, you must pass  " VirtualDir servlet SecondServlet" as the path argument, such as the following:   public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response      throws ServletException, IOException {      RequestDispatcher rd =        getServletContext  .getRequestDispatcher " servlet SecondServlet" ;     rd.include request, response ;   }   public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response      throws ServletException, IOException {    RequestDispatcher rd =        getServletContext  .getRequestDispatcher " servlet SecondServlet" ;     rd.forward request, response ;   }   To use the getNamedDispatcher method, your code would become   public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response      throws ServletException, IOException {      RequestDispatcher rd =       getServletContext  .getNamedDispatcher "SecondServlet" ;     rd.include request, response ;   }   public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response      throws ServletException, IOException {      RequestDispatcher rd =       getServletContext  .getNamedDispatcher "SecondServlet" ;     rd.forward request, response ;       59      }   Of course, when you use the getNamedDispatcher method, you must register the second servlet in  your deployment descriptor. Here is an example:       <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                    FirstServlet         FirstServlet                     SecondServlet         SecondServlet              If you are including from a doPost method, the doPost method of the second servlet will be  invoked. If including from a doGet method, the doGet method of the second servlet will be called.   If you change the resource included in your servlet, you need to restart Tomcat for the  change to take effect. This is required because the included servlet is never invoked  directly. After the included servlet is loaded, its timestamp is never compared again.   The following sections give you a closer look at the use of the RequestDispatcher interface.   Warning   Note   Note that in the olden days  which are not so long ago, of course , servlet chaining was  the technique used to perform what RequestDispatcher can do. Servlet chaining is not part  of the J2EE specification, however, and its use is dependent on specific servlet containers.  You may still find this term in old literature on servlets.   Including Other Resources   On many occasions, you may want to include other resources inside your servlet. For example,  you may have a collection of JavaScript functions that you want to include in the response to the  user. Separating non-servlet content makes sure that modularity is maintained. In this case, a  JavaScript programmer can work independently of the servlet programmer. The page containing  the JavaScript functions can then be included using the include method of a RequestDispatcher.   Another time you may want to include other resources in your servlet might be when you want to  include the output of a servlet whose output is a link to a randomly selected advertisement banner.  By separating into a separate servlet the code that selects the banner, the same code can be  included in more than one servlet, and formatting can be done by modifying the included servlet  solely.   The include method of the RequestDispatcher interface may be called at any time. The target  servlet has access to all aspects of the request object, but can only write information to the  ServletOutputStream or Writer object of the response object. The target servlet also can commit a      60      response by either writing content past the end of the response buffer or explicitly calling the flush  method of the ServletResponse interface. The included servlet cannot set headers or call any  method that affects the header of the response.   When a servlet is being called from within an include method, it is sometimes necessary for that  servlet to know the path by which it was invoked. The following request attributes are set and  accessible from the included servlet via the getAttribute method on the request object:                   javax.servlet.include.request_uri  javax.servlet.include.context_path  javax.servlet.include.servlet_path  javax.servlet.include.path_info  javax.servlet.include.query_string   These attributes are not set if the included servlet was obtained by using the getNamedDispatcher  method.   Including Static Content   Sometimes you need to include static content, such as HTML pages or image files that are  prepared by a web graphic designer. You can do this by using the same technique for including  dynamic resources that you've been reading about in this chapter.   The following example shows a servlet named FirstServlet that includes an HTML file named  AdBanner.html. The servlet class file is located in the WEB-INF\classes directory, whereas the  AdBanner.html file, like other HTML files, resides in the application directory. In other words,  using the myApp application, the AdBanner.html file resides in the myApp directory, whereas the  servlet class file is in myApp WEB-INF classes directory. The servlet is given in Listing 3.11 and  the HTML file is given in Listing 3.12.   Listing 3.11 Including Static Content   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;   import java.util.*;     public class FirstServlet extends HttpServlet {      public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response  throws ServletException, IOException {        RequestDispatcher rd =  request.getRequestDispatcher " AdBanner.html" ;         rd.include request, response ;     }   }   Listing 3.12 The AdBanner.html File            Banner                    61              Including Another Servlet   The second example shows a servlet  FirstServlet  that includes another servlet  SecondServlet .  The second servlet simply sends the included request parameter to the user. The FirstServlet is  given in Listing 3.13 and the SecondServlet is presented in Listing 3.14. The output of the  example is given in Figure 3.17.   Figure 3.17. The included request parameters.      Listing 3.13 FirstServlet   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;   public class FirstServlet extends HttpServlet {      public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response  throws ServletException, IOException {        response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Included Request Parameters " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Included Request Parameters  " ;       RequestDispatcher rd =          request.getRequestDispatcher " servlet SecondServlet?name=budi" ;       62          rd.include request, response ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;     }   }   Listing 3.14 SecondServlet   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;   import java.util.*;     public class SecondServlet extends HttpServlet {      public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response  throws ServletException, IOException {      response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       Enumeration enum = request.getAttributeNames  ;       while  enum.hasMoreElements    {        String attributeName =  String  enum.nextElement  ;         out.println attributeName + ": " +           request.getAttribute attributeName  + " " ;       }     }   }   Forwarding Processing Control   Unlike the include method, the forward method of the RequestDispatcher interface may be called  only by the calling servlet if no output has been committed to the client. If output exists in the  response buffer that has not been committed, the buffer must be cleared before the target servlet's  service method is called. If the response has been committed prior to calling the forward method,  an IllegalStateException will be thrown. For example, the servlet in Listing 3.15 will raise an error  because the flushBuffer method is called before the forward method.   Listing 3.15 Forwarding Control After the Buffer Is Flushed   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;     public class FirstServlet extends HttpServlet {    public void doGet HttpServletRequest request,     HttpServletResponse response      throws ServletException, IOException {        response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Included Request Parameters " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Included Request Parameters  " ;       response.flushBuffer  ;       RequestDispatcher rd =         request.getRequestDispatcher " servlet SecondServlet" ;       63          rd.forward request, response ;       out.println "asdfaf " ;       out.println " " ;     }   }   The forward method also can be used to forward the request to a static content. Again, the  flushBuffer method must not be called beforehand.   The forward method is also a good replacement for the sendRedirect method of the  HttpServletResponse interface. You may recall that with the sendRedirect method there is a round  trip to the client. If you are redirecting the user to a servlet or a page in the current application, you  can use the forward method instead. There is no round trip to the browser when using the forward  method; therefore, this gives the user a faster response.   The following example rewrites the Login servlet from Listing 3.6. Instead of using the  sendRedirect method, the servlet uses a RequestDispatcher to forward the request to the  WelcomeServlet servlet when the login was successful. The code for the modified Login servlet is  given in Listing 3.16 and the code for the WelcomeServlet servlet is shown in Listing 3.17.   Listing 3.16 The LoginServlet Servlet   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;   import java.util.*;     public class LoginServlet extends HttpServlet {    private void sendLoginForm HttpServletResponse response,       boolean withErrorMessage        throws ServletException, IOException {      response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Login " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;         if  withErrorMessage          out.println "Login failed.

" ;         out.println " " ;       out.println " Please enter your user name and password." ;       out.println "  " ;       out.println " User Name:  " ;       out.println " Password:  " ;       out.println "  " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       }       public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response  throws ServletException, IOException {      sendLoginForm response, false ;     }         64        public void doPost HttpServletRequest request,       HttpServletResponse response  throws ServletException,  IOException {      String userName = request.getParameter "userName" ;       String password = request.getParameter "password" ;       if  userName != null && password != null &&         userName.equals "jamesb"  && password.equals "007"   {        RequestDispatcher rd =  request.getRequestDispatcher "WelcomeServlet" ;         rd.forward request, response ;       }       else {        sendLoginForm response, true ;       }     }   }   Listing 3.17 The WelcomeServlet Servlet   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;     public class WelcomeServlet extends HttpServlet {    public void doPost HttpServletRequest request,       HttpServletResponse response  throws ServletException,  IOException {      response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Welcome " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Welcome to the Bulbul's and Boni's Web  Site. " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;     }   }     If a request is dispatched from doGet, the doGet method of the destination servlet will be  invoked. If it is from doPost, the doPost method of the destination servlet will be  invoked.   Note     Summary   In this chapter, you have learned how to use some of the classes and interfaces from the  javax.servlet.http package. You have been shown a number of examples that demonstrate the use  of HttpServlet, HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse.      65      In addition, this chapter introduced you to the RequestDispatcher interface. This interface is useful  for including other resources and forwarding the request to another resource.   The next chapter discusses database access using the Java Database Connectivity  JDBC   technology. This is an important chapter considering that almost all non-trivial web applications  involve accessing data in a database.      66      Chapter 4. Accessing Databases with JDBC   Most web applications use a database. Database accessing and programming therefore play a  significant role in web development. In this chapter, you examine how data can be stored,  retrieved, and manipulated. In Java, the technology that enables database access and manipulation  is called Java Database Connectivity  JDBC .   JDBC has two parts: the JDBC Core Application Programming Interface  API  and the JDBC  Optional Package API. The JDBC Core API is the main part of JDBC and when people talk about  JDBC, they often are referring to this part.   The JDBC Core API is part of the Java 2, Standard Edition  J2SE  and takes the form of the  classes and interfaces in the java.sql package. At the time of writing, the most recent version is 3.0.  You use the members of the java.sql package primarily for basic database programming.   The JDBC Optional Package API is specified in the javax.sql package and is currently in version  2.0. The javax.sql package supports connection pooling, distributed transactions, rowsets, and so  on. Of these, connection pooling is the most important in servlet programming; it is therefore  explored in this chapter. You can download this package from  http:  java.sun.com products jdbc download.html.   JDBC is a broad topic, and a complete discussion of its object model requires a book of its own.  This chapter starts with a look at the object model in the java.sql package, but does not attempt to  explain JDBC thoroughly. Some of the features in JDBC do not even suit our needs in web  programming. For example, JDBC supports cursors that can scroll back, but using this type of  cursor in a servlet is not tolerable for efficiency reasons. If you want to know more about JDBC,  refer to the JDBC web site, http:  java.sun.com products jdbc index.html.   With the exception of the section, "Connection Pooling," toward the end of this chapter, the  examples use the interfaces and classes of the java.sql package. A discussion of this package at the  beginning of this chapter provides the uninitiated reader with enough JDBC knowledge to build  database-enabling servlets. However, the discussion assumes familiarity with Structured Query  Language  SQL . After the initial discussion, this chapter provides an easy passage to database  programming in servlets in the section, "Four Steps to Getting to the Database."  If you are  already a JDBC expert, you may want to skip that section.     The java.sql Package   The java.sql package provides the API for accessing and processing data in a data source. The  most important members of the java.sql package are as follows:      The DriverManager class     The Driver interface     The Connection interface     The Statement interface     The ResultSet interface     The PreparedStatement interface     The ResultSetMetaData interface   Each of the types is briefly discussed in the following sections.      67      The DriverManager Class   The DriverManager class provides static methods for managing JDBC drivers. Each JDBC driver  you want to use must be registered with the DriverManager. The JDBC driver of the database to  which you want to connect is supplied either by the database vendor or a third party. You use  different JDBC drivers for different database servers. For example, the JDBC driver for Microsoft  SQL Server is different from the one used to access Oracle databases. JDBC drivers are discussed  in more detail in the section, "Four Steps to Getting to the Database."   To load a JDBC driver from a servlet or JSP page, you copy the JDBC driver file for a particular  database server  normally a .jar file  to the WEB-INF\lib directory under your application  directory. Create the lib directory, if it doesn't exist, and then use the following code:   try {    Class.forName "JDBC.driver" ;   }   catch  ClassNotFoundException e  {       driver not found   }   In this case, JDBC.driver is the fully qualified name of the JDBC driver class. This name can be  found in the documentation accompanying the JDBC driver.   The DriverManager class's most important method is getConnection that returns a  java.sql.Connection object. This method has three overloads whose signatures are as follows:   public static Connection getConnection String url    public static Connection getConnection String url, Properties info    public static Connection getConnection String url, String user,  String   password    The Driver Interface   The Driver interface is implemented by every JDBC driver class. The driver class itself is loaded  and registered with the DriverManager, and the DriverManager can manage multiple drivers for  any given connection request. In the case where there are multiple drivers registered, the  DriverManager will ask each driver in turn to try to connect to the target URL.   The Connection Interface   The Connection interface represents a connection to the database. An instance of the Connection  interface is obtained from the getConnection method of the DriverManager class.   close   isClosed   The close method immediately closes and releases a Connection object instead of waiting for it to  be released automatically. Its signature is as follows:   public void close   throws SQLException   You use this method to test whether the Connection object is closed. The signature of this method  is as follows:      68                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       createStatement   public boolean isClosed   throws SQLException   The createStatement method is used to create a Statement object for sending SQL statements to  the database. If the same SQL statement is executed many times, it is more efficient to use a  PreparedStatement object.   This method has two overloads with the following signatures:   public Statement createStatement   throws SQLException   public Statement createStatement    int resultSetType,   int resultSetConcurrency  throws SQLException   prepareStatement   getAutoCommit   You use the prepareStatement method to create a PreparedStatement object. Its signature is as  follows:   public PreparedStatement prepareStatement  throws SQLException   The getAutoCommit method returns a boolean specifying the current auto-commit state. The  signature of this method is as follows:   public boolean getAutoCommit   throws SQLException   This method returns true if auto-commit is enabled and false if auto-commit is not enabled. By  default, auto-commit is enabled.   setAutoCommit   The setAutoCommit method sets the auto-commit state of the Connection object. Its signature is  as follows:   public void setAutoCommit boolean autocommit  throws SQLException   You use the commit method to commit a transaction. The signature of this method is as follows:   public void commit   throws SQLException   commit   rollback   You use the rollback method to roll back a transaction. Its signature is as follows:   public void rollback   throws SQLException   The Statement Interface      69      executeQuery   executeUpdate   You use the statement interface method to execute an SQL statement and obtain the results that  are produced. The two most important methods of this interface are executeQuery and  executeUpdate.   The executeQuery method executes an SQL statement that returns a single ResultSet object. Its  signature is as follows:   public ResultSet executeQuery String sql  throws SQLException   The executeUpdate method executes an insert, update, and delete SQL statement. The method  returns the number of records affected by the SQL statement execution, and its signature is as  follows:   public int executeUpdate String sql    The ResultSet Interface   The ResultSet interface represents a table-like database result set. A ResultSet object maintains a  cursor pointing to its current row of data. Initially, the cursor is positioned before the first row.  The following are some important methods of the ResultSet interface.   isFirst   isLast   next   The isFirst method indicates whether the cursor points to the first record in the ResultSet. Its  signature is as follows:   public boolean isFirst   throws SQLException   The isLast method indicates whether the cursor points to the last record in the ResultSet. Its  signature is as follows:   public boolean isLast   throws SQLException   The next method moves the cursor to the next record, returning true if the current row is valid and  false if there are no more records in the ResultSet object. The method's signature is as follows:   public boolean next   throws SQLException   getMetaData   The getMetaData method returns the ResultSetMetaData object representing the meta data of the  ResultSet. The signature of the method is as follows:   public ResultSetMetaData getMetaDate   throws SQLException      70      In addition to the previous methods, you can use several getXXX methods to obtain the value of  the specified column in the row pointed by the cursor. In this case, XXX represents the data type  returned by the method at the specified index, and each getXXX method accepts the index position  of the column in the ResultSet. The column index 1 indicates the first column. The signature of  this method is as follows:   public XXX getXXX int columnIndex  throws SQLException   For example, the getString method has the following signature and returns the specified cell as  String:   public String getString int columnIndex  throws SQLException   The PreparedStatement Interface   The PreparedStatement interface extends the Statement interface and represents a precompiled  SQL statement. You use an instance of this interface to execute efficiently an SQL statement  multiple times.   The ResultSetMetaData Interface   The ResultSetMetaData interface represents the meta data of a ResultSet object. The following  sections introduce the most important methods.   getColumnCount   getColumnName   The getColumnCount method returns the number of columns in the ResultSet whose meta data is  represented by the ResultSetMetaData object. Its signature is as follows:   public int getColumnCount   throws SQLException   The getColumnName method returns the column name as the specified column index. Its  signature is as follows:   public String getColumnName int columnIndex  throws SQLException   The first column is indicated by index number 1.    Four Steps to Getting to the Database   This section explains what it takes to access a database and manipulate data in it.   Before you can manipulate data in a database, you need to connect to that database server. After  you get the connection, you can communicate with the database server. You can send an SQL  query to retrieve data from a table, update records, insert new records, or delete data you no longer  need. You also can do more than manipulate data: You can invoke a stored procedure, create a  table, and more.   Accessing a database with JDBC can be summarized in the following four steps:      71      1.  Load the JDBC database driver.  2.  Create a connection.  3.  Create a statement.  4.  Create a resultset, if you expect the database server to send back some data.   The discussion of each of these steps can be found in the following sections.   Step 1: Load a JDBC Database Driver   Database servers have their own proprietary "languages" for communication. This means that if  you want to communicate with a database server, you need to understand its language. Fortunately,  there are "translators" that can interface Java code with these database servers. These translators  take the form of JDBC drivers. In other words, if you want to access a particular database, you  need to get the JDBC driver for that database.   JDBC Drivers are available for most popular databases today. Oracle, Sybase, DB2, Microsoft  SQL Server, MySQLâyou name it. Drivers are even available for Open Database Connectivity   ODBC , which means that if you can't find a JDBC driver for a certain database but that database  can be connected through ODBC, you still can access the database through ODBC.   These JDBC drivers come at various prices and quality. Some are free and some are pricey. Some  are slow, and some are lightning fast. The list of JDBC drivers can be found at  http:  industry.java.sun.com products jdbc drivers.   Driver Types   Not all JDBC drivers are created equal. As mentioned previously, some are fast and some are slow.  Slower drivers are not necessarily inefficient code. Some drivers are slower than others due to  their architectural limitation. Depending on the architecture, a JDBC driver can fall into one of  four types: Type 1, Type 2, Type 3, and Type 4.   JDBC started with Type 1 drivers. Today this type is normally the slowest, used only when you  have no other alternative. Type 1 drivers are drivers that provide access to ODBC drivers and also  are called the JDBC-ODBC Bridge driver. This driver is included in the J2SE and J2EE  distribution and originally played an important role to help JDBC gain market acceptance. Why  the bridge? At the moment JDBC was conceived, ODBC had already ruled the database  connectivity world. Sun played a good strategy by enabling Java programmers to access any  database server that could be accessed through ODBC.   As previously mentioned, you don't use Type 1 drivers in production, unless you can't find other  drivers for that database. For rapid prototyping, however, these drivers are acceptable. For  example, if you need to prove a concept and a Microsoft Access database is all you have, the  JDBC-ODBC Bridge can allow access to it in no time.   Note that you need to set up an ODBC Data Source Name  DSN  on the computer you use to  connect to the database. Some ODBC native code and, in many cases, native database client code  must be loaded on each machine that uses this type of driver. Hence, this kind of driver is  generally most appropriate when automatic installation and downloading of a Java technology  application is not important.   Setting Up an ODBC Data Source Name   To set up an ODBC data source name, follow these steps:      72      1.  Open the ODBC Data Source Administration dialog box from the Control   Panel.   2.  Click the System DSN tab.  3.  Click the Add button.  4.  Select a driver name from the list of ODBC drivers.  5.  Enter the needed information in the Setup dialog box that appears.  6.  Click OK to close the dialog box.   Type 2 drivers are drivers written in part Java and part native API to convert JDBC calls into calls  on the client API for Oracle, Sybase, Informix, DB2, or other DBMS. Note that, like the bridge  driver, this style of driver requires that some binary code be loaded on each client machine.   Type 3 drivers are drivers written to use the network protocol to translate JDBC API calls into a  DBMS-independent net protocol, which is then translated to a DBMS protocol by a server. This  net server middleware is able to connect all of its Java technology-based clients to many different  databases. The specific protocol used depends on the vendor. In general, this is the most flexible  JDBC API alternativeâand most likely, all vendors of this solution will provide products suitable  for Intranet use. In order for these products also to support Internet access, they must handle the  additional requirements for security, access through firewalls, and so forth, that the web imposes.  Several vendors are adding JDBC technology-based drivers to their existing database middleware  products.   Type 4 drivers are pure Java. They are written to use the native protocol to convert JDBC  technology calls into the network protocol directly used by DBMSs. This allows a direct call from  the client machine to the DBMS server and is a practical solution for Intranet access. Because  many of these protocols are proprietary, the database vendors themselves will be the primary  source for this style of driver.   For the list of JDBC drivers for various databases, see  http:  industry.java.sun.com products jdbc drivers.   Installing JDBC Drivers   Because JDBC drivers normally come in a .jar file, the first thing you need to do after you get the  driver is tell Tomcat where to find it by copying the .jar file into the WEB-INF\lib directory under  your application directory. Create the lib directory if it doesn't exist.   Note   Note   If you are using the JDBC-ODBC bridge, you do not need to install the driver because it's  already included in your Java Development Kit  JDK .   Now that the driver is within reach, you can create an instance of it using the static forName  method of the Class class, passing the driver's fully qualified class name. The following is the  code:   Class.forName driverName    For example, for a MySQL database, the most popular driver is the Type 4 driver developed by  Mark Matthews of Purdue University and downloadable from  http:  www.worldserver.com mm.mysql . This driver is available under the GNU General Public      73      License. Assuming that you have downloaded it and made it available to your Java code, you can  load it using the following code:   Class.forName "org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver" ;   Of course, the driverName argument will be different if you are using a different driver for  MySQL.   For an ODBC database, the code that loads the driver is the following:   Class.forName "sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver" ;   Or, if you are using the FreeTds Type 4 JDBC driver to connect to a Microsoft SQL Server, you  use this code to load the driver:   Class.forName "com.internetcds.jdbc.tds.Driver" ;   Your JDBC driver should come with documentation that tells you the driver class name to use.   Note   Microsoft SQL Server 2000 has its own Type 4 JDBC Driver, downloadable from  http:  www.microsoft.com sql downloads 2000 jdbc.asp.   If you plan to connect to different database servers in your code, you need to load all JDBC  drivers for every database. For example, if you need to connect to an ODBC database as well as a  MySQL database, you load both drivers by using the following code:   Class.forName "sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver" ;   Class.forName "org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver" ;   Step 2: Creating a Connection   After you register a JDBC driver with the DriverManager, you can use it to get a connection to the  database. In JDBC, a database connection is represented by the java.sql.Connection interface. You  use the DriverManager class's getConnection method to obtain a Connection object.   As mentioned in the previous section, the getConnection method has three overloads, two of  which are normally used. The first overload takes three arguments: url, userName, and password.  Its signature is as follows:   public static Connection getConnection String url,     String user, String password      throws SQLException   The url part is the trickiest element in this method. The url is of this syntax:   jdbc:subprotocol:subname   The subprotocol and subname parts depend on the database server you use. The documentation of  the JDBC driver should tell you the subprotocol and subname to use.   If you are using a JDBC-ODBC bridge driver, the subprotocol is "odbc" and the subname is the  Data Source Name  DSN  for that database. For instance, for a DSN called MarketingData, your  URL will be:      74      jdbc:odbc:MarketingData   If you want to connect to a MySQL database, the subprotocol part is "mysql" and the subname  part should be given the name of the machine and the database. For example, for a database  named Fred, use the following:   jdbc:mysql   Fred   If one of the drivers you loaded recognizes the JDBC URL passed to the getConnection method,  that driver will try to establish a connection to the database specified in the URL. For example, the  following code shows how you obtain a Connection object to a MySQL database named Fred in a  server called robusta. You also pass the user "admin" and the password "secret" to the  getConnection method.   Connection connection =     DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:mysql   robusta Fred", "admin",  "secret" ;   You use the following code to get access to an ODBC database whose DSN is MarketingData,  using the user name "sa" and password "1945":   Connection connection =     DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:odbc:MarketingData", "sa",  "1945" ;   If the connection does not require you to login, you can pass null as arguments for the user and  password parts.   The other overload of the getConnection method allows you to pass the user and password  information in the URL. Its signature is as follows:   public static Connection getConnection String url      throws SQLException   For example, you can use the following URL to connect to a MySQL database named Fred in  robustathat requires the user name "me" and password "pwd":   DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:mysql:  robusta Fred?user=me&passwo rd=pwd" ;   Or, to connect to an ODBC database named MarketingData that is accessible without a login name  and password, you use the following:   Connection connection =     DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:odbc:MarketingData" ;   If one of the drivers you loaded recognizes the JDBC URL supplied to the method  DriverManager.getConnection, that driver will establish a connection to the DBMS specified in  the JDBC URL.   The getConnection method is probably the first and the last method of the DriverManager class  you need to know to write Java programs that access databases. Other methods are needed only if  you are writing a JDBC driver yourself.      75      The Connection object obtained through the DriverManager class's getConnection method is an  open connection you can use to pass your SQL statements to the database server. As such, you do  not need to have a special method to open a Connection.   Let's see what we can do with it in the next subsection: "Step 3 Creating a Statement."   Step 3: Creating a Statement   After you have a Connection object, your SQL skill takes over. Basically, you can pass any SQL  statement that your database server understands. The level of understanding is different from one  server to another. For example, an Oracle database is comfortable with subqueries, whereas a  MySQL server is not. Also, whether your SQL statement will be executed successfully on the  database server depends on the permission level of the user who passed the query to the database.  If the user has the permission to view all the tables in the database, you can pass an SQL SELECT  statement to it and expect some return. If the user has the permission to update records but not to  delete records, you can only update, not delete, records. You should understand these factors  before you program your JDBC code.   After you have a Connection object from the DriverManage.getConnection method, you are ready  to pass a SQL statement. To do this, you need to create another JDBC object called Statement.  You can do this using the createStatement method of the Connection interface. Although there are  two overloads of this method, the one that you almost always use is the no-argument overload. Its  signature is as follows:   public Statement createStatement   throws SQLException   Therefore, to create a Statement object from an open Connection object, you write the following:      connection is an open Connection object   Statement statement = connection.createStatement  ;   Next, use the methods in the Statement class interface to manipulate your data or data structure.  You will use two important methods: executeUpdate and executeQuery. The signatures for both  methods are as follows:   public int executeUpdate String sql  throws SQLException   public ResultSet executeQuery String sql  throws SQLException     The executeUpdate and executeQuery Methods   Both executeUpdate and executeQuery methods accept a String containing an SQL  statement. The SQL statement does not end with a DBMS statement terminator, which  can vary from DBMS to DBMS. For example, Oracle uses a semicolon  ;  to indicate  the end of a statement, and Sybase uses the word go. The driver you are using will  automatically supply the appropriate statement terminator, and you will not need to  include it in your JDBC code.   The executeUpdate method executes an SQL INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE  statement and also data definition language  DDL  statements to create, drop, and alter  tables. This method returns the row count for INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE  statements or returns 0 for SQL statements that return nothing.   The executeQuery method executes an SQL SELECT statement that returns data. This  method returns a single ResultSet object that is discussed next. The ResultSet object      76      contains the data produced by the given query. This method never returns a null.   For example, to create a table named Addresses with two fields, you can use the following code:   String sql = "CREATE TABLE Addresses " +     " FirstName VARCHAR 32 , LastName VARCHAR 32 ";   statement.executeUpdate sql ;   And, to insert a record in the Addresses table, you use the following code:   String sql = "INSERT INTO Addresses " +   "VALUES  'Don', 'Bradman' ";   statement.executeUpdate sql ;   You use executeQuery when you expect a ResultSet object. You learn about the ResultSet  interface in the next section.   Tip   The close method of Statement releases immediately this Statement object's database and  JDBC resources instead of waiting for this to happen when it is automatically closed at  garbage collection. Releasing resources as soon as you are finished with them is good  practiceâthat way, you avoid tying up database resources.   Step 4: Creating a ResultSet   A ResultSet is the representation of a database table that is returned from a Statement object. A  ResultSet object maintains a cursor pointing to its current row of data. When the cursor is first  returned, it is positioned before the first row. To access the first row of the ResultSet, you need to  call the next   method of the ResultSet interface.   The next   method moves the cursor to the next row and can return either a true or false value. It  returns true if the new current row is valid; it returns false if there are no more rows. Normally,  you use this method in a while loop to iterate through the ResultSet object.   To get the data from the ResultSet, you can use one of many the getXXX methods of ResultSet,  such as getInt, getLong, and so on. getShort You use the getInt method, for example, to obtain the  value of the designated column in the current row of this ResultSet object as an int in the Java  programming language. The getLong gets the cell data as a long, etc. The most commonly used  method is getString, which returns the cell data as a String. Using getString is preferable in many  cases because you don't need to worry about the data type of the table field in the database.   The getString method, similar to other getXXX methods, has two overloads that allow you to  retrieve a cell's data by passing either the column index or the column name. The signatures of the  two overloads of getString are as follows:   public String getString int columnIndex  throws SQLException   public String getString String columnName  throws SQLException   The following example illustrates the use of the next   method as well as the getString method.  The code is used to retrieve the FirstName and LastName columns from a table called Users. It  then iterates the returned ResultSet and prints to the console all the first names and last names in  the format "first name:last name". As you consider the following code, assume that you already  have a Statement object called statement:      77      String sql = "SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Users";   ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery sql ;   while  resultSet.next    {    System.out.println resultSet.getString 1  + ":" +   resultSet.getString "LastName"   ;   }   The first column is retrieved by passing its column index, which is 1 for the first column. The  second column is obtained by passing its column name.   Another important method is the close method that closes the ResultSet object when it is no longer  used. The close method releases this ResultSet object's database and JDBC resources immediately  instead of waiting for this to happen when it is automatically closed. A ResultSet object will be  closed automatically when it is garbage collected or when the Statement object that generated it is  closed, re-executed, or used to retrieve the next result from a sequence of multiple results. Always  call the close method to explicitly close the ResultSet object. Completing your example code, you  should put the following code right after you finish accessing the ResultSet object:   Note that if an SQL query results in zero row, the Statement object will return a ResultSet object  containing no row, not a null.   resultSet.close  ;   Putting It All Together   This section summarizes the four steps just discussed by presenting an example that uses the  FreeTds Type 4 JDBC driver to access the Users table in a Microsoft SQL Server database named  Registration. The database server is called Lampoon and you need to pass the user name "sa" and  password "s3m1c0nduct0r" to login to the database server. The SQL statement queries two  columns: FirstName and LastName. Upon retrieving the ResultSet, the statement will loop  through it to print all the first names and last names in the ResultSet. The code is given in Listing  4.1.   Listing 4.1 Accessing a Database   try {    Class.forName "com.internetcds.jdbc.tds.Driver" ;     Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection       "jdbc:freetds:sqlserver:  Lampoon Registration",       "sa", " s3m1c0nduct0r" ;     System.out.println "got connection" ;         Statement s = con.createStatement  ;     String sql =       "INSERT INTO UserReg VALUES  'a', 'b', '12 12 2001', 'f' ";     s.executeUpdate sql ;       sql = "SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Users";     ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery sql ;     while  rs.next    {      System.out.println rs.getString 1  + " " + rs.getString 2  ;     }     rs.close  ;     s.close  ;     con.close  ;   }   catch  ClassNotFoundException e1  {    System.out.println e1.toString   ;       78                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       }   catch  SQLException e2  {    System.out.println e2.toString   ;   }   catch  Exception e3  {    System.out.println e3.toString   ;   }   Jimmy Barnes   Richard Myers   George Lucas    A Database-Based Login Servlet   On my machine, the code returns the following at the console. The result displayed depends on the  data stored in your table, of course.   As your first example of connecting a database from a servlet, I would like to present the type of  servlet that is probably built most often: a Login servlet. Unlike the Login servlet in Chapter 3,  "Writing Servlet Applications," in which you hard-coded the user name and password that log in a  user, this servlet matches the entered user name and password against the values of the UserName  and Password columns in a table called Users. This table may have other columns, but those other  columns are not relevant here.   When the user types the URL in the Location or Address box and first calls the servlet, its doGet  method is invoked. The servlet then does what a login servlet should doâchallenges the user to  type in a user name and password. What the doGet does is call the private method sendLoginForm,  which sends the HTML page for the user to login.   sendLoginForm response, false ;   The sendLoginForm method accepts two arguments: a HttpServletResponse object that the  method can use to send output to the browser, and a boolean. This boolean is a flag to indicate  whether an error message should be sent along with the form. The error message tells the user that  the previous login has failed. When the servlet is first called, of course, no error message is sent;  thus the false value is given for the second argument of the sendLoginForm method called from  doGet. The sendLoginForm method is given in Listing 4.2. The Login page is shown in Figure 4.1.   Figure 4.1. The database-based Login servlet.      79         Listing 4.2 The LoginServlet's sendLoginForm Method   private void sendLoginForm HttpServletResponse response,       boolean withErrorMessage        throws ServletException, IOException {        response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Login " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;         if  withErrorMessage          out.println "Login failed. Please try again. " ;         out.println " " ;       out.println "  Login Page " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Please enter your user name and password." ;       out.println " " ;       out.println "  " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " User Name: " ;       out.println "   " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Password: " ;       out.println "   " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       80          out.println "  " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;     }   The user can then type the user name and password to login and click the Submit button. Upon  submit, the doPost method is invoked. The first thing it does is obtain the userName and password  from the HttpServletRequest object, as follows:   String userName = request.getParameter "userName" ;   String password = request.getParameter "password" ;   Then, the method passes the userName and password to the login method. This method returns  true if the user name and password are correct; otherwise, it returns false. On successful login, the  request is dispatched to another servlet, as follows:   RequestDispatcher rd =     request.getRequestDispatcher "AnotherServlet" ;   rd.forward request, response ;   If the login failed, the doPost calls the sendLoginForm method again, this time with an error  message, as follows:   sendLoginForm response, true ;   The doPost method is given in Listing 4.3.   Listing 4.3 The LoginServlet's doPost Method   public void doPost HttpServletRequest request,       HttpServletResponse response        throws ServletException, IOException {        String userName = request.getParameter "userName" ;       String password = request.getParameter "password" ;       if  login userName, password   {        RequestDispatcher rd =           request.getRequestDispatcher "AnotherServlet" ;         rd.forward request, response ;       }       else {        sendLoginForm response, true ;       }   }   Here is the part that does the authentication: the login method. The method tries to authenticate the  user by trying to retrieve a record whose UserName field is userName and Password field is the  same as password. If a record is found, the login succeeds; otherwise, the login fails.   The login method first loads the JDBC driver, as follows:   Class.forName "sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver" ;      81      This example uses a JDBC-ODBC driver; however, as you learned in the previous section, you  can use any other driver without changing the rest of your code.   With a JDBC driver, you can create a Connection object and call its createStatement method to  create a Statement object, as follows:   Connection con =     DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:odbc:JavaWeb" ;   Statement s = con.createStatement  ;   Note that you use the getConnection method overload that accepts an argumentâthe URL.   When a Statement object is available, you can call its executeQuery method, passing an SQL  statement of the following syntax:   SELECT UserName FROM Users   WHERE UserName=userName   AND Password=password   To determine whether there is any record in the ResultSet object, you can call its next   method.  This method returns true if there is a record; otherwise, it returns false. On true, the login method  returns a true, indicating a successful login. A false return value indicates otherwise. The login  method is given in Listing 4.4, and the complete code for LoginServlet is given in Listing 4.5.   Listing 4.4 The LoginServlet's login Method   boolean login String userName, String password  {    try {      Class.forName "sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver" ;       Connection con =         DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:odbc:JavaWeb" ;       System.out.println "got connection" ;         Statement s = con.createStatement  ;       String sql = "SELECT UserName FROM Users" +         " WHERE UserName='" + userName + "'" +         " AND Password='" + password + "'";       ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery sql ;       if  rs.next    {        rs.close  ;         s.close  ;         con.close  ;         return true;       }       rs.close  ;       s.close  ;       con.close  ;     }     catch  ClassNotFoundException e  {      System.out.println e.toString   ;     }     catch  SQLException e  {      System.out.println e.toString   ;     }     catch  Exception e  {      System.out.println e.toString   ;     }     return false;       82      }   Listing 4.5 The LoginServlet Servlet   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;   import java.sql.*;  import java.util.*;     public class LoginServlet extends HttpServlet {      public void doGet HttpServletRequest request,     HttpServletResponse response      throws ServletException, IOException {    sendLoginForm response, false ;   }     private void sendLoginForm HttpServletResponse response,     boolean withErrorMessage      throws ServletException, IOException {      response.setContentType "text html" ;     PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;     out.println " " ;     out.println " " ;     out.println " Login " ;     out.println " " ;     out.println " " ;     out.println " " ;       if  withErrorMessage        out.println "Login failed.

The servlet passes  the user name and password to the login method and the SQL statement is composed on the fly.  For example, for user name equals "jeff" and password "java", the SQL statement is as follows:   SELECT UserName   FROM Users       84      WHERE UserName='jeff'   AND Password='java'   SELECT UserName   FROM Users   WHERE UserName='o'connor'   AND Password='java'   The values for the user name and the password are enclosed in the single quote pairs, as in 'jeff '  and 'java'. A username can be anything, including a name that includes an apostrophe, such as  o'connor. This is also true for passwords. If the username is "o'connor" and password is "java," the  SQL statement will become the following:   The database engine will encounter a single quote character after the o in "o'connor," and think it  sees the end of the value for UserName, and expect a space after it. The engine finds a c instead,  and this is confusing to the database server. An error will be thrown.   Does this mean you can't let users have a username that contains an apostrophe? Fortunately, there  is a work around. If a string value in an SQL statement contains an apostrophe, you just need to  prefix the apostrophe with another apostrophe, resulting in the following SQL statement:   SELECT UserName   FROM Users   WHERE UserName='o''connor'   AND Password='java'   Now everything works correctly. The LoginServlet servlet in the previous example should be  fixed by passing all values entered by the user to a method called fixSQLFieldValue, which  accepts a String. This method will replace every occurrence of a single quote character in the  String with two single quote characters. The fixSQLFieldValue takes a String whose value may  contain a single quote character and doubles every occurrence of it.   The fixSQLFieldValue method uses a StringBuffer with an initial capacity of 1.1 times the length  of the argument passed in String object. The 1.1 is based on the estimate that the resulting SQL  statement will be at most 10 percent longer. Here is the code:   StringBuffer fixedValue = new StringBuffer  int   length* 1.1  ;   The statement then tests each character of the String in a for loop. If a character is a single quote,  it appends two single quote characters to the StringBuffer; otherwise, the character itself is  appended, as you see here:   for  int i=0; i<length; i++  {    char c = value.charAt i ;     if  c == '\''        fixedValue.append "''" ;     else       fixedValue.append c ;   }   The fixSqlFieldValue method is given in Listing 4.6.   Listing 4.6 The fixSqlFieldValue Method   public static String fixSqlFieldValue String value  {    if  value == null        return null;       85        int length = value.length  ;     StringBuffer fixedValue =       new StringBuffer  int   length * 1.1  ;     for  int i=0; i<length; i++  {      char c = value.charAt i ;       if  c == '\''          fixedValue.append "''" ;       else         fixedValue.append c ;     }     return fixedValue.toString  ;   }   The login method in Listing 4.5 and Listing 4.6 must pass the userName and password values  before composing the SQL statement. With the fixSqlFieldValue method included in the  LoginServlet servlet, the part that forms the SQL statement should be modified into the following  line:   String sql = "SELECT UserName FROM Users" +     " WHERE UserName='" + fixSqlFieldValue userName  + "'" +     " AND Password='" + fixSqlFieldValue password  + "'";   Clearly, the fixSqlFieldValue method should be called every time you compose an SQL statement  that includes a value from the user input. The method has been included in the StringUtil class that  is part of the com.brainysoftware.java.package included in the CD of this book. The use of this  method in the next sample code will be from this package. This at least saves having to write the  same code in all classes that need it. This method in the StringUtil class is made static so that you  can just call it with the following code:   import com.brainysoftware.java.StringUtil   StringUtil.fixSqlFieldValue string    To use this class, you need to create a directory structure under the  WEB-INF classes directory  under your application directory; that is, you need to create a directory called com under the  classes directory, the brainysoftware directory under com, the java directory under the  brainysoftware directory, and copy the StringUtil.class there.    Inserting Data into a Table with RegistrationServlet   Inserting a record into a table is a common database task. An example of this is a servlet named  RegistrationServlet that takes user input to insert a record into a Users table. The table itself has  columns as described in Table 4.1.   Column  Name   Id   Column  Type  Numeric   FirstName  LastName  UserName  Password   String  String  String  String   Table 4.1. The Users Table   Description   An autonumber that serves as the primary key and is auto- incremented by the database.  The first name of the user.  The last name of the user.  The user name for the user to login. No duplicate allowed.  The password for the user to login.      86      To insert a record containing a user's details, you need to retrieve the values entered by the user  and compose an SQL Statement, such as the following:   INSERT INTO Users    FirstName, LastName, UserName, Password    VALUES    firstName, lastName, userName, password    The Id column is not included because it's an autonumber. A new unique number will be  generated by the database server automatically for the Id column when you insert a new record  into the table. Also note that the UserName column value must be unique. No two users can have  the same user name.   When first called, the RegistrationServlet displays an HTML form with four text boxes, as shown  in Figure 4.2.   Figure 4.2. The RegistrationServlet.   The user can then fill in the necessary details: first name, last name, and a self-chosen user name  and password. The user name must be unique. If the user enters a user name that's already taken,  the servlet will display an error message and present the same form again, with the previously  typed in values retained  see Figure 4.3 .   Figure 4.3. Failed registration because the user name has been taken.         87         If the servlet encounters an unexpected error, the error also will be displayed and the previously  entered values retained.   On successful registration, the servlet will display the message "Successfully added one user." and  present a clean form. The user then can enter another user's details if desired.   In the RegistrationServlet, the method to display the form is called sendRegistrationForm. The  method accepts three arguments: an HttpServletRequest object, an HttpServletResponse object,  and a boolean. The boolean indicates whether the previously entered values, if any, should be  displayed. The sendRegistrationForm method is given in Listing 4.7. Note that when you need to  display a value in an HTML input box, you need to call the encodeHtmlTag method  which is also  part of the com.brainysoftware.java.StringUtil class  just in case the value contains one of the four  HTML special characters, as described in Chapter 3. The RegistrationServlet therefore imports the  com.brainysoftware.java.StringUtil class.   Listing 4.7 The sendRegistrationForm Method   private void sendRegistrationForm HttpServletRequest request,       HttpServletResponse response, boolean displayPreviousValues        throws ServletException, IOException {        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println "  Registration Page " ;       out.println " Please enter the user details." ;       out.println " " ;       out.println "  " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " First Name " ;       out.print " <INPUT TYPE=TEXT Name=firstName" ;         if  displayPreviousValues          out.print " VALUE=\"" +       88                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®             StringUtil.encodeHtmlTag firstName  + "\"" ;         out.println "> " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Last Name " ;       out.print " <INPUT TYPE=TEXT Name=lastName" ;         if  displayPreviousValues          out.print " VALUE=\"" +         StringUtil.encodeHtmlTag lastName  + "\"" ;           out.println "> " ;         out.println " " ;         out.println " " ;         out.println " User Name " ;         out.print " <INPUT TYPE=TEXT Name=userName" ;           if  displayPreviousValues            out.print " VALUE=\"" +           StringUtil.encodeHtmlTag userName  + "\"" ;           out.println "> " ;         out.println " " ;         out.println " " ;         out.println " Password " ;         out.print " <INPUT TYPE=PASSWORD Name=password" ;           if  displayPreviousValues            out.print " VALUE=\"" +           StringUtil.encodeHtmlTag password  + "\"" ;           out.println "> " ;         out.println " " ;         out.println " " ;         out.println "   " ;         out.println "   " ;         out.println " " ;         out.println " " ;         out.println " " ;         out.println " " ;         out.println " " ;       }   Unlike the form in the LoginServlet, however, the registration form does not include the    tag, the head section of the HTML, and the opening   tag. Nor does it contain the closing    and   tags. Page headers can be sent to the browser by calling the  sendPageHeader method, whose code is given in Listing 4.8.   Listing 4.8 The sendPageHeader Method   private void sendPageHeader HttpServletResponse response        throws ServletException, IOException {      response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Registration Page " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       89        }   The page footer can be sent by calling the sendPageFooter method, listed in Listing 4.9.   Listing 4.9 The sendPageFooter Method   private void sendPageFooter HttpServletResponse response      throws ServletException, IOException {    PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;     out.println " " ;     out.println " " ;     out.println " " ;   }   When first called, the servlet invokes its doGet method to send the registration form plus all  necessary HTML tags to the browser. The doGet method is given in Listing 4.10.   Listing 4.10 The doGet Method   public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse     response  throws ServletException, IOException {      sendPageHeader response ;       sendRegistrationForm request, response, false ;       sendPageFooter response ;   }   When the user submits the form, the doPost method is invoked. The doPost method first retrieves  the values from the users, as follows:   firstName = request.getParameter "firstName" ;   lastName = request.getParameter "lastName" ;   userName = request.getParameter "userName" ;   password = request.getParameter "password" ;   After opening a Connection object and creating a Statement object, the method needs to determine  whether the user name has already been taken. It does so by trying to retrieve a record whose  UserName field value is userName, as follows:   Connection con =     DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:odbc:JavaWeb" ;   Statement s = con.createStatement  ;   String sql = "SELECT UserName FROM Users" +     " WHERE userName='" +     StringUtil.fixSQLFieldValue userName  + "'";   ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery sql ;   If the ResultSet object returned by the Statement interface's executeQuery method has a record, its  next method will return true, indicating that the user name has already been taken; otherwise, false  is returned.   If the user name has been taken, a message of "The user nameâ¦ has been taken" is assigned to the  message String and the error flag is set. If not, an SQL statement will be composed on the fly and  the executeUpdate method of the Statement object will be called to insert a new record into the  Users table, as seen in Figure 4.4.   Figure 4.4. Successful registration.      90         if  rs.next    {    rs.close  ;     message = "The user name  " +       StringUtil.encodeHtmlTag userName  +       "  has been taken. Please select another name.";     error = true;   }   else {    rs.close  ;     sql = "INSERT INTO Users" +       "  FirstName, LastName, UserName, Password " +       " VALUES" +       "  '" +  StringUtil.fixSQLFieldValue firstName  + "'," +       " '" +  StringUtil.fixSQLFieldValue lastName  + "'," +       " '" +  StringUtil.fixSQLFieldValue userName  + "'," +       " '" +  StringUtil.fixSQLFieldValue password  + "' ";     int i = s.executeUpdate sql ;     if  i == 1  {      message = "Successfully added one user.";     }   }   The last part of the doPost method checks whether the message is null and whether the error flag  has been set. If the message is not null, it is sent to the browser, as you see here:   if  message != null  {    PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;     out.println " " + message + "  " ;     out.println "  " ;   }   If the error is set, the registration form is sent with the last argument equal to true, indicating the  sendRegistrationForm to display the previously entered values. Otherwise, the  sendRegistrationForm method is sent with the false value for the last argument, as you see here:      91      if  error == true        sendRegistrationForm request, response, true ;     else       sendRegistrationForm request, response, false ;     sendPageFooter response ;   }   The doPost method is given in Listing 4.11.   Listing 4.11 The doPost Method   public void doPost HttpServletRequest request,       HttpServletResponse response        throws ServletException, IOException {      sendPageHeader response ;         firstName = request.getParameter "firstName" ;       lastName = request.getParameter "lastName" ;       userName = request.getParameter "userName" ;       password = request.getParameter "password" ;         boolean error = false;       String message = null;       try {      Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:odbc:JavaWeb" ;       System.out.println "got connection" ;         Statement s = con.createStatement  ;         String sql = "SELECT UserName FROM Users" +         " WHERE userName='" + StringUtil.fixSQLFieldValue userName  +  "'";       ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery sql ;       if  rs.next    {        rs.close  ;         message = "The user name  "+  StringUtil.encodeHtmlTag userName  + "  has been taken.

Instead, it has been moved to the init method of the servlet. The JDBC driver needs to be loaded  only once, so it is appropriate to put it in the init method, which is only called once during the life  cycle of the servlet. The init method is given in Listing 4.12.        }     catch  Exception e  {      message = "Error." + e.toString  ;       error = true;     }     if  message != null  {      PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " + message + "  " ;       out.println "  " ;     }     if  error == true        sendRegistrationForm request, response, true ;     else       sendRegistrationForm request, response, false ;     sendPageFooter response ;   }   Listing 4.12 The init Method of the RegistrationServlet   public void init   {      try {        Class.forName "sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver" ;         System.out.println "JDBC driver loaded" ;       }       catch  ClassNotFoundException e  {        System.out.println e.toString   ;       }   }   The complete code of the RegistrationServlet servlet is given in Listing 4.13.

You can achieve this task easily  with the knowledge of JDBC you have learned so far. Which data you need to display depends on  your application. In this section and the next, you will display data and format it in an HTML table.  This section displays all records in the Users table, and the next section implements a Search Page  that displays data selectively.   Displaying all records could not be simpler. You need only to open a Connection, create a  Statement object, and execute a query to produce a ResultSet object. You then iterate each record      96      in a while loop. The code is very straightforward and is given in Listing 4.14. The output of this  servlet is shown in Figure 4.5.   Figure 4.5. Displaying all records from a table.      Listing 4.14 Displaying All Records in the Users Table   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;   import java.sql.*;   import com.brainysoftware.java.StringUtil;     public class DataViewerServlet extends HttpServlet {     **Load JDBC driver*      public void init   {      try {        Class.forName "sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver" ;         System.out.println "JDBC driver loaded" ;       }       catch  ClassNotFoundException e  {        System.out.println e.toString   ;       }         }        **Process the HTTP Get request*        public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response  throws ServletException, IOException {        response.setContentType "text html" ;           PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;         out.println " " ;         out.println " " ;         out.println " Display All Users " ;         out.println " " ;       97            out.println " " ;         out.println " " ;         out.println "  Displaying All Users " ;         out.println " " ;         out.println " " ;         out.println " " ;         out.println " " ;         out.println " First Name " ;         out.println " Last Name " ;         out.println " User Name " ;         out.println " Password " ;         out.println " " ;           String sql = "SELECT FirstName, LastName, UserName, Password" +           " FROM Users";         try {          Connection con =  DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:odbc:JavaWeb" ;           System.out.println "got connection" ;             Statement s = con.createStatement  ;           ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery sql ;             while  rs.next    {            out.println " " ;             out.println " " +  StringUtil.encodeHtmlTag rs.getString 1   + " " ;             out.println " " +  StringUtil.encodeHtmlTag rs.getString 2   + " " ;             out.println " " +  StringUtil.encodeHtmlTag rs.getString 3   + " " ;             out.println " " +  StringUtil.encodeHtmlTag rs.getString 4   + " " ;             out.println " " ;           }           rs.close  ;           s.close  ;           con.close  ;         }         catch  SQLException e  {        }         catch  Exception e  {        }         out.println " " ;         out.println " " ;         out.println " " ;         out.println " " ;       }         public void doPost HttpServletRequest request,  HttpServletResponse response  throws ServletException, IOException {        doGet request, response ;       }     }    Search Page      98                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       In many cases, displaying all records is not preferable. More often than not, you need only to  display data selectively. For example, someone might try to find the details of a person called  Jones without knowing the person's first name. Displaying all the users does not help much,  especially if you have a large number of records in the table. The page is more useful if you can  let the user specify a keyword and display all records that match the keyword.   In this example, you will write a SearchServlet that lets the user enter a keyword that could be the  first name, the last name, or even part of the first name or last name. The appearance of this servlet  output is shown in Figure 4.6.   Figure 4.6. The SearchServlet.   The main part of this servlet is the sendSearchResult method that connects to the database,  executes the following SQL statement, and sends the result to the browser.      SELECT FirstName, LastName, UserName, Password   FROM Users   WHERE FirstName LIKE '%keyword%'   OR LastName LIKE '%keyword%'   The code is given in Listing 4.15.

When  connecting to a database from a servlet, however, it is often the case that the database resides  somewhere beyond your physical reach. Oftentimes, the only way to connect to the database is  through the database client program. Of course, the client program needs to be installed on the  computer you are using to connect to the database. This is not good if you need to be mobile, or if  you need to be able to connect to the database from different locations. Because the database is  available to a servlet, you can also make it available online.   The program given in this application is an online SQL tool that lets you manipulate your data or  data structure by using a web browser. You can type in any SQL statement and send it to the  server to be executed by the database server. If the database server returns a ResultSet, the tool  displays it in the form of a table. If the database server sends an error message, that also is  displayed in the form. The form is shown in Figure 4.7.   Figure 4.7. The online SQL Tool.   The user can type an SQL statement in the box. Figures 4.8 and 4.9 show how the form looks  when the database server returns a ResultSet and when it notifies the user that it has successfully  executed an SQL that affects one record.         102      Figure 4.8. The SQL Tool with a returned ResultSet.   Figure 4.9. The SQL Tool after inserting a new record.         When first called, the servlet will invoke the doGet method that calls the sendSqlForm. The latter  sends the SQL form to the browser. The doGet method is given in Listing 4.16.   Listing 4.16 The doGet Method of the SQLToolServlet      103      public void doGet HttpServletRequest request,     HttpServletResponse response    throws ServletException, IOException {    sendSqlForm request, response ;   }   The sendSqlForm method does what its name implies: it sends the SQL form. The method is given  in Listing 4.17.   Listing 4.17 The sendSqlForm Method   private void sendSqlForm HttpServletRequest request,       HttpServletResponse response        throws ServletException, IOException {        response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " SQL Tool Servlet " ;         out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println "  SQL Tool " ;       out.println " Please type your SQL statement in the following  box." ;       out.println " " ;       out.println "  " ;       out.println " " ;       String sql = request.getParameter "sql" ;            Reprint the previously entered SQL in the TextArea       if  sql != null          out.println sql ;         out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;         if  sql != null  {        executeSql sql.trim  , response ;       }         out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;     }   The sendSqlForm method retrieves the sql value from the HttpServletRequest object. When this  method is called from the doGet method, the sql parameter is null. When called from the doPost  method, however, the sql parameter is not null. When the latter is the case, the executeSql method  is called.   The executeSql method accepts a String containing the SQL statement, which it tries to execute,  and a HttpServletResponse object that it can write to for sending text to the browser. The  executeSql method is given in Listing 4.18.      104      Listing 4.18 The executeSql Method   public void executeSql String sql, HttpServletResponse response        throws ServletException, IOException {        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;

        out.println " " ;         out.println e.toString   ;       }     }   }    Should I Keep the Connection Open?   All the examples given up to this point in this chapter have closed the Connection object after the  servlet services the request. However, you might ask the following question: If the servlet is called  more than once and it opens a Connection object with the same arguments  url, user, and password   each time, wouldn't it better to leave the Connection object open for future use; that is, for when  the servlet is called again?   In fact, opening a Connection object is one of the most expensive operations in database  programming. Being able to save CPU cycles by keeping the Connection object is very tempting.  In many reference books, however, including those of non-Java web programming, you are always  told to close the Connection object as soon as it's no longer needed. The recommendation is so  intense that some people have the impression that keeping the connection open is forbidden. Why?   Actually, an open connection is not taboo. Whether to leave the Connection object open really  depends on the application you are building. First, however, you should consider that it is true that  the response time will be faster if you can access the database without having to open a  Connection object. For example, you can make the object variable of the Connection object class  level so that it can be accessed from anywhere in the servlet and put the code that opens the  Connection object in the init method. This way, the Connection object will be opened when the  servlet first initializes. On subsequent requests, the Connection is already open, so the user will  experience faster response.   A servlet can be accessed by multiple users at the same time, however. The bad news is that the  underlying architecture of the Connection object will allow only one query to be processed at a  time. As a result, only one user can use the connection at a time. The others will have to queue.  Considering that modern databases allow multiple connections, this is really a waste.   The conclusion is that if your servlet is accessed only by a single user at a time, leaving the  Connection object open makes the response time faster. If you can't guarantee that there will not  be simultaneous accesses to the servlet, however, response time will start to decrease because the  second and subsequent users have to wait until the first user gets serviced.   That's why, except in some rare cases, you should always close your Connection object. Rather  than having the Connection object open, a technique called connection pooling is implemented by  the driver to manage the Connection objects to a database so that multiple connections can be  pooled. A connection can be used and, when finished, returned to the pool to be used by another  request.        108                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       Transactions   A transaction is a unit of work that can comprise one or more SQL operations. In the examples  you have seen so far, every SQL operation is executed and the change is committed  made  permanent  on the database right after the SQL statement is executed.   In some cases, however, a set of SQL operations must succeed or fail as a whole. If one of the  SQL statements fails, the other SQL statements in the group must also be rolled back. Consider  the following scenario.   In an online store a customer purchases several books. When the customer checks out and pays  using a credit card, the following things must happen:   1.  A record must be added to the Orders table specifying the order, including the delivery  address and the credit card details. This operation results in an OrderId used to identify  each item in the OrderDetails table.   2.  A record must be inserted into the OrderDetails table for each purchase item. Each item is  linked to the Orders table using the OrderId value returned by the previous SQL operation.   Now, if everything goes smoothly, both SQL statements will be executed successfully in the  database. Things can go wrong, however. Say, for example, the first operation is committed  successfully but the second SQL statement fails. In this case, the order details are lost and the  customer won't get anything. The customer's credit card will still be debited by the amount of the  purchase, however, because a record is added to the Orders table.   In this case, you want both SQL statements to succeed or fail as a whole. You can do this using a  transaction. Upon a failed transaction, you can notify the customer so that he or she can try to  check out again.   By default, a Connection object's auto-commit state is true, meaning that the database is updated  when an SQL statement is executed. If you want to group a set of SQL statements in one  transaction, you must first tell the Connection object not to update the change until it is explicitly  notified to do so. You do this by calling the setAutoCommit method and passing false as its  argument, as follows:   connection.setAutoCommit false ;   Then, you can execute all the SQL statements in the group normally, using the executeQuery and  the updateQuery methods. After the last call to the executeQuery or the updateQuery method, you  call the commit method of the Connection object to make the database changes permanent, such as   If you don't call the commit method within a specified time, all SQL statements will be rolled back  after calling the setAutoCommit method. Alternatively, you can roll back the transaction explicitly  by calling the Connection object's rollback method:   connection.commit  ;   connection.rollback  ;   Note   You learn how to use transactions further when you build a shopping cart in Chapter 18,  "Developing E-Commerce Applications."      109        Connection Pooling   Creating a Connection object is one of the most expensive operations in database programming.  This is especially true when the Connection object is used for only one or two SQL operations, as  demonstrated in the servlets discussed in this chapter.   To make the use of Connection objects more efficient, those objects are not pooled. When the  application starts, a certain number of Connection objects are created and stored in a pool. When a  database client, such as a servlet, needs to use a Connection object, it does not create the object  but instead requests one from the pool. When the client is finished with it, the Connection object is  returned to the pool.   You can create a pool of Connection objects programmatically; however, there is an easier and  more robust way: by using the connection pooling feature of the JDBC Optional Package. The  good thing about this feature is that the connection pooling is transparent. There is no single line  of code that the programmer needs to change to use it.   To use the connection pooling feature in the javax.sql package, you need to connect to the data  source using the javax.sql.DataSource interface. The code for getting a connection utilizes JNDI,  which is briefly discussed in Chapter 28, "Enterprise JavaBeans." The code is as follows:   Context context = new InitialContext  ;   DataSource ds =  DataSource context.lookup "jdbc myDB" ;   Connection connection = ds.getConnection user, password     Summary   Database access is one of the most important aspects of web programming. Java has its own  technology for this called JDBC, whose functionality is wrapped in a package called java.sql. In  this chapter, you have seen various members of this package and learned how to use them. You  also have learned how to create servlets that access a database. A couple of servlets have been  created that illustrate various real-life applications.      110      Chapter 5. Session Management   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol  HTTP  is the network protocol that web servers and client  browsers use to communicate with each other. HTTP is the language of the web. HTTP  connections are initiated by a client browser that sends an HTTP request. The web server then  responds with an HTTP response and closes the connection. If the same client requests another  resource from the server, it must open another HTTP connection to the server. The server always  closes the connection as soon as it sends the response, whether or not the browser user needs some  other resource from the server.   This process is similar to a telephone conversation in which the receiver always hangs up after  responding to the last remark question from the caller. For example, a call goes something like  this:   Caller dials. Caller gets connected.   Caller: "Hi, good morning."   Receiver: "Good morning."   Receiver hangs up.   Caller dials again. Caller gets connected.   Caller: "May I speak to Dr. Zeus, please?"   Receiver: "Sure."   Receiver hangs up.   Caller dials again, and so on, and so on.   Putting this in a web perspective, because the web server always disconnects after it responds to a  request, the web server does not know whether a request comes from a user who has just requested  the first page or from a user who has requested nine other pages before. As such, HTTP is said to  be stateless.   Being stateless has huge implications. Consider, for example, a user who is shopping at an online  store. As usual, the process starts with the user searching for a product. If the product is found, the  user then enters the quantity of that product into the shopping cart form and submits it to the  server. But, the user is not yet checking outâshe still wants to buy something else. So she  searches the catalog again for the second product.The first product order has now been lost,  however, because the previous connection was closed and the web server does not remember  anything about the previous connection.   The good news is that web programmers can work around this, and this chapter discusses  techniques for that. The solution is called user session management. The web server is forced to  associate HTTP requests and client browsers.    What Is Session Management?      111      You know that HTTP statelessness has a deep impact on web application programming. To see the  problem more clearly, consider the LoginServlet in Chapter 3, "Writing Servlet Applications," and  Chapter 4, "Accessing Databases with JDBC." The skeleton is presented here:   public void doGet HttpServletRequest request,     HttpServletResponse response      throws ServletException, IOException {    sendLoginForm response, false ;   }     public void doPost HttpServletRequest request,     HttpServletResponse response      throws ServletException, IOException {      String userName = request.getParameter "userName" ;     String password = request.getParameter "password" ;     if  login userName, password   {         login successful, display the information     }     else {           login failed, re-send the Login form       sendLoginForm response, true ;     }   }   The Login servlet is used to require users to enter a valid user name and pass-word before they can  see some information. When a user first requests the servlet, the Login form is displayed. The user  then can enter a user name and password and submit the form. Assuming that the form uses the  POST method, the user information is captured in the doPost method, which does the  authentication by calling the login method. If the login was successful, the information is  displayed. If not, the Login form is sent again.   What if you have another servlet that also only allows authorized users to view the information?  This second servlet does not know whether the same user has successfully logged in to the first  servlet. Consequently, the user will be required to log in again!   This is, of course, not practical. Every time a user goes to request a protected servlet, he or she has  to login again even though all the servlets are part of the same application. This easily pushes the  user to the edge of frustration and most likely results in a lost customer.   Fortunately, there are ways to get around this, using techniques for remembering a user's session.  Once users have logged in, they do not have to login again. The application will remember them.  This is called session management.   Session management, also called session tracking, goes beyond simply remembering a user who  has successfully logged in. Anything that makes the application remember information that has  been entered or requested by the user can be considered session management. Session  management does not change the nature of HTTP statelessnessâit simply provides a way around  it.   By principle, you manage a user's session by performing the following to servlets pages that need  to remember a user's state:   1.  When the user requests a servlet, in addition to sending the response, the servlet also   sends a token or an identifier.      112      2.   If the user does not come back with the next request for the same or a different servlet,  that is fine. If the user does come back, the token or identifier is sent back to the server.  Upon encountering the token, the next servlet should recognize the identifier and can do a  certain action based on the token. When the servlet responds to the request, it also sends  the same or a different token. This goes on and on with all the servlets that need to  remember a user's session.   You will use four techniques for session management. They operate based on the same principle,  although what is passed and how it is passed is different from one to another. The techniques are  as follows:      URL rewriting     Hidden fields     Cookies     Session objects   Which technique you use depends on what you need to do in your application. Each of the  techniques is discussed in the sections below. The section, "Knowing Which Technique to Use,"  concludes the chapter.    URL Rewriting   With URL rewriting, you append a token or identifier to the URL of the next servlet or the next  resource. You can send parameter name value pairs using the following format:   url?name1=value1&name2=value2&â¦   A name and a value is separated using an equal sign  = ; a parameter name value pair is separated  from another parameter name value pair using the ampersand  & . When the user clicks the  hyperlink, the parameter name value pairs will be passed to the server. From a servlet, you can use  the HttpServletRequest interface's getParameter method to obtain a parameter value. For instance,  to obtain the value of the second parameter, you write the following:   request.getParameter name2 ;   The use of URL rewriting is easy. When using this technique, however, you need to consider  several things:      The number of characters that can be passed in a URL is limited. Typically, a browser can   pass up to 2,000 characters.      The value that you pass can be seen in the URL. Sometimes this is not desirable. For   example, some people prefer their password not to appear on the URL.      You need to encode certain charactersâsuch as & and ? characters and white spacesâ  that you append to a URL.   As an example, you will build an application that you can use to administer all registered persons  in a database. The application uses the Users table created in Chapter 4 and allows you to do the  following:   1.  Enter a keyword that will become the search key for the first name and the last name   columns of the Users table.   2.  Display all persons that match the keyword.      113      3.   4.   5.   In addition to the data for each record, there are Delete and Update hyperlinks. The user  id is included in the hyperlinks.  If the Delete hyperlink is clicked, the corresponding person will be deleted from the Users  table.  If the Update hyperlink is clicked, the corresponding person's details will be displayed in  a form. You then can change the data and submit the form to update that person's record.   The Administration application is shown in Figures 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3.   Figure 5.1. The Administration's Search page.   Figure 5.2. The Administrations Delete page.         114      Figure 5.3. The Administration's Update page.         The first servlet, the SearchServlet, is similar to the one in Chapter 4. The doGet method sends the  form for the user to type in a keyword. This keyword could be a first name, a last name, or part of  a first name or a last name. To allow more flexibility, this example separates the form from the  rest of the page. Therefore, you send the page header and page footer separately. The doGet  method is given in Listing 5.1.      115      Listing 5.1 The doGet Method of the SearchServlet   public void doGet HttpServletRequest request,     HttpServletResponse response      throws ServletException, IOException {      sendPageHeader response ;       sendSearchForm response ;       sendPageFooter response ;     }   The page header contains the head part of the HTML page, including the page title and the  opening   tag. To send the page header, you call the sendPageHeader method. The page  footer contains the bottom part of the page, that is, the closing   and   tags.  Calling the sendPageFooter method will send the page footer.   The sendSearchForm method sends the HTML form. This form uses the POST method and, when  submitted, this form will send the keyword to the server. The server then invokes the doPost  method whose code is given in Listing 5.2.   Listing 5.2 The doPost Method of the SearchServlet   public void doPost HttpServletRequest request,     HttpServletResponse response      throws ServletException, IOException {      keyword = request.getParameter "keyword" ;     sendPageHeader response ;     sendSearchForm response ;     sendSearchResult response ;     sendPageFooter response ;   }   The first thing doPost does is retrieve the keyword from the HttpServletRequest object and store it  in a class-level variable keyword. It then sends the page header, the search form, the search result,  and the page footer to the browser.   The sendSearchResult method forms an SQL select statement that incorporates the keyword, in  the following syntax:   SELECT Id, FirstName, LastName, UserName, Password   FROM Users   WHERE FirstName LIKE '%keyword%'   OR LastName LIKE '%keyword%'   Note that the % character represents any text of zero length or more. This means that jo% will find  jo, john, jones, and so on. Note, however, that this wildcard character is different from one  database server to another and you should consult your database server documentation before  using it.   Because the value entered by the user as the keyword can contain a single quote character, you use  the StringUtil class's fixSqlFieldValue method to "fix" the keyword. StringUtil class is part of the  com.brainysoftware.java package that can be found on the accompanying CD. You need to copy  the StringUtil.java file into the com brainysoftware java  directory under the directory where you  put your source files. See Chapter 3 for more information on how to use the StringUtil class.   You compose the SQL statement using the following code:      116      String sql =     "SELECT Id, FirstName, LastName, UserName, Password" +     " FROM Users" +     " WHERE FirstName LIKE '%" +     StringUtil.fixSqlFieldValue keyword  + "%'" +     " OR LastName LIKE '%" +   Once the SQL statement is executed, the returned ResultSet can be looped through to get its cell  data. Of particular interest is the call to the getString method passing the integer 1. This returns the  Id for that person. The Id is important because it is used as the token for that person. The Id is  passed in the URL to the DeleteServlet as well as to the UpdateServlet, as follows:   out.println " <A HREF=DeleteServlet?id=" + id +     ">Delete  " ;   out.println " <A HREF=UpdateServlet?id=" + id +     ">Update  " ;   Therefore, for a person with an Id of 6, the hyperlink to the DeleteServlet will be:    Delete    And for a person with an Id of 8, the hyperlink to the UpdateServlet is    Delete    See how information has been added to the URL?

  After you get the id, an SQL statement can be composed, as follows:   String sql = "DELETE FROM Users WHERE Id=" + id;   Next, you can create a Connection object and a Statement object, and use the latter to execute the  SQL statement:   Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:odbc:JavaWeb" ;   Statement s = con.createStatement  ;   recordAffected = s.executeUpdate sql ;   The code for the DeleteServlet is given in Listing 5.4. Note that in the DeleteServlet, and in the  UpdateServlet, there is no code for loading the JDBC driver. This has been done in the  SearchServlets and the driver stays on for other servlets that need to connect to the same database.   Listing 5.4 The DeleteServlet   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;   import java.util.*;   import java.sql.*;       public class DeleteServlet extends HttpServlet {     **Process the HTTP Get request*      public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response  throws   ServletException, IOException {      int recordAffected = 0;       try {        String id = request.getParameter "id" ;         String sql = "DELETE FROM Users WHERE Id=" + id;         Connection con =           DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:odbc:JavaWeb" ;           Statement s = con.createStatement  ;         recordAffected = s.executeUpdate sql ;         s.close  ;         con.close  ;       }       catch  SQLException e  {      }       catch  Exception e  {      }       response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Deleting A Record " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       if  recordAffected == 1        120            out.println " Record deleted. " ;       else         out.println " Error deleting record. " ;       out.println " Go back  to the Search  page" ;     }   }   The UpdateServlet gets the id passed in the URL and sends a form containing the user details of  the person with that id. The user can update the first name, the last name, or the password for that  person, but not the user name. Therefore, the first name, last name, and the password are  represented in text boxes, whereas the user name is displayed as HTML text.   The business rule for this servlet states that the user name cannot be changed because it's been  guaranteed unique at the time of data insertion. Allowing this value to change can break this  restriction. Of course, how you implement a servlet depends on your own requirement and  business rules. The UpdateServlet is called by clicking the URL in the SearchServlet. The URL  always carries an id for the person whose details are to be changed. This request invokes the  UpdateServlet's doGet method that sends the page header, the update form, and the page footer.  The doGet method is presented in Listing 5.5.   Listing 5.5 The doGet Method of the UpdateServlet   public void doGet HttpServletRequest request,     HttpServletResponse response      throws ServletException, IOException {      sendPageHeader response ;       sendUpdateForm request, response ;       sendPageFooter response ;     }   sendUpdateForm first retrieves the id from the URL using the getParameter method, as follows:   String id = request.getParameter "id" ;   The method then connects to the database to retrieve the details from the Users table. The SQL  statement for that is simply the following:   SELECT FirstName, LastName, UserName, Password   FROM Users   WHERE Id=id   Then the method will send the details in an HTML form, similar to the one shown earlier in Figure  5.3.   The interesting part of the code is when the   tag is sent:   out.println " <FORM METHOD=POST ACTION=" +     request.getRequestURI   + "?id=" + id + ">" ;   Normally, you won't have an ACTION attribute in your form because the form is to be submitted  to the same servlet. This time, however, you need to append the value of the id to the URL.  Therefore, you use the getRequestURI method to get the current Uniform Resource Identifier   URI  and append the following information, such as   ?id=6      121      for the user with an id of 6.   When the user submits the form, the doPost method of the UpdateServlet will be invoked. The  doPost method is given in Listing 5.6.   Listing 5.6 The doPost Method of the UpdateServlet   public void doPost HttpServletRequest request,     HttpServletResponse response      throws ServletException, IOException {      sendPageHeader response ;     updateRecord request, response ;     sendPageFooter response ;   }   The important method called from doPost is the updateRecord method. The updateRecord method  first retrieves the values of id, firstName, lastName, and password using the getParameter method.  Note that the id is retrieved from the URL and the others from the request body, as follows:   String id = request.getParameter "id" ;   String firstName = request.getParameter "firstName" ;   String lastName = request.getParameter "lastName" ;   String password = request.getParameter "password" ;   With these values, you can compose the SQL that will update the record. It has the following  syntax:   UPDATE Users   SET FirstName=firstName,   LastName=lastName,   Password=password   WHERE Id=id   Then you can execute the SQL as usual:   Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection dbUrl ;   Statement s = con.createStatement  ;   int i = s.executeUpdate sql ;   Now, the executeUpdate should return the number of records affected by the SQL statement.  Because the id is unique, it should return 1 as the number of records affected. If it is 1, you simply  send a message saying, "Record updated". If it is not 1 because an unexpected error occurred, say,  "Error updating record".   if  i == 1      out.println "Record updated" ;   else     out.println "Error updating record" ;   The complete code for the UpdateServlet is given in Listing 5.7.

      }       out.println " Go back  to the Search  Page" ;     }   }    Hidden Fields   Another technique for managing user sessions is by passing a token as the value for an HTML  hidden field. Unlike the URL rewriting, the value does not show on the URL but can still be read  by viewing the HTML source code. Although this method also is easy to use, an HTML form is  always required.   Using Hidden Fields   As the first example to illustrate the use of this technique, you will modify the sendUpdateForm  method in the UpdateServlet in Listing 5.7. To try this example, you need to change the  sendUpdateForm method in the UpdateServlet. This servlet should still be used with the  SearchServlet and the DeleteServlet, given in Listings 5.3 and 5.4. The two servlets are not  modified, and the code won't be repeated here.   The new sendUpdateForm method is given in Listing 5.8.   Listing 5.8 The Modified sendUpdateForm Method in UpdateServlet      125      private void sendUpdateForm HttpServletRequest request,  HttpServletResponse response        throws IOException {      String id = request.getParameter "id" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println "  Update Form " ;       out.println " Please edit the first name, last name or  password." ;       out.println " " ;       try {        String sql = "SELECT FirstName, LastName," +           " UserName, Password" +           " FROM Users" +           " WHERE Id=" + id;         Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection dbUrl ;         Statement s = con.createStatement  ;         ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery sql ;         if  rs.next    {          String firstName = rs.getString 1 ;           String lastName = rs.getString 2 ;           String userName = rs.getString 3 ;           String password = rs.getString 4 ;             out.println "  " ;           out.print " " ;           out.println " " ;           out.println " " ;           out.println " First Name " ;           out.print " <INPUT TYPE=TEXT Name=firstName" ;           out.print " VALUE=\"" + StringUtil.encodeHtmlTag firstName  +  "\"" ;           out.println "> " ;           out.println " " ;           out.println " " ;           out.println " Last Name " ;           out.print " <INPUT TYPE=TEXT Name=lastName" ;           out.print " VALUE=\"" + StringUtil.encodeHtmlTag lastName  +  "\"" ;             out.println "> " ;           out.println " " ;           out.println " " ;           out.println " User Name " ;           out.print " " + StringUtil.encodeHtmlTag userName  +  " " ;           out.println " " ;           out.println " " ;           out.println " Password " ;           out.print " <INPUT TYPE=PASSWORD Name=password" ;           out.print " VALUE=\"" + StringUtil.encodeHtmlTag password  +  "\"" ;           out.println "> " ;           out.println " " ;           out.println " " ;           out.println "   " ;           out.println "   " ;           out.println " " ;           out.println " " ;           out.println " " ;         }         s.close  ;         con.close  ;       126          }       catch  SQLException e  {        out.println e.toString   ;       }       catch  Exception e  {        out.println e.toString   ;       }     }   If you run this application in a web browser, you will be able to see that the id is not appended to  the URL. Therefore, you don't need the ACTION attribute in the form. The id is now written to a  HIDDEN field as follows:   out.print " " ;   When the form is submitted, the hidden field is sent along with the other input elements' values of  the form. On the servlet, the id still can be retrieved using the getParameter method.   Splitting Forms   The second example of the use of the hidden field occurs when you want to split a large form into  several smaller ones for the sake of user-friendliness. Again, for this example, you will use the  now familiar Users table. You will write an application that the user can use to insert a new record  to the Users table, similar to the one in Chapter 4. Instead of having one form in which the user  can enter the first name, the last name, the user name, and the password at the same time, however,  the form is split into two smaller forms. The first form will accept the first name and the last name.  The user name and password can be entered on the second form. When the second form is  submitted, all four values must be sent to a third servlet that composes and executes an SQL insert  statement.   In this example, you will use three servlets for each page in the process. They are simply called  Page1Servlet, Page2Servlet, and Page3Servlet. Page1Servlet does not do much except send an  HTML form with two text fields. You can replace this servlet with a static HTML file if you want.  Page1Servlet is shown in Figure 5.4.   Figure 5.4. Page 1.      127      When the form sent by Page1Servlet is submitted, it goes to Page2Servlet. Page2Servlet sends the  second form as well as the values from the first form. It is shown in Figure 5.5.   Figure 5.5. Page 2.   When the second form is submitted, all four values go to Page3Servlet. You could insert a new  record to the database. For brevity, however, you will simply display the values without trying to  access any database. The result from the Page3Servlet is shown in Figure 5.6.      128                                                                                                                   Team-FlyÂ®       Figure 5.6. Page 3.      As mentioned, Page1Servlet is a simple HTML form. It is given in Listing 5.9.   Now, let's dissect the code.   Listing 5.9 Page1Servlet   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;   import java.util.*;     public class Page1Servlet extends HttpServlet {     **Process the HTTP Get request*      public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response  throws   ServletException, IOException {      sendPage1 response ;  }        **Process the HTTP Post request*      public void doPost HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response  throws   ServletException, IOException {      sendPage1 response ;     }       void sendPage1 HttpServletResponse response        throws ServletException, IOException {      response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Page 1 " ;       129          out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Page 1 " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println "Please enter your first first name and last name." ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " First Name&nbsp; " ;       out.println "   " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Last Name&nbsp; " ;       out.println "   " ;         out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println "   " ;       out.println "   " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;     }   }   One thing to note is that you use the ACTION attribute for the form, as you see here:   out.println " " ;   The value for the ACTION attribute is Page2Servlet, which makes sure that the form will be  submitted to Page2Servlet.   Page2Servlet retrieves the first name and last name from the form in Page1Servlet and retains  them in hidden fields. These hidden fields are included in a form that also sends the two text input  for user name and password. The code for this servlet is given in Listing 5.10.

Using more than one servlet is probably the last thing you want to do for a simple application,      133      considering the maintenance involved for each servlet. This example shows the same application  using only one servlet.   The problem with using one servlet is that each form will submit to the same servlet and the same  doPost method will be invoked. How do you know which form to display next? The solution is  simply done by incorporating a hidden field called page with a value of the form number. In the  first form, the page field will have the value of 1, and in the second form this field will have the  value of 2.   When the servlet is first called, the doGet method is invoked. What it does is very predictable:  send the first form to the browser using the sendPage1 method:   sendPage1 response ;   When the first form is submitted, it will invoke the doPost method because the form uses the  POST method. The doPost method will retrieve the value of the parameter called page using the  getParameter method. It should always find a value. However, if for some reason it does not, the  method simply sends the first form and returns, as you see here:   String page = request.getParameter "page" ;   if  page == null  {    sendPage1 response ;     return;   }   If a value for page is found, it could be 1 or 2. If 1 is returned, the previous request is from the first  page; therefore Page 2 should be sent. The request that submits the first form must be  accompanied by the parameters firstName and lastName, however. In other words, both the  getParameter "firstName"  and getParameter "lastName"  must not return null. The values  themselves could be blank strings, as is the case if the user does not type anything in the text  boxes. However, a valid request from the first page must carry these parameters:   if  page.equals "1"   {    if  firstName == null  lastName == null        sendPage1 response ;     else       sendPage2 response ;   }   If either firstName or lastName is not found, the sendPage1 is called again because the request is  not valid.   If the first page is okay, the doPost method calls the sendPage2 method, which sends the second  form as well as the previous values from the first form.   If the value for page is 2, the previous page must come from the second page and four parameters  must be present in the request: firstName, lastName, userName, and password. Missing one of the  values is a sufficient reason to resend the first page, as shown here:   else if  page.equals "2"   {    if  firstName == null  lastName == null        userName == null  password == null        sendPage1 response ;     else       displayValues response ;   }      134      If the value for page is 2 and all the other values are found, the displayValues method is called and  it displays all the four values from the first and second forms.

A cookie is a  small piece of information that is passed back and forth in the HTTP request and response. Even  though a cookie can be created on the client side using some scripting language such as JavaScript,  it is usually created by a server resource, such as a servlet. The cookie sent by a servlet to the  client will be passed back to the server when the client requests another page from the same  application.   Cookies were first specified by Netscape  see  http:  home.netscape.com newsref std cookie_spec.html  and are now part of the Internet standard  as specified in RFC 2109: The HTTP State Management Mechanism. Cookies are transferred to  and from the client in the HTTP headers.   In servlet programming, a cookie is represented by the Cookie class in the javax.servlet.http  package. You can create a cookie by calling the Cookie class constructor and passing two String  objects: the name and value of the cookie. For instance, the following code creates a cookie object  called c1. The cookie has the name "myCookie" and a value of "secret":   Cookie c1 = new Cookie "myCookie", "secret" ;   You then can add the cookie to the HTTP response using the addCookie method of the  HttpServletResponse interface:   response.addCookie c1 ;   Note that because cookies are carried in the request and response headers, you must not add a  cookie after an output has been written to the HttpServletResponse object. Otherwise, an  exception will be thrown.   The following example shows how you can create two cookies called userName and password and  illustrates how those cookies are transferred back to the server. The servlet is called CookieServlet,  and its code is given in Listing 5.13.   When it is first invoked, the doGet method of the servlet is called. The method creates two cookies  and adds both to the HttpServletResponse object, as follows:   Cookie c1 = new Cookie "userName", "Helen" ;   Cookie c2 = new Cookie "password", "Keppler" ;   response.addCookie c1 ;   response.addCookie c2 ;   Next, the doGet method sends an HTML form that the user can click to send another request to the  servlet:   response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Cookie Test " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println "Please click the button to see the cookies sent to  you." ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       138                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®           out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;   The form does not have any element other than a submit button. When the form is submitted, the  doPost method is invoked. The doPost method does two things: It iterates all the headers in the  request to show how the cookies are conveyed back to the server, and it retrieves the cookies and  displays their values.   To display all the headers in the HttpServletRequest method, it first retrieves an Enumeration  object containing all the header names. The method then iterates the Enumeration object to get the  next header name and passes the header name to the getHeader method to display the value of that  header, as you see here:   Enumeration enum = request.getHeaderNames  ;   while  enum.hasMoreElements    {    String header =  String  enum.nextElement  ;     out.print " " + header + " : " ;     out.print request.getHeader header  + " " ;   }   To retrieve cookies, you use the getCookies method of the HttpServletRequest interface. This  method returns a Cookie array containing all cookies in the request. It is your responsibility to  loop through the array to get the cookie you want, as follows:   Cookie[] cookies = request.getCookies  ;   int length = cookies.length;   for  int i=0; i<length; i++  {    Cookie cookie = cookies[i];     out.println " Cookie Name:  " +       cookie.getName   + " " ;     out.println " Cookie Value:  " +       cookie.getValue   + " " ;   }   The headers and cookies are displayed in Figure 5.7.   Figure 5.7. The headers containing cookies and the cookies' values.      139         Listing 5.13 Sending and Receiving Cookies   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;   import java.util.*;     public class CookieServlet extends HttpServlet {       **Process the HTTP Get request*      public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response        throws ServletException, IOException {        Cookie c1 = new Cookie "userName", "Helen" ;       Cookie c2 = new Cookie "password", "Keppler" ;       response.addCookie c1 ;       response.addCookie c2 ;         response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Cookie Test " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println "Please click the button to see the cookies sent to  you." ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;     }      **Process the HTTP Post request*        140        public void doPost HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response  throws ServletException,IOException {      response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Cookie Test " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Here are all the headers. " ;         Enumeration enum = request.getHeaderNames  ;       while  enum.hasMoreElements    {        String header =  String  enum.nextElement  ;         out.print " " + header + " : " ;         out.print request.getHeader header  + " " ;       }         out.println "   And, here are all the cookies. " ;       Cookie[] cookies = request.getCookies  ;       int length = cookies.length;       for  int i=0; i<length; i++  {        Cookie cookie = cookies[i];         out.println " Cookie Name:  " + cookie.getName   + " " ;         out.println " Cookie Value:  " + cookie.getValue   +  " " ;       }        out.println " " ;        out.println " " ;      }   }   Another example of a servlet that uses cookies is a Login servlet that utilizes cookies to carry the  user name and password information. The use of cookies is more appropriate than both URL  rewriting and hidden values. First, unlike URL rewriting, the values of the cookies are not directly  visible  you don't want this sensitive information to be seen by anyone . Second, you don't need to  use any form, which is the requirement of using hidden fields.   Using cookes has a disadvantage, however: The user can choose not to accept them. Even though  browsers leave the factories with the cookie setting on, any user can  accidentally  change this  setting. The normal practice is therefore to use cookies with warnings to the user if the application  does not work as expected. The warning could be a simple message telling the user to activate his  cookie setting, or it could be a hyperlink to a page that thoroughly describes how to set the cookie  setting in various browsers.   So, here it is: the CookieLoginServlet that modifies the previous LoginServlet in Chapter 4. The  complete code is given in Listing 5.14. If the cookie setting is not on, the servlet will send a  message. The servlet also will send a message if the authentication fails  see Figure 5.8 .   Figure 5.8. CookieLoginServlet.bmp.      141         An important part of the listing that deserves an explanation is the part that redirects the user to  another resource when the login is successful. First, you need to create two cookies called  userName and password and add them to the HttpServletResponse object. The cookies will always  go back to the server when the user gets redirected to another resource. This resource can then  retrieve the cookies and do the authentication again against the same database. This way, the user  does not have to log in more than once.   Next, you need the code that redirects the user. Normally, to redirect a user, you would use the  sendRedirect method. When you need to send cookies at the same time, however, redirecting  using the sendRedirect method will not make the cookies get passed back to the server. As an  alternative, you use a META tag of the following syntax:       This META tag will make the browser request another resource as indicated in the URL part. x  indicates the number of seconds the browser will wait before the redirection occurs.   The code that does these two things is given here:       if  login userName, password   {          send cookie to the browser         Cookie c1 = new Cookie "userName", userName ;         Cookie c2 = new Cookie "password", password ;         response.addCookie c1 ;         response.addCookie c2 ;         response.setContentType "text html" ;         PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;           response.sendRedirect does not work here.            use a Meta tag to redirect to ContentServlet         out.println   " " ;       }      142      Listing 5.14 CookieLoginServlet   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;   import java.util.*;   import java.sql.*;   import com.brainysoftware.java.StringUtil;     public class CookieLoginServlet extends HttpServlet {      public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response  throws ServletException, IOException {      sendLoginForm response, false ;     }       public void doPost HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response  throws ServletException, IOException {        String userName = request.getParameter "userName" ;       String password = request.getParameter "password" ;       if  login userName, password   {          send cookie to the browser         Cookie c1 = new Cookie "userName", userName ;         Cookie c2 = new Cookie "password", password ;         response.addCookie c1 ;         response.addCookie c2 ;         response.setContentType "text html" ;         PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;           response.sendRedirect does not work here.            use a Meta tag to redirect to ContentServlet           out.println "<META HTTP-EQUIV=Refresh  CONTENT=0;URL=ContentServlet>" ;       }       else {        sendLoginForm response, true ;       }     }       private void sendLoginForm HttpServletResponse response, boolean  withErrorMessage        throws ServletException, IOException {      response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Login " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;         if  withErrorMessage  {        out.println "Login failed.

A servlet called ContentServlet is created to  demonstrate this. The CookieLoginServlet will redirect the user to this servlet upon a successful  login. The ContentServlet is given in Listing 5.15.   Listing 5.15 ContentServlet   response  throws ServletException, IOException {   import javax.servlet.*;  import javax.servlet.http.*;  import java.io.*;  import java.util.*;    public class ContentServlet extends HttpServlet {    public String loginUrl = "CookieLoginServlet";       **Process the HTTP Get request*     public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse      String userName = null;      String password = null;      Cookie[] cookies = request.getCookies  ;        if  cookies != null  {        int length = cookies.length;        for  int i=0; i<length; i++  {          Cookie cookie = cookies[i];          if  cookie.getName  .equals "userName"              userName = cookie.getValue  ;          else if  cookie.getName  .equals "password"              password = cookie.getValue  ;        }      }        if  userName == null  password == null        response.sendRedirect loginUrl ;      }           This is an authorized user, okay to display content      response.setContentType "text html" ;      PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;      out.println " " ;      out.println " " ;      out.println " Welcome " ;      out.println " " ;      out.println " " ;      out.println "Welcome." ;      out.println " " ;      out.println " " ;    }       **Process the HTTP Post request*     public void doPost HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse      doGet request, response ;    }  }    !CookieLoginServlet.login userName, password   {   response  throws ServletException, IOException {   After studying the previous example, you might wonder why you need to create two cookies that  hold the value for the user name and password, respectively. Can't you just use a cookie that      145      contains the value of true to indicate a previous successful login? The ContentServlet can just find  this cookie and doesn't have to authenticate the user name and password again, hence saving a  database manipulation.   This might sound better; however, a clever user can create a cookie at the client side. Knowing  that a successful cookie carries a special flag, the user can create the cookie and get authenticated  without having to know a valid user name and password.   Anticipating a Failed Redirection   When you need to do redirection while using cookies for managing user sessionsâeven when  everything looks perfectâa redirection might fail. In the code that is supposed to redirect the user,  you should provide a link that the user can manually click should the automatic redirection fail.   Note   Persisting Cookies   If you are testing a cookie and find that the code does not work as expected, close your  browser to delete the cookie.   The cookies you created in the previous example last as long as the browser is open. When the  browser is closed, the cookies are deleted. You can choose to persist cookies so that they last  longer. The javax.servlet.http.Cookie class has the setMaxAge method that sets the maximum age  of the cookie in seconds.   In the next example, you will create a Login servlet that uses a cookie that persists for 10,000  seconds. If the user closes the browser but comes back within 10,000 seconds, he or she does not  have to enter a user name again. Figure 5.9 shows the Login page in which the user name has been  supplied by the server.   Figure 5.9.

What this method does is browse through the Cookie collection  obtained from the getCookies   method of the javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse interface.  For each Cookie, the code tests whether the cookie name is "userName". If it is, the cookie value  is assigned to the persistentUserName field as follows:   Cookie[] cookies = request.getCookies  ;   int length = cookies.length;   for  int i=0; i<length; i++  {    Cookie cookie = cookies[i];     if  cookie.getName  .equals "userName"         persistedUserName = cookie.getValue  ;   }   Then, the doGet method calls the sendLoginForm method to send the Login form that the user can  use to log in:   sendLoginForm response, false ;      149      When the user submits the Login form, the doPost method in the PersistentCookieServlet is  invoked. The doPost method first tries to retrieve the userName and password values entered by  the user, as you see here:   String userName = request.getParameter "userName" ;   String password = request.getParameter "password" ;   It then sends the userName and password values to the login method. This method will return true  if the userName and password are valid. Upon successful login, two cookies, c1 and c2, will be  created. c1 is called userName, and c2 is named password:   if  login userName, password   {      send cookie to the browser     Cookie c1 = new Cookie "userName", userName ;     Cookie c2 = new Cookie "password", password ;   The c1 cookie is set to last for 10,000 seconds using the setMaxAge method, as follows:   c1.setMaxAge 10000 ;   Then, the doPost method sends both c1 and c2 to the browser and redirects the browser to another  servlet, as the following code shows:   response.addCookie c1 ;   response.addCookie c2 ;   response.setContentType "text html" ;   PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;     response.sendRedirect does not work here.      use a Meta tag to redirect to ContentServlet   out.println     " " ;   If the user comes back within 10,000 seconds, the browser will send the userName cookie back to  the server and the cookie will be found in the doGet method.   The login method called from the doPost method sets up a database connection and sends the  following SQL statement:   SELECT UserName FROM Users   WHERE UserName='userName'   AND Password='password'   If the SQL statement execution returns a non-empty ResultSet object, a user account by that name  and password is found and the login method returns true:   public static boolean login String userName, String password  {      try {        Class.forName "sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver" ;         Connection con =  DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:odbc:JavaWeb" ;         Statement s = con.createStatement  ;         String sql = "SELECT UserName FROM Users" +           " WHERE UserName='" + StringUtil.fixSqlFieldValue userName  +  "'" +           " AND Password='" + StringUtil.fixSqlFieldValue password  +  "'";         ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery sql ;       150              if  rs.next    {          rs.close  ;           s.close  ;           con.close  ;           return true;         }         rs.close  ;         s.close  ;         con.close  ;       }       catch  ClassNotFoundException e  {        System.out.println e.toString   ;       }       catch  SQLException e  {        System.out.println e.toString   ;       }       catch  Exception e  {        System.out.println e.toString   ;       }       return false;     }   }   Checking Whether Cookie Setting Is On   All the cookie-related examples assume that the user browser's cookie setting is on. Even though  browsers leave the factory with this setting on, the user can turn this off. One approach to solving  this problem is to send a warning message if the application does not work as expected. The other  option is to check this setting automatically. This option can be explained with an example of a  servlet called CheckCookieServlet.   What the servlet does is simple enough. It sends a response that forces the browser to come back  for the second time. With the first response, it sends a cookie. When the browser comes back for  the second time, the servlet checks whether the request carries the cookie sent previously. If the  cookie is there, it can be concluded that the browser setting for cookies is on. Otherwise, it could  be that the user is using a very old browser that does not recognize cookies at all, or the cookie  support for that browser is off.   The CheckCookieServlet is given in Listing 5.17.   Listing 5.17 CheckCookieServlet   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;   import java.util.*;     public class CheckCookieServlet extends HttpServlet {     **Process the HTTP Get request*      public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response  throws ServletException, IOException {      response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       if  request.getParameter "flag"  == null  {           the first request         Cookie cookie = new Cookie "browserSetting", "on" ;         response.addCookie cookie ;       151            String nextUrl = request.getRequestURI   + "?flag=1";         out.println "<META HTTP-EQUIV=Refresh CONTENT=0;URL="+ nextUrl  +">" ;       }       else {           the second request         Cookie[] cookies = request.getCookies  ;         if  cookies != null   {        int length = cookies.length;         boolean cookieFound = false;         for  int i=0; i<length; i++  {          Cookie cookie = cookies[i];           if  cookie.getName  .equals "browserSetting"  &&             cookie.getValue  .equals "on"   {            cookieFound = true;             break;           }         }         if  cookieFound  {          out.println "Your browser's cookie setting is on." ;         }         else {          out.println "Your browser does not support cookies or" +             " the cookie setting is off." ;         }       }     }      **Process the HTTP Post request*      public void doPost HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse   response  throws ServletException, IOException {      doGet request, response ;     }   }    Session Objects   Of the four techniques for session management covered in this chapter, the Session object,  represented by the javax.servlet.http.HttpSession interface, is the easiest to use and the most  powerful. For each user, the servlet can create an HttpSession object that is associated with that  user only and can only be accessed by that particular user. The HttpSession object acts like a  Hashtable into which you can store any number of key object pairs. The HttpSession object is  accessible from other servlets in the same application. To retrieve an object previously stored, you  need only to pass the key.   An HttpSession object uses a cookie or URL rewriting to send a token to the client. If cookies are  used to convey session identifiers, the client browsers are required to accept cookies.   Unlike previous techniques, however, the server does not send any value. What it sends is simply  a unique number called the session identifier. This session identifier is used to associate a user  with a Session object in the server. Therefore, if there are 10 simultaneous users, 10 Session  objects will be created in the server and each user can access only his or her own HttpSession  object.   The way an HttpSession object is created for a user and retrieved in the next requests is illustrated  in Figure 5.10.      152      Figure 5.10. How session tracking works with the HttpSession object.      Figure 5.10 shows that there are four steps in session tracking using the HttpSession object:   1.  An HttpSession object is created by a servlet called Servlet1. A session identifier is   generated for this HttpSession object. In this example, the session identifier is 1234, but  in reality, the servlet container will generate a longer random number that is guaranteed to  be unique. The HttpSession object then is stored in the server and is associated with the  generated session identifier. Also the programmer can store values immediately after  creating an HttpSession.  In the response, the servlet sends the session identifier to the client browser.   2.  3.  When the client browser requests another resource in the same application, such as   Servlet2, the session identifier is sent back to the server and passed to Servlet2 in the  javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest object.   4.  For Servlet2 to have access to the HttpSession object for this particular client, it uses the   getSession method of the javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest interface. This method  automatically retrieves the session identifier from the request and obtains the HttpSession  object associated with the session identifier.   Note   What if the user never comes back after an HttpSession object is created? Then the servlet  container waits for a certain period of time and removes that HttpSession object. One  worry about using Session objects is scalability. In some servlet containers, Session  objects are stored in memory, and as the number of users exceeds a certain limit, the  server eventually runs out of memory.   One solution to this memory problem when using Session objects is to save Session  objects to the database or disk. However, the Servlet 2.3 Specification does not clearly  state how a servlet container should do this. If you are using Tomcat 4, however, your  Session objects will be moved to secondary storage once the number of Session objects  has exceeded some value.   The getSession method of the javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest interface has two overloads.  They are as follows:      HttpSession getSession       HttpSession getSession boolean create       153      The first overload returns the current session associated with this request, or if the request does not  have a session identifier, it creates a new one.   The second overload returns the HttpSession object associated with this request if there is a valid  session identifier in the request. If no valid session identifier is found in the request, whether a  new HttpSession object is created depends on the create value. If the value is true, a new  HttpSession object is created if no valid session identifier is found in the request. Otherwise, the  getSession method will return null.   Now that you know how session management works using the HttpSession object, let's have a  look at the javax.servlet.http.HttpSession interface in more detail.   The javax.servlet.http.HttpSession Interface   This interface has the following methods:   getAttribute  getAttributeNames  getCreationTime  getId  getLastAccessedTime  getMaxInactiveInterval  getServletContext  getSessionContext  getValue  getValueNames  invalidate  isNew  putValue  removeAttribute  removeValue  setAttribute  setMaxInactiveInterval                                                          Each of the methods is discussed below.   getAttribute   This method retrieves an attribute from the HttpSession object. The return value is an object of  type Object; therefore you may have to downcast the attribute to its original type. To retrieve an  attribute, you pass the name associated with the attribute. This method returns an  IllegalStateException if it is called upon an invalidated HttpSession object.   The signature for this method is as follows:   public Object getAttribute String name  throws IllegalStateException   getAttributeNames   The signature is as follows:   The getAttributeNames method returns a java.util.Enumeration containing all attribute names in  the HttpSession object. This method returns an IllegalStateException if it is called upon an  invalidated HttpSession object.   154      getId   public java.util.Enumeration getAttributeNames   throws  IllegalStateException   getCreationTime   The getCreationTime method returns the time that the HttpSession object was created, in  milliseconds since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT. This method returns an IllegalStateException  if it is called upon an invalidated HttpSession object.   The signature for this method is as follows:   public long getCreationTime   throws IllegalStateException   The getID method returns the session identifier. The signature for this method is as follows:   public String getId     getLastAccessedTime   The getLastAccessedTime method returns the time the HttpSession object was last accessed by  the client. The return value is the number of milliseconds lapsed since since January 1, 1970  00:00:00 GMT. The following is the method signature:   public long getLastAccessedTime     getMaxInactiveInterval   The getMaxInactiveInterval method returns the number of seconds the HttpSession object will be  retained by the servlet container after it is last accessed before being removed. The signature of  this method is as follows:   public int getMaxInactiveInterval     getServletContext   The getServletContext method returns the javax.servlet.ServletContext object the HttpSession  object belongs to. The signature is as follows:   public javax.servlet.ServletContext getServletContext   getSessionContext   This method is deprecated.   getValue   This method is deprecated.   getValueNames   This method is deprecated.      155   The invalidate method invalidates the HttpSession object and unbinds any object bound to it. This  method throws an IllegalStateException if this method is called upon an already invalidated  HttpSession object. The signature is as follows:   public void invalidate   throws IllegalStateException   The isNew method indicates whether the HttpSession object was created with this request and the  client has not yet joined the session tracking. This method returns an IllegalStateException if it is  called upon an invalidated HttpSession object.   public boolean isNew   throws IllegalStateException   The removeAttribute method removes an attribute bound to this HttpSession object. This method  returns an IllegalStateException if it is called upon an invalidated HttpSession object.   public void removeAttribute String name  throws IllegalStateException      invalidate   isNew   Its signature is as follows:   putValue   This method is deprecated.   removeAttribute   Its signature is as follows:   removeValue   This method is deprecated.   setAttribute   The setAttribute method adds a name attribute pair to the HttpSession object. This method returns  an IllegalStateException if it is called upon an invalidated HttpSession object. The method has the  following signature:   public void setAttribute String name, Object attribute  throws   IllegalStateException   setMaxInactiveInterval   The setMaxInactiveInterval method sets the number of seconds from the time the HttpSession  object is accessed the servlet container will wait before removing the HttpSession object. The  signature is as follows:   public void setMaxInactiveInterval int interval    Passing a negative number to this method will make this HttpSession object never expire.      156      Using HttpSession Object   The following example modifies the previous Login page and uses HttpSession objects. You don't  need to create two cookies for both the user name and password. Because only the server can store  and retrieve values from a HttpSession object, you can create a key called loggedIn with the value  of "true" if the user has successfully logged in before.

This means that the client browser must have its cookie support enabled.  Therefore, you need to perform browser cookie testing as explained in the previous section,  "Checking Whether Cookie Setting Is On."   Alternatively, you can avoid the use of cookies by sending session identifiers in the URL using the  URL-rewriting technique. Fortunately, the Servlet API provides an easy way to append session  identifier to the URLâusing the encodeURL method of the  javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse interface.      159      To use the URL-rewriting technique, pass any URL referenced to in a servlet into the encodeURL  method of the javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse interface. For example, the following code:   out.println " Click here " ;   must be changed into the following:   out.println "<a href=" + response.encodeURL "Servlet2"  +     ">Click here " ;   This will add the session identifier to the end of the string, resulting in a URL similar to the  following:   http:  localhost:8080 myApp servlet Servlet2;jsessionid=AB34898928342 9489234At   where the number after jsessionid= is the session identifier.   One disadvantage of using URL rewriting as opposed to cookies in sending your session  identifiers is that URL rewriting does not survive static pages. For example, if the user has to  browse through some HTML page during his or her session, the session identifier will be lost.   The not-so-practical solution is of course to convert all static pages into servlets or JSP pages.    Knowing Which Technique to Use   Having learned the four techniques for managing user sessions, you may be wondering which one  you should choose to implement.   Clearly, using Session objects is the easiest and you should use this if your servlet container  supports swapping Session objects from memory to secondary storage. If you are using Tomcat 4,  this feature is available to you.   One concern when using the Session objects is whether cookie support is enabled in the user  browser. If it is, you have two options:      You can test the cookie support setting by using the technique described in the section   "Checking Whether Cookie Setting Is On."      You can use URL-rewriting.   Appending your session identifier to the URL is a good technique, even though this creates some  additional work for the programmer. However, this relieves you of having to rely on cookies.   Using cookies is not as flexible as using Session objects. However, cookies are the way to go if  you don't want your server to store any client-related information or if you want the client  information to persist when the browser is closed.   Finally, hidden fields are probably the least-often-used technique. If you need to split a form into  several smaller ones, however, using hidden fields is the cheapest and most efficient method. You  don't need to consume server resources to temporarily store the values from the previous forms,  and you don't need to rely on cookies. I would suggest hidden fields over Session objects, URL- rewriting, or cookies in this case.      160        Summary   In this chapter, you have learned that HTTP is a stateless protocol. You also have been shown the  implications of this statelessness. Additionally you learned about four techniques you can use to  manage user sessions. Each technique has been described, and examples have been built to  demonstrate the technique.      161      Chapter 6. Application and Session Events   In Chapter 3, "Writing Servlet Applications," you learned how to use the ServletContext object to  share information among all the servlets in a web application. You also learned how to obtain this  object so that you can use its methods. The ServletContext object is created by the servlet  container, and, among other things, it has a method called setAttribute. That method causes the  object to act like a Hashtable, where you can store an object that is identified by a key and later  retrieve the object by passing the key.   In Chapter 5, "Session Management," you learned how to create and invalidate the HttpSession  object. You also learned how to use an HttpSession object to store user session information.  Similar to the ServletContext object, an Httpsession enables you to store key object pairs. Unlike  the ServletContext, which is accessible by all the servlets, an HttpSession object is linked to a  particular user and is available only to that user.   In this chapter, you see a new feature in the Servlet 2.3 API Specification that has to do with both  the ServletContext and HttpSession objects. This new feature supports application and session- level events. If you use Tomcat 4, this new feature is available to you.   The concept is very simple, so let me provide you an overview.   In relation to the ServletContext object, the Servlet 2.3 API enables you to get notifications when  the ServletContext object is created and destroyed, or when an attribute  a key object pair  is  created, removed, or replaced. The moments these things occur have now become Java events that  you can listen to.   The question is, why would you want to know when these things happen? Surely you can live  without these events; however, they can be very useful because you can write code that gets called  automatically when one of the events happens. For example, you know that the ServletContext  object is created by the servlet container when it initializes. You can therefore do certain things in  response to this event, such as loading a JDBC driver or creating a database connection object. Or,  you probably want to initialize a connection URL and store it as a variable in the ServletContext  object so that it is accessible from all the servlets in the web application.   For events that get triggered when the ServletContext is destroyed, you can write code that does  some cleanup, such as closing files or ending a database connection.   The same applies to events related to ContextServlet's attributes. For example, you can make a  persistent page counter whose value gets written to a file every time the value is changed.  Assuming that you store this counter value as an attribute in the ServletContext object, you can  write some I O code that automatically executes when the ServletContext's attribute gets replaced,  thus allowing for an accurate count.   Additionally, with an HttpSession object, you also can get notified when an HttpSession object is  created or invalidated or when an attribute of a HttpSession object is added, removed, or replaced.   In this chapter, you will see various event classes and listener interfaces that support event  notification for state changes in the ServletContext and the HttpSession objects.    Listening to Application Events      162      At the application level, the javax.servlet package provides two listener interfaces that support  event notifications for state changes in the ServletContext object: the ServletContextListener  interface and the ServletContextAttributesListener interface.   The ServletContextListener Interface   You can use the ServletContextListener interface to listen to the ServletContext life cycle events.  Its signature is given as follows:   public interface ServletContextListener extends  java.util.EventListener   Your listener class must implement this interface to listen to ServletContext life cycle events. The  ServletContextListener interface has two methods: contextInitialized and contextDestroyed. The  signatures for these methods are the following:   public void contextInitialized ServletContextEvent sce    public void contextDestroyed ServletContextEvent sce    The contextInitialized method is called when the web application is ready to service requests. The  method is called automatically by the servlet container when its own initialization process is  finished. You can write code that needs to get executed when the application initializes, such as  loading a JDBC driver, creating a database Connection object, or assigning initialization values to  global variables.   The contextDestroyed method is invoked when the servlet context is about to be shut down. You  can use this method to write code that needs to run when the application shuts down, such as  closing a database connection or writing to the log.   Utilizing the contextInitialized method is similar to writing code in a servlet's init   method, and  the contextDestroyed method has a similar effect as a servlet's destroy   method. However, using  application events make the codes available throughout the whole application, not only from  inside a servlet.   The ServletContextEvent Class   As you have seen, both methods of the ServletContextListener interface pass a  ServletContextEvent class. This class has the following signature:   public class ServletContextEvent extends java.util.EventObject   The ServletContextEvent has only one method: getServletContext. This method returns the  ServletContext that is changed.   To use application events and include a servlet listener class, you must tell the servlet container by  registering the listener class in the deployment descriptor. The   element must contain a    element like the following:   Deployment Descriptor                          AppLifeCycleEvent              163               The   element must come before the   part.   An Example: AppLifeCycleEvent Class   The following is a simple listener class that listens to the life cycle events of the ServletContext. It  simply prints the string "Application initialized" when the ServletContext is initialized and  "Application destroyed" when the ServletContext is destroyed. The code for the program is given  in Listing 6.1.   Listing 6.1 The AppLifeCycleEvent Class   import javax.servlet.ServletContextListener;   import javax.servlet.ServletContextEvent;     public class AppLifeCycleEvent implements ServletContextListener {      public void contextInitialized ServletContextEvent cse  {      System.out.println "Application initialized" ;     }       public void contextDestroyed ServletContextEvent cse  {      System.out.println "Application shut down" ;     }   }   For the AppLifeCycleEvent class to work, you must register it in the deployment descriptor. The  deployment descriptor is given in Listing 6.2.   Listing 6.2 The Deployment Descriptor for the AppLifeCycleEvent Class         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                             AppLifeCycleEvent                     Now, restart Tomcat and watch the console window. You should be able to see the string  "Application initialized" at the console.   If you want, you can have more than one listener class. To do this, list all the listener classes in the  deployment descriptor, as follows:         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">       164                                AppLifeCycleEvent1                                     AppLifeCycleEvent2                     With a deployment descriptor like this, when Tomcat starts, it will call the contextInitialized  method in the AppLifeCycleEvent1 class and then call the same method in the  AppLifeCycleEvent2 class.   Another Example: Loading a JDBC Driver and Setting a ServletContext Attribute   The following example uses the contextInitialized method in the ServletContextListener interface  to load a JDBC driver and set a ServletContext attribute named "dbUrl" with a value of  "jdbc:mysql   Fred". Loading the JDBC driver here makes it available for the next access to the  database.   The example has two classes: a listener class called AppLifeCycleEventDemo and a servlet named  ApplicationEventDemoServlet. The listener class provides a method  contextInitialized  that will  be called automatically when the ServletContext object is initialized. This is where you put the  code that loads the JDBC driver and sets a ServletContext attribute. The servlet is used to display  the attribute value. The AppLifeCycleEventDemo class is given in Listing 6.3, and the  ApplicationEventDemoServlet in Listing 6.4.   Listing 6.3 AppLifeCycleEventDemo   import javax.servlet.ServletContext;   import javax.servlet.ServletContextListener;   import javax.servlet.ServletContextEvent;     public class AppLifeCycleEventDemo implements ServletContextListener  {      public void contextInitialized ServletContextEvent sce  {      System.out.println "Initializing Application â¦" ;          Load the JDBC driver       try {        Class.forName "org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver " ;       }       catch  ClassNotFoundException e  {        System.out.println e.toString   ;       }            Get the ServletContext object       ServletContext servletContext = sce.getServletContext  ;            Set a ServletContext attribute       servletContext.setAttribute "dbUrl", "jdbc:mysql   Fred" ;       System.out.println "Application initialized" ;     }         165        public void contextDestroyed ServletContextEvent cse  {      System.out.println "Application shut down" ;     }   }   Note that before you can set a ServletContext attribute, you first need to obtain the ServletContext  object using the getServletContext method of the ServletContextEvent class. This is shown in the  following line of code from Listing 6.3.   ServletContext servletContext = sce.getServletContext  ;   In the servlet, to get an attribute from the ServletContext object, you need first to obtain the  ServletContext object. In a servlet that extends the javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet class, you can  use the getServletContext method to achieve this, as demonstrated in the code in Listing 6.4.   Listing 6.4 The ApplicationEventDemoServlet Servlet   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;     public class ApplicationEventDemoServlet extends HttpServlet {      public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response  throws ServletException, IOException {      response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Application Event Demo Servlet " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println "Your database connection is " ;            get the ServletContext object       ServletContext servletContext = getServletContext  ;          display the "dbUrl" attribute       out.println servletContext.getAttribute "dbUrl"  ;         out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;     }   }   Listing 6.5 gives you the deployment descriptor you need for the application to work.   Listing 6.5 The Deployment Descriptor for the Example       <!DOCTYPE web-app   PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"   "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                             AppLifeCycleEventDemo                     166                          ApplicationEventDemo                         ApplicationEventDemoServlet                     After you compile both classes, restart Tomcat and direct your browser to the servlet URL. You  should see something similar to Figure 6.1.   Figure 6.1. Obtaining an attribute value set when the application initializes.      Listening to ServletContextAttributeListener   In addition to a life cycle listener, you also can implement the ServletContextAttributeListener  class to be notified when any attribute is added to the ServletContext or if any of the  ServletContext's attributes are changed or removed. Implementing this interface, you must provide  implementations for its three methods: attributeAdded, attributeRemoved, and attributeReplace.  The signatures for those methods are as follows:   public void attributeAdded ServletContextAttributeEvent scae    public void attributeRemoved ServletContextAttributeEvent scae    public void attributeReplaced ServletContextAttributeEvent scae    The attributeAdded method is called when a new attribute is added to the ServletContext object.  The attributeRemove method is called when an attribute is removed from the ServletContext  object, and the attributeReplaced method is invoked when an attribute in the ServletContext object  is replaced.      167      Note that attribute changes may occur concurrently. It is your responsibility to ensure that  accesses to a common resource are synchronized.   Another Example: PageCounterServlet   As another example, consider the following application that provides a page counter for a servlet.  The servlet increments a counter every time it is requested, thus the name page counter. The value  of the counter is stored as an attribute of the ServletContext object so that it can be accessed from  any servlet in the application. However, if the servlet container crashes, you will not lose this  value because the value is also written to a text file called counter.txt. Clearly, this is a type of  application you can use to measure the popularity of your site.   The application consists of two classes. The first is a listener class named  AppAttributeEventDemo and the second is a servlet called PageCounterServlet.   The AppAttributeEventDemo implements both ServletContextListener interface and  ServletContextAttributeListener interface. In the contextInitialized method, you write the code  that will read the counter value from the counter.txt file and use this value to initialize a  ServletContext attribute named pageCounter. As in the previous example, you need to obtain the  ServletContext object from the ServletContextEvent object passed to the contextInitialized method.   Every time the PageCounterServlet servlet is requested, it will increment the value of pageCounter.  When this happens, the attributeReplaced method of the listener class will be triggered. In this  method, you write the code that writes the value of pageCounter to the counter.txt file.   Because the servlet can be called simultaneously by multiple users, the method writeCounter,  called from the attributeReplaced method, is synchronized. Here is where you write the code to  write pageCounter to the file.   The listener class is given in Listing 6.6 and the PageCounterServlet in Listing 6.7.

Listing 6.8 The Deployment Descriptor for the PageCounter Example         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                             AppAttributeEventDemo                                     PageCounter                         PageCounterServlet                     Note that the attributeReplaced also is called when the attributeAdded is triggered.    Listening to HttpSession Events   The javax.servlet.http package provides two interfaces that you can implement to listen to  HttpSession events: HttpSessionListener and HttpSessionAttributeListener. The first enables you  to listen to a session's life cycle events, that is, the event that gets triggered when an HttpSession  object is created and the event that is raised when an HttpSession object is destroyed. The second  interface, HttpSessionAttributeListener, provides events that get raised when an attribute is added  to, removed from, or modified in the HttpSession object.   The two interfaces are explained next.   The HttpSessionListener Interface   The HttpSessionListener interface has two methods: sessionCreated and sessionDestroyed. The  signatures of the two methods are given here:   public void sessionCreated HttpSessionEvent se    public void sessionDestroyed HttpSessionEvent se       171      The sessionCreated method is automatically called when an HttpSession object is created. The  sessionDestroyed method is called when an HttpSession object is invalidated. Both methods will  be passed in an HttpSessionEvent class that you can use from inside the method.   The HttpSessionEvent class is derived from the java.util.EventObject class. The HttpSessionEvent  class defines one new method called getSesssion that you can use to obtain the HttpSession object  that is changed.   An Example: User Counter   The following example is a counter that counts the number of different users currently "in  session." It creates an HttpSession object for a user the first time the user requests the servlet. If  the user comes back to the same servlet, no HttpSession object will be created the second time.  Therefore, the counter is incremented only when an HttpSession object is created.   An HttpSession object can also be destroyed, however. When this happens, the counter must be  decremented. For the counter to be accessible to all users, it is stored as an attribute in the  ServletContext object.   The example has two classes: the listener class and a servlet class that displays the counter value.  The listener class is named SessionLifeCycleEventDemo and implements both the  ServletContextListener interface and the HttpSessionListener interface. You need the first  interface so that you can create a ServletContext attribute and assign it an initial value of 0. As  you can guess, you put this code in the contextInitialized method, as in the following:   public void contextInitialized ServletContextEvent sce  {    servletContext = sce.getServletContext  ;     servletContext.setAttribute  "userCounter" ,  Integer.toString counter  ;   }   Notice that the ServletContext object is assigned to a class variable servletContext, making the  ServletContext object available from anywhere in the class.   The counter must be incremented when an HttpSession is created and decremented when an  HttpSession is destroyed. Therefore, you need to provide implementations for both sessionCreated  and sessionDestroyed methods, as you see here:   public void sessionCreated HttpSessionEvent hse  {    System.out.println "Session created." ;     incrementUserCounter  ;   }     public void sessionDestroyed HttpSessionEvent hse  {    System.out.println "Session destroyed." ;     decrementUserCounter  ;   }   The sessionCreated method calls the synchronized method incrementUserCounter and the  sessionDestroyed method calls the synchronized method decrementUserCounter.   The incrementUserCounter method first obtains an attribute called userCounter from the  ServletContext object, increments the counter, and stores the counter back to the userCounter  attribute.   synchronized void incrementUserCounter   {      172        counter = Integer.parseInt        String servletContext.getAttribute "userCounter"  ;     counter++;     servletContext.setAttribute  "userCounter" ,  Integer.toString counter  ;     System.out.println "User Count: " + counter ;   }   The decrementUserCounter method does the opposite. It first obtains the userCounter attribute  from the ServletContext object, decrements the counter, and stores the counter back to the  userCounter attribute, as you see here:   synchronized void decrementUserCounter   {    int counter = Integer.parseInt        String servletContext.getAttribute "userCounter"  ;     counterââ;     servletContext.setAttribute  "userCounter" ,  Integer.toString counter  ;     System.out.println "User Count: " + counter ;   }   The listener class is given in Listing 6.9.   Listing 6.9 The SessionLifeCycleEventDemo Class   import javax.servlet.http.HttpSession;   import javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionListener;   import javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionEvent;   import javax.servlet.ServletContextListener;   import javax.servlet.ServletContext;   import javax.servlet.ServletContextEvent;     public class SessionLifeCycleEventDemo     implements ServletContextListener, HttpSessionListener {    ServletContext servletContext;     int counter;     public void contextInitialized ServletContextEvent sce  {      servletContext = sce.getServletContext  ;       servletContext.setAttribute  "userCounter" ,  Integer.toString counter  ;     }       public void contextDestroyed ServletContextEvent sce  {    }       public void sessionCreated HttpSessionEvent hse  {      System.out.println "Session created." ;       incrementUserCounter  ;     }     public void sessionDestroyed HttpSessionEvent hse  {      System.out.println "Session destroyed." ;       decrementUserCounter  ;     }       synchronized void incrementUserCounter   {      counter = Integer.parseInt          String servletContext.getAttribute "userCounter"  ;       counter++;       servletContext.setAttribute  "userCounter" ,  Integer.toString counter  ;       System.out.println "User Count: " + counter ;       173        }       synchronized void decrementUserCounter   {      int counter = Integer.parseInt          String servletContext.getAttribute "userCounter"  ;       counterâ;       servletContext.setAttribute  "userCounter" ,  Integer.toString counter  ;       System.out.println "User Count: " + counter ;     }   }   The second class of the application is the UserCounterServlet. This servlet displays the value of  the userCounter ServletContext attribute whenever someone requests the servlet. The code that  does this is written in the doGet method.   When the doGet method is invoked, you obtain the ServletContext object by calling the  getServletContext method.   ServletContext servletContext = getServletContext  ;   Then, the method tries to obtain an HttpSession object from the HttpServletRequest object and  creates one if no HttpSession object exists, as follows:   HttpSession session = request.getSession true ;   Next, you need to get the userCounter attribute from the ServletContext object:   int userCounter = 0;   userCounter = Integer.parseInt      String servletContext.getAttribute "userCounter"  ;   The complete code for the servlet is given in Listing 6.10.   Listing 6.10 The userCounterServlet Servlet   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;     public class UserCounterServlet extends HttpServlet {      public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response        throws ServletException, IOException {      ServletContext servletContext = getServletContext  ;       HttpSession session = request.getSession true ;       int userCounter = 0;       userCounter =          Integer.parseInt  String servletContext.getAttribute "userCounter"  ;         response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " User Counter " ;       out.println " " ;       174          out.println " " ;         out.println "There are " + userCounter + " users." ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;     }   }   For the example to work, you need to create a deployment descriptor as given in Listing 6.11.   Listing 6.11 The Deployment Descriptor for the UserCounter Example         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                             SessionLifeCycleEventDemo                                     UserCounter                           UserCounterServlet                     After you compile the two classes, open your browser and type in the URL for the servlet. You  should see something similar to Figure 6.3.   Figure 6.3. The user counter.      175         The HttpSessionAttributeListener Interface   The second session event listener interface is HttpSessionAttributeListener. You can implement  this interface if you need to listen to events related to session attributes. The interface provides  three methods: attributeAdded, attributeRemoved, and attributeReplaced. The signatures of the  three methods are as follows:   public void attributeAdded HttpSessionBindingEvent sbe    public void attributeRemoved HttpSessionBindingEvent sbe    public void attributeReplaced HttpSessionBindingEvent sbe    The attributeAdded method is called when an attribute is added to an HttpSession object. The  attributeRemoved and attributeReplaced methods are called when an HttpSession attribute is  removed or replaced, respectively.   All the methods receive an HttpSessionBindingEvent object whose class is described next.   The HttpSessionBindingEvent is derived from the HttpSessionEvent class so it inherits the  getSession method. In addition, the HttpSessionBindingEvent class has two methods: getName  and getValue. The signatures of the two methods are as follows:   public String getName     public Object getValue     The getName method returns the name of the attribute that is bound to an HttpSession or unbound  from an HttpSession. The getValue method returns the value of an HttpSession attribute that has  been added, removed, or replaced.        176      Summary   This chapter introduced application and session events and described the use of those events with  a few examples. The ability to listen to these events are not very critical, however they can be very  useful as shown in the examples in this chapter.      177      Chapter 7. Servlet Filtering   Filters are new in the Servlet 2.3 specification, enabling you to intercept a request before it reaches  a resource. In other words, a filter gives you access to the HttpServletRequest and the  HttpServletResponse objects before they are passed in to a servlet.   Filters can be very useful. For example, you can write a filter that records all incoming requests  and logs the IP addresses of the computers from which the requests originate. You also can use a  filter as an encryption and decryption device. Other uses include user authentication, data  compression, user input validation, and so on.   For a filter to intercept a request to a servlet, you must declare the filter with a   element in  the deployment descriptor and map the filter to the servlet using the   element.  Sometimes you want a filter to work on multiple servlets. You can do this by mapping a filter to a  URL pattern so that any request that matches that URL pattern will be filtered.   You also can put a set of filters in a chain. The first filter in the chain will be called first and then  pass control to the second filter, and so on. Filter chaining ensures that you can write a filter that  does a specific task but adds some functionality in another filter.   This chapter starts with javax.servlet.Filter, an interface that a filter class must implement. The  chapter then moves on to building various filters and along the way introduces other relevant  classes and interfaces.    An Overview of the API   When writing a filter, you basically deal with the following three interfaces in the javax.servlet  package:      Filter     FilterConfig     FilterChain   These three interfaces are described in the next sections.   The Filter Interface   javax.servlet.Filter is an interface that you must implement when writing a filter. The life cycle of  a filter is represented by this interface's three methods: init, doFilter, and destroy. Their signatures  are given here:   public void init FilterConfig filterConfig    public void doFilter HttpServletRequest request,     HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain chain    public void destroy     A filter starts its life when its init method is called by the servlet container. The servlet container  calls a filter's init method only once, when it finishes instantiating the filter. The servlet container  will pass in the FilterConfig object that represents the filter configuration. Normally, you assign      178                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       this object to an object variable so that the FilterConfig object will be available from other  methods. Compare the init method with the init method of the Servlet interface.   The doFilter method is where the filtering is performed. The servlet container calls the doFilter  method every time a user requests a resource, such as a servlet, to which the filter is mapped.  When doFilter is invoked, the servlet container passes in the HttpServletRequest object, the  HttpServletResponse object, and a FilterChain object. The HttpServletRequest and  HttpServletResponse objects are the same objects that will get passed to a servlet. You can  manipulate these two objects. For example, you can add an attribute to the HttpServletRequest  using the setAttribute method, or you can obtain the PrintWriter object of the HttpServletResponse  and write to it. The FilterChain object is useful here so that you can pass control to the next  resource. It will be explained in more detail when we discuss the FilterChain later in this chapter.   The doFilter method is analogous to the service method of the Servlet interface. The servlet  container calls the destroy method to tell the filter that it will be taken out of service. The filter can  then do some clean-up, if necessary. For instance, it can close a resource that it opened at  initialization. The destroy method in the Filter interface is similar to the destroy method in the  Servlet interface.   The FilterConfig Interface   A FilterConfig object represents the configuration for the filter. This object allows you to obtain  the ServletContext object and pass initialization values to the filter through its initial parameters,  which you define in the deployment descriptor when declaring the filter.   The FilterConfig interface has four methods: getFilterName, getInitParameter,  getInitParameterNames, and getServletContext. The signatures for these methods are as follows:   public String getFilterName     public String getInitParameter String parameterName    public java.util.Enumeration getInitParameterNames     public ServletContext getServletContext     The getFilterName method returns the name of the filter and the getServletContext method returns  the ServletContext object. The getInitParameterNames gives you an Enumeration containing all  parameter names of the filter. You then can retrieve the value of each individual initial parameter  using the getInitParameter, passing the parameter name.   The FilterChain Interface   As mentioned previously, a FilterChain object is passed in by the servlet container to the doFilter  method of the filter class. Filters use the FilterChain object to invoke the next filter in the chain, or,  if the filter is the last in the chain, to invoke the next resource  servlet .   The FilterChain interface has only one method: doFilter, whose signature is given as follows:   public void doFilter HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse   response    Note   Don't confuse this method with the doFilter method of the Filter interface. The latter has  three arguments.      179      You should always call the FilterChain interface's doFilter method to pass control over to the next  filter. If you are using only one filter, the doFilter method passes control to the next resource,  which can be a servlet you want to filter. Failure to call this method will make the program flow  stop.    A Basic Filter   As an example of your first filter, I will present here a very basic filter that does nothing other than  show its life cycle by printing a message to the console every time its method is invoked. This  filter also declares a FilterConfig object reference called filterConfig. In the init method, you pass  the FilterConfig object to this variable. Notice that the filter's doFilter method calls the doFilter  method of the FilterChain object at the last line of the method. You can find the code for the filter,  appropriately named BasicFilter, in Listing 7.1.   Listing 7.1 The BasicFilter Class   import java.io.IOException;   import javax.servlet.Filter;   import javax.servlet.FilterChain;   import javax.servlet.FilterConfig;   import javax.servlet.ServletException;   import javax.servlet.ServletRequest;   import javax.servlet.ServletResponse;     public class BasicFilter implements Filter {    private FilterConfig filterConfig;         public void init FilterConfig filterConfig  throws ServletException  {      System.out.println "Filter initialized" ;       this.filterConfig = filterConfig;     }       public void destroy   {      System.out.println "Filter destroyed" ;       this.filterConfig = null;     }       public void doFilter ServletRequest request, ServletResponse  response,       FilterChain chain        throws IOException, ServletException {      System.out.println "doFilter" ;       chain.doFilter request, response ;     }   }   For the filter to work, you need to decide which servlet or servlets you want to filter and tell the  servlet container by declaring the filter in the deployment descriptor using the   element and  the   element. These two elements must come before any   and    elements. The deployment descriptor for this example is given in Listing 7.2.   Listing 7.2 The Deployment Descriptor for this Example      180            <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                                   Basic Filter                         BasicFilter                                             Basic Filter                         FilteredServlet                                     SessionLifeCycleEventDemo                                     FilteredServlet                         FilteredServlet                     You can see that the filter name is Basic Filter and its class is BasicFilter. You also find a <filter- mapping> element that maps the filter to a servlet called FilteredServlet. You need to create a  servlet  that does anything  called FilteredServlet to see the example work.   After you compile the filter and servlet classes and modify your deployment descriptor, restart the  servlet container. You should see the message sent from the filter's init method in the console.   Open your browser and type the URL to the FilteredServlet servlet. You should see more  messages in the console that show how the filter is invoked before the servlet.   If you want to apply the filter to more than one servlet, you need only to repeat the <filter- mapping> element for each servlet. For example, the filter applies to both FilteredServlet and  FilteredServlet2 in the following deployment descriptor in Listing 7.3.   Listing 7.3 The Deployment Descriptor that Applies the Filter to More than One  Servlet           181        <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                                   Basic Filter                         BasicFilter                                             Basic Filter                         FilteredServlet                                     Basic Filter                         FilteredServlet2                                         FilteredServlet                           FilteredServlet                                     FilteredServlet2                         FilteredServlet2                      Mapping a Filter with a URL   In addition to mapping a filter to a servlet or a number of servlets, you can map the filter to a URL  pattern so all requests that match that pattern will invoke the filter.      182      Consider a servlet whose URL is similar to the following:   http:  localhost:8080 myApp servlet FilteredServlet   To map a filter to a URL pattern, you use the   element of your deployment  descriptor similar to the following:                     Logging Filter             servlet FilteredServlet        As an alternative, you can use  * to make the filter work for all static and dynamic resources, as  follows:                     Logging Filter             *         A Logging Filter   Here is another simple example of a filter that logs user IP addresses to the log file. The location  of the log file is servlet container implementation specific.  See Appendix A, "Tomcat Installation  and Configuration," for more information.    The filter class is given in Listing 7.4.   Listing 7.4 The Logging Filter   import java.io.IOException;   import javax.servlet.Filter;   import javax.servlet.FilterChain;   import javax.servlet.FilterConfig;   import javax.servlet.ServletContext;   import javax.servlet.ServletException;   import javax.servlet.ServletRequest;   import javax.servlet.ServletResponse;     public class LoggingFilter implements Filter {    private FilterConfig filterConfig = null;     public void destroy   {      System.out.println "Filter destroyed" ;       this.filterConfig = null;     }       public void doFilter ServletRequest request, ServletResponse  response,       183          FilterChain chain        throws IOException, ServletException {      System.out.println "doFilter" ;            Log user's IP address.       ServletContext servletContext = filterConfig.getServletContext  ;       servletContext.log request.getRemoteHost   ;       chain.doFilter request, response ;     }     public void init FilterConfig filterConfig  throws ServletException  {      System.out.println "Filter initialized" ;       this.filterConfig = filterConfig;     }   }   Not much difference exists between this filter and the BasicFilter, except that the doFilter method  obtains the ServletContext object and uses its log to record the client IP address obtained from the  getRemoteHost method of the HttpServletRequest object. The following code shows this action:      Log user's IP address.

Listing 7.6 gives you an  example of such a servlet.   Listing 7.6 A Servlet to Be Used with LoggingFilter   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;     public class FilteredServlet extends HttpServlet {      public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response    throws ServletException, IOException {        response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " User Counter " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println "IP:" + request.getRemoteHost   ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;     }   }    Filter Configuration   You can pass some initial parameters to a filter in a FilterConfig object that gets passed into the  init method of the Filter interface. The initial parameters are declared in the deployment descriptor  using the   element under the   element. For example, the following  deployment descriptor in Listing 7.7 describes a filter called MyFilter with two initial parameters:  adminPhone and adminEmail.   Listing 7.7 The Deployment Descriptor with a Filter with Two Initial Parameters   <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                                   MyFilter                       185            MyFilter                                       adminPhone                               0414789098                                                 adminEmail                               admin@labsale.com                                 You then can retrieve the values of the AdminPhone and AdminEmail parameters using the  following code, which you should put under the doFilter method of a filter:   String adminPhone = filterConfig.getInitParameter "adminPhone" ;   String adminEmail = filterConfig.getInitParameter "adminEmail" ;    A Filter that Checks User Input   When you receive input from a user, the first thing you should do is to check whether the input is  valid. If the input is invalid, you normally send an error message, telling the user that a correct  entry is needed.   Sometimes the input is not totally invalid; it only contains leading or trailing empty spaces. In this  case, you don't need to send an error message, but you can make the correction yourself; that is,  when you ask users to enter their first names into the firstName box in an HTML form, you need  to make sure that they type in something like "John" or "George", not "John" or "George"  with  blank spaces . Normally in situations like this, you use the trim function of the String class when  you obtain a parameter value, as follows:   String firstName = request.getParameter "firstName" ;   if  firstName != null      firstName = firstName.trim  ;   If you have quite a large number of input boxes in the HTML form, however, you have to call the  trim method for every parameter. Additionally, you need to do this in every servlet that accepts  user input. A filter can help make this task easier.   You can write a filter that trims every parameter value in the HttpServletRequest object before the  HttpServletRequest object reaches a servlet. This way, you don't need to trim anything in your      186      servlet. You need to write only one filter to serve all servlets that need this service. In the example  that follows, you get a chance to write a filter that trims all parameter values.   To ensure that the filter is able to trim all parameters in a HttpServletRequest object, do not hard- code the name of the parameter. Instead, use the getParameterNames method to obtain an  Enumeration containing all the parameter names. Next, you need to loop through the Enumeration  to get the parameter values and call the trim method.   You can't change a parameter value, however, which means that it is not possible to trim it directly.  A closer look at the HttpServletRequest reveals that you can set its attribute. What you can do is to  put trimmed parameter values as attributes. The parameter names become attribute names. Later,  in the servlet, instead of retrieving user input from HttpServletRequest parameters, you can obtain  the trimmed versions of the input from the HttpServletRequest attributes, as shown here:   Enumeration enum = request.getParameterNames  ;   while  enum.hasMoreElements    {    String parameterName =  String  enum.nextElement  ;     String parameterValue = request.getParameter parameterName ;     request.setAttribute parameterName, parameterValue.trim   ;   }   In your servlet, do the following to get a trimmed input value:   request.getAttribute parameterName ;   Instead of retrieving a value using the getParameter method of the HttpServletRequest, you use its  getAttribute method.   The filter that does this service is called TrimFilter and its code is given in Listing 7.8.   Listing 7.8 The TrimFilter   import java.io.*;   import javax.servlet.Filter;   import javax.servlet.FilterChain;   import javax.servlet.FilterConfig;   import javax.servlet.ServletContext;   import javax.servlet.ServletException;   import javax.servlet.ServletRequest;   import javax.servlet.ServletResponse;   import java.util.Enumeration;     public class TrimFilter implements Filter {    private FilterConfig filterConfig = null;     public void destroy   {      System.out.println "Filter destroyed" ;       this.filterConfig = null;     }       public void doFilter ServletRequest request, ServletResponse  response,       FilterChain chain        throws IOException, ServletException {      System.out.println "Filter" ;     Enumeration enum = request.getParameterNames  ;       while  enum.hasMoreElements    {        String parameterName =  String  enum.nextElement  ;         String parameterValue = request.getParameter parameterName ;       187            request.setAttribute parameterName, parameterValue.trim   ;       }         chain.doFilter request, response ;     }       public void init FilterConfig filterConfig  throws ServletException  {      System.out.println "Filter initialized" ;       this.filterConfig = filterConfig;     }   }   To illustrate the filter's use, you can write a servlet that does the following:      Send an HTML form with four input boxes  firstName, lastName, userName, and   password  when its doGet method is invoked.      Display the user input when its doPost method is invoked.   The servlet is called TrimFilteredServlet and is given in Listing 7.9.   Listing 7.9 TrimFilteredServlet   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;   import com.brainysoftware.java.StringUtil;     public class TrimFilteredServlet extends HttpServlet {      public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response        throws ServletException, IOException {      response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " User Input Form " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Please enter your details." ;       out.println " " ;       out.println "  " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " First Name: " ;       out.println "   " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Last Name: " ;       out.println "   " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " User Name: " ;       out.println "   " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Password: " ;       188                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®           out.println "   " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println "  " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;     }       public void doPost HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response        throws ServletException, IOException {        String firstName =  String  request.getAttribute "firstName" ;       String lastName =  String  request.getAttribute "lastName" ;       String userName =  String  request.getAttribute "userName" ;       String password = request.getParameter "password" ;       response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Displaying Values " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println "Here are your details." ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " First Name: " ;       out.println " " + StringUtil firstName  + " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Last Name: " ;       out.println " " + StringUtil lastName  + " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " User Name: " ;       out.println " " + StringUtil userName  + " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Password: " ;       out.println " " + StringUtil password  + " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       }     }   To work properly, your application needs the deployment descriptor in Listing 7.10.   Listing 7.10 The Deployment Descriptor           189        <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.

Figure 7.1. The doGet method.      190      Notice that in this form the user enters a last name with a leading blank space. When the user  submits the form, the browser will display the figure similar to Figure 7.2.   Figure 7.2. The doPost method.   See how the trailing blank spaces have disappeared? This is evidence of the filter at work.      191              Filtering the Response   You also can filter the response. In this example, you write a filter that appends a header and a  footer of every servlet in the application. The filter code is given in Listing 7.11.

Summary   This chapter introduced you to filters, a new feature in Servlet 2.3 specification that enables you to  perform some operations before the HTTP request reaches the servlet. Writing a filter involves in  three interfaces: Filter, FilterConfig, and FilterChain. For the filter to work on a certain resource,  you need to declare the filter in the deployment descriptor using the   element and map it to  the resources it is supposed to filter using the   element. You can map a filter to a  servlet or a URL pattern.   The next chapter will present the second technology for writing Java web applicationâJavaServer  Pages  JSP .      199      Chapter 8. JSP Basics   JavaServer Pages  JSP  is another Java technology for developing web applications. JSP was  released during the time servlet technology had gained popularity as one of the best web  technologies available. JSP is not meant to replace servlets, however. In fact, JSP is an extension  of the servlet technology, and it is common practice to use both servlets and JSP pages in the same  web applications.   Authoring JSP pages is so easy that you can write JSP applications without much knowledge of  the underlying API. If you want to be a really good Java web programmer, however, you need to  know both JSP and servlets. Even if you use only JSP pages in your Java web applications,  understanding servlets is still very important. As you will see in this chapter and the chapters to  come, JSP uses the same techniques as those found in servlet programming. For example, in JSP  you work with HTTP requests and HTTP responses, request parameters, request attributes, session  management, cookies, URL-rewriting, and so on. This chapter explains the relation between JSP  and servlets, introduces the JSP technology, and presents many examples that you can run easily.   Note   If you are not familiar with servlet technology, read this chapter only after reading  Chapters 1 to 7, which focus specifically on creating and working with servlets.     What's Wrong with Servlets?   The history of web server-side programming in Java started with servlets. Sun introduced servlets  in 1996 as small Java-based applications for adding dynamic content to web applications. Not  much later, with the increasing popularity of Java, servlets took off to become one of the most  popular technologies for Internet development today.   Servlet programmers know how cumbersome it is to program with servlets, however, especially  when you have to send a long HTML page that includes little code. Take the snippet in Listing 8.1  as an example. The code is a fragment from a servlet-based application that displays all parameter  names and values in an HTTP request.   Listing 8.1 Displays All Parameter Value Pairs in a Request Using a Servlet   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;   import java.util.*;     public class MyDearServlet extends HttpServlet {        Process the HTTP GET request     public void doGet HttpServletRequest request,       HttpServletResponse response        throws ServletException, IOException {        doPost request, response ;       }         200          Process the HTTP POST request     public void doPost HttpServletRequest request,       HttpServletResponse response        throws ServletException, IOException {        response.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println "  Using Servlets  " ;       out.println " " ;           Get parameter names       Enumeration parameters = request.getParameterNames  ;       String param = null;       while  parameters.hasMoreElements    {        param =  String  parameters.nextElement  ;         out.println param + ":" + request.getParameter param  +           " " ;       }       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.close  ;       }   End of doPost method          * other parts of the class goes here       .       .       .     *      }   End of class   Nearly half of the content sent from the doPost method is static HTML. However, each HTML tag  must be embedded in a String and sent using the println method of the PrintWriter object. It is a  tedious chore. Worse still, the HTML page may be much longer.   Another disadvantage of using servlets is that every single change will require the intervention of  the servlet programmer. Even a slight graphical modification, such as changing the value of the    tag's BGCOLOR attribute from DADADA to FFFFFF, will need to be done by the  programmer  who in this case will work under the supervision of the more graphic-savvy web  designer .   Sun understood this problem and soon developed a solution. The result was JSP technology.  According to Sun's web site, "JSP technology is an extension of the servlet technology created to  support authoring of HTML and XML pages." Combining fixed or static template data with  dynamic content is easier with JSP. Even if you're comfortable writing servlets, you will find in  this chapter several compelling reasons to investigate JSP technology as a complement to your  existing work.   What needs to be highlighted is that "JSP technology is an extension of the servlet technology."  This means that JSP did not replace servlets as the technology for writing server-side  Internet intranet applications. In fact, JSP was built on the servlet foundation and needs the servlet  technology to work.   JSP solves drawbacks in the servlet technology by allowing the programmer to intersperse code  with static content, for example. If the programmer has to work with an HTML page template  written by a web designer, the programmer can simply add code into the HTML page and save it      201      as a .jsp file. If at a later stage the web designer needs to change the HTML body background  color, he or she can do it without wasting the charging-by-the-hour programmer's time. He or she  can just open the .jsp file and edit it accordingly.   The code in Listing 8.1 can be rewritten in JSP as shown Listing 8.2.   Listing 8.2 Displays All Parameter Value Pairs in a Request Using JSP             Using JSP         <%       Get parameter names     Enumeration parameters = request.getParameterNames  ;     String param = null;     while  parameters.hasMoreElements    {      param =  String  parameters.nextElement  ;       out.println param + ":" + request.getParameter param  +         " " ;     }     out.close  ;   %>           You can see that   tags stay as they are. When you need to add dynamic content, all you  need to do is enclose your code in   tags.   Again, JSP is not a replacement for servlets. Rather, JSP technology and servlets together provide  an attractive solution to web scripting programming by offering platform independence, enhanced  performance, separation of logic from display, ease of administration, extensibility into the  enterprise, and most importantly, ease of use.     Running Your First JSP   This section invites you to write a simple JSP page and run it. The emphasis here is not on the  architecture or syntax and semantics of a JSP page; instead the section demonstrates how to  configure minimally the servlet JSP container to run JSP. Tomcat 4 is used to run JSP applications.  If you have installed and configured Tomcat 4 for your servlet applications, there is no more to do.  If you haven't, see Appendix A, "Tomcat Installation and Configuration."   Note   In the JSP context, Tomcat is often referred to as a "JSP container." Because Tomcat also  is used to run servlets, however, it is more common to call it a servlet JSP container.   After reading this section, you will understand how much JSP simplifies things for servlets. To  make your JSP page run, all you need to do is configure your JSP container  Tomcat  and write a  JSP page. Configuration is only done once, at the beginning. No compilation is necessary.   Configuring Tomcat to Run a JSP Application      202      The first thing you need to do before you can run your JSP application is configure Tomcat so that  it recognizes your JSP application. To configure Tomcat to run a particular JSP application, follow  these steps:   1.  Create a directory under %CATALINA_HOME% webapps called myJSPApp. The   directory structure is shown in Figure 8.1.   Figure 8.1. The JSP application directory structure for the myJSPApp   application.      2.  Add a subdirectory named WEB-INF under the myJSPApp directory.  3.  Edit server.xml, the server configuration file, so Tomcat knows about this new JSP   application. The server.xml file is located in the conf directory under  %CATALINA_HOME%. Open the file with your text editor and look for code similar to  the following:   <Context path=" examples" docBase="examples" debug="0"                    reloadable="true">   .   .   .       Right after the closing tag  , add the following code:   <Context path=" myJSPApp" docBase="myJSPApp" debug="0"  reloadable="true">       4.  Restart Tomcat.      203   Now you can write your JSP file and store it under the myJSPApp file. Alternatively, to make it  more organized, you can create a subdirectory called jsp under myJSPApp and store your JSP files  there. If you do this, you don't need to change the setting in the server.xml file.   A JSP page consists of interwoven HTML tags and Java code. The HTML tags represent the  presentation part and the code produces the contents. In its most basic form, a JSP page can  include only the HTML part, like the code shown in Listing 8.3.   Listing 8.3 The Simplest JSP Page      Writing a JSP File                   JSP is easy.           Save this file as SimplePage.jsp in the myJSPApp directory. Your directory structure should  resemble Figure 8.1.   Now, start your web browser, and type the following URL:   http:  localhost:8080 myJSPApp SimplePage.jsp   The browser is shown in Figure 8.2.   Figure 8.2. Your first JSP page.      204         Other Examples   Of course, the code in Listing 8.3 is not a really useful page, but it illustrates the point that a JSP  page does not need to have code at all. If your page is purely static, like the one in Listing 8.3, you  shouldn't put it in a JSP file because JSP files are slower to process than HTML files. You might  want to use a JSP file for pure HTML tags, however, if you think the code might include Java  code in the future. This saves you the trouble of changing all the links to this page at the later  stage.   To write Java code in your JSP file, you embed the code in   tags. For example, the code  in Listing 8.4 is an example of intertwining Java code and HTML in a JSP file.   Listing 8.4 Interweaving HTML and Code                   <%     out.println "JSP is easy" ;   %>           The code in Listing 8.4 produces the same output as the one in Listing 8.3. Notice, however, the  use of the Java code to send the text. If you don't understand what out.println does, bear with me  for a momentâit is discussed in detail in the next section. For now, knowing that out.println is  used to send a String to the web browser is sufficient.   Notice also that the output of a JSP page is plain text consisting of HTML tags. No code section of  the page will be sent to the browser.   Another example is given in Listing 8.5. This snippet displays the string "Welcome. The server  time is now" followed by the server time.   Listing 8.5 Displaying the Server Time              Displaying the server time            Welcome. The server time is now   <%     java.util.Calendar now = java.util.Calendar.getInstance  ;     int hour = now.get java.util.Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY ;     int minute = now.get java.util.Calendar.MINUTE ;       if  hour<10        out.println "0" + hour ;     else       out.println hour ;       out.println ":" ;       if  minute<10        out.println "0" + minute ;       205        else       out.println minute ;     %>             How JSP Works   The code in Listing 8.5 displays the time in the hh:mm format. Therefore, if the hour is less than  10, a "0" precedes, which means that nine will be displayed as 09 instead of 9.   Inside the JSP container is a special servlet called the page compiler. The servlet container is  configured to forward to this page compiler all HTTP requests with URLs that match the .jsp file  extension. This page compiler turns a servlet container into a JSP container. When a .jsp page is  first called, the page compiler parses and compiles the .jsp page into a servlet class. If the  compilation is successful, the jsp servlet class is loaded into memory. On subsequent calls, the  servlet class for that .jsp page is already in memory; however, it could have been updated.  Therefore, the page compiler servlet will always compare the timestamp of the jsp servlet with the  jsp page. If the .jsp page is more current, recompilation is necessary. With this process, once  deployed, JSP pages only go through the time-consuming compilation process once.   You may be thinking that after the deployment, the first user requests for a .jsp page will  experience unusually slow response due to the time spent for compiling the .jsp file into a jsp  servlet. To avoid this unpleasant situation, a mechanism in JSP allows the .jsp pages to be pre- compiled before any user request for them is received. Alternatively, you deploy your JSP  application as a web archive file in the form of a compiled servlet. This technique is discussed in  Chapter 16, "Application Deployment."     The JSP Servlet Generated Code   When the JSP is invoked, Tomcat creates two files in the  C:\%CATALINA_HOME%\work\localhost\examples\jsp directory. Those two files are  SimplePage_ jsp.java and SimplePage_ jsp.class. When you open the SimplePage_ jsp.java file,  you will see the following:   package org.apache.jsp;     import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import javax.servlet.jsp.*;   import javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.*;   import org.apache.jasper.runtime.*;       public class SimplePage_jsp extends HttpJspBase {      static {     }       public SimplePage_jsp   {    }       206          private static boolean _jspx_inited = false;       public final void _jspx_init   throws  org.apache.jasper.JasperException {    }       public void _jspService HttpServletRequest request,       HttpServletResponse  response        throws java.io.IOException, ServletException {        JspFactory _jspxFactory = null;       PageContext pageContext = null;       HttpSession session = null;       ServletContext application = null;       ServletConfig config = null;       JspWriter out = null;       Object page = this;       String  _value = null;       try {        if  _jspx_inited == false  {          synchronized  this  {            if  _jspx_inited == false  {             _jspx_init  ;              _jspx_inited = true;             }           }         }        _jspxFactory = JspFactory.getDefaultFactory  ;         response.setContentType "text html;charset=ISO-8859-1" ;         pageContext = jspxFactory.getPageContext this,           request, response, "", true, 8192, true ;         application = pageContext.getServletContext  ;         config = pageContext.getServletConfig  ;         session = pageContext.getSession  ;         out = pageContext.getOut  ;              begin   [file="C:\\tomcat4\\bin\\..\\webapps\\examples\\jsp\\SimplePage.jsp"; from= 0, 2 ;to= 2,0 ]         out.println "JSP is easy" ;            end            HTML    begin   [file="C:\\tomcat4\\bin\\..\\webapps\\examples\\jsp\\SimplePage.jsp"; from= 2, 2 ;to= 3,0 ]         out.write "\r\n" ;            end         }         catch  Throwable t  {          if  out != null && out.getBufferSize   != 0              out.clearBuffer  ;           if  pageContext != null              pageContext.handlePageException t ;         }         finally {         if  _jspxFactory != null            _jspxFactory.releasePageContext pageContext ;         }       }     }      207   For now, I will defer a full explanation of the preceding code until you learn more about how the  interfaces and classes are used to run a JSP page. You can read the section, "The Generated  Servlet Revisited," later in this chapter, to learn more about the code listed here.        The JSP API   The JSP technology is based on the JSP API that consists of two packages: javax.servlet.jsp and  javax.servlet.jsp.tagext. Both packages are given in detail in Appendix D, "The javax.servlet.jsp  Package Reference," and Appendix E, "The javax.servlet.jsp.tagext Package Reference." This  chapter will discuss the classes and interfaces of the javax.servlet.jsp package and  javax.servlet.jsp.tagext will be discussed in Chapter 11, "Using JSP Custom Tags."   In addition to these two packages, JSP also needs the two servlet packagesâjavax.servlet and  javax.servlet.http. When you study the javax.servlet.jsp package, you will know why we say that  JSP is an extension of servlet technology and understand why it is important that a JSP application  programmer understands the servlet technology well.   The javax.servlet.jsp package has two interfaces and four classes. The interfaces are as follows:   JspPage         HttpJspPage   The four classes are as follows:   JspEngineInfo  JspFactory  JspWriter               PageContext   The JspPage Interface   In addition, there are also two exception classes: JspException and JspError.   The JspPage is the interface that must be implemented by all JSP servlet classes. This may remind  you of the javax.servlet.Servlet interface in Chapter 1, "The Servlet Technology," of course. And,  not surprisingly, the JspPage interface does extend the javax.servlet.Servlet interface.   The JSPPage interface has two methods, JspInit and JspDestroy, whose signatures are as follows:   public void jspInit     public void jspDestroy     jspInit, which is similar to the init method in the javax.servlet.Servlet interface, is called when the  JspPage object is created and can be used to run some initialization. This method is called only  once during the life cycle of the JSP page: the first time the JSP page is invoked.   The jspDestroy method is analogous with the destroy method of the javax.servlet.Servlet interface.  This method is called before the JSP servlet object is destroyed. You can use this method to do  some clean-up, if you want.   Most of the time, however, JSP authors rarely make full use of these two methods. The following  example illustrates how you can implement these two methods in your JSP page:      208                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       <%!     public void jspInit   {      System.out.println "Init" ;     }     public void jspDestroy   {      System.out.println "Destroy" ;     }   %>   <%     out.println "JSP is easy" ;   %>   Notice that the first line of the code starts with <%!. You will find the explanation of this construct  in the Chapter 9, "JSP Syntax."   The HttpJspPage Interface   This interface directly extends the JspPage interface. There is only one method: _ jspService. This  method is called by the JSP container to generate the content of the JSP page. The _ jspService  has the following signature:   public void _jspService HttpServletRequest request,     HttpServletResponse response  throws ServletException, IOException.   You can't include this method in a JSP page, such as in the following code:   <%!     public void jspInit   {      System.out.println "Init" ;     }     public void jspDestroy   {      System.out.println "Destroy" ;     }     public void _jspService HttpServletRequest request,       HttpServletResponse response  throws ServletException,  IOException {      System.out.println "Service" ;     }   %>   This is because the page content itself represents this method. See the section "The Generated  Servlet Revisited."   The JspFactory Class   The JspFactory class is an abstract class that provides methods for obtaining other objects needed  for the JSP page processing. The class has the static method getDefaultFactory that returns a  JspFactory object. From the JspFactory object, a PageContext and a JspEngineInfo object can be  obtained that are useful for the JSP page processing. These objects are obtained using the  JspFactory class's getEngineInfo method and the getPageContext method, whose signatures are  given here:   public abstract JspEngineInfo getEngineInfo     public abstract PageContext getPageContext    Servlet requestingServlet, ServletRequest request,   ServletResponse response, String errorPageURL,   boolean needsSession, int buffer, boolean autoFlush       209      The following code is part of the _ jspService method that is generated by the JSP container:   JspFactory _jspxFactory = null;   PageContext pageContext = null;   jspxFactory = JspFactory.getDefaultFactory  ;   .   .   .   pageContext = _jspxFactory.getPageContext this, request,     response,   "", true, 8192, true ;   The JspEngineInfo Class   The JspEngineInfo class is an abstract class that provides information on the JSP container. Only  one method, getSpecificationVersion, returns the JSP container's version number. Because this is  the only method currently available, this class does not have much use.   You can obtain a JspEngineInfo object using the getEngineInfo method of the JspFactory class.   The PageContext Class   PageContext represents a class that provides methods that are implementation-dependent. The  PageContext class itself is abstract, so in the _ jspService method of a JSP servlet class, a  PageContext object is obtained by calling the getPageContext method of the JspFactory class.   The PageContext class provides methods that are used to create other objects. For example, its  getOut method returns a JspWriter object that is used to send strings to the web browser. Other  methods that return servlet-related objects include the following:                   getRequest, returns a ServletRequest object  getResponse, returns a ServletResponse object  getServletConfig, returns a ServletConfig object  getServletContext, returns a ServletContext object  getSession, returns an HttpSession object   The JspWriter Class   The JspWriter class is derived from the java.io.Writer class and represents a Writer that you can  use to write to the client browser. Of its many methods, the most important are the print and  println methods. Both provide enough overloads that ensure you can write any type of data. The  difference between print and println is that println always adds the new line character to the  printed data.   Additional methods allow you to manipulate the buffer. For instance, the clear method clears the  buffer. It throws an exception if some of the buffer's content has already been flushed. Similar to  clear is the clearBuffer method, which clears the buffer but never throws any exception if any of  the buffer's contents have been flushed.     The Generated Servlet Revisited   Now that you understand the various interfaces and classes in the javax.servlet.jsp package,  analyzing the generated JSP servlet will make more sense.      210      When you study the generated code, the first thing you'll see is the following:   public class SimplePage_jsp extends HttpJspBase {   The discussion should start with the questions, "What is HttpJspBase?"and "Why doesn't the JSP  servlet class implement the javax.servlet.jsp.JspPage or javax.servlet.jsp.HttpJspPage interface?"   First, remember that the JSP specification defines only standards for writing JSP pages. A JSP  page itself will be translated into a java file, which in turn will be compiled into a servlet class.  The two processes are implementation dependent and do not affect the way a JSP page author  codes. Therefore, a JSP container has the freedom and flexibility to do the page translation in its  own way. The JSP servlet-generated code presented in this chapter is taken from Tomcat. You can  therefore expect a different Java file to be generated by other JSP containers.   In Tomcat, HttpJspBase is a class whose source can be found under the  src\jasper\src\share\org\apache\jasper\runtime directory under the %CATALINA_HOME%  directory.   Most importantly, the signature of this class is as follows:   public abstract class HttpJspBase extends HttpServlet     implements HttpJspPage   Now you can see that HttpJspBase is an HttpServlet and it does implement the  javax.servlet.jsp.HttpJspPage interface. The HttpJspBase is more like a wrapper class so that its  derived class does not have to provide implementation for the interface's methods if the JSP page  author does not override them.

The three lines of code, however, translate into  the _ jspService method. For reading convenience, the method is reprinted here. Notice that, for  clarity, the comments have been removed.   public void _jspService HttpServletRequest request,     HttpServletResponse  response      throws java.io.IOException, ServletException {      JspFactory _jspxFactory = null;     PageContext pageContext = null;     HttpSession session = null;     ServletContext application = null;     ServletConfig config = null;     JspWriter out = null;     Object page = this;     String  _value = null;     try {      if  _jspx_inited == false  {        synchronized  this  {          if  _jspx_inited == false  {           _jspx_init  ;       213               _jspx_inited = true;           }         }       }      _jspxFactory = JspFactory.getDefaultFactory  ;       response.setContentType "text html;charset=ISO-8859-1" ;       pageContext = jspxFactory.getPageContext this,         request, response, "", true, 8192, true ;       application = pageContext.getServletContext  ;       config = pageContext.getServletConfig  ;       session = pageContext.getSession  ;       out = pageContext.getOut  ;         out.println "JSP is easy" ;       out.write "\r\n" ;       }       catch  Throwable t  {        if  out != null && out.getBufferSize   != 0            out.clearBuffer  ;         if  pageContext != null            pageContext.handlePageException t ;       }       finally {       if  _jspxFactory != null          _jspxFactory.releasePageContext pageContext ;       }     }     Implicit Objects   Having examined the generated JSP servlet source code, you know that the code contains several  object declarations in its _ jspService method. Recall this part from the code in the preceding  section:   public void _jspService HttpServletRequest request,     HttpServletResponse  response      throws java.io.IOException, ServletException {      JspFactory _jspxFactory = null;     PageContext pageContext = null;     HttpSession session = null;     ServletContext application = null;     ServletConfig config = null;     JspWriter out = null;     Object page = this;     String  _value = null;     try {        .         .         .      _jspxFactory = JspFactory.getDefaultFactory  ;       response.setContentType "text html;charset=ISO-8859-1" ;       pageContext = jspxFactory.getPageContext this,         request, response, "", true, 8192, true ;       application = pageContext.getServletContext  ;       config = pageContext.getServletConfig  ;       session = pageContext.getSession  ;       214          out = pageContext.getOut  ;     .     .     .   }   You see that there are object references, such as pageContext, session, application, config, out,  and so on. These object references are created whether they are used from inside the page. They  are automatically available for the JSP page author to use! These objects are called implicit objects  and are summarized in the Table 8.1.   Object   request  response  out  session  application  config  pageContext  page  exception   Table 8.1. JSP Implicit Objects   Type   javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest  javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse  javax.servlet.jsp.JspWriter  javax.servlet.http.HttpSession  javax.servlet.ServletContext  javax.servlet.ServletConfig  javax.servlet.jsp.PageContext  javax.servlet.jsp.HttpJspPage  java.lang.Throwable   By looking at Table 8.1, you now know why you can send a String of text by simply writing:   <%     out.println "JSP is easy." ;   %>   In the case of the code above, you use the implicit object out that represents a  javax.servlet.jsp.JspWriter. All the implicit objects are discussed briefly in the following  subsections.   request and response Implicit Objects   In servlets, both objects are passed in by the servlet container to the service method of the  javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet class. Remember its signature?   protected void service HttpServletRequest request,     HttpServletResponse response      throws ServletException, IOException   Note   If you want to review servlets, you can go back to Chapters 1, "The Servlet Technology,"  and Chapter 2," Inside Servlets," for more details.   In a servlet, before you send any output, you are required to call the setContentType of the  HttpServletResponse to tell the browser the type of the content, as in the following code:   response.setContentType "text html" ;   In JSP, this is done automatically for you in the generated JSP servlet class, as follows:      215      response.setContentType "text html;charset=ISO-8859-1" ;   Having an HttpServletRequest and an HttpServletResponse, you can do anything you like as you  would in a servlet. For example, the following JSP page retrieves the value of a parameter called  firstName and displays it in the browser:            Simple Page            <%     String firstName = request.getParameter "firstName" ;     out.println "First name: " + firstName ;   %>           The following example uses the sendRedirect method of the  javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse to redirect the user to a different URL:   <%     response.sendRedirect "http:  www.newriders.com" ;   %>   out Implicit Object   out is probably the most frequently used implicit object. You call either its print method or its  println method to send text or other data to the client browser. In a servlet, you always need to call  the getWriter method of the javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse interface to obtain a  PrintWriter before you can output anything to the browser, as follows:   PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;   In JSP, you don't need to do this because you already have an out that represents a  javax.servlet.jsp.JspWriter object.   session Implicit Object   The session implicit object represents the HttpSession object that you can retrieve in a servlet by  calling the getSession method of the javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest interface, as in the  following code:   request.getSession  ;   The following code is a JSP page that uses a session object to implement a counter:            Counter            <%     String counterAttribute =  String  session.getAttribute "counter" ;     int count = 0;     try {      216          count = Integer.parseInt counterAttribute ;     }     catch  Exception e  {    }     count++;     session.setAttribute "counter", Integer.toString count  ;     out.println "This is the " + count + "th time you visited this page  in this   session." ;   %>           See how session is readily available without efforts from the programmer's side?   Note that the session object is available only in a JSP page that participates in the session  management. To decide whether or not your JSP page should participate in the session  management, see the discussion of the session management as discussed in Chapter 5,  "Session Management."   The application implicit object represents the javax.servlet.ServletContext object. In an  HttpServlet, you can retrieve the ServletContext method by using the getServletContext method.   The config implicit object represents a javax.servlet.ServletConfig object that in a servlet can be  retrieved by using the getServletConfig method.   The pageContext implicit object represents the javax.servlet.jsp.PageContext object discussed in  the section, "The PageContext Class."   The page implicit object represents the javax.servlet.jsp.HttpJspPage interface explained in the  section, "The HttpJspPage Interface."   The exception object is available only on pages that have been defined as error pages.

You may be able to author a JSP page  without understanding the underlying API. However, mastering the classes and interfaces in the  javax.servlet.jsp package and understanding how JSP extends the servlet technology provides you  with the knowledge to write more powerful and efficient code.      217      Chapter 9. JSP Syntax   There are three types of elements:      Directive elements     Scripting elements     Action elements   In Chapter 8, "JSP Basics," you learned that a JSP page can have Java code and HTML tags. More  formally, you can say that a JSP page has elements and template data. The elements, which also  are called JSP tags, make up the syntax and semantics of JSP. Template data is everything else.  Template data includes parts that the JSP container does not understand, such as HTML tags.   To write an effective JSP page, you need to understand all these elements well. Elements have two  forms: the XML form and the   alternative form. The conversion between the XML form  and the alternative form is presented at the end of the chapter in the section, "Converting into  XML Syntax."Template data remains as it is, normally passed through the client uninterpreted.   This chapter discusses the three types of JSP elements and comments. It also presents examples on  how to use these elements. You will also learn how incorporating these elements affects the JSP  servletsâservlets that result from the translation of JSP pages.       Directives   Directives are messages to the JSP container containing information on how the JSP container  must translate a JSP page into a corresponding servlet. Directives have the following syntax:       The asterisk  *  means that what is enclosed in the brackets can be repeated zero or more times.  The syntax can be re-written in a more informal way as follows:       White spaces after the opening   are optional, but are  recommended to enhance readability.   Warning   Note that an attribute value must be quoted.   Warning the three types of directives are as follows:      Page directives        Tag library directives   Include directives   The first two directives are discussed in detail in this chapter. Discussion on the tag library  directive is deferred until Chapter 11, "Using JSP Custom Tags."      218                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       The Page Directive   The Page directive has the following syntax:       Or, if you want to use the more informal syntax:       The Page directive supports 11 attributes. These attributes are summarized in Table 9.1.   Table 9.1. The Page Directive's Attributes   Attribute   Value Type   Scripting language name  String   language  info  contentType  MIME type, character set  Class name  extends  Fully qualified class name or package name  import  Buffer size or false  buffer  Boolean  autoFlush  Boolean  session  isThreadSafe  Boolean  errorPage  isErrorPage  Boolean   URL   Default Value   "java"  Depends on the JSP container  "text html;charset=ISO-8859-1"  None  None  8192  "true"  "true"  "true"  None  "false"   An example of the use of the Page directive is as follows:       With JSP, you can specify multiple page directives in your JSP page, such as the following:           Except for the import attribute, however, JSP does not allow you to repeat the same attribute  within a page directive or in multiple directives on the same page.   The following is illegal because the info attribute appears more than once in a single page:               The following also is illegal because the buffer attribute appears more than once in the same page  directive:       The following is legal, however, because the import attribute can appear multiple times:           219              Alternatively, imported libraries can appear in a single import attribute, separated by commas, as  shown in the following code:       The following section discusses each attribute in more detail and examines the effect on the  generated servlet.   The language Attribute   The language attribute specifies the scripting language used in the JSP page. By default, the value  is "java" and all JSP containers must support Java as the scripting language. With Tomcat, this is  the only accepted language. Other JSP containers might accept different languages, however.   Specifying this attribute, as in the following code, does not have any effect on the generated  servlet:       <%     out.println "JSP is easy" ;   %>   In fact, this attribute is useful only in a JSP container that supports a language other than Java as  the scripting language.   The info Attribute   The info attribute allows you to insert any string that later can be retrieved using the  getServletInfo method. For example, you can add the following page directive with an info  attribute:       The JSP container then will create a public method getServletInfo in the resulting servlet. This  method returns the value of the info attribute specified in the page. For the previous page directive,  the getServletInfo method will be written as follows:   public String getServletInfo   {    return "Written by Bulbul";   }   In the same JSP page, you can retrieve the info attribute's value by calling the getServletInfo  method. For instance, the following JSP page will return "Written by Bulbul" on the client  browser.       <%     out.println getServletInfo   ;   %>   The default value for this attribute depends on the JSP container.   The contentType Attribute      220      The contentType attribute defines the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension  MIME  type of the  HTTP response sent to the client. The default value is "text html;charset=ISO-8859-1" and this is  reflected in _jspService method in the generated servlet. For example, this is the cleaned up  version of the servlet that is generated from a JSP page that does not specify the contentType  attribute in its page directive; that is, the default value is used:   public void _jspService HttpServletRequest request,     HttpServletResponse  response      throws java.io.IOException, ServletException {      .       .       .     try {      .       .       .      _jspxFactory = JspFactory.getDefaultFactory  ;       response.setContentType "text html;charset=ISO-8859-1" ;       .       .       .     }     catch  Throwable t  {      .       .       .     }     finally {      .       .       .     }   }   You will want to use this attribute when working with pages that need to send characters in other  encoding schemes. For example, the following directive tells the JSP container that the output  should be sent using simplified Chinese characters:       The extends Attribute   The import Attribute   The extends attribute defines the parent class that will be inherited by the generated servlet. You  should use this attribute with extra care. In most cases, you should not use this attribute at all. In  Tomcat, the parent class that will be subclassed by the resulting servlet is HttpJspBase.   The import attribute is similar to the import keyword in a Java class or interface. The attribute is  used to import a class or an interface or all members of a package. You will definitely use this  attribute often. Whatever you specify in the import attribute of a page directive will be translated  into an import statement in the generated servlet class. By default, Tomcat specifies the following  import statements in every generated servlet class. You don't need to import what has been  imported by default:   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import javax.servlet.jsp.*;       221      import javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.*;   import org.apache.jasper.runtime.*;   As an example, consider the following JSP page that imports the java.io package and the  java.util.Enumeration interface:           The two will be added before the default import statements in the generated servlet class, as  described in the following code fragment:   import java.io.*;   import java.util.Enumeration;   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import javax.servlet.jsp.*;   import javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.*;   import org.apache.jasper.runtime.*;   The buffer Attribute   By default, a JSP page's content is buffered to increase performance. The default size of the buffer  is 8Kb or 8192 characters.   Consider an example that specifies the buffer attribute with a size of 16Kb:       This attribute is reflected in the _jspService method in the generated servlet class, as in the  following cleaned up code. The buffer size is passed to the getPageContext method of the  javax.servlet.jsp.JspFactory class when creating a PageContext object.   public void _jspService HttpServletRequest request,     HttpServletResponse  response      throws java.io.IOException, ServletException {    .     .     .     try {      .       .       .      _jspxFactory = JspFactory.getDefaultFactory  ;       response.setContentType "text html;charset=ISO-8859-1" ;            8192 in the following line represents the buffer size       pageContext = jspxFactory.getPageContext this, request,         response, "", true, 16384, true ;       .       .       .     }     catch  Throwable t  {      .       .       .     }       222        finally {      .       .       .     }   }   With the buffer attribute in a page directive, you can do two things:      Eliminate the buffer by specifying the value "none", as in the following code:       If you decide not to use a buffer, the getPageContext method will be invoked passing 0 as  the buffer size, as in the following code:   pageContext = _jspxFactory.getPageContext   this, request, response, "", true, 0, true ;      Change the size of the buffer by assigning a number to the attribute. The attribute value  represents the number in kilobytes. Therefore, "16" means 16Kb alias 16384 characters.  You can either write the number only, or the number plus "Kb". For example, "16" is the  same as "16Kb".   The following example shows two page directives in two different JSP pages. The first cancels the  use of the buffer, and the second changes the size of the buffer to 12Kb.           Warning   Note that the JSP container has the discretion to use a buffer size larger than specified to  improve performance.   The autoFlush Attribute   The autoFlush attribute is related to the page buffer. When the value is "true", the JSP container  will automatically flush the buffer when the buffer is full. If the value is "false", however, the JSP  author needs to flush the buffer manually using the flush method of the JspWriter object, such as  the following:   For example, the following code specifies a false value for the autoFlush attribute:   out.flush  ;       The session Attribute   By default, a JSP page participates in the JSP container's session management. This is indicated by  the declaration of a javax.servlet.http.HttpSession object reference and the creation of it through  the getSession method of the javax.servlet.jsp.PageContext, as illustrated by the following code:   public void _jspService HttpServletRequest request,       223        HttpServletResponse  response      throws java.io.IOException, ServletException {      JspFactory _jspxFactory = null;     PageContext pageContext = null;        declare an HttpSession object reference     HttpSession session = null;       try {      .       .       .     jspxFactory = JspFactory.getDefaultFactory  ;     response.setContentType "text html;charset=ISO-8859-1" ;     pageContext = _jspxFactory.getPageContext       this, request, response, "", true, 0, true ;     application = pageContext.getServletContext  ;     config = pageContext.getServletConfig  ;        create a HttpSession object     session = pageContext.getSession  ;       .       .       .     }     catch  Throwable t  {        .       .       .     }     finally {      .       .       .     }   }   Whether your JSP page participates in the session management is determined by the value of the  session attribute in a page directive. By default this value is true; that is, the JSP page is part of the  session management. I want to make an important point, however: You should not let your JSP  page participate in the session management unnecessarily because this consumes resources.  Because of this, you should always use the session attribute and assign it the value of "false"  unless you are specifically needing session management.   When the value of this attribute is "false", no javax.servlet.http.HttpSession object reference is  declared and no HttpSession object is created. As a result, the session implicit object is not  available in the JSP page.   The following shows an example of the use of the session attribute:       The isThreadSafe Attribute   As discussed in Chapter 2, "Inside Servlets," you can make a servlet thread-safe by inheriting the  javax.servlet.SingleThreadModel. You can control this behavior in the JSP page by using the  isThreadSafe attribute, which by default has the value of "true". When the value of this attribute is  true, you guarantee that simultaneous access to this page is safe. However, you can assign "false"  to this attribute as in the following code:      224          By setting the isThreadSafe attribute to false, you are telling the JSP translator that you  the  programmer of this page  cannot guarantee that simultaneous accesses to this page will be safe.  Therefore, you are asking the JSP translator to make this page thread-safe. This will make the  generated servlet implement the javax.servlet.SingleThreadModel interface, as in the following  signature of the JSP servlet class:   public class SimplePage_jsp extends HttpJspBase     implements SingleThreadModel   In other words, when the value of this attribute is false, the JSP container will serialize multiple  requests for this page; that is, the JSP container will wait until the JSP servlet finishes responding  to a request before passing another request to it.   The errorPage Attribute   The errorPage attribute specifies the URL of an error page that will be displayed if an uncaught  exception occurs in this current JSP page. Referring to the URL of the error page is sometimes  tricky. The easiest solution is to store the error page in the same directory as the current JSP page.  In this case, you need only to mention the name of the error page, as in the following example:       <%     String name = request.getParameter "otherName" ;        this will throw an exception because the parameter "otherName"        does not exist, so name will be null.        this will cause the ErrorPage.jsp to be displayed     name.substring 1, 1 ;   %>   When the page is called, the error page is displayed. An error page must specify the isErrorPage  attribute in its page directive and the value of this attribute must be "true".   The following is an errorPage attribute that is assigned an error page in a URL:       The isErrorPage Attribute   The isErrorPage attribute can accept the value of "true" or "false", and the default value is "false".  It indicates whether the current JSP page is an error page; that is, the page that will be displayed  when an uncaught exception occurs in the other JSP page. If the current page is an error page, it  has access to the exception implicit object, as explained in Chapter 8.   The include Directive   The include directive is the second type of the JSP directive elements. This directive enables JSP  page authors to include the contents of other files in the current JSP page.   The include directive is useful if you have a common source that will be used by more than one  JSP page. Instead of repeating the same code in every JSP page, thus creating a maintenance  problem, you can place the common code in a separate file and use an include directive from each  JSP page.      225      The included page itself can be static, such as an HTML file, or dynamic, such as another JSP  page. If you are including a JSP page, the included JSP page itself can include another file.  Therefore, nesting include directives is permitted in JSP.   The syntax for the include directive is as follows:       The following is an example of how to include HTML files:       <%     out.println " " ;        other content;   %>       Note   If the relativeURL part begins with a forward slash character    , it is interpreted as an  absolute path on the server. If relativeURL does not start with a " ", it is interpreted as  relative to the current JSP page.   Now, we'll look at how included files are translated into the JSP servlet file. The following  example is a simple JSP page that includes two HTML files: Header.html and Footer.html. Both  included files are located under the includes subdirectory, which itself is under the directory that  hosts the current JSP file. The JSP page is called SimplePage.jsp and is given in Listing 9.1. The  page simply displays the current server time. The Header.html is given in Listing 9.2 and the  Footer.html in Listing 9.3. What you are interested in here is the generated servlet code.

Because all the included files are  placed inline before being compiled, including files does not have any performance effect on the  application.   The taglib, or tag library, directive can be used to extend JSP functionality. This is a broad topic  and has been given a chapter of its own.  See Chapter 11, "Using JSP Custom Tags," for more  information.    Scripting elements allow you to insert Java code in your JSP pages. There are three types of  scripting elements:   The three elements are discussed in the following sections.   Throughout the previous chapters and up to this point in this chapter, you have seen scriptlets in  the examples. Scriptlets are the code blocks of a JSP page. Scriptlets start with an opening <% tag  and end with a closing %> tag.   Directives also start with  . However, in a directive a @ follows the  <%.   The following JSP page is an example of using scriptlets. In the JSP page, you try to connect to a  database and retrieve all records from a table called Users. Among the fields in the Users table are  FirstName, LastName, UserName, and Password. Upon obtaining a ResultSet object, you display  all the records in an HTML table. The JSP page is given in Listing 9.4.   Listing 9.4 Displaying Database Records           <%     try {      Class.forName "sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver" ;       System.out.println "JDBC driver loaded" ;     }     catch  ClassNotFoundException e  {      System.out.println e.toString   ;     }       229      %>            Display All Users                  Displaying All Users                     First Name     Last Name     User Name     Password        <%     String sql = "SELECT FirstName, LastName, UserName, Password" +       " FROM Users";     try {      Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:odbc:JavaWeb" ;         Statement s = con.createStatement  ;       ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery sql ;         while  rs.next    {        out.println " " ;           out.println " " + rs.getString 1  + " " ;         out.println " " + rs.getString 2  + " " ;         out.println " " + rs.getString 3  + " " ;         out.println " " + rs.getString 4  + " " ;         out.println " " ;       }       rs.close  ;       s.close  ;       con.close  ;     }     catch  SQLException e  {    }     catch  Exception e  {    }   %>                   The result of this JSP page in a browser is given in Figure 9.1.   Figure 9.1. Displaying database records in a JSP page.      230      Note that you don't do any HTML encoding to the data returned by the getString method of the  ResultSet because you don't know yet how to write and use a method in a JSP page. If, for  example, the data contains something like  , this will ruin the display in the web browser.   When writing scriptlets, it is commonplace to interweave code with HTML tags, for writing  convenience. For instance, you can modify the while statement block of the code in Listing 9.4 to  the following:      while  rs.next    {  %>                                   <%   }   This is perfectly legal syntax.   Note   Switching from scriptlets to HTML tags and vice versa does not incur any performance  penalty. The code in Listing 9.4 can therefore be written into Listing 9.5.   Listing 9.5 JSP Page that Interweaves HTML Tags with Scriptlets           <%     try {      Class.forName "sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver" ;       231          System.out.println "JDBC driver loaded" ;     }     catch  ClassNotFoundException e  {      System.out.println e.toString   ;     }   %>            Display All Users                  Displaying All Users                     First Name     Last Name     User Name     Password          <%     String sql = "SELECT FirstName, LastName, UserName, Password" +       " FROM Users";     try {      Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:odbc:JavaWeb" ;         Statement s = con.createStatement  ;       ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery sql ;         while  rs.next    {   %>                                   <%       }       rs.close  ;       s.close  ;       con.close  ;     }     catch  SQLException e  {    }     catch  Exception e  {    }   %>                   Scriptlets alone are not sufficient to write efficient and effective JSP pages. As mentioned earlier,  you can't declare a method with scriptlets. Additionally, in the code in Listings 9.4 and 9.5, the  JSP page will try to load the JDBC driver every time the page is requested. This is unnecessary  because the page needs to load it only once. How do you run an initialization code as you do in  servlets? The answer is explained in the following section: declarations.      232      Declarations   Declarations allow you to declare methods and variables that can be used from any point in the  JSP page. Declarations also provide a way to create initialization and clean-up code by utilizing  the jspInit and jspDestroy methods.   A declaration starts with a   and can appear anywhere throughout the page.  For example, a method declaration can appear above a page directive that imports a class, even  though the class is used in the method.   The code in Listing 9.6 shows the use of declarations to declare a method called getSystemTime  and an integer i.   Listing 9.6 Using Declarations to Declare a Method and a Variable   <%!     String getSystemTime   {      return Calendar.getInstance  .getTime  .toString  ;     }   %>           <%     out.println "Current Time: " + getSystemTime   ;   %>        The resulting servlet follows. For clarity, some comments have been added to the code.   package org.apache.jsp;     import java.util.Calendar;   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import javax.servlet.jsp.*;   import javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.*;   import org.apache.jasper.runtime.*;       public class SimplePage_jsp extends HttpJspBase {         method declaration     String getSystemTime   {      return Calendar.getInstance  .getTime  .toString  ;     }        variable declaration     int i;       static {    }     public SimplePage_jsp   {    }       private static boolean _jspx_inited = false;       public final void _jspx_init   throws  org.apache.jasper.JasperException {    }         233        public void _jspService HttpServletRequest request,       HttpServletResponse  response        throws java.io.IOException, ServletException {         the content has been removed       .       .       .     }   }   See how the variable and method are added as a class-level variable and method in the servlet  class?   Having the capability to declare a method, I will present the example in Listings 9.4 and 9.5 to  also apply HTML encoding to the data from the database. The modified code is presented in  Listing 9.7.   Listing 9.7 JSP Page with a Method Declaration   <%!     String encodeHtmlTag String tag  {      if  tag == null          return null;       int length = tag.length  ;       StringBuffer encodedTag = new StringBuffer 2 * length ;       for  int i=0; i<length; i++  {        char c = tag.charAt i ;         if  c == '<'            encodedTag.append "<" ;         else if  c == '>'            encodedTag.append ">" ;         else if  c == '&'            encodedTag.append "&amp;" ;         else if  c == '"'            encodedTag.append "&quot;" ;             when trying to output text as tag's value as in              values="???".         else if  c == ' '            encodedTag.append "&nbsp;" ;         else           encodedTag.append c ;         }       return encodedTag.toString  ;     }   %>           <%     try {      Class.forName "sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver" ;       System.out.println "JDBC driver loaded" ;     }     catch  ClassNotFoundException e  {      System.out.println e.toString   ;     }   %>            Display All Users        234                    Displaying All Users                     First Name     Last Name     User Name     Password        <%     String sql = "SELECT FirstName, LastName, UserName, Password" +       " FROM Users";     try {      Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:odbc:JavaWeb" ;         Statement s = con.createStatement  ;       ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery sql ;         while  rs.next    {  %>                                   <%       }       rs.close  ;       s.close  ;       con.close  ;     }     catch  SQLException e  {      }     catch  Exception e  {    }   %>                   Writing Initialization and Clean-up Code   The code in Listings 9.4, 9.5, and 9.7 suffer from unnecessary repetition: The JSP page tries to  load the JDBC driver every time the page is called. This is just a small example. In real life, you  may have similar cases where you need to do initialization and clean-up; that is, you want a piece  of code to be run only when the JSP servlet is first initialized or when it is destroyed.   In Chapter 8, you learned that every servlet generated from a JSP page must directly or indirectly  implement the javax.servlet.jsp.JspPage interface. This interface has two methods: jspInit and  jspDestroy. The JSP container calls the jspInit the first time the JSP servlet is initialized and calls  the jspDestroy when the JSP servlet is about to be removed. These two methods provide a way for  initialization and clean-up code. With declarations, you can override these two methods.      235      You can now modify the code in Listing 9.7 by moving the part that loads the JDBC driver to the  jspInit method. The code is given in Listing 9.8.   Listing 9.8 Utilizing the jspInit Method   <%!     public void jspInit   {      try {        Class.forName "sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver" ;         System.out.println "JDBC driver loaded" ;       }       catch  ClassNotFoundException e  {        System.out.println e.toString   ;       }     }       String encodeHtmlTag String tag  {      if  tag == null          return null;       int length = tag.length  ;       StringBuffer encodedTag = new StringBuffer 2 * length ;       for  int i=0; i<length; i++  {        char c = tag.charAt i ;         if  c == '<'            encodedTag.append "<" ;         else if  c == '>'            encodedTag.append ">" ;         else if  c == '&'            encodedTag.append "&amp;" ;         else if  c == '"'            encodedTag.append "&quot;" ;             when trying to output text as tag's value as in              values="???".         else if  c == ' '            encodedTag.append "&nbsp;" ;         else           encodedTag.append c ;       }       return encodedTag.toString  ;     }       %>                    Display All Users                  Displaying All Users                     First Name     Last Name     User Name     Password        236          <%     String sql = "SELECT FirstName, LastName, UserName, Password" +       " FROM Users";     try {      Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:odbc:JavaWeb" ;         Statement s = con.createStatement  ;       ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery sql ;         while  rs.next    {  %>                                     <%       }       rs.close  ;       s.close  ;       con.close  ;     }     catch  SQLException e  {    }     catch  Exception e  {    }   %>                    The generated servlet is presented here. Note that some parts of the servlet code have been  removed for brevity.   public class SimplePage_jsp extends HttpJspBase {      public void jspInit   {      try {        Class.forName "sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver" ;         System.out.println "JDBC driver loaded" ;       }       catch  ClassNotFoundException e  {        System.out.println e.toString   ;       }     }       String encodeHtmlTag String tag  {      .       .       .     }       static {    }       public SimplePage_jsp   {    }       237          private static boolean _jspx_inited = false;     public final void _jspx_init   throws  org.apache.jasper.JasperException {    }       public void _jspService HttpServletRequest request,       HttpServletResponse  response        throws java.io.IOException, ServletException {          .         .         .     }   }   Expressions   Expressions are the last type of JSP scripting elements. Expressions get evaluated when the JSP  page is requested and their results are converted into a String and fed to the print method of the  out implicit object. If the result cannot be converted into a String, an error will be raised at  translation time. If this is not detected at translation time, at request-processing time, a  ClassCastException will be raised.   An expression starts with a  . You don't add a semicolon at the end of an  expression.   An example of an expression is given in Listing 9.9.   Listing 9.9 Using an Expression   Current Time:     This expression will be translated into the following statement in the _jspService method of the  generated servlet:   out.print  java.util.Calendar.getInstance  .getTime    ;   The expression in listing 9.9 is equivalent to the following scriptlet:   Current Time: <%  out.print java.util.Calendar.getInstance  .getTime   ; %>   As you can see, an expression is shorter because the return value is automatically fed into the  out.print.   As another example, the while block shown in Listing 9.8 can be re-written as follows using  expressions:   while  rs.next    {  %>                                       238                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       <%   }      Standard Action Elements   Standard action elements basically are tags that can be embedded into a JSP page. At compile time,  they also are replaced by Java code that corresponds to the predefined task.   The following is the list of JSP standard action elements:                               jsp:useBean  jsp:setProperty  jsp:getProperty  jsp:param  jsp:include  jsp:forward  jsp:plugin  jsp:params  jsp:fallback   jsp:include   The jsp:useBean, jsp:setProperty, and jsp:getProperty elements are related to Bean and are  discussed in Chapter 10, "Developing JSP Beans." The jsp:param element is used in the  jsp:include, jsp:forward, and jsp:plugin elements to provide information in the name value format,  and therefore will be discussed with the three other elements.   The jsp:include action element is used to incorporate static or dynamic resources into the current  page. This action element is similar to the include directive, but jsp:include provides greater  flexibility because you can pass information to the included resource.   The syntax for the jsp:include action element has two forms. For the jsp:include element that does  not have a parameter name value pair, the syntax is as follows:       If you want to pass information to the included resource, use the second syntax:              *       The page attribute represents the URL of the included resource in the local server. The flush  attribute indicates whether the buffer is flushed. In JSP 1.2, the value of the flush attribute must be  true.   In the second form, the * indicates that there can be zero or more elements in the brackets. This  means that you also can use this form even though you are not passing any information to the  included resource.   jsp:forward      239      The jsp:forward action element is used to terminate the execution of the current JSP page and  switch control to another resource. You can forward control either to a static resource or a  dynamic resource.   The syntax for the jsp:forward action element has two forms. For the jsp:forward element that  does not have a parameter name value pair, the syntax is as follows:       If you want to pass information to the included resource, use the second syntax:              *       The page attribute represents the URL of the included resource in the local server.   The jsp:plugin action element is used to generate HTML   or   tags  containing appropriate construct to instruct the browser to download the Java Plugin software, if  required, and initiates the execution of a Java applet or a JavaBeans component specified. This is  beyond the scope of this book and won't be discussed further.   The jsp:params action element can occur only as part of the   action and will not be  discussed in this book.   The jsp:fallback action element can occur only as part of the   action and will not be  discussed in this book.   jsp:plugin   jsp:params   jsp:fallback     Comments   Commenting is part of good programming practice. You can write two types of comments inside a  JSP page:      Comments that are to be displayed in the resulting HTML page at the client browser     Comments used in the JSP page itself   For comments that are meant to be displayed in the HTML page, you use the comments tags in  HTML. This kind of comment must be sent as normal text in a JSP page. For example, the  following code sends an HTML comment to the browser:   <%     out.println " " ;   %>   This is equivalent to the following:      240   For comments in the JSP page itself, you use the   tag pair. For example, here is a  JSP comment:   A JSP comment can contain anything except the closing tag. For example, this is an illegal  comment:          <%ââ     Here is a comment   ââ%>   <%ââ     Here is a comment ââ%>   ââ%>      Converting into XML Syntax   XML is getting more and more important in the computing world. JSP pages can be represented  using XML, and representing a JSP page as an XML document presents the following benefits:      The content of the JSP page can be validated against a set of descriptions.     The JSP page can be manipulated using an XML tool.     The JSP page can be generated from a textual representation by applying an XML   transformation.   Except for the standard action elements, the other JSP programming elements have been presented  using the alternative syntax throughout this chapter. This section will show you how non-XML  syntax can be converted into XML syntax to share the benefits presented earlier.   Directives   The non-XML syntax for a JSP directive takes the following form:       The XML syntax for a directive is as follows:       Scripting Elements   Declarations   The alternative syntax for a declaration is as follows:       This is equivalent to the following XML syntax:      241  A scripting element can be one of the following: declaration, scriptlet, or expression. The XML  syntax for each of the three is given in the following sections.       Scriptlets     declaration code     The alternative syntax for a scriptlet is as follows:       This is equivalent to the following XML syntax:     scriptlet code     Expressions   The alternative syntax for an expression is as follows:       This is equivalent to the following XML syntax:     expression     Template Data   The   XML tag is used to enclose template data in JSP. The syntax is as follows:     text        Summary   This chapter presents the JSP syntax and semantics, the language specification that you need to  master writing JSP pages. You have learned the three types of JSP elements: directives, scripting  elements, and action elements. You also have learned declarations, scripting elements, and action  elements, and have been shown how to use all of them. The last main section of the chapter,  "Converting into XML Syntax," presents a discussion on the importance of XML syntax as an  alternative for the   syntax and shows you how to convert the non-XML syntax into  XML equivalents.      242      Chapter 10. Developing JSP Beans   In Chapter 8, "JSP Basics," and Chapter 9, "JSP Syntax," you learned how you can write JSP  pages by interweaving HTML tags and Java code. Although this makes writing JSP pages easy  and straightforward, there are at least two disadvantages to this approach. First, the resulting  spaghetti-like page seriously lacks readability. Second, there is no separation of the presentation  and business rule implementation. To write a JSP page this way means a JSP author must master  both Java and HTML.   Versatility is not something very common in the real world, however. Finding a Java programmer  who also is good at HTML page design is as difficult as finding a graphic designer who is  proficient in Java. A separation of labor would be nice to have in developing a JSP application;  that is, let the graphic designer do the page design and the Java programmer author the code. In  JSP, this is possible through the use of JSP components, such as JavaBeans. In this component- centric approach, the Java programmer writes and compiles JavaBeans that incorporate all the  functionality needed in an application. While the programmer is doing this, the page designer can  work with the page design at the same time. When the JavaBeans are ready, the page designer  uses tags similar to HTML to call methods and properties of the beans from the JSP page.   In fact, using beans is a very common practice in JSP application development. This approach is  popular because JavaBeans introduces reusability. This is to say, rather than building your own  piece of code, you can simply use what other people have written. For example, you can purchase  a bean for file upload and start uploading files within 30 seconds.   Warning   Note that when you are designing a JavaBean for your JSP page, reusability and  modularity are of utmost importance. Therefore, it is not common to use a bean to send  HTML tags to the web browser because this makes the bean customized for that page. If  you need to achieve this task, you can use custom tags instead  this is the subject of  Chapter 11, "Using JSP Custom Tags."    In this chapter, you learn how to use JavaBeans in JSP pages. You start with a step-by-step  approach to quickly write a bean and call it from a JSP page. After you have the confidence that  you can comfortably write your own bean, you will look at how to use beans optimally in your  JSP page using the three action elements briefly mentioned in Chapter 9  jsp:useBean,  jsp:getProperty, and jsp:setProperty .       Calling Your Bean from a JSP Page   This section presents a step-by-step tutorial on how to write and deploy a simple bean called  CalculatorBean that is part of the com.brainysoftware package. After it is deployed, you then can  call the bean from a JSP page. In total, there are six steps you need to follow:   1.  Write a bean class whose code is given in Listing 10.1. Save it as CalculatorBean.java.   Listing 10.1 The CalculatorBean   package com.brainysoftware;   public class CalculatorBean {      243        public int doubleIt int number  {      return 2 * number;     }   }   The code has one public class called doubleIt that returns an integer as a result of  multiplication of the argument by 2.   2.  Compile the bean to obtain a class file called CalculatorBean.class.  3.  Copy the bean class file to the classes directory under WEB-INF under your application   directory. The deployment must take into account the package name. In this case, you  need to create a directory called com under the classes directory. Under com, create a  directory named brainysoftware. Copy your CalculatorBean.class file to this  brainysoftware directory.   Note   In Chapter 16, "Application Deployment," you will examine other ways of deploying  beans in a JSP application.   The directory structure is shown in Figure 10.1.   Figure 10.1. The directory structure for your bean class.   4.  Create a JSP page that will call the bean you just created. For this example, just use the   code in Listing 10.2.      Listing 10.2 Calling a Bean from Your JSP Page   <jsp:useBean id="theBean"  class="com.brainysoftware.CalculatorBean" >                   <%     int i = 4;     int j = theBean.doubleIt i ;     out.print "2*4=" + j ;   %>           5.  Restart Tomcat.  6.  Open and direct your browser to the URL of the JSP page your wrote in Step 4.   Your browser should display something like Figure 10.2.      244      Figure 10.2. Result from calling the bean from a JSP page.   Note   If your JavaBean comes in the form of a .jar file, copy the .jar file into the lib directory  under the WEB-INF directory of your application directory to make it available to JSP  pages in your application.   Now that you can write your own bean and call it from a JSP page, let's dig deeper into it          A Brief Theory of JavaBeans   This section presents JavaBeans briefly. You'll find a concise discussion hereâit's not meant to be  a comprehensive tutorial on the topic. JavaBeans have been discussed in dozens of Java books and  other online resources. For example, an excellent resource can be found at Sun's Java web site:   http:  java.sun.com docs books tutorial javabeans index.html.   Really, a bean is just a Java class. You don't need to extend any base class or implement any  interface. To be a bean, however, a Java class must follow certain rules specified by the JavaBeans  specification. In relation to JavaBeans that can be used from a JSP page, these rules are as follows:      The bean class must have a no-argument constructor. In the bean in Listing 10.1, the class   does not have a constructor at all. This still is legal because the Java compiler will  automatically create a no-argument constructor for any Java class that does not have a  constructor.      Optionally, a bean can have a public method that can be used to set the value of a   property. This method is called a setter method. The method does not return any value,      245      and its name starts with "set" followed by the name of the property. A setter method has  the following signature:   public void setPropertyName  PropertyType value ;   For example, the setter method for the property operand must be named setOperand. Note  that the spelling for the property name is not exactly the same. A property name starts  with a lowercase letter, but the name of the setter uses an uppercase letter after "set";  hence setOperand.      Optionally, a bean can have a public method that can be called to obtain the value of a  property. This method is called a getter method, and its return type is the same as the  property type. Its name must begin with "get"; followed by the name of the property. A  getter method has the following signature:   public PropertyType getPropertyName  ;   As an example, the getter method for the property named operand is getOperand. A  property name starts with a lowercase letter, but the name of the getter uses an uppercase  letter after "get;" hence getOperand.   Both setter and getter methods are known as access methods. In JSP, the jsp:getProperty and  jsp:setProperty action elements are used to invoke a getter and a setter method, respectively. You  can call these methods the same way you call an ordinary method, however.       Making a Bean Available   Before you can use a bean in your JSP page, you must make the bean available, using the  jsp:useBean action element. This element has attributes that you can use to control the bean's  behavior. The syntax for the jsp:useBean element has two forms. The first form is used when you  don't need to write any initialization code, and the second form is used if you have Java code that  needs to be run when the bean initializes. Code initialization is discussed in the next section.   The two forms of the jsp:useBean action element are as follows:       and         initialization code       The  attribute="value" + part of the code means that one or more attributes must be present. The  five attributes that can be used in a jsp:useBean action element are as follows:   id  class  type  scope  beanName                      246   Either the class attribute or the type attribute must be present.   The five attributes are explained in the following sections.   The id attribute defines a unique identifier for the bean. This identifier can be used throughout the  page and can be thought of as the object reference for the bean. The value for the id attribute has  the same requirements as a valid variable name in the current scripting language.   The class attribute specifies the fully qualified name for the JavaBean class. A fully qualified  name is not required if the bean's package is imported using the page directive, however.   If the type attribute is present in a jsp:useBean element, it specifies the type of the JavaBean class.  The type of the bean could be the type of the class itself, the type of its superclass, or an interface  the bean class implements. Normally, this attribute isn't often used.   The scope attribute defines the accessibility and the life span of the bean. This attribute can take  one of the following values:                page  request  session  application   The default value of the scope attribute is page.   The scope is a powerful feature that lets you control how long the bean will continue to exist.  Each of the attribute values is discussed in the following sections.   Using the page attribute value, the bean is available only in the current page after the point where  the jsp:useBean action element is used. A new instance of the bean will be instantiated every time  the page is requested. The bean will be automatically destroyed after the JSP page loses its scope;  namely, when the control moves to another page. If you use the jsp:include or jsp:forward tags,  the bean will not be accessible from the included or forwarded page.   With the request attribute value, the accessibility of the bean is extended to the forwarded or  included page referenced by a jsp:forward or jsp:include action element. The forwarded or  included page can use the bean without having a jsp:useBean action element. For example, from  inside a forwarded or included page, you can use the jsp:getProperty and jsp:setProperty action  elements that reference to the bean instantiated in the original page.      id   class   type   scope   page   request   session      247      application   beanName   A bean with a session scope is placed in the user's session object. The instance of the bean will  continue to exist as long as the user's session object exists. In other words, the bean's accessibility  extends to other pages.   Because the bean's instance is put in the session object, you cannot use this scope if the page on  which the bean is instantiated does not participate in the JSP container's session management. For  example, the following code will generate an error:       <jsp:useBean id="theBean" scope="session"     class="com.brainysoftware.CalculatorBean" >   A bean with an application scope lives throughout the life of the JSP container itself. It is available  from any page in the application.   The beanName attribute represents a name for the bean that the instantiate method of the  java.beans.Beans class expects.   As an example, the following is a jsp:useBean that instantiates the bean called  com.newriders.HomeLoanBean:       Alternatively, you can import the package com.newriders using a page directive and refer to the  class using its name, as follows:           Note   The Generated Servlet   The bean is available in the page after the jsp:useBean action element. It is not available  before that point.   The jsp:useBean action element causes the JSP container to generate Java code that loads the  bean's class. Let's now examine the generated servlet.   Consider again the JSP page that uses a bean in Listing 10.1:   <jsp:useBean id="theBean" scope="page"     class="com.brainysoftware.CalculatorBean" >   <%     int i = 4;     int j = theBean.doubleIt i ;     out.println "2*4=" + j ;   %>   If you open the generated servlet class file, you will see that some code is added to the _jspService  method that translates the jsp:useBean action element.      248                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       public void _jspService HttpServletRequest request,     HttpServletResponse  response      throws java.io.IOException, ServletException {      JspFactory _jspxFactory = null;     PageContext pageContext = null;     HttpSession session = null;     ServletContext application = null;     ServletConfig config = null;     JspWriter out = null;     Object page = this;     String  _value = null;       try {      if  _jspx_inited == false  {        synchronized  this  {          if  _jspx_inited == false  {            jspx_init  ;             _jspx_inited = true;           }         }       }       _jspxFactory = JspFactory.getDefaultFactory  ;       response.setContentType "text html;charset=ISO-8859-1" ;       pageContext = _jspxFactory.getPageContext         this, request, response, "", true, 8192, true ;         application = pageContext.getServletContext  ;       config = pageContext.getServletConfig  ;       session = pageContext.getSession  ;       out = pageContext.getOut  ;            an object reference to the Bean       com.brainysoftware.CalculatorBean theBean = null;       boolean _jspx_specialtheBean  = false;       synchronized  pageContext  {        theBean =  com.brainysoftware.CalculatorBean            pageContext.getAttribute "theBean",PageContext.PAGE_SCOPE ;         if   theBean == null   {          _jspx_specialtheBean = true;           try {            theBean =  com.brainysoftware.CalculatorBean                 java.beans.Beans.instantiate this.getClass  .getClassLoader  ,                 "com.brainysoftware.CalculatorBean" ;           }           catch  Exception exc  {            throw new ServletException                " Cannot create bean of class" +               "com.brainysoftware.CalculatorBean", exc ;           }           pageContext.setAttribute "theBean", theBean,  PageContext.PAGE_SCOPE ;         }       }       if _jspx_specialtheBean == true  {      }       out.write "\r\n" ;       int i = 4;       int j = theBean.doubleIt i ;       out.println "2*4=" + j ;        249          }       catch  Throwable t  {        if  out != null && out.getBufferSize   != 0            out.clearBuffer  ;         if  pageContext != null  pageContext.handlePageException t ;       }       finally {        if  _jspxFactory != null   _jspxFactory.releasePageContext pageContext ;       }     }   The most important line of code in the generated servlet is the one that instantiates the bean and  casts it to the bean's class type:   theBean =  com.brainysoftware.CalculatorBean      java.beans.Beans.instantiate this.getClass  .getClassLoader  ,       "com.brainysoftware.CalculatorBean" ;   See how the jsp:useBean action element is translated into the instantiate method of  java.beans.Beans?   Also note that the generated servlet will be slightly different if you use a different scope for the  bean. To be more precise, the getAttribute and setAttribute methods of the PageContext class will  be passed a scope according to the scope used for the bean. For instance, if the bean has an  application scope, APPLICATION_SCOPE will be used instead of PAGE_SCOPE. If the bean  has a session scope, SESSION_SCOPE will be used.       Accessing Properties Using jsp:getProperty and  jsp:setProperty   In accessing a property in a bean, you can conveniently use the jsp:getProperty and jsp:setProperty  action elements. The jsp:getProperty element is used to obtain the value of an internal variable,  and the bean must provide a getter method. The syntax of the jsp:getProperty element is as follows:       The name attribute must be assigned the name of the bean instance from which the property value  will be obtained. The property attribute must be assigned the name of the property.   A jsp:getProperty element returns the property value converted into String. The return value is  then automatically fed into an out.print method so it will be displayed in the current JSP page.   The jsp:setProperty action element is used to set the value of a property. Its syntax has four forms:   <jsp:setProperty name="Bean Name" property="PropertyName"  value="value" >           <jsp:setProperty name="Bean Name" property="PropertyName"   param="parameterName" >         250          In all the forms, the name attribute is assigned the name of the bean instance available in the  current JSP page. In this section, however, you learn about and use only the first form. The other  three forms will be explained in the next section, "Setting a Property Value from a Request."   In the first form of the syntax, the property attribute is assigned the name of the property whose  value is to be set, and the value attribute is assigned the value of the property.   The following example demonstrates the use of the jsp:getProperty and jsp:setProperty action  elements.   Consider the bean called CalculatorBean in the com.brainysoftware package in Listing 10.3. It has  a private integer called memory.  Note that the variable name starts with a lowercase m.  It also  has a getter called getMemory and a setter named setMemory. Note that in both accessor methods,  memory is spelled using an uppercase M.   Listing 10.3 The CalculatorBean with Accessors   package com.brainysoftware;   public class CalculatorBean {    private int memory;       public void setMemory int number  {      memory = number;     }       public int getMemory   {      return memory;     }     public int doubleIt int number  {      return 2 * number;     }   }   Using the jsp:setProperty and jsp:getProperty action elements, you can set and obtain the value of  memory, as demonstrated in the JSP page in Listing 10.4.   Listing 10.4 Accessing the Property Using jsp:setProperty and jsp:getProperty           The value of memory is <jsp:getProperty name="theBean"  property="memory" >   Calling this page in a web browser, you should be able to see something similar to Figure 10.3.   Figure 10.3. Calling the accessor in the bean.      251         As shown in Figure 10.3, the result of the jsp:getProperty is displayed on the current JSP page.   Note that you also can access the accessor methods in a conventional way, as described in Listing  10.5.   Listing 10.5 Calling Accessor Methods Like Ordinary Methods       <%     theBean.setMemory 987 ;   %>   The value of memory is     In many cases, it is also common to use an expression as the value of the value attribute. For  example, the code in Listing 10.6 feeds a JSP expression to the value attribute in a jsp:setProperty  action element.   Listing 10.6 Feeding a JSP Expression to the Value Attribute       <%     int i = 2;   %>   <jsp:setProperty name="theBean" property="memory" value="<%= 100 * i  %>" >   The value of memory is <jsp:getProperty name="theBean"  property="memory" >      Setting a Property Value from a Request      252      You can use a more concise way of setting a property value using the jsp:setProperty action  element if the value happens to come from the Request object's parameter s . In fact, there are  three forms of syntax, as discussed in the previous section. The three forms are re-written here:   <jsp:setProperty name="Bean Name" property="PropertyName"   param="parameterName" >               The first form allows you to assign a Request object parameter value to a property. The param  attribute of the jsp:setProperty action element must be assigned the name of the Request object's  parameter name. The following example demonstrates the use of this form. The example has two  pages. The first page is a simple HTML with a form containing a Text box into which the user can  enter a number. The code for this page is shown in Listing 10.7.   Listing 10.7 The Page Where the User Can Type a Number            Passing a value                Please type in a number in the box                                     Note that the TEXT element name is memory and the form is passed to a JSP page called  SimplePage.jsp. The SimplePage.jsp is given in Listing 10.8.   Listing 10.8 The SimplePage.jsp Page           The value of memory is <jsp:getProperty name="theBean"  property="memory" >   If the parameter name is the same as the bean's property name, you can even omit the param  attribute:       This is, of course, the third form of the jsp:setProperty syntax.   The last form allows you to assign the values of Request object's parameters to multiple properties  in a bean as long as the names of the properties are the same as the parameter names. The second  line in Listing 10.8 can be replaced with the following:          253          JavaBeans Code Initialization   The jsp:useBean action element allows you to write code that will be executed after the bean is  initialized. For a bean that has a page scope, the initialization code is run every time the JSP page  is requested.   Initialization code can be as simple as writing a piece of text, such as the following:   <jsp:useBean id="theBean" scope="page"     class="com.brainysoftware.CalculatorBean">     Initializing the Bean       Remember that any template data will be translated into an argument to an out.print method. It's  not hard to guess that the initialization code will be added to the code block that instantiates the  bean. Consider the following _ jspService method of the servlet generated from the previous JSP  page. The method has been cleaned up for clarity:   public void _jspService HttpServletRequest request,     HttpServletResponse  response      throws java.io.IOException, ServletException {      JspFactory _jspxFactory = null;     PageContext pageContext = null;     HttpSession session = null;     ServletContext application = null;     ServletConfig config = null;     JspWriter out = null;     Object page = this;     String  _value = null;     try {      .       .       .       com.brainysoftware.CalculatorBean theBean = null;       .       .       .       synchronized  pageContext  {        theBean =  com.brainysoftware.CalculatorBean            pageContext.getAttribute "theBean",PageContext.PAGE_SCOPE ;         if   theBean == null   {          _jspx_specialtheBean = true;           try {            theBean =  com.brainysoftware.CalculatorBean                 java.beans.Beans.instantiate this.getClass  .getClassLoader  ,               "com.brainysoftware.CalculatorBean" ;           }           catch  Exception exc  {            throw new ServletException  " Cannot create bean of class "               +"com.brainysoftware.CalculatorBean", exc ;           }           pageContext.setAttribute "theBean", theBean,  PageContext.PAGE_SCOPE ;       254            }       }       if _jspx_specialtheBean == true  {            here is the initialization code         out.write "\r\nInitializing the Bean\r\n" ;         }     }     catch  Throwable t  {      .       .       .     }     finally {      .       .       .     }   }   At the time of initialization, you even can use the jsp:setProperty action element to set the value of  a bean's property, as demonstrated in the code in Listing 10.9.   Listing 10.9 Using jsp:setProperty in a Bean's Initialization Code                  The SQLToolBean Example   I will now present an example bean that can be used as a tool to execute an SQL statement in a  database server. This code is a modification of the SQLToolServlet presented in Chapter 4,  "Accessing Databases with JDBC." Instead of a servlet, you now have a JavaBean.   The example consists of a bean class and two JSP pages. The first JSP page, Login.jsp, is used to  obtain the user name and password for the database user authentication. It consists of an HTML  form with two TEXT elementsâone for the user name and one for the password.   After the form is submitted, the user name and password will be passed as properties to the bean  in the second JSP page, SQLTool.jsp. The values of the user name and password will also be  preserved in two hidden fields in the form in the SQLTool.jsp page. When the form is submitted,  the values of the user name and password are passed back to the server. This way, a user needs to  log in only once.

The  first three are used to obtain a Connection object to the database server, whereas sql is the SQL  statement to be executed by the server. The userName, password, and sql have a getter and setter  method of their own, whereas the connectionUrl only has a setter.   public String getSql   {    return StringUtil.encodeHtmlTag sql ;   }     public void setSql String sql  {    if  sql != null        this.sql = sql;   }     public void setUserName String userName  {    if  userName != null        this.userName = userName;   }     public String getUserName   {    return StringUtil.encodeHtmlTag userName ;   }     public void setPassword String password  {    if  password != null        this.password = password;   }     public String getPassword   {    return StringUtil.encodeHtmlTag password ;   }     public void setConnectionUrl String url  {    connectionUrl = url;   }   The only method the bean has is the getResult method. For an SQL statement, the return value of  this method is a String containing an HTML table. For other types of SQL statements, this method  returns the number of records affected by the SQL statement.   Used in various places in the SQLToolBean is the encodeHtmlTag method of the  com.brainysoftware.java.StringUtil class. This method encodes a String so that characters with  special meanings in HTML are converted to their equivalents. This class is included in the jar file  in the CD that accompanies this book. However, you also can copy and paste the encodeHtmlTag  method so that you don't have to depend on the jar file. This method is given in Listing 10.11.   Listing 10.11 The encodeHtmlTag Method   public static String encodeHtmlTag String tag  {    if  tag == null        return null;     int length = tag.length  ;     StringBuffer encodedTag = new StringBuffer 2 * length ;     for  int i=0; i<length; i++  {      char c = tag.charAt i ;       if  c == '<'        259            encodedTag.append "<" ;       else if  c == '>'          encodedTag.append ">" ;       else if  c == '&'          encodedTag.append "&amp;" ;       else if  c == '"'          encodedTag.append "&quot;" ;    when trying to output text as  tag's            value as in values="???".       else if  c == ' '          encodedTag.append "&nbsp;" ;       else         encodedTag.append c ;       }     return encodedTag.toString  ;   }   As discussed in Chapter 4, you need to load the JDBC driver from which you can get a database  connection. The JDBC driver needs to be loaded only once, and the code that loads it is given as  the initialization code of the bean.   The login page for this application is shown in Listing 10.12.   Listing 10.12 The Login.jsp Page            Login Page                               User Name:                       Password:                                                            This is basically a static HTML that can be safely converted into an HTML page to avoid any  processing by the JSP container.   When the form in the HTML page is submitted, the request is passed to the SQLTool.jsp page.  This page is given in Listing 10.13.   Listing 10.13 The SQLTool.jsp Page      260          <%     try {      Class.forName "sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver" ;     }     catch  Exception e  {      out.println e.toString   ;     }   %>               <jsp:setProperty name="theBean" property="connectionUrl"   value="jdbc:odbc:JavaWeb" >                SQL Tool              SQL Tool     Please type your SQL statement in the following box.            <INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=userName VALUE="<jsp:getProperty  name="theBean"   property="userName" >">   <INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=password VALUE="<jsp:getProperty  name="theBean"   property="password" >">                                                   First, this code initializes the SQLToolBean using the jsp:useBean action element. Included as the  bean initialization code is the code that loads the JDBC driver:       <%     try {      Class.forName "sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver" ;     }     catch  Exception e  {      out.println e.toString   ;     }   %>       Next, it sets the properties of the Bean:           261          <jsp:setProperty name="theBean" property="connectionUrl"     value="jdbc:odbc:JavaWeb" >       Note that, except for the connectionUrl property, all property values come from the request object.   The values are written as hidden values and obtained using the jsp:getProperty action elements.  Here is the form in the SQLTool.jsp page:       <INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=userName VALUE="<jsp:getProperty  name="theBean"   property="userName" >">   <INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=password VALUE="<jsp:getProperty  name="theBean"   property="password" >">                           When you view the source code of the resulting HTML page, you should be able to see that the  user name and password are preserved to be submitted again to the server when the user submits  the form:            SQL Tool              SQL Tool     Please type your SQL statement in the following box.                                                                   Summary   This chapter presents the component-centric architecture of a JSP page, a preferable approach  offering several advantages over JSP pages that mix template data and elements. The advantages      262      are more readability, separation of presentation and business rule implementation, and code  reusability.   You have learned how to write your own bean and run it with Tomcat. You now also know the  various scopes of a bean and how to set and obtain the value of a bean property using the  jsp:setProperty and jsp:getProperty action elements.      263              Chapter 11. Using JSP Custom Tags   Using JavaBeans, you can separate the presentation part of a JSP page from the business rule  implementation  Java code . However, only three action elementsâjsp:useBean, jsp:getProperty,  and jsp:setPropertyâare available for accessing a bean. As such, in some situations, we have to  resort to using code in a JSP page. In other words, oftentimes JavaBeans don't offer complete  separation of presentation and business rule implementation.   Take Listing 10.13, from the previous chapter, as an example. Even though the JSP page consists  mainly of tags, we still need to write some Java code as initialization code for the bean. This part  of Listing 10.13 is reproduced here for reading convenience.       <%     try {      Class.forName "sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver" ;     }     catch  Exception e  {      out.println e.toString   ;     }   %>       In other parts of Listing 10.13, everything is represented by a tag, except when we need to call the  getResult method of the bean, in which case we use a JSP expressionâas in the following code  fragment.       Also, JavaBeans are designed with reusability in mind, meaning that using a bean to output  HTML tags directly is not recommended. Outputting HTML tags from a bean makes the Bean  useable only from a certain page, even though there are always exceptions to this rule.   In recognition of the imperfection of JavaBeans as a solution to separation of presentation and  business rule implementation, JSP 1.1 defined a new feature: custom tags that can be used to  perform custom actions.   Custom tags offer some benefits that are not present in JavaBeans. Among others, custom tags  have access to all the objects available to JSP pages, and custom tags can be customized using  attributes. However, custom tags are not meant to replace JavaBeans completely or make the use  of JavaBeans in JSP pages obsolete. JavaBeans have their own fans, too. As you can see,  sometimes it is more appropriate to use beans for their reusability, and sometimes it is better to use  custom tags. In some circumstances, the choice whether to use JavaBeans or custom tags is not  really clear, leaving you with a decision to make based on your experience.   In this chapter, we explore another great feature of JSP: custom tags. It will begin with writing a  JSP page that uses custom tags, deploy the small application with Tomcat, and run it in your web  browser. After this experience, we start diving deep into the details of the underlying APIâthe  classes and interfaces in the javax.servlet.jsp.tagext package. We then create more examples based  on those classes and interfaces.   264      Writing Your First Custom Tag   This section demonstrates the use of custom tags in a JSP page. As usual, you are encouraged to  quickly build a small application, deploy it in Tomcat, and call the page from a web browser. For  this example, we build a Java component that sends the following String to the browser: "Hello  from the custom tag."   This section also presents the step-by-step approach to building a JSP application that uses custom  tags.   Before we start developing the application, Figure 11.1 shows the directory structure of our JSP  application called myJSPApp. You need to complete the directory structure if you have not done  so in the previous chapters.   Figure 11.1. The directory structure of the application.      1.  Create a TLD file named taglib.tld, as shown in Listing 11.1, and save it in the WEB-INF   Now, follow the following five easy steps.   directory.   Listing 11.1 The TLD File      <!DOCTYPE taglib PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD JSP Tag  Library 1.1  EN"  "http:  java.sun.com j2ee dtds webjsptaglibrary_1_1.dtd">         265       1.0           myTag    com.brainysoftware.MyCustomTag< t  agclass>           2.  Write, compile, and deploy the Java class called MyCustomTag.java given in Listing 11.2.   Make sure that the .class file is located in the brainysoftware directory, under WEB- INF classes com  directory.   Listing 11.2 The MyCustomTag.java   package com.brainysoftware;   import javax.servlet.jsp.*;   import javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.*;     public class MyCustomTag extends TagSupport {      public int doEndTag   throws JspException {      JspWriter out = pageContext.getOut  ;       try {        out.println "Hello from the custom tag." ;       }       catch  Exception e  {      }       return super.doEndTag  ;     }   }   3.  Create a JSP file from the code given in Listing 11.3. Call it SimplePage.jsp and save it   under the myJSPApp directory.   Listing 11.3 The SimplePage.jsp Page           4.  Edit your deployment descriptor  web.xml  file. To use custom tags, you must specify a     element in your web.xml file. The   element must appear after the    and   if any. An example of the deployment descriptor is  given in Listing 11.4.   Listing 11.4 The Deployment Descriptor for This Application   <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application  2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">            template                myTLD          WEB-INF taglib.tld        266                5.  Restart Tomcat.   Open your web browser and type http:  localhost:8080 myJSPApp SimplePage.jsp in the  Address box. You should see something similar to Figure 11.2.   Figure 11.2. A simple JSP page.   Figure 11.3 shows how all the parts work.   Figure 11.3. The relationship between the deployment descriptor, the JSP   page, and the TDL file.         When the user requests the JSP page, the JSP container sees the   tag. Because of this, the  JSP container knows that it is seeing a custom tag. It then:      267         Consults the deployment descriptor  web.xml  to find the location of the taglib where the  URI is " myTLD". The deployment descriptor returns the path to the TLD file. The JSP  container will remember this path.      Continues processing the next line and encounters the custom tag myTag, prefixed by   "easy". Having found out the name and location of the TLD file, the JSP container reads  the TLD file and obtains the fully qualified name of the Java class for the tag myTag. It  reads: com.brainysoftware.MyCustomTag.   The JSP container can then load the class for the tag and start processing it.   The generated servlet is not that complicated, as you see here:   package org.apache.jsp;     import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import javax.servlet.jsp.*;   import javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.*;   import org.apache.jasper.runtime.*;       public class SimplePage_jsp extends HttpJspBase {      static {    }       public SimplePage_jsp   {    }       private static boolean _jspx_inited = false;       public final void _jspx_init   throws  org.apache.jasper.JasperException {    }       public void _jspService HttpServletRequest request,       HttpServletResponse  response        throws java.io.IOException, ServletException {        JspFactory _jspxFactory = null;       PageContext pageContext = null;       HttpSession session = null;       ServletContext application = null;       ServletConfig config = null;       JspWriter out = null;       Object page = this;       String  _value = null;       try {        if  _jspx_inited == false  {          synchronized  this  {            if  _jspx_inited == false  {              _jspx_init  ;               _jspx_inited = true;             }           }         }         _jspxFactory = JspFactory.getDefaultFactory  ;         response.setContentType "text html;charset=ISO-8859-1" ;         pageContext = _jspxFactory.getPageContext this, request,           response, "", true, 8192, true ;       268                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®             application = pageContext.getServletContext  ;         config = pageContext.getServletConfig  ;         session = pageContext.getSession  ;         out = pageContext.getOut  ;         out.write "\r\n" ;          * ââââ  easy:myTag ââââ *          com.brainysoftware.MyCustomTag _jspx_th_easy_myTag_0 =           new com.brainysoftware.MyCustomTag  ;         _jspx_th_easy_myTag_0.setPageContext pageContext ;         _jspx_th_easy_myTag_0.setParent null ;         try {          int _jspx_eval_easy_myTag_0 =  _jspx_th_easy_myTag_0.doStartTag  ;           if  _jspx_eval_easy_myTag_0 == BodyTag.EVAL_BODY_BUFFERED              throw new JspTagException "Since tag handler class" +             " com.brainysoftware.MyCustomTag does not implement  BodyTag," + " it can't return BodyTag.EVAL_BODY_TAG" ;           if  _jspx_eval_easy_myTag_0 != Tag.SKIP_BODY  {            do {            }             while  _jspx_th_easy_myTag_0.doAfterBody   ==               BodyTag.EVAL_BODY_AGAIN ;           }           if  _jspx_th_easy_myTag_0.doEndTag   == Tag.SKIP_PAGE              return;           }           finally {            _jspx_th_easy_myTag_0.release  ;           }         out.write "\r\n" ;       }       catch  Throwable t  {        if  out != null && out.getBufferSize   != 0            out.clearBuffer  ;         if  pageContext != null            pageContext.handlePageException t ;       }       finally {        if  _jspxFactory != null            _jspxFactory.releasePageContext pageContext ;       }     }   }   Having seen a custom tag in action, you are now ready to dissect componenti-zation using custom  tags bit by bit. Let's start with the easiest partâthe deployment descriptor.     The Role of the Deployment Descriptor   The preceding example illustrates how the JSP container can find the name and location of the  TLD file by looking up the deployment descriptor.   Even though this is a common practice, you can eliminate the role of the deployment descriptor by  writing the name and location of the TLD file directly on the JSP page. Therefore, the code in  Listing 11.3 can be replaced with the code in Listing 11.5.      269      Listing 11.5 An Alternative JSP Page for the Application           However, directly referring to the TLD file lacks the flexibility to move and change the name of  the TLD file without having to edit all the JSP pages that utilize it.   Therefore, indirect reference of the TLD file involving the deployment descriptor is preferable.   Note   Note that in all examples in this chapter, the taglib tag's URI attribute is assigned to   myTLD. It is assumed you have edited the web.xml file accordingly.       The Tag Library Descriptor   A tag library descriptor  TLD  file is an XML document that defines a tag library and its tags. The  first lines of a TLD file are the standard XML header information, as follows:       <!DOCTYPE taglib     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD JSP Tag Library 1.1  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com j2ee dtds web-jsptaglibrary_1_1.dtd">   A TLD file contains the   root element. This element can have the following subelements:                      tlibversion  jspversion  shortname  info  uri  tag   Of these six elements, the tag element is the only one that can have attributes. However, the  tlibversion, shortname, and tag are required in the TLD file.   The tlibversion element specifies the version number of the tag library in the following format:    [0-9] *  "." [0-9] ?  "." [0-9] ?  "." [0-9] ?   The asterisk means that the values in the bracket can be repeated zero or more times, and the  question mark means that the value in the bracket is optional. The following are some valid values  for a tlibversion element: 1.1.1.1, 2, 2.3, 3.3.6, and so on.   The jspversion element specifies the JSP version. The format is the same as the tlibversion  element.    [0-9] *  "." [0-9] ?  "." [0-9] ?  "." [0-9] ?      270      The shortname element specifies a short name for the tag library. The value for this element must  begin with a letter and must not contain blank space.   The info element contains the information used for documentation purposes. Its default value is an  empty string.   The uri element specifies the link to an additional source of documentation for the tag library.   The tag element is the most important element in a tag library. You can specify more than one tag  element in the same TLD file. Therefore, you only have one TLD file for each JSP application.  The tag element is explained in more detail in the following section.   The following is an example of a TLD file:       <!DOCTYPE taglib     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD JSP Tag Library 1.1  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com j2ee dtds web-jsptaglibrary_1_1.dtd">          1.0.123.123.234       1.2              Example tags                      myTag         com.brainysoftware.MyCustomTag                   number           true                           power           true                      The tag element specifies a custom tag in the library. This element can have six subelements:   The tag Element                      name  tagclass  teiclass  bodycontent  info  attribute   Of these six tag subelements, name and tagclass are mandatory.   The name element specifies an identifier for the tag.   The tagclass element specifies the fully qualified name of the Java class that handles the  processing of this tag.      271      The teiclass element specifies the helper class for this tag, if there is one. tei is short for  TagExtraInfo, the name of a class in the javax.servlet.jsp.tagext package. TagExtraInfo is  explained in more detail later in this chapter when we discuss the API.   The bodycontent element specifies the type of the body content of the tag, if any. A body content  is what appears between the opening and closing tags. This element can have one of the following  values: empty, JSP, or tagdepen-dent. The empty value means that there is no body content  supported by the tag. Assigning "JSP" as the value of the bodycontent element indicates that the  body content values are one or more JSP elements. The last value, tagdepen-dent, indicates that  the tag's body is to be interpreted by the tag.   The info element of the tag element contains an informational description.   The attribute element specifies zero or more attributes. The attribute element can have three  subelements: name, required, and rtextprvalue. Only name is a required subelement of the attribute.   The name subelement is the identification for the attribute. The required subelement indicates  whether the attribute is mandatory and can take a value of true or false, with false as the default  value.   The rtexprvalue subelement indicates whether the value for this attribute can be determined at  request time. If the value of this subelement is true, you can assign a request time value such as a  JSP expression.       The Custom Tag Syntax   To use a custom tag in a JSP page, you first need to use a taglib directive in your page. The taglib  directive has the following syntax:       The uri attribute specifies an absolute or relative URI that uniquely identifies the tag library  descriptor associated with this prefix.   The prefix attribute defines a string that will become the prefix to distinguish a custom action.   With a taglig directive, you then can use a custom tag of the following format for a custom tag that  does not have a content body:       Or, you can use the following format for a custom tag that has a content body:    body    You can pass attributes to the tag handler by specifying the attribute s  in the custom tag, each  with the following format:   attributeName="attributeValue"      272      The following example is a custom tag whose prefix is m and whose name is myTag. The tag has  two attributes: number with a value of 12, and power with a value of 13.       Note   Note that an attribute value must be quoted.       The JSP Custom Tag API   A tag handler is the Java class that is linked to a custom tag and gets invoked every time the JSP  container encounters the custom tag. The tag handler is so named because it handles the  processing of the tag. To be functional, a tag handler must implement an interface in the  javax.servlet.jsp.tagext package or extend one of the classes in the same package.   In JSP 1.2, the javax.servlet.jsp.tagext has four interfaces and twelve classes, four more members  than the same package in the JSP 1.1 specification. Some of the members of the  javax.servlet.jsp.tagext package are explained here. For a complete reference of this package, see  Appendix E, "The javax.servlet.jsp.tagext Package Reference."   The two most important interfaces are Tag and BodyTag. These two interfaces also set the life  cycle of a tag handler. Either Tag or BodyTag must be implemented by a tag handler, either  directly or indirectly.   Tag handlers that implement the Tag interface must provide implementations for all the interface's  methods. These methods are as follows:   The Tag Interface                      doStartTag  doEndTag  getParent  setParent  setPageContext  release   You can write a tag handler by simply implementing the Tag interface and providing blank  implementations of all its six methods. For example, the code in Listing 11.6 is a tag handler  called BasicTagHandler that does not do anything.   Listing 11.6 A Simple Tag Handler that Does Not Do Anything   package com.brainysoftware;     import javax.servlet.jsp.*;   import javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.*;     public class BasicTagHandler implements Tag {      public void setParent Tag t  {    }       273          public void setPageContext PageContext p  {    }       public void release   {    }       public Tag getParent   {      return null;     }       public int doStartTag   {      return EVAL_BODY_INCLUDE;     }       public int doEndTag   {      return EVAL_PAGE;     }   }   Note that both doStartTag and doEndTag return an integer. Their return values are one of the four  static final integers defined in the Tag interface: SKIP_BODY, EVAL_BODY_INCLUDE,  SKIP_PAGE, and EVAL_PAGE. Tag.SKIP_BODY and Tag.EVAL_BODY_INCLUDE are valid  return values of the doStartTag method, whereas Tag.SKIP_PAGE and Tag.EVAL_PAGE are  valid return values of the doEndTag method.       The Life Cycle of a Tag Handler   The life cycle of a tag handler that implements the Tag interface is controlled by the JSP container  by calling the methods in the following order:   1.  The JSP container obtains an instance of the tag handler from the pool or creates a new  one. It then calls the setPageContext, passing a PageContext object representing the JSP  page where the custom tag is found. If you want to access the JSP page, you need to  assign this PageContext object to an object reference that has class scope. The  setPageContext method has the following signature:   public void setPageContext PageContext pageContext    2.  The JSP container then calls the setParent method. This method passes a tag object, which   represents the closest tag enclosing the current tag handler. If there is no enclosing tag, a  null object reference is passed.   The signature of the setParent method is as follows:   public void setParent Tag parent    3.  The JSP container then sets all the attributes in the custom tag, if any. Attributes are   handled like properties in a JavaBean, namely by using the getter and setter methods. For  example, if the custom tag has an attribute named temperature, the getter is called  getTemperature and the setter is called setTemperature. The JSP container calls all the  available setter methods to set attribute values.   4.  Next, the JSP container calls the doStartTag, whose signature is as follows:      274      public int doStartTag   throws javax.servlet.jsp.JspException   The doStartTag method can return either Tag.SKIP_BODY and  Tag.EVAL_BODY_INCLUDE. If Tag.SKIP_BODY is returned, the JSP container will  not process the tag's body contents, if any. If the doStartTag method returns  Tag.EVAL_BODY_INCLUDE, the body contents, if any, will be processed normally.   5.  Regardless of the return value of the doStartTag method, the JSP container next calls the   doEndTag method. This method has the following signature:   public int doEndTag   throws javax.servlet.jsp.JspException   The doEndTag method returns either Tag.SKIP_PAGE or Tag.EVAL_PAGE. If  Tag.SKIP_PAGE is returned, the JSP container will not process the remaining of the JSP  page. If Tag.EVAL_PAGE is returned, the JSP container processes the rest of the JSP  page as normal.   6.  The release method is the last method that the JSP container calls. This method has the   following signature:   public void release     You should write any clean-up code in this method implementation. For example, you  might want to close a file that was opened in the other method or destroy a database  connection.   7.  The JSP container returns the instance of the tag handler to a pool for future use.   A Content Substitution Tag Handler   The following example illustrates a tag handler that provides implementations for the  setPageContext and doStartTag methods. The setPageContext assigns the PageContext object  passed in by the JSP container to an object reference.   The doStartTag then obtains the JspWriter object through the getOut method of the PageContext  and writes something to it. Because the tag handler writes directly to the JspWriter object of the  current JSP page, whatever it writes is sent to the web browser. The tag handler is called  MyCustomTag and is shown in Listing 11.7.   Listing 11.7 The Content Substitution Tag Handler   package com.brainysoftware;     import javax.servlet.jsp.*;   import javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.*;     public class MyCustomTag implements Tag {    PageContext pageContext;       public void setParent Tag t  {    }       public void setPageContext PageContext p  {      pageContext = p;     }         275        public void release   {    }       public Tag getParent   {      return null;     }     public int doStartTag   {      try {        JspWriter out = pageContext.getOut  ;         out.println "Hello from the tag handler." ;       }       catch Exception e  {      }       return EVAL_BODY_INCLUDE;     }       public int doEndTag   throws JspException {      return EVAL_PAGE;     }   }   To test the tag handler, you need a JSP page as given in Listing 11.8 and a TLD file as given in  Listing 11.9.   Listing 11.8 The JSP Page that Contains a Custom Tag that Uses the Content  Substitution Tag Handler           Listing 11.9 The TLD File for This Example       <!DOCTYPE taglib     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.

It demonstrates the use of an attribute called number. The  tag handler has a setter called setNumber that is called by the JSP container to set the attribute  value. The code for the tag handler is given in Listing 11.10.   Listing 11.10 The DoublerTag   package com.brainysoftware;     import javax.servlet.jsp.*;   import javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.*;       276        public class DoublerTag implements Tag {    private int number;       public void setNumber int number  {      this.number = number;     }       PageContext pageContext;       public void setParent Tag t  {    }       public void setPageContext PageContext p  {      pageContext = p;     }       public void release   {    }       public Tag getParent   {      return null;     }       public int doStartTag   {      try {        JspWriter out = pageContext.getOut  ;         out.println "Double of " + number + " is " +  2 * number  ;       }       catch Exception e  {      }       return EVAL_BODY_INCLUDE;     }       public int doEndTag   throws JspException {      return EVAL_PAGE;     }   }   For the code to run, you need a JSP page, as shown in Listing 11.11, and a TLD file given in  Listing 11.12.

This method is invoked after the doStartTag  method and can return either the Tag.SKIP_BODY or IterationTag.EVAL_BODY_AGAIN. If the  latter is returned, the doAfterBody is called again. If the return value is Tag.SKIP_BODY, the  body will be skipped and the JSP container will call the doEndTag method.   An Example: A PowerTag   The following example demonstrates a tag handler that implements the IterationTag interface and  illustrates the use of the doAfterBody method.   The tag handler, called PowerTag, calculates a base number raised to the power of another number.  It then writes to the Web browser the following:   number^power=result   2^3=8   For instance, if you pass 2 for number and 3 for power, the tag handler returns the following  String to the browser:   The code of the tag handler is given in Listing 11.13.

You  don't even have access to it.   If you want to manipulate the body content of the custom tag, you have to use the BodyTag  interface and the BodyContent class in the javax.servlet.jsp.tagext package. This section  introduces you to these two elements and builds an example of a tag handler that manipulates the  body content.   The BodyTag Interface   The BodyTag interface extends the IterationTag interface by adding two methods, doInitBody and  setBodyContent, and two static final integers, EVAL_BODY_BUFFERED and  EVAL_BODY_TAG. As of JSP 1.2, however, EVAL_BODY_TAG is deprecated.   A tag handler that implements the BodyTag interface has a life cycle similar to the ones  implementing the IterationTag interface. The difference is that the doStartTag method of the tag  handler implementing BodyTag can return   SKIP_BODY, EVAL_BODY_INCLUDE, or EVAL_BODY_BUFFERED. If the method returns  EVAL_BODY_INCLUDE, the body is evaluated as it is in IterationTag. If the method returns  EVAL_BODY_BUFFERED, a BodyContent object is created that represents the custom tag's  body content. You learn more about the BodyContent class later in this section.   Two extra methods are called by the JSP container in tag handlers implementing the BodyTag  interface: setBodyContent and doInitBody. The two methods have the following signatures:   public void setBodyContent BodyContent bodyContent    public void doInitBody   throws javax.servlet.jsp.JspException   The setBodyContent method is called after the doStartTag, followed by the doInitBody method.  The setBodyContent will not be invoked, however, if one or both of the following is true:      The custom tag does not have a body content.     The custom tag has a body content but the doStartTag method returns SKIP_BODY or   EVAL_BODY_INCLUDE.      280      The doInitBody method can be used to prepare for evaluation of the body. Normally, this method  is called by the JSP container after the setBody Content method. This method will not be called,  however, if one of the following is true:      The custom tag does not have a body content.     The custom tag has a body content, but the doStartTag method returns SKIP_BODY or   EVAL_BODY_INCLUDE.   The BodyContent Class   The BodyContent class is an abstract class that extends the javax.servlet.jsp.JspWriter class. The  BodyContent class represents the body content of the custom tag, if any. You obtain the body  content from the setBodyContent method in the BodyTag interface.   An Example: Manipulating the Body Content   The following example shows a tag handler that manipulates the body content of a JSP custom tag.  The tag handler does two things: HTML encode the body content and print the encoded version of  the body content to the browser. The tag handler is called EncoderTag and incorporates the  htmlEncodeTag method from the com.brainysoftware.java.StringUtil class. The tag handler is  given in Listing 11.16.   Listing 11.16 The EncoderTag   package com.brainysoftware;     import javax.servlet.jsp.*;   import javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.*;     public class EncoderTag implements BodyTag {      PageContext pageContext;     BodyContent bodyContent;        **      * Encode an HTML tag so it will be displayed      * as it is on the browser.      * Particularly, this method searches the      * passed in String and replace every occurrence      * of the following characters:      * '<' with "<"      * '>' with ">"      * '&' with "&amp;"      *   '"' with "&quot;"      * ' ' with "&nbsp;"      *      private String encodeHtmlTag String tag  {      if  tag == null          return null;       int length = tag.length  ;       StringBuffer encodedTag = new StringBuffer 2 * length ;       for  int i=0; i<length; i++  {        char c = tag.charAt i ;         if  c == '<'            encodedTag.append "<" ;         else if  c == '>'            encodedTag.append ">" ;         else if  c == '&'        281              encodedTag.append "&amp;" ;         else if  c == '"'            encodedTag.append "&quot;" ;             when trying to output text as tag's value as in              values="???".         else if  c == ' '            encodedTag.append "&nbsp;" ;         else           encodedTag.append c ;         }       return encodedTag.toString  ;     }       public void setParent Tag t  {    }       public void setPageContext PageContext p  {      pageContext = p;     }       public void release   {    }       public Tag getParent   {      return null;     }       public int doStartTag   {      return EVAL_BODY_BUFFERED;     }       public void setBodyContent BodyContent bodyContent  {      this.bodyContent = bodyContent;     }       public void doInitBody   {      }       public int doAfterBody   {      String content = bodyContent.getString  ;       try{        JspWriter out = bodyContent.getEnclosingWriter  ;         out.print encodeHtmlTag content  ;       }       catch Exception e  {}         return SKIP_BODY;     }       public int doEndTag   throws JspException {      return EVAL_PAGE;     }   }   The important methods are the setBodyContent and the doAfterBody. The setBodyContent  method passes the BodyContent objects from the JSP container to the bodyContent object  reference that has class-scope, as shown here:      282      public void setBodyContent BodyContent bodyContent  {    this.bodyContent = bodyContent;   }   You cannot manipulate the body content in the setBodyContent method. You must wait until the  doInitBody is called. You write the following manipulation code in the doAfterBody method to  take care of this:   String content = bodyContent.getString  ;   try{    JspWriter out = bodyContent.getEnclosingWriter  ;     out.print encodeHtmlTag content  ;   }   catch Exception e  {}     return SKIP_BODY;   First, you obtain the String representation of the body content using the getString method of the  BodyContent class. Next, to write to the browser, you first need to use the getEnclosingWriter  method to obtain the implicit object out of the current JSP page. Finally, to output a String to the  browser, you call the print method of JspWriter.   To use the tag handler, you need the JSP page like the one given in Listing 11.17 and a TLD file,  as shown in Listing 11.18.   Listing 11.17 The JSP Page that Uses the EncoderTag Tag Handler          means change line    Listing 11.18 The TLD File for this Example       <!DOCTYPE taglib           PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.

This, of course, makes the code look more  complex than necessary, and the class takes longer to write and debug.   To solve this problem, the javax.servlet.jsp.tagext package provides support classes that  implement those interfaces. These classes are TagSupport and BodyTagSupport. Now, instead of  implementing an interface, you can extend one of these classes, as this section explains.      283      The TagSupport Class   The TagSupport class implements the IterationTag interface. Its signature is as follows:   public class TagSupport implements IterationTag, java.io.Serializable   The TagSupport class is intended to be used as the base class for tag handlers.   The BodyTagSupport Class   The BodyTagSupport class implements the BodyTag interface and has the following signature:   public class BodyTagSupport extends TagSupport implements BodyTag   This class is meant to be subclassed by tag handlers that need to implement the BodyTag interface.   To illustrate the usefulness of these support classes, the following example shows a tag handler  called CapitalizerTag that converts a body content to its uppercase version and outputs it to the  browser.The code is given in Listing 11.19.   Listing 11.19 The CapitalizerTag   package com.brainysoftware;     import javax.servlet.jsp.*;   import javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.*;     public class CapitalizerTag extends BodyTagSupport {      public int doAfterBody   {      String content = bodyContent.getString  ;       try{        JspWriter out = bodyContent.getEnclosingWriter  ;         out.print content.toUpperCase   ;       }       catch Exception e  {}       return SKIP_BODY;     }     }   See how simple the tag handler has become? You don't need to provide implementations of  methods you don't use.   To complete the example, here is the JSP page that uses the CapitalizerTag tag handler  in Listing  11.20  and the TLD file  Listing 11.21 .

A JSP custom tag is used to  invoke an associated tag handler, a Java class that handles the processing of the tag.   Tag handlers implement the Tag, IterationTag, or BodyTag interface, or they extend one of the  two support classes: TagSupport and BodyTagSupport.      285      Chapter 12. Programmable File Download   To Internet surfers, downloading files is a day-to-day activity that can be done without effort.  Writing a web program that allows only authorized users to download certain files is a totally  different story. Normally, the operating system or web container authentication system lets you  password protect files so that file download is allowed only if the user enters the correct user name  and password. However, at least two problems exist with this approach:       If you have more than one user, the password must be shared. However, a password is  supposed to be private and confidential. The more people who know the password, the  less secure it is. Furthermore, if many users know the password, it is not easy to record  who downloads a particular file. Also, in some cases, using the operating system or web  container authentication system is not as flexible as matching a user's credential against a  database table.      Depending on the type of downloaded file, the browser tries to open it with the correct  applicationâif the browser knows the file type. Sometimes, this is not what you want.  You need the browser to display the File Download dialog box, shown in Figure 12.1.   Figure 12.1. The File Download dialog box in Internet Explorer.      This chapter discusses a technique that allows you to programmatically send a file to a browser. I  call it programmable file download. Using this technique, you have full control over the  downloaded file. This chapter offers an example of how to perform programmable file downloads  from a JSP page.   Alternatively, you can use the file download bean  com.brainysoftware.web.FileDownload ,  which can be found in the software FileDownload directory on the accompanying CD. Just copy  the FileDownload.jar file onto the WEB-INF lib directory of your application directory and restart  Tomcat.

This means,   the file should be stored in a directory outside of the virtual directory. For example, if  your virtual directory is C:\Tomcat\webapps\MyVir, storing the file in this directory or in  a subdirectory under this one makes your file visible by anyone on the Internet.      Regardless of the type of file, the browser must display a File Download dialog box  like   the one shown in Figure 12.1 . It should not automatically fire up the application to run  the file if the browser recognizes the file extension.  For example, if the downloaded file  is a Microsoft Word document, the browser should not load Microsoft Word in the  browser.    Programmable file download has a number of applications, such as document management  applications, for securing a file, and so on. A few things that you need to do to create an  application for programmable file download are outlined in the following list:   1.  Set the response's content type to APPLICATION OCTET-STREAM. This value is not   case sensitive.   2.  Add an HTTP response header named Content-Disposition and give it the following value:   attachment; filename=theFileName   where theFileName is the default name for the file that appears in the File Download  dialog box. This is normally the same name as the file, but not necessarily.   3.  Do not send any characters other than the actual file content. This could happen without   you realizing it. For example, if you need to write some page directives in your file  download JSP page, you might write the directives in a normal way, such as the following:       <jsp:useBean id="DBBeanId" scope="page" class="docman.DBBean"   >   Without you realizing it, the carriage return at the end of the first page directive will be sent to the  browser. Instead, write those directives like the following:          This looks unusual, but it is safe.   Writing programmable file download code in JSP requires you to use the setContentType method  to set the response content type to APPLICATION OCTET-STREAM. It also requires that you  use the setHeader method to add the required header. Afterward, reading the file one character at a  time is easy using a java.io.FileInputStream class. The code in Listing 12.1 allows the user to  programmatically download the C:\access.log file in a Windows operating system. If you use a  different operating system, change the value of the filename and filepath variables accordingly.   Listing 12.1 Programmable File Download in JSP      287      <%        fetch the file     String filename = "access.log";     String filepath = "C:\\";     response.setContentType       "APPLICATION OCTET-STREAM" ;     response.setHeader "Content-Disposition",       "attachment; filename=\"" + filename + "\"" ;       java.io.FileInputStream fileInputStream =       new java.io.FileInputStream filepath + filename ;     int i;     while   i=fileInputStream.read    != -1  {      out.write i ;     }     fileInputStream.close  ;     out.close  ;   %>      Using the Brainysoftware.com File Download Bean   An easier way to programmatically download a file is by using the bean found in the  software FileDownload directory on the accompanying CD. The code in Listing 12.2 offers a user  authentication prior to sending a file to the browser. Only if the userName and password  parameters carry the values "james" and "cook" respectively, will the file be sent.   In the bean, the buffer is cleared prior to sending the file, therefore you can write directives as  usual.   Listing 12.2 Authenticating the User Before Sending a File   <jsp:useBean id="theBean" scope="page"     class="com.brainysoftware.web.FileDownload"  >   <%     String userName = request.getParameter "userName" ;     String password = request.getParameter "password" ;          only allow download if the user supplied the        correct user name and passwrd       if  userName != null && password  != null &&       userName.equals "james"  &&       password.equals "cook"   {      String filepath = "C:\\TV.bmp";       theBean.download response, filepath ;     }     else       out.print "Login incorrect" ;   %>      Summary      288                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       Programmable file download is an important function that can be useful in a number of  applications. This chapter showed you the things you need to do to send a file to the browser, and  how to force the browser to display the File Download dialog box. Knowing the key points  enables you to write a programmable file download application in any technology. For more  application of programmable file download, see Chapter 20, "Web-Based Document  Management."      289      Chapter 13. File Upload   File upload plays a significant roleâbeyond email applicationsâin java development. Uploading  files to the server is an important function that is offered in more and more types of applications,  including web-based document management systems and the likes of "Secure File Transfer via  HTTP."   This chapter discusses all you need to know about file upload. But first thing first. Before you  jump excitedly into coding, you need to understand the underlying theory: the HTTP request.  Understanding the HTTP request is critical because when you process an uploaded file, you work  with raw data not obtainable by simply querying the HTTP Request object.   The last section of the chapter talks about the File Upload bean from Brainysoftware.com,  included on the accompanying CD. Purchasing this book grants you the right to use it only for  learning purposes. To use it in deployment, commercial or non-commercial, you must obtain a  separate license. For more information on the license agreement, see the terms and conditions of  the software that can be found in the software fileUpload directory of the CD.   Let's now start by examining the HTTP request.       The HTTP Request   Each HTTP request from the web browser or other web client applications consists of three parts.  These are as follows:      The part containing the HTTP request method, the Uniform Resource Identifier  URI ,   and the protocol and the protocol version      HTTP request headers     The entity body   These three parts are explained in the following sections.   The request Method, URI, and Protocol   The first part of an HTTP request consists of the request method, the URI, and the protocol. The  HTTP request method indicates the method used in the HTTP request. In HTTP 1.0, the method  could be one of the following three methods: GET, HEAD, or POST. In HTTP 1.1, four more  methods are added to the initial three: DELETE, PUT, TRACE, and OPTIONS.   Among these seven methods, the two methods that you use most frequently are GET and POST.  GET is the default method. You use it, for example, when you type a URL, such as  http:  www.brainysoftware.com, in the Location or Address box of your browser to request a page.  The POST method is also common. You normally use this as the value of the   tag's  METHOD attribute. When you upload a file, you must use the POST method.   The second subpart of the HTTP request, the URI, specifies an Internet resource. A URI is  normally interpreted as relative to the web server's root directory. Thus, it starts with a forward  slash    , as follows:      290       virtualRoot pageName    eshop login.jsp   Note   For example, in a typical JavaServer pages application, the URI could be the following:   You can find more information on URI at http:  rfc.net rfc2396.html.   The third subpart of the first part is the protocol and the protocol version understood by the  requester  the browser . The protocol must be HTTP, and the version could be 1.0 or 1.1. Most  web servers nowadays understand both versions 1.0 and 1.1 of HTTP; therefore, this kind of web  server can serve HTTP requests in both versions as well. If you are still using an old HTTP 1.0  web server, you could be in trouble if your users use modern browsers that send requests using  HTTP 1.1 protocol.   Combining the three subparts, the first part of the HTTP request looks like the following:   POST  virtualRoot pageName HTTP version   For instance, the following is a typical first part of an HTTP request:   POST  eshop login.jsp HTTP 1.1   The HTTP Request Headers   The second component of an HTTP request consists of a number of HTTP headers. The four types  of HTTP headers are general, entity, request, and response. These headers are summarized in  Table 13.1, Table 13.2, and Table 13.3. The response headers are HTTP response-specific and as a  result are not relevant to this discussion.   Table 13.1. HTTP General Headers   Header  Pragma  The Pragma general header is used to include implementation-specific directives that may   Description   apply to any recipient along the request response chain. In other words, pragmas tell the  servers used to send this request to behave in a certain way. The Pragma header may  contain multiple values. For example, the following line of code tells all proxy servers  that relay this request not to use a cached version of the object, but instead to download  the object from the specified location:  Pragma: no-cache  The Date general header represents the date and time at which the message originated.   Table 13.2. HTTP Entity Headers   Description   The Allow header lists the set of methods supported by the resource identified by the  requested URL. This field informs the recipient of valid methods associated with the  resource. The Allow header is not permitted in a request using the POST method and  thus should be ignored if it is received as part of a POST entity. For instance, the  following Allow header specifies that GET and HEAD are allowed methods:  Allow: GET, HEAD  The Content-Encoding header is used to describe the type of encoding used on the  entity. When present, its value indicates the decoding mechanism that must be applied      Date     Header   Allow      Content- Encoding      291         Content- Length      Content- Type      Expires      Last- Modified         Header   From      Accept   to obtain the media type referenced by the Content-Type header. For example, the  following header specifies that x-gzip is the decoding mechanism that needs to be  applied to obtain the media type referenced by the Content-Type header:  Content-Encoding: x-gzip  The Content-Length header indicates the size  in decimal number of octets  of the  entity body sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the size of the  entity body that would have been sent had the request been a GET. Applications  should use this field to indicate the size of the entity body to be transferred, regardless  of the media type of the entity. A valid Content-Length field value is required on all  HTTP 1.0 request messages containing an entity body. Any Content-Length header  greater than or equal to 0 is a valid value. For example, the following header specifies  that the content length is 123,452 bytes:  Content-Length: 123452  The Content-Type header indicates the media type of the entity body sent to the  recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the media type that would have been  sent had the request been a GET. For example, the following header specifies that  text html is the media type of the HTTP response's entity body:  Content-Type: text html  The Expires header gives the date and time after which the entity should be considered  invalid. This allows information providers to suggest the volatility of the resource or a  date after which the information may no longer be accurate. Applications must not  cache this entity beyond the date given. The presence of an Expires header does not  imply that the original resource will change or cease to exist at, before, or after that  time. However, information providers should include an Expires header with that date.  For example, the following header specifies that the content should expire at 13:13:13  on August 6, 2002:  Expires: Tue, 6 Aug 2002 13:13:13 GMT  The Last-Modified header indicates the date and time at which the sender believes the  resource was last modified. The exact semantics of this field are defined in terms of  how the recipient should interpret it: If the recipient has a copy of this resource that is  older than the date given by the Last-Modified field, that copy should be considered  stale. For example, this header specifies that the resource was last updated at 12:12:12  on Aug 6, 2002:  Last-Modified: Tue, 6 Aug 2002 12:12:12 GMT   Table 13.3. HTTP Request Headers   Description   The From header specifies who is taking responsibility for the request. This field  contains the email address of the user submitting the request. For example, the  following header indicates that the user's email is rembrant@labsale.com:  From: rembrant@labsale.com  The Accept header contains a semicolon-separated list of MIME representation  schemes that are accepted by the client. The server uses this information to  determine which data types are safe to send to the client in the HTTP response.  Although the Accept field can contain multiple values, the Accept line itself also  can be used more than once to specify additional accept types.  This has the same  effect as specifying multiple accept types on a single line.  If the Accept field is not  used in the request header, the default accept types of text plain and text html are  assumed. For example, the following header specifies a few MIME schemes  accepted by the client:   Accept: text plain;      292                  text htmlAccept; image gif;  image jpeg  The Accept-Encoding header is similar in syntax to the Accept header; however, it  specifies the content-encoding schemes that are acceptable in the response. For  instance, the following header indicates that x-compress and x-zip are the content- encoding schemes that the response can accept:  Accept-Encoding: x-compress; x-zip  The Accept-Language header also is similar to the Accept header. This header  specifies the preferred response language. The following example specifies English  as the accepted language:  Accept-Language: en      User-Agent  The User-Agent header, if present, specifies the name of the client browser. The   Accept- Encoding      Accept- Language   first word should be the name of the software, followed by a slash and an optional  version number. Any other product names that are part of the complete software  package also may be included. Each name version pair should be separated by a  space. This field is used mostly for statistical purposes and allows servers to track  software usage and protocol violation. For example, the following header specifies  that the client is using Internet Explorer 4.01 on Windows 98 operating system:  User-Agent: Mozilla 4.0   compatible; MSIE 4.01; Windows 98   The Referer header specifies the URI that contained the URI in the request header.  In HTML, this would be the address of the page that contained the link to the  requested object. Like the User-Agent header, this header is not required but is  mostly for the server's statistical and tracking purpose. For example, the following  header specifies that the current request is sent as the result of the user clicking the  link http:  localhost:8080 MyApp Page1.jsp.   Referer   Referer: http:  localhost:8080 MyApp Page1.jsp   Authorization  The Authorization header contains authorization information. The first word   contained in this header specifies the type of authorization system to be used. Then,  separated by a space, it should be followed by authorization information such as a  user name, password, and so forth. For example, here is a typical Authorization  header:  Authorization: user  ken:dragonlancer  The If-Modified-Since header is used with the GET method to make it conditional.  Basically, if the object hasn't changed since the date and time specified by this  header, the object is not sent. A local cached copy of the object is used instead. For  example, the following is such a header:  If-Modified-Since: Thu, 6 Aug 2002  11:12:29 GMT   If-Modified- Since   The Entity Body   HTTP Request Example   The entity body is the content of the HTTP request itself. The following section illustrates this in  the best wayâwith an example.      293      The following is an example of an HTTP header:   Accept: application vnd.ms-excel, application msword, * *   Accept-Language: en-au   Connection: Keep-Alive   Host: localhost   Referer: http:  localhost examples jsp num demo.jsp   User-Agent: Mozilla 4.0  compatible; MSIE 4.01; Windows 98    Content-Length: 32   Content-Type: application x-www-form-urlencoded   Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate     LastName=truman&FirstName=daniel   The preceding HTTP header reveals a lot. The first line tells you that the browser sending this  request can accept a number of file formats, including Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word. This  information is followed by the language used  in this case, Australian English , the type of  connection  keep-alive , and the name of the host  localhost . The header also tells the server that  the request is sent from the demo.jsp, which is located in  http:  localhost examples jsp num  directory. Then in the User-Agent entry, the  request shows that the user is using Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4.01, which is compatible  with Netscape Navigator 4.0. The user's operating system is also recorded as Windows 98. The  meaning of the information can be retrieved from Table 13.1, Table 13.2, and Table 13.3.   Following the header are two pairs of carriage-return line-feed characters. The length of this  separator is 4 bytes because each carriage-return line-feed character pair consists of the ASCII  character numbers 13 and 10. From the previous HTTP header, you can see that the body consists  of the following code:   LastName=truman&FirstName=daniel   The HTTP header clearly comes from a form with two input elements: one called LastName with  the value truman and the other called FirstName with the value daniel.   Note that the length of LastName=truman&FirstName=daniel is 32, as indicated by the Content- Length header.   Now that you have finished dissecting an HTTP request, you are ready to take this information to  the coding stage. To program a complete file-upload application, you need to know both the server  side and the client side. The next section takes a look at the client side.     Client-Side HTML   Prior to the RFC 1867 standard, eight values were possible for the TYPE attribute of an INPUT  element: CHECKBOX, HIDDEN, IMAGE, PASS-WORD, RADIO, RESET, SUBMIT, and  TEXT. Although these form elements have proven useful in a wide variety of applications in  which input from the user needs to be transferred to the server, none of these is useful for sending  either a text or binary file. For this reason, the TYPE attribute of an Input element was given  another possible value: FILE. In addition, the RFC defines a new MIME media type,  multipart form-data, and specifies the behavior of HTML user agents when interpreting a form  with ENC-TYPE="multipart form-data" and or   tags.   For example, an HTML form author who wants to request one or more files from a user would  write this:      294          File to Upload:                 When an INPUT tag of type FILE is encountered, the browser might show a display of previously  selected filenames and a Browse button or selection method. Clicking the Browse button would  cause the browser to enter into a file-selection mode appropriate for the platform. Window-based  browsers might display a file-selection window, for example. In such a file-selection dialog box,  the user would have the option of replacing a current selection, adding a new file selection, and so  on.       HTTP Request of an Uploaded File   Before you process a file upload, you should first familiarize yourself with the HTTP request of an  uploaded file. The following small application is not for processing an uploaded file; however, it  demonstrates how to prepare an HTML page to upload a file and write the HTTP request into a  file for further study. Viewing the produced file with a text editor reveals the format of the request,  which in turn enables you to extract the filename, the file content, and other useful information.  This small application consists of an HTML file called main.html, a JSP file called Jsp1.jsp, and a  JavaBean called SimpleBean.   The main.html file is the one that the client can use to select a file to upload to the server. Listing  13.1 presents the code for it.   Listing 13.1 The main.html File            File Upload                Author:         Company:         Select file to upload                         You can see that the ENCTYPE attribute is used in the   tag and its value is  MULTIPART FORM-DATA. There are four input elements, including the Submit button. The  first two are normal TEXT elements called Author and Company. The third one is an element of  type FILE, the input element that is used to select a file.   The ACTION attribute of the form has the value of Jsp1.jsp, meaning that the request  and also  the file uploaded  is sent to the Jsp1.jsp file.      295      The Jsp1.jsp file simply calls a bean called SimpleBean, as presented in Listing 13.2.   Listing 13.2 The Jsp1.jsp File       <%     TheBean.doUpload request ;   %>   Listing 13.3 presents the code for the SimpleBean bean.   Listing 13.3 The SimpleBean Bean   import java.io.*;   import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;   import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;   import javax.servlet.ServletInputStream;     public class FileUploadBean {      public void doUpload HttpServletRequest request  throws       IOException {      PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter         new BufferedWriter new FileWriter "Demo.out"   ;       ServletInputStream in = request.getInputStream  ;         int i = in.read  ;       while  i != -1  {        pw.print  char  i ;         i = in.read  ;       }       pw.close  ;     }   }   The user interface is given by the main.html file and is shown in Figure 13.1. For this example, I  enter some input values for the Author and Company input elements and select a file called  abisco.html with the following content. I select an HTML file to upload because I would like to  show the content of the file. Because an HTML file is basically a text file, the content is easy to  display.   Figure 13.1. The example's user interface.      296         The content of the abisco.html file is as follows:            Abisco            After the form in the main.html file is submitted to the Jsp1.jsp page, the Jsp1.jsp page calls the  SimpleBean bean to write everything on the HttpServletRequest object to a file named Demo.out.   When you open the Demo.out file, you will see something similar to the following:   âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ7d15340138   Content-Disposition: form-data; name="Author"     A. Christie   âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ7d15340138   Content-Disposition: form-data; name="Company"     Abisco   âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ7d15340138   Content-Disposition: form-data; name="Filename";   filename="C:\123data\abisco.html"   Content-Type: text html            Abisco            âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ7d15340138ââ   In brief, the entity body of the HTTP request contains all the form input, including the uploaded  file. Those input values are separated from each other by a delimiter. Sometimes called a      297      boundary, this delimiter consists of a few dozen dash characters followed by a random number. In  the previous example, the delimiter is the following line:   âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ7d15340138   And the same delimiter acts as a separator between two form elements' values. The last delimiter  ends the entity body with two more dashes:   âââââââââââââââââââââââââââââ7d15340138ââ   For an input value that comes from a nonfile element, the delimiter is followed by the following  line:   Content-Disposition: form-data; name=inputName   In the previous line, inputName is the name of the form element. For example:   Content-Disposition: form-data; name="Author"   The line is followed by two sequences of carriage-return line-feed characters and the element  value.   For a file, the delimiter is followed by two lines. The first contains the name of the FILE input  element and the complete path of the file in the user's computer. From the previous HTTP request,  this line is as follows:   Content-Disposition: form-data; name="Filename";   filename="C:\123data\abisco.html"   This line states that the FILE input element is called Filename and the file path is  C:\123data\abisco.html.   The second line contains the content type of the file. Its value depends on the file being uploaded.  For this example, the value is text html:   Content-Type: text html   Like the non-File input element, the content starts after two sequences of carriage-return line-feed  characters.   The value of the file separator will differ according to the client's operating system. The  preceding code illustrates the output from a Windows machine. Linux Unix will have a  forward slash     as a file separator and Macintosh a colon  : .   Warnning       Uploading a File   Based on the explanation in the previous sections, you can now write a JSP page to handle file  upload. This JSP page is given in Listing 13.4.      298                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       Listing 13.4 File Upload JSP Page       <%        the directory where the uploaded file will be saved.     String savePath = "C:\\123data\\";       String filename = "";       ServletInputStream in = request.getInputStream  ;       byte[] line = new byte[128];     int i = in.readLine line, 0, 128 ;     int boundaryLength = i - 2;     String boundary = new String line, 0, boundaryLength ;   -2  discards the newline character       while  i != -1  {      String newLine = new String line, 0, i ;       if  newLine.startsWith "Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\""    {        String s = new String line, 0, i-2 ;         int pos = s.indexOf "filename=\"" ;         if  pos != -1  {          String filepath = s.substring pos+10, s.length  -1 ;              Windows browsers include the full path on the client              But Linux Unix and Mac browsers only send the filename              test if this is from a Windows browser           pos = filepath.lastIndexOf "\\" ;           if  pos != -1              filename = filepath.substring pos + 1 ;           else             filename = filepath;         }             this is the file content         i = in.readLine line, 0, 128 ;         i = in.readLine line, 0, 128 ;            blank line           i = in.readLine line, 0, 128 ;           ByteArrayOutputStream buffer = new ByteArrayOutputStream  ;         newLine = new String line, 0, i ;           while  i != -1 && !newLine.startsWith boundary   {             the problem is the last line of the file content              contains the new line character.              So, we need to check if the current line is              the last line.           buffer.write line, 0, i ;           i = in.readLine line, 0, 128 ;           newLine = new String line, 0, i ;         }         try {             save the uploaded file           RandomAccessFile f = new RandomAccessFile             savePath + filename, "rw" ;           byte[] bytes = buffer.toByteArray  ;           f.write bytes, 0, bytes.length - 2 ;           f.close  ;         }       299            catch  Exception e  {}       }         i = in.readLine line, 0, 128 ;       }    end while   %>   The code in Listing 13.4 begins by obtaining a reference to the ServletInputStream object from the  HTTP request. The ServletInputStream contains the content of the uploaded file as you see here:   ServletInputStream in = request.getInputStream  ;   The beginning of the uploaded file is separated by the boundary and a sequence of carriage-return  line-feed characters. Therefore, you can read the content of the HttpServletRequest object line by  line. The following line of code defines a byte array called line:   byte[] line = new byte[128];   You then use the readLine method of ServletInputStream to read the first line of the  HttpServletRequest object's content:   int i = in.readLine line, 0, 128 ;   The first line gives the boundary and its length. The boundary and the length of the boundary are  important values, as you will see later. The boundary is terminated by a sequence of carriage- return line-feed characters; therefore, the actual length is 2 less than the number of bytes returned  by the readLine method:   int boundaryLength = i - 2;   The boundary is retrieved from the byte array line by discarding the last two carriage-return line- feed characters, as follows:   String boundary = new String line, 0, boundaryLength ;   Having retrieved the boundary, you then can start extracting the form element value by reading the  HttpServletRequest object's content line by line using the while loop, until it reaches the end when  the readLine method returns -1. The following code gives an example of this:   while  i != -1  {    String newLine = new String line, 0, i ;     .     .     .   }   With browsers on Windows operating systems, the uploaded filename is sent along with the file  path. In other operating systems, no file path information is sent.   Now, you can obtain the filename from the read string by using the following code:   String s = new String line, 0, i-2 ;   int pos = s.indexOf "filename=\"" ;   if  pos != -1  {    String filepath = s.substring pos+10, s.length  -1 ;       300           Windows browsers include the full path on the client        But Linux Unix and Mac browsers only send the filename        test if this is from a Windows browser     pos = filepath.lastIndexOf "\\" ;     if  pos != -1        filename = filepath.substring pos + 1 ;     else       filename = filepath;   }   After you obtain the filename, you will notice two pairs of carriage-return linefeed characters  before the beginning of the uploaded file content. Therefore, you call the readLine method twice:   i = in.readLine line, 0, 128 ;   i = in.readLine line, 0, 128 ;   Then begins the actual file content. The content of the file is buffered into a  ByteArrayOutputStream; thus you instantiate one with the following:   ByteArrayOutputStream buffer = new ByteArrayOutputStream  ;   Then, you keep reading the line until you find another boundary, as shown here:   newLine = new String line, 0, i ;     while  i != -1 && !newLine.startsWith boundary   {       the problem is the last line of the file content        contains the new line character.        So, we need to check if the current line is        the last line.     buffer.write line, 0, i ;     i = in.readLine line, 0, 128 ;     newLine = new String line, 0, i ;   }   The boundary signals the end of the uploaded file. The last step is to save the buffer into a file, as  shown in the following code:   try {       save the uploaded file     RandomAccessFile f = new RandomAccessFile       savePath + filename, "rw" ;     byte[] bytes = buffer.toByteArray  ;     f.write bytes, 0, bytes.length - 2 ;     f.close  ;   }   catch  Exception e  {}   To use the FileUpload.jsp file in Listing 13.4, you need another page where the upload form is  displayed. An example is given in Listing 13.5.   Listing 13.5 The Form to Select a File to Be Uploaded            File Upload                301      <FORM ACTION=http:  localhost:8080 myApp servlet FileUpload.jsp  ENCTYPE="MULTIPART   FORM-DATA" METHOD=POST>   Select file to upload                            FileUpload Bean   The code in Listing 13.4 allows you to upload a file and save it in the specified directory on the  server. Oftentimes, however, you also want to send other pieces of information along with the file.  The File Upload bean, on the accompanying CD, lets you upload a file and an unlimited number  of field values. This component takes the form of a class called  com.brainysoftware.web.FileUpload and can be found in the software FileUpload  directory of the  CD.   The following is the list of methods in the FileUploadBean class:   public String getFilepath     This method returns the file path where the uploaded file is saved.   public String getFilename     Returns the name of the uploaded file.   public String getContentType     Returns the value of the content type of the uploaded file.   public String getFieldValue String fieldName    Returns the value of the HTML form element whose name is specified by fieldName.   public void setSavePath String savePath    Specifies the name of the directory where the uploaded file should be saved on the server.   public void doUpload HttpServletRequest request  throws IOException   The most important method in the FileUploadBean class, this method extracts the field names and  values from the HTML form and processes and saves the uploaded file.   Using the File Upload Bean   To use the file, copy the BrainySoftwareFileUpload.jar file in the software FileUpload directory  on the accompanying CD to the WEB-INF lib directory under your application directory and  restart Tomcat.      302      The following listings provide an HTML file and a JSP file that illustrate the use of the bean. The  HTML file contains a form with a few elements. The HTML file is given in Listing 13.6, and the  JSP file is given in Listing 13.7.   Listing 13.6 The HTML File to Upload a File            File Upload                Author:         Company:         Comment:          Select file to upload         Description:                         When the user submits the form, the HTTP request will be handed to Jsp1.jsp, which uses the  FileUpload bean to process the request. The Jsp1.jsp is given in Listing 13.7.   Listing 13.7 The Jsp1.jsp File   <jsp:useBean id="theBean" scope="page"  class="com.brainysoftware.web.FileUploadBean"  >   <%       in Windows     theBean.setSavePath "C:\\123data\\" ;         in Linux Unix, you might have something like       theBean.setSavePath " home budi " ;       theBean.doUpload request ;     theBean.save  ;     out.println "Filename:" + theBean.getFilename   ;     out.println " Content Type:" + theBean.getContentType   ;     out.println " Author:" + theBean.getFieldValue "Author"  ;     out.println " Company:" + theBean.getFieldValue "Company"  ;     out.println " Comment:" + theBean.getFieldValue "Comment"  ;   %>      Multiple File Upload   Multiple file upload is possible using the Pro version of the Brainysoftware.com File Upload bean   http:  www.brainysoftware.com       303        Summary   File upload is an important function that is used in many different applications. Such applications  include the web-based email  for uploading attachments , document management, and FTP by  HTTP.   In this chapter, you learned how to upload a file by first presenting the HTTP request header. You  also learned how to process an uploaded file on the server and use the Upload bean from  BrainySoftware.com.      304      Chapter 14. Security Configuration   In the previous chapters, you learned how to implement a Login page using both servlets and JSP  to restrict access to a certain resource.The common practice is to write code that takes a user's  name and password and matches them against those stored in a database.   Although this practice is great, there is another approach to securing your application that does not  require you to write a single line of code. Instead, you configure the deployment descriptor of the  web application you want to secure.   This chapter discusses the security configuration in the deployment descriptor and introduces you  to various methods of authentications. This chapter also shows you how to use the security- constraint and login-config elements to configure security for your applications.       Imposing Security Constraints   By configuring the deployment descriptor, you can restrict access to some resources in an  application in many different ways. For example, you can require the user to log in to view one  resource, but not another resource. You also can restrict access to a resource if the request is sent  using a particular HTTP method. For instance, you can mandate that a resource is viewable as  long as the user requests it using the POST method.   Normally, if access to a resource is restricted, you will require the user to log inâthat is, enter a  user name and password. If the user provides the correct user name and password, access to the  page is given. Of course, you can restrict a resource without even allowing the user to enter  credentials. If you intend to make a resource unreachable, however, why put it there in the first  place?   You can display a Login page automatically. In this case, the browser will display its own Login  dialog box. Alternatively, you can use your own Login dialog box if you want.   When imposing security constraints, you need to choose what resources to protect by drafting a  URL pattern. If the HTTP request's URL matches that pattern, access to the resource is restricted;  that is, the user will be required to log in. For instance, if the URL pattern you give is   servlet FirstServlet, the web container will restrict any request whose URL contains that pattern,  such as http:  domain myApp servlet FirstServlet. You can use the wild card * in a  URL pattern to represent any set of characters. For instance, the URL pattern  servlet * will  restrict access to any URL that contains " servlet ", such as  http:  domain myApp servlet Testing or  http:  domain myApp servlet Filter.   After you determine what resource s  to protect, you also need to consider who can have access to  that resource. Programmatically, as in the examples in previous chapters, you can hard-code a set  of user names and passwords or match a user name and password against a table in a database.  With the deployment descriptor, however, the concept is slightly different. In addition to user  names and passwords, you need to be familiar with principals and roles. These items are explained  in the next section.   Principals and Roles      305      The concept of the principal is simple. You can think of principals as users. Basically, a principal  is an entity. It could be an individual, a corporate, or another type of entity. "Principal" and "user"  are used interchangeably to refer to an identity.   A role is an abstract grouping of users. It refers more to a position rather than an individual. You  can think of a role as a group. As such, a user can fill one or more roles.   How do you specify the list of users and roles? Tomcat includes a file called tomcat-users.xml in  the conf directory under %CATALINA_HOME%. By default, it declares three users, as follows:                             The file says the following about the users:      The first user is called "tomcat". It can fill the "tomcat" role.     The second user has the name of "role1" and can fill the "role1" role.     The third one is "both" and can play both "tomcat" and "role1" roles.   This is probably not a good example to explain users and roles, so let's use the following example:                     <user name="MrDirector" password="humblepine"       roles="marketingManager,HRManager"  >       This example also works with three users; their user names are Joe, Peter, and MrDirector. Joe is  the Marketing Manager in the organization; therefore, he can fill the marketingManager role. Peter  is the HR Manager and he fills the HRManager role. MrDirector is the Director of the company.  He is the highest in the organization rank. He can play both marketingManager and HRManager  roles.   Each restricted resource is associated with a role that can have access to it. A servlet that displays  the salary list, for example, is likely to be associated with the HRManager role. In this case, Peter  can use his user name and password to access it. Joe has a valid user name and password as well.  Joe is not in the position to access the salary list, however. If he ever tries to log in and access the  servlet by using his user name and password, he will be refused access.   On the other hand, MrDirector can play both roles. If one day Peter is not in because he is ill  or  having another job interview , MrDirector can use his user name and password to access the  servlet that displays the salary list.   You can add as many users as you want to the tomcat-users.xml file.   Using the Security-Constraint Element   As previously mentioned, you can restrict access to a resource without entering a single line of  code by configuring the deployment descriptor. You can use several elements to assist in doing  this. The elements most frequently used are security-constraint and login-config.      306      Note   You use the security-constraint element to restrict access to one or more resources. The security- constraint element can appear multiple times in a deployment descriptor.   You can find out more about the elements that can be used in the deployment descriptor  in Chapter 16, "Application Deployment."   The security-constraint element can contain the following elements:      display-name. An optional element that contains a descriptive name to be displayed by   an XML manipulation tool.      web-resource-collection. This element identifies a subset of resources to which access  needs to be restricted. In the web-resource-collection, you can define the URL pattern s   and the HTTP method. If no HTTP method is present, the security constraint applies to all  methods.  auth-constraint. This element specifies the user roles that should have access to this  resource collection. If no auth-constraint element is specified, the security constraint  applies to all roles.      user-data-constraint. This element is used to indicate how the data that is sent to the       client and web container  and vice versa  must be protected.   The web-resource-collection element can have the following required and optional subelements:      web-resource-name. A name identifying a resource. This is a required element.     description. An optional element containing a description of the resource collection.     url-pattern. An optional element specifying a URL pattern to which the restriction must  be applied. There could be zero or more url-pattern elements in a web-resource-collection  element.      http-method. An optional element specifying the restricted method. There could be zero   or more http-method elements in a web-resource-collection element.   The auth-constraint element can have the following subelements:      description. An optional element describing the auth-constraint element.      role-name. The roles that have access to the restricted resource. This element is required.   The user-data-constraint element can contain the following elements:      description. An optional element describing the user-data-constraint element.      transport-guarantee. This element must have one of the following values: NONE,  INTEGRAL, or CONFIDENTIAL. NONE means that the application does not require  any transport guarantees. INTEGRAL means that the data between the server and the  client should be sent in such a way that it can't be changed in transit. CONFIDENTIAL  means that the data transmitted must be encrypted. In most cases, SSL is used for either  INTEGRAL or CONFIDENTIAL. This element is required.   Let's start with an example of a deployment descriptor, given in Listing 14.1.   Listing 14.1 The Deployment Descriptor         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"       307        "http:  java.sun.com j2ee dtds web-app_2_3.dtd">                                             Restricted Area                     servlet *                           manager                          Having a deployment descriptor, such as the one in Listing 14.1, causes the web container to block  any request that matches the URL pattern that does not come from a user in the manager role. The  auth-constraint element inside the security-constraint element says that the resource can be  accessed only by users in the manager role. Figure 14.1 shows the result when a non-manager tries  to access the resource.   Figure 14.1. Unauthorized user trying to access a restricted area.   Using the login-config Element   The preceding section discussed the security-constraint element. Now, let's have a look at the  second element for security configurationâlogin-config.         308                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       Firstly, let's add another user to the tomcat-users.xml file. This user has a user name of "GM", a  password of "lontong", and a role of "manager". The tomcat-users.xml file is given in Listing 14.2.   Listing 14.2 Adding a New User to the tomcat-users.xml File                                   How does a user access a resource using a specified role? Each user needs to log in using the user  name and password assigned to the role.   How do you allow them to log in? By using the login-config element.   Note   When you ask a user to enter credentials  user name and password , you are  authenticating the user. See the sidebar later in this section for more about authentication  methods.   The login-config element can contain the following optional elements:               auth-method. This element contains the authentication methods and can have one of the  following values: BASIC, DIGEST, FORM, or CLIENT-CERT. The following sidebar,  "Authentication Methods," explains more about these methods.  realm-name. This is the descriptive name that will be displayed in the standard Login  dialog box if BASIC is specified as the value of the auth-method element.  form-login-config. This element specifies the Login and error pages that will be used if  the value of the auth-method element is FORM. This is explained in more detail in the  following section.   Authentication Methods   When you are securing a Java-based web application, you can choose from the  following four authentication methods:      Basic authentication     Form-based authentication     Digest authentication     Secure Socket Layer  SSL  and client certificate authentication   Using the Basic authentication, when a user tries to access a restricted resource, the web  container asks the browser to display a standard Login dialog box containing two boxes:  one for entering a user name, and one for the password. If the user enters the correct user  name and password, the server displays the requested resource. Otherwise, the Login  dialog box is redisplayed, asking the user to try again. The server will let the user try to  log in three times, after which an error message is sent. The drawback of this method is  that the user name and password are transmitted to the server using the base64 encoding,  which is a very weak encryption scheme.   Form-based authentication is similar to Basic authentication; however, instead of  sending an instruction to the browser to display a standard Login page, the server uses a      309      custom Login page that must be prepared by the developer. This authentication method  will also display a custom Error page written by the developer on a failed attempt to  login.   The authentication methods take care only of displaying the login form. Without SSL,  the password is sent as plain text and is insecure. With SSL, the password is sent  encrypted.   Even though both basic authentication and form-based authentication send the login  information in almost plain text, you can use SSL to encrypt the data.   Digest authentication works like Basic authentication; however, the login information is  not transmitted. Instead, the hash of the passwords are sent. This protects the  information from malicious sniffers.   Basic and digest authentication methods are specified in RFC2617, which you can find  at ftp:  ftp.isi.edu in-notes rfc2617.txt.   When the transmitted data is sensitive, you need to use SSL to encrypt it. For more  information about SSL, see http:  home.netscape.com eng ssl3 3-SPEC.HTM.   As an example of requiring the user to log in, consider the deployment descriptor in Listing 14.3.   Listing 14.3 Deployment Descriptor that Requires the User to Log In         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com j2ee dtds web-app_2_3.dtd">                                         Restricted Area                     servlet *                           manager                               BASIC         User Basic Authentication              See how you use the login-config element? The authentication method used is BASIC. Now every  time a user accesses a resource using a URL matching the pattern, the web browser will display a  dialog box as shown in Figure 14.2.   Figure 14.2. The Login dialog box.      310         The user can then type the user name and password for the manager role. The user name must be  "GM" and the password is "lontong".   If the user does not login successfully, the dialog box reappears. If the user fails to login three  times, the browser will display Figure 14.3:   Figure 14.3. HTTP Status 401.   If the login is successful, the resource is displayed and an authentication token is sent in the  response. After the user logs in successfully, requests for another resource matching the pattern  will not require login because the user already has the authentication token.         311      If the user logs in correctly using the user name and password of another role, the browser will  display a different page, as you see in Figure 14.4. For example, the user might type "tomcat" as  the user name and "tomcat" as the password  using the role tomcat in the tomcat-users.xml file .   Figure 14.4. Using the wrong role.          Allowing Multiple Roles   You can specify more than one role to have access to a resource. For example, Listing 14.4 gives  the deployment descriptor that allows two roles to access a certain resource.   Listing 14.4 Allowing Multiple Roles to Access a Resource         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com j2ee dtds web-app_2_3.dtd">                                       Restricted Area                     servlet *                           manager           tomcat        312                                 BASIC         User Basic Authentication              You also need the tomcat-users.xml file in Listing 14.5.   Listing 14.5 The tomcat-users.xml File for the Example                                   Now you can use both the manager role and the tomcat role to access the single resource. Note  that the tomcat role appears both in the second and fourth user elements. This means that you also  can use the user name "both" and password "tomcat" to access the resource.       Form-Based Authentication   The auth-method element in the login-config element allows you to specify FORM as its value.  Assigning FORM as the value of auth-method means that you don't want to use the browser's  standard Login page. Instead, you are telling the web container that you want to use your own  custom page. This is called form-based authentication.   You need to prepare two pages if you decide to use form-based authentication: a Login page and  an Error page. The Login page, which can be a static file or a dynamic resource, is a page that is  displayed when a user tries to access a restricted resource. Basically, the Login page can be as  simple or as complex as you like. The requirements are that the Login page needs to contain an  HTML form with the following requisites:      The method of the form must be POST.     The value of the ACTION attribute must be "j_security_check".     The form must have two input elements called j_username and j_password. Into these   elements the user enters the user name and password.   In addition, you need an Error page that can also be a static page or a dynamic resource. This page  is displayed when the user does not log in successfully. Note that the web container will display  the Error page on the first failed attempt to login.   The following is an example of form-based authentication. The deployment descriptor is given in  Listing 14.6.   Listing 14.6 The Deployment Descriptor for Form-Based Authentication           313        <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com j2ee dtds web-app_2_3.dtd">                                         Restricted Area                     servlet *                           manager           tomcat                               FORM                    Login.html            Error.html                      The form-login-config element specifies the URL of the Login page and the Error page. The  deployment descriptor mandates that the Login page is called Login.html and is to be found under  the application directory. The descriptor also tells the web container that the Error page for this  form-based authentication is named Error.html and is also found under the application directory.   Listings 14.7 and 14.8 list the Login page and the Error page, respectively.   Listing 14.7 Login.html            Login Page                 Please enter your user name and password                   User name:                       Password:                                                    314              Listing 14.8 Error.html            Error Page              Login failed. Click  here  to try again.           When a user tries to access the resource whose URL matches the pattern specified in the  deployment descriptor, the browser displays the Login page shown in Figure 14.5.   Figure 14.5. Login page.   If the login fails, the Error page is displayed, as shown in Figure 14.6.   Figure 14.6. Error page.         315         A successful login will display the requested page.     Digest Authentication   Using digest authentication does not require you to change too much in the deployment descriptor.  The main difference between Basic and form-based authentication and digest authentication is that  you don't specify a realm if the authentication method used is DIGEST.   The following example demonstrates the use of digest authentication. The deployment descriptor  is given in Listing 14.9.   Listing 14.9 The Deployment Descriptor that Uses the Digest Authentication  Method         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com j2ee dtds web-app_2_3.dtd">                                         Restricted Area                     servlet *                           manager        316             tomcat                               DIGEST              When the user tries to access the restricted resource, a dialog box, such as the one shown in Figure  14.7, is displayed.   Figure 14.7. Digest Authentication Method dialog box.   Note that this dialog box is very similar to the one used in the Basic authentication method.          Methods Related to Security   Even though configuring the deployment descriptor and specifying roles in the tomcat-users.xml  file means that you don't need to do any programming in your code, sometimes some coding is  inevitable. For example, you might want to record all users that log in. The  javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest interface provides a few methods that enable you to have  access to portions of the user's login information. These methods are getAuthType, isUserInRole,  getPrincipal, and getRemoteUser. The methods are explained here:   public String getAuthType     This method returns the name of the authentication scheme used to protect the servlet. The return  value is one of the following values: BASIC_AUTH, FORM_AUTH, CLIENT_CERT_AUTH,  and DIGEST_AUTH. It returns null if the request was not authenticated.   public boolean isUserInRole String role    This method indicates whether the authenticated user is included in the specified logical "role". If  the user has not been authenticated, the method returns false.      317      public java.security.Principal getUserPrincipal     This method returns a java.security.Principal object containing the name of the current  authenticated user. If the user has not been authenticated, the method returns null.   public String getRemoteUser     Returns the login of the user making this request, if the user has been authenticated, or null if the  user has not been authenticated. Whether the user name is sent with each subsequent request  depends on the browser and type of authentication.   For example, the JSP code in Listing 14.10 demonstrates the use of the different methods.   Listing 14.10 Using HttpServletRequest Methods to Obtain the User Name Login  Information   <%     out.println "Auth Type:" + request.getAuthType   ;     out.println " User Principal:" + request.getUserPrincipal   ;     out.println " Remote User:" + request.getRemoteUser   ;     if  request.isUserInRole "tomcat"         out.println " User in role" ;     else       out.println " User not in role" ;   %>   If you run this code, you should see something similar to Figure 14.8.   Figure 14.8. Finding out who the user is.           318                                                                                                                Team-FlyÂ®       Restricting Certain Methods   The previous examples restrict access to a resource regardless of the HTTP method used to  request the resource. You also can selectively choose HTTP methods that you need to restrict. For  example, you may want to restrict access to a request that is submitted using the GET method, but  yet allows access if the user is using the POST method.   The deployment descriptor in Listing 14.11 restricts the GET method. If the page is requested  using the GET method, the user needs to log in. If the page is requested using the other methods,  such as POST, no authentication is required.   Listing 14.11 Restricting a Certain Method         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com j2ee dtds web-app_2_3.dtd">                                         Restricted Area                     *           GET                           manager           tomcat                               DIGEST                 Summary   In this chapter, you have learned how to configure your deployment descriptor so that the web  container restricts access to some or all of the resources. The configuration means that you need  only to modify your deployment descriptor fileâno programming is necessary.   If you need to access the user login's information, you can use the following methods of the  javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest interface: getRemoteUser, getPrincipal, getAuthType, and  isUserInRole.      319      Chapter 15. Caching   You normally store data in a relational database. Connecting to the database, however, is one of  the most resource-consumptive operations that you commonly perform in a web application.  Therefore, if you can reduce the number of times your application needs to access the database,  your application will generally be faster and more scalable. Many people avoid databases entirely  by storing their data in text files or XML files, but this solution is not suitable for every  application. In addition, if you have an existing database-based application, using XML will  require a change to your data structure and eventually to your application architecture.   This chapter presents two solutions to the database-access problem: caching data in a text file and  caching data in memory.   The first solution writes frequently accessed, but hardly changed data, into text files. Hard disk  space is very cheap today and having an easily read copy of data will not hurt at all. When your  application needs the data from the database, instead of hitting the database server, the application  can just include a text file. Unless the database server caches the data in its memory, embedding a  text file is an operation that is probably a thousand times faster than opening a connection to a  database.   When you include a text file, you can use a server-side include feature of the web server, which is  normally achieved by using a .shtml or .shtm file. This technique is, of course, much faster than  processing a similar JSP file because with JSP files, you need at least one extra stepâthe process  hand-over from the web server to the JSP container.   This technique presents its own problem, however: maintenance. When the data in the database  changes, its copy in the text file must also change.   The second technique, caching data in memory, is even faster. Because a server normally has  limited amount of RAM, however, you normally cache only selected data in memory.   This chapter shows you how to use these two techniques to improve your application performance.       Caching Data into a Text File   What sort of data can be cached into a text file? Almost anythingâas long as the data meets the  following criteria:      Frequently accessed     Not sensitive data, such as user names and passwords     Does not change very often   A large amount of data should qualify. These data items could include the product categories in an  online shop, the details of each product, the items in an online auction, and so on.   Consider the example of an online shop. The product categories are seldom changedâmaybe not  even once a year. These product categories, however, are accessed from the database every time a  user visits your online shop because you need to list all categories in the Search In select box.  I'm  assuming that your site has search capability because all proper online shops allow the user to      320      search for a specific product.  How many times has your application accessed the database for  exactly the same piece of data?   The code in Listing 15.1 is a typical HTML code fragment used for a search feature in a computer  book online bookstore.   Listing 15.1 HTML Code for a Search Feature in an Online Bookstore       Keyword:   Search In:        Programming     Operating System     Database     Certification                When viewed in a web browser, the code in Listing 15.1. will look similar to Figure 15.1.   Figure 15.1. The search feature in an online store.      Using JSP, on the server side, you would have the code presented in Listing 15.2.   Listing 15.2 Extracting Categories Without Caching       <%!     public void jspInit   {      try {        Class.forName "sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver" ;       }       321          catch  ClassNotFoundException e  {      }     }   %>       Keyword:      Search In:     <%       Open the Categories table     try {      String sql = "SELECT * FROM Categories";         Connection con =   DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:odbc:JavaWeb" ;        Statement s = con.createStatement  ;       ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery sql ;       while  rs.next    {        out.print "<OPTION VALUE=" ;         out.print rs.getString 1  ;         out.print ">" ;         out.print rs.getString 2  ;         out.print " \n" ;       }       s.close  ;       con.close  ;     }     catch  SQLException e  {      out.println e.toString   ;     }     catch  Exception e  {      out.println e.toString   ;     }   %>               Listing 15.3 The Categories.txt File    Programming     Operating System     Database     Certification    The JSP code is much simpler, as you see in Listing 15.4.   Listing 15.4 The JSP Code when a Text File Is Used       Keyword:      Search In:                            322  Now if you put the categories in a text file called Categories.txt that contains the text in Listing  15.3, you don't need to access the database to display the categories in the Search In select box.       Better still, you might not need a JSP page at all. You can use an .shtml extension for that page if  your web server supports it. This capability, however, relies on the web server itself and you  should consult the documentation that comes with your web server to find out more.   In the case of caching product details into text files, a reasonable approach is to copy the details of  each product to a text file and name the text file using the product's ID. What if you have one  thousand or one million products? The quantity does not matter here because if your clients have a  million products to sell, it is very likely they can afford to buy a high-speed hard disk.   The drawback of this technique is that there appears to be an inevitable maintenance problem. The  data items cached into text files are seldom changed, but they do change. When they change, you  need to have a way of updating the copy in the text file. Additionally, when a cached item is  deleted, you must also remove its copy in the text file.   The solution to this maintenance problem is to modify your administration pages so that when  something changes on the database, the copy in the text file also changes. For example, if you  cache the product category into a file, whenever you add a new product category to the database,  the categories.txt file must be updated.   The code in Listing 15.5 shows an example of the Category Admin page, which changes the copy  of the product categories in the text file. At first, the page looks similar the one shown in Figure  15.2.   Figure 15.2. The administration page to add, update, and delete categories.      Listing 15.5 The Categories Admin Page           <%!     public void jspInit   {      try {      323            Class.forName "sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver" ;       }       catch  ClassNotFoundException e  {      }     }   %>            Product Category Admin Page               Add, Update, Delete Categories          Add New Category                                    <%     String id = request.getParameter "id" ;     String category = request.getParameter "category" ;     String action = request.getParameter "action" ;     String sql;     StringBuffer categories = new StringBuffer 2048 ;       Open the Categories table     try {      Connection con =   DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:odbc:JavaWeb" ;       Statement s = con.createStatement  ;       ResultSet rs;       if  action != null && action.equals "add"   {        sql = "SELECT CategoryName FROM Categories WHERE   CategoryName='" + category + "'"; rs = s.executeQuery sql ;         if  !rs.next    {          sql = "INSERT INTO Categories  CategoryName  VALUES  '" +  category + "' ";           s.executeUpdate sql ;       }       else         out.println category + " is already in the database" ;     }     else if  action != null && action.equals "delete"   {      sql = "DELETE FROM Categories WHERE CategoryID=" + id;       s.executeUpdate sql ;     }     else if  action != null && action.equals "update"   {      sql = "UPDATE Categories SET CategoryName='" + category + "'" +         " WHERE CategoryId=" + id;       s.executeUpdate sql ;     }     sql = "SELECT CategoryID, CategoryName FROM Categories ORDER BY  CategoryName ASC";     rs = s.executeQuery sql ;          Now list all categories plus the DELETE and UPDATE buttons     out.println " " ;       324        while  rs.next    {      id = rs.getString 1 ;       category = rs.getString 2 ;   %>                  ">        ">                        ">                       <%         categories.append " " ;         categories.append category .append " \n" ;       }         out.println " " ;       s.close  ;       con.close  ;           Create a text file called Categories.txt in the specified  folder       String path = "C:\\123data\\";       FileWriter fw = new FileWriter path + "categories.txt" ;       fw.write categories.toString   ;       fw.close  ;     }     catch  SQLException e  {      out.println e.toString   ;     }     catch  Exception e  {      out.println e.toString   ;     }   %>           In the code in Listing 15.5, categories.txt is updated every time the administrator adds, deletes, or  updates a category, which solves the maintenance problem of caching data in a text file.   The path variable should be assigned the actual location of the category.txt file.   Note       Caching in Memory      325      Caching selected data in memory is preferable if you know which data is requested most often.  This data is dumped into memory at the initialization time of a servlet and is only done once.  Subsequent requests for the cached data will result in faster responses.   The code in Listing 15.6 demonstrates caching product details from the Products table in memory.  All products marked as "hot" products are retrieved from the database at initialization time and  stored in a java.util.HashMap object.   Listing 15.6 Caching Data in Memory           <%!     HashMap products = new HashMap 50 ;     public void jspInit   {      try {        Class.forName "sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver" ;         Connection con =   DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:odbc:JavaWeb" ;         Statement s = con.createStatement  ;         String sql = "SELECT ProductId, ProductName, Description,  Price" + " FROM Products" + " WHERE Hot=True";         ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery sql ;         while  rs.next    {          Product product = new Product  ;           String productId = rs.getString "ProductId" ;           product.productId = productId;           product.productName = rs.getString "ProductName" ;           product.description = rs.getString "Description" ;           product.price = rs.getFloat "Price" ;           products.put productId, product ;         }         con.close  ;       }       catch  ClassNotFoundException e  {      }       catch  Exception e  {      }     }       class Product {      String productId;       String productName;       String description;       float price;     }   %>   <%     long t1 = System.currentTimeMillis  ;   %>            Product Details            <%     String productId = request.getParameter "id" ;       productId="2";     if  productId == null  {      out.println "The request did not carry a product identifier" ;       326          return;     }     String productName = null;       String description = null;     float price = 0;       Product product =  Product  products.get productId ;     if  product != null  {      productName = product.productName;       description = product.description;       price = product.price;     }     else {         not found in the cache, grab from the database       try {        Connection con =   DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:odbc:JavaWeb" ;         Statement s = con.createStatement  ;         String sql = "SELECT ProductName, Description, Price" +           " FROM Products" +           " WHERE ProductId=" + productId;         ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery sql ;         if  rs.next    {          productName = rs.getString "ProductName" ;           description = rs.getString "Description" ;           price = rs.getFloat "Price" ;         }         rs.close  ;           s.close  ;         con.close  ;       }       catch  SQLException e  {        out.println e.toString   ;       }       catch  Exception e  {        out.println e.toString   ;       }     }   %>    Product Id:      Product Name:      Description:      Price:         <%     long t2 = System.currentTimeMillis  ;     out.println "Processing time: " +  t2 - t1  ;   %>           Each product that needs to be cached is represented by the Product class, whose definition is as  follows:   class Product {    String productId;     String productName;     String description;     float price;       327      }   The initialization code is written in the jspInit method of the JSP page. This code is executed only  once when the JSP servlet is loaded into memory.   The jspInit   method first loads the JDBC driver, opens a connection object, and retrieves all  products marked as "hot" products from the Products table, as you see here   public void jspInit   {    try {      Class.forName "sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver" ;       Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:odbc:JavaWeb" ;       Statement s = con.createStatement  ;       String sql = "SELECT ProductId, ProductName, Description, Price"  +         " FROM Products" +         " WHERE Hot=True";       ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery sql ;       .       .       .       con.close  ;     }     catch  ClassNotFoundException e  {    }     catch  Exception e  {    }   }   After you get the ResultSet object from the Statement's executeQuery method, you instantiate a  Product object, assign values to each field in the Product object, and add the Product object into  the HashMap object, as follows:   while  rs.next    {    Product product = new Product  ;     String productId = rs.getString "ProductId" ;     product.productId = productId;     product.productName = rs.getString "ProductName" ;     product.description = rs.getString "Description" ;     product.price = rs.getFloat "Price" ;     products.put productId, product ;   }   The product identifier is used as the key for each product added to the HashMap.   When a product is requested, the JSP page first checks to see whether it is available in the  HashMap. If it is, the product is obtained from the HastMap, as you see here:   Product product =  Product  products.get productId ;   if  product != null  {    productName = product.productName;     description = product.description;     price = product.price;   }   If the requested product is not available, you have to connect to the database and retrieve the  product from the Products table, like this:      328                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®            not found in the cache, grab from the database     try {      Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:odbc:JavaWeb" ;       Statement s = con.createStatement  ;       String sql = "SELECT ProductName, Description, Price" +         " FROM Products" +         " WHERE ProductId=" + productId;       ResultSet rs = s.executeQuery sql ;       if  rs.next    {        productName = rs.getString "ProductName" ;         description = rs.getString "Description" ;         price = rs.getFloat "Price" ;       }       rs.close  ;         s.close  ;       con.close  ;     }     catch  SQLException e  {      out.println e.toString   ;     }     catch  Exception e  {      out.println e.toString   ;     }   }   The JSP page is displayed in Figure 15.3.   Figure 15.3. Caching data in memory.   The JSP page also defines two variablesât1 and t2âto help measure the time taken to process the  JSP page. t1 is written at the beginning of the page, and t2 is written toward the end of the page.      You want to know the result, don't you?      329      Good news. It works!       Summary   My example shows a significant improvement. For a request for a cached product, t2 - t1 equals 0.  This, of course, only means that the processing time is too fast to measure.   For requests for products not in the cache, t2 - t1 results in between 110 and 250 milliseconds.   Conclusion: Caching data in memory really speeds up response time.   Data caching is a popular technique used on busy web sites. Caching improves scalability of the  web application because it reduces the number of times database-related resource-consumptive  operations are performed. This chapter demonstrated how you can cache data in text files as well  as in memory.      330      Chapter 16. Application Deployment   This chapter discusses the process of deploying your servlet and JSP application. To understand  how to properly display your web application, you first need to understand the directory structure  of an application. For that reason, this chapter starts with a review of the directory structure. The  next topic, which is the primary focus of the chapter, covers the deployment descriptor where you  can configure each application. Finally, this chapter helps you learn how to create an alias for your  servlet and your JSP page and then map them to a new URL. By creating an alias, you can call  your application using a shorter or more preferable URL.     Application Directory Structure   When you first install Tomcat, several directories are created under the directory in which you  install Tomcat. Figure 16.1 shows an example.   Figure 16.1. Tomcat's directory structure.      In this case, Tomcat is installed in a directory called tomcat4. This directory is also known as  %CATALINA_HOME%. See Appendix A, "Tomcat Installation and Configuration," to find  information on the function of each subdirectory.   In this chapter, you are interested in one of the subdirectories that Tomcat installation creates:  webapps. The webapps directory is the parent directory of every web application that will be run  under this Tomcat installation. When you first install Tomcat, a number of sample applications are  also created. One such application is the examples application. Figure 16.2 illustrates a webapps  directory that includes a number of applications.   Figure 16.2. The myWebApp application.      331         Let's look at the application myWebApp, which represents a typical web application. This  myWebApp directory is called the application directory.   Right under an application directory is a directory called WEB-INF, which has special  significance in a web application. Figure 16.2 shows two other directories under the myWebApp  directory: images and jsp. These two directories are optional. The jsp directory is where you store  all your JSP pages. You could place them directly under the application directories if you choose;  however, organizing all your JSP pages in separate directories is a good practice. The image  directory is used to store all the image files. Again, this image directory does not play a significant  role except to make your application more organized.   If your web application uses some static files, such as HTML files, you put them under the  application directory as well. Alternatively, again for the sake of being organized, you can create a  subdirectory under the application directory to group similar files. In a real-world application,  having a directory called html for all your HTML files is not uncommon.   As mentioned, the WEB-INF directory has a special meaning. This directory is not visible from a  client web browser, and everything you put under it is also hidden from the client. First, the WEB- INF is where you put your deployment descriptor  web.xml file . Including this deployment  descriptor is optional, but you can do a lot of things with it, as you'll see in the following section,  "Deployment Descriptor."   If you use any servlet, you must have a directory called classes under WEB-INF. Servlets that  don't belong to a package must be copied to the classes directory. For servlets with a package, you  must create a valid directory structure that reflects the Java package. In Figure 16.2, you saw a  directory structure under class for servlets that belong to the com.newriders package.   The lib directory under WEB-INF is useful if you use a library files, such as .jar files. Library files  copied here will be available to all resources in the application. If you have a library that needs to  be available to more than one application, you can put it under the lib directory under  %CATALINA_HOME%.   If you use custom tag libraries for your JSP pages, the TLD file s  must also go under WEB-INF  or in a subdirectory beneath it. In Figure 16.2, a directory called tld is created to hold all TLD files.  JavaBeans and custom tag component class files are stored in the classes directory under WEB- INF.      332          Deployment Descriptor   A deployment descriptor is an XML document that contains information describing a specific  servlet or JSP application. Some of the elements in a deployment descriptor are related to servlets,  and some are related to JSP applications.   A typical deployment descriptor starts with the following header:       This header specifies the version of XML and the encoding used. The header is followed by the  following DOCTYPE declaration:   <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">   This code specifies the document type definition  DTD  against which you can check the validity  of the XML document. The previous   element has several attributes that tell us a lot  about the DTD.   The following list describes the information you can learn from the   element:      web-app defines the root element of this document  deployment descriptor, not DTD file .     PUBLIC means that the DTD file is intended for public use.      "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN" means that the DTD is  maintained by Sun Microsystems, Inc. This information also tells us that the type of the  document it describes is DTD Web Application 2.3, and the DTD is written in English.     The URL " http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd "> represents the location of the   DTD file.   Warning   Note   Note that the DTD file location shown in the preceding list is a new address: The DTD  file location used to be http:  java.sun.com j2ee dtds web-app_2_3.dtd.   The root element of a deployment descriptor is web-app. This element can have up to 23 kinds of  subelements, all of which are optional. Some subelements can appear only once, and others can  appear more than once. Additionally, some of these subelements can have subelements.   For those of you who are not XML experts, here are some notes that can be useful in  understanding the following discussion about DTDs:   x+ : one or more occurrences of x.   x* : zero or more occurrences of x.   x? : optional x.      333      x, y : x followed by y.   x  y : x or y   PCDATA = parsed character data. Parsed character data is text that does not contain  markup, but rather simple character data.   According to the DTD file, the syntax of the web-app element's subelements is briefly described  as follows:   <!ELEMENT web-app  icon?, display-name?, description?, distributable?,  context-param*,   filter*, filter-mapping*, listener*, servlet*, servlet-mapping*,  session-config?,  mime-mapping*, welcome-file-list?, error-page*, taglib*, resource- env-ref*, resource-ref*,   security-constraint*, login-config?, security-role*,env-entry ejb- ref*, ejb-local-ref* >   The question mark  ?  character indicates that a subelement is optional and can appear only once.  The asterisks  *  are used to specify subelements that can appear more than once in the  deployment descriptor. The description of the subelements indicates that all subelements are  optional.   Following this web-app element declaration comes the declarations of each subelement. This  chapter discusses each element based on its functionality.   Note   Subelements must appear in the order specified previously. For example, if the web-app  element in a deployment descriptor has both servlet and servlet-mapping subelements, the  servlet subelement must appear before the servlet-mapping subelement.   A deployment descriptor generally looks like the following:         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com j2ee dtds web-app_2.3.dtd">                    value of subelement-1 of element-1         value of subelement-2 of element-1        .       .       .                    value of subelement-1 of element-2         value of subelement-2 of element-2        .       .       .             .       334        .     .                value of subelement-1 of element-n         value of subelement-2 of element-n        .       .       .             The following example shows the deployment descriptor of a servlet application:         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com j2ee dtds web-app_2.3.dtd">                    HttpRequestDemo         HttpRequestDemoServlet                     Primitive         PrimitiveServlet                     ConfigDemo         ConfigDemoServlet                   adminEmail           admin@brainysoftware.com                           adminContactNumber           0414371237                      A deployment descriptor, like other XML documents, can also contain comments. A  comment in XML is anything between the   tag.   The subelements are explained in the following sections. An example is given for each subelement.   Note   icon   The icon element contains an optional small-icon subelement and an optional large-icon  subelement. Its element description is as follows:                  335      The icon element is used to specify the filenames for a small  16 x 16  and or a large  32 x 32   icon in either GIF or JPEG format. The filename is a path relative to the root of the web  application archive  WAR .   The icon can be used by an XML tool if you happen to use a tool to edit your deployment  descriptor. The web container does not use this element.   For example, the following is a deployment descriptor that uses an icon element. The icon element  has both a small icon and a large icon:         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                     CompanyLogo.jpg          CompanyBigLogo.jpg              display-name   The display-name element contains a name to be displayed by an XML tool if you use a tool to  edit your deployment descriptor. The element descriptor for display-name is as  follows: . The following example is a deployment  descriptor that has both icon and display-name elements:         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                       CompanyLogo.jpg           CompanyBigLogo.jpg               Superposition Marketing        description   You use the description element to provide information about the deployment descriptor. The  value of the description element can be used by an XML tool.   The description element has the following element descriptor:       The following is an example of a deployment descriptor that uses a description element:             336      <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">            Superposition Marketing       This application tracks statistical  changes        distributable   If present in a deployment descriptor, the distributable element indicates that the application is  written to be deployed into a distributed web container. The syntax for this element is as follows:       For example, the following is a deployment descriptor that contains a distributable element:         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">            Superposition Marketing              context-param   The context-param element contains a pair of parameter names and values used as the  application's servlet context initialization parameter. The parameter name must be unique  throughout the web application. The syntax for the context-param element and its subelements is  as follows:                   The param-name subelement contains the parameter name, and the param-value subelement  contains the parameter value. Optionally, a description subelement also can be present to describe  the parameter.   The following is a valid deployment descriptor with a few context-param elements:         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                    adminName        337      filter        Tommy Matena                   initValue         8060         the port number used              This element specifies a filter in the web application. The filter is mapped either to a servlet or a  URL pattern using the filter-mapping element described in the next section. The filter element and  the filter-mapping element that does the mapping for this filter must have the same name. Filters  are discussed in Chapter 7, "Servlet Filtering."   The element descriptor for filter is as follows:   <!ELEMENT filter  icon?, filter-name, display-name?, description?,   filter-class, init-param* >           The icon, display-name, and description elements are the same as the previous sections. The init- param has the same element descriptor as context-param.   The filter-name element defines the name of the filter. The filter name must be unique within the  application. The filter-class element specifies the fully qualified name for the filter class.   The following is a valid deployment descriptor for a web application that uses two filters:  UpperCaseFilter and Double Filter:         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                             UpperCase Filter                         UpperCaseFilter                                     Double Filter                         DoubleFilter                          frequency           1909                338                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®                 filter-mapping   The filter-mapping element declares the filter mappings in the web application. A filter can be  mapped either to a servlet or a URL pattern. Mapping a filter to a servlet causes the filter to work  on the servlet. Mapping a filter to a URL pattern makes filtering occur to any resource whose URL  matches the URL pattern. Filtering is performed in the same order as the appearance of filter- mapping elements in the deployment descriptor.   The element descriptor for filter-mapping is as follows:                   The filter-name value must match one of the filter names declared in the filter elements.   The following is a deployment descriptor that contains two filter-mapping elements:         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                                   Basic Filter                         BasicFilter                                     Advanced Filter                         AdvancedFilter                                           Basic Filter                         FilteredServlet                                     Advanced Filter               339                     *                     listener   The listener element is used to register a listener class that you include in a web application. The  listener element has the following element descriptor:           The following is a valid deployment descriptor containing a listener element:         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                             AppLifeCycleEvent                     servlet   The servlet element is used to declare a servlet. It has the following element descriptor:   <!ELEMENT servlet  icon?, servlet-name, display-name?, description?,    servlet-classjsp-file , init-param*, load-on-startup?, run-as?,   security-role-ref* >                               The icon, display-name, and description elements are described in the previous sections. The init- param element descriptor is the same as context-param.   A servlet element must contain a servlet-name element and a servlet-class element, or a servlet- name element and a jsp-file element. The servlet-name element defines the name for that servlet  and must be unique thoroughout the application.   The servlet-class element specifies the fully qualified class name of the servlet.   The jsp-file element specifies the full path to a JSP file within the application. The full path must  begin with a  .      340      You use the init-param subelement to pass an initial parameter name and value to the servlet.   The load-on-startup element is used to load the servlet automatically into memory when the web  container starts up. Loading a servlet means instantiating the servlet and calling its init method.  You use this element to avoid delay in the response for the first request to the servlet, caused by  the servlet loading to memory. If this element is present and a jsp-file element is specified, the JSP  file is precompiled into a servlet and the resulting servlet is loaded.   The content of a load-on-startup value is either empty or an integer number. The value indicates  the order of loading into memory by the web container. For example, if there are two servlet  elements and both contain load-on-startup subelements, the servlet with a lower number in the  load-on-startup subelement is loaded first. If the value of the load-on-startup is empty or a  negative number, it is up to the web container to decide when to load the servlet. If two servlets  have the same value for their load-on-startup subelements, the web container is free to choose  which servlet to load first.   If a run-as element is defined, it overrides the security identity used to call an Enterprise Java  Bean by that servlet in this web application. The role-name is one of the security roles defined for  the current web application.   The security-role-ref element defines a mapping between the name of the role called from a servlet  using isUserInRole String name  and the name of a security role defined for the web application.  The security-role-ref element is described as follows:                   The role-link element is used to link a security role reference to a defined security role. The role- link element must contain the name of one of the security roles defined in the security-role  elements.   For example, to map the security role reference "MG" to the security role with role-name  "manager," the syntax would be as follows:          MG       manager        In this case, if the servlet called by a user belonging to the "manager" security role made the API  call isUserInRole "MG" , the result would be true. The role-name "*" is not permitted because it  has a special meaning for authorization constraints.   The following is a deployment descriptor containing several servlet elements:         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                             First       341                            FirstServlet                         1                                     JDBCServlet                         com.newriders.db.JDBCServlet                         2                     servlet-mapping   The servlet-mapping element maps a URL pattern to a servlet. The element descriptor for servlet- mapping is as follows:               The following is a deployment descriptor that maps a servlet with a URL pattern. For more details,  see the section "Servlet Alias and Mapping," later in this chapter.         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                    AnAlias         com.newriders.OtherServlet                           AnAlias          newURL              session-config   The session-config element defines the parameters for the javax.servlet.http.HttpSession objects in  the web application. The element descriptor is as follows:              342      The session-timeout element specifies the default session timeout interval in minutes. This value  must be an integer. If the value of the session-timeout element is zero or a negative number, the  session will never time out.   The following is a deployment descriptor that makes the default HttpSession object invalid 10  minutes after the last access from the user:         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                           10                     mime-mapping   The mime-mapping element maps a mime type to an extension. Its element decriptor is as follows:               The extension element describes the extension, and mime-type is the MIME type. For example,  the following deployment descriptor maps the extension "txt" to "text plain":         <!DOCTYPE web-app       PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"       "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                             txt                         text plain                     welcome-file-list   The welcome-file-list element specifies the default file that is displayed when the URL entered by  the user in the browser does not contain a servlet name or a JSP page. For example, assume the  user types in something like the following:   http:  www.yourdomain.com appName       343      If no welcome-file-list element is specified in the deployment descriptor for a web application, the  user sees a permission error message or the list of files and directories in the application directory.   The welcome-file-list is described as follows:           The welcome-file subelement contains the default filename. A welcome-file-list element can  contain one or more welcome-file subelements. If the file specified in the first welcome-file  element cannot be found, the web container will try to display the second one, and so on.   The following is a deployment descriptor that contains a welcome-file-list element. The element  contains two welcome-file elements. The first welcome-file specifies a file in the application  directory called index.html; the second defines the welcome.html file under the src directory,  which is under the application directory:         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                             index.html                         src welcome.html                     If the index.html file is not found in the application directory when a user types a URL that does  not contain a servlet name or a JSP page or other resource, the welcome.html file in the src  directory will be displayed.   error-page   The error-page element maps an error code or an exception type to a resource path in the web  application, so that if a particular HTTP error or a specified Java exception occurs, the resource  will be displayed instead. Its element descriptor is as follows:                   The error-code element contains an HTTP error code, exception type is the fully qualified name of  a Java exception type, and location is the path to the resource in the web application relative to the  application directory. The value of location must start with a  .   For example, the following deployment descriptor causes the web container to display the  error.html page in the application directory every time the HTTP 404 error code occurs:           344      taglib     <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                             404                          error.html                     The taglib element describes a JSP custom tag library. The taglib element is described as follows:               The taglib-uri element is the URI of the tag library used in the web application. The value for  taglib-uri is relative to the location of the deployment descriptor.   The taglib-location contains the location where the TLD file for the tag library can be found.   The following is a deployment descriptor that contains taglib elements:       <!DOCTYPE taglib     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                           http:  java.apache.org tomcat examples-taglib                          WEB-INF jsp example-taglib.tld                     resource-env-ref   You use the resource-env-ref element to specify a declaration of a servlet's reference to an  administered object associated with a resource in the servlet's environment. The element  descriptor of resource-env-ref is as follows:   <!ELEMENT resource-env-ref  description?, resource-env-ref-name,   resource-env-ref-type >              345      The resource-env-ref-name is the name of a resource environment reference whose value is the  entry name of the environment used in servlet code. The name is a Java Naming and Directory  Interface  JNDI  name relative to the java:comp env context and must be unique throughout the  web application.   resource-env-ref-type defines the type of a resource environment reference. Its value must be the  fully qualified name of a Java class or interface.   As an example, the following deployment descriptor contains a resource-env-ref element:         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                    jms XQueue         javax.jms.Queue              resource-ref   The resource-ref element specifies a declaration of a servlet's reference to an external resource. Its  element descriptor is as follows:   <!ELEMENT resource-ref  description?, res-ref-name, res-type, res- auth,   res-sharing-scope? >                       The subelements of resource-ref are described as follows:   res-ref-name is the name of the resource factory reference name. The name is a JNDI  name relative to the java:comp env context. The name must be unique throughout the web  application.  res-auth indicates whether the servlet code signs on programmatically to the resource  manager or whether the Container will sign on to the resource manager on the servlet's  behalf. The value of this element must be either Application or Container.  res-sharing-scope indicates whether connections obtained through the given resource  manager connection factory reference can be shared. The value of this element must be  either Shareable  default  or Unshareable.   The following is a deployment descriptor that contains a resource-ref element:         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                     346                     JDBC Data Source         db JDBCDatabase         javax.sql.DataSource         Application         Unshareable              security-constraint   The security-constraint in the deployment descriptor allows you to restrict access to certain  resources without programming. To use this element, you should understand some security terms  discussed in Chapter 14, "Security Configuration."   The security-constraint element is described as follows:   <!ELEMENT security-constraint  display-name?, web-resource- collection+,   auth-constraint?, user-data-constraint? >       <!ELEMENT web-resource-collection  web-resource-name, description?,   url-pattern*, http-method* >           The web-resource-collection element identifies a subset of resources to which access needs to be  restricted. In the web-resource-collection, you can define the URL pattern s  and the HTTP  method. If no HTTP method is present, the security constraint applies to all methods.   The auth-constraint element specifies the user roles that should have access to this resource  collection. If no auth-constraint element is specified, the security constraint applies to all roles.   The user-data-constraint element is used to indicate how data transmitted between the client and  web container must be protected.   The description of the web-resource-collection element is shown as follows:   <!ELEMENT web-resource-collection  web-resource-name, description?,   url-pattern*, http-method* >                   The web-resource-name is a name associated with the protected resource.   The http-method element can be assigned one of the HTTP methods, such as GET and POST.   The description of the auth-constraint element is shown here:                  347      The role-name element contains the name of a security role.   The description of the user-data-constraint element is given here:               The transport-guarantee element must have one of the following values: NONE, INTEGRAL, or  CONFIDENTIAL. NONE means that the application does not require transport guarantees.  INTEGRAL means that the data between the server and the client should be sent in such a way  that it can't be changed in transit. CONFIDENTIAL means that the data transmitted must be  encrypted. In most cases, Secure Sockets Layer  SSL  is used for either INTEGRAL or  CONFIDENTIAL.   The following is a deployment descriptor that restricts access to any resource with a URL  matching the pattern  servlet  *. Only a user in a manager role will be allowed access. The login- config element will require a user to log in and the Basic authentication method is used. The user  must then enter the user name and password of the manager role to successfully log in:         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                                         Restricted Area                     servlet *                         manager                               BASIC         User Basic Authentication              login-config   The login-config element is used to specify the authentication method used, the realm name, and  the attributes needed by the form login mechanism. Its element descriptor is as follows:   <!ELEMENT login-config  auth-method?, realm-name?, form-login- config? >               The auth-method specifies the authentication method. Its value is one of the following: BASIC,  DIGEST, FORM, or CLIENT-CERT.      348                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       The realm name element specifies the realm name to use in HTTP Basic authorization.   The form-login-config element specifies the login and error pages that should be used in form- based login. If form-based authentication is not used, these elements are ignored.   The form-login-config element is further elaborated as follows:               The form-login-page element specifies a path to a resource that displays a Login page. The path  must start with a   and is relative to the application directory.   The form-error-page element specifies a path to a resource that displays an error page when user  login fails. The path must begin with a   and is relative to the application directory.   security-role   The security-role element specifies the declaration of a security role used in the security- constraints. It is described as follows:               The following deployment descriptor illustrates the use of the security-role element:         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                manager              env-entry   The env-entry element specifies an application environment entry. This element is described using  the following descriptor:   <!ELEMENT env-entry  description?, env-entry-name, env-entry-value?,   env-entry-type >                   The env-entry-name element contains the name of a web application's environment entry. The  name is a JNDI name relative to the java:comp env context. The name must be unique throughout  the application.      349   The env-entry-value element contains the value of a web application's environment entry. The  value must be a String that is valid for the constructor of the specified type that takes a single  String parameterâor for java.lang.Character, a single character.   The env-entry-type element contains the fully qualified Java type of the environment entry value  that is expected by the web application's code. This element must have one of the following values:      java.lang.Boolean   java.lang.Byte   java.lang.Character   java.lang.String   java.lang.Short   java.lang.Integer   java.lang.Long   java.lang.Float   java.lang.Double   The ejb-ref element specifies a reference to an Enterprise JavaBean's home. Its descriptor is as  follows:   <!ELEMENT ejb-ref  description?, ejb-ref-name, ejb-ref-type, home,   remote, ejb-link? >                           The ejb-ref-name element contains the name of an EJB reference. The EJB reference is an entry in  the servlet's environment and is relative to the java:comp env context. The name must be unique  within the web application. Its name is recommended to begin with "ejb ".   The ejb-ref-type element contains the expected type of the referenced enterprise bean. The value  of the ejb-ref-type element must be either Entity or Session.   The home element contains the fully qualified name of the enterprise bean's home interface.   The remote element contains the fully qualified name of the enterprise bean's remote interface.   The ejb-link element is used in the ejb-ref or ejb-local-ref elements to specify that an EJB  reference is linked to another enterprise bean.   The value of the ejb-link element must be the ejb-name of an enterprise bean in the same J2EE  application unit.   The name in the ejb-link element may be composed of a path name specifying the ejb-jar  containing the referenced enterprise bean. The ejb-name of the target bean has been appended and  separated from the path name by using . The path name is relative to the WAR containing the  web application that is referencing the enterprise bean. This allows multiple enterprise beans with  the same ejb-name to be identified uniquely.   The ejb-local-ref element is used for the declaration of a reference to an enterprise bean's local  home. It is described as follows:      350      <!ELEMENT ejb-local-ref  description?, ejb-ref-name, ejb-ref-type,  local-home, local,   ejb-link? >                           The local element contains the fully qualified name of the enterprise bean's local interface.   The local-home element contains the fully qualified name of the enterprise bean's local home  interface.       Servlet Alias and Mapping   With Tomcat, you actually don't need a deployment descriptor for a servlet. Consider the  following directory structure given in Figure 16.3. This is the structure for a web application  called myApp.   Figure 16.3. The directory structure for myApp.   As long as you put your servlet class file under the classes directory under myApp, your servlet  should be accessible from the following URL:      http:  domain myApp servlet ServletClassName.   For instance, if your servlet is called TestingServlet and your domain name is  www.blahblahblah.com, the URL to the servlet is the following:  http:  www.blahblahblah.com myApp servlet TestingServlet   Note   Note that the servlet is accessed through the default port 8080. Appendix A provides  information on how to make your servlet work on a non-default port.   The previous URL assumes that the servlet is not contained in a package. If the servlet is part of a  package, you must store your class file under a directory structure that reflects the Java package.  For example, the following servlet called OtherServlet is part of the package com.newriders.   First, you need the directory structure given in Figure 16.4. The OtherServlet class file must be  stored in the newriders directory.      351      Figure 16.4. The directory structure for a servlet in a package.   The servlet then can be accessed using the following URL:   http:  domain myApp servlet com.newriders.OtherServlet      You can see that the package name is reflected in the URL; however, the deployment descriptor  allows you to call your servlet by another name. This simply means you can make your servlet  available with a non-standard URL.   For example, the deployment descriptor in Listing 16.1 creates an alias called AnAlias for  com.newriders.OtherServlet.   Listing 16.1 The Deployment Descriptor that Provides an Alias         <!DOCTYPE web-app       PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"       "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                    AnAlias         com.newriders.OtherServlet              In the deployment descriptor, first you define a name  AnAlias  for the servlet  com.newriders.OtherServlet. Then your servlet is available from both of the following URLs:   http:  domain myApp servlet com.newriders.OtherServlet   http:  domain myApp servlet AnAlias   In the preceding example, the URL still must contain the word "servlet," even though you can  choose your own name. With servlet-mapping, you can remove the word "servlet" from the URL.  The next example shows you how to create a different URL for the previous servlet   com.newriders.OtherServlet  using the deployment descriptor in Listing 16.2.   Listing 16.2 The Deployment Descriptor that Provides Mapping         <!DOCTYPE web-app       PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"       "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">         352                     AnAlias         com.newriders.OtherServlet                           AnAlias          newURL              Now, you can access your servlet using the following three URLs:   http:  localhost:8080 myApp servlet com.newriders.OtherServlet   http:  localhost:8080 myApp servlet AnAlias   http:  localhost:8080 myApp newURL   Note that the word "servlet" disappears in the third URL.   The URL pattern can go beyond a simple word. For example, to give the impression that the class  file is in a subdirectory, consider the deployment descriptor in Listing 16.3.   Listing 16.3 The Deployment Descriptor that Uses a More Complex Map         <!DOCTYPE web-app       PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"       "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                    AnAlias         com.newriders.OtherServlet                           AnAlias          newURL level-1 level-2              Now you can use the following URL to access your servlet:   http:  domain myApp newURL level-1 level-2   Note also that you can use the wild-card character * to indicate that you accept anything. For  example, the URL pattern  whatever  * will make your servlet accessible with any URL that ends  with  whatever , such as:   http:  domain myApp whatever noname   http:  domain myApp whatever favorite      JSP Alias and Mapping      353      With a JSP application, you have a similar directory structure as that of a servlet application.  Consider a JSP application named myJSPApp. This application has the directory structure given in  Figure 16.5.   Figure 16.5. The directory structure for a JSP application called myJSPApp.      You store your JSP files in the myJSPApp directory and additional class files under the WEB- INF classes directory. The JSP page then is callable using the following URL:   http:  domain appName pageName   This means that if your domain and domain name is www.blahblahblah.com, your application  name is myJSPApp, and the page is called SimplePage.jsp, once you register your application in  the server.xml file  see Appendix A , the URL to access the page is as follows:   http:  www.blahblahblah.com myJSPApp SimplePage.jsp   If you don't have a JavaBean and tag library, you don't even need the WEB-INF file. If you are  happy with the URL to access your JSP page, you don't need a deployment descriptor, either.   Using a deployment descriptor, however, you can configure your application. Among other things,  you can create an alias so that you can access your JSP page with another name.   For example, the following is a deployment descriptor that provides an alias for a JSP page called  SimplePage.jsp:         <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"     "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">                             AnAlias                          SimplePage.jsp                1              Note   Having a web application that consists of both servlets and JSP pages as well as other  resources is very common. In this case, servlet classes and JSP pages can be stored in  their own directories without affecting each other.      354        Packaging and Deploying a Web Application   You can deploy an application with the directory structure explained in the previous section.  There is a more elegant way for deploying your application, however; you can first package your  application into a web archive  WAR  file. A web archive file has a .war extension.   Basically, a WAR file is a .jar file you create using the jar program. Into a WAR file, you package  every file in an application. The name of the WAR file normally is the same as the application  name; however, you can use any name you like.   After you have a WAR file, you deploy it under the webapps directory. You then can access your  application just as you would an unpackaged application. The name used for your packaged  application is the .war filename. For example, if you package an application called myApp into a  WAR file called dontcare.war, when deployed, the application name is dontcare, not myApp. This  is the result because when you archive your application, the application name is not included in  the WAR file.       Summary   This chapter explained to you how you can configure and deploy your web application. The  chapter started by introducing the directory structure of a typical application and then moved to an  explanation of the deployment descriptor.   After the application is ready for deployment, you can deploy it by retaining the files and directory  structure of your application. Alternatively, you can package the application into a WAR file and  deploy the whole application using a single file.      355      Chapter 17. Architecting Java Web Applications   Now that you know the techniques, tips, and tricks for working with servlets and JSP, it is time to  look at the architectural designs of a Java web application. Two models are commonly used and  this chapter explains them and shows why JSP does not make servlets obsolete. In fact, in  complex applications, JSP pages and servlets go hand in hand.   The terms for the two architectural designs first appeared in the early drafts of the JSP  specifications: Model 1 and Model 2. These two terms are not mentioned in the more current JSP  specification documents. However, the designs are still widely in use today. The models are  explained in the next two sections. Similar applications are given in both Model 1 and Model 2 to  illustrate the models' differences.   Note   A project based on Model 2 application is presented in Chapter 18, "Developing E- Commerce Applications."     Model 1 Architecture   In Model 1 architecture, the application is page-centric. The client browser navigates through a  series of JSP pages in which any JSP page can employ a JavaBean that performs business  operations. However, the highlight of this architecture is that each JSP page processes its own  input. Applications implementing this architecture normally have a series of JSP pages where the  user is expected to proceed from the first page to the next. If needed, a servlet or an HTML page  can be substituted for the JSP page in the series.   The Model 1 architecture is depicted in Figure 17.1.   Figure 17.1. Model 1 architecture.   Example of Model 1 Architecture: A Login Application   The following example is a Login application that uses the Model 1 architecture. It consists of  three JSP pages and a JavaBean. As the name implies, this application is for users to log in. The  sequence of this series of JSP applications starts from the Login.jsp page that is given in Listing  17.1      Listing 17.1 Login.jsp                Login            356              <%     if  request.getParameter "error"  != null  {  %>   Login failed. Please try again        <%     }   %>              User Name                       Password                                                The Login.jsp page is nothing more than an HTML page with a form. The only code present is the  scriplet after the   tag that checks to see if the request object contains a parameter called  "error". If so, a message is displayed.   <%     if  request.getParameter "error"  != null  {  %>   Login failed. Please try again        <%     }   %>   The form in the Login page is submitted to the second JSP pageâProcessLogin.jsp, which is  illustrated in Listing 17.2.   Listing 17.2 ProcessLogin.jsp           <%     if  loginBean.login request.getParameter "userName" ,       request.getParameter "password"          request.getRequestDispatcher "Welcome.jsp" .forward request,  response ;     else         we have to use sendRedirect because we want to send the ?error  part         to the Login.jsp page.         with RequestDispatcher.forward  , the URL will still be         the current URL       response.sendRedirect "Login.jsp?error=yes" ;   %>      357      This page employs a JavaBean called model1.LoginBean. The ProcessLogin.jsp page calls the  login method of the bean, passing the userName parameter and the password parameter of the  request object. The login method returns true if the user is an authorized user. It returns false  otherwise.   In a successful login the ProcessLogin.jsp page displays the Welcome page.   if  loginBean.login request.getParameter "userName" ,       request.getParameter "password"          request.getRequestDispatcher "Welcome.jsp" .forward request,  response ;     .     .     .   Note that rather than using the sendRedirect method of the javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse  interface, use a request dispatcher obtained from the getRequestDispatcher method of the request  object. Then, the RequestDispatcher object's forward method transfers processing to the  Welcome.jsp page. The forward method is faster than the sendRedirect method because there is no  round trip to the client, such as with the sendRedirect method.   If the login failed, however, the user is sent back to the Login.jsp page.   response.sendRedirect "Login.jsp?error=yes" ;   In this example, the sendRedirect method of the javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse interface  is used because we need to send the "error" parameter in the URL. Alternatively, the attribute in  the request object can be used as shown in the example in the section "Model 2 Architecture,"  later in this chapter.   The Welcome.jsp page is given in Listing 17.3.   Listing 17.3 Welcome.jsp                Welcome            Welcome. You have successfully logged in.           The JavaBean used in the ProcessLogin.jsp page is given in Listing 17.4.   Listing 17.4 LoginBean.java   package model1;     public class LoginBean {    public boolean login String userName, String password  {      if  userName == null  password == null          ! userName.equals "aibo"  && password.equals "kitada"            return false;       else         return true;       358                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®         }   }   In the login method in the JavaBean, a successful login occurs if the userName equals "aibo" and  the password is the same as "kitada". The login method is purposely very simple. In a real-life  application, these two values are normally matched against a database table.   To test the application, complete the following steps:   1.  Use the myJSPApp application.  2.  Copy all the .jsp pages in the myJSPApp directory under webapps.  3.  Compile the LoginBean.java and copy the .class file into the WEB-INF classes model1    directory.   4.  Restart Tomcat and load the Login page using the following URL:   http:  localhost:8080 myJSPApp Login.jsp.   This application is illustrated in Figures 17.2 to 17.4.   Figure 17.2. The Login page.   Figure 17.3. The Welcome page.         359      Figure 17.4. The Login page after a failed login.         The Advantages and Disadvantages of Model 1 Architecture   The advantage of this model is its ease of development. This architectural design, therefore, is  suitable for small projects, or when you want to quickly finish something.   Two disadvantages of this model are as follows:      360          It is hard to achieve division of labor between the page designer and the web developer  because normally the web developer needs to be involved in the development of the page  and the business objects.      Model 1 architecture is hard to maintain and it is not flexible. This is especially true for   large projects.   Due to the drawbacks of this architectural design, Model 2 architecture was introduced.       Model 2 Architecture   The Model 2 architecture is basically a Model-View-Controller  MVC  architecture that separates  content generation and content presentation. A Model 2 architecture is indicated by the presence  of a controller servlet between the client browser and the JSP pages  or the servlets that present  the content . The controller servlet dispatches HTTP requests to the corresponding presentation  JSP pagesâbased on the request URL, input parameters, and application state. In this model,  presentation parts  JSP pages or servlets  are isolated from each other.   Model 2 applications are more flexible and easier to maintain, and to extend, because views do not  reference each other directly. The Model 2 controller servlet provides a single point of control for  security and logging, and often encapsulates incoming data into a form usable by the back-end  MVC model.   Warning   Unless you are sure that your small application will remain small, always elect Model 2  as the architectural design of your application. It is true that Model 2 architecture adds  some complexity to the application. However, an MVC application framework can  greatly simplify the implementation of a Model 2 application.   Figure 17.5 depicts the Model 2 architecture.   Figure 17.5. Model 2 architecture.   Example of Model 2 Application   To illustrate the use of Model 2 architecture, the following example is the rewrite of the previous  Login application described in the section "Model 1 Architecture."   At the center is the controller servlet, which is the single entry point of the application. The servlet  is named Model2Servlet and is given in Listing 17.5.      Listing 17.5 The Model2Servlet      361      import javax.servlet.*;     public class Model2Servlet extends GenericServlet {      public void service ServletRequest request, ServletResponse  response        throws ServletException, java.io.IOException {        String userName = request.getParameter "userName" ;       String password = request.getParameter "password" ;         if  userName == null  {        RequestDispatcher rd =  request.getRequestDispatcher " Login.jsp" ;         rd.forward request, response ;       }       else {        if  password != null && userName.equals "aibo"            && password.equals "kitada"   {             login successful           RequestDispatcher rd =  request.getRequestDispatcher " Welcome.jsp" ;           rd.forward request, response ;         }         else {             login failed           request.setAttribute "error", "yes" ;           RequestDispatcher rd =  request.getRequestDispatcher " Login.jsp" ;           rd.forward request, response ;         }       }     }   }   The application is very simple because there are only two JSP pages for presentation: the Login  page and the Welcome page. The Login page is used for the user to log in, and the Welcome page  is displayed after a successful login. Therefore, the servlet dispatches the request either to the  Login page or to the Welcome page.   However, how does the servlet know what JSP page to dispatch to? The answer lies in the logic  inside the service method of the servlet.   The service method checks for a parameter called userName in the ServletRequest object.  Absence of this parameter results in the servlet dispatching the request to the Login page.   if  userName == null  {    RequestDispatcher rd = request.getRequestDispatcher " Login.jsp" ;     rd.forward request, response ;   }   Therefore, the first time the user requests a page from the application, the Login page displays  because there is no userName parameter in the request.   If the userName parameter is present, the controller servlet knows that the user is trying to log in.  The servlet then checks to see if the username is "aibo" and the password is "kitada". If so, the  servlet dispatches the request to the Welcome.jsp page.   if  password != null && userName.equals "aibo"  &&       362        password.equals "kitada"   {       login successful     RequestDispatcher rd = request.getRequestDispatcher " Welcome.jsp" ;     rd.forward request, response ;   }   Otherwise, it returns the user to the Login page after setting an attribute called error in the  ServletRequest object. The presence of this attribute makes the Login.jsp page display an error  message.   The Login.jsp and Welcome.jsp are given in Listings 17.6 and 17.7 respectively.   Listing 17.6 Login Page                Login                <%     if  request.getAttribute "error"  != null  {  %>   Login failed. Please try again        <%     }   %>              User Name                       Password                                                Listing 17.7 Welcome Page                Welcome            Welcome. You have successfully logged in.           To test this application, complete the following steps:      363   1.  Copy Login.jsp and Welcome.jsp to the myJSPApp directory.  2.  Compile the servlet and copy the .class file into the WEB-INF classes directory.  3.  Restart Tomcat and type the following in the browser:   http:  localhost:8080 myJSPApp servlet Model2Servlet          Summary   This chapter briefly explains the two models of Java web application design: Model 1 and Model  2. Model 1 architecture provides rapid development for small projects, and is suitable for small  projects that will remain small or for building prototypes. Model 2 is the recommended  architecture for any medium-sized to large projects. Model 2 is harder to build, but it provides  more maintainability and extensibility.   Chapter 18 presents an e-commerce application that is built based on Model 2 architectural design.      364      Chapter 18. Developing E-Commerce Applications   In Chapter 17, "Architecting Java Web Applications," you learned that there are two design  models you can adopt to build Java web applications with servlets and JSP. The first model,  simply called Model 1, is a page-centric model in which an application consists of a series of JSP  pages. In this model, a JSP page calls another JSP page. Developing applications based on this  model is very easy; however, for complex applications, this model presents maintenance  nightmares. Therefore, this model is suitable only for small applications that will never grow in  complexity.   The second model, Model 2, is a Model-View-Controller  MVC  architecture that separates  content generation and content presentation. A Model 2 architecture is indicated by the presence  of a controller servlet between the client browser and the JSP pages or servlet content that presents  the content. The controller servlet dispatches HTTP requests to the corresponding presentation  JSP pages based on the request URL, input parameters, and application state. In this model,  presentation parts  JSP pages or servlets  are isolated from each other.   Model 2 applications are more flexible and easier to maintain and extend because views do not  reference each other directly. The Model 2 controller servlet provides a single point of control for  security and logging, and often encapsulates incoming data into a form usable by the back-end  MVC model.   Model 2 architecture is recommended for complex applications. Building an application using this  model is not as simple as using Model 1; however, this model offers many advantages over the  first model. In this chapter, you see how this model is used in an e-commerce application that  implements an online store.   The project is called Burnaby  named after the city east of Vancouver, British Columbia , and it is  an online store that sells foods in many different categories. Here you can find chocolate, biscuits,  milk, cheese, and other things you normally might find in a superstore. The project's sole purpose  is to demonstrate how Model 2 applications can be designed and developed. For brevity and  clarity, little or no error handling has been included and no optimization is used. The graphic  design also is kept simple. A Microsoft Access database accompanies this project and is ready to  use if you happen to be using Windows. Otherwise, you can build your own database based on the  database structure given in the section, "The Database Structure," with any favorite database  server, as long as there is a JDBC driver for that database server.       Project Specification   If you have shopped online or browsed an electronic store such as Amazon.com, you will easily  understand the specification for this project.   Loosely defined, the application you will be building is an online store users can visit and do the  following things:      Search for certain products based on product names or descriptions     Browse the list of products by category     View a product's details     Place a product in the shopping cart     View and edit the shopping cart      365         Check out and place an order       The Database Structure   For simplicity, a Microsoft Access database is used as the example in this chapter. For deployment,  however, you are encouraged to port it in a more scalable and powerful database. The Access  database file is located in the \db directory under the application's WEB-INF directory. You use  four tables for this project: Categories, Products, Orders, and OrderDetails. The structure of each  table is given next.   The Categories Table   The Categories table is used to store product categories. It is a simple table whose design is given  in Table 18.1.   Table 18.1. The Structure of the Categories Table  Column Name   Data Type   AutoNumber  Text   CategoryId  Category   The Products Table   The Products table is used to store the details of every product sold. Its structure is presented in  Table 18.2. Note that the table uses a CategoryId column to categorize the products.   Table 18.2. The Structure of the Products Table   Column Name   Data Type   ProductId  CategoryId  Name  Description  Price   The Orders Table   AutoNumber  Number  Text  Text  Number   The Orders table holds order information, including the delivery address, the credit card details,  and the contact name. A unique identifier is used for each order, which is used to link to all  shopping items in the OrderDetails table.   The structure of the Orders table is given in Table 18.3.   Table 18.3. The Structure of the Orders Table  Column Name   Data Type   OrderId  ContactName  DeliveryAddress   Number  Text  Text      366   The OrderDetails table is used to store all shopping items for each order. Its structure is given in  Table 18.4.   Table 18.4. The Structure of the OrderDetails Table  Column Name   Data Type   Text  Text  Text   AutoNumber  Number  Number  Number  Number   For consistency in the look and feel of the application, every JSP page uses the same design.  There is a header on top of each page and a menu on the left. Every page has the following  structure:      CCName  CCNumber  CCExpiryDate   The OrderDetails Table   Id  OrderId  ProductId  Quantity  Price        Page Design                                                                                          Preparation   Before you start coding, you need to do these steps in preparation:      367      1.  Copy the directory Burnaby and its content from the software burnaby directory on the  CD to %CATALINA_HOME% webapps . The directory structure of the application is  shown in Figure 18.1.   Figure 18.1. The application directory structure.      2.  Create a DSN name called Burnaby for the Microsoft Access database. Or, if you are   using a different database, make sure that the JDBC driver for the database can be found  and loaded by the JVM.   3.  Edit the server.xml file, which is the server configuration file located in the conf directory   under %CATALINA_HOME%. Open the file with your text editor and look for  something like the following:   <Context path=" examples" docBase="examples" debug="0"                    reloadable="true">   .   .   .       Right after the closing tag  , add this line:   <Context path=" burnaby" docBase="burnaby" debug="0"  reloadable="true">           Application Design   The application consists of a controller servlet that receives all the requests and forwards each  request to one of the JSP pages. The architecture is shown in Figure 18.2.   Figure 18.2. The application architecture.   Figures 18.3 to 18.8 show the user interface of the Burnaby project.      368                                                                                                                Team-FlyÂ®       Figure 18.3.

Building the Project      371      The following section discusses the files that make up the application, starting with the  deployment descriptor and continuing with the controller servlet. The section then discusses each  of the JSP pages and other classes in detail.   The Deployment Descriptor   One of the files included in the Burnaby directory is the deployment descriptor  web.xml . This  file can be found in the WEB-INF directory. In this web.xml file, you specify several initial  parameters that will become global variables in the servlet JSP pages. These global variables are  loaded into the ServletContext object when the servlet is initialized. The deployment descriptor is  given in Listing 18.1.   Listing 18.1 Web.xml File       <!DOCTYPE web-app     PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.

The URL of the controller servlet that will be used in the HREF attribute of a   hyperlink or the ACTION attribute of an HTML form in the JSP pages. For example, base  will have the following value if you are using Tomcat on the local machine on port 8080:   http:  localhost:8080 burnaby servlet ControllerServlet   When deploying the application, replace "localhost:8080" with your domain name.   jdbcDriver.

The Controller Servlet   Listing 18.2 ControllerServlet   The controller servlet is contained in the ControllerServlet.java file in the burnaby src directory  and is given in Listing 18.2.   import java.sql.*;   import javax.servlet.*;   import javax.servlet.http.*;   import java.io.*;   import java.util.*;   import com.brainysoftware.burnaby.DbBean;     public class ControllerServlet extends HttpServlet {       **Initialize global variables*      public void init ServletConfig config  throws ServletException {        System.out.println "initializing controller servlet." ;         ServletContext context = config.getServletContext  ;       context.setAttribute "base", config.getInitParameter "base"  ;       context.setAttribute "imageUrl",  config.getInitParameter "imageUrl"  ;            instantiating the DbBean       DbBean dbBean = new DbBean  ;          initialize the DbBean's fields       dbBean.setDbUrl config.getInitParameter "dbUrl"  ;       dbBean.setDbUserName config.getInitParameter "dbUserName"  ;       dbBean.setDbPassword config.getInitParameter "dbPassword"  ;            put the bean in the servlet context          the bean will be accessed from JSP pages       context.setAttribute "dbBean", dbBean ;         try {           loading the database JDBC driver         Class.forName config.getInitParameter "jdbcDriver"  ;       }         catch  ClassNotFoundException e  {        System.out.println e.toString   ;       }       373          super.init config ;     }          **Process the HTTP Get request*      public void doGet HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response  throws ServletException, IOException {      doPost request, response ;     }        **Process the HTTP Post request*      public void doPost HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response  throws ServletException, IOException {        String base = " jsp ";       String url = base + "Default.jsp";       String action = request.getParameter "action" ;         if  action != null  {        if  action.equals "search"             url = base + "SearchResults.jsp";         else if  action.equals "browseCatalog"             url = base + "BrowseCatalog.jsp";         else if  action.equals "productDetails"             url = base + "ProductDetails.jsp";         else if  action.equals "productDetails"             url = base + "ProductDetails.jsp";         else if  action.equals "addShoppingItem"             action.equals "updateShoppingItem"             action.equals "deleteShoppingItem"             action.equals "displayShoppingCart"             url = base + "ShoppingCart.jsp";         else if  action.equals "checkOut"             url = base + "CheckOut.jsp";         else if  action.equals "order"             url = base + "Order.jsp";       }       RequestDispatcher requestDispatcher =  getServletContext  .getRequestDispatcher url ;       requestDispatcher.forward request, response ;       }   }   As you can see from Listing 18.2, the two important methods are init and doPost. The init method  does the following things:      Reads initial parameters from the deployment descriptor and initializes global variables   for the whole application, as follows:   ServletContext context = config.getServletContext  ;   context.setAttribute "base",  config.getInitParameter "base"  ;    context.setAttribute "imageUrl",  config.getInitParameter "imageUrl"  ;   Instantiates the DbBean JavaBean and puts it in the servlet context object:      instantiating the DbBean       DbBean dbBean = new DbBean  ;          initialize the DbBean's fields       dbBean.setDbUrl config.getInitParameter "dbUrl"  ;                              374                        dbBean.setDbUserName config.getInitParameter "dbUserName"  ;   dbBean.setDbPassword config.getInitParameter "dbPassword"  ;                       put the bean in the servlet context          the bean will be accessed from JSP pages        context.setAttribute "dbBean", dbBean ;   This bean can be accessed from the JSP pages using the following useBean tag.   <jsp:useBean id="dbBean" scope="application"   class="com.brainysoftware.burnaby.DbBean" >      Loads the JDBC driver for the database, as follows:                     try {           loading the database JDBC driver         Class.forName config.getInitParameter "jdbcDriver"  ;       }       catch  ClassNotFoundException e  {        System.out.println e.toString   ;        }   The doPost method controls the application by forwarding requests to corresponding JSP pages  based on the value of the action parameter. Requests are forwarded to JSP pages using the forward  method of the RequestDispatcher object, as follows:   RequestDispatcher requestDispatcher =     getServletContext  .getRequestDispatcher url ;   requestDispatcher.forward request, response ;   Supporting Classes   Two supporting classes are used for this project. The first one is the Product class that represents a  product in the shopping application. The second one, the ShoppingItem class, represents a  shopping item. Both classes are similar except that the Product class does not have a quantity field.   The Product class and the ShoppingItem class are given in Listings 18.3 and 18.4, respectively.   Listing 18.3 Product.java   package com.brainysoftware.burnaby;     public class Product {    public int id;     public String name;     public String description;     public double price;   }   Listing 18.4 ShoppingItem.java   package com.brainysoftware.burnaby;     public class ShoppingItem {    public int productId;       375        public String name;     public String description;     public double price;     public int quantity;   }   Included Files   Every JSP page has the same designâthe header and the menu on the left of the page. The header  is represented by the Header.jsp file, and the menu by the Menu.jsp file. These files are given in  Listings 18.5 and 18.6, respectively.   Listing 18.5 Header.jsp   <%     String base =  String  application.getAttribute "base" ;     String imageUrl =  String  application.getAttribute "imageUrl" ;   %>   <TABLE WIDTH="740" CELLPADDING="0"       HEIGHT="75" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0">                  Burnaby e-Mall                     ?action=displayShoppingCart"><IMG         BORDER="0" SRC=" ">        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                 The first four lines of the code obtain the base and imageUrl attributes from the ServletContext  object, which in a JSP page is represented by the application implicit, as you see here:   <%     String base =  String  application.getAttribute "base" ;     String imageUrl =  String  application.getAttribute "imageUrl" ;   %>   The base and imageUrl variables are used to compose the link to the shopping cart, as follows:    ?action=displayShoppingCart"><IMG     BORDER="0" SRC=" ">    Listing 18.6 Menu.jsp       <jsp:useBean id="dbBean" scope="application"  class="com.brainysoftware.burnaby.DbBean" >   <%     String base =  String  application.getAttribute "base" ;   %>                      Search        376                                                                Categories:                     <%     Hashtable categories = dbBean.getCategories  ;     Enumeration categoryIds = categories.keys  ;     while  categoryIds.hasMoreElements    {      Object categoryId = categoryIds.nextElement  ;       out.println "<A HREF=" + base +  "?action=browseCatalog&categoryId=" + categoryId.toString   + ">" +         categories.get categoryId  +         "  " ;     }   %>                 The Menu.jsp page includes a form that allows the user to search for certain products. The form  also retrieves all records from the Categories table and displays them as clickable links to the  BrowseCatalog page. Retrieving the categories is done through a bean whose class is  com.brainysoftware.burnaby.DbBean. This bean has an application scope shown here:   <jsp:useBean id="dbBean" scope="application"     class="com.brainysoftware.burnaby.DbBean" >   The Default Page   The main page of this application is the Default.jsp page. Any request that does not carry an action  parameter or any request whose "action" parameter's value is invalid will be forwarded to this  page. This page simply displays a welcome message that is given in Listing 18.7.   Listing 18.7 Default.jsp            Welcome                                                         Welcome to Burnaby E-Mall.                377                      The SearchResults Page   The Menu.jsp page contains a search form and a number of hyperlinks to enable catalog browsing.  When submitted, the search form will be forwarded to the SearchResults.jsp page, presented in  Listing 18.8.   Listing 18.8 SearchResults.jsp               <jsp:useBean id="dbBean" scope="application"     class="com.brainysoftware.burnaby.DbBean" >   <%     String base =  String  application.getAttribute "base" ;   %>              Search Results                                                  <%     String keyword = request.getParameter "keyword" ;     if  keyword != null && !keyword.trim  .equals ""   {  %>                            Name               <FONT FACE="Verdana"  SIZE="3"> Description               Price               Details              <%       ArrayList products = dbBean.getSearchResults keyword ;       Iterator iterator = products.iterator  ;       while  iterator.hasNext    {        Product product =  Product  iterator.next  ;   %>                                <FONT FACE="Verdana"  SIZE="2">             <FONT FACE="Verdana"  SIZE="2">             <A   HREF=" ?action=productDetails&productId= ">            Details          378                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®                 <%       }     }     else       out.println "Please enter a search keyword." ;       %>                         Note that the search keyword is contained in the "keyword" parameter.   The BrowseCatalog Page   When the user clicks one of the category hyperlinks on the menu, all products in that category are  displayed by the BrowseCatalog.jsp page. This JSP page is similar to the SearchResults.jsp page,  except that it accepts a "categoryId" parameter instead of "keyword."   The BrowseCatalog.jsp page is given in Listing 18.9.   Listing 18.9 BrowseCatalog.jsp               <jsp:useBean id="dbBean" scope="application"  class="com.brainysoftware.burnaby.DbBean" >   <%     String base =  String  application.getAttribute "base" ;   %>            Browse Catalog                                                  <%     String categoryId = request.getParameter "categoryId" ;     if  categoryId != null && !categoryId.trim  .equals ""   {  %>                            Name             <FONT FACE="Verdana"  SIZE="3"> Description               Price               Details                  379      <%       ArrayList products = dbBean.getProductsInCategory categoryId ;       Iterator iterator = products.iterator  ;       while  iterator.hasNext    {        Product product =  Product  iterator.next  ;   %>                                <FONT FACE="Verdana"  SIZE="2">             <FONT FACE="Verdana"  SIZE="2">             <A   HREF=" ?action=productDetails&productId= ">            Details              <%       }     }     else       out.println "Invalid category." ;   %>                         The ProductDetails Page   From the SearchResults page or the BrowseCatalog page, the user can click the Details hyperlink  to display a product's details. A product's details are processed by the ProductDetails.jsp page, and  from this page, the user can click the Add to Cart link to add the product to the shopping cart. The  ProductDetails.jsp page is given in Listing 18.10.

Each shopping item is represented by the  ShoppingItem class and stored in a Hashtable object called shoppingCart. This Hashtable object is  stored in the Session object of each particular user.   The ShoppingCart.jsp is given in Listing 18.11.

This is done by confirming the  purchase and filling in an HTML form in the CheckOut.jsp page. The Checkout page is given in  Listing 18.12 and is basically a very simple HTML form on which users fill in the delivery and  credit card details.   Listing 18.12 CheckOut.jsp   <%     String base =  String  application.getAttribute "base" ;   %>            Check Out                                                                                           Delivery Details                             Contact Name:                                       Delivery Address:                                        Credit Card Details                             Name on Credit Card:                                      Credit Card Number:                                       Credit Card Expiry Date:                                      &nbsp;                                                          384              The Order Page   When the user submits the form on the CheckOut page, the request will go to the Order page. This  page inserts a record into the Orders table and inserts each shopping item into the OrderDetails  table. The Order.jsp page is presented in Listing 18.13.

Its sole purpose was to demonstrate how Model 2 applications can be designed and developed.   In the next chapter, "XML-Based E-Books," you take a look at another web project.      388                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       Chapter 19. XML-Based E-Books   Because the Internet is getting more popular every day, more content is available online. Some  content is simple HTML, but some is structured to resemble books. The latter includes online  manuals, electronic books, and more.   An electronic book, also called an e-book, is not much different from a printed book in that it has a  table of contents and a number of chapters. Because an electronic book is online, however, the  publisher can take advantage of many features that are not available in printed books. For example,  you can make an electronic book easy to navigate by displaying the table of contents all the time.  When readers want to change chapters, they can do it straight away by clicking the link to that  chapter.   The format you choose for an electronic book is an important decision. The most popular format  makes the electronic content viewable in a web browser window. In this type of project, the table  of contents is displayed in an HTML frame on the left, as shown in Figure 19.1. The frame on the  right displays in HTML format the content of the selected chapter or chapter heading.   Figure 19.1. The visual representation of the book structure.      Compared to a paper book, an e-book gives you advantages beyond being easier to navigate. First,  you can make your e-book available to an unlimited number of people by putting it on the Internet.  Second, you can update your electronic book at almost any time. No printing cost is incurred when  you issue the next edition of your book. The main disadvantage is that your readers need an  Internet connection every time they want to read the book. Because access to the Internet is  becoming more commonplace, however, this disadvantage is arguable. Also debatable is whether  it is more convenient to read a non-electronic book.   This chapter discusses the many aspects of publishing an electronic book. Of utmost importance is  the table of contents, which gets the first priority in this discussion. Then you see how to      389      implement an easy-to-navigate browser-independent electronic book. The two parts to this project  are the client side and the server side. Finally, you explore a project implemented using  JavaServer pages. The same project can be implemented using any Internet technology, however,  after you understand the concept.       The Table of Contents   The first issue in the electronic book system is to decide how you are going to store the book's  table of contents; that is, the structure of chapters and headings. A book can have any number of  chapters, and each chapter can have any number of headings. These headings, in turn, can have  subheadings with sub-subheadings, and so on. In other words, a book's table of content, can be  viewed as a tree of chapters headings. It is hierarchical.   Having said that, you need a format in which you can easily work with hierarchical data. XML is  probably the first and best choice available today. XML is widely accepted, and editing is easy  because XML is essentially plain text. By storing your book structure in an XML document, you  need only to edit the XML document when the book structure changes.   For example, the table of contents of the online book shown in Figure 19.1 is given in Listing 19.1.   Listing 19.1 A Book's Table of Contents in XML                                                                                                                                           As you can see, the table of contents has the   tag as the root. Because of the difficulty in  naming the multiple elements, this example calls the section under chapters "heading." Therefore,  instead of subchapter, you call it heading1. Instead of sub-subchapter, you have heading2. A  heading2 can have a subheading called heading3, heading3 can have a subheading called heading4,  and so on.       Translating XML into the Object Tree      390      Note   Having a very structured book content in an XML format is one thing; making it viewable by your  reader is another. To make sure that your book can be used on as many browsers as possible, you  should use JavaScript to make it browser-independent.   Chapter 26, "Working with Object Trees," gives you the background to understand how  to implement an object tree in JavaScript.   Because changing the appearance of the JavaScript object tree involves clearing and writing to a  document object, working with frames is much easier. The frameset, which is the main document  that the user requests, contains all the JavaScript code and two frames. The left frame displays the  structure of the book. The right frame displays the selected HTML page.   As mentioned in Chapter 26, a JavaScript object tree is a hierarchical structure with objects and  parent-child relationships between objects. Each object is a separate entity made from a JavaScript  array. To create this object tree, you need two custom JavaScript functions: createObject and  append. You use the createObject function to create an object in the object tree and the append  function to create a relationship between two objects.   An object in the tree represents the book, a chapter, or a heading. Note that by heading I mean any  heading: heading1, heading2, â¦ or headingn. Each object has a unique identifier that is used to  search for this object, a title to display, and a URL to the HTML content that is the object's content.  In addition to these three elements, an object also has a state: whether it is open or closed. An  open object displays all its children, if any. A closed object that has children displays a plus sign   +  at its node. To open this object, you click this node  plus sign . An open object has a minus  sign  -  at its node. To close this object, you click the minus sign. In more technical terms, opening  and closing an object is also called expanding or collapsing the object.   To create an object, you call the createObject function, passing a unique identifier, a title, and the  URL to the content. This function is given in Listing 19.2.   Listing 19.2 The createObject Function   function createObject id, title, url  {    var element = new Array  ;     element[0] = id;     element[1] = title;     element[2] = url;     element[3] = 0;     return element;   }   For example, to create the object that represents the book, you write the following line:   var e1 = createObject 1, "Fantasies for Dummies",  "bookTitle.html" ;   This code creates an object with identifier 1, title "Fantasies for Dummies," and "bookTitle.html"  as the URL. Remember that an object in JavaScript is merely an array. The identifier is stored as  the first array element, the title as the second, the URL as the third. The fourth element   element[3]  stores the object state. 0 indicates that the object is closed. 1 indicates the object is  open. By default, an object is created closed.   To create a relationship between two objects, you use the append function, as shown in Listing  19.3. The function accepts two arguments: the object to be the parent in the relationship and the  object that is intended to be the child in the relationship.      391      Listing 19.3 The append Function   function append parent, child  {    parent[parent.length] = child;   }   To create the XML document in Listing 19.1, you need to call the createObject and append  functions repeatedly to make the whole object tree. The code part is given in Listing 19.4.   Listing 19.4 Creating a JavaScript Object Tree Based on the Structure in Listing  19.1   var e1 = createObject 1, "Fantasies for Dummies",  "bookTitle.html" ;   var e2 = createObject 2, "Introduction to Disneyland", "ch1.html" ;   append e1 , e2 ;   var e3 = createObject 3, "Meet Mickey", "mickey.html" ;   append e2 , e3 ;   var e4 = createObject 4, "Going Inside", "ch2.html" ;   append e1 , e4 ;   var e5 = createObject 5, "Meet Donald", "donald.html" ;   append e4 , e5 ;   var e6 = createObject 6, "Kwik", "kwik.html" ;   append e5 , e6 ;   var e7 = createObject 7, "You can't escape", "noEscape.html" ;   append e6 , e7 ;   var e8 = createObject 8, "Kwek", "kwek.html" ;   append e5 , e8 ;   var e9 = createObject 9, "Kwak", "kwak.html" ;   append e5 , e9 ;   var e10 = createObject 10, "Alice in Disneyland", "Ch3.html" ;   append e1 , e10 ;   Note that each object is given a unique identifier.   The challenge in creating a JavaScript object tree based on an XML document is resolving how to  translate the XML document in Listing 19.1 into JavaScript code in Listing 19.4. When the table  of contents changes, the XML document also changes. This change must be reflected by the  JavaScript objects and relationships between objects in Listing 19.4. This is the reason you need  the server-side processing to read the XML file every time the electronic book is requested:You  need to ensure that the table of contents the user sees is current.       The Project   In this implementation, the complete project consists of two files: index.jsp and TocBean.java.  You also need HTML files for the contents, of course; but those static files are outside this  discussion.   In addition to these two files, you need two other dummy files called toc.html and content.html,  because a frameset must have physical pages to fill the frames.   The index.jsp file is the main file that contains the JavaScript functions for creating and  manipulating the object tree. Its code is given in Listing 19.5.      392      Listing 19.5 The index.jsp File                Table of Contents        <!ââ  Hiding Script     var selectedElementId = 1;   var root;     function createObject id, title, url  {    var element = new Array  ;     element[0] = id;     element[1] = title;     element[2] = url;     element[3] = 0;     return element;   }     function append parent, child  {    parent[parent.length] = child;   }   function redrawTree   {    var doc = top.treeFrame.window.document;     doc.clear  ;     doc.write "   \n" +       ".normal:link { text-decoration:none; color:black; font- family:verdana; font-size: 8pt; }\n" +       ".selected:link { text-decoration:none; color:red; font- family:verdana; font-size: 9pt; }\n" +       "  " ;       doc.write " " ;     redrawNode root, doc, 0, 1, "" ;     doc.write "  " ;     doc.close  ;   }     function closeBook   {    root[3] = 0;     redrawTree  ;   }     function openBook   {    root[3] = 1;     redrawTree  ;   }     function redrawNode     foldersNode, doc, level, lastNode, leftSide  {    var j=0;     var i=0;     var id = foldersNode[0];     var title = foldersNode[1];     var url = foldersNode[2];     var hasSubNode =  foldersNode.length>4 ;     var expanded = foldersNode[3];           393        doc.write "<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0" +       " CELLPADDING=0>" ;     doc.write "  " ;     doc.write leftSide ;       if  id == 1  {    this is the book       if  root[3] == 0          doc.write "  <IMG  SRC=images ClosedBook.gif   BORDER=0> " ;       else         doc.write "  <IMG  SRC=images OpenBook.gif BORDER=0> " ;    }       var nodeLink =       " ";       if  level>0        if  lastNode  {   the last folder in array         if  hasSubNode  {          if  expanded              doc.write nodeLink +   "<IMG SRC='images LastNodeMinus.gif'" +   " BORDER=0 WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=22>" + " " ;           else             doc.write nodeLink +   "<IMG SRC='images LastNodePlus.gif'" +   " BORDER=0 WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=22>" + " " ;         }         else           doc.write "<IMG SRC='images LastNode.gif'" +             " WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=22>" ;             leftSide += "<IMG SRC='images blank.gif'" +             " WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=22>";       }       else {   not last folder         if  hasSubNode  {          if  expanded              doc.write nodeLink +   "<IMG SRC='images NodeMinus.gif'" +   " BORDER=0 WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=22>" + " " ;           else             doc.write nodeLink +               "<IMG SRC='images NodePlus.gif'" +               " BORDER=0 WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=22> " ;         }         else           doc.write "<IMG SRC='images Node.gif'" +             " WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=22>" ;         leftSide += "<IMG SRC='images VertLine.gif'" +           " WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=22>";       }         doc.write " &nbsp;" ;           if  id == selectedElementId          doc.write "<A CLASS=selected" ;       else         doc.write "<A CLASS=normal" ;       394        doc.write " HREF='javascript:top.clickElement "       + id + ", \"" + url + "\" '>" + title + " " ;       doc.write " "        if  hasSubNode && expanded  {      level++;       for  i=4; i<foldersNode.length;i++          if  i == foldersNode.length-1          redrawNode             foldersNode[i], doc, level, 1, leftSide ;         else           redrawNode             foldersNode[i], doc, level, 0, leftSide ;     }   }     function clickElement id, url  {    selectedElementId = id;     redrawTree  ;     parent.frames[1].location = url;   }     function toggleNode foldersNode, folderId  {    if  foldersNode[0] == folderId        foldersNode[3] = 1 - foldersNode[3];     else if  foldersNode[3]        for  var i=4; i< foldersNode.length; i++          toggleNode foldersNode[i], folderId ;   }       function clickNode folderId  {    toggleNode root, folderId ;     redrawTree  ;   }     function initialize   {    root = e1;     redrawTree  ;   }   <%     TocBeanId.getToc "toc.xml" ;     out.println TocBeanId.getString   ;   %>        end hiding script  ââ>                                               Unfortunately, your browser cannot render frames.

Please upgrade your browser.                     As you can see from the bottom part of Listing 19.5, the index.jsp file hosts two frames: toc.html  and content.html. The first frame is named treeFrame and the second frame objectFrame, as  follows:                                   Unfortunately, your browser cannot render frames.       Please upgrade your browser.                   The treeFrame frame is where you display the structure of you book. The objectFrame frame, on  the other hand, displays the content of the selected page. For example, if the user clicks the first  chapter title, the content of Chapter 1 is displayed  refer to Figure 19.1    The index.jsp file also contains the following JavaScript functions:   createObject. As given in Listing 19.3, this function creates an array object with four elements.  Each element has a unique identifier.   append. Creates a parent-child relationship between two objects.   redrawTree. This function is responsible for clearing the treeFrame document and writing new  content to it when the user interacts with the object tree. From the frameset  index.jsp , the  document of the treeFrame frame is referred to as treeFrame.window.document. Because this  function will be invoked from the treeFrame page, however, the document is referred to as the  following:   var doc = top.treeFrame.window.document;   Therefore, the variable doc here refers to the document object of the treeFrame frame.      399      The redrawTree function first clears the document and writes some static HTML to doc, as  follows:   doc.clear  ;   doc.write "   \n" +     ".normal:link { text-decoration:none; color:black; " +     "font-family:verdana; font-size: 8pt; }\n" +     ".selected:link { text-decoration:none; color:red; " +     "font-family:verdana; font-size: 9pt; }\n" +     "  " ;   doc.write " " ;   Then it calls the redrawNode function, passing the variable root and doc:   redrawNode root, doc, 0, 1, "" ;   Then it outputs the closing   and   tags to doc:   doc.write "  " ;   Finally, it closes the document:   doc.close  ;   function closeBook   {    root[3] = 0;     redrawTree  ;   }   function openBook   {    root[3] = 1;     redrawTree  ;   }   redrawNode. This is a recursive function that actually redraws the book structure.   closeBook. Changes the root object to the collapsed state, as follows:   openBook. Changes the root object to the expanded state, as you see here:   clickElement. The clickElement function is invoked when the user clicks an element in the object  tree. It accepts two arguments: id and url. When the user clicks an element, the element with its  identifier id becomes the selected element.   The selected element is drawn with a different color, which means that because the tree has a new  selected element, the tree must be redrawn using the following:   redrawTree  ;   The last thing this function does is change the content of the second frame using  frames[1].location = url. However, because the clickElement function is invoked from the  treeFrame frame, the correct code is as follows:   parent.frames[1].location = url;   Note that url is the second argument passed to the function.      400      clickNode. This function is invoked when the user clicks a node. This function calls the  toggleNode function and the redrawTree function:   toggleNode root, folderId ;   redrawTree  ;   toggleNode. Toggles the clicked node from the expanded state to the collapsed state and vice  versa. To do this, the function must first search for the node with the correct identifier. When it is  found, the function changes the fourth array element of the object from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0, as you see  here:   if  foldersNode[0] == folderId      foldersNode[3] = 1 - foldersNode[3];   If the current node is not the clicked node, the function continues searching by recursively calling  itself:   else if  foldersNode[3]      for  var i=4; i< foldersNode.length; i++        toggleNode foldersNode[i], folderId ;   The index.jsp also contains the following code that uses the TocBean.java bean:   <%     TocBeanId.getToc "toc.xml" ;     out.println TocBeanId.getString   ;   %>   These two lines uses the JavaBean that translates the table of contents in XML  as shown in  Listing 19.1  into the JavaScript object tree  as shown in Listing 19.4 .   TocBean.java   As previously mentioned, you need server-side code to translate the XML document containing  the table of contents into the JavaScript code like the one in Listing 19.4. The TocBean.java bean  is the one responsible for it. The code is given in Listing 19.6.   First, you need a Java XML parser. Here I use the one from Sun, downloadable from  http:  java.sun.com xml index.html. If you choose to use another parser from another vendor,  however, you should still be able to use the code without any modification other than the import  statement in Listing 19.6.

You then can read this output using the getString method  and send it to the web browser.   The getToc and getChildNode methods are explained in the following sections.   The getToc method accepts one argument: the filename of the XML document containing the  book's table of contents. The method retrieves the root object  the   tag  as the first object  with identifier 1 and appends this information to the output StringBuffer. Using the XML  document in Listing 19.1, the output should be the following:   var e1 = createObject 1, "Fantasies for Dummies",  "bookTitle.html" ;   The method then calls the getChildNode method to process the rest of the tags. Note that objectId  is used to register the object identifier.   getChildNode     This method reads a tag whose name starts with "chapter" or "heading." The tag found is  appended to the output StringBuffer.       Pre-Render the Table of Contents   Every time someone reads your electronic book, the XML document containing the table of  contents must be parsed into the HTML JavaScript equivalent of the hierarchical structure. This  takes more time than simply sending a static page to the browser. Because the table of contents  most likely does not change every day, you can pre-render the table of contents for a busy site so  that it is available as a static page. For this purpose, you can use the output caching technique  explained in Chapter 15, "Caching."       Summary   In this chapter, you learned how to create an electronic book application whose table of content is  based on an XML document. When the structure changes, you need to update only the XML  document.      403      Chapter 20.

Some people  simply put the file in one of the virtual host's sub-directories and provide no link to it, so that only  those who know the full path can download it. This method is of course, only as secure as the full  path to the document, and you probably would not secure your corporate confidential documents  this way.   What people normally do is to utilize the web server and operating system authentication method  so that every time someone tries to download a file, that person needs to type in the correct user  name and password. This is a good approach, but it is too simple in many circumstances. One  problem with this solution is that you need to tell the password to everyone you want to be able to  download the file. This approach is like sharing the same NT or UNIX user name and password  with everyone in the corporationâit doesn't work. People don't share passwords for the same  reasons they don't share secrets. In addition to the privacy and security issues, this approach is less  than suitable when you want more functionality, such as document versioning and full activity  records, without relying on the web server log files.   Another solution is to store the files in a database and allow access to them only after  authenticating the user. Putting Binary Large Object Blocks  BLOBs  in the database is  excruciatingly slow and resource-hungry, however. The better solution is to store those files in a  directory outside the virtual host  virtual directory  so they are not visible from the  Internet intranet when the user types a URL. To download a file, the user has to direct the browser  to a special page and type the user name and password. Upon successful authentication, the web  server fetches the file and sends it to the browser.   This chapter introduces the concept of document management, an important topic not often  discussed in beginner or advanced Java or web programming books. The discussion presented in  this chapter is based on docman, the commercial web-based document management project from  Brainysoftware.com. Not all of its features are included in here, though, because of space  limitations. The complete project may take a book of its own.   The basic concepts of this project are revealed in this chapter. By understanding these concepts,  you easily can extend the functionality according to your needs. The four key features discussed in  this chapter are these:      Database structure of the project.     Programmable file download.     File upload.     The client-side tool that makes navigating through the document as easy as using   Windows Explorer. In fact, the user interface will look very familiar to any Windows user.   Programmable file download and file upload are discussed in Chapter 12, "Programmable  File Download," and Chapter 13, "File Upload" and will not be repeated here. If you  would like to understand this project fully, you should first read those two chapters. Also  important to understanding how the navigation tool works is Chapter 26, "Working with  Object Trees."   Note           404      The Docman Project   In brief, docman is a Windows Explorer on the web. This Internet application is implemented  using Java Server Pages technology to present a web-based hierarchical file system similar to  those in a non-web environment. There are two types of objects: files and folders directories. A  file is any document you store in the file system. A folder or directory is a container that can store  any number of files and any number of other folders. If Folder B is located under Folder A, Folder  B is said to be a subfolder of Folder A. Folder A is referred to as the parent folder of Folder B and  any file Folder A contains. The topmost folder in the hierarchy is called root. It is the first folder  that users see when they browse the system. As you would expect, root does not have a parent  folder.   Docman supports any number of users. Users each have their own permission set. This means you  can allow users to view files in one directory but not in the other. This is naturally useful in an  organization with different depart-ments. For example, the marketing people can see the  documents belonging to the marketing department but not IT-related files. Those working in the  IT department, on the other hand, have access to these IT-related documents, but not to the HR's  remuneration archive. Users can browse the system from root down the hierarchy as long as they  have the permission.   Figure 20.1 shows the user interface of docman. Notice the familiar object tree on the left side.   Figure 20.1. The docman project's user interface.   System Requirements   The docman project relies on the two JavaBeans included on the accompanying CD:      The BrainySoftware.com File Download bean for programmable file download     The BrainySoftware.com File Upload bean version 2.0 for uploading files         405      Using these two beans will save you writing hundreds of lines of Java code and make your code  look neater.   Before you start, you need to copy the .jar files in the software  FileDownloadBean and  software FileUploadBean directories into your WEB-INF lib directory of your application  directory and restart Tomcat. Please also look at the license agreement of the two beans. If you  choose to write your own beans, Chapters 12 and 13 should give you sufficient information to do  so.   The following section discusses the database structure and all the JSP pages and bean comprising  the project. The whole project is ready for deployment and can be found in the software docman  directory on the accompanying CD.   The Database Structure   In this implementation, file or folder information is stored in a relational database. However, all  files are stored in one single folder outside the virtual root or virtual directory, regardless of their  position in the hierarchy. This may sound strange at first but will seem logical after you read the  next section.   The way in which files are stored doesn't matter as long as they are not directly accessible to users  who type a URL in the web browser and the information on the file system structure remains  intact. In this implementation, each object  file or folder  has the following properties:   Id. A unique object identifier         Parent Id. The identifier of the parent folder.     Type. The object type, whether it is a folder or a file. A folder has a type of 0 and a file of   1.      Name. The name of the object. In other words, either a filename or a folder name.   Of special interest is the record that has an object Id of 1 and is called root. root is the first object  in the system and has a parent Id of 0, which means it does not have a parent.   Object-related information is stored in a table called Objects. As you can see, the object Id and the  parent Id of each object gives you enough information to know the hierarchical structure of all  folders and files   The structure of the Objects table in the Access database is given in Table 20.1.   Table 20.1. The Structure of the Objects Table   Field Name   Data Type   ID  ParentID  Type  Name   Note   Number  Number  Number  Text   You also can use your favorite database server to create these tables. One thing to note,  though; your database server must support subqueries because they are used in the SQL  statements used to access the database. Most popular database servers, such as Microsoft  SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase, and IBM's DB2, support subqueries.      406      ID  UserName  Password   UserId  ObjectId   This implementation also uses two other tables: Users and Permissions. The Users table stores  information about users, and the Permissions table stores information about which users have  permission to various files or folders. The structures of these two tables in an Access database are  given in Table 20.2 and Table 20.3.   Table 20.2. The Structure of the Users Table   Field Name   Data Type   Table 20.3. The Structure of the Permissions Table  Field Name  Data Type   Number  Text  Text   Number  Number   The Permissions table is very important in the docman project. If a user has permission to an  object, this information must be present in the Permissions table. Therefore, if user A, whose user  ID is 7, has permission to access a folder whose object ID is 133, there must be a record in the  Permissions table with UserID 7 and ObjectID 133.   Now that you understand the database structure, let's work on an example: the directory structure  of a fictitious company called Door Never Closed Pty, Ltd. The file and folder collection in this  example is small for the sake of simplicity, but the hierarchy should reflect that of a real system.  The hierarchy of all the folders and files is shown in Figure 20.2.   Figure 20.2. The directory structure of the file system.      Under root, you see two directories: Marketing and Sales. There is also a README.TXT for  everyone new to read.  This file contains instructions from the system administrator on how to use  the system . The people in the Marketing department store their folders and files in the Marketing  folder. Access to this folder is limited to the Marketing people only. The Sales folder is for the  Sales department, and only the employees working in the Sales department can access it.   The content of the Objects table looks like Table 20.4.   ID   1   0      Table 20.4. The Data in the Objects Table   ParentID   Type   Name   0   root   407      2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11   1  2   1  1  2  3  4  4  5  6  7   1  2  1  1  2  6  6  5  5  5   Note   0  1  1  0  0  1  1  1  1  1   Marketing  Strategy.doc  README.TXT  Sales  Managers  evaluation.doc  remuneration.doc  europe.doc  asia.doc  america.doc   The ID is assigned to an object at the time of the file upload, which means that there is no  guarantee that files in a folder will have consecutive object IDs. This doesn't matter,  however, because object IDs and other metadata are invisible to the user. All users see is  a hierarchical file system.   Note also that files are stored in one single directory using their object Ids. This means  that the Strategy.doc file is stored as 3. Because all files are given unique numbers as  names, you can have two or more files with the same filename. When a file is sent as an  attachment, the system will translate the object ID into the original filename.   Again, for simplicity, this example includes only two users: one with the login name boni, and the  other with the login name bulbul. The content of the Users table looks like that shown in Table  20.5.   Table 20.5. The Data in the Users Table   ID   UserName   Password   boni  bulbul   secret  brownhair   Now comes the tricky partâthe permission set. Boni is the marketing manager. She definitely has  access to the Marketing department's files but has nothing to do with the Sales department. Bulbul,  on the other hand, is the National Sales Director of Door Never Closed Pty, Ltd. He has access to  all Sales department's files, but Marketing is not his territory. The README.TXT is for everyone,  so both Boni and Bulbul have access to it. This description is reflected in the Permissions table  shown in Table 20.6.   Table 20.6. The Permissions Table   ObjectID   UserID   1  2  1  1  1  2  2  1  1      408                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       8  9  10  11   The Code   1  2  2  2   After the database is in place, the coding part comes easy. In fact, with a complete system like this,  you need only three files and one bean for database and object manipulation. The three files are as  follows:      Login.html. A simple HTML file for users to type in their user name and password.     DisplayObjects.jsp. A jsp file that displays all objects in a particular folder. This file also   contains the form to upload a file into a folder.      DownloadObject.jsp. A jsp file that fetches a file and sends it to the browser as an   attachment.   The DBBean Bean   The DBBean bean does most of the work. You use it to connect to the database, get all objects in a  particular folder, and get a filename for download. Of particular importance are the two connect  methods. The first method is the one that receives three parameters: url, userName, and password.  The url is your JDBC URL, whereas userName and password are the connection details that you  need to get access to the database. You use only one user name and one password for getting a  database connection. This user name and password pair is used by the system only and is referred  to in the bean as dbUserName and dbPassword. All application end users know nothing about this.  Don't confuse them with the user name and password that belong to a user. The latter are used to  get access to a particular object in the database tables.   The second connect method accepts no parameter. You use this when you want to use the default  values in the bean or you have passed those three arguments in previous statements  you set the  url, dbUserName, and dbPassword using the setDbUrl, setDbUserName, and setDbPassword  methods, respectively . There is another database-related method: setJDBCDriverName. You call  this method if your driver name is that other than "sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver".   This example uses the JDBC-ODBC driver to access a Microsoft Access database on a Windows  system. You must create a Data Source Name  DSN  called docman for the application to work.  The choice of database is your decision. You need only to make sure that you use the correct  JDBC driver. Because of the SQL statements used, as stated earlier, your database must support  sub-queries.   The following is the code for the connect methods:   try {    Class.forName  JDBCDriverName  ;     connection = DriverManager.getConnection url,       userName, password ;   }   catch  Exception e  {}   Note   The code for the connect methods could be different, depending on your database JDBC  driver. Refer to your JDBC driver documentation for details.      409      The DBBean also has a static final String called DATA_PATH that contains the physical path to a  special directory that will host all the uploaded files. You can change the value of this string to  any directory you want to use. For security purposes, however, make sure the directory is outside  your application directory.   The other methods used in the bean are listed in the following sections.   verifyUser String userName, String password    Use this method to verify that the user is authorized. This method checks the Users table for the  UserName userName and Password password. The method returns true if it can find the user name  and password in the table; otherwise, it returns false  not an authorized user . The SQL statement  used is this:   SELECT ID FROM Users   WHERE UserName=userName AND Password = password   getDataPath     This method returns the physical directory on the server where you store all the files. You use this  method when downloading or uploading a file. The data path must be set to a directory outside the  virtual host.   getFolderName String id, String userName, String password    You call this method in the DisplayObjects.jsp to get the folder name of the current folder. You  need this information because you need to display the folder name to make users aware of their  position in the hierarchy tree. You might think that you could easily get the folder name and  parent ID by using the following SQL statement:   SELECT Name, ParentID FROM Objects WHERE ID=id   However, you want to make sure that only users with sufficient permission can get information  about specific folders. Therefore, you use the following more complex SQL statement instead:   This method returns the object ID of the parent folder for the current folder. The SQL statement  that retrieves a ParentID only if the user has permission to view the parent object is as follows:   SELECT O.Name, O.ParentID   FROM Objects O, Permissions P, Users U   WHERE O.ID = id   AND O.ID = P.ObjectID   AND P.UserID = U.ID   AND U.UserName = userName   AND U.Password = password   getParentId     SELECT O.ParentID   FROM Objects O, Users U, Permissions P   WHERE O.ID=objectID   AND O.ParentID = P.ObjectID   AND P.UserID = U.ID   AND U.UserName = userName   AND U.Password = password      410      getChildObjects String parentId, String userName, String password    This method returns an ArrayList containing all child objects in the current folder. You will need  the ID, Type, and Name of each object. These three fields are joined together into a string and  each field is separated by a comma. Again, instead of using the following SQL statement:   SELECT ID, Type, Name   FROM Objects   WHERE ParentID = id   Use the more "secure" SQL statement:   SELECT ID, Type, Name   FROM Objects   WHERE ParentID =      SELECT ObjectID FROM Permissions     WHERE ObjectID = id     AND UserID =        SELECT ID FROM Users       WHERE UserName = userName       AND Password = password                 ORDER BY Type ASC   SELECT Name   FROM Objects   WHERE ID =      SELECT ObjectID FROM Permissions     WHERE ObjectID = objectId      AND UserID =         SELECT ID FROM Users        WHERE UserName = userName        AND Password = password                   The ORDER BY clause is there to guarantee that all folders  Type=0  will appear first.   getFilename String objectId, String userName, String password    This method is used to get the filename of the file object the user requests to download. The  following SQL statement is used to guarantee that only users who have permission to access this  file can download it:   getCookie javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest request, String cookie    This method returns the value of a cookie if the cookie is found in the HTTP request; otherwise, it  returns null. Finding a cookie is done by looping the Cookie array of the HTTP request,  comparing the cookie sought and the name of each cookie in the array, as follows:   Cookie cookies[] = request.getCookies  ;   if  cookies != null      for  int i=0; i<cookies.length; ++i        if  cookies[i].getName  .equals cookie           return cookies[i].getValue  ;      411      Note   The complete code for the DBBean method is given later in this chapter in Listing 20.2.  Some methods not described here will also be explained later.   hasUploadPermission String id, String userName, String password    This method is called when the user tries to upload a file. It returns true if the user can upload a  file into a directory whose identifier is specified as the id argument.   synchronized public int getLastObjectId     This method returns the last object identifier in the Objects table. The output of this method plus  one is the identifier for the next object to be uploaded.   insertObject String parentId, String objectId, String filename    This method inserts a row into the Tables object and is called when uploading a file.   insertPermissions String parentId, String objectId    This method inserts a row in the Permissions table for a given object and the user who uploads the  file.   The complete code of the DBBean class is given in Listing 20.1.

Login.html, the first page in the application, is a simple HTML file with a form whose ACTION  attribute is set to "DisplayObjects.jsp". The HTML code is given in Listing 20.2 and the page is  shown in Figure 20.3.   Figure 20.3. The Login page.      417         Listing 20.2 Login.html            Login Page               Door Never Closed Pty Ltd                   User Name                         Password                                                            DisplayObjects.jsp   After the user types the user name and password and presses the Submit button in Login.html, the  HTTP request is processed by the DisplayObjects.jsp page. The page first checks the validation of      418                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       the user name and password. If the user name and password are not valid, the user is redirected  back to the Login page. If the entries are valid, the page tries to display the objects.   Cookies are used so that the user needs to log in only once. After a successful login happens, the  user name and password are sent to the browser as cookies. These cookies will be sent back to the  server on the next HTTP request. The cookies live until the user closes the browser.   The code for DisplayObjects.jsp is given in Listing 20.3.

It  will first try to find the request parameters "userName" and "password".      421      String userName = request.getParameter "userName" ;   String password = request.getParameter "password" ;   This assumes that the request is from the Login page. The DisplayObjects.jsp page can also be  called from within itself, however. If this is the case, the request parameters "userName" and  "password" aren't used, but there must be cookies by the same names, which means the code needs  to check for the cookies in the HTTP request:   if  userName == null  password == null  {       either userName or password is not found,        the request is not from the Login page,        check cookies     userName =       DBBeanId.getCookie request, "userName" ;     password =       DBBeanId.getCookie request, "password" ;   }   If the cookies are not found, the HTTP request could be coming from someone who is trying to  bypass the Login page, or it could be that the browser is not supporting cookies. In either case, the  user is redirected to the Login page.   If user name and password entries are found, either as request parameters or as cookies, you can't  assume that the request is coming from an authorized user. You still need to verify the user name  and password against the database each time this page is requested. If verification fails, the page  sends the user back to the Login page. If it is successful, the code creates the "userName" and  "password" cookies so that future requests from the user in the session will be successful. This is  done in the following snippet:   if  !DBBeanId.verifyUser userName, password       response.sendRedirect "Login.html" ;   else {        authorized user, create cookies here       Cookie cookieUserName =         new Cookie "userName", userName ;       Cookie cookiePassword =         new Cookie "password", password ;       response.addCookie cookieUserName ;       response.addCookie cookiePassword ;   }   Every HTTP request for this page should bring with it the folder ID of the folder whose child  objects are to be displayed. An exception to this is when the user first logs in. In this case, folder  ID 1  root  is implied and the atRoot flag is set. The code is given here:   String id = request.getParameter "id" ;   boolean atRoot = false;     if  id == null      id = "1";     1 is the root     if  id.equals "1"       atRoot = true;   if  !atRoot  {      422  If the current folder is not the root, the folder must have a parent folder. The following code  creates the link that the user can click to go back to the parent folder:            display the link to go up one level.        this link calls this same page,        passing the parent id     parentId = DBBeanId.getParentId id, userName,       password ;     out.println "<A HREF=\"DisplayObjects.jsp?id="       + parentId + "\">"       + "<IMG SRC=\"images Up.gif\" "       + "BORDER=\"0\">  " ;   }   Note that this code uses the getParentID method of the DBBean to get the parent ID of the current  folder. This parent ID will then be fed as the value for the ID parameter of the DisplayObjects.jsp  page. This shows the recursive nature of this page.   To give users indication of their position in the hierarchy, you display the folder name here.  Notice that if an unauthorized user tries to bypass the Login page, the getFolderName method will  return null:   String currentFolderName =     DBBeanId.getFolderName id, userName, password ;   if  currentFolderName == null      out.println " You don't have permission to"       + " view this folder. " ;   else {    out.println " Current Folder: "       + currentFolderName + " " ;   Now comes the main method that actually retrieves all the child objects of the current folder. The  getChildObjects method of the DBBean returns an ArrayList. Again, only authorized users can  view this:   ArrayList records =     DBBeanId.getChildObjects id, userName, password ;   Each item in the records ArrayList is a String containing the Object ID, Type, and Name of the  child object separated by commas. Therefore, you need a StringTokenizer to get each field. The  following code loops through the records ArrayList and gets the values of Object ID, Type, and  Name of each object:   for  int i=0; i<records.size  ; i++  {    String row =  String  records.get i ;     StringTokenizer st =       new StringTokenizer row, "," ;     String objectId =  String  st.nextElement  ;     String type =  String  st.nextElement  ;     String name =  String  st.nextElement  ;     String imagePath;     String objectLink;     String objectType;     .     .     .   }   If you want to give users a descriptive visual interface, use different icons to represent files and  folders. To be precise, for each folder, use the Folder.gif image, and for each file, use the File.gif  image. The other difference is the destination links of each type. When the user clicks on a folder,      423      the application will display all the child objects of that folder that the user has permission to view.  This will call the DisplayObjects.jsp. When the user clicks on a file, however, the application will  send the file as an attachment to the browser if the user has permission to view that file. This is  depicted in the following code:     if  type.equals "0"   {    folder       imagePath =   " ";       objectLink =         "<A HREF=\"DisplayObjects.jsp?id=" +         objectId + "\">";       objectType = "Folder";     }     else {   file       imagePath =   " ";       objectLink =         "<A HREF=\"DownloadObject.jsp?id=" +         objectId + "\">";       objectType = "File";     }   And finally display the child objects.   out.println " \n" ;   out.println "   " + objectLink + imagePath +     " &nbsp;" + objectLink + name +     "  \n" ;   out.println "   " + objectType + " \n" ;   out.println " \n" ;   Figure 20.4 shows this page in action.   Figure 20.4. The DisplayObjects.jsp page.      424      The DisplayObjects.jsp page displays the list of objects in a directory and a form the user can use  to upload a file to the directory.      DownloadObject.jsp   The DownloadObject.jsp page is given in Listing 20.4.   Listing 20.4 The DownloadObject.jsp Code       <jsp:useBean id="downloadBean" scope="page"   class="com.brainysoftware.web.FileDownloadBean"  >   <%     String objectId = request.getParameter "id" ;     String userName = dbBean.getCookie request, "userName" ;     String password = dbBean.getCookie request, "password" ;       if  userName == null  password == null        response.sendRedirect "Login.html" ;          'userName' and 'password' cookies are found        now let's see if user has access to the file     String filename = dbBean.getFilename objectId, userName, password ;     if  filename == null          response.sendRedirect "Login.html" ;     else {      downloadBean.forceFilename filename ;       downloadBean.download response, dbBean.getDataPath   + objectId ;     }   %>   First, this page checks whether the Request object carries the user name and password cookies:      425      String objectId = request.getParameter "id" ;   String userName = dbBean.getCookie request, "userName" ;   String password = dbBean.getCookie request, "password" ;   If the user is an authorized user, the user name and password are passed to the getFilename  method along with the object identifier of the object to be downloaded. The getFilename   returns  the filename if the user has the permission to download the file. Otherwise, it returns null, as  follows:   String filename = dbBean.getFilename objectId, userName, password ;   if  filename == null      response.sendRedirect "Login.html" ;   else {    .     .     .   }   You then obtain the data file path where all files are saved.   After you know the user is authorized to download the requested file, downloading the file is easy  using the File Download bean. In fact, you need only two lines of code:   downloadBean.forceFilename filename ;   downloadBean.download response, dbBean.getDataPath   + objectId ;   The forceFilename   method is called to pass the filename that should appear in the Download  dialog box of the browser. If you don't call this method, the Download dialog box will display the  object identifier of the file.   File Upload   File upload is an important feature of a web-based document management system. File upload  allows the user to add a file to a selected folder. File upload is discussed fully in Chapter 13. You  will be using the File Upload bean for this project.   The HTML code for the form used to upload a file is included in the DisplayObjects.jsp file,  whose full listing was given in Listing 20.2. This is the fragment you need:   <FORM METHOD=POST ENCTYPE=MULTIPART FORM-DATA     ACTION=UploadObject.jsp>      ">      Upload File:                    When this form is submitted, the content will go to the UploadObject.jsp page, whose listing is  given in Listing 20.5.   Listing 20.5 The UploadObject.jsp           <jsp:useBean id="uploadBean" scope="page"   class="com.brainysoftware.web.FileUploadBean"  >   <%       426        String userName =       dbBean.getCookie request, "userName" ;     String password =       dbBean.getCookie request, "password" ;       if  userName == null  password == null        response.sendRedirect "Login.html" ;     else {        uploadBean.setSavePath dbBean.getDataPath   ;       uploadBean.doUpload request ;       String uploadedFilename = uploadBean.getFilename  ;       String objectId = Integer.toString dbBean.getLastObjectId   + 1 ;       String parentId = uploadBean.getFieldValue "parentId" ;       if   dbBean.hasUploadPermission parentId, userName, password   {        uploadBean.forceFilename objectId ;         uploadBean.save  ;         dbBean.insertObject parentId, objectId, uploadedFilename ;         dbBean.insertPermissions parentId, objectId ;       }       response.sendRedirect "DisplayObjects.jsp?id="         + parentId ;     }   %>   As usual, this code checks whether the user is authorized by using the first lines of the code:   String userName =     dbBean.getCookie request, "userName" ;   String password =     dbBean.getCookie request, "password" ;     if  userName == null  password == null      response.sendRedirect "Login.html" ;   Start the uploading process by first setting the directory in which the uploaded file will be saved.  You do this by passing the value of the static final DATA_PATH string in the DBBean,  obtainable from the getDataPath   method, as follows:   uploadBean.setSavePath dbBean.getDataPath   ;   Next, you call the doUpload   method of the FileUpload Bean, as follows:   uploadBean.doUpload request ;   The file is not stored by its original filename, but rather by using the object identifier. The original  filename is included in the new row inserted into the Objects table, however. You can obtain the  original name of the uploaded file by using the getFilename   method of the FileUpload bean:   String uploadedFilename = uploadBean.getFilename  ;   The object identifier for the new file is the next number in the Objects table, as the following line  shows:   String objectId = Integer.toString dbBean.getLastObjectId   + 1 ;   You also need the parent directory of the file. The parent identifier is included in the file upload  form and sent to the server, which means that it is one of the fields accompanying the uploaded      427      file. You can obtain this field value by calling the getFieldValue   method of the FileUpload Bean,  as follows:   String parentId = uploadBean.getFieldValue "parentId" ;   As the last attempt to prevent a security breach, you need to use the hasUploadPermission method  to check whether the user has the permission to upload a file into the specified directory:   if  dbBean.hasUploadPermission parentId, userName, password   {   If the user is authorized, you force the uploaded file to take the name of the object identifier and  call the save  method to save it:   uploadBean.forceFilename objectId ;   uploadBean.save  ;   Next, you need to store the meta data of the uploaded file so that it can be retrieved, as follows:   dbBean.insertObject parentId, objectId, uploadedFilename ;   dbBean.insertPermissions parentId, objectId ;   Finally, you redirect the user back to the DisplayObjects.jsp page with the following code:   response.sendRedirect "DisplayObjects.jsp?id=" + parentId ;   Folder Tree   The folder tree is a docman feature that provides easier navigation. You can implement the folder  tree using an applet or JavaScript. With an applet, you have Java at your disposal, which makes  complex programming tasks achievable. However, this also means that the user pays a price for  downloading a few kilobytes of this applet. What's more, you have communication problems  between the applet and the HTML JavaScript code. These two factors made JavaScript more  appealing in this project.   Even though JavaScript is not as powerful as Java, a folder tree implementation is very  straightforward in JavaScript. The result has been tested successfully using the two major  browsersâMicrosoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigatorâbut the code also works in a  JavaScript-enabled browser. The folder tree is explained in length later in this chapter.   Each folder has a few attributes, such as the id and the name, but more importantly, a folder can  have from zero to an unlimited number of child folders. Each child folder in turn can have any  number of its own child folders and this hierarchy can go on to an unlimited number of levels. The  first folder in the hierarchy, the root, is at level 0 of the tree. Its child folders will be at level 1, and  so on.   The JavaScript script for manipulating the folder tree can be found in the FolderTree.html file,  which is given in Listing 20.6. This file hosts two frames. The left frame is the folder tree and the  right frame is for the pages discussed earlier in this first chapter; that is, the Login page and the  DisplayObjects.jsp.

This file is blank and basically not usedâit is here only because Netscape browsers  will complain if you don't have an SRC attribute for every FRAME tag:   <FRAMESET onLoad="initialize  " FRAMEBORDER="0"     FRAMESPACING="0" BORDER="0" cols="225,*">                               Please upgrade your browser to       one that understands frames.                   If Tree.html is blank and not used at all, how do you get the HTML code to paint the folder tree?  As you will see later, the code is generated on the fly by the JavaScript functions on  FolderTree.html. This code is updated continually as the user navigates the folder structure. When  the user clicks one of the folders in the tree, that folder opens and the left frame receives  instruction to request the DisplayObjects.jsp file passing the clicked folder id. This effectively  displays in the right frame all child objects of the clicked folder. Upon displaying the child objects,  the DisplayObjects.jsp file writes JavaScript code that sends an instruction to the FolderTree.html  file to update the previously clicked folder with all child folders it contains. This gives the clicked  folder the opportunity to refresh its content if it has been clicked previously.   Before you start dissecting the FolderTree.html file, notice the number of supporting .gif files used  in building the folder tree  see Figure 20.5 .   Figure 20.5. The supporting .gif files for the folder tree.      For example, a node is simply a vertical dotted line with a shorter horizontal line in the middle,  represented in the figure by the Node.gif image file. If the folder connected by the node has one or  more child folders, however, the node is represented by the NodeMinus.gif or NodePlus.gif image  files. The NodeMinus.gif file is used for expanded nodes and the NodePlus.gif file for collapsed  nodes. Also, for the last child folder, these three image files will be used instead: LastNode.gif,  LastNodeMinus.gif, and LastNodePlus.gif.   The first function to notice in Listing 20.6 is the createFolder function. Used to create an array that  represents a folder, createFolder receives two arguments: the folder id and the folder name. The id  is the unique object id stored in the Objects table. The root, for instance, is the first folder with id      432   equal to 1. The array has three mandatory elements: the id, the name, and the state that describes  whether the node is expanded or collapsed, if it has child folder s :      var folder;   folder = new Array;   folder[0] = id;   folder[1] = name;   folder[2] = 1;   return folder;   When it is first created, a folder array has only three elements. The folder in its original state has  no child folder. To know whether a folder has child folders or how many child folders a folder has,  you can measure the length property of the array. The number of child folders is the value of the  length property minus three.   In a folder tree, a folder never stands alone. Every folder except the root has a parent folder, and  every folder can potentially have one child folder or more. Every folder can be appended as a  child folder of another folder. This is why the appendFolder function is very important here. It  receives three arguments: foldersNode, parentId, and childFolder. The parentId argument is the id  of the folder to be the parent of childFolder. The foldersNode argument is the variable that makes  possible a recursive process to find the parent folder. When the appendFolder is called, you pass  the root as foldersNode. When the function calls itself recursively, however, a child folder is  passed as foldersNode, as shown here:   if  foldersNode[0] == parentId      foldersNode[foldersNode.length] = childFolder;   As you can see, if foldersNode is the folder in question, an array element is implicitly created by  assigning the child folder to the next element after the last element in the array. If it is not the  folder you want, the function recursively calls itself, passing each subfolder as the first argument:   else if  foldersNode.length>3      for  var i=3; i< foldersNode.length; i++        appendFolder         foldersNode[i], parentId, childFolder ;   If a folder has at least one child folder, its node is displayed as a vertical line with a small box  containing a minus  -  or a plus  +  sign. The minus sign is used when the node is expanded; that  is, the child folder is displayed in the folder tree. The plus sign, on the other hand, indicates that  the node is collapsed, meaning that the folder has one or more child folders that are not shown in  the folder tree. As in Windows Explorer, you can click these nodes to change the state from  expanded to collapsed and vice versa.   To enable a node to change its state, you put the Node image in a link that will trigger the  clickNode function when clicked. For example, the following image, which represents an  expanded node, is put inside such a link:               The clickNode function calls the toggleNode function and the redrawTree function. The  toggleNode function searches the folder tree for a folder with the id equal to the folderId argument.  When it finds a match, the function changes the value of the third element of the folder array, as  follows:   if  foldersNode[0] == folderId        433        foldersNode[2] = 1 - foldersNode[2];   else if  foldersNode[2]      for  var i=3; i< foldersNode.length; i++        toggleNode foldersNode[i], folderId ;   Note that the toggleNode function uses the same algorithm as the appendFolder function to  browse through the folder tree for the sought folder. The redrawTree function redraws the whole  folder tree. This function is discussed in detail in the next section.   Similar to a node, a user's click on a folder triggers the clickFolder function, which in turn sends a  message to the other frame to request for the DisplayObjects.jsp with the correct id parameter  value. In order for each folder to be clicked, the image representing the folder must be embedded  in an   tag, as the following shows:               The clickFolder function will do three things if the folder clicked is not the currently open folder:      Set the openFolder variable to folderId argument     Call the redrawTree function     Send a message to the frame on the right to request for the DisplayObjects.jsp with the   appropriate id parameter value using the following line of code. This in effect will display  the correct child objects of the folder clicked.   objectFrame.location="DisplayObjects.jsp?id=" +     folderId;   For every action the user takes, such as collapse a node or open a folder, the left frame has to be  cleared and the folder tree repainted to reflect the change. This task is done by calling the  redrawTree function. In a nutshell, the function clears the left frame's document object, calls the  redrawNode function to repaint the folder tree, and closes the document object:   var doc = top.treeFrame.window.document;   doc.clear  ;   doc.write " " ;   redrawNode folderTree, doc, 0, 1, "" ;   doc.close  ;   The redrawNode function is a recursive function that draws all the nodes, folders, and vertical  lines between two nodes. To align all the objects in the folder tree, a table with no border and  cellspacing and cellpadding both set to 0 is used. The redrawNode accepts these five arguments:   foldersNode. Which is a folder array.  doc. The document object to write the HTML code to.  level. The position of the folder in hierarchy relative to the root. For example, the root has  a level of 0, the child folders of the root have a level of 1, and so on.  lastNode. A flag to indicate whether foldersNode is the last child folder of its parent  folder. This does not have an "y" important effect except for selecting the .gif file for the  node.  leftSide. A string of HTML code that draws one or more Blank.gif and VertLine.gif files  to the left of a folder that has a level greater than 0. This HTML code is necessary  because folders other than the root are aligned a few pixels to the right of their parent  folder.                        434      The important thing to note is that you call the redrawNode function by passing the foldersNode  variable as the first parameter. This variable represents the first folder in the tree, which is the root.  Subsequent recursive calls to this function, however, will pass each folder in the hierarchy. In  addition, foldersNode set as "0" means that the folder has been deleted and therefore will not be  drawn, as follows:   if  foldersNode == "0"      return;   For each node, get the properties of the folder array by using the following code:   var folderId = foldersNode[0];   var folderName = foldersNode[1];   var hasSubNode =  foldersNode.length>3 ;   var expanded = foldersNode[2];   hasSubNode will be true if foldersNode has more than three elements, which indicates the folder  has child folder s .   If you look carefully at Figure 20.1, you will notice that no two folders have the same vertical  position. You can imagine the folder tree as a table with many rows in which every row is  occupied by only one single folder. In fact, every row is represented by an HTML table to align  the images easily, as you see here:   doc.write "<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0" +     " CELLPADDING=0>" ;   doc.write "  " ;   doc.write leftSide ;   var nodeLink =     "<A HREF='javascript:top.clickNode "       + folderId + " '>";   The rest of the code of the redrawNode function draws the nodes, folders, and vertical lines for  each folder in the tree. For folders whose level is greater than 0, a number of Blank.gif files will  be drawn to the left of the node, as follows:     if  level>0        if  lastNode  {   the last folder in array         if  hasSubNode  {          if  expanded              doc.write nodeLink +   "<IMG SRC='images LastNodeMinus.gif'" +   " BORDER=0 WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=22>" + " " ;           else             doc.write nodeLink +   "<IMG SRC='images LastNodePlus.gif'" +   " BORDER=0 WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=22>" + " " ;         }         else           doc.write "<IMG SRC='images LastNode.gif'" +             " WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=22>" ;         leftSide += "<IMG SRC='images blank.gif'" +           " WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=22>";       }       else {   not last folder         if  hasSubNode  {          if  expanded              doc.write nodeLink +       435      "<IMG SRC='images NodeMinus.gif'" +   " BORDER=0 WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=22>" + " " ;           else             doc.write nodeLink +   "<IMG SRC='images NodePlus.gif'" +   " BORDER=0 WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=22>" + " " ;         }         else           doc.write "<IMG SRC='images Node.gif'" +             " WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=22>" ;         leftSide += "<IMG SRC='images vertline.gif'" +           " WIDTH=16 HEIGHT=22>";       }   doc.write "<A HREF='javascript:top.clickFolder "     + folderId + " '><IMG SRC=images " ;       if  folderId == openFolderId      doc.write "openfolder.gif WIDTH=24 HEIGHT=22"       + " BORDER=0> " ;   else     doc.write "closedfolder.gif WIDTH=24 HEIGHT=22"       + " BORDER=0> " ;   doc.write " " ;   doc.write " "     + folderName +" " ;   doc.write " "    At the end of the code, the function will call itself to draw the child folder s  if the folder is  expanded, incrementing level by one:     if  hasSubNode && expanded  {      level++;       for  i=3; i<foldersNode.length;i++          if  i == foldersNode.length-1          redrawNode             foldersNode[i], doc, level, 1, leftSide ;         else           redrawNode             foldersNode[i], doc, level, 0, leftSide ;     }   }   The last function in the folder tree system is the deleteSubfolder function. Because of the  difficulty of deleting an array element, a folder will be considered deleted when set to "0". The  deleteSubfolder function accepts two arguments: foldersNode and parentId. The latter argument is  the id of the folder to be "deleted," and the first argument is used to find the correct folder to  delete. You pass the root when you call this function. If the folder id is the same as parentId, the  folder will be marked as "0".   if  foldersNode[0] == parentId  {    for  var i=foldersNode.length-1; i>=3; iââ  {      foldersNode[i] = "0";     }   }   If the folder is not the intended folder, the function will call itself, passing each child folder as the  first argument, as follows:      436      else if  foldersNode.length>3      for  var i=foldersNode.length-1; i>=3; iââ        deleteSubfolder foldersNode[i], parentId ;   The deleteSubfolder function would not be needed if not for this fact: The user can navigate the  folder tree, opening a folder, and collapsing or expanding a node; however, the folder tree also  must reflect in the right frame  the DisplayObjects.jsp page  the user's navigation. When the user  clicks a child folder in the current folder, the child folder will be the open folder, and this must be  reflected in the folder tree. When the user goes one level up by clicking the Up image, the folder  tree must change the open folder. When the user opens another folder, the folder tree must display  all the child folders of that folder. Because a child folder can be deleted or a new child folder can  be appended by other users, you need to refresh the open folder. You do this from the  DisplayObjects.jsp by calling the appendFolder functions on the frame's parent for every child  folder:   for  int i=0; i<records.size  ; i++  {    .     .     .       js+="parent.appendFolder parent.folderTree,"       + id + ",parent.createFolder "       + objectId + ",'" + name + "'  ;\n";     .     .     .   }   Before you append new child folders, however, you must delete the previous child folders  appended the first time the folder is opened. The following is the code to do that:   parent.deleteSubfolder parent.folderTree,   ;   Otherwise, the child folders will be displayed twice.   Further Enhancement   As stated at the beginning of the project, not all features of this project are discussed here because  of space limitation. For example, this example provides no way for the user to add or delete a file  or folder. Additionally, you can't edit the permission for each user, and I haven't introduced the  concept of groups.   You may also want to include more information for each object, such as file size, date creation,  multiple-level permissions, and so on. For multiple-level permissions, you could have permissions  to view, to edit, and to view edit. Another important feature not covered here is document  versioning and the logging of user activity.   You can add countless features to make this project better. The features you choose to implement  depend on your needs; and implementing them will be left as an exercise for you to explore.       Summary      437      Web-based document management is a broad topic, and creating a complete system takes many  different features. This chapter presented the concept of web-based document management and  gave you the basic features.      438                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®    Part II: Client-Side Programming with JavaScript      Part II Client-Side Programming with JavaScript    21 JavaScript Basics     22 Client-Side Programming Basics    23 Redirection     24 Client-Side Input Validation     25 Working with Client-Side Cookies    26 Working with Object Trees     27 Controlling Applets      439      Chapter 21. JavaScript Basics   The last 20 chapters have demonstrated server-side programming using servlets and JSP pages. In  this type of programming, the server takes all the workload. Because a popular web site can attract  a large number of hits per hour, scalability is important. Otherwise, your web site can get knocked  out several times a week by the sheer number of visitors it receives. You can make your site more  scalable a number of different ways, one of which is to reduce your server's workload by moving  some of the processing to the client sideânamely, in the web browser.   To understand this point, consider the case in which you have an HTML registration form that  contains some fields that must be filled in by users. With only server-side processing, you will  have to check whether the user has entered all mandatory values. Even if one mandatory field is  not filled in, your code will have to send an error message. The error message can be sent within a  different HTML page or in the same registration page. If you choose the first approach, the user  can then use the Back button in the web browser to go back to the previous page. If you decide to  embed the error message in the same registration form, you have to resend the form and make sure  that the previously entered values also are sent back to the user, which keeps users from having to  type the same values a second time.   Either method you choose, however, creates an extra round trip to the server that could be avoided.  Not only could this cause your user frustration if the connection is very slow, but it also creates an  unnecessary workload for the web server. What's more, input validation doesn't end here. You still  need to check whether the user has entered a correct value for all inputsâsuch as numeric values  for a numeric type of data, and so forth. If one of the input fields is incorrect, you have to do the  same thing to ask the user to make some correction. Lastly, you also need to truncate all leading  and trailing spaces that might be present in a field value.   Wouldn't it be nice if all input values were sent to the server only if they were all valid and their  leading and trailing spaces, if any, had been truncated? You can do this with JavaScript client-side  processing. Why JavaScript? The reason is simple: JavaScript is understood by the two dominant  browsers at presentâMicrosoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator. For an Internet  developer, an understanding of JavaScript is as important as an understanding of HTML.   The JavaScript lessons in this chapter and the chapters to come do not cover all features of this  scripting language; instead, they are intended to provide a basic foundation. JavaScript is a serious  subject that requires a book of its own to be covered thoroughly. By studying the lessons in these  chapters, however, you will be prepared to tackle most of the client-side programming problems in  web application development.   This chapter is offered as a crash course on JavaScript and is for those readers who have little or  no understanding of JavaScript. Those who are already JavaScript gurus can skip this chapter  entirely and move on to the next.     Introduction to JavaScript   Originally, JavaScript was called LiveScript. Contrary to what some people believe, JavaScript has  nothing to do with Java. The name selection for JavaScript was more for marketing purposes.  JavaScript was created by Netscape, and Java is a product of Sun Microsystems. Although  JavaScript is a complete and mature language of its own, when we talk about JavaScript in this  book, we are referring to the JavaScript as implemented in web browsers.      440      Another important fact to remember is that JavaScript is implemented somewhat differently in  Internet Explorer and Navigator. Microsoft has even developed its own version of JavaScript  called JScript. This book uses the portion of JavaScript that is implemented both browsers, in  particular by versions 3.0 and later.   That being said, it is true that some aspects of JavaScript are similar to those in Java. These  aspects are contrasted in the sections that follow.   Case-Sensitivity   As a starter, JavaScript is case-sensitive. Therefore, myVar is different from MyVar or myvar.  Names for event handlers, such as onclick, must be written in lowercase letters in JavaScript, even  though it can be written as onClick or OnClick in HTML because HTML is not case-sensitive.  Confusion often arises regarding case-sensitivity because JavaScript is not implemented exactly  the same in the two major browsers. Netscape browsers regard case-sensitivity as sacred, whereas  Internet Explorer takes it half-heartedly. For example, the objects, methods, and properties added  to the language in IE are case-insensitive while built-in objects, such as Math and Date, are case- sensitive in IE.   For this reason, you should apply strict case-sensitivity in your code to maintain compatibility  between the two browsers. The reason for some case-insensitivity in IE is that IE allows the same  client-side objects to be used by VBScript, a scripting language that is not case-sensitive.  Microsoft therefore reckons that their client-side objects must not be case-sensitive either.  Because of Microsoft's requirement for VBScript, it's not likely that the client-side objects will  become case-sensitive in a future version of IE. This means that you can't take advantage of  Navigator's case-sensitivity to create different variables with the same spelling but different  capitalizations.   Terminating a Line of Code   Unlike in Java, the semicolon that terminates a line of code in JavaScript is optional. For instance,  it is perfectly legal to write these two lines without semicolons:   str = "Cockroaches can live up to one year. ";   a = 123;   But if you put more than one statement in one single line, the semicolons are required, as follows:   str = "Cockroaches can live up to one year. "; a = 123;   JavaScript comments are exactly like Java comments: Use the    for comment-ing one single line  and the  * .. *  pair for comments that are one line long or longer. Consider this example:   For clarity, always use a semicolon.   Comments      divide by two   b = 489   2;    * Now check which one of the two      is larger   *    Strings      441      Strings can be enclosed within single or double quotation marks. For example, both of the  following lines are legal in JavaScript:   s1 = "Silk was discovered in about 3000 BC.";   s2 = 'Silk was first discovered in China.';   Further, double-quote characters may be contained within strings delimited by single-quote  characters, and single-quote characters may be contained within a string delimited by double  quotes. For example, these are valid statements:   s1 = "His name is Tim O'Connor.";   s2 = 'He is known as Tim "The Great".';   If you like to stick to one string programming style, you can use a preceding backslash character  \   before the single quote or the double quote. The two preceding strings can be rewritten as follows:   s1 = 'His name is Tim O\'Connor.';   s2 = "He is known as Tim \"The Great\".";   Like in Java, you use the plus  +  sign to concatenate strings. For instance,   s1 = 'His name is Tim O\'Connor.';   s2 = "He is known as Tim \"The Great\".";   s3 = s1 + ' ' + s2;      s3 now contains: His name is Tim O'Connor. He is known as Time  "The   Great".   Java is strongly typed, whereas JavaScript is loosely typed. JavaScript variables can hold values of  any data type; however, you use functions to convert one data type to another, as you see later in  this chapter.   Typedness   Variable Declarations   var myVar;   var s1 = "users";   You can use a variable without first declaring it. Good programming practice, however, suggests  that you always declare your variables. You can declare a variable using the var keyword,  followed by the variable name, as in the following:   You also can initialize a variable at the same time you declare it. For example:   You also can initialize a variable when the first occurrence of the variable is in a statement:   The if statement in JavaScript is the same as the if statement in Java. It has the following syntax:   for  var i = 0; i < 100; i++    The if Statements   if  expression  {      442           statement-1       statement-2      .      .      .      statement-m      }      [else {     statement-n      statement-o     .     .     .     statement-z     }]   The while Loop   while  expression  {    statement-1     statement-2     .     .     .     statement-m   }   The for loop   As in Java, the while loop has the following syntax:   Again, identical to Java, the for loop in JavaScript has the following syntax:   for  initialize ; test ; increment  {    statement-1     statement-2     .     .     .     statement-m   }   The with keyword   JavaScript uses the with keyword, which is not available in Java. The syntax is shown here:   with  object  {    statement-1     statement-2     .     .     .     statement-m   }   So, instead of writing this code:      443      x = Math.sin a ;   y = Math.cos a ;   you can write the following:   with Math  {    x = sin a ;     y = cos a ;   }   Boolean Expressions   A boolean expression can be evaluated using the == and != operators, just like in Java. For  example, consider this code:   if  a == b      str = 'The two numbers are equal.';   else {    a = b + 12;     str = 'The two numbers are not equal.';   }   Logical and Bitwise Operators   As in Java, you use the double ampersand  &&  as the logical AND, and the double pipe  characters    as the logical OR. You use a single ampersand  &  as the bitwise AND, and a single  pipe character    as the bitwise OR.   Functions   A function uses the following syntax:   function functionName arg-1, arg-2, ... arg-n  {    statement-1;     statement-2;     .     .     .     statement-m;   }   The following example defines the factorial function that computes factorials:   function factorial n  {    if  n <=1        return 1;     else       return n * factorial n-1 ;   }   Knowing the answer to the following question is important when you are learning a new  programming language: How do arguments get passed in a function? By value or reference? In  JavaScript, whether an argument is passed by value or by reference depends on the type of the  argument. The basic rule says that primitive types are manipulated by value and reference types by  reference. Examples of primitive types include numbers and booleans. They are primitive because  they consist of nothing more than a small fixed number of bytes; bytes that are easily manipulated      444   at the low  primitive  levels of the JavaScript interpreter. On the other hand, objects and arrays are  reference types. These data types can contain arbitrary numbers of properties or elements. Because  objects and arrays can become very large, it doesn't make sense to manipulate these types by value,  because doing so could involve the inefficient copying and comparing of large amount of memory.  There is an anomaly in string data type, though. Strings are passed by reference, but when you  compare a string in your function, it is the value that is being compared, not the reference.   The String Object and the string Data Type   The String object is widely used in JavaScript. Among other properties, String has the length  property that returns the number of characters in a string:   var str, a;   str = "Let's use JavaScript";   a = str.length;    a has a value of 20 after this line is executed   String also has the following methods that should be familiar to any Java programmer: charAt,  toUpperCase, substring, and so on. The list of members of the String object can be found in the  last section of this chapter.   JavaScript Keywords   The following is the list of keywords in JavaScript:      break   continue   delete   function   else   false   for   if   in   new   null   return   this   true   typeof      445   Reserved Words   The following is the list of the reserved words in JavaScript:      var   void   while   with   abstract   boolean   byte   case   catch   char   class   const   default   do   double   extends   final   finally   float   goto   implements   import   instanceof   int   interface      446   synchronized      long   native   package   private   protected   public   short   static   super   switch   throw   throws   transient   try   alert   Anchor   Area   Array   assign   blur   Boolean   Button   Checkbox      Illegal Identifiers   The following are identifiers that are used by the JavaScript language itself and should not be used  in your JavaScript code:   447      clearTimeout   close   closed   confirm   Date   defaultStatus   Document   document   Element   escape   eval   FileUpload   focus   Form   Frame   frames   Function   getClass   hidden   History   history   Image   isNaN   java   JavaArray   JavaClass   JavaObject      448                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       JavaPackage   length   Link   Location   location   Math   MimeType   name   navigate   Navigator   navigator   netscape   Number   Object   onblur   onerror   onfocus   onload   onunload   open   opener   Option   Packages   parent   parseFloat   parseInt   password      449   setTimeout      Plugin   prompt   prototype   Radio   ref   Reset   scroll   Select   self   status   String   Submit   sun   taint   Text   Textarea   top   toString   unescape   untaint   valueOf   Window   window       Adding JavaScript Code to HTML      450      To the server, JavaScript code is merely text, just like HTML. To the web browser, however, this  text has special meaning that can be interpreted differently. To tell the web browser that a piece of  text is actually JavaScript code, you enclose it between the   and   tags, as in the  following example:              your scripts go here         Actually, unless you want your HTML page to pass the validation by a W3 HTML validating  machine, you don't need the type attribute in the script tag. The Language attribute is necessary  because there is more than one scripting language that can be embedded between the   and    tags. By specifying in the   tag which language is used to write a script, the  browser can decide whether it should try to interpret it. If the script is written in a language the  web browser doesn't understand, the script should then be skipped.   You can write your JavaScript code anywhere in the HTML page. You can write your JavaScript  script between the   and   tags, like this:                      your scripts go here                   Here if your HTML body             Alternatively, you can present it in the body section, as these two examples show:                            your scripts go here           Here if your HTML body             or                       451        Here if your HTML body                your scripts go here                 The   and   tags can appear more than once in different sections, if necessary.   Like other HTML tags, the JavaScript code is executed whenever the web browser sees it. This  means that if you put your JavaScript code in the Head section, it will be executed even before the  HTML tags in the Body section are parsed. If the processing time is too long, however, the user  might see the delay and might find it annoying.   As an example, this HTML page contains JavaScript that writes "Hello" inside the page body:              Some JavaScript                  document.write "Hello." ;               This is the same as writing the following:              Some JavaScript            Hello.           Note       JavaScript Object Model   In JavaScript, functions can appear anywhere throughout the HTML page. When you call  a function, however, you have to make sure that the function has existed when it is being  called.  When I say 'has existed' I mean the web browser has passed the point where the  function is defined in the HTML page.    Programming JavaScript basically revolves around the JavaScript object model. Figure 21.1  shows a subset of the object model.      452      Figure 21.1. The subset of JavaScript's object model.      The Window object is the central object that represents the web browser window. It has a number  of child objects: the Location object, the Document object, the History object, and others that are  not shown in Figure 21.1. Each Window object contains a document property that refers to the  Document object associated with the window. The convention in JavaScript is that the Window  object is referenced by default. This means that to use one of its child objects or properties, you  just mention the child object, the property, or the method in your code. To refer to an object in the  lower hierarchy, you use a period to separate it from its parent object. For example, to refer to the  first HTML element in the second form in the HTML page, you use this code:   document.forms[1].elements[0]   The Window object also has a number of methods, such as alert  , confirm  , and prompt  . You  can use the Window object's method without mentioning the Window object in your code, as in  the following:   alert 'Please enter a value in the "Phone" box.' ;   This is the same as writing:   window.alert 'Please enter a value in the "Phone" box.' ;   The Window object is discussed in further detail at the end of this chapter.       Event Handler   JavaScript adds interactivity to the static HTML by allowing you to write event-driven code. An  HTML element can then be connected to a function that gets called automatically when something  happens to the HTML element. For example, you can connect a button to a function that gets  invoked when the user clicks the button by using the following code:          453      Area  Button  Checkbox  FileUpload  Form  Frame  Image  Link  Radio  Reset  Select  Submit  Text  Textarea  Window   Table 21.1 lists supported JavaScript event handlers.   Object   Table 21.1. JavaScript Event Handlers   Event Handlers   onClick, onMouseOut, onMouseOver  onBlur, onClick, onFocus  onBlur, onClick, onFocus  onBlur, onChange, onFocus  onReset, onSubmit  onLoad, onUnload  onAbort, onError, onLoad  onClick, onMouseOut, onMouseOver  onBlur, onClick, onFocus  onBlur, onClick, onFocus  onBlur, onChange, onFocus  onBlur, onClick, onFocus  onBlur, onChange, onFocus  onBlur, onChange, onFocus  onBlur, onError, onFocus, onLoad, onUnload   Unfortunately, some incompatibilities exist between browsers running in UNIX and those running  in Windows. Netscape Navigator for Windows, for instance, doesn't recognize the Click event for  an Area element. With Netscape Navigator for UNIX, some form elementsâsuch as Area, button,  checkbox, radio, reset, select, and submitârecognize only the Click event but not the Blur and  Focus events.   Another type of event is not triggered by user interaction: The Timer event gets triggered when  specified periods of time have elapsed. As you might expect, this can be useful for animation.       Window and String Objects   This last section provides a short reference of the two most widely used objects in JavaScript: the  Window object and the String object.   Window Object   Properties   The Window object represents a browser window or frame. This is the root of the JavaScript  object hierarchy.   The following is the list of properties of the Window object.   closed A read-only Boolean that specifies whether a window has been closed.   defaultStatus A read write string that specifies the default message to appear in the status line.      454      document A reference to the Document object contained in the window.   frames[ ] An array of frames contained by this window.   history A reference to the History object for this window.   java A reference to the JavaPackage object that is the top of the package name hierarchy for the  core Java packages that comprise the Java language.   length A read-only value that evaluates to the number of elements in the frames[ ] array.   location A reference to the Location object for this window.   Math A reference to an object holding various mathematical functions and constants.   name A string that contains the name of the window. The name is optionally specified when the  window is created with the open   method.   navigator A reference to the Navigator object that applies to this and all other windows.   netscape A reference to the JavaPackage object which is the top of the Java package name  hierarchy for the netscape Java packages from Netscape.   opener A read write property that refers to the Window object that called open   to create this  window.   packages A reference to a JavaPackage object that represents the top of the Java package name  hierarchy.   parent A reference to the parent window or frame of the current window. This is useful only  when the current window is a frame rather than a top-level window.   self A reference to the window itself. A synonym of window.   status A read write string that specifies the current contents of the status line.   sun A reference to the JavaPackage object which is the top of the Java package name hierarchy  for the sun Java packages from Sun Microsystems.   top A reference to the top-level window that contains the current window. This is useful only  when the current window is a frame rather than a top-level window.   window A reference to the window itself. A synonym of self.   Methods   The following are the methods of the Window object.   alert   Displays a simple message in a dialog box.   blur   Takes keyboard focus from the top-level browser window; this sends the window to the  background on most platforms.   clearTimeout   Cancels a pending timeout operation.      455      close   Closes a window.   confirm   Asks a yes or no question using a dialog box.   focus   Gives the top-level browser window keyboard focus; this brings the window to the front  on most platforms.   open   Creates and opens a new window.   prompt   Asks for simple string input with a dialog box.   scroll   Scrolls the document displayed in the window.   setTimeout   Executes code after a specified amount of time elapses.   The String Object   The String object provides the length property, which returns the number of characters in the  string, and the following methods:   anchor   Returns a copy of the string in an   environment.   big   Returns a copy of the string in a   environment.   blink   Returns a copy of the string in a   environment.   bold   Returns a copy of the string in a   environment.   charAt   Extracts the character at a given position from a string.   fixed   Returns a copy of the string in a   environment.   fontcolor   Returns a copy of the string in a   environment.   fontsize   Returns a copy of the string in a   environment.   indexOf   Searches the string for a character or substring.   italics   Returns a copy of the string in an   environment.   lastIndexOf   Searches the string backward for a character or substring.   link   Returns a copy of the string in an   environment.   small   Returns a copy of the string in a   environment.   split   Converts a string to an array of strings using a specified delimiter character.   strike   Returns a copy of the string in a   environment.   sub   Returns a copy of the string in a   environment.   substring   Extracts a substring of a string.      456   sup   Returns a copy of the string in a   environment.   toLowerCase   Returns a copy of the string with all characters converted to lowercase.   toUpperCase   Returns a copy of the string with all characters converted to uppercase.          Summary   This chapter presented a crash course on JavaScript for those of you not familiar with the language.  This chapter is not a complete reference on this language; but by reading and mastering the  examples shown here, you should be able to write client-side programs to be executed in the web  browser.      457      Chapter 22. Client-Side Programming Basics   Client-side programming offers benefits that not only contribute to the level of scalability of your  web application, but also can make a big difference in user satisfaction. When writing code for the  client side, however, you are faced with a different challenge from server-side programming. Your  code will be run by many different browsers from different vendors with different power and  capabilities. As such, cross-browser code is the biggest issue and making your code executable in  all browsers is the biggest challenge.   In this chapter, you learn the sort of problems that you will encounter when programming for the  client side, problems that you should be aware of even before you write your first line of code.  There are, of course, codes that can help you solve the problems.   This chapter starts with some techniques for a very basic function: tips on how to check whether  your JavaScript code can run in the user browser. This chapter then continues with a discussion of  how various versions of browsers and various versions of JavaScript affect the way you should  write your code.       Checking Whether JavaScript Is Enabled   JavaScript enables you to go beyond HTML. Before you start coding JavaScript, however, bear in  mind that some people in some parts of this planet still use what can be categorized as direct  descendants of the browser "origin of species," those which are too primitive to understand  JavaScript. Living in an era where everything is Internet-ready, you may find that hard to believe.   Even if you can guarantee that all the users who come to visit your web site have at least the  fourth generation of web browsers, you don't have the discretion to turn the JavaScript features on  or off. Some of your users probably have the feature switched off without realizing it.  Additionally, a large number of Internet surfers don't know what JavaScript is, let alone know how  to turn this capability on. This means that when you are programming JavaScript for your web  pages, it is important to make sure that JavaScript is supported and turned on. You cannot assume  that everyone can see the JavaScript magic you send to the browser.   You can use a number of techniques for checking whether the user browser supports and or is  supporting JavaScript. These techniques are given in the following sections.   Checking with Redirection   Using redirection is the easiest way to determine whether JavaScript is enabled. This technique is  the simplest of all. You use this script on the first page of your web site that requires JavaScript  processing. The script presumes that JavaScript is not supported or not enabled, so users will get a  message asking them to change the browser or turn on the JavaScript feature. Users who have  JavaScript enabled will be redirected to the actual main page before they can see the message.  They then can continue surfing happily.   Listing 22.1 shows such a page. You redirect the user to another page using the window object's  location property of the Netscape Navigator's document object model.   Listing 22.1 Redirection Using the Location Property      458                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®                Checking whether JavaScript is on        location="ActualMainPage.html"               This web site requires that you use a JavaScript enabled   browser. Unfortunately, your browsers are either too old   to understand JavaScript or the feature is turned off.   Please click  here  for more information.           Users who don't have JavaScript enabled will see the message; hopefully, they will not be too  disheartened to come back to your site.   This technique can be used with Netscape Navigator versions 2 and higher, and Internet Explorer  version 3 and higher.   Checking JavaScript with a Form   The previous tip works well, but sometimes only one specific page in your entire web application  needs the browser's JavaScript powerâsuch as when the user needs to submit a form. At that  point, you should not disrupt the users' enjoyment by forcing them to enable their JavaScript  feature. For example, suppose that in your membership web application you use JavaScript only to  validate input in the member-only pages. In this case, your users can still visit the promotional  non-JavaScript pages that try to attract them to join. Only if they become members will they be  required to enable the JavaScript feature. You then can do the testing when your users are ready to  submit a formâperhaps the Login formâbefore they enter the member-only area.   Listing 22.2 shows a form that checks whether JavaScript is on. The HTML page includes a  HIDDEN element called JavaScriptEnabled whose initial value is 0. When the form is submitted,  you can check the value of JavaScriptEnabled on the server side. If the value is 0, it means  JavaScript is not supported or not enabled in the user's browser. You can either warn the user by  sending a "Message" page or just keep quiet and take an extra processing step. At least you know  that JavaScript is not enabled for this user. If you use JavaScript for input validation in this way,  you are prepared to validate user input on the server for people who are using non-scriptable  browsers.   On the other hand, if the server receives the value of 1 for the JavaScriptEnabled element, the  JavaScript on the browser is doing its job.   Listing 22.2 Using a Form to Detect Whether JavaScript Is On            Checking JavaScript using a form              <FORM NAME =LoginForm METHOD=POST ACTION=Register.jsp   onSubmit="document.LoginForm.JavaScriptEnabled.value=1">                  &nbsp;        459                  Warning   Note that you should not rely on JavaScript working and assume that the browser will  send valid input if JavaScript is on. A clever user can have JavaScript turned off and yet  give the server the impression that it is on. For example, the form in Listing 22.3 can trick  the server into thinking that JavaScript is on, when it actually is not.   Listing 22.3 Trying to Fool the Server that Checks Whether JavaScript Is On            Let the server think JavaScript is on                                &nbsp;                If input validation is critical in your application, always do both the client-side and server-side  validations. The client-side validation using JavaScript is still useful for reducing server's  workload.   This technique works in Netscape Navigator version 2.0 and higher, and Internet Explorer version  3.0 and higher.   Checking Whether JavaScript Is On in JavaScript-Capable  Browsers   Unlike the previous two techniques that assume no knowledge of whether the browser supports  JavaScript, the following technique is used to determine whether JavaScript is turned on in a  browser that supports JavaScript. It works like this: All JavaScript-capable browsers will ignore  the   â¦   tags if JavaScript is turned off. When JavaScript is off, however,  these browsers will interpret the   â¦   tags. Using these tags, you can  tell users to turn on their JavaScript feature in the browser.   An HTML page that uses this trick is given in Listing 22.4.   Listing 22.4 Code for Checking for JavaScript in JavaScript-Capable Browsers            Checking if JavaScript is on in a JavaScript-capable  browser                    your JavaScript code here           460          Your browser understands JavaScript. However, the feature   is turned off. Please turn it on to enjoy the full   capability of this page.               This technique can be used with Netscape Navigator version 2 and higher, and Internet Explorer  version 3 and higher.       Handling JavaScript-Unaware Browsers   Even though they are rare, some very old browsers that don't support JavaScript are still used. If  you cannot guarantee that all your users will be using browsers that understand JavaScript, you  need to understand what will happen to the rendering process of the script in those browsers. At  least the script will be displayed as it is, potentially confusing your users because they see text that  does not make sense. The worst effect could be disastrous:Your JavaScript could mess up the  whole content of the page.   You can handle this situation by enclosing the script lines between HTML comment symbols; that  is, between the   tags. Most scriptable browsers completely ignore the content between  those tags. See Listing 22.5 for an example of a page that hides JavaScript code from JavaScript- unaware browsers.   Listing 22.5 Hiding JavaScript Code from JavaScript-Unaware Browsers            Page that hides JavaScript from primitive browsers        <!--    your JavaScript code here        -->               The two forward slashes at the end of the construction are for JavaScript-aware browsers. They  tell the JavaScript interpreter to skip the line entirely; otherwise JavaScript would try to interpret  the ending HTML comment tag  --> .   You can use this technique with Netscape Navigator version 2 and higher, and Internet Explorer  version 3 and higher.       Handling Different Versions of JavaScript      461      JavaScript came to this world as version 1.0, embedded in Netscape Navigator 2. When Navigator  3 was released, it brought with it a more mature version of JavaScript: version 1.1. JavaScript  included in Navigator 4 is version 1.2. With Microsoft browsers, JavaScript's versioning story is  much different. Internet Explorer 3 understands the level of JavaScript in Navigator 2; however,  Internet Explorer 4 understands JavaScript 1.2.   Naturally each newer version of JavaScript includes features that were not available in the  previous versions. If you must use JavaScript 1.2 language but cannot guarantee that your users  will not be using Navigator 2 and 3 and Internet Explorer 3 browsers, you need to include  JavaScript versions that will be understood by the older browsers.   Listing 22.6 outlines the handling of multiple versions of JavaScript. For this to work, you must  lay out the   tags in ascending order of version. The last function that the browser  knows how to interpret is the one that gets executed.   Listing 22.6 A Page that Handles Different Versions of JavaScript            Handling different versions of JavaScript        <!--       statements for JavaScript 1.0 browsers             <!--       statements for JavaScript 1.1 browsers             <!--       statements for JavaScript 1.2 browsers               You can use this technique with Netscape Navigator version 2 and higher, and Internet Explorer  version 3 and higher.       Including a JavaScript File   When you write JavaScript code to be executed in the client side, oftentimes you have a bunch of  JavaScript functions that will be used in many pages. Pasting all functions into all pages that will  use them creates a maintenance horror. The solution is to save the functions in a separate file   preferably a .js file  and include it in the SRC attribute of the   tag. Listing 22.7 shows  a page that uses the SRC attribute of the   tag to include a JavaScript source file.   Listing 22.7 Including a JavaScript Source File            Including a JavaScript source file        462                           you can call the JavaScript function in MyFunctions.js file here               Note that the included file does not begin with a   tag and does not end with a    tag. Also, the included file does not have to end with a .js extension.   You can use this technique with Netscape Navigator version 2 and higher, and Internet Explorer  version 3 and higher.       Checking the Operating System   You may be wondering whether there is any circumstance that requires you to check the operating  systems your web site visitors are using. After all, it's their business to stick to any "ideology" in  choosing an operating system. And, as long as their browser supports some version of JavaScript,  you can sit happily coding. I can tell you about a few scenarios, however, that are more than  hypothetical situations. One such scenario occurs when your web site provides device drivers for  various operating systems ranging from Windows to Mac to UNIX to Linux. You want your site  visitors  who clearly are visiting to download a device driver  to be given the link to the version of  the operating system of the computers they are using. The technique to check the operating system  is given in Listing 22.8.   Listing 22.8 Checking the User Operating System               <!--  function getOperatingSystem  {    var os;     var v = navigator.appVersion.toUpperCase  ;     if  1+v.indexOf 'WIN95'   1+v.indexOf 'WINDOWS 95'         1+v.indexOf 'WIN32'         os = 'Win95';     else if  1+v.indexOf 'WIN98'         1+v.indexOf 'WINDOWS 98'         os = 'Win98';     else if  1+v.indexOf 'WINNT'          1+v.indexOf 'WINDOWS NT'         os = 'WinNT';   WinNT or Win2K     else if  1+v.indexOf 'WINDOWS 3.1'         os = 'Win3.1';     else if  1+v.indexOf 'WINDOWS 3'         os = 'Win3';     else if  1+v.indexOf 'WIN16'         os = 'Win16';     might be 3.x or NT.     else if  1+v.indexOf 'MAC'   &&        1+v.indexOf 'PPC'   1+v.indexOf 'POWERPC'          os = 'Macintosh ppc';     else if  1+v.indexOf 'MAC'         463          os = 'Mac68K';     else if  1+v.indexOf 'SUNOS'         os = 'Sun';     else if  1+v.indexOf 'LINUX'         os = 'Linux';     else if  1+v.indexOf 'IRIX'         os = 'Irix'     else if  1+v.indexOf 'HP-UX'         os = 'HP-UX';     else if  1+v.indexOf 'OSF'         os = 'OSF';     else if  1+v.indexOf 'AIX'         os = 'AIX';     else if  1+v.indexOf 'OS 2'         os = 'OS 2';     else if  1+v.indexOf 'WEBTV'         os = 'WebTv';     document.forms[0].OS.value=os;   }     -->               Welcome to Brainy Software. We are happy to provide you   with the version of device driver that works with   your operating system.   Please click the button below to start downloading.       <FORM METHOD=POST ACTION="Download.jsp"     onSubmit='getOperatingSystem  '>                       Upon submit, the OS hidden input element will have the value according to the user's operating  system. Another way to determine the operating system in use is to check the HTTP header's  USER AGENT string value on the server; however, processing it in the client side reduces the  server work.   You can use this technique with Netscape Navigator version 2 and higher, and Internet Explorer  version 3 and higher.       Checking the Browser Generation   Knowing which generation of browser the user is running enables you to cater to various  JavaScript versions by sending the appropriate function that works for that browser.   You can use the appVersion property of the navigator object for this purpose. The value returned  by this property is as follows:   version number [language]  operating system information       464      For example, in the Netscape Navigator 4.02 browser for Windows 95, a typical returned value of  this property is 4.02 â  Win95; I; Nav . In Internet Explorer 3.01 for Windows 95 it is 2.0   compatible; MSIE 3.01; Windows 95 . The latter browser actually emulates Navigator 2.  Therefore, version 3 of IE has the application version of 2. Note also that the language part is  optional.   The getBrowserGeneration JavaScript function in Listing 22.9 can be used to obtain the browser  generation information.   Listing 22.9 Obtaining the Browser Generation Information       <function getBrowserGeneration   {    return navigator.appVersion.charAt 0 ;   }       This technique can be used with Netscape Navigator version 2 and higher, and Internet Explorer 3  and higher.       Checking the Browser Type   Many times when you are programming JavaScript, especially when you are touching the area of  dynamic HTML  DHTML , you need to check whether IE or Netscape is being used because the  browsers have different standards for DHTML. The two JavaScript functions in Listing 22.10 do  the trick. The isNetscapeBrowser function returns true if the user is using a Netscape browser. The  isMicrosoftBrowser function returns true if the user is using a Microsoft browser.   Listing 22.10 Checking the Browser Type       function isNetscapeBrowser   {    return  navigator.appName == "Netscape" ;   }     function isMicrosoftBrowser   {    return  navigator.userAgent.indexOf "MSIE"  != -1 ;   }       This technique works with Netscape Navigator version 2 and higher, and Internet Explorer version  3 and higher.       Checking the Browser Language   If you happen to be the webmaster for an international corporation, you probably need to maintain  several versions of the company web site in different languages. In Netscape Navigator 4 and  higher, you can query the language property of the navigator object to find out the language  version of the browser. Such a property does not exist in Internet Explorer, however.      465      da  de  en  es  fr  it  ja  ko  nl  pt  sv   For example, if the browser language is German, the value of navigator.language is de. Table 22.1  lists the language code and its language.   Table 22.1. The Language Code for navigator.language for Several Languages   Language Code   Language   Danish  German  English  Spanish  French  Italian  Japanese  Korean  Dutch  Brazilian Portuguese  Swedish   If you cannot guarantee that all your users will use a Netscape browser of version 4 and higher,  you need to check this on the server side.   This technique works only with Netscape Navigator 4 and higher versions.       Handling Dynamic Variable-Names   At some stage of your JavaScript programming career, you might find a situation in which you  need to use a variable whose name is not fixed. Can JavaScript handle variable variable-names?  Yesâwhen the variable name may be dynamic, the eval function is certainly useful.   The code in Listing 22.11 presents an example that uses a variable whose name must change.   Listing 22.11 Handling a Variable variable-name       var n0 = "train";   var n1 = "abc4";   var n2 = 2;     for  var i=0; i<3; i++  {    alert eval "n" + i  ;   }       Without the eval function, the code in Listing 22.11 would have to be written in a less efficient  way, as given in Listing 22.12.   Listing 22.12 Rewriting the Code in Listing 22.11 Without the eval Function       var n0 = "train";       466      var n1 = "abc4";   var n2 = 2;     alert n0 ;   alert n1 ;   alert n2 ;           Summary   This technique works with Netscape Navigator version 2 and higher, and Internet Explorer version  3 and higher.   In this chapter, you have seen several techniques that can help you with your client-side coding.  You now know how to check to make sure the user browser supports JavaScript and the  JavaScript feature is turned on, and you understand how to include a collection of JavaScript  functions in a file. Additionally, you discovered how important the fourth generation of the  browser is and saw how to use the eval function to handle variables whose names can change  throughout the page.   These techniques may seem simple, but they constitute the most important technique collection  you should know if you want to consider yourself a serious web developer.      467      Chapter 23. Redirection   Redirecting the user to a different page is a useful technique frequently used in web programming.  For example, you might want to create a splash screen effectâdisplaying the company logo for a  few seconds and then redirect the user to the main page. Or, you might want to send cookies to the  browser by writing the cookies in the HTTP response, plus the bit that tells the browser to fetch  another pageâeffectively creating the cookies in one go. The two examples mentioned redirect  the user without user interaction. In other situations, you might want the redirection to happen  after the user performs an action.   This chapter presents several techniques for page redirection, including a discussion of  anticipating a failed redirection  which can happen for a number of reasons . Failed redirection, in  fact, should be the first thing you take into account when using a redirection technique.       Anticipating Failed Redirection   When automatic redirection should take place without user intervention, be sure to provide users  with a link to click in case the redirection fails. Redirection could fail, for example, if the browser  does not support JavaScript or it supports JavaScript, but the feature is turned off. When the  redirection is to create a cookie on the browser, it could also fail if the browser does not accept  cookies.   For every redirection attempt, always take precaution by sending a link that the user can manually  click in case the redirection fails. For example, Listing 23.1 is a page that provides such a link.   Listing 23.1 A Page that Anticipates a Failed Redirection            Anticipating failed redirection             code for redirection here               Click  here    if you do not get redirected automatically.              Using the Refresh Meta Tag   The easiest way to redirect a page that has been displayed for a period of time is to use the meta  tag. The meta tag for redirection takes the following form:       where x is the number of seconds the browser will wait before redirection occurs.      468                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       For example, the script in Listing 23.2 redirects the browser to http:  www.newriders.com after 5  seconds.   Listing 23.2 Redirection with the Meta Tag            Using the meta tag to redirect the user                This will be redirected to another page.   Click  here  if you do not    get redirected automatically.           If you set x to 0, the redirection will happen without delay.   Using a non-zero value for x, you can create a splash screen that is displayed for x seconds before  the browser gets redirected to another page. Listing 23.3 gives the code for a splash screen that  gets displayed for 3 seconds before the user is redirected to somewhere else.   Listing 23.3 A Splash Screen            Using the meta tag to redirect the user                Welcome to Brainy Software               This technique works in Netscape Navigator 3 and higher and Internet Explorer 4 and higher.       Using the location Object       location=newURL       An alternative way to redirect the user to another page is to use the location object in JavaScript.  The syntax is simple, as follows:   where newURL is the new URL to which the browser will be redirected. Listing 23.4 gives an  example of redirection using the location object.   Listing 23.4 Redirection Using the location Object           469           Redirection using the location object         location='http:  www.newriders.com';               This will be redirected to another page.   Click  here  if you do not    get redirected automatically.           To redirect the user after a few seconds  for example, to create a splash screen  use the setTimeout  method with the location object. The syntax is as follows:   setTimeout "location='anotherURL'", y ;   where y is the number of milliseconds before the user is redirected to anotherURL. Listing 23.5  redirects the user to www.newriders.com after two seconds.   Listing 23.5 A Splash Screen Using the location Object            A splash screen using the location object           setTimeout "location='http:  www.newriders.com'", 2000 ;               Greeting               This technique works with Netscape Navigator 2 and higher and Internet Explorer 3 and higher.       Going Back to the Previous Page   Sometimes you might want to provide a link for the user to go back to the previous page. For  example, you might have an entry form and a page that displays an error message if one of the  user inputs is invalid. From the Error page, you can provide a link that can be clicked to go back to  the entry form.   The history object has two methods that can be used to go back to the previous page: the back  method and the go method. The syntax for using the history object to go back to the previous page  is as follows:   history.back     or      470      history.go -1    For example, the code in Listing 23.6 provides a link for the user to go back to the previous page.   Listing 23.6 Going Back to the Previous Page            Going back to the previous page            The password you typed in is not long enough.     Please  go back  to correct  it.           Using the history object's go method, you can pass any negative number to go back n pages before  the current page. The code in Listing 23.7 serves as an example of a page that has a link to bring  the user 3 pages back.   Listing 23.7 Going n Pages Back            Going n pages back             Click  here    to go back the the beginning of the entry form go back.           This technique works with Netscape Navigator 2 and higher and Internet Explorer 3 and higher.       Moving Forward   You may have guessed that you can use the history object's go method to move forward. Yes, you  can. The secret is to pass a positive number as the argument of the go method. The code in Listing  23.8 provides a page with a link to move forward.   Listing 23.8 Moving Forward            Moving forward            Click  here    to move forward.              471      Note that you don't need to use the plus sign  +  in front of the number for the parameter to the go  method.   This technique works with Netscape Navigator 2 and higher and Internet Explorer 3 and higher.       Navigation with a SELECT Element   From the current page, you might want to let the user choose a new destination, such as the  product they want to review or the branch office of your corporate they are interested in. You can  use a SELECT element for this purpose. For example, the code in Listing 23.9 uses a SELECT  element to list one of the regional offices. The user can click an option to get redirected to the  URL linked to that option.   Listing 23.9 Selecting a New Destination            Navigating to a new world            Please select one of our regional offices                Select a destination     Asia     Europe     North America     Australasia                    The code in Listing 23.9 uses the onChange event to change the value of the location object. The  syntax is as follows.   location="newURL"   where newURL is an option value of the following form:   this.options[this.selectedIndex].value   The this keyword refers to the current object, which is the SELECT element. options is an array of  options. In Listing 23.9 options has four elements: asia.html, europe.html, northAmerica.html, and  australasia.html. To select a value, you just need to pass an index to the brackets [ â¦ ]. Thus, the  following will return the first element in the options array:   this.options[0].value   In the case of the code in Listing 23.9, it will return asia.html.      472   Finally, this.selectedIndex returns the index number of the option clicked by the user. Therefore, if  the user clicks Australasia from the SELECT element, this.options[this.selectedIndex].value will  be translated into australasia.html.   This technique works with Netscape Navigator 2 and higher and Internet Explorer 3 and higher.          Summary   In this chapter you have learned several tips for both automatic and manual redirection. Automatic  redirection redirects the user to another URL or another page without the user intervention,  whereas manual redirection redirects the user when the user does something, such as clicking a  button or a hyperlink.   You have also learned how to anticipate failed automatic redirection by providing a link the user  can click to manually go to another page. This anticipation tip should be used whenever you use  automatic redirection. The automatic redirection can be used to display a splash screen or to send  cookies to the browser.   For manual redirection, you normally use the go or back methods of the history object.      473      Chapter 24. Client-Side Input Validation   When you apply client-side validation, you ensure that the values of form elements are valid  before the form is submitted. From the server's perspective, this means reduced workload because  it does not have to return the user to the form to correct a value. For users, this means a much  faster response because they get an instant warning when a form entry is not correct.   When you use client-side validation, be aware that some users have their JavaScript capability  turned off, and some clever people can bypass your client-side validation entirely. Normally you  need to perform server-side input validation to check for those conditions. Using client-side input  validation still makes the overall system more scalable, however, because in most cases server- side validation needs only to perform a last check for input validity.   On the client side, there are two types of input validation: at the form level and at the field- or  form- element level. With form-level validation, you perform a check on every form element just  before the form is submitted. You do this by writing an event handler for the form's onSubmit  event, as follows:       In the preceding code, validate   is a JavaScript function that does the input validation.   With form-level validation, you perform the validation right after a user finishes entering a value  for that form element. If the element is a TEXT box, which is the case for most forms, you can  write a handler for the onBlur or onChange event of that TEXT element. The onChange event is  triggered whenever a user makes a change to the text in a TEXT element and then either tabs or  clicks out of the element. The onBlur event is triggered when the focus moves from the TEXT  element to another object, such as when the user clicks another element.   For example, the following line of code checks the value of the ProductQuantity TEXT element  every time its value changes:   <INPUT TYPE=TEXT Name=ProductQuantity   onChange='isNumeric document.forms[0].ProductQuantity.value '>   In the preceding code, isNumeric is a custom function that accepts a string parameter and checks  whether the string parameter is a valid numeric value.   This chapter begins with helpful JavaScript functions that you can copy and paste to any of your  forms. You even can bundle everything in a .js file if you use these functions often enough.   Note   All the techniques in this chapter can be used with Netscape Navigator version 2.0 and  later, Internet Explorer version 3.0 and higher.     The isEmpty Function   The isEmpty function tests whether the string parameter passed to it is a null or a zero-length  string. It returns true if the string parameter is a null or a blank string; otherwise, it returns false.  The isEmpty function is shown in Listing 24.1.      474      Listing 24.1 The isEmpty Function       function isEmpty str  {    if  str == null  str == ""        return true;     return false;   }       The most common application of this function is making sure a user does not leave a TEXT  element blank. Listing 24.2 demonstrates the use of isEmpty. The code is for a form with two  input elements: UserName and Password. When the user submits the form, the function validate  uses the isEmpty function to check the two elements. The form submission will be cancelled if  either one of the two boxes is empty.   Listing 24.2 Using the isEmpty Function            Using the isEmpty Function        function isEmpty str  {    if  str == null  str == ""        return true;     return false;   }     function validate userName, password  {    if  isEmpty userName   {      alert 'User name must have a value' ;       return false;     }     if  isEmpty password   {      alert 'Password must have a value' ;       return false;     }     return true;   }               <FORM ACTION=Login.jsp METHOD=POST     OnSubmit="return validate this.UserName.value,       this.Password.value ;">   User Name:         Password:                            The trim Function      475      When validating user input, you want to make sure that the user does not accidentally  or  deliberately  type leading or trailing spaces that have to be removed on the server. The code in  Listing 24.3 provides a function that trims the leading and trailing spaces.   Listing 24.3 The trim Function       function trim str  {    while  str.charAt str.length - 1  == " "        str = str.substring 0, str.length - 1 ;     while  str.charAt 0  == " "        str = str.substring 1, str.length ;     return str;   }       The trim function accepts one parameterâstr, which is the string that needs to be trimmed. The  brains of this function are the two while loops. The first while loop continuously checks the last  character of the string and truncates the last character if it is a white space, as you see in the  following:   while  str.charAt str.length - 1  == " "        str = str.substring 0, str.length - 1 ;   The second while loop checks the first character in the string, removes the first character if it is a  space, and shifts the rest of the string one character to the left, as follows:   while  str.charAt 0  == " "        str = str.substring 1, str.length ;   The function then returns the trimmed string:   return str;   You might wonder if you need to check against null being passed to the function. The answer is  no, as long as the trim function is used to check the value of a form element. The value of a form  element will never be null even if a user does not type anything in it. If a TEXT element is left  untouched by the user, it has the value of a blank string.   If you are going to pass a variable to the trim function, you need to modify it to check for null.  Otherwise, it will generate an error and cause the JavaScript execution to stop. The code in Listing  24.3 is the modified trim function that can safely handle a string variable. The code in Listing 24.3  is safe only for processing form elements.   Listing 24.4 Another Version of the trim Function that Can Handle a String Variable  Safely       function trim str  {    if  str != null  {      while  str.charAt str.length - 1  == " "          str = str.substring 0, str.length - 1 ;       while  str.charAt 0  == " "          str = str.substring 1, str.length ;     }     return str;   }       476   Note that the trim function in Listing 24.4 first checks whether the parameter is null. This is not  done by the trim function in Listing 24.3 because a form element is never null.              The trimAll Function   The trim function works with the form's TEXT input element, but it does not work for elements  that can accept carriage return characters, such as a TEXTAREA. The trimAll in Listing 24.5  extends the trim function to trim any leading or trailing blank space, carriage return character, new  line character, or tab character.   Listing 24.5 The trimAll Function   function trimAll str  {    if  str != null  {      while  str.length > 0 &&         "\n\r\t ".indexOf str.charAt str.length - 1   != -1          str = str.substring 0, str.length - 1 ;       while  str.length > 0 &&         "\n\r\t ".indexOf str.charAt 0   != -1          str = str.substring 1, str.length ;     }     return str;   }   The first while loop first makes sure that the string str is not empty. It then creates a string "\n\r\t  "and uses the indexOf function to check whether the last character of str matches any of the  characters in the string "\n\r\t ".If there is a match, indexOf returns the matching character position  in "\n\r\t "; otherwise, it returns -1. Note that in JavaScript \n represents a new line character, \r  represents a carriage return, and \t is a tab character.   The second while loop does the same thing with the first character in str.       The isPositiveInteger Function   The isPositiveInteger function returns true only if all the characters that compose the string  argument passed to it are numeric charactersâthat is, 0 to 9 inclusive. The function loops through  the string argument from the first character to the last. It compares each character with a pattern  and stops and returns false if it finds a character that does not match any composing character of  the pattern.   Listing 24.6 presents the isPositiveInteger function. If you are using the function in a form, you  also should trim the string you want to check before feeding it to the isPositiveInteger function.   Listing 24.6 The isPositiveInteger Function           477      function isPositiveInteger str  {    var pattern = "0123456789"     var i = 0;     do {      var pos = 0;       for  var j=0; j<pattern.length; j++          if  str.charAt i  == pattern.charAt j   {          pos = 1;           break;         }       i++;     } while  pos == 1 && i<str.length      if  pos == 0        return false;     return true;   }       In addition to validating a positive numeric value, you can use the isPositiveInteger function to  check a ZIP code.   You can easily modify the isPositiveInteger to create similar functions by changing the value of  the variable pattern. Examples include the isValidPhoneNumber and isMoney functions, which  are described in the following sections.     The isValidPhoneNumber Function   The isValidPhoneNumber function is derived from the isPositiveInteger function and works in a  similar manner. The only difference between the two functions is the value of the pattern string.  Listing 24.7 illustrates the isValidPhoneNumber function.   Listing 24.7 The isValidPhoneNumber Function       function isValidPhoneNumber str  {    var pattern = "0123456789  -"     var i = 0;     do {      var pos = 0;       for  var j=0; j<pattern.length; j++          if  str.charAt i  == pattern.charAt j   {  pos = 1;         break;         }       i++;     } while  pos == 1 && i<str.length      if  pos == 0        return false;     return true;   }       Note      478                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       Note that the isValidPhoneNumber function only validates that the string is comprised of  valid characters. It does not verify the validity of the phone number itself.   The preceding isValidPhoneNumber function checks only the string input based on a pattern. It  does not, for example, check that the " "character appears before " ". First, the validity of phone  numbers depends on the country. Secondly, checking phone number validity requires you to draw  certain rules that need to apply. The more complex the rule is, the harder it is to create a validating  function. The isValidPhoneNumber given here therefore provides only for a basic validating  function. You should extend this function based on your need.   Note that you can perform string checking more easily using regular expressions. For example, the  following function checks whether the string input has the format of  xx yy, where both xx and yy  are any number of numeric characters and both the " " and " " characters are optional. Therefore,  using the following function,  999 5565656 is valid, but  ab 8989898 is not:   function isValidPhoneNumber str  {    var re = new RegExp  ^\ ?\d*\ ?\d*$  ;     if  re.test str         return true;     else       return false;   }   The problem with regular expressions is that browsers prior to version 4.0 of Internet Explorer and  Netscape Navigator do not recognize them. Additionally, compatibility between the two types of  browser is not guaranteed. For instance, the preceding function returns true in IE 5.5 for str equals   121 888. In Navigator 4.7, however, the same function with the same input returns false.       The isMoney Function   The isMoney function, which derives from the isPositiveInteger function, checks the string  parameter passed to it. The function returns true if the string parameter is a valid monetary unit;  otherwise, it returns false.   An example of the isMoney function is presented in Listing 24.8.   Listing 24.8 The isMoney Function       function isMoney str  {    var pattern = "0123456789,."     var i = 0;     do {      var pos = 0;       for  var j=0; j<pattern.length; j++          if  str.charAt i  == pattern.charAt j   {  pos = 1;           break;         }       i++;     } while  pos == 1 && i<str.length      if  pos == 0        return false;       479             now make sure that the decimal point, if any,        only appears one and at the  str.length-3         position, so that the valid format is xxx.yy        the following statement also returns        false if there are 2 or more decimal points    pos = str.indexOf "." ;     if  pos != -1 && pos != str.length-3        return false          now check that if comma exists, the        format must be xxx,xxx,xxx,...,xxx     if  pos == -1        pos = str.length;         while  str.lastIndexOf ",", pos-1  != -1  {      if  str.lastIndexOf ",", pos-1  != pos-4          return false;       else         pos -= 4;     }     return true;   }       One thing to remember when you validate a monetary unit string is that even though a comma can  be in the string, you must remove the comma when you pass the value if you don't want to have to  remove it on the server. The removeComma function in Listing 24.9 can do the job.   Listing 24.9 The removeComma Function       function removeComma str  {    var result = "";     for  var i=0; i<str.length; i++        if  str.charAt i  != ","          result += str.charAt i ;     return result;   }   The removeComma function checks the whole string for the comma character and recomposes  result from str. The variable result is free of commas.       The isUSDate and isOZDate Functions   Another important data type that needs attention is the date. The various date formats always add  complexity to your code, either on the client or the server side. When you ask a user to enter a date  on the client side, it's a good idea to have three SELECT boxes with valid options: one for the day,  one for the month, and one for the year. This way, the date entered will always be valid because  the user can't enter any value beyond those given in the SELECT boxes.   If your design does not permit you to use the previous technique and you can have only one text  box for the day, the month, and the year, the isUSDate and isOZDate functions can help. OZ      480      stands for aussie or Australia, one of the countries whose valid date is dd mm yyyy. Both  functions assume that a valid date must be 10 characters long and have two backslash characters  as separa-tors. As a result, if the day or the month of the date is only one character long, it must be  padded with a zero character. For example, May 5, 2002 must be written as 05 05 2002.   The difference between the two functions lies in the order of the day and the month. The isUSDate  function accepts a date as valid if the format is mm dd yyyy. The isOZDate function, on the other  hand, accepts a date as valid date in the dd mm yyyy format.   A function to check the validity of a date is always made more complex by the fact that a normal  year has 365 days, while a leap year has 366 days. Keep in mind that a leap year is one that meets  the following mathematical criteria:          It is evenly divisible by 400.  If it is not evenly divisible by 400, it is evenly divisible by 4 but not evenly divisible by  100.   Therefore, the year 2000 is a leap year because it is divisible by 400, but 1900 is not a leap year  because it is divisible by 100. Other examples of leap years are 1980, 1984, and 1988, because  they are divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100. Listing 24.10 presents the isUSDate function, and  Listing 24.11 presents the isOZDate function.   Listing 24.10 The isUSDate Function       function isUSDate str  {    if  str.length != 10  str.charAt 2  != " "  str.charAt 5  !=  " "        !isPositiveInteger str.substring 0,2  +       str.substring 3,5  + str.substring 6,10          return false;     var d = str.substring 3,5  - 0;     var m = str.substring 0,2  - 0;     var y = str.substring 6,10  - 0;     if  d == 0  m == 0  y == 0        return false;       if  m>12  return false;     if  m == 1  m == 3  m == 5  m == 7  m == 8  m == 10  m  == 12        var dmax = 31;     else       if  m == 4  m == 6  m == 9  m == 11  dmax = 30;       else         if   y%400 == 0    y%4 == 0 && y%100 != 0   dmax = 29;         else dmax = 28;     if  d>dmax  return false;     return true;   }       Listing 24.11 The isOZDate Function       function isOZDate str  {    if  str.length != 10  str.charAt 2  != " "  str.charAt 5  !=  " "        !isPositiveInteger str.substring 0,2  +       481          str.substring 3,5  + str.substring 6,10          return false;     var d = str.substring 0,2  - 0;     var m = str.substring 3,5  - 0;     var y = str.substring 6,10  - 0;     if  d == 0  m == 0  y == 0        return false;       if  m>12  return false;     if  m == 1  m == 3  m == 5  m == 7  m == 8  m == 10  m  == 12        var dmax = 31;     else       if  m == 4  m == 6  m == 9  m == 11  dmax = 30;       else         if   y%400 == 0    y%4 == 0 && y%100 != 0   dmax = 29;         else dmax = 28;     if  d>dmax  return false;     return true;   }       The isUSDate function first checks whether the variable str is 10 characters long and whether the  third and fifth characters are forward slashes    . The function also checks that the rest of the  characters are integers 0 to 9 inclusive, as you see here:   if  str.length != 10  str.charAt 2  != " "  str.charAt 5  != " "       !isPositiveInteger str.substring 0,2  +     str.substring 3,5  + str.substring 6,10      Note that the isUSDate function uses the isPositiveInteger function in Listing 24.6 to check  whether all characters except the third and fifth characters are numbers. When you use the  isUSDate function, you also must copy the isPositiveInteger function.   The function then extracts the day, month, and year components from str and stores them in  variables d, m, and y, respectively:   var d = str.substring 3,5  - 0;   var m = str.substring 0,2  - 0;   var y = str.substring 6,10  - 0;   The result of the substring operations for d, m, and y have 0 subtracted from them, forcing them to  convert to numbers. Alternatively, you can use the parseInt function to convert a string into an  integer.   The function then uses the following line to check that the value of the month does not exceed 12:   if  m>12  return false;   The number of days in January, March, May, July, August, October, and December is 31, so the  maximum value for d is 31, as you see in the following:   if  m == 1  m == 3  m == 5  m == 7  m == 8  m == 10  m ==  12        var dmax = 31;   For April, June, September, and November, however, the maximum number of days is 30:      482      if  m == 4  m == 6  m == 9  m == 11  dmax = 30;   The month of February is most difficult. In a leap year, the number of days is 29, but in non-leap  years, the number of days is 28. The code for this is as follows:   if   y%400 == 0    y%4 == 0 && y%100 != 0   dmax = 29;     else dmax = 28;   The isOZDate function works similarly, except that the day and month are reversed.       Converting Date Formats   If you happen to use different date formats on the client and server sides, you need to convert your  dates upon submitting the form to avoid the need for processing on the server. For example, if you  want to publish your web site in the United Kingdom, but the data will go directly to a server in  the United States, you need to validate the dates using the isOZDate function and convert them to  a U.S. format upon form submittal. If you are never sure where the client is located, however, use  the three select boxes to force the date to have a specific format; that is, either dd mm yyyy or  mm dd yyyy.   Again, two functions are provided here. The convertToUSDate function converts an already valid  date in dd mm yyyy format to the mm dd yyyy format. The convertToOZDate function does the  reverse.   You'll find the convertToUSDate function in Listing 24.12 and the convertToOZDate function in  Listing 24.13.   Listing 24.12 The convertToUSDate Function       function convertToUSDate str  {       maybe you should validate that this IsOZDate first?     return  str.substring 3,5  + " " + str.substring 0,2  + " " +  str.substring 6,10  ;   }       Listing 24.13 The convertToOZDate Function       function convertToOZDate str  {       validate that this isUSDate first?     return  str.substring 3,5  + " " + str.substring 0,2  + " " +   str.substring 6,10  ;   }          Data Type Conversion: String to Numeric      483      To understand the importance of data type conversion in JavaScript, consider the code in Listing  24.14.   Listing 24.14 A Logic Error Resulting from Not Understanding the Importance of  Data Conversion            A logic error        function getTotalCost   {      var freight = 2;     var totalCost =  freight + document.forms[0].price.value;     alert totalCost ;   result: 2300   }                         <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE="Get Total Cost"  onClick="javascript:getTotalCost  ">               You might think the result of the getTotalCost function would be 302  from 300 + 2 ; however,  the result is 2300. What happened? Whatever is entered into a TEXT element is considered a  string, even though all the typed characters are digits 0 to 9. When you perform the + operation  with freight with a value of 2, a string concatenation is performed rather than a mathematical  addition operation. To correct the problem, you need to explicitly or implicitly convert the string  to a numeric type.   Most JavaScript textbooks teach developers to use the parseInt and parseFloat functions. The  difference between an integer and a floating-point number in JavaScript is that integers are always  whole numbers, with no decimal point or numbers to the right of a decimal. In contrast, a floating- point number can have fractional value to the right of the decimal. JavaScript math operations  don't differentiate between integers and floating-point numbers, however.   Consider the result of the parseInt function:   parseInt "98" ;      result = 98   parseInt "98.87" ;    result = 98   The parseFloat function returns an integer if it can; otherwise, it returns a floating-point number:   parseFloat "98" ;     result = 98   parseFloat "98.87" ;    result = 98.87   To get the expected result, put the string in the bracket and add - 0  minus 0  to force the string to  change to numeric.   Applying string-to-numeric data conversion, the getTotalCost function in Listing 24.14 is  rewritten in Listing 24.15.   Listing 24.15 The Correct getTotalCost Function      484          function getTotalCost   {    var freight = 2;     var totalCost =  freight +  document.forms[0].price.value - 0 ;     alert totalCost ;   result: 302   }       Note that the use of the minus sign  -  to force a string to convert to a number can be used as the  alternative to the parseInt or parseFloat function. This approach makes your function less readable,  however.       Data Type Conversion: Numeric to String   You'll sometimes need to convert a number into a string. For example, after doing a mathematical  calculation, you want to pass the result to a format function that performs different operations for  a number argument and a string argument. If you want the string operation to take place, you must  convert your number into a string prior to passing it to the format function. This is done by  concatenating the number with a blank string. The code in Listing 24.16 presents an example of  number-to-string conversion.   Listing 24.16 Number to String Conversion       function toString n  {    return "" + n;   }    * note   "" + 98;    result = "98"    "" + 98 .length;    result = 2   *           Using the Validation Functions   This section does not provide a tip, but rather offers an example of how to use the validation  functions in a form. Listing 24.17 is an HTML page with a form containing three input elements:  Company, ProductID, and ProductQuantity. As you may have guessed, this form enables  customers to order products. The Company, ProductID, and ProductQuantity boxes must not be  left empty. In addition, ProductQuantity can contain only a number. Note that the HTML page  includes a   section with three functions: trim, isPositiveInteger, and validateForm. The  validateForm function is assigned as the handler for the form's onSubmit event. It is called just  before the form is submitted. The validateForm function will return true only if the three boxes  have valid values. If the validateForm function returns false, the form is not submitted. If one of  the three form elements has an invalid value, an alert box is issued and the focus shifts to the box  whose value is invalid.   Listing 24.17 A Client-Side Input Validation Example           485           Form Validation          function trim str  {    while  str.charAt str.length - 1  == " "        str = str.substring 0, str.length - 1 ;     while  str.charAt 0  == " "        str = str.substring 1, str.length ;     return str;   }     function isPositiveInteger str  {    var pattern = "0123456789"     var i = 0;     do {      var pos = 0;       for  var j=0; j<pattern.length; j++          if  str.charAt i  == pattern.charAt j   {  pos = 1;           break;         }       i++;     } while  pos == 1 && i<str.length      if  pos == 0        return false;     return true;   }     function validateForm theForm  {    if  trim theForm.Company.value  == ''  {      alert 'Please enter a value in the "Company" box' ;       theForm.Company.focus  ;       return false;     }     if  trim theForm.ProductID.value  == ''  {      alert 'Please enter a value in the "ProductID" box' ;       theForm.ProductID.focus  ;       return false;     }     if  trim theForm.ProductQuantity.value  == ''  {      alert 'Please enter a value in the "Product Quantity" box' ;       theForm.ProductQuantity.focus  ;       return false;     }     if  !isPositiveInteger trim theForm.ProductQuantity.value    {      alert 'Please enter a number only in the "Product Quantity" box' ;       theForm.ProductQuantity.focus  ;       return false;     }     return true;   }                 <FORM METHOD=POST ACTION=buy.jsp onSubmit='return  validateForm this '>              Company:        486                         Product ID:                       Product Quantity:                                                Figure 24.1 shows the form and the alert box that appear when a value is not valid.   Figure 24.1. Checking the validity of user input at the client side.       Summary      Client-side input validation is important for reducing server workload and responding quickly to  clients. In this chapter, you learned some tips that are useful for checking the validity of client  input, including checking strings, numbers, and dates. You also learned data type conversion  techniques.      487      Chapter 25. Working with Client-Side Cookies   Chapter 5, "Session Management," examined the use of cookies for session management. In this  chapter, we look at cookies in more detail, especially in regards to manipulating cookies at the  client side  for example, in a browser .   To recap, a cookie is a small piece of information that is stored by the web browser in a client's  machine or kept in the machine's memory. This information is sent to the server each time the  client requests a page from where the information originated. Cookies are normally used to retain  state or information in the stateless HTTP protocol.   Some users, however, prefer not to accept cookies because they don't want anything from the  server written to their computer. Users can configure their web browsers not to receive cookies.  The major browsers do not handle cookies exactly the same. Netscape Navigator allows the user  to choose to only accept cookies that get sent back to the originating server. Internet Explorer  distinguishes between cookies that only stay in memory  per-session cookies  and cookies that  live after the browser is closed  stored in the computer .   What does this mean to you as a web developer? It means it is critical for you to test the user's  browser for acceptance of cookies before allowing the user to enter a cookies-rich area of your  web site.   This chapter presents tips for working with cookies, including how to create, delete, and edit a  cookieâboth on the server side and the client side.       Creating Cookies with a   Tag   You can create and read cookies on both the server side and the client side. On the client side,  JavaScript is used. When you need to create cookies on the server side, you need Java in servlets  or JSP pages, to write the cookie on the HTTP response. However, cookies can also be created  using a   tag.   Creating cookies with a   tag is very easy. One advantage of using the   tag is  that you can use an HTML page to create your cookies. This is in contrast with the technique  described in Chapter 5, where you learned how to create cookies by instantiating the  javax.servlet.http.Cookie class.   Another advantage of using the   tag is that it still works even if JavaScript is turned off  in the user's browser. The drawback is that some old browsers might not understand    tags. However, some web servers translate the   tag directly into the HTTP header so that  the browser does not have to translate it by itself. That said, the   tag is the best way to  create a cookie.   Listing 25.1 and Listing 25.2 present examples of using the   tag to create a cookie in the  user's web browser. The code in Listing 25.1 uses an expiration date so that the cookie survives  the user closing the browser, and it is saved to disk  until it expires . The code in Listing 25.2  creates a cookie that is only valid for the current session and is erased upon the user closing the  web browser.   Listing 25.1 Creating a Cookie that Is Valid Until a Certain Date      488                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®                Creating a cookie that is valid until a certain date   <META   HTTP-EQUIV="Set-Cookie" CONTENT="userId=678;expires=Wednesday, 26- Dec-01 16:00:00 GMT;   path= ">           Unless you set your browser to not accept cookies, a cookie called  userId with a value of   678 has been created for you.           Listing 25.2 Creating a Cookie that Is Only Valid Until the Browser Is Closed            Creating a cookie that is valid for this session only   <META   HTTP-EQUIV="Set-Cookie" CONTENT="ProductID=2x3;">           Unless you set your browser not to accept cookies, this page creates  a cookie called   ProductID with a value of "2x3". The cookie won't be written to your  hard drive. It lives   until the browser is closed.              Creating Cookies with document.cookie   On the client side, JavaScript is used to create cookies. There are several ways to do this. The  easiest way is to use document.cookie. The following is the syntax for creating a cookie this way:   document.cookie = "cookieName=cookieValue     [; expires=timeInGMTString]     [; path=pathName]     [; domain=domainName]     [; secure]"   The code in Listing 25.3 creates a cookie called Quantity with a value of 7 that lives as long as the  browser is open.   Listing 25.3 Creating a Cookie with document.cookie            Creating a cookie with document.cookie        document.cookie="Quantity=7";                   489      This page creates a cookie on the client side.   Make sure that your browser is set to accept cookies.                Creating Cookies with the setCookie Function   The preceding technique creates cookies when a user loads the page. However, sometimes you  want to interactively create cookies on the client side. For example, you'll want to create a cookie  when your user chooses to buy something in your online store web application. The setCookie  function in Listing 25.4 is handy for creating a cookie on the browser. It has six arguments, but  only the name and value arguments need to be present. For any optional argument that's not  present, a default value is assigned to that argument.   Note   The setCookie function in Listing 25.4 and the getCookie function in Listing 25.8 can be  found on the Internet. I am not sure who the cool guy was who wrote these functions the  first time.   Listing 25.4 The setCookie Function       function setCookie name, value, expires, path, domain, secure  {    document.cookie = name + "=" + escape value  +         expires  ? "; expires=" + expires.toGMTString   : ""  +         path  ? "; path=" + path : ""  +         domain  ? "; domain=" + domain : ""  +         secure  ? "; secure" : "" ;   }       The code in Listing 25.5 is an HTML file that uses the setCookie function to create a cookie if the  user wants to. The HTML page has a form with a button and a TEXT element called UserID.  When the user clicks the button, a cookie called UserID is created. The value of the cookie is the  value typed into the UserID TEXT element.   Listing 25.5 Using the setCookie Function            Using the setCookie function        function setCookie name, value, expires, path, domain, secure  {    document.cookie = name + "=" + escape value  +         expires  ? "; expires=" + expires.toGMTString   : ""  +         path  ? "; path=" + path : ""  +         domain  ? "; domain=" + domain : ""  +         secure  ? "; secure" : "" ;   }               Type your user id, and then click the button below.       490      A cookie will be created for you.           User ID:         <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE="Create Cookie"   onClick='setCookie "UserID", document.forms[0].UserID.value ;'>               In Listing 25.5, the cookie exists until the user closes the browser. If you want to set the expiration  date so that the cookie can last longer than the current browser session, you need to pass a date as  the argument expires. However, as a result of a bug in some browsers, you need to use the fixDate  to "repair" your date before it is passed to the setCookie function. The fixDate function is  presented in Listing 25.6.   Listing 25.6 The fixDate Function          date - any instance of the Date object      hand all instances of the Date object to this function for  "repairs"   function fixDate date  {    var base = new Date 0 ;     var skew = base.getTime  ;     if  skew > 0  date.setTime date.getTime   - skew ;   }       The example in Listing 25.7 sets a cookie called authorizationLevel with the value of 2 and an  expiration date of one year after it is set. Notice how the date is repaired before being passed to the  function.   Listing 25.7 An Example that Creates a Cookie with an Expiration Date            Using the setCookie function          function setCookie name, value, expires, path, domain, secure  {    document.cookie = name + "=" + escape value  +         expires  ? "; expires=" + expires.toGMTString   : ""  +         path  ? "; path=" + path : ""  +         domain  ? "; domain=" + domain : ""  +         secure  ? "; secure" : "" ;   }     function fixDate date  {      var base = new Date 0 ;       var skew = base.getTime  ;       if  skew > 0  date.setTime date.getTime   - skew ;   }     var expiryDate = new Date  ;   fixDate expiryDate ;   expiryDate.setTime expiryDate.getTime   + 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 ;   setCookie "authorizationLevel", 2, expiryDate ;         491                  A cookie which is valid for a year has been created for this page.                Reading Cookies on the Browser   The function getCookie provided in Listing 25.8 has one argument: name. This argument is the  name of the cookie whose value you want to retrieve.   Listing 25.8 The getCookie Function       function getCookie name  {    var cName = name + "=";     var dc = document.cookie;     if  dc.length>0  {      begin = dc.indexOf cName ;       if  begin != -1  {        begin += cName.length;         end = dc.indexOf ";", begin ;         if  end == -1  end = dc.length;           return unescape dc.substring begin,end  ;       }     }     return null;   }       An example is given in Listing 25.9. The HTML page contains buttons that the user can click to  write and read cookies.   Listing 25.9 Writing and Reading Cookies            Writing and Reading Cookies          function setCookie name, value, expires, path, domain, secure  {    document.cookie = name + "=" + escape value  +         expires  ? "; expires=" + expires.toGMTString   : ""  +         path  ? "; path=" + path : ""  +         domain  ? "; domain=" + domain : ""  +         secure  ? "; secure" : "" ;   }     function getCookie name  {    var cName = name + "=";     var dc = document.cookie;     if  dc.length>0  {      begin = dc.indexOf cName ;       if  begin != -1  {      492            begin += cName.length;         end = dc.indexOf ";", begin ;         if  end == -1  end = dc.length;           return unescape dc.substring begin,end  ;       }     }     return null;   }                 Type in your user id, and then click the Create Cookie button.   A cookie will be created for you.           User ID:         <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE="Create Cookie"   onClick='setCookie "UserID", document.forms[0].UserID.value '>       Click the Read Cookie button to display the cookie.   <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON VALUE="Read Cookie"   onClick='alert getCookie "UserID"  '>                  Deleting a Cookie on the Browser   You don't really delete a cookie, you just make it expire by setting the expiration date to the first  second of the year 1970, as in the deleteCookie function in Listing 25.10. Note that the function  uses the getCookie function from Listing 25.8, so you need to paste the getCookie function in your  page as well.   Listing 25.10 Deleting a Cookie       function deleteCookie  name, path, domain  {    if  getCookie name   {      document.cookie = name + "=" +         path == null  ? "" : "; path=" + path  +         domain == null  ? "" : "; domain=" + domain  +       "; expires=Thu, 01-Jan-70 00:00:01 GMT";     }   }     function getCookie name  {    var cName = name + "=";     var dc = document.cookie;     if  dc.length>0  {      begin = dc.indexOf cName ;       if  begin != -1  {        begin += cName.length;         end = dc.indexOf ";", begin ;         if  end == -1  end = dc.length;           return unescape dc.substring begin,end  ;       493          }     }     return null;   }       The deleteCookie function in Listing 25.10 first uses the getCookie function to check if the cookie  you want to delete is already created. If the getCookie function returns false, the cookie you want  to delete does not exist. The function then exits gracefully. If the cookie does exist, its expiration  date is set to the first second in January 1970, which makes it expire straight away.       Checking If the Browser Can Accept Cookies Using  JavaScript   This section outlines the simplest way of testing a browser's acceptance of cookies. Using  JavaScript, the page simply creates a cookie called "test" with the value "OK". It then tries to read  back the cookie immediately after the cookie is created. Failure to find the cookie means that the  browser does not accept cookies.   Listing 25.11 presents an example of an HTML page that uses this technique.   Listing 25.11 Checking If the Browser Can Accept Cookies Using JavaScript               document.cookie="test=OK";     function getCookie name  {    var cName = name + "=";     var dc = document.cookie;     if  dc.length>0  {      begin = dc.indexOf cName ;       if  begin != -1  {        begin += cName.length;         end = dc.indexOf ";", begin ;         if  end == -1  end = dc.length;           return unescape dc.substring begin,end  ;       }     }     return null;   }     if  getCookie 'test'  == null      alert "Please change your browser to accept cookies." ;   else     alert "Browser accepts cookies" ;                   The page content           494             Checking If the Browser Accepts Cookies Without  JavaScript   The drawback of the preceding section is that you must first make sure the browser understands  JavaScript. The preceding section will not work if the JavaScript is turned off.   Another way to check if the browser is willing to accept cookies is by creating a cookie on one  page and then immediately redirecting the user to a second page. In the second page you can then  try to read the cookies. The code in Listing 25.12 uses the   tag to create a cookie called  "test" and then redirects the browser to a second page called checkCookie.jsp  in Listing 25.13 .   Listing 25.12 Checking Browser Cookie Acceptance with Redirection                           In the second page, implemented using ASP in this example, you try to read the same cookie using  the code in Listing 25.13.   Listing 25.13 Reading the Cookies in the Browser Cookie Acceptance Test   <%     If Request.Cookies "test"    "" Then       Response.Write "Cookies accepted."     Else       Response.Write "Cookies not accepted."     End If   %>   Even though the code in this example only sends a message to the user telling him or her whether  or not his or her browser accepts cookies, you can modify it to suit your needs. For instance, you  can transfer the user to a warning page if the cookies are not accepted.       Summary   Cookies are very useful in various applications. In this chapter, you learned techniques useful for  manipulating cookies, both on the server side and on the client side. However, bear in mind that a  user can turn off cookies in his or her browser. Make sure you perform the cookie acceptance test  every time you write code that uses cookies in your applications.      495      Chapter 26. Working with Object Trees   This chapter covers working with objects in a hierarchy using JavaScript. There are various  applications for this. For example, you can have a folder tree like the one in Windows Explorer. In  that application, you can navigate through a file directory system and open a directory by clicking  a folder icon, as you saw in the document management application in Chapter 20, "Web-Based  Document Management." Other examples are an XML-based online help system and a table of  contents for an online book, as described in Chapter 19, "XML-Based E-Books."   When you work with objects in JavaScript, the array object is basically your only choice. This  chapter reviews the array object in JavaScript and then explains all the operations you need to  work with an object tree: create an object, append a child object to the root, search an object in the  object tree, append an object to another object, and delete an object.   The chapter concludes with an example of a folder tree. You'll find other applications of this tree  in upcoming chapters.     The Array Object   The Array object is the only data structure in JavaScript available for storing and manipulating  ordered collections of data that work in all scriptable browsers. Unlike arrays in Java, a JavaScript  array can be used to store different types of data as its elements. Also, as you'll see later in this  section, you can create an array with or without specifying the number of elements. If you create  an array without specifying the number of elements, the array behaves like a Vector object in Java,  where you can add elements arbitrarily.   The array object has one drawback: Deleting an element in an array is very difficult.   You also can use the new Object   constructor to create an object, but this works only in Navigator  version 3 and later and in Internet Explorer version 4 and later.   Creating an Array   var myArray = new Array  ;   Creating an array is as easy as assigning a variable with Array   using the new keyword:   Don't worry about specifying the number of elements, because a JavaScript array is perfectly  dynamic. You can add elements at any time after the array is created. If you must presize your  array for any reason, however, you can use the following statement:   var myArray = new Array 20 ;   The array element count starts from 0. If you specify an array with 20 elements as in the preceding  statement, the array has an element index from 0 to 19.   An array also has the length property. The length property adjusts itself when you add an element  with an index greater than the array size. For example, in the code in Listing 26.1 you first define  an array with 20 elements and then add the twenty-first element to the array. The length property  adjusts accordingly.      496      Listing 26.1 Creating Arrays       var myArray = new Array 20 ;   myArray[20] = "new element.";      myArray.length value is 21       Populating an Array   You populate an array by assigning values to its elements. For example, the code in Listing 26.2  creates an array called myArray and populates its first and second elements. In this case, the first  element is a number and the second element is a string. Unlike in some other languages where an  array must contain elements of the same data type, it is perfectly legal in JavaScript to populate an  array with various types of elements.   Listing 26.2 Populating an Array          define an array variable and create an Array object   var myArray = new Array  ;      populate the first and second elements   myArray[0] = 1;   myArray[1] = "the name";       You even can assign an array as an element of another array, as demonstrated in the code in  Listing 26.3.   Listing 26.3 Assigning an Array as an Element of Another Array          define an array variable and create an Array object   var anArray = new Array  ;   var anotherArray = new Array  ;   anArray[0] = 1;      assinging another array as an element of anArray   anArray[1] = anotherArray;       Knowing how to create and populate an array is the foundation for working with an object  hierarchy in JavaScript.   The delete Operator   Not until Navigator 4.0 did JavaScript include the delete operator for deleting an array element.  As you will soon see, however, using the delete operator is not an ideal way of deleting an element  because it does not decrease the length property of the array.   Listing 26.4 lists the code that uses the delete operator to delete the third element of an array.  Notice that the third element's value changes.   Listing 26.4 Deleting an Array Element               497      var myArray = new Array  ;   myArray[0] = "first element.";   myArray[1] = "second element.";   myArray[2] = "third element.";   document.write myArray.length + " " ;   document.write myArray[2] + " " ;   delete myArray[2];   document.write myArray.length + " " ;   document.write myArray[2] + " " ;           The code in Listing 26.4 writes the length property of myArray and the third element of it before  and after the third element is deleted using the delete operator. If you run the code in Internet  Explorer 4.0 and 5.0 and Netscape Navigator 4.0, you will see the following result:   3   third element.   3   undefined   Note   3   third element.   3   null   Note that the length property does not change after you delete the third element.   If you run the code in Netscape Navigator 3.0, you'll receive the following result:   The code in Listing 26.5 deletes an array element and reassigns a new value to the deleted element.   Listing 26.5 Deleting an Array Element and Reassigning a New Value           var myArray = new Array  ;   myArray[0] = "first element.";   myArray[1] = "second element.";   myArray[2] = "third element.";  document.write myArray.length + " " ;   document.write myArray[1] + " " ;   delete myArray[1];   document.write myArray.length + " " ;   document.write myArray[1] + " " ;   myArray[1] = "new element.";   document.write myArray.length + " " ;   document.write myArray[1] + " " ;   document.write myArray.length + " " ;   document.write myArray[2] + " " ;           If you run the code in Listing 26.5 in Internet Explorer 4.0 and 5.0 and Netscape Navigator 4.0,  you'll receive the following result:      498                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       3   second element.   3   undefined   3   new element.   3   third element.   Obviously, the delete operator does not really remove the element from memory. Because of this,  you sometimes need to devise another way to delete an array element.       Truly Deleting an Array Element   By now, you are probably as disappointed with the delete operator as I was. However, my  experiment reveals that you actually can decrease the length property of an array, which  effectively deletes the last element. Consider the code in Listing 26.6.   Listing 26.6 Truly Deleting an Array Element             var myArray = new Array  ;   myArray[0] = "first element.";   myArray[1] = "second element.";   myArray[2] = "third element.";     myArray.lengthââ;     document.write "Array length : " + myArray.length + " " ;     for  var i=0; i<myArray.length; i++      document.write "element " + i + " : " + myArray[i] + " " ;     document.write "element " + 3 + " : " + myArray[2] + " " ;             The result of the code in Listing 26.6 shows that after you decrement the length property, the last  element is really gone. Listing 26.7 presents a cross-browser function to delete the nth element of  an array.   The code in Listing 26.6 produces the following result:   Array length : 2   element 0 : first element.   element 1 : second element.   element 3 : undefined   Listing 26.7 The deleteElement Function   function deleteElement array, n  {      delete the nth element of array       499        var length = array.length;     if  n >= length  n<0        return;       for  var i=n; i<length-1; i++        array[i] = array[i+1];     array.lengthââ;   }   In Listing 26.7, n is assumed to be a numeric value. Consider the example in Listing 26.8, which  uses the deleteElement function.   Listing 26.8 Using the deleteElement Function             function deleteElement array, n  {      delete the nth element of array     var length = array.length;     if  n >= length  n<0        return;     for  var i=n; i<length-1; i++        array[i] = array[i+1];     array.lengthââ;   }     var myArray = new Array  ;   myArray[0] = "first element.";   myArray[1] = "second element.";   myArray[2] = "third element.";   myArray[3] = "4th";     document.write "length : " + myArray.length + " " ;   for  var i=0; i<myArray.length; i++      document.write "element " + i + " : " + myArray[i] + " " ;     deleteElement myArray, 1 ;   document.write "length : " + myArray.length + " " ;   for  var i=0; i<myArray.length; i++      document.write "element " + i + " : " + myArray[i] + " " ;             The code in Listing 26.8 creates and populates an array called myArray and displays the value of  the length property. It then loops through the myArray Array object to display the values of its  elements:   for  var i=0; i<myArray.length; i++      document.write "element " + i + " : " + myArray[i] + " " ;   The code then deletes the second element of myArray and redisplays the length property and the  contents. The result is as follows:   length : 4   element 0 : first element.   element 1 : second element.   element 2 : third element.       500      element 3 : 4th   length : 3   element 0 : first element.   element 1 : third element.   element 2 : 4th      Creating an Object       function createObject   {    var anArray = new Array  ;     return anArray;   }           function createDog name, color  {    var dog = new Array  ;     dog[0] = name;     dog[1] = color;     return dog;   }          A Hierarchy of Objects   Making an array behave like an object is another technique that comes in handy. The createObject  function in Listing 26.9 is a function that will return an object  which is technically an Array  object, of course .   Listing 26.9 The createObject Function to Create an Object   Alternatively, you can write a function that creates an object with predefined properties. For  example, the createDog function in Listing 26.10 creates a dog object with a name and fur color.   Listing 26.10 A Function that Creates an Object with Predefined Properties   Now that you have a function to create objects, you can have a hierarchy of objects. Having a  hierarchy of objects means establishing parent-child relationships among your objects. Consider,  for example, the Windows operating system's directory system, which has a drive called the C  drive. The C drive has a folder under it called Program Files. The Program Files folder is the child  object of the C drive. The C drive is the parent of the Program Files folder. The Program Files  folder in turn can have its own child objects.   In a hierarchy like the Windows directory system, there is always an object that does not have a  parent. In the directory system, it is the C drive. In many contexts, it is simply called the root. The  root plays an important role because it is the entry point of the hierarchy. Every single operation  involves the root. For example, if you create a family tree of dogs and you want to search for a  particular dog, the search starts from the root.   Appending a Child Object to Another Object      501      To create an object tree, you must have at least two objects and you must create a parent-child  relationship between them. Suppose, for example, that a Dog object has a name, a color, and zero  or more child Dog object s . You can use an array to represent the Dog object. The first and  second elements are reserved for the name and color, and then the third element and all following  elements are used for each child Dog object. Therefore, a Dog object has at least two elements: its  name and color. A Dog object with no child object will have only two elements. A Dog object  with one child object has three elements: name, color, and a reference to another Dog object. If the  Dog object has two child objects, it then has a fourth element for yet another Dog object.   The important thing here is creating a Dog object and establishing a relationship between a parent  and a child Dog object. You saw in the previous section the function used to create an object, and  now you need another function to append an object as a child object to another object. Just call  this function append. Listing 26.11 presents the append function.   Listing 26.11 The append Function       function append parent, child  {    parent[parent.length] = child;   }       The append function accepts two arguments: the object that will be the parent and the object that  will be the child in the relationship. Because an array is completely dynamic, you easily can create  a new element for the child object. The length property returns the number of elements, but the  element index starts with 0. Therefore, the length property returns the index that is the next  element in the array.   For example, the code in Listing 26.12 creates two Dog objects called doggy and puppy and then  creates a parent-child relationship between them.   Listing 26.12 Creating a Parent Object and a Child Object         function createDog name, color  {    var dog = new Array  ;     dog[0] = name;     dog[1] = color;     return dog;     }   function append parent, child  {    parent[parent.length] = child;   }     var doggy = createDog "boli", "black" ;   var puppy = createDog "boni", "white" ;   append doggy, puppy ;         for  var i = 0; i<doggy.length; i++  {    alert doggy[i]  ;   }      502  If you are curious about the parent-child relationship between the two objects, paste this at the end  of the code:       Navigating the Tree   When you run the code in a web browser, three alert windows appear. The first alert window  displays "boli," the second displays "black," and the third displays "boni, white."   Assume that you are creating the family tree of Bo, the famous family dog. To simplify things,  also assume that a dog only has one parent in the tree. Bo had two puppies: Boli and Boy.  Although Boy stayed a bachelor for the rest of his life, Boli later had two other puppies: Boni and  Bulbul. Boni later had Spotty and Mary.   The dog family tree is illustrated as follows:   Bo  ââ Boli    ââ Bulbul                  ââ Boni    ââ Spotty                             ââ Mary       ââ Boy   To create this tree, you first need to create individual dogs. Then, you need to build the tree  structure by appending a child dog to its parent object. Listing 26.13 presents the code to build  Bo's family tree.   Listing 26.13 Creating a Dog Family Tree           function createDog name, color  {    var dog = new Array  ;     dog[0] = name;     dog[1] = color;     return dog;   }   function append parent, child  {    parent[parent.length] = child;   }   var bo = createDog "bo", "brown" ;   var boli = createDog "boli", "black and white" ;   var boy = createDog "boy", "brown" ;   var bulbul = createDog "bulbul", "brown" ;   var boni = createDog "boni", "black and white" ;   var spotty = createDog "spotty", "black and white" ;   var mary = createDog "boni", "black and white" ;   append bo, boli ;   append bo, boy ;   append boli, bulbul ;   append boli, boni ;   append boni, spotty ;   append boni, mary ;           Now you can navigate the tree by printing each dog's name. To navigate, you need to learn about  the generation of each dog. The generation starts from 1. Bo is the root, so she is the first  generation in the tree. Navigating the tree basically means you start from the root, which is the  only object in the first generation. If the root has descendants  obviously it doesâhence the tree ,  the descendants are the second generation. You then loop through each member of the second  generation and find the descendants. The descendants of the second generation are the third  generation.      503      Listing 26.14 shows how to navigate an object tree using a recursive function.   Listing 26.14 Navigating an Object Tree           function navigate dog, generation  {    var name = dog[0];     document.write name + " " ;     generation++;     for  var j=2; j<dog.length; j++       has descendants       navigate dog[j], generation ;   }     navigate bo, 1 ;           When you run the code in Listing 26.14 in a web browser, the result is as follows:   bo   boli   bulbul   boni   spotty   mary   boy   Searching for an Object in the Object Tree   In the preceding section, you learned how to navigate an object tree. Navigation works from the  root toward the objects in the next generations. The same principle is used when you search for a  particular object in the tree. You begin the search from the root and continue until you find a  match. Sometimes, when you find a match, you can return the object without continuing the  navigation until the last object.   For example, the code in Listing 26.15 builds an object tree like the previous one and then  searches for a dog called "Bulbul." When that dog is found, the name and the color of the dog are  displayed and the function raises the flag found. This flag, when true, stops the search.   Listing 26.15 Searching for an Object in an Object Tree            Searching for Bulbul                  function createDog name, color  {    var dog = new Array  ;     dog[0] = name;     dog[1] = color;     return dog;   }     function append parent, child  {    parent[parent.length] = child;       504      }       var bo = createDog "bo", "brown" ;   var boli = createDog "boli", "black and white" ;   var boy = createDog "boy", "brown" ;   var bulbul = createDog "bulbul", "brown" ;   var boni = createDog "boni", "black and white" ;   var spotty = createDog "spotty", "black and white" ;   var mary = createDog "mary", "black and white" ;   append bo, boli ;   append bo, boy ;   append boli, bulbul ;   append boli, boni ;   append boni, spotty ;   append boni, mary ;     var found = false;   function search dog, generation, name  {    if  name == dog[0]  {      found = true;       alert "name:" + dog[0] + "\ncolor:" + dog[1] ;     }     else if  !found  {      generation++;       for  var j=2; j<dog.length; j++        has descendants         if  !found          search dog[j], generation, name ;     }   }     search bo, 1, "bulbul" ;                 Note that the search function is called by passing the root  bo , the generation  1 , and the name of  the search criteria  "bulbul" .   Displaying an Object Tree   Displaying an object tree is an important task. You can modify the code in Listing 26.15 to create  a new function that displays an object tree. Listing 26.16 presents this modified code.   Note that the code in Listing 26.16, as well as some other code listings, use the blank.gif image  located under the images subdirectory of the directory hosting the HTML file. This file is a normal  transparent .gif image. The blank.gif file is included on the CD that accompanies this book, in the  images directory.   Listing 26.16 Displaying an Object Tree            Displaying an object tree                      505      function createDog name, color  {    var dog = new Array  ;     dog[0] = name;     dog[1] = color;     return dog;   }     function append parent, child  {    parent[parent.length] = child;   }     var bo = createDog "bo", "brown" ;   var boli = createDog "boli", "black and white" ;   var boy = createDog "boy", "brown" ;   var bulbul = createDog "bulbul", "brown" ;   var boni = createDog "boni", "black and white" ;   var spotty = createDog "spotty", "black and white" ;   var mary = createDog "mary", "black and white" ;   append bo, boli ;   append bo, boy ;   append boli, bulbul ;   append boli, boni ;   append boni, spotty ;   append boni, mary ;       function navigate dog, generation  {    var name = dog[0];     for  var i=1; i<generation; i++        document.write " " ;     document.write name + " " ;     generation++;     for  var j=2; j<dog.length; j++        has descendants       navigate dog[j], generation ;   }     navigate bo, 1 ;                 The result displayed in a web browser is shown in Figure 26.1.   Figure 26.1. Displaying an object tree.      506         Deleting a Child Object   Listing 26.17 presents the code for deleting an object in an object tree using the deleteElement  function. You need to use the deleteElement function with caution, however. For example, in the  dog family tree, the array indexes 0 and 1 are reserved for the name and fur color. If you delete the  array index 0 or 1, your tree will lose its structure. Using the deleteElement wisely, however, can  result in a safe object deletion, as demonstrated in the code in Listing 26.17. The code in Listing  26.17 deletes Boni's third element  Spotty  from the tree.   Listing 26.17 Deleting a Child Object            Deleting a child object                  function createDog name, color  {    var dog = new Array  ;     dog[0] = name;     dog[1] = color;       return dog;   }     function append parent, child  {    parent[parent.length] = child;   }     var bo = createDog "bo", "brown" ;   var boli = createDog "boli", "black and white" ;   var boy = createDog "boy", "brown" ;   var bulbul = createDog "bulbul", "brown" ;   var boni = createDog "boni", "black and white" ;       507      var spotty = createDog "spotty", "black and white" ;   var mary = createDog "mary", "black and white" ;   append bo, boli ;   append bo, boy ;   append boli, bulbul ;   append boli, boni ;   append boni, spotty ;   append boni, mary ;     function deleteElement array, n  {      delete the nth element of array     var length = array.length;     if  n >= length  n<0        return;       for  var i=n; i<length-1; i++        array[i] = array[i+1];     array.lengthââ;   }     function navigate dog, generation  {    var name = dog[0];     for  var i=1; i<generation; i++        document.write " " ;     document.write name + " " ;     generation++;     for  var j=2; j<dog.length; j++        has descendants       navigate dog[j], generation ;   }     navigate bo, 1 ;   deleteElement boni, 2 ;   navigate bo, 1 ;                   The result of the code in Listing 26.17 is shown in Figure 26.2.   Figure 26.2. The object tree before and after the deletion.      508                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®          Notice that Spotty is missing from the second tree.   Event Handling in an Object Tree   You can add an event handler to the tree so that your application can respond when the user clicks  the mouse or rolls the mouse over an object. For example, the code in Listing 26.18 adds a  function called handler that responds when a user clicks an object. The response is a simple alert  window displaying the name of the dog.   Listing 26.18 Adding Event Handling to an Object Tree            Event handling in an object tree                  function createDog name, color  {    var dog = new Array  ;     dog[0] = name;     dog[1] = color;       return dog;   }     function append parent, child  {    parent[parent.length] = child;   }     var bo = createDog "bo", "brown" ;   var boli = createDog "boli", "black and white" ;   var boy = createDog "boy", "brown" ;   var bulbul = createDog "bulbul", "brown" ;       509      var boni = createDog "boni", "black and white" ;   var spotty = createDog "spotty", "black and white" ;   var mary = createDog "mary", "black and white" ;   append bo, boli ;   append bo, boy ;   append boli, bulbul ;   append boli, boni ;   append boni, spotty ;   append boni, mary ;     function handler name  {    alert name ;   }     function navigate dog, generation  {    var name = dog[0];     for  var i=1; i<generation; i++        document.write " " ;     document.write " " +       name + "  " ;     generation++;     for  var j=2; j<dog.length; j++        has descendants       navigate dog[j], generation ;   }     navigate bo, 1 ;                 Now, instead of plain text, each object is represented by a hyperlink that can respond to the user's  click, as shown in Figure 26.3.   Figure 26.3. Demonstration of event handling in an object tree.      510      Sometimes you'll want to change the look of the object tree when responding to the user event. For  example, in a folder tree, you probably want to display an open folder icon to indicate the folder  clicked by the user. This poses a problem, however, because the tree must be redrawn. The trick is  to store your JavaScript code in another page.   The example in Listing 26.19 uses a frame to store the JavaScript code and draws the object tree  in a different document.      Listing 26.19 Using a Frame             function createDog name, color  {    var dog = new Array  ;     dog[0] = name;     dog[1] = color;     return dog;   }     function append parent, child  {    parent[parent.length] = child;   }     var bo = createDog "bo", "brown" ;   var boli = createDog "boli", "black and white" ;     var boy = createDog "boy", "brown" ;   var bulbul = createDog "bulbul", "brown" ;   var boni = createDog "boni", "black and white" ;   var spotty = createDog "spotty", "black and white" ;   var mary = createDog "mary", "black and white" ;   append bo, boli ;   append bo, boy ;   append boli, bulbul ;       511      append boli, boni ;   append boni, spotty ;   append boni, mary ;     var dogClicked="";   function handler name  {    dogClicked = name;     var doc = frames[0].document;     doc.clear  ;     redraw bo, 1, doc ;     doc.close  ;   }     function redraw dog, generation, doc  {    var name = dog[0];     for  var i=1; i<generation; i++        doc.write " " ;     doc.write "<A HREF=\"javascript:parent.handler '" +       name + "' \">" ;     if  name == dogClicked        doc.write "  " + name + "  " ;     else       doc.write name ;     doc.write "  " ;     generation++;     for  var j=2; j<dog.length; j++        has descendants       redraw dog[j], generation, doc ;   }             <FRAMESET onLoad="redraw bo, 1, frames[0].document ;  frames[0].document.close  "   ROWS="100%, *">                     Note   Netscape browsers will complain if frame1.html or frame2.html is blank. To make them  happy, write a blank string.   Note that you need to close the document at the frameset's onLoad event; otherwise Internet  Explorer will behave unexpectedlyâfor example, it might refuse to clear the document.   An object tree that can change its appearance is shown in Figure 26.4. In this example, "boni" is  printed in italic because it is the selected dog.   Figure 26.4. An object tree that can change its appearance.      512          Summary      The Array object is one of the few data structures available when you need to work with objects in  JavaScript. Thanks to the flexibility of the Array object, you can assign an array as an element of  another array, which enables you to create a linked list or an object tree.   As you have seen in this chapter, object trees have many applications. Equipped with functions to  create objects, append an object to another object, and delete an object, you can manipulate an  object tree easily. This chapter also presented other functions for navigating, displaying, and  searchingâall of which you need when using an object tree.      513      Chapter 27. Controlling Applets   Java applets are powerful, and with them you can do many thingsâcreate animations,  communicate with the server, write a simple text editor, display news headlines, and other  interesting things that can humor any sedentary worker. Using applets, you can do almost  everything you can do with Java.   Applets are widely accepted, too; they are workable in both Netscape and Microsoft browsers.  You may be aware that you can do similar things with ActiveX components; however, ActiveX  components only feel at home in Microsoft browsers. You will need a plug-in if you want to play  ActiveX toys with Netscape Navigator.   What a shame that Microsoft decided not to support Java applets in its new operating system,  Windows XP. The user can download the plug-in separately, however.   This chapter does not discuss how to write applets. Indeed, that is beyond the scope of this book.  However, this chapter does discuss a different aspect of working with applets: how you can  control applets from an HTML page using JavaScript. You might want to run an applet's methods,  read its properties, or pass a value to it for further processing. For example, imagine that you have  a password-protected chat applet. In this applet, a user logs in on an HTML page before being able  to download the applet itself on the next web page. This is because you don't want unauthorized  people to be able to download the applet. The problem may sound simple, but it requires the  following steps:   1.  Display the Login page, where the user can type in the user name and password.  2.  Capture the user name and password and pass it back in the second page as cookies.  3.  Display the second page.  4.  Check whether the browser has finished downloading the applet.  5.   If the browser has finished downloading the applet, pass the cookies  the user name and  password  to the applet. If the browser hasn't finished downloading the applet, go back to  Step 4.   In addition, before you even let the server send a Java applet to the browser, you must make sure  that the browser understands Java and that the feature is enabled.   This chapter demonstrates how to achieve these tasks and much more. Also, this chapter provides  a discussion on how to write applets that can communicate with the document object model of an  HTML page.     Is Java Enabled?   Even though modern browsers leave their factories with Java support turned on, users can easily  switch this feature off for a number of reasons. If you use applets in any of your pages, you need  to make sure that this feature is on. You can do this easily with the navigator object's javaEnabled  method. A function, isJavaEnabled, is written using this method to check whether your applet can  be run in the page. Using this function, you can warn the user if the browser has Java capability  switched off. Listing 27.1 presents the isJavaEnabled function.   Listing 27.1 The isJavaEnabled Function           514      function isJavaEnabled   {    return   navigator.javaEnabled    ;   }          Is the Applet Ready?   When you communicate with a Java applet using JavaScript, you need to make sure that the  browser has finished downloading the applet and the applet has initialized itself. If the JavaScript  function or statement tries to access an applet that is not ready, an error will occur. The  isAppletReady function in Listing 27.2 can prevent user confusion and save the web developer  embarrassment.   Listing 27.2 The isAppletReady Function       function isAppletReady applet  {    return applet.isActive  ;   }       The isAppletReady function accepts a parameter: the applet that needs to be checked for readiness.  An applet object has the isActive property, whose value should be true if the applet is ready to be  accessed.   In an HTML page, an applet is like any other object. For example, suppose that there is a  collection of applets represented by applets in the document object model. To refer to the first  applet in the document, you can use document.applets[0]. The nth applet in the document is  document.applets[n-1].   The code in Listing 27.3 shows an HTML page with an applet. In addition, it has a form with a  button that the user can click to check whether the first applet in the document is ready.   Listing 27.3 Code to Check Whether an Applet Is Ready            Checking if an applet is ready        function isAppletReady applet  {    return applet.isActive  ;   }               <APPLET     CODEBASE = "."     CODE     = "MyApplet.class"     NAME     = "TestApplet"     WIDTH    = 200     HEIGHT   = 50     HSPACE   = 0       VSPACE   = 0     ALIGN    = middle   >       515          Click the button below to check if the applet is ready.           <INPUT TYPE=button VALUE="Check if the applet is ready"     onClick="if  !isAppletReady document.applets[0]   alert 'not  ready' ;" >                  Resizing an Applet   A browser treats an applet like other document objects. As a result, you can refer to an applet by  its name or by its order of appearance in the document. For example, the JavaScript code in  Listing 27.4 changes the height of the first applet on the page to 90 pixels and its width to 60  pixels.   Listing 27.4 Resizing an Applet       document.applets[0].height = 90;   document.applets[0].width = 60;          Calling an Applet's Method   import java.applet.*;     public class MyApplet extends Applet {    public int myMethod int a  {      return  5 + a ;     }     }   Listing 27.6 Calling an Applet's public Method            Call an applet's method            516  You can call any method in an applet from JavaScript code as long as the applet's method is public.  Suppose that, for example, you have an applet with one method called myMethod that returns an  int and accepts an int argument, as shown in Listing 27.5.   Listing 27.5 An Applet Whose public Method Will Be Called from JavaScript Script   If you know how to refer to the applet object in the HTML document, you can call the applet's  public method as if it is a method of any other JavaScript object. The code in Listing 27.6 shows  an example of how to use the myMethod method of the applet in Listing 27.5.         function add   {    var result = document.applets[0].myMethod "3" ;     alert "The sum is " + result ;   }                 Click the following button to run the applet's method.           <INPUT TYPE=BUTTON onClick='add  ;'     VALUE="Run Applet's Method ">         <APPLET     CODEBASE = "."     CODE     = "MyApplet.class"     NAME     = "TestApplet"     WIDTH    = 200     HEIGHT   = 50     HSPACE   = 0     VSPACE   = 0     ALIGN    = middle   >                  Getting an Applet's Property   You cannot read an applet's property directly, even though the property is public. To read an  applet's property, you need to create a public method in the applet that simply returns the property.  You then call this method from your JavaScript code to indirectly read the property.   The HTML file in Listing 27.7 shows a JavaScript function, getSecretValue, which in turn calls  the getAppletSecretValue method in the first applet in the document. The getAppletSecretValue  method in the applet must be written to return the applet property you want to read from  JavaScript code.   Listing 27.7 Reading an Applet's Property            Read an applet's property          function getSecretValue   {    var secret = document.applets[0].getAppletSecretValue  ;     alert "The secret is " + secret ;   }                   517          Click     here  to display the secret value.       <APPLET     CODEBASE = "."

Listing 27.8 Writing a public Method that Returns a Property   import java.applet.*;     public class MyApplet extends Applet {      private String secretValue = ":- ";     public String getAppletSecretValue   {      return secretValue;     }     }      Setting an Applet Property   As in the preceding code, you have to write to an applet property indirectly by writing a public  method in the applet that does the job. In the Java applet, create a public method that accepts an  argument. This argument is the value you need to assign to the property.   Listing 27.9 Writing an Applet's Property            Write to an applet's property          function setSecretValue str  {    document.applets[0].setSecretValue str ;   }                     Type your message in the following box as the applet's property value.   &nbsp;        518                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       &nbsp;<INPUT TYPE=BUTTON  onClick='setSecretValue this.form.Secret.value ;'     VALUE="Set Property">           <APPLET     CODEBASE = "."

You may think it's not possible, but it actually is. This  technique works only in Netscape browsers, however. For example, the code in Listing 27.11 uses  the java.awt.Toolkit class' methods to display the monitor width and height.   Listing 27.11 Using Java Classes Directly            Accessing Java directly from JavaScript        alert "Screen Dimension\n" +     "  width:" +     java.awt.Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit  .getScreenSize  .width +     " height:" +       java.awt.Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit  .getScreenSize  .height ;                      519        Applet-to-JavaScript Communication   You can perform applet-to-JavaScript communication to access the document object model or to  call a JavaScript function on an HTML page. Internet Explorer version 4.0 and later and Netscape  Navigator version 3.0 and later enable this through the Java wrapper class  netscape.javascript.JSObject. In Navigator 3.0, the JSObject class comes in the file named java_30  or java_301; in Navigator 4.0, the file is called java40.jar. In Internet Explorer 4.0, the file is in the  H3rfb7jn.zip file.   Due to security reasons, JSObject support is not enabled by default. To enable JSObject support, a  new attribute called MAYSCRIPT needs to be present in the APPLET tag, as follows:   <APPLET CODE="MyApplet.class" CODEBASE="." WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="100"  MAYSCRIPT>   JSObject will be disabled if MAYSCRIPT is absent.   Each JSObject encapsulates an entity in the document object model in the JavaScript world. The  JSObject's methods are listed in Table 27.1.   public Object eval String s   Evaluates a JavaScript expression. The expression is a string of   Method   public Object call String  methodName, Object args[]    public Object getMember   String name   public Object getSlot  int  index   public static JSObject  getWindow Applet applet   public void  removeMember String  name   public void setMember   String name, Object value   public void setSlot  int  index, Object value   public String toString     Table 27.1. JSObject's Methods   Description   Invokes JavaScript function. Pass null if the function does not have  an argument; otherwise pass an Object array. Equivalent  "this.methodName args[0], args[1], ... " in  JavaScript.   JavaScript source code that will be evaluated in the context given by  the keyword "this".  Retrieves a named member of a JavaScript object. Equivalent to  "this.name" in JavaScript.  Retrieves an indexed member of a JavaScript object. Equivalent to  "this[index]" in JavaScript.  Returns a JSObject for the window containing the given applet.  This method is available only on the client.  Removes a named member of a JavaScript object.   Sets a named member of a JavaScript object. Equivalent to  "this.name = value" in JavaScript.  Sets an indexed member of a JavaScript object. Equivalent to  "this[index] = value" in JavaScript.  Converts a JSObject to a String.   To compile Java code to take advantage of JSObject, you must have the package  netscape.javascript in the CLASSPATH. Currently, Java Plug-in 1.2.2, which is  downloadable from Sun's web site, ships netscape.javascript in a JAR file called  JAWS.JAR. To compile an applet that uses JSObject, add JAWS.JAR in the CLASSPATH before  compilation. If you are using modern Java tools, such as JBuilder 4.0 or 5.0, this package has been  included.      520         Notice that although JSObject is supported in Java Plug-in 1.2.2, it is not supported in  AppletViewer in the Java 2.0 platform, Standard Edition version 1.2.2. As a result, applets using  JSObject may not run in AppletViewer, or they may result in exceptions. To test your applet that  accesses the document object model of an HTML page, open the HTML page that hosts the    tag in a browser.   For browser compatibility, use only the getWindow  , call  , eval  , setMember  , and  getMember   methods. The implementation of getSlot  , setSlot  , removeMember  , and toString    is browser-dependent, so the result of the execution may vary depending on the version and  platform of the browser.   Any development using JSObject starts with the static method, as follows:   public static JSObject getWindow Applet a    This method returns a JSObject, which represents the Window object in the JavaScript script for  the window containing the given applet. Because this method takes only java.awt.Applet as a  parameter, JSObject can be accessed from an applet, but not from a bean unless the bean is also an  applet.   Note   In Internet Explorer, Java Plug-in provides full support of JSObject in Internet Explorer  3.0 4.0 by accessing the document object model through COM.   In Netscape Navigator, Java Plug-in provides limited support of JSObject in Navigator  3.0 4.0 by accessing the document object model through Netscape's Plug-in API.   Currently, in Navigator 3.0 the following JavaScript objects can be accessed through JSObject:      Anchor     Document     Element     Form     Frame     History  Image        Link     Location     Navigator     Option     URL     Window      Layer     UIBar   In Netscape Navigator 4.0, all the JavaScript objects mentioned previously are supported. In  addition, Navigator supports the following:   All have JavaScript objects not mentioned are not supported, and accessing them through  JSObject will result in Java exceptions being thrown.      521      Notice that even though different browsers may support the same JavaScript object, the methods  and properties the JavaScript object supports may be different.       Accessing the Document Object Model from an Applet   As mentioned previously, you can use the JSObject object to access the document object model.  For example, the code in Listing 27.12 is an applet called MyApplet that reads the value of the  firstName TEXT element into a String object reference called str. The applet then writes str to the  loginName TEXT element in the same form.   Listing 27.12 Applet that Accesses the Document Object Model   import java.applet.*;   import netscape.javascript.*;     public class MyApplet extends Applet {      public void init   {      JSObject window = JSObject.getWindow this ;       JSObject doc =  JSObject  window.getMember "document" ;       JSObject form =  JSObject  doc.getMember "form1" ;       JSObject firstName =  JSObject  form.getMember "firstName" ;       String str =  String  firstName.getMember "value" ;       JSObject loginName =  JSObject  form.getMember "loginName" ;       loginName.setMember "value", str ;     }     }   The HTML page in Listing 27.13 hosts the applet in Listing 27.12 to demonstrate how the applet  can access an HTML document.   Listing 27.13 The HTML Page that Hosts the Applet that Accesses the Document  Object Model            Accessing the document object model                   firstName:      loginName:                 The applet will copy the value of firstName to loginName.       <APPLET     CODEBASE = "."     CODE     = "MyApplet.class"     NAME     = "TestApplet"     WIDTH    = 40     HEIGHT   = 30       522        HSPACE   = 0     VSPACE   = 0     ALIGN    = middle     MAYSCRIPT   >                  Invoking JavaScript Functions from an Applet   After your applet has access to the document object model, it can do anything that can be done  from JavaScript. This includes invoking a JavaScript function. The code in Listing 27.14 shows an  applet that invokes the noArg and twoArgs JavaScript functions, as well as the alert method.   Listing 27.14 An Applet that Invokes JavaScript Functions   import java.applet.*;   import netscape.javascript.*;     public class MyApplet extends Applet {      public void init   {      JSObject window = JSObject.getWindow this ;          invoking a custom function called noArg          that accepts no argument.       window.call "noArg", null ;            invoking the alert method, passing one          argument obj1;       Object[] obj1 = new Object[1];       obj1[0] = "Hello from MyApplet!!!";       window.call "alert", obj1 ;            invoking the custom function twoArgs          with two arguments.       Object[] obj2 = new Object[2];       obj2[0] = "one ";       obj2[1] = "2";       window.call "twoArgs", obj2 ;     }     }   The applet in Listing 27.14 can be used in the HTML page in Listing 27.15.   Listing 27.15 HTML Page that Hosts an Applet that Invokes JavaScript Functions            Invoke a JavaScript function from an applet        function noArg   {    alert "You have successfully invoked a no argument " +       "JavaScript function from an Applet." ;   }       523        function twoArgs arg1, arg2  {    alert arg1 + arg2 ;   }               The following applet invokes the alert method and the two custom functions noArg and twoArgs:   <APPLET     CODEBASE = "."     CODE     = "MyApplet.class"     NAME     = "TestApplet"     WIDTH    = 400     HEIGHT   = 300     HSPACE   = 0     VSPACE   = 0     ALIGN    = middle     MAYSCRIPT   >                  Evaluating a JavaScript Statement from an Applet   This technique demonstrates how to evaluate a JavaScript statement from an applet. An example  that shows how this happens is presented in Listing 27.16 and Listing 27.17. The code in Listing  27.16 shows an applet that evaluates a JavaScript function. The code in Listing 27.17 is an HTML  page that uses such an applet. The applet in Listing 27.16 uses the eval method to write to the  loginName and password HIDDEN elements and then to invoke the alert method.   Listing 27.16 The Applet that Uses the JavaScript eval Method to Evaluate a  JavaScript Statement   import java.applet.*;   import netscape.javascript.*;     public class MyApplet extends Applet {      public void init   {      JSObject window = JSObject.getWindow this ;       String loginName = "boni";       String password = "secret";       window.eval "document.forms[0].loginName.value='" + loginName +  "'" ;       window.eval "document.forms[0].password.value='" + password +  "'" ;       window.eval "alert 'Secret login name and password copied.' " ;       }     }      524      Listing 27.17 The HTML Page that Hosts the Applet that Evaluates JavaScript  Statements            Invoke a JavaScript statement                                The following applet will copy the secret login name and   password to the HIDDEN elements.   <APPLET     CODEBASE = "."     CODE     = "MyApplet.class"     NAME     = "TestApplet"     WIDTH    = 400     HEIGHT   = 300     HSPACE   = 0     VSPACE   = 0     ALIGN    = middle     MAYSCRIPT   >                  Setting the Applet Parameter   The PARAM VALUE of the   tag can't be changed at run timeâit can only be changed  during layout time. Working only on Netscape browsers, the code in Listing 27.18 uses JavaScript  "entities" to set calculated VALUES that could come from a JavaScript variable, a JavaScript  function, or a JavaScript expression.   Listing 27.18 Setting Applet Parameters in Netscape Browsers               var greeting = "Hello World";     function sayHello    {    return "Hello again";   }                             <PARAM NAME="jsExpression"     VALUE="&{'This is an expression'.toUpperCase  };">       525                  For Microsoft browsers, use the document.write   method to customize the APPLET PARAM  during layout time.       Applet-to-Applet Communication Through JavaScript   Now that you know how to call a JavaScript function from inside an applet and invoke an applet's  method from JavaScript, applet-to-applet communication is at your disposal. If you need to run a  method on the second applet from the first method, for example, you can create an intermediary  JavaScript function that invokes the method on the second applet and then calls the JavaScript  function from the first applet.   Figure 27.1 illustrates how an applet can send a message to another applet. The first applet has a  text box and a button, and the second applet has only one text box. A user can type a string in the  text box of the first applet. When the user clicks the button on the first applet, the string typed will  also be displayed in the second applet's text box.   Figure 27.1. Applet-to-applet communication.   Listing 27.19 and Listing 27.20 present the code for both applets. Listing 27.21 shows the HTML  page that hosts both applets.   Listing 27.19 The First Applet in Applet-to-Applet Communication      import java.applet.*;       526      import java.awt.*;   import java.awt.event.*;   import netscape.javascript.*;     public class MyApplet extends Applet implements ActionListener {    TextField textField1 = new TextField  ;     Button button1 = new Button "Send Message" ;     TextField textField2 = new TextField  ;     JSObject window;       public void init   {      this.setLayout null ;       add textField1, null ;         textField1.setSize 100, 20 ;       add button1, null ;       button1.setBounds 120, 0, 100, 20 ;       button1.setForeground new Color 255, 255, 255  ;       button1.setBackground new Color 0, 0, 0  ;       button1.addActionListener this ;       window = JSObject.getWindow this ;     }       public void actionPerformed ActionEvent ae  {      window.eval "sendMessage '" + textField1.getText   + "' " ;     }   }   Listing 27.20 The Second Applet in Applet-to-Applet Communication   import java.applet.*;   import java.awt.TextField;     public class SecondApplet extends Applet {    TextField textField1 = new TextField  ;       public void init   {      this.setLayout null ;       add textField1, null ;       textField1.setSize 100, 20 ;     }       public void setMessage String message  {      textField1.setText message ;     }   }   Listing 27.21 The HTML Page Where the Applet-to-Applet Communication Happens            Applet-to-applet communication through JavaScript        function sendMessage message  {    document.applets[1].setMessage message ;     }                     527      You can send a message to the second applet from the first applet.    Just type your message in the text box in the first applet,    and click the button.       <APPLET     CODEBASE = "."

The following examples show direct communication between two applets. The first applet sends a  message to the second applet in the same HTML page. Listing 27.22 and Listing 27.23 show the  code for the first applet and second applet, respectively. Listing 27.24 presents the HTML page  that hosts the two applets.

For this reason,  understanding how to work with applets in the document object model context is very helpful.   This chapter presented techniques to help you work with applets. You learned how to check  whether Java is enabled in a browser, set and get a property from an applet, and send messages to  an applet from JavaScript. Additionally, you discovered how to achieve applet-to-applet  communication.      530      Part III: Developing Scalable Applications with  EJB   Part III Developing Scalable Applications with EJB    28 Enterprise JavaBeans     29 The Session Bean     30 Entity Beans     31 EJB Query Language     32 Java Message Service     33 Message-Driven Beans      531      Chapter 28. Enterprise JavaBeans   In previous chapters, you learned how to develop and deploy servlet and JSP applications. Both  servlet and JSP are good technologies in use today that are continuing to get more and more  popular.   From this chapter on, you will learn how to develop and deploy Enterprise JavaBeans  EJB   applications. For the most part, for simple web applications you should probably stick with  servlets JSP and avoid EJB altogether. If robustness and scalability are an issue, however, you  should consider developing an EJB application. As this chapter shows, there are many benefits  that make EJB appealing.   The EJB technology depends on other Java technologies to function properly. First, it uses Java  Remote Method Invocation  RMI  as the communication protocol between two enterprise beans  and between an enterprise bean and its client. If you are a seasoned Java programmer, you should  know how RMI is used in Java-distributed computing to invoke remote methods on a remote  machine.   Another technology used in EJB is Remote Method Invocation over Internet Inter-ORB Protocol   RMI-IIOP , where ORB stands for Object Request Broker. RMI-IIOP is a more portable version  of RMI that can use the IIOP from the Object Management Group  OMG . RMI-IIOP is especially  used in communications between an enterprise bean and a client.   Lastly, EJB uses Java Naming and Directory Interface  JNDI  as the naming service that binds a  name with an enterprise bean.   Note   To understand EJB completely, an understanding of these supporting technologies is  mandatory.   This chapter serves as the introduction to EJB. The discussion starts by defining EJB and  presenting some of EJB's benefits, most of which are not available in servlets JSP. The chapter  then discusses the architecture and the distinct roles in the EJB application and deployment life  cycle, and provides a sample application and some technical insights by presenting a review of the  javax.ejb package. Lastly, the chapter presents two client applications to test the sample  application.   The phrases Enterprise JavaBean or enterprise bean in this chapter and the chapters to come are  interchangeable. Don't confuse them with beans that are used in a JSP application, which is a  totally different thing. The word bean in all cases in this chapter refers to an enterprise bean.       What Is an Enterprise JavaBean?   In a nutshell, an enterprise JavaBean is a server-side component. Just like any other component, an  enterprise bean encapsulates business logic. Enterprise beans must conform to the EJB  specifications, however, and they are deployed and can run only in an EJB container, identical to  the way servlets run inside a servlet container.      532   A servlet container provides services for servlets, such as session management and security.  Likewise, an EJB container provides system-level services for EJB applications. In fact, as you  will soon find out, it's the EJB container that makes EJB so great. Despite the similarity of names,  EJB has little to do with JavaBeans.          Benefits of EJB   EJB applications are much more complex and more difficult to build and administer than  servlets JSP applications. For someone new to EJB, the learning curve also is steeper. If this is the  case, why is EJB so popular and why do so many organizations want to invest in it? The answer is  simpleâafter you know the nuts and bolts of EJB, writing an application is an easy task, and,  more importantly, you can enjoy some benefits provided for you by the EJB container.   The following is the list of some of the benefits of EJB:      EJB applications are easy to develop because the application developer can concentrate  on the business logic. At the same time, the developer uses the services provided by the  EJB container, such as transactions and connection pooling. Again, the hardest part is the  learning process.      EJBs are components. Chances are good that there are EJB vendors who sell components  that encapsulate the functionality that you need. By purchasing a third-party's EJBs, you  can avoid needing to develop your own beans, which means your application  development is more rapid. The EJB specification makes sure that beans developed by  others can be used in your application.      There is a clear separation of labor in the development, deployment, and administration of  an EJB application. This makes the development and deployment process even faster. The  roles are discussed in detail in the section, "The Six EJB Roles."      The EJB container manages transactions, state management details, multithreading,  connection pooling, and other low-level APIs without you, the developer, having to  understand them.      The EJB container provides security for the applications.     The EJB architecture is compatible with other Java APIs.     EJB Application Architecture   The EJB application architecture  shown in Figure 28.1  extends the web application architecture  by adding another tier.   Figure 28.1. The EJB application architecture.   Clients of an enterprise bean can be a traditional Java application, an applet, a JSP page or servlet,  another EJB bean, or others.         533      Note that a client never invokes a bean's methods directly. Communication between clients and  beans is done through the EJB container. Compare this with a web application in which a client  web browser has to go through the web container to use a servlet or a JSP page.   When a client is a servlet or a JSP page, the structure of an EJB application looks like that shown  in Figure 28.2.   Figure 28.2. An EJB application with a servlet as the client.      The six distinct roles in the EJB application development and deployment life cycle are as follows:       The Six EJB Roles      Bean developer     Application assembler     Deployer     System administrator     EJB server provider     EJB container provider   Each role can be performed by a different individual or organization. Often, however, an  individual plays more than one role in a given time. For example, normally there is no clear  separation between an EJB server and an EJB container; that is, they normally come in one  package from a vendor.   All the six roles are explained in the following sections.   Bean Developer   The bean developer is the programmer who develops enterprise beans. To be a successful bean  developer, you need to understand the business logic of the application.   Application Assembler   An EJB application typically consists of more than one enterprise bean. For larger applications,  several bean developers may be employed to build the beans. The application assembler is the  person responsible for assembling all the beans written by the bean developer s . The application  assembler also writes the deployment descriptor. The examples in this book also require you to be  an application assembler.   Deployer      534      The deployer is the one in charge of deploying the EJB application in a particular EJB container or  containers, if there is more than one EJB container used. This person takes the enterprise bean s   and deployment descriptor from the application assembler as the input. This person must be an  expert of the EJB container used. You also are introduced to this role during the development and  deployment of the sample EJB application presented in this book.   System Administrator   After the EJB application is deployed successfully, the application still must be maintained on a  day-to-day basisâor perhaps minute-to-minute is more accurate. It is the system administrator's  role to make sure that the application runs 24 hours a day without interruption. If a server crashes,  the administrator makes sure that it is restarted immediately.   Also, the system administrator is responsible for managing security. For example, it's the system  administrator's job to create a new account for a new user or a group of users. In a large  organization, this role is a full-time job.   EJB Container Provider   The EJB container provider is a vendor that has the resources to write an EJB container and to  make sure that the software conforms to the EJB specification. The developer of the EJB container  also should provide various tools for the system administrator for easily administering the EJB  applications deployed. For example, there should be a tool that the system administrator can use to  add a user easily. This book is not concerned with this role.   EJB Server Provider   The EJB server provider provides an EJB server which in turn hosts the EJB container. Currently,  the EJB architecture does not clearly state the separation of this role from the EJB container  provider role. Most EJB containers come packaged in an EJB server. This book does assume that  you will write an EJB server.       Types of Enterprise Beans   You use three types of enterprise beans: session, entity, and message-driven. A session bean is a  component that performs a certain task for the client. An entity bean represents an entity in the  database or other persistent storage. Message-driven beans are a new addition to EJB 2.0. They  serve as a listener for the Java Message Service API that enables asynchronous message  processing. All these beans are discussed in the next few chapters.       Writing Your First Enterprise Bean   As usual, I will present a sample application as a proof of concept. All the samples in this book  run in a JBoss application server; therefore, they require that you install JBoss. If you haven't  already installed JBoss, you can use Appendix F, "JBoss Installation and Configuration," as a step- by-step guide.      535      After finishing the sample application, you need to create a client application to call your bean.  You need to know some theory to write a client application. This theory is given in the section,  "Writing Client Applications."   Developing and deploying an EJB application requires the following steps:   1.  Writing the bean.  2.  Writing the deployment descriptor.  3.  Creating a deployment file.  4.  Deploying the bean.  5.  Writing the client application to test the bean.   The following example builds an EJB application consisting of only one enterprise bean that can  perform additions of two integers. After successfully compiling the bean, you will write the  deployment descriptor and deploy the bean. Lastly, you will create a servlet that serves as the  client of our EJB application.   Writing and Compiling the Adder Bean   You have three Java files to write, all of which are part of the com.brainysoft-ware.ejb package.  So the first thing you need to do is to create the appropriate directory structure. Figure 28.3  displays the directory structure of an EJB application.   Figure 28.3. The directory structure of an EJB application.   The three Java files you need to create in the com brainysoftware ejb directory are  AdderHome.java, Adder.java, and AdderBean.java. AdderHome and Adder are the home and  remote interfaces of the enterprise bean. Both are explained in the section, "EJB Explained," later  in this chapter. Listings 28.1 through 28.3 provide the code for each of these files.      Listing 28.1 The AdderHome Interface   package com.brainysoftware.ejb;     import java.rmi.RemoteException;   import javax.ejb.CreateException;   import javax.ejb.EJBHome;     public interface AdderHome extends EJBHome {    Adder create   throws RemoteException, CreateException;   }   Listing 28.2 The Adder Interface   package com.brainysoftware.ejb;     import javax.ejb.EJBObject;   import java.rmi.RemoteException;       536        public interface Adder extends EJBObject {    public int add int a, int b  throws RemoteException;   Listing 28.3 The AdderBean Class   package com.brainysoftware.ejb;     import java.rmi.RemoteException;   import javax.ejb.SessionBean;   import javax.ejb.SessionContext;     public class AdderBean implements SessionBean {      public int add int a, int b  {      System.out.println "from AdderBean" ;       return  a + b ;     }       public void ejbCreate   {    }       public void ejbRemove   {    }       public void ejbActivate   {    }       public void ejbPassivate   {    }       public void setSessionContext SessionContext sc  {    }   }   Writing the Deployment Descriptor   An EJB application must have a deployment descriptor that describes each enterprise bean in that  application. The deployment descriptor file is called ejb.xml. For the sample application, the  deployment descriptor is given in Listing 28.4.   Listing 28.4 The Deployment Descriptor                Your first EJB application        Adder Application                         Adder           com.brainysoftware.ejb.AdderHome           com.brainysoftware.ejb.Adder           com.brainysoftware.ejb.AdderBean           Stateless           Bean                         537      Creating a Deployment File   After you finish developing your enterprise bean, you need to package all the class files into  one .jar file. The class files are given in the directory structure displayed in Figure 28.3. The ejb  directory contains three files: Adder.class, AdderHome.class, and AdderBean.class. The META- INF directory contains one file: the ejb-jar.xml file, the deployment descriptor.   Follow these steps to create the deployment file:   1.  Change directory to the parent directory of both com and META-INF.  2.  Assuming jar.exe is already in the path, type the following:   jar cfv adder.jar com brainysoftware ejb * META-INF ejb-jar.xml   3.  This creates a jar file called adder.jar.   Deployment   Copy the adder.jar file into the deployment directory under JBoss home. Restart JBoss. JBoss  should spit out some messages. In the lines of messages, look for the following:   ...   [Auto deploy] Starting   [Auto deploy] Auto deploy of file: C: jboss deploy adder.jar   ...   [J2EE Deployer] Create application adder.jar   [J2EE Deployer] Installing EJB package: adder.jar   [J2EE Deployer] Starting module adder.jar   ...   [J2EE Deployer] J2EE application: file: C: jboss deploy adder.jar is   deployed.   ...   That's it. Your EJB application has been successfully deployed.   To test your enterprise bean, however, you need a client application. You learn how to write a  client application later in the section, "Writing Client Applications." Before you write one,  however, you need to see how EJB works.       EJB Explained   As you have seen from the preceding section, an enterprise bean does not consist of a one class. In  fact, there are always two interfaces that accompany a bean class. These two interfaces are called  the home interface and the remote interface. They are there to enable communications between a  client and an enterprise bean. The enterprise bean contains the implementation of the business  rules. Of course, an enterprise bean can have other classes as well. The two interfaces and one  implementation class serve as the minimum.   The home interface and the remote interface are crucial because they are the "door" to an  enterprise bean for a client application.      538                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       The Home Interface   The EJB specification states that an enterprise bean and its supporting components are written by  implementing or extending members of the javax.ejb package.   The home interface performs life cycle operations: creating, finding, and removing the enterprise  bean. A home interface must extend the EJBHome interface in the javax.ejb package. The  javax.ejb.EJBHome interface is given as follows:   package javax.ejb;     public interface EJBHome extends java.rmi.Remote {      EJBMetaData getEJBMetaData         throws java.rmi.RemoteException;       HomeHandle getHomeHandle         throws java.rmi.RemoteException;       void remove Handle handle        throws java.rmi.RemoteException, javax.ejb.RemoveException;       void remove Object primaryKey        throws java.rmi.RemoteException, javax.ejb.RemoveException;   }   See how the EJBHome interface is derived from the java.rmi.Remote interface? This is the first  sign you've seen in this chapter that EJB is dependent on RMI.   The java.rmi.Remote interface itself is used to identify interfaces whose methods may be invoked  from a non-local virtual machine. Any remote object must implement this interface either directly  or indirectly.   A home interface can define methods to create, find, and remove the enterprise bean. The create  and find methods are added to the home interface definition; the remove methods are inherited  from the javax.ejb.EJBHome interface. For instance, the home interface of the Adder EJB  the  AdderHome interface , given in Listing 28.1, defines a no-argument create method in its body,  using the following code:   import java.rmi.RemoteException;   import javax.ejb.CreateException;   import javax.ejb.EJBHome;     public interface AdderHome extends EJBHome {      Adder create   throws RemoteException, CreateException;     }   A home interface can define multiple overloads of the create and find methods. The create and  find methods also can throw additional exceptions, if required. The name for a find method always  start with "find".   Both the create and find methods are optional. Not all beans need them. For example, a session  bean might define one or more create methods but an entity bean might not. This will become  clear when you learn about session and entity beans in Chapters 29 and 30.      539      Note   An instance of a home interface is sometimes called a home object.   The Remote Interface   The remote interface duplicates all the business methods that are to be available to a client. This  happens, again, because the client cannot access the bean directly.   A remote interface must extend the EJBObject interface in the javax.ejb package. The  javax.ejb.EJBObject is defined as follows:   package javax.ejb;   public interface EJBObject extends java.rmi.Remote {    public abstract EJBHome getEJBHome         throws java.rmi.RemoteException;     public abstract Object getPrimaryKey         throws java.rmi.RemoteException;       public abstract void remove         throws java.rmi.RemoteException, javax.ejb.RemoveException     public abstract Handle getHandle         throws java.rmi.RemoteException;       public abstract boolean isIdentical EJBObject obj        throws java.rmi.RemoteException;   }   Like the javax.ejb.EJBHome interface, this interface extends the java.rmi.Remote interface.   In the Adder bean example, the remote interface is called Adder and is given in Listing 28.2. As  you can see, it clones the add method found in the bean implementation in Listing 28.3 by using  the following code:   import javax.ejb.EJBObject;   import java.rmi.RemoteException;     public interface Adder extends EJBObject {    public int add int a, int b  throws RemoteException;   }   Note   An instance of a remote interface is often called the EJB object.   The Enterprise Bean Class   This class provides the implementations of the life cycle methods in the home interface as well as  the business logic defined in the remote interface.   An enterprise bean class is either a session bean, an entity bean, or a message-driven bean. In  other words, a session bean implements the javax.ejb.SessionBean interface and an entity bean  implements the javax.ejb.EntityBean interface. Therefore, an enterprise bean class also must  provide the implementation of the EJB container callback methods defined in either the  javax.ejb.SessionBean interface or the javax.ejb.EntityBean interface.      540      The life cycle create and find methods in the home interface correspond to the ejbCreate,  ejbPostCreate, and ejbFind methods in the bean class. You learn more about the enterprise bean  class in Chapters 18 and 19.   The Deployment Descriptor   An EJB application needs a deployment descriptor that specifies meta information for the EJB  container. The deployment descriptor is an XML file called ejb.xml and must be located in the  META-INF directory under the application directory.   The following is some is some of the information specified by the deployment descriptor:      The enterprise bean name     The type of the bean     The fully qualified name of the home interface     The fully qualified name of the remote interface   The deployment descriptor can define more than one bean.       Writing Client Applications   An enterprise bean is a server-side component that sits idle on the server waiting for a call from  clients. Writing an EJB client can sometimes be a tricky business. Without a client, however, you  can't test your enterprise beans. Understanding how the client gets access and calls your bean is  therefore an important part of the EJB application.   An EJB client does not invoke methods in the enterprise bean class directly. In fact, a client can  see only the home and remote interfaces of the bean, as shown in Figure 28.4.   Figure 28.4. A client can see only the home and remote interfaces of an EJB.      Client applications access the enterprise bean through the Java Naming and Directory Interface   JNDI . Therefore, understanding JNDI is very helpful in writing effective and efficient client  applications. A brief summary of JNDI is given next that will enable you to write client  applications to access enterprise beans.   In this example, you write two types of client applications. The first is a Java application  consisting of one simple class called BeanClient. The second client application is a JSP page that  demonstrates how to use an enterprise bean from a servlet or a JSP page.      541      The first client is important because it demonstrates the basic functionality that must exist for the  client to call an enterprise bean. The second client is also crucial because, as a web developer, you  will need to access an EJB application from inside a servlet or a JSP page.   Let's now take a brief look at JNDI.   Java Naming and Directory Interface  JNDI    Access to an enterprise bean is done through JNDI. Therefore, it is crucial to understand this API.  If you already have good knowledge of JNDI, you can skip this section.   JNDI comes as part of JDK 1.3 and later. If you are currently using JDK 1.2, you need to  download JNDI and install it separately. JNDI provides two services: a naming service and a  directory service.   A naming service is a very important feature in computing because it finds an object associated  with a given name. An example of a popular naming service is the Internet Domain Name System   DNS  that maps domain names  such as newriders.com  with IP addresses. In the context of EJB,  a naming service finds an enterprise bean for you if you know the name given to the bean.   If a client application wants to call an enterprise bean, it simply needs to supply the name of the  bean. JNDI will find the bean for the client. As such, it is not surprising why a naming service  plays an important role in EJB.   A directory service is an extension of a naming service. A directory service associates names with  objects and also allows those objects to have attributes that describe the objects. These attributes  enable you to search for an object without knowing its name. An example of a directory service is  the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol  LDAP . Directory services are not used to access  enterprise beansâtherefore, they are outside the scope of this book.   The JNDI is divided into five packages. These are as follows:                   javax.naming  javax.naming.directory  javax.naming.event  javax.naming.ldap  javax.naming.spi   Knowing the javax.naming package is sufficient for accessing an enterprise bean. In writing a  client application that uses the service of an enterprise bean, you need to understand well two  important members of the javax.naming package: the Context interface and the InitialContext  class.   The javax.naming.Context Interface   The Context interface represents a naming context consisting of a set of name-to-object  association. This association in JNDI terms is called binding. The Context interface is important  because it contains methods for examining and modifying the name-to-object bindings.   The most frequently used method in the Context interface is probably the lookup method. This  method returns a reference to an object, given the name of the object. There are two overloads of  this method. The signatures of both overloads are as follows:   public Object lookup javax.naming.Name name  throws  javax.naming.NamingException       542      public Object lookup String name  throws javax.naming.NamingException   You use the lookup method to obtain a reference to an enterprise bean's home object. The second  overload of the lookup method is very straightforward. You simply pass the string representation  of the bean's name and you get a reference to the bean's home object.   The lookup method throws a javax.naming.NamingException object if the name resolution fails.   The javax.naming.InitialContext Class   Naming operations are relative to a context. The InitialContext class implements the Context  interface and provides the starting context for name resolutions.   For a context, you need to define a number of properties for the environment of the context. For  example, a naming resolution may be restricted to authorized users only. In this case, you need to  supply a user's credentials as properties. You normally create a java.util.Properties object and use  its put method to add key value pairs representing any necessary property names and values.   In accessing an enterprise bean, you need to supply two properties. The first is the environment  property java.naming.factory.initial. The value of this property is the fully qualified class name  that will be used to create the initial context.   The second property is java.naming.provider.url. This is an environment property whose value  specifies configuration information for the service provider to use.   Both property names are conveniently contained in two static fields in the Context interface. They  are Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY and Context.PROVIDER_URL, respectively.   For the purpose of accessing an enterprise bean, you need to add these two properties to a  java.util.Properties method using its put method, as you see in the following code:   import java.util.Properties;        Create a java.util.Properties object   Properties properties = new Properties  ;        Add two properties: "java.naming.factory.initial" and      "java.naming.provider.url"   properties.put Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY,     "org.jnp.interfaces.NamingContextFactory" ;   properties.put Context.PROVIDER_URL, "localhost:1099" ;   Because these properties are needed when creating an initial context, the Properties object is  passed to the InitialContext class's constructor, as follows:   javax.naming.InitialContext jndiContext =     new javax.naming.InitialContext properties ;   To sum up, obtaining a reference to an enterprise bean involves the following steps:   1.  Creating a java.util.Properties object.  2.  Adding necessary properties to the java.util.Properties object for constructing the initial   context.   3.  Constructing an javax.naming.InitialContext object.  4.  Using the javax.naming.Context interface's lookup method to get a reference to the bean's   home object, passing the name of the bean.      543      The summary can be rewritten in the following code:   import java.util.Properties;   import javax.naming.*;     Properties properties = new Properties  ;   properties.put Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY,     "org.jnp.interfaces.NamingContextFactory" ;   properties.put Context.PROVIDER_URL, "localhost:1099" ;     try {    InitialContext jndiContext = new InitialContext properties ;        get the reference to the home interface     Object ref  = jndiContext.lookup "Adder" ;   }   catch  NamingException e  {  }      Creating a Bean's Instance   Using JNDI, you managed to obtain a reference to the bean's home object. The next step is to  create an instance of the bean on the server. This is done using the home interface's create method.   The reference you got to the bean's home object, however, is an RMI object of type  java.lang.Object. To call the create method of the home object, you first need to downcast the  object reference into the type of the home interface. For example, in the Adder bean example, the  code for the downcasting looks like this:   AdderHome home =  AdderHome  ref;   In this example, ref is the reference obtained from the JNDI initial context's name lookup.   To conform with RMI-IIOP, you must use another method for the previous downcasting.  Typically, you use the static narrow method of the javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject class. This  method is used to ensure that an object of a remote or abstract interface type can be cast to a  desired type. The signature of this method is as follows:   public static Object narrow Object narrowFrom, Class narrowTo      throws ClassCastException   Here, narrowFrom is the object to check and the narrowTo is the desired type. If narrowFrom  cannot be cast to narrowTo, a ClassCastException object is thrown. If narrowFrom can be cast to  narrowTo, the method returns an object of type Object that can be cast to the desired type. Your  code then becomes the following:   AdderHome home =  AdderHome      PortableRemoteObject.narrow  ref, AdderHome.class ;   Having a home object, you then can call the create method of the home interface to create the bean,  as follows:   Adder adder = home.create  ;      544      You are then free to call any exposed methods of the bean. For the Adder bean example, you can  call its add method, as follows:   Now let's see how to create client applications based on what you've learned so far.   int I = adder.add 2, 5 ;   A Java Client Application   The following is a class called BeanClient that calls the Adder session bean you have previously  created. The code is very simple and is given in Listing 28.5.   Listing 28.5 The Client Application Class   import javax.naming.*;   import javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject;   import java.util.Properties;   import com.brainysoftware.ejb.Adder;   import com.brainysoftware.ejb.AdderHome;     public class BeanClient {      public static void main String[] args  {         preparing properties for constructing an InitialContext object       Properties properties = new Properties  ;       properties.put Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY,   "org.jnp.interfaces.NamingContextFactory" ;       properties.put Context.PROVIDER_URL, "localhost:1099" ;         try {           Get an initial context         InitialContext jndiContext = new InitialContext properties ;         System.out.println "Got context" ;              Get a reference to the Bean         Object ref  = jndiContext.lookup "Adder" ;         System.out.println "Got reference" ;              Get a reference from this to the Bean's Home interface         AdderHome home =  AdderHome            PortableRemoteObject.narrow  ref, AdderHome.class ;              Create an Adder object from the Home interface         Adder adder = home.create  ;         System.out.println  "2 + 5 = " + adder.add 2, 5  ;       }       catch Exception e  {        System.out.println e.toString   ;       }     }   }   It is assumed that the client application will run on the same computer as the EJB container. If you  run it from a different computer, you need to replace "localhost:1099" with the URL of the naming  service on the server.   If you are using JBoss, when you run the client class, you need to include the following files in the  classpath:      545                client ejb.jar  client jboss-client.jar  client jnp-client.jar             client ejb.jar  client jboss-client.jar  client jnp-client.jar   The lib and client directories are located under JBoss home.   Calling the Bean from a JSP Page   Calling an enterprise bean from a servlet is basically the same as calling it from another client.  Copying all the necessary library files into lib directory under Tomcat is important, however. The  following files are needed from the JBoss's home directory:   Finally, copy the Adder.jar to the lib directory under CATALINA_HOME. Alternatively, deploy  the class files under WEB-INF classes com brainysoft-ware ejb  directory under the application  directory. We need the Adder.class and AdderHome.class.   The code for the JSP page is given in Listing 28.6.

You also  have learned how to write and deploy your own EJB application, review the javax.ejb package,  and write two client applications. For the uninitiated, this chapter also provided a brief  introduction to JNDI, which is used by the client to access an enterprise bean.      547      Chapter 29. The Session Bean   This chapter presents the first type of enterprise bean, called the session bean, by first explaining  what a session bean is and then discussing two types of session beans: stateful and stateless. After  a discussion of the API, you develop the Tassie project, a simple EJB  Enterprise JavaBeans   application that demonstrates the use of session beans and shows how to write a client application  that uses the bean.       What Is a Session Bean?   A session bean is an enterprise bean that implements business logic for its clients. For example, a  session bean can perform calculations  as you saw in the example in Chapter 28, "Enterprise  JavaBeans" , process orders, encrypt and decrypt data, connect to a database, search data in a  database, and so on.   In an EJB application in which the client is a web application, the business logic can reside in the  web application itselfâeither in servlets or JSP pages. Using session beans as components that  encapsulate the business logic makes the components reusable by other types of clients and  enables them to enjoy benefits offered by the Enterprise JavaBean container, as discussed in  Chapter 28.   Session beans are so called because they live as long as the client's session using them. A session  bean is created when a client requires its service. When the client finishes with the bean and  disconnects, the session bean may be destroyed by the EJB container.   Because object creation is an expensive operation, a session bean may not really be destroyed in  the EJB container after the bean services a client. Instead, the container may place the bean in a  pool to be quickly made available to another client that requests it later. This is not a concern of  the client application developer, however; the EJB container manages the life cycle of a session  bean.   Warning   Similar to other enterprise beans, a session bean's method is not instantiated or called  directly by the client. A client communicates with the session bean through the session's  bean home and remote interfaces.   Session beans are not persisted into a permanent storage, such as a disk or a database.  When the server crashes, session beans disappear with all other data in temporary storage.       Stateful and Stateless Session Beans   You will work with two types of session beans: stateful and stateless. An instance of a stateful  session bean is associated with a single client. The EJB container always uses the same stateful  session bean instance to service a given client. The stateful session bean retains data related to the  client that is retrieved from the database or information entered by the client. An instance of a      548                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       stateful session bean is said to hold the conversational state of the client. A client session ends  when the client specifies that it no longer needs the stateful session bean or after a certain period  of time lapses since the last method invocation by the client. A stateful session bean is analogous  to the javax.servlet.http.HttpSession object in a servlet JSP application.   In contrast, a stateless session object is not client specific. This type of bean does not hold a  conversational state of the client. The EJB container may delegate a method invocation by a client  to any stateless session bean available in the pool.   Passivation and Activation of Stateful Session Beans   As previously mentioned, the EJB container maintains a pool of stateless and stateful session  beans. This is because object creation is expensive and the pool makes a session bean reusable.   Although the EJB container can easily place a stateless session bean in a pool and take it back  when the bean is needed, pooling a stateful session bean is not that simple. This is so because a  stateful session bean retains the client-specific data.   Suppose that a stateful session bean is servicing a client, and it takes a while for the client to come  back. If the EJB container does not have many clients at that time, the stateful session bean can  wait until the client comes back. On a busy day, however, the EJB container may have more  clients than the number of stateful session beans. The stateful session bean sitting idle waiting for  its client to come back may have to be called to service another client. But, what about the  conversational state of the previous client it is holding? You can't just discard the conversational  state because the client may come back. At the same time, sitting idle waiting is a waste of  resources in the EJB container.   The EJB container solves this problem by introducing two processes called passivation and  activation. In passivation, the conversational state of a stateful session bean sitting idle waiting for  its client to come back is transferred to secondary storage, such as hard disk space.   Activation is the reverse of passivation. The activation process loads into a stateful session bean  the conversational state of a previous client coming back to continue its session. Note that the EJB  container does not have to use the same instance of the stateful session bean that serviced the  client previously. As long as the conversational state of the client can be loaded intact, any bean  instance can take the job. The previous stateful session bean instance is probably busy servicing  another client, anyway.   A Stateful Session Bean's Session   The EJB container assigns a unique identifier for each stateful session bean object at the creation  of the bean. Unlike a session in a servlet JSP application, however, session identifiers in an EJB  application are not exposed to the client. The client has no way to obtain a session identifier. A  client can determine whether two session bean object references refer to the same instance by  using the isIdentical method of the javax.ejb.EJBObject interface. The signature of this method is  as follows:   public boolean isIdentical javax.ejb.EJBObject object      throws java.rmi.RemoteException      Writing a Session Bean      549      In Chapter 28, you learned how to write a stateless session bean, deploy it, and call it from two  client applications. Earlier, you might not have understood the technicalities going on in that  application; now, however, you will learn more about the process.   To review briefly, you need to write at least three classes for a session bean to function:      The home interface     The remote interface     The session bean class   An instance of the home interface is called a home object, and an instance of the remote interface  is known as a remote object.   The reason you need a home interface and a remote interface for each session bean is that the  client does not create the bean directly, nor does a client invoke a session bean's method directly.   A home object is required for the client to create an instance of the session bean. When an EJB  client application creates an instance of a session bean by invoking one of the home object's create  methods, it refers to the procedure in which the EJB container allocates an instance of the  requested session bean for the client. Whether the EJB container really creates a new instance of  the session bean or simply takes one from the pool is not the client application's problem.   A remote object is returned when an EJB client application invokes the create method of the home  object. The remote object is needed because it is the remote representation of the session bean.  Remember that the client application does not have direct access to the session bean. Once you get  the remote object, you can call any method exposed by the session bean. Therefore, a remote  interface must clone all the methods in the session bean that are supposed to be available to an  EJB client.   The client view of a session bean deployed in an EJB container is depicted in Figure 29.1.   Figure 29.1. Client view of a session bean.   The javax.ejb.SessionBean Interface      550         A session bean must extend the javax.ejb.SessionBean interface. This interface extends the  javax.ejb.EnterpriseBean interface and provides four methods that are invoked by the EJB  container. The four methods are as follows:   ejbActivate. The EJB container invokes this method when the session bean instance is  retrieved from the pool to service a client whose conversational state has been stored in  secondary storage in the previous passivation process. You should write code in this  method that re-acquires resources that have been released in the previous passivation. The  signature of this method is as follows:   public void ejbActivate   throws javax.ejb.EJBException,  java.rmi.RemoteException;   ejbPassivate. The EJB container invokes this method when the session bean instance is  about to be passivated. You should provide implementation code that releases resources  such as a database connection. This method has the following signature:   public void ejbPassivate   throws javax.ejb.EJBException,  java.rmi.RemoteException;   ejbRemove. This method is invoked when a client calls a remove method or when the  EJB container decides to ends the session object after it times out. The signature of this  method is as follows:   public void ejbRemove   throws javax.ejb.EJBException,  java.rmi.RemoteException;   setSessionContext. The EJB container invokes this method after the instance has been  created, passing a javax.ejb.SessionContext object. If you need to use the SessionContext  object at a later stage, you should assign it to the bean's class-level object variable. The  signature of this method is as follows:  javax.ejb.EJBException,   java.rmi.RemoteException;   public void setSessionContext SessionContext context  throws   An Example of a Session Bean   A session bean looks like the code in Listing 29.1. Because it implements the  javax.ejb.SessionBean interface, you need to provide implementation for all the methods in that  interface, plus the methods that implement the business logic.   Listing 29.1 A Session Bean Called MySessionBean   import java.rmi.RemoteException;   import javax.ejb.SessionBean;   import javax.ejb.SessionContext;     public class MySessionBean implements SessionBean {      public void ejbCreate   {    }       public void ejbRemove   {    }       public void ejbActivate   {   551                               }       public void ejbPassivate   {    }       public void setSessionContext SessionContext sc  {    }          implementation methods here   }   The javax.ejb.SessionContext Interface and the  javax.ejb.EJBContext Interface   As mentioned in the previous section, the EJB container passes a javax.ejb.SessionContext object  to the setSessionContext method of the javax.ejb.SessionBean interface. The SessionContext  interface extends the javax.ejb.EJBContext interface that provides useful methods to obtain  information about the caller client application, the bean home object, the environment, and so on.   The definition of the javax.ejb.EJBContext interface is as follows:   public interface javax.ejb.EJBObject     extends java.rmi.Remote {      public javax.ejb.EJBHome getEJBHome         throws java.rmi.RemoteException;       public java.lang.Object getPrimaryKey         throws java.rmi.RemoteException;       public void remove         throws java.rmi.RemoteException, javax.ejb.RemoveException;       public javax.ejb.Handle getHandle         throws java.rmi.RemoteException;       public boolean isIdentical javax.ejb.EJBObject object        throws java.rmi.RemoteException;     }   The definition of the javax.ejb.SessionContext interface is as follows:   public interface javax.ejb.SessionContext     extends javax.ejb.EJBContext {      public javax.ejb.EJBLocalObject getEJBLocalObject         throws IllegalStateException;       public javax.ejb.EJBObject getEJBObject         throws IllegalStateException;     }   Using a Stateful Session Bean from a Servlet JSP Page   A non-web client of a stateful session bean should not have a problem retaining the reference to  the bean for the life of the session. A web client is a different case because HTTP is a stateless      552      protocol, making it difficult to maintain the session. One convenient way of retaining a session in  an EJB application from a servlet JSP page is to use the javax.servlet.http.HttpSession object. You  can retain the session to a stateful session bean by following these two rules:   1.  The first time you obtain a reference to a stateful session bean, store it as an attribute in  2.  HttpSession session = request.getSession true ;    the javax.servlet.http.HttpSession object, as you see here:  session.setAttribute "cart", cartBean ;   This code obtains an HttpSession object from the request object and then adds the  cartBean object to the session object's attribute.   If you are writing the code in a JSP page, you don't need the first line of the code shown  in the previous example because session is an implicit object in JSP.   3.  The next time you need to access the session bean object, you obtain the object reference   from the HttpSession object, as follows:   HttpSession session = request.getSession true ;  Cart cartBean =  Cart  session.getAttribute "cart" ;   The sample application shows you how to use these code fragments.   Deployment Descriptor   Each EJB application must have a deployment descriptor, which is an XML document named ejb- jar.xml. The descriptor's root element is  , and it contains a node called <enterprise- beans>. Each session bean is then registered under this element and called a   element.  Therefore, one   element is created for each session bean.   Note      Note   The DTD for EJB 2.0 applications' deployment descriptor can be found at  http:  java.sun.com dtd ejb-jar_2_0.dtd.   The   element has the following syntax:   <! ELEMENT session  description?, display-name?, small-icon?, large- icon?, ejb-name,   home?, remote?, local-home?, local?, ejb-class, session-type,  transaction-type,   env-entry*, ejb-ref*, ejb-local-ref*, security-role-ref*, security- identity?,   resource-ref*, resource-env-ref* >   In this element, ? indicates an optional subelement and * indicates that the preceding subelement  can be repeated zero or more times. The subelements are explained in the following list:      description. The description of the bean.     display-name. The short name to be displayed by tools used to edit this deployment   descriptor.      553                  small-icon. The name of a small  16 x 16  icon image in .gif or .jpg format. The filename  is a relative path within the ejb-jar file.  large-icon. The name of a large  32 x 32  icon image in .gif or .jpg format. The filename  is a relative path within the ejb-jar file.  ejb-name. The name identifying the session bean. The name must be unique throughout  the ejb-jar file.      home. The fully qualified name for the home interface.                                    remote. The fully qualified name for the remote interface.  local-home. The fully qualified name for the local home interface.  local. The fully qualified name for the bean's local interface.  ejb-class. The fully qualified name for the bean class.  session-type. The type of the session bean. Its value is either Stateless or Stateful.  transaction-type. The type of transaction. Its value is either Bean or Container.  env-entry. The name of the bean's environment entry.  ejb-ref. The declaration of a reference to a bean's home.  ejb-local-ref. The declaration of a reference to a bean's local home.  security-role-ref. The declaration of a security role reference in the bean's code.  security-identity. Whether the caller's security identity is to be used for the execution of  the methods of the bean or a specific run-as identity is to be used.  resource-ref. The declaration of the bean's reference to an external resource.  resource-env-ref. The declaration of a bean's reference to an administered object  associated with a resource in the bean's environment.          An example of a deployment descriptor follows:                The Search Bean for Tassie Online  Bookstore       Search Bean                         Search           com.brainysoftware.tassie.ejb.SearchHome           com.brainysoftware.tassie.ejb.Search           com.brainysoftware.tassie.ejb.SearchBean           Stateless           Bean                         The Tassie Online Bookstore Example   The following application is called the Tassie Online Bookstore. The example is an incomplete e- commerce application whose sole purpose is to illustrate the use of session beans in an EJB  application accessed by a web application. Because this is an application that serves only as a  learning tool, the code used here does not provide the efficiency or whole functionality of a true e- commerce application.   This sample application uses four servlets as its user interface. The four servlets represent the four  pages of user interface: the Search page, the Book Details page, the Add To Cart page, and the      554      Check Shopping Cart page. The diagram explaining the relationships among those pages is given  in Figure 29.2.   Figure 29.2. The four pages of the Tassie Online Bookstore application.   The project's functionality is listed here:         A web user can search for a book based on its title by entering a keyword in the Search   page. All books whose title contains the keyword are then listed in an HTML table. Each  book's, title, author, and publisher is displayed. In addition, there is a fourth item called  details that displays more details of a selected book.   The Search page is shown in Figures 29.3 and 29.4. Figure 29.3 shows the initial  appearance of the pageâwhat the users see when they request the page.   Figure 29.3. The initial Search page.      555      Figure 29.4. The Search page with search results.         Figure 29.4 shows the same Search page after a user performs a search by entering the  word "computer" as the search string. Note that each title includes a link to the Book  Details page.      556         The user can click the details hyperlink of a book to go to the Book Details page. In this  page, the user can enter the number of copies of the title to be purchased. Afterwards, the  user clicks the Buy button. The Book Details page is shown in Figure 29.5.   Figure 29.5. The Book Details page.      After the user clicks the Buy button in the Book Details page, the application notifies the   user that the book has been placed in the shopping cart. This is shown in Figure 29.6.   Figure 29.6. The Add To Cart page.         557         Clicking the link in the Add To Cart page brings the user to the Search page again where  the user can continue searching for other books. The other option is to check the shopping  cart by clicking the link at the bottom of the Search page. This brings the user to the  Shopping Cart Details page, whose screenshot is given in Figure 29.7.   Figure 29.7. The ShoppingCartDetails page.         The Database      558                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       The database for this example is very simple, consisting of only a table called Books. This table  has the following fields:   Id. A unique identifier for each book.         Title. The title of the book.     Author. The book's author.     Publisher. The company that published the book.     Price. The retail price for each book.   The database structure has been made as easy as possible. Notice that there is no field to list the  ISBN numbers of the books. Additionally, you do not need to enter a book category. In a real- world e-commerce application, you would want to normalize the tables, which is something you  don't do here.   The sample database is given in a Microsoft Access format and can be found in the CD that  accompanies this book. You access the database through the JDBC-ODBC bridge. You must first  create a Data Source Name  DSN  for this database named TassieDB.   The Enterprise Beans   The sample application consists of two stateless session beans and one stateful session bean, each  of which is discussed in the following sections.   The Search Stateless Session Bean   The first session bean, called Search, finds all the books whose titles match the search keyword.  The home interface for this session bean is given in Listing 29.2 and its remote interface is given  in Listing 29.3.   Listing 29.2 The Home Interface of the Search Session Bean   package com.brainysoftware.tassie.ejb;     import java.rmi.RemoteException;   import javax.ejb.CreateException;   import javax.ejb.EJBHome;     public interface SearchHome extends EJBHome {    Search create   throws RemoteException, CreateException;   }   Listing 29.3 The Remote Interface of the Search Session Bean   package com.brainysoftware.tassie.ejb;     import javax.ejb.EJBObject;   import java.rmi.RemoteException;   import java.util.ArrayList;     public interface Search extends EJBObject {    public ArrayList search String keyword  throws RemoteException;   }   From the remote interface, you know that there is only one method exposed to the client: search.  This method accepts a String representing the search keyword and returns an ArrayList containing      559   all the books that match the search string. Each book in the ArrayList is represented in an array of  String.      The bean class is given in Listing 29.4.   Listing 29.4 The Search Bean Class   package com.brainysoftware.tassie.ejb;     import java.rmi.RemoteException;   import javax.ejb.SessionBean;   import javax.ejb.SessionContext;   import java.sql.*;   import java.util.ArrayList;     public class SearchBean implements SessionBean {        private Connection getConnection   {      Connection connection = null;       try {        Class.forName "sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver" ;         connection = DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:odbc:TassieDB" ;       }       catch  Exception e  {      }       return connection;     }       public ArrayList search String keyword  {      ArrayList retval = new ArrayList 50 ;       try {        Statement statement = getConnection  .createStatement  ;         String sql = "SELECT Id, Title, Author, Publisher" +           " FROM Books" +           " WHERE Title LIKE '%" + keyword + "%'";           ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery sql ;         while  rs.next    {          String[] row = new String[4];           row[0] = rs.getString "Id" ;           row[1] = rs.getString "Title" ;           row[2] = rs.getString "Author" ;           row[3] = rs.getString "Publisher" ;           retval.add row ;         }         rs.close  ;         statement.close  ;       }       catch  Exception e  {      }       return retval;     }       public void ejbCreate   {    }     public void ejbRemove   {    }       public void ejbActivate   {      560        }       public void ejbPassivate   {    }       public void setSessionContext SessionContext sc  {    }   }   The BookDetails Stateless Session Bean   The second session bean is also stateless and is called BookDetails. Its function is to return the  details of a book given a book id. This bean is called from a servlet as well as from another bean,  representing a remote client and a local client. In this example, you see the difference in the code  for a remote client and a local client.   The home interface for the bean is given in Listing 29.5 and its remote interface is given in Listing  29.6.   Listing 29.5 The Home Interface of the BookDetails Bean   package com.brainysoftware.tassie.ejb;     import java.rmi.RemoteException;   import javax.ejb.CreateException;   import javax.ejb.EJBHome;     public interface BookDetailsHome extends EJBHome {    BookDetails create   throws RemoteException, CreateException;   }   Listing 29.6 The Remote Interface of the BookDetails Bean   package com.brainysoftware.tassie.ejb;     import javax.ejb.EJBObject;   import java.rmi.RemoteException;   import java.util.ArrayList;     public interface BookDetails extends EJBObject {    public String[] getBookDetails String bookId  throws  RemoteException;   }   Again, only one method is exposed to its client: the getBookDetails method. This method accepts  a String representing the book identifier and returns an array of String containing the book id, the  title, the author, the publisher, and the price. Listing 29.7 lists the BookDetails bean class  implementation.   Listing 29.7 The BookDetailsBean Class   package com.brainysoftware.tassie.ejb;     import java.rmi.RemoteException;   import javax.ejb.SessionBean;   import javax.ejb.SessionContext;   import java.sql.*;   import java.util.ArrayList;       561        public class BookDetailsBean implements SessionBean {        private Connection getConnection   {      Connection connection = null;       try {        Class.forName "sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver" ;         connection = DriverManager.getConnection "jdbc:odbc:TassieDB" ;       }       catch  Exception e  {      }       return connection;     }       public String[] getBookDetails String bookId  {      String[] row = null;       try {        Statement statement = getConnection  .createStatement  ;         String sql = "SELECT Id, Title, Author, Publisher, Price" +           " FROM Books" +           " WHERE Id=" + bookId;           ResultSet rs = statement.executeQuery sql ;         if  rs.next    {          row = new String[5];           row[0] = rs.getString "Id" ;           row[1] = rs.getString "Title" ;           row[2] = rs.getString "Author" ;           row[3] = rs.getString "Publisher" ;           row[4] = rs.getString "Price" ;         }         rs.close  ;         statement.close  ;       }       catch  Exception e  {      }       return row;     }       public void ejbCreate   {    }       public void ejbRemove   {    }       public void ejbActivate   {    }       public void ejbPassivate   {    }       public void setSessionContext SessionContext sc  {    }   }   The Cart Stateful Session Bean   The Cart session bean is a stateful one that enables you to maintain a shopping cart for each user.  You can add an item to the Cart bean and you can retrieve the bean to check what's inside.      562      The home interface and remote interface for this bean are given in Listings 29.8 and Listing 29.9,  respectively.   Listing 29.8 The Home Interface for the Cart Bean   package com.brainysoftware.tassie.ejb;     import java.rmi.RemoteException;   import javax.ejb.CreateException;   import javax.ejb.EJBHome;     public interface CartHome extends EJBHome {    Cart create   throws RemoteException, CreateException;   }   Listing 29.9 The Remote Interface for the Cart Bean   package com.brainysoftware.tassie.ejb;     import javax.ejb.EJBObject;   import java.rmi.RemoteException;   import java.util.ArrayList;     public interface Cart extends EJBObject {    public ArrayList getCart   throws RemoteException;     public void addToCart String bookId, String quantity  throws   RemoteException;   }   The addToCart method accepts two arguments: bookId selected by the user and the number of  copies the user would like to purchase. The addToCart method returns no value.   The second method, getCart, returns the shopping cart in the form of an ArrayList. Note that you  don't pass a user identifier or other tokens to the method to obtain the current shopping cart  because the conversational state for each user is retained by this stateful bean.   The bean class is given in Listing 29.10.   Listing 29.10 The Bean Class for the Cart Bean   package com.brainysoftware.tassie.ejb;     import java.rmi.RemoteException;   import javax.ejb.SessionBean;   import javax.ejb.SessionContext;   import java.sql.*;   import java.util.*;   import javax.naming.*;     public class CartBean implements SessionBean {  public void addToCart String bookId, String quantity  {      private ArrayList cart = new ArrayList  ;      String[] row = new String[6];       row[0] = bookId;       row[1] = quantity;         try {        InitialContext jndiContext = new InitialContext  ;       563            Object ref = jndiContext.lookup "BookDetails" ;         System.out.println "Got ref to BookDetails" ;            don't need to use javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject            because this is a local client         BookDetailsHome home =  BookDetailsHome  ref;         System.out.println "Got home to BookDetails" ;         BookDetails bookDetails = home.create  ;         System.out.println "Got BookDetails" ;         String[] details = bookDetails.getBookDetails bookId ;         row[2] = details[1];         row[3] = details[2];         row[4] = details[3];         row[5] = details[4];       }       catch  Exception e  {        System.out.println e.toString   ;       }       cart.add row ;       }       public ArrayList getCart   {    return cart;     }       public void ejbCreate   {    }       public void ejbRemove   {    }       public void ejbActivate   {    }       public void ejbPassivate   {    }       public void setSessionContext SessionContext sc  {    }   }   The EJB Application Deployment Descriptor   The three beans described earlier need a deployment descriptor as given in Listing 29.11.

Creating the Deployment File   After you have compiled all the three session beans and placed the deployment descriptor in the  META-INF directory, you are ready to generate a deployment file for the EJB application.   Assuming that the jar.exe program has been available from any directory in the computer, type the  following to create a jar file called tassie.jar.   jar cfv tassie.jar com brainysoftware tassie ejb * META-INF ejb- jar.xml   Deployment in JBoss cannot be easier. JBoss supports what is called hot deploy. This means that  to deploy an EJB application, you just need to copy the jar file into its deploy directory. You don't  even need to restart JBoss if it's already running.   Together, the four servletsâSearchServlet, BookDetailsServlet, AddToCartServlet, and  CheckCartServletârepresent a client application that uses the session beans in the Tassie Online  Bookstore application. Each of the servlets is explained in this section.   The SearchServlet displays the Search page. The Search page is the main page as well as the first  page the user will see. The page can be partitioned into three parts:   Deploying in JBoss   The Servlets   The SearchServlet Servlet      The search form     The search result table      565         The Check Shopping Cart link   The code for the SearchServlet servlet is given in Listing 29.12.

Chapter 16, "Application Deployment," explains all that you need to  do to deploy a web application.       Summary   This chapter introduced you to the session bean. There are two types of session beans: stateful and  stateless. This chapter also presented how to write a session bean and a deployment descriptor for  an EJB application.   An example describing an EJB application accessed from a web application was given in the  Tassie Online Bookstore example. This application showed how you can access stateless and  stateful session beans and maintain sessions using the javax.servlet.http.HttpSession objects.      572      Chapter 30. Entity Beans   Chapter 28, "Enterprise JavaBeans," discussed the Enterprise JavaBeans  EJB  in general and  Chapter 29, "The Session Bean, explained the session bean and presented a fragment of an e- commerce web application that uses both stateful and stateless session beans. You should now be  familiar with how EJB works and know how to write, package, and deploy session beans.   Session beans, however, are only a third of the story. There are two more types of EJB: entity  beans and message-driven beans. This chapter explains the entity bean and shows you how to  write entity beans for your applications. Chapter 33 explains how to work with message-driven  beans.     What Is an Entity Bean?   An entity bean is a data component that persists the data permanently to a secondary storage such  as a database. Like another Java class, an entity bean has fields and methods. It uses fields to store  data and methods to perform operations on the fields.   In an EJB application, an entity bean is a view to a record of a database table. Instead of  manipulating data in a database directly as you would in non-EJB applications, you manipulate an  entity bean that represents a piece of data.   The EJB container then takes care of the synchronization and other tasks in maintaining the data.  An entity bean lives as long as the data it represents; therefore, an entity bean could last for weeks,  months, or even years. For example, if an entity bean represents a bank account, chances are that it  lives as long as the bank account resides in the bank's back-end database. Because a bank account  normally is opened and retained for years by the bank, the entity bean representing it also lives for  years.   Why do you need an object, such as an entity bean, to store data in the first place? Why don't you  access the database directly and manipulate the data in it? Or, why not just write session beans to  access the data like you did in Chapter 29 ? The answer to these questions is twofold. First,  managing data as objects is easier. Second, the EJB container provides services that make it much  easier to deal with data represented by entity beans.   Having learned about session beans in the previous chapter, you might be wondering how entity  beans and session beans are different. Why is a different type of enterprise bean needed? Put  simply, a session bean models a business process, and an entity bean represents business data. The  EJB container knows how to synchronize the data in an entity bean with the underlying data in the  database that the entity bean represents. In addition, an entity bean survives server crash.   Two types of entity beans exist: entity beans with bean-managed persistence  BMP  and entity  beans with container-managed persistence  CMP . Both are discussed later in this chapter, after a  general overview of an entity bean.   Just like a session bean, an entity bean must be accompanied by several files you write in addition  to the entity bean. Those files are as follows:      The remote interface     The home interface     The primary key class      573         The entity bean     The deployment descriptor       The Remote Interface   The following sections discuss each of these files. The deployment descriptor is explained in the  sections that discuss each type of the entity bean: "Writing a BMP Entity Bean," and "Writing a  CMP Entity Bean."   The remote interface of an entity bean enables a client to access the instance of an entity bean. An  entity bean's remote interface must extend the javax.ejb.EJBObject interface. In the remote  interface, the entity bean developer defines methods that can be called by the bean's client. For  example, the remote interface of an entity bean that represents a product might have two methods  called getPrice and getCategory, as in the following snippet:   public interface Product extends javax.ejb.EJBObject {    double getPrice int productId  throws java.rmi.RemoteException;     int getCategory int productId  throws java.rmi.RemoteException;   }   The getPrice method returns the price of the product and the getCategory method returns the  identifier of the category the product falls into. The client can use the remote interface to do the  following:      Obtain the home interface for the entity object     Remove the entity object     Obtain the entity object's primary key     Obtain the entity object's handle   Note   An entity object refers to an instance of an entity bean.     The Home Interface   An entity bean's client obtains the home objectâthat is, an instance of the home interfaceâfrom  an entity bean's remote object. The client uses the home object to do the following:      Create an entity object     Remove an entity object     Find an entity object     Obtain the javax.ejb.EJBMetaData interface for an entity bean   The home interface enables the client to do these tasks by providing create, finder, and remove  methods. These methods are discussed in the following sections.   Create Methods      574      A home interface can have zero or more create methods. The home interface can have more than  one create method to allow various ways of creating an entity object. For example, following is  the create method of the home interface of an entity bean called Product. It allows the user to  create a Product entity bean by passing the product identifier, the product name, the description,  and the price:   public interface ProductHome extends javax.ejb.EJBHome {      public Product create int productId, String productName,       String description, double price        throws java.rmi.RemoteException, javax.ejb.CreateException;     .     .     .   }   Note   Finder Methods   A create method can throw a java.rmi.RemoteException and a javax.ejb.CreateException.   Because an entity bean represents a piece of data, one of the most frequently used operations is  finding an entity bean. You find an entity bean by using one of the finder methods. In contrast, a  session bean does not have a finder method.   A home interface must define a findByPrimaryKey method to enable the client to find an entity  object by passing a primary key. In addition, a home interface can have other finder methods. For  example, a Product entity bean's home interface might also define the findByName or findByPrice  methods to allow the user to find an entity object by passing its name or its price. Although a  findByPrimaryKey method always returns either zero or one entity bean that meets the criteria,  other finder methods may return multiple values.   For finder methods that may return multiple values, the return value types for these methods are  either java.util.Collection or java.util.Enumeration.   As an example, the following home interface for an entity bean called Product defines three finder  methods:     public interface ProductHome extends javax.ejb.EJBHome {        public Product findByPrimaryKey String productId          throws java.rmi.RemoteException, javax.ejb.FinderException;         public Enumeration findByProductName String productName          throws java.rmi.RemoteException, javax.ejb.FinderException;         public Collection findAll         throws java.rmi.RemoteException, javax.ejb.FinderException;       .     .     .   }   Remove Methods      575      A remove method is used to remove an entity object. The home interface of an entity bean is  derived from the javax.ejb.EJBHome interface, which defines two remove methods. The  signatures of the two remove methods are given as follows:   void remove javax.ejb.Handle handle      throws java.rmi.RemoteException, javax.ejb.RemoveException;   void remove Object primaryKey      throws java.rmi.RemoteException, javax.ejb.RemoveException;      The Primary Key Class   Similar to a database table, which can have a primary key for uniquely identifying each row on the  table, an entity bean also has a primary key. The type of the primary key class of an entity bean  must be one of those types in RMI-IIOP.     The Entity Bean   An entity bean class must implement the javax.ejb.EntityBean interface. This interface defines  methods that determine the life cycle of the bean as well as other callback methods that are called  by the EJB container. This section looks at this interface in detail and then elaborates some  important functionality of an entity bean. At the end of the section, you also look at the  javax.ejb.EntityContext interface.   The javax.ejb.EntityBean Interface   This interface extends the javax.ejb.EnterpriseBean interface and provides callback methods that  are invoked by the EJB container. The methods of the EntityBean interface are as follows:   ejbActivate. The EJB container invokes this method when the entity bean instance is  retrieved from the pool to become associated with a specific entity object. The signature  of this method is as follows:   public void ejbActivate   throws javax.ejb.EJBException,  java.rmi.RemoteException;   ejbPassivate. The EJB container invokes this method when the entity bean instance's  association with its entity object is about to be broken. This method has the following  signature:   public void ejbPassivate   throws javax.ejb.EJBException,  java.rmi.RemoteException;   ejbLoad. This method is invoked by the EJB container to synchronize the entity bean's  state by loading its state from the underlying data. The ejbLoad method has the following  signature:   public void ejbLoad   throws javax.ejb.EJBException,  java.rmi.RemoteException;                  576                      ejbStore. This method is invoked by the EJB container to synchronize an entity bean's  state with the underlying data. This method is used to store the state back to the  underlying data. The signature of this method is as follows:   public void ejbStore   throws javax.ejb.EJBException,  java.rmi.RemoteException;   ejbRemove. This method is invoked by the EJB container before the EJB container  removes the entity object. This method is invoked when a client calls a remove method on  the entity bean's home interface or remote interface. The signature of this method is as  follows:   public void ejbRemove   throws javax.ejb.EJBException,  java.rmi.RemoteException;   setEntityContext. The EJB container invokes this method after the instance has been  created, setting the associated entity context. The signature of this method is as follows:  public void setEntityContext EntityContext context  throws  javax.ejb.EJBException,   java.rmi.RemoteException;      unsetEntityContext. The EJB container invokes this method before removing the  instance of the entity bean. This method unsets the associated entity context. The  signature of this method is as follows:   public void unsetEntityContext   throws javax.ejb.EJBException,  java.rmi.RemoteException;   Note   The EJB container maintains the synchronization between data in an entity bean's fields  and the underlying database using two methods in the javax.ejb.EntityBean interface:  ejbLoad and ejbStore.   Thanks to the synchronization during the ejbLoad and ejbStore method invocations, if the  data with which an entity bean is associated is changed directly in its underlying database,  the entity bean's state will also reflect the changes. The data in the underlying database  might be changed by another system that manipulates the data directly.   Activation and Passivation   Like a stateful session bean, an entity bean also can undergo the activation and passivation  processes. These processes are more involved in an entity bean than they are in a stateful session  bean, however. With a stateful session bean, activation includes the acquisition of the previous  state and resources for a given client, and passivation requires the bean to release resources it is  holding and save the conversation state of a client to a secondary storage.   In an entity bean, passivation includes releasing resources as well as pushing back the data it is  holding to the underlying database prior to the passivation process. To save the entity bean's state,  the EJB container calls the bean's ejbStore method before passivation. Activation in an entity bean,  on the other hand, includes acquisition of resources as well as grabbing data from the underlying  database. To load data from the underlying database, the EJB container invokes the ejbLoad  method of the entity bean after activation.   Create Methods      577      Every create method in the home interface must have a corresponding create method in the entity  bean class. This corresponding method has the same arguments as the create method in the home  interface; however, the names of the create methods in the entity bean are prefixed with ejb. This  means that in an entity bean class, you have zero or more ejbCreate methods, and in the home  interface, you have the same number of corresponding create methods.   The ejbCreate methods, however, return a value of the primary key class type. Additionally, an  ejbCreate method must be public and must not be declared final or static.   For example, an entity bean named Product has the following ejbCreate method:   public class ProductBean implements javax.ejb.EntityBean {      public String productId;     public String productName;     public String description;     public double price;       public String ejbCreate int productId, String productName,       String description, double price        throws java.rmi.RemoteException, javax.ejb.CreateException {      this.productId = Integer.toString  productId ;       this.productName = productName;       this.description = description;       this.price = price;       return Integer.toString productId ;     }     .     .     .   }   Finder Methods   The entity bean class must have a corresponding finder method of all finder methods in the home  interface. Just like the create methods, a finder method in the entity bean class is prefixed with ejb  and has the same list of arguments as the corresponding finder method in the home interface.   For example, an entity bean class might contain two finder methods: ejbFindByPrimaryKey and  ejbFindByName, as you see here:   public ProductPK ejbFindByPrimaryKey ProductPK primaryKey      throws RemoteException, FinderException {    .     .     .   }     public Enumeration ejbFindByName String name      throws RemoteException, FinderException {    .     .     .   }   In the example, the return type of the ejbFindByPrimaryKey method is ProductPK, which is the  primary key class. The primary key class is explained later in this chapter.      578                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       Remove Methods   An entity bean class also can define a remove method. Like the create and finder methods, the  remove method name is prefixed with ejb. For example, the following is the remove method of a  Product entity bean:   public void ejbRemove       throws java.rmi.RemoteException, javax.ejb.RemoveException {    .     .     .   }   Note   An entity bean is a view to a piece of data in a database. Therefore, invoking the  ejbCreate and the ejbRemove methods has different effects on an entity bean than they  would on a session bean. When the EJB container calls the ejbCreate method of an entity  bean, it creates some data in the underlying database that corresponds to the entity bean  instance in memory. When the EJB container invokes the ejbRemove method of an entity  bean, the EJB container also deletes the data associated with the entity bean from the  underlying database.   Other Methods   The entity bean provides implementations for methods declared in the remote interface. The  methods in the entity bean class must have the same return type and argument list as the  corresponding method in the remote interface. These methods must be public methods and cannot  be static or final. For example, consider the following remote interface:   public interface Product extends javax.ejb.EJBObject {    double getPrice int productId  throws java.rmi.RemoteException;     int getCategory int productId  throws java.rmi.RemoteException;   }   This entity bean has the following methods:   public class ProductBean implements javax.ejb.EntityBean {    double getPrice int productId        throws java.rmi.RemoteException {      .       .       .     }       int getCategory int productId        throws java.rmi.RemoteException {      .       .       .     }       .     .     .   }      579      The javax.ejb.EntityContext Interface   The EntityContext interface is derived from the javax.ejb.EJBContext interface. It defines two  methods: getEJBObject and getPrimaryKey. The getEJBObject method returns a reference to the  enterprise object associated with this instance of the entity bean.   The getPrimaryKey method returns the primary key of the entity object. This method has the  following signature:   The signature of this method is as follows:   javax.ejb.EJBObject getEJBObject       throws IllegalStateException   Object getPrimaryKey       throws IllegalStateException      Two Types of Entity Beans   By now, you should be aware that the whole point of having an entity bean is that it persists data.  Depending on how its data is persisted, an entity bean can be one of these two types:      An entity bean with bean-managed persistence  BMP      An entity bean with container-managed persistence  CMP    An entity bean with BMP takes care of the process of persisting data itself. The bean programmer  can use SQL commands to achieve this.   Data persistence in an entity bean with CMP, however, is taken care of by the EJB container. You  give instructions to the EJB container on how to do this in the deployment descriptor of the EJB  application. For the programmer, entity beans with CMP require fewer lines of code to program.  Entity beans with CMP also are easier to program because there is no more error-prone data  access code.   The difference between these two types of entity beans will become clear after the following two  sections.       Writing a BMP Entity Bean   A BMP entity bean manages its own persistence. At the very basic level, the bean developer must  provide in the entity bean class a method to connect to the underlying database. Alternatively, if a  similar method has been made available in another EJB, the entity bean programmer must write a  method that returns a java.sql.Connection object obtained from the other bean.   The database connection task is somewhat eased in an entity bean, however. The EJB container  loads the database JDBC driver for you. This means that you don't need to use the Class.forName    method to load the driver yourself. You simply tell the EJB container how it can find the JDBC      580      driver. The way in which you do this is application server-specific. In this section, you learn to do  this in JBoss.   The following example demonstrates how you can write a BMP entity bean called Product that  has the underlying data in a database's Products table. To try this example, you need to have a  database and the JDBC driver for that database. This example is developed using a mysql database  and uses a freely downloadable JDBC driver.   Here is the list of things you need to do before you can try the source code:   and Price  with the following SQL statement in your database:   1.  Create a Products table containing four columns  ProductId, ProductName, Description,  2.  CREATE TABLE Products   3.    ProductId int,   4.    ProductName VarChar 50 ,   5.    Description VarChar 100 ,   6.    Price double        7.  Get a JDBC driver for your database. If you are using mysql, you can find a JDBC driver   for mysql in the software mmmysql directory of the CD. The file is called mm.mysql- 2.0.8-bin.jar.   Alternatively, if you want a more recent version, you can visit   http:  sourceforge.net project    showfiles.php?group_id=15923&release_id=63046.   At the time of this writing, the latest version is 2.0.8 and it is packaged in a file named  mm.mysql-2.0.8-you-must-unjar-me.jar.   That's rightâthe .jar file must first be unjarred using the following command, assuming  that you have jar.exe in your path:   jar -xf mm.mysql-2.0.8-you-must-unjar-me.jar   This command produces a subdirectory called mm.mysql-2.0.8 under which there is  another .jar file named mm.mysql-2.0.8-bin.jar.   8.  Configure JDBC Driver in JBoss by following these two steps:   a.  Copy the JDBC driver  the mm.mysql-2.0.8-bin.jar file, if you are using mysql   with the included driver in the CD  into the JBOSSDist lib ext directory.   following lines:   b.  Open the jboss.jcml file under JBossDist conf default directory and find the  c.  d.  e.  f.  g.   <mbean code="org.jboss.jdbc.JdbcProvider"     name="DefaultDomain:service=JdbcProvider">             org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver              Next add "org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver"  or your other driver if you are not using  mysql with the mm JDBC driver  as follows:   <mbean code="org.jboss.jdbc.JdbcProvider"     name="DefaultDomain:service=JdbcProvider">       581                org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver,org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver             9.  Prepare the directory structure in your project. The classes you are going to write here are   part of the com.brainysoftware.ejb package; therefore, you need to have a directory  named com under your working directory, a directory named brainysoftware under the  com directory, and a directory called ejb under the brainysoftware directory. You also  need to have a directory called META-INF under your working directory for your  deployment descriptor. The directory structure is shown in Figure 30.1.   Figure 30.1. The directory structure for your application.      Note   The Remote Interface   All the .class files must be placed under the com brainysoftware ejb directory.   The first class to explore is the remote interface for the Product entity bean with BMP. The class  file is called Product.java and is given in Listing 30.1.   Listing 30.1 The Remote Interface  Product.java    package com.brainysoftware.ejb;     import javax.ejb.EJBObject;   import java.rmi.RemoteException;      * this is the remote interface for Product *    public interface Product extends EJBObject {    public int getProductId   throws RemoteException;     public double getPrice   throws RemoteException;     public String getProductName   throws RemoteException;     public String getDescription   throws RemoteException;   }   The remote interface defines four business methods: getProductId, getPrice, getProductName, and  getDescription.   The Home Interface   The home interface is given in Listing 30.2. The home interface defines a create method that  accepts four arguments and two finder methods. The findByPrimaryKey method accepts a primary  key object  see the following code  and returns a remote object. The findByName method accepts  a product name and returns an Enumeration containing all the products whose product names  match the argument.      582      Listing 30.2 The Home Interface  ProductHome.java    package com.brainysoftware.ejb;     import java.rmi.RemoteException;   import javax.ejb.FinderException;   import javax.ejb.CreateException;   import javax.ejb.EJBHome;   import java.util.Enumeration;     public interface ProductHome extends EJBHome {      public Product create int productId, String productName,       String description, double price        throws RemoteException, CreateException;       public Product findByPrimaryKey ProductPK key        throws RemoteException, FinderException;       public Enumeration findByName String name        throws RemoteException, FinderException;   }   The Primary Key Class   An entity bean has a primary key. The primary key class for the Product entity bean is  com.brainysoftware.ejb.ProductPK. The code for the primary key class is given in Listing 30.3.  Note that it has a public field called productId.   Listing 30.3 ProductPK.java   package com.brainysoftware.ejb;     import java.io.Serializable;     public class ProductPK implements Serializable {        public String productId;       public ProductPK String productId  {      this.productId = productId;     }     public ProductPK   {    }       public boolean equals Object o  {      return true;     }       public int hashCode   {      return 0;     }   }   Note   Note that the equals and hashCode methods do not have real implementations here.      583      The Entity Bean   The entity bean class is the most important class that contains implementations for callback  methods and business methods. It is given in Listing 30.4.

Additionally, it has the implementations of the four business methods  declared in the remote interface: getProductId, getProductName, getDescription, and getPrice, as  you see here:   public int getProductId   {    System.out.println "getProductId" ;     return productId;   }     public String getProductName   {    System.out.println "getProductName" ;     return productName;   }     public String getDescription   {    System.out.println "getDescription" ;     return description;   }   public double getPrice   {    System.out.println "getPrice" ;     return price;   }   An important method that will be used by several other methods in the entity bean class is the  getConnection method, which returns a valid java.sql.Connection object.   As usual, to connect to a database, you need to pass the database URL, the user name, and the  password to the getConnection method of the java.sql.DriverManager class. You can hard-code  this information in the entity bean class; however, this is not a wise tack. The user credentials  change quite often, and hardcoding this information in the entity bean means that you have to  recompile and redeploy the bean every time it changes. A better way is to store this information in  the deployment descriptor and obtain the values using JNDI, as given in the getConnection  method in the entity bean. You see how to store this information in the deployment descriptor later.  For now, just assume that the deployment descriptor contains the database URL, the user name,  and the password to connect to the database.   In the getConnection method in the entity bean, you first define three String object references and  two javax.naming.Context object references called initialContext and environment:   String dbUrl = null;       589      String userName = null;   String password = null;   Context initialContext;   Context environment;   The initialContext variable is used to reference the InitialContext object obtained from the  following constructor:   initialContext = new InitialContext  ;   You then can look up the bean's environment by passing the string "java:comp env" to the lookup  method of the initial context, as follows:   environment =  Context  initialContext.lookup "java:comp env" ;   Then, you can use the environment object to look up the database URL, the user name, and the  password:   dbUrl =  String  environment.lookup "dbUrl" ;   userName =  String  environment.lookup "dbUserName" ;   password =  String  environment.lookup "dbPassword" ;   After you have those values, you can pass them to the getConnection method of the  java.sql.DriverManager object to obtain a Connection object, as you see here:   connection = DriverManager.getConnection dbUrl, userName, password ;   For each create method, the entity bean implements one ejbCreate method and one ejbPostCreate  method.   The ejbCreate method accepts the same set of arguments as defined in the create method in the  home interface and returns the primary key object of the bean. Its signature is given as follows:   public ProductPK ejbCreate int productId, String productName,     String description, double price      throws RemoteException, CreateException {   The ejbCreate method does two things. First, it populates the internal fields with the argument  values passed to it:   this.productId = productId;   this.productName = productName;   this.description = description;   this.price = price;   Next, the method inserts a record into the underlying database. The code for inserting a new  record is as follows. The Connection object is obtained by calling the getConnection method.   Connection con = null;   PreparedStatement ps = null;   try {    String sql = "INSERT INTO Products" +       "  ProductId, ProductName, Description, Price " +       " VALUES" +       "  ?, ?, ?, ? ";     con = getConnection  ;       590        ps = con.prepareStatement sql ;     ps.setInt 1, productId ;     ps.setString 2, productName ;     ps.setString 3, description ;     ps.setDouble 4, price ;     ps.executeUpdate  ;   }   catch  SQLException e  {    System.out.println e.toString   ;   }   finally {    try {      if  ps != null          ps.close  ;       if  con != null          con.close  ;     }     catch  SQLException e  {    }   }   Finally, the method returns a new ProductPK object, as follows:   return new ProductPK Integer.toString productId  ;   The ejbPostCreate method does not return a value and does not do anything except print its name  to the console:   public void ejbPostCreate int productId, String productName,     String description, double price      throws RemoteException, CreateException {    System.out.println "ejbPostCreate" ;   }   The entity bean class has two finder methods: findByPrimaryKey and findByName. The  findByPrimaryKey method accepts a primary key object and checks whether the database contains  a record having that primary key. If a corresponding record is found, the same primary key is  returned; otherwise, the findByPrimaryKey method throws a javax.ejb.ObjectNotFoundException.   The ejbFindByPrimaryKey method starts by composing the SQL statement used to select a record  having the specified product identifier:   String sql = "SELECT ProductName" +     " FROM Products" +     " WHERE ProductId=?";   The product identifier is obtained from the primary key object, as you see here:   int productId = Integer.parseInt primaryKey.productId ;   Then the ejbFindByPrimaryKey method obtains a Connection object, creates a PreparedStatement  object, and calls the PreparedStatement object's executeQuery method:   con = getConnection  ;   ps = con.prepareStatement sql ;   ps.setInt 1, productId ;   rs = ps.executeQuery  ;      591   The executeQuery method returns a ResultSet object. The ResultSet object's next   method returns  true if there is a next record; otherwise, it returns false. If the next   method returns true, the  ejbFindByPrimaryKey method returns the primary key object, as follows:      if  rs.next    {    rs.close  ;     ps.close  ;     con.close  ;     return primaryKey;   }   Otherwise, the method throws an ObjectNotFoundException:   throw new ObjectNotFoundException  ;   The other finder method is named ejbFindByName and returns an Enumeration object containing  all matching products. A Vector object called products is first instantiated, with the following line:   Vector products = new Vector  ;   The ejbFindByName method then opens a connection to grab all products having the specified  name:   try {    String sql = "SELECT ProductId " +       " FROM Products" +       " WHERE ProductName=?";   con = getConnection  ;   ps = con.prepareStatement sql ;   ps.setString 1, name ;   rs = ps.executeQuery  ;   The resulting ResultSet contains all the matching products. Using a while loop, the method then  adds each record to the Vector.     while  rs.next    {      int productId = rs.getInt 1 ;       products.addElement new ProductPK Integer.toString productId   ;     }   }   Then it returns the Enumeration of the Vector:   return products.elements  ;   The entity bean also provides an implementation of the ejbRemove method. When the ejbRemove  method is invoked, it deletes the corresponding record from the database, as you see here:   PreparedStatement ps = null;   try {    String sql = "DELETE FROM Products" +       " WHERE ProductId=?";     ProductPK key =  ProductPK  context.getPrimaryKey  ;     int productId = Integer.parseInt key.productId ;     con = getConnection  ;     ps = con.prepareStatement sql ;     ps.setInt 1, productId ;       592        ps.executeUpdate  ;   }   catch  SQLException e  {    System.out.println e.toString   ;   }   For synchronization between the data in the entity bean and the data in the underlying database,  you also need to provide the implementations of the ejbStore and ejbLoad methods.   The ejbLoad method copies the data from the underlying database to the fields of the entity bean,  as follows:   String sql = "SELECT ProductName, Description, Price" +     " FROM Products" +     " WHERE ProductId=?";   con = getConnection  ;   ps = con.prepareStatement sql ;   ps.setInt 1, this.productId ;   rs = ps.executeQuery  ;   if  rs.next    {    this.productName = rs.getString 1 ;     this.description = rs.getString 2 ;     this.price = rs.getDouble 3 ;   }   The ejbStore method does the reverse. It copies the values of the internal fields to the underlying  database:   String sql = "UPDATE Products" +     " SET ProductName=?, Description=?, Price=?" +     " WHERE ProductId=?";     ProductPK key =  ProductPK  context.getPrimaryKey  ;   int productId = Integer.parseInt key.productId ;   con = getConnection  ;   ps = con.prepareStatement sql ;   ps.setString 1, this.productName ;   ps.setString 2, this.description ;   ps.setDouble 3, this.price ;   ps.setInt 4, productId ;   ps.executeUpdate  ;   Deployment Descriptor   Every EJB application must be accompanied by a deployment descriptor that should be saved into  the META-INF directory of the project, in a file named ejb-jar.xml. The deployment descriptor for  the Product entity bean is given in Listing 30.5.   Listing 30.5 The Deployment Descriptor  ejb-jar.xml                 Your first EJB application        Products Application                         BMPProduct        593             com.brainysoftware.ejb.ProductHome           com.brainysoftware.ejb.Product           com.brainysoftware.ejb.ProductBean           Bean           com.brainysoftware.ejb.ProductPK< prim-key- class>          false                       dbUrl             java.lang.String             jdbc:mysql:  localhost MyDB< env-entry- value>                                dbUserName             java.lang.String             yena                                 dbPassword             java.lang.String             lang0128934                                Like the deployment descriptor accompanying the session beans in Chapters 28 and 29, you need  to specify the fully qualified names for the remote interface, the home interface, and the entity  bean. In addition, for an entity bean, you also need to tell the EJB container what type of  persistence your entity bean is using. In this case, the   element has the value of  "Bean".   There are also three   elements, each specifying an environment variable. The three  values are obtained by the getConenction method in the entity bean class to connect to the  underlying database.   Packaging Your Entity Bean   Now you are ready to package your entity bean. Do the following:   1.  Compile all the .java class and place the .class files in the com  brainysoftware ejb    directory under your project directory.   2.  Change the directory to your project directory.  3.  Type the following command:   jar cfv product.jar com brainysoftware ejb Product*.* META- INF ejb-jar.xml   This command will create a jar file called product.jar in the project directory. Copy this file into  the deploy directory of JBoss. If JBoss is not running, start JBoss. If JBoss is already running, you  don't need to do anything. JBoss's hot deploy feature will automatically try to deploy any package  file saved into the deploy directory.   Client Application      594      Having a deployed entity bean, you now can write a client application to test your bean. The client  application is given in Listing 30.6. Make sure that your database server is running.   Listing 30.6 The Client Application   import javax.naming.*;   import javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject;   import java.util.Properties;   import java.util.Enumeration;   import com.brainysoftware.ejb.Product;   import com.brainysoftware.ejb.ProductHome;     public class BeanClient {      public static void main String[] args  {         preparing properties for constructing an InitialContext object       Properties properties = new Properties  ;       properties.put Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY,   "org.jnp.interfaces.NamingContextFactory" ;       properties.put Context.PROVIDER_URL, "localhost:1099" ;           try {           Get an initial context         InitialContext jndiContext = new InitialContext properties ;         System.out.println "Got context" ;              Get a reference to the Bean         Object ref  = jndiContext.lookup "BMPProduct" ;         System.out.println "Got reference" ;              Get a reference from this to the Bean's Home interface         ProductHome home =  ProductHome            PortableRemoteObject.narrow  ref, ProductHome.class ;              Create an Interest object from the Home interface         home.create 11, "Franklin Spring Water", "400ml", 2.25 ;         home.create 12, "Franklin Spring Water", "600ml", 3.25 ;         home.create 13, "Choco Bar", "Chocolate Bar 200g", 2.95 ;         home.create 14, "Timtim Biscuit", "Biscuit w. mint flavor,  300g", 9.25 ;         Product product = home.create 15, "Supermie", "Instant Noodle",  1.05 ;         product.remove  ;           Enumeration enum = home.findByName "Franklin Spring Water" ;         while  enum.hasMoreElements    {          product =  Product  enum.nextElement  ;           System.out.println "Id: " + product.getProductId   ;           System.out.println "Product Name: " +  product.getProductName   ;           System.out.println "Description: " +  product.getDescription   ;           System.out.println "Price: " + product.getPrice   ;         }         }       catch Exception e  {        System.out.println e.toString   ;       }       595        }   }   This client application is very similar to the client application used to access the session beans in  Chapters 28 and 29. The application inserts five records by calling the create method of the home  object and removes the last one. It then also calls the findByName method and iterates the details  of each product that has the specified name. Check your database's Products table to make sure  that these records are inserted correctly.       Writing a CMP Entity Bean   Although a BMP entity bean is a great object for representing your data, a CMP entity bean is  even easier to write. In BMP entity beans, you write your own method implementations for the  create and finder methods, as well as for the ejbStore and ejbLoad methods. Additionally, you  need to have a method that returns a java.sql.Connection object for your methods to connect to the  underlying database.   A CMP entity bean relies on the EJB container to do this database-related task. You don't need to  write a getConnection method, you don't need to connect to the database in your create and  remove methods, and you don't need to provide implementation in your ejbStore and ejbLoad  methods. In fact, you don't need to write a single SQL statement!   You don't even have to write the implementation of a finder method declared in the remote  interface. Everythingâwell, almost everythingâis taken care of by the EJB container. As such,  an entity bean with CMP is much easier to write and maintain. There is one drawback, however.  You need to do more configuration in the deployment descriptor and in the configuration file  specific to the application server you are using.   Also note that how your data is persisted depends entirely on the EJB container. The container  might use the default built-in database, or it might use files to persist your entity bean's data. You  should be able to elect how this is done by configuring some settings in the application server.   In JBoss, for example, if you don't specify anything, the open source EJB container will create a  table for you in the default database. You also can use your own database server, however, and  you should consult the JBoss documentation if you choose to do so.   JBoss provides the following three finder methods:             findByPrimaryKey  findAll  findBy    value    You see how these finder methods can be used in the client class that accompanies this entity bean  application.   In addition, you also can define a custom finder method. Again, you should consult the JBoss  documentation.   The following example presents a CMP entity bean that is very similar to the BMP Product entity  bean. This similarity is intentional to show the difference between the two types of entity beans.  All class files are prefixed with CMP, and the primary key class type is java.lang.String.      596      The Remote Interface   The remote interface of the CMPProduct bean is similar to that of the BMP Product bean given in  Listing 30.1 The code for the remote interface is given in Listing 30.7.   Listing 30.7 The Remote Interface  CMPProduct.java    package com.brainysoftware.ejb;     import javax.ejb.EJBObject;   import java.rmi.RemoteException;      * this is the remote interface for Product *    public interface CMPProduct extends EJBObject {    public String getProductId   throws RemoteException;     public double getPrice   throws RemoteException;     public String getProductName   throws RemoteException;     public String getDescription   throws RemoteException;   }   The Home Interface   The home interface defines one create method and three finder methods. The home interface is  given in Listing 30.8.   Listing 30.8 The Home Interface  CMPProductHome.java    package com.brainysoftware.ejb;     import java.rmi.RemoteException;   import javax.ejb.FinderException;   import javax.ejb.CreateException;   import javax.ejb.EJBHome;   import java.util.Collection;   import java.util.Enumeration;     public interface CMPProductHome extends EJBHome {    public CMPProduct create int productId, String productName,       String description, double price        throws RemoteException, CreateException;       public CMPProduct findByPrimaryKey String productId        throws RemoteException, FinderException;       public Enumeration findByProductName String productName        throws RemoteException, FinderException;       public Collection findAll         throws RemoteException, FinderException;   }   The Entity Bean Class   Compared to the entity bean class of the BMP entity bean, the entity bean class for the  CMPProduct is much simpler and shorter. Notice that it does not have implementation to connect  to an underlying database. The entity bean class is given in Listing 30.9.      597      Listing 30.9 The Entity Bean Class  CMPProductBean.java    package com.brainysoftware.ejb;     import java.sql.*;   import java.util.Properties;   import java.util.Enumeration;   import java.util.Vector;   import java.rmi.RemoteException;   import javax.ejb.EntityBean;   import javax.ejb.EntityContext;   import javax.ejb.CreateException;   import javax.ejb.FinderException;   import javax.ejb.ObjectNotFoundException;   import javax.naming.InitialContext;   import javax.naming.Context;   import javax.naming.NamingException;     public class CMPProductBean implements EntityBean {    EntityContext context;       public String productId;     public String productName;     public String description;     public double price;       public String getProductId   {      System.out.println "getProductId" ;       return productId;     }       public String getProductName   {      System.out.println "getProductName" ;       return productName;     }       public String getDescription   {      System.out.println "getDescription" ;       return description;     }       public double getPrice   {      System.out.println "getPrice" ;       return price;     }       public String ejbCreate int productId, String productName,       String description, double price        throws RemoteException, CreateException {      System.out.println "ejbCreate" ;       this.productId = Integer.toString  productId ;       this.productName = productName;       this.description = description;       this.price = price;       return Integer.toString productId ;     }       public void ejbPostCreate int productId, String productName,       String description, double price        throws RemoteException, CreateException {      System.out.println "ejbPostCreate" ;       598                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®         }       public void ejbRemove   throws RemoteException {      System.out.println "ejbRemove" ;     }       public void ejbActivate   {      System.out.println "ejbActivate" ;     }       public void ejbPassivate   {      System.out.println "ejbPassivate" ;     }       public void ejbLoad   {      System.out.println "ejbLoad" ;     }       public void ejbStore   {      System.out.println "ejbStore" ;     }       public void setEntityContext EntityContext context  {      System.out.println "setEntityContext" ;       this.context = context;     }       public void unsetEntityContext   {      System.out.println "unsetEntityContext" ;       context = null;     }   }   The entity bean class has the familiar four business methods: getProductId, getProductName,  getDescription, and getPrice. The only method with substantial content is the ejbCreate method.  This method populates the class fields with the arguments passed to the ejbCreate method.  However, there is no code to connect the database as in the ejbCreate method in the BMP entity  bean, as you see here:   String description, double price      throws RemoteException, CreateException {  System.out.println "ejbCreate" ;   this.productId = Integer.toString  productId ;   this.productName = productName;   this.description = description;   this.price = price;   return Integer.toString productId ;   The Deployment Descriptor   The deployment descriptor is given in Listing 30.10.   Listing 30.10 The Deployment Descriptor  ejb-jar.xml        <!DOCTYPE ejb-jar PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.

This deployment  descriptor, however, has   elements for all fields that need to be persisted. In this  example, those fields are productId, productName, description, and price. The    element also specifies the primary key field.   Note   The value for the   element is Container, not Bean as it is in a BMP  entity bean.   Packaging Your CMP Entity Bean   Now you are ready to package your entity bean. Follow these steps:.   1.  Compile all the .java files and place the .class files in the com brainysoftware ejb    directory under your project directory.   2.  Change the directory to your project directory.  3.  Type the following command:   jar cfv cmpproduct.jar  com brainysoftware ejb CMPProduct*.*META-INF ejb-jar.xml   This command creates a .jar file called cmpproduct.jar in the project directory. Copy this file into  the deploy directory of JBoss. If JBoss is not running, start it. If JBoss is already running, you  don't need to do anything.

Two types of entity  beans are used: bean-managed persistence  BMP  and container-managed persistence  CMP .   Entity beans with BMP provide more flexibility for handling and storing the data in the underlying  database. For BMP entity beans, you need to provide information on how to load the JDBC driver  for the underlying database.   Entity beans with CMP are very easy to write because the EJB container takes care of how the  data is persisted. You don't even have to write a single SQL statement for your entity bean.      602      Chapter 31. EJB Query Language   You learned in Chapter 30, "Entity Beans," that there are two types of entity beans: bean-managed  persistence  BMP  and container-managed persistence  CMP . The examples in that chapter show  how entity beans with CMP can reduce the number of code lines you need. When you use entity  beans with CMP, you don't have to worry about how the entity bean's data is persisted. The  container takes care of this for you.   Although automatic persistence by the container is a good feature of the CMP entity beans, BMP  entity beans are sometimes preferable because they are more flexible in defining complex finder  methods. With BMP entity beans, you can write a complex SQL statement for your finder method  and have it select any set of records you want.   This flexibility is not present in the CMP entity bean because you don't implement your own  finder methods. Instead, you depend on the EJB container's built-in finder methods. In JBoss, you  have three: findByPrimaryKey, findAll, and findBy .   To get around this limitation in CMP entity beans, EJB 2.0 specifies the Enterprise JavaBeans  Query Language  EJB QL , a language similar to Structured Query Language  SQL  that bean  developers can use to select data for finder methods of CMP entity beans. For performance  optimization, the EJB QL can be compiled to a target language of the database or other persistent  store, just as you can create a stored procedure that encapsulates your SQL statement to speed up  the execution of your SQL statement.   EJB QL queries can be used in two different ways:      For selecting entity objects as defined in finder methods in the home interface     For selecting entity objects or other values derived from an entity bean's abstract schema   type   The EJB QL statements for your finder or select methods are specified in the deployment  descriptor, under the   element. For instance, the following deployment descriptor specifies  a finder method named findByDescription, which accepts one parameter of type java.lang.String:       <!DOCTYPE ejb-jar PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Enterprise  JavaBeans 2.0  EN"   "http:  java.sun.com dtd ejb-jar_2_0.dtd">                           .         .         .                                    findByDescription                                 java.lang.String                                                    <![CDATA[SELECT OBJECT product  FROM CMPProduct AS product  WHERE   Description=?1]]>                   603                                        EJB QL Syntax   The name of the find method is specified in the   element and the parameters are  specified in the   elements. The EJB-QL statement itself is given in the    element.   This chapter focuses on EJB QL and shows how it can benefit you as a CMP-entity bean  developer. The next section starts by presenting the syntax of the EJB QL.   Understanding the syntax of the EJB QL is key to creating an efficient finder method. This section  describes the most important parts of this query language.   An EJB QL query must take the following form:   select_clause from_clause [where_clause]   In this query, the where_clause is optional. Each clause is explained in the subsections that follow.   The SELECT Clause   The SELECT clause specifies the output of the EJB QL query. It can contain one of the following:      A single range variable ranging over the abstract schema type of an entity bean     A single valued path expression   The SELECT clause in a finder method contains either a single range variable ranging over the  abstract schema type of the entity bean for which the finder method is defined, or a cmr-field  indicated by a single valued path expression that evaluates to the abstract schema type of the entity  bean for which the finder method is defined.   In contrast, the SELECT clause of the query for a select method can return the abstract schema  types of other entity beans or the values of cmp-fields.   The syntax of the SELECT clause is as follows:   SELECT [DISTINCT] {single_valued_path_expression   OBJECT identification_variable }   When the DISTINCT keyword is present in a SELECT clause, duplicate values are eliminated  from the EJB QL query result.   When the DISTINCT keyword is not present in a SELECT clause, but the query is specified for a  method whose result type is java.util.Set, all duplicate values also are eliminated from the query  result.      604   As an example, here is a simple EJB QL statement that will find all distinct products:      SELECT DISTINCT OBJECT p    FROM Product AS p   The FROM Clause   The FROM clause defines the domain of the query by declaring identification variables. The  domain of the query can be constrained by path expressions. The FROM clause can contain  multiple identification variables separated by a comma. It has the following syntax:   FROM identification_variable_declaration  [,identification_variable_declaration]*   In this clause, the asterisk denotes that the value in the bracket it follows can be repeated zero or  more times. Further, the identification_variable_declaration is defined as follows:   identification_variable_declaration::= collection_member_declaration   range_variable_declaration       collection_member_declaration::= IN   collection_valued_path_expression  [AS] identifier     range_variable_declaration::= abstract_schema_name [AS] identifier   An identifier is a case-insensitive sequence of characters of any length. The first character of an  identifier must be a valid Java identifier start character, and all other characters must be legal Java  identifier part characters. In addition, an identifier must not be one of the following: SELECT,  FROM, WHERE, DISTINCT, OBJECT, NULL, TRUE, FALSE, NOT, AND, OR, BETWEEN,  LIKE, IN, AS, UNKNOWN, EMPTY, MEMBER, OF, and IS.   An identification variable acts as an identifier in the FROM clause. It is declared using the special  operators INâand optionally, AS. An identification variable is also case-insensitive and must not  be a reserved identifier. In addition, it must not have the same name as an abstract-schema-name  or ejb-name.   An identification variable declaration is either a range variable declaration or a collection member  declaration. If an identification variable declaration is a range variable declaration, it ranges over  the abstract schema type of an entity bean. The syntax for declaring an identification variable as a  range variable is similar to that of SQL; optionally, it uses the AS operator.   In the case where an identification variable declaration is a collection member declaration, the  identification variable declared by the collection member declaration ranges over values of a  collection obtained by navigation using a path expression. An identification variable of a  collection member declaration is declared using the IN operator.   A path expression is an identification variable that is followed by the navigation operator  .  and a  cmp-field or cmr-field.   The following is the syntax for single valued path expressions:   single_valued_path::= {single_valued_navigation  identification  variable}.cmp_field    single_valued_navigation       605      single_valued_navigation::=  identification_variable.[single_valued_cmr_field.]*   single_valued_cmr_field   The following is the syntax for collection valued path expressions:   collection_valued_path_expression::= identification_variable.   [single_valued_cmr_field.]*collection_valued_cmr_field   single_valued_cmr_ field is designated by a cmr-field in a one-to-one or many-to-one relationship.  The type of the expression is the abstract schema type of the related entity bean. The type of  collection_valued_cmr_ field is a collection of values of the abstract schema type of the related  entity bean.   Consider the following EJB QL statement that incorporates a FROM clause to find all orders for  products with category 'book':   The WHERE clause of an EJB QL query determines the selection of data. It has the following  syntax:   SELECT DISTINCT OBJECT o    FROM Order o, IN o.lineItems  l   WHERE l.product.category = 'book'   The WHERE Clause   WHERE conditional_expression   A conditional expression can contain the following elements:   Identification variable      Literal        Path expression  Input parameters        Conditional expression composition     Operators and operator precedence     Between expressions        Like expressions     Null comparison expressions     Empty collection comparison expressions     Collection member expressions     Functional expressions   In expressions   Each of these is explained in the following subsections.   Literal   A literal can be a string literal, an exact numeric literal, an approximate numeric literal, or a  boolean literal. A string literal appears inside a pair of single quotation marks, such as 'java'. If a  string literal contains a single quote character, the character must be escaped using another single  quote character. Thus, a string literal containing O'Connor is represented as 'O"Connor'.   An exact numeric literal is a numeric value without a decimal point in the range specified by the  Java long. Examples include 123, +80, and -99.      606      An approximate numeric literal is a numeric value in the range specified by the Java float and is  represented in scientific notation or a numeric value with a decimal point. Examples include 9E2,  -9E2, +6.6, and -98.98.   A boolean literal is either TRUE or FALSE.   Identification Variable   An identification variable is defined in the earlier section, "The FROM Clause." Any identification  that appears in the WHERE clause must be declared in the FROM clause.   Path Expression   Path expression also is defined in the section, "The FROM Clause." It is illegal to use a  collection_valued_path_expression within a WHERE clause as part of a conditional expression,  except in an empty_collection_comparison_expression or collection_member_expression.   Input Parameters   Input parameters obey the following rules:      An input parameter is designated by the question mark  ?  prefix followed by an integer,   such as ?1.  Input parameters are numbered starting from 1.         The number of distinct input parameters in an EJB QL query must not be greater than the   number of input parameters for the finder or select method.  Input parameters must appear only in conditional expressions involving single valued  path expressions.      An input parameter evaluates to the type of the corresponding parameter defined in the   signature of the finder or select method associated with the query.  If the input parameter to the finder or select method corresponds to an EJBObject or  EJBLocalObject, the container maps the input parameter to the appropriate abstract  schema type value.           The following EJB QL statement is an example of a query that uses an input parameter. The  statement finds all products that are cheaper than the value passed as the parameter:   SELECT DISTINCT OBJECT o    FROM Product o   WHERE o.price < ?1   Conditional Expression Composition   A conditional expression contains other conditional expressions, comparison operations, logical  operations, and path expressions that evaluate to boolean values and boolean literals.   Conditional expressions have the following syntax::   conditional_expression::= conditional_term  conditional_expression  OR   conditional_term     conditional_term::= conditional_factor  conditional_term AND   conditional_factor     conditional_factor::= [NOT] conditional_test       607        conditional_primary::= simple_cond_expression   conditional_expression     simple_cond_expression::= comparison_expression  between_expression     like_expression  in_expression  null_comparison_expression    empty_collection_comparison_expression  collection_member_expression   Operators and Operator Precedence   In a WHERE clause, operators can be one of the following. These operators are ordered in  decreasing precedence:      Navigation operator  .      Arithmetic operators: unary, multiplication and division  *,  , addition and subtraction    +,-       Comparison operators: =, >, >=,       Logical operators: NOT, AND, OR   Between Expressions   The following is the syntax for the use of the comparison operator [NOT] BETWEEN in a  conditional expression:   arithmetic_expression [NOT] BETWEEN arithmetic-expr AND arithmetic- expr   In Expressions   Like Expressions   The following is the syntax for the use of the comparison operator [NOT] IN in a conditional  expression:   single_valued_path_expression [NOT] IN  string-literal [, string- literal]*     The following is the syntax for the use of the comparison operator [NOT] LIKE in a conditional  expression:   single_valued_path_expression [NOT] LIKE pattern-value [ESCAPE  escape-characater]   Null Comparison Expressions   The following is the syntax for the use of the comparison operator IS NULL in a conditional  expression:   single_valued_path_expression IS [NOT] NULL   Empty Collection Comparison Expressions   The following is the syntax for the use of the comparison operator IS EMPTY in an  empty_collection_comparison_expression:      608                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       collection_valued_path_expression IS [NOT] EMPTY   Collection Member Expressions   The following is the syntax for the use of the comparison operator MEMBER OF in a  collection_member_expression:   single_valued_path_expression [NOT] MEMBER [OF]   collection_valued_path_expression   Functional Expressions   The following are built-in functions in EJB QL:      String functions:   CONCAT String, String  returns a String   SUBSTRING String, start, length  returns a String   LOCATE String, String [, start]  returns an int   LENGTH String  returns an int      Arithmetic functions:   ABS number  returns an int, a float or a double   SQRT double  returns a double       EJB QL BNF   The BNF notation of an EJB QL is given as follows:   EJB QL ::= select_clause from_clause [where_clause]   from_clause ::=FROM identification_variable_declaration   [, identification_variable_declaration]*   identification_variable_declaration ::= collection_member_declaration     range_variable_declaration   collection_member_declaration ::=IN   collection_valued_path_expression  [AS ] identifier   range_variable_declaration ::= abstract_schema_name [AS ] identifier   single_valued_path_expression ::=   {single_valued_navigation  identification_variable}.cmp_field    single_valued_navigation   single_valued_navigation ::=   identification_variable.[single_valued_cmr_field.]*  single_valued_cmr_field   collection_valued_path_expression ::=   identification_variable.[single_valued_cmr_field.]*collection_valued_ cmr_field       609      select_clause ::=SELECT [DISTINCT ] {single_valued_path_expression    OBJECT  identification_variable }   where_clause ::=WHERE conditional_expression   conditional_expression ::= conditional_term   conditional_expressionOR conditional_term   conditional_term ::= conditional_factor  conditional_termAND  conditional_factor   conditional_factor ::= [NOT ] conditional_test   conditional_test :: = conditional_primary   conditional_primary ::= simple_cond_expression    conditional_expression    simple_cond_expression ::= comparison_expression  between_expression   like_expression    in_expression  null_comparison_expression    empty_collection_comparison_expression    collection_member_expression   between_expression ::=   arithmetic_expression [NOT ] BETWEEN   arithmetic_expressionAND arithmetic_expression   in_expression ::=   single_valued_path_expression [NOT ] IN  string_literal [,  string_literal]*       like_expression ::=   single_valued_path_expression [NOT ]LIKE pattern_value [ESCAPE  escape-character]   null_comparison_expression ::= single_valued_path_expressionIS [NOT ]  NULL   empty_collection_comparison_expression ::=   collection_valued_path_expressionIS [NOT] EMPTY   collection_member_expression ::=   single_valued_path_expression [NOT ] MEMBER [OF ]   collection_valued_path_expression   comparison_expression ::=   string_value { = } string_expression    boolean_value { = } boolean_expression}    datetime_value { =     >  < } datetime_expression    entity_bean_value { =    } entity_bean_expression    arithmetic_value comparison_operator single_value_designator   arithmetic_value ::= single_valued_path_expression   functions_returning_numerics   single_value_designator ::= scalar_expression   comparison_operator ::=   =  >  >=      scalar_expression ::= arithmetic_expression   arithmetic_expression ::= arithmetic_term  arithmetic_expression { +   -

Java Message Service   In Chapters 29 and 30, you learned about the first two types of Enterprise JavaBeans  EJB â session beans and entity beans. The last type, which you have yet to see, is the message-driven  bean, which is a new addition to the EJB 2.0 specification. To understand message-driven beans,  you first need a solid background in the Java Message Service   JMS , which is the topic of this  chapter. The message-driven bean itself is discussed in Chapter 33, "Message-Driven Beans." If  you've already been working with JMS, feel free to skip this chapter.   This chapter starts by introducing you to messaging and the JMS API. This chapter then develops  several examples that use JMS to send and receive messages.       Introduction to Messaging   A messaging service is a service that provides communication between applications or between  software components. Any application or software component that uses a messaging service is  called a messaging client. In a typical messaging service, a messaging client can send and receive  messages.   A chat application is a good analogy for illustrating a messaging service. Normally, the chat server  provides two methods of communication for its users. These are as follows:      A user can send a chat message that is broadcast to all other chat users     A user can send a private message to another user that is not visible to other chat users   As you learn later in this chapter, JMS also provides these two similar services.   A messaging service is more sophisticated than a chat application, however. In a chat application,  in order to exchange messages, the sender and the receiver s  must be connected at the same time.  In a messaging service, the sender can send a message without the receiver having to be connected  at the same moment. The sender sends a message to a destination, and then the receiver collects it  from there.   JMS also decoupled its clients. The sender does not need to know anything about the receiver, and  vice versa.       The JMS API   Sun joined forces with some partner companies to design the JMS API to enable Java applications  to create, send, receive, and read messages, as well as communicate with other messaging  implementations. The original version of JMS was released in August 1998, and it was used  mainly to allow Java applications to access existing messaging-oriented middleware  MOM   systems, such as IBM's MQSeries. Currently, the most recent version of the JMS API is 1.0.2,  which is downloadable from http:  java.sun.com products jms docs.html.      612      Java applications that use JMS are called JMS clients, and the messaging system that handles the  routing and delivery of messages is called the JMS provider. A JMS client that sends a message is  called a producer, and a JMS client that receives a message is called a consumer. A single JMS  client can be both a producer and a consumer. A JMS application consists of many JMS clients  and one or more JMS providers.   The following two nice features are inherent with JMS:           asynchronous: A JMS client does not have to request messages to receive them. The  JMS provider delivers messages to the client as the messages arrive.  reliable: A JMS system can ensure that a message is delivered only once.   JMS is normally preferred to a tightly coupled messaging system in the following conditions:      The clients need to be de-coupled from each other     Message exchange can occur even though not all clients are up and running at the same   time      The business model requires components to send messages to one another and continue to   operate without receiving an immediate response     The JMS API Messaging Domains   Messaging domains are models for messaging. The JMS API provides the following two  messaging domains: publish subscribe and point-to-point.   Publish Subscribe  pub sub    In this model, a client sends a message to a topic and the message is received by any interesting  clients that subscribes to that topic. This is a one-to-many model where the sender is also called  the publisher and the receiver s  is called the subscriber s . The act of sending a message is also  called publish. Topics send the messages straight to all subscribers and don't keep the messages. A  client can consume messages only after the client subscribes to a topic, and the subscriber must  continue to be active to consume published messages. This restriction is somewhat relaxed in JMS,  however, by enabling a client to create durable subscriptions in which the client can receive  messages sent while the client is not active.   Compare the pub sub model with a radio station that broadcasts news all the time. The news can  be received by any radio that is tuned to the radio station's frequency and modulation. To receive a  particular piece of news, a radio must be turned on at the time the news item is broadcast.   Point-to-Point  PTP    In this model, a client sends a message that is received only by one client. The sender sends a  message to a queue and the receiver extracts this message from the queue at any convenient time  the receiver connects to the system. A queue retains all messages it receives until the messages are  consumed or until the messages expire.   The PTP model is similar to the U.S. Postal Service in which the addressee has a P.O. Box at a  particular post office. The sender sends a letter and the addressee will pick it up in the post office.  The letter can be received by only one recipient.         613   The most important objects in the JMS object model are represented by the following interfaces in  the javax.jms package:      The JMS Object Model      ConnectionFactory     Destination     Connection     Session     MessageProducer     MessageConsumer     Message   These objects are discussed in the following sections.   ConnectionFactory   A ConnectionFactory object is used to create a connection with a JMS provider. This object  supports concurrent use and contains connection configuration parameters that have been defined  by an administrator. In the javax.jms package, the ConnectionFactory object is modeled by the  ConnectionFactory interface, whose signature is as follows:   public interface ConnectionFactory   The ConnectionFactory interface does not define any method and has two direct subinterfaces:  TopicConnectionFactory and QueueConnectionFactory. The QueueConnectionFactory interface is  used to create a connection with a point-to-point JMS provider, and the TopicConnectionFactory  interface is used to create a connection with a pub sub JMS provider.   You usually perform a JNDI lookup of the connection factory in a JMS client program. For  example, to get a connection to a point-to-point JMS provider, you would use the following code:   Context context = new InitialContext  ;   QueueConnectionFactory queueConnectionFactory =      QueueConnectionFactory  context.lookup "QueueConnectionFactory" ;   And, to get a connection to a pub sub JMS provider, you use the following code:   Context context = new InitialContext  ;   TopicConnectionFactory topicConnectionFactory =      TopicConnectionFactory  context.lookup "TopicConnectionFactory" ;   You then can use the QueueConnectionFactory interface's createQueueConnection method to  obtain a QueueConnection object or the TopicConnectionFactory interface's  createTopicConnection method to obtain a TopicConnection object.   A connection factory is a JMS administered object.   A JMS administered object is an object that contains configuration information created by  an administrator to be used by JMS clients.   Note   Destination      614      A Destination object encapsulates a provider-specific address. A Destination object supports  concurrent use and in the javax.jms package is represented by the Destination interface whose  signature is as follows:   public interface Destination   The Destination interface does not have any method.   In the pub sub domain, a destination is a topic. In the PTP domain, a destination is a queue. To  accommodate this, the Destination interface has two direct subinterfaces: Topic and Queue.   Like the ConnectionFactory object, you get a Destination object by performing a JNDI lookup.  Depending on the domain you use, you will need either a Topic object or a Queue object. Here is  the code to obtain a Queue in the PTP domain:   Context context = new InitialContext  ;   QueueConnectionFactory queueConnectionFactory =      QueueConnectionFactory  context.lookup "QueueConnectionFactory" ;   Queue queue =  Queue  context.lookup queueName ;   And, here is how you obtain a Topic object in the pub sub domain:   Context context = new InitialContext  ;   TopicConnectionFactory topicConnectionFactory =      TopicConnectionFactory  context.lookup "TopicConnectionFactory" ;   Topic topic =  Topic  context.lookup topicName ;   Note   Connections   A Destination object is a JMS-administered object.   A Connection object represents a JMS client's active connection to a JMS provider. Typically, it is  a TCP IP socket between a JMS client and a JMS provider. Connection objects support concurrent  use and are represented by the javax.jms.Connection interface. This Connection interface has the  following signature:   public interface Connection   A Connection object is a relatively heavyweight object because creating a Connection object  involves setting up authentication and communication.   In JMS, there are two types of connection: QueueConnection and TopicConnection. A  QueueConnection object is used to obtain a connection to a PTP domain, and a TopicConnection  is used to obtain a connection to a pub sub domain. These two types of connections are  represented by objects that implement the QueueConnection interface and the TopicConnection  interface, respectively. Both QueueConnection and TopicConnection are direct subinterfaces of  the Connection interface and have a method to create the corresponding Session object suitable for  its domain.   When first created, a connection is in stopped mode, meaning that no messages are being  delivered. You usually leave the connection in stopped mode until setup is complete. The client  can then call the connection object's start method.      615      In a PTP domain, you obtain a QueueConnection object by calling the createQueueConnection  method of the QueueConnectionFactory object, as shown in the following code:   QueueConnection queueConnection =     queueConnectionFactory.createQueueConnection  ;   In a pub sub domain, you obtain a TopicConnection object by calling the createTopicConnection  method of the TopicConnectionFactory object, as demonstrated in the following code:   TopicConnection topicConnection =   topicConnectionFactory.createTopicConnection  ;   Once you get a connection object, you can call the start method of the Connection interface to  enable your JMS application to consume messages. Do not forget to release resources by closing a  connection when it's no longer in use. You close a connection by calling the close method of the  Connection interface.   Session   A Session object is a single-threaded context for producing and consuming messages. A Session  object is represented by the Session interface, which uses the following signature:   public interface Session extends java.lang.Runnable   The Session interface has two direct subinterfaces: TopicSession and QueueSession. These  represent a session in a pub sub domain and in a PTP domain, respectively.   To create a TopicSession object, you call the createTopicSession method of the TopicConnection  interface. To construct a QueueSession object, you use the CreateQueueSession method of the  QueueConnection interface. The signatures of these methods are as follows:   public TopicSession createTopicSession boolean transacted, int   acknowledgeMode  throws JMSException     public QueueSession createQueueSession boolean transacted, int   acknowledgeMode  throws JMSException   The createTopicSession and the createQueueSession methods have the following common  parameters:          transacted. This parameter indicates whether the session is transacted.  acknowledgeMode. This parameter indicates whether the consumer or the client will  acknowledge messages it receives. Its value can be one of the three fields of the Session  interface.      AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE. The session automatically acknowledges a client's receipt  of a message either when the session has successfully returned from a call to receive or  when the message listener the session has called to process the message successfully  returns.      CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE. The client acknowledges a consumed message by calling   the message's acknowledge method.      DUPS_OK_ACKNOWLEDGE. This acknowledgment mode instructs the session to   lazily acknowledge the delivery of messages.   The acknowledgeMode parameter is ignored if the session is transacted.      616      The following code creates an untransacted TopicSession object with AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE  acknowledge mode:   TopicSession topicSession =   topicConnection.createTopicSession false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE ;   And the following code constructs an untransacted QueueSession object with   CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE acknowledge mode:   QueueSession queusSession = queueConnection.createQueueSession  false,   Session.CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE ;   MessageProducer   A MessageProducer object is used by a JMS client to send messages to a destination. In javax.jms  package, this object is represented by the MessageProducer interface, which has the following  signature:   public interface MessageProducer   The MessageProducer interface has two direct subinterfaces:      QueueSender. You use this interface in the PTP domain.     TopicPublisher. You use this interface in the pub sub domain.   A MessageProducer object is created by passing a Destination object to its message-producer  method of the corresponding session object. For example, you create a QueueSender object by  calling the createSender method of the QueueSession interface, passing a Queue. Here is a code  snippet that creates a QueueSender object:   Context context = new InitialContext  ;   QueueConnectionFactory queueConnectionFactory =   QueueConnectionFactory      context.lookup "QueueConnectionFactory" ;   Queue queue =  Queue  context.lookup queueName ;     QueueConnection queueConnection =      queueConnectionFactory.createQueueConnection  ;   QueueSession queueSession =  queueConnection.createQueueSession false,     Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE ;   QueueSender queueSender = queueSession.createSender queue ;   As another example of creating a MessageProducer object, the following code creates a  TopicPublisher object:   Context context = new InitialContext  ;   TopicConnectionFactory topicConnectionFactory =   TopicConnectionFactory      context.lookup "TopicConnectionFactory" ;   Topic topic =  Topic  context.lookup topicName ;     TopicConnection topicConnection =      topicConnectionFactory.createTopicConnection  ;   TopicSession topicSession =  topicConnection.createTopicSession false,     Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE ;   TopicPublisher topicPublisher = topicSession.createPublisher topic ;      617      MessageConsumer   A MessageConsumer object is used by a JMS client to receive message from a destination. In  javax.jms package, this object is represented by the MessageConsumer interface, which has the  following signature:   public interface MessageConsumer   The MessageConsumer interface has two direct subinterfaces:      QueueReceiver. You use this interface in the PTP domain.     TopicSubscriber. You use this interface in the pub sub domain.   A MessageConsumer object is created by passing a Destination object to its message-consumer  method of the corresponding session object. For example, you create a QueueReceiver object by  calling the createReceiver method of the QueueSession interface, passing a Queue, as you see in  the following code:   Context context = new InitialContext  ;   QueueConnectionFactory queueConnectionFactory =   QueueConnectionFactory      context.lookup "QueueConnectionFactory" ;   Queue queue =  Queue  context.lookup queueName ;     QueueConnection queueConnection =      queueConnectionFactory.createQueueConnection  ;   QueueSession queueSession =  queueConnection.createQueueSession false,     Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE ;   QueueReceiver queueReceiver = queueSession.createReceiver queue ;   To create a TopicSubscriber object, you call the createSubscriber method of the TopicSession  interface, passing a Topic. The following code demonstrates how you can create a  TopicSubscriber object:   Context context = new InitialContext  ;   TopicConnectionFactory topicConnectionFactory =   TopicConnectionFactory      context.lookup "TopicConnectionFactory" ;   Topic topic =  Topic  context.lookup topicName ;     TopicConnection topicConnection =      topicConnectionFactory.createTopicConnection  ;   TopicSession topicSession =  topicConnection.createTopicSession false,     Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE ;   TopicSubscriber topicSubscriber =  topicSession.createSubscriber topic ;   Message   There are many types of messages in JMS:      TextMessage. A message containing a string.     MapMessage. A message containing name value pairs. Each name is a String object and   each value is a Java primitive type.      BytesMessage. A message containing a stream of uninterpreted bytes.     StreamMessage. A message containing a stream of Java primitive values.      618                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®          ObjectMessage. A message containing a serializable object.   All these messages are represented by interfaces that are derived from the javax.jms.Message  interface. The Message interface defines the message header and the acknowledge method for all  messages.   JMS messages are composed of the following parts:      Header. All messages support the same set of header fields. Header fields contain values   used by both clients and providers to identify and route messages.      Properties. Each message contains a built-in facility for supporting application-defined   property values. Properties provide an efficient mechanism for supporting application- defined message filtering.      Body. The JMS API defines several types of message body, which determines the type of   messageâas mentioned previously.   To send a message, you first must create a Message object by calling one of the create message  methods of the Session interface. You can create any type of message by invoking one of the  following methods of the Session interface: createBytesMessage, createMapMessage,  createObjectMessage, createStreamMessage, and createTextMessage. For example, the following  code creates a TextMessage object from a QueueSession object, sets the text in it, and sends it to a  queue:   TextMessage message = queueSession.createTextMessage  ;   message.setText "This is a TextMessage" ;   queueSender.send message ;   To receive a message, you use the receive method of the MessageConsumer interface, as  illustrated in the following code snippet:   Message message = queueReceiver.receive  ;   If necessary, you can use instanceof to query the type of message returned, as you see here:   if  message instanceof ObjectMessage  {    ObjectMessage objectMessage =  ObjectMessage message;   }      Writing JMS Clients   Based on what you learned in the previous sections, you can now write two JMS client  applications. The first application, given in Listing 32.1, provides the code to send a message to a  queue called MyQueue. The code in Listing 32.2 receives the message and displays it on the  Console. You should run the first client application before running the second.   Listing 32.1 Message Sender JMS Client Application   package com.brainysoftware.ejb;     import javax.jms.*;   import javax.naming.*;     public class MessageSender {      619          public static void main String[] args  {      QueueConnection queueConnection = null;         try {        Context context = new InitialContext  ;         QueueConnectionFactory queueConnectionFactory =            QueueConnectionFactory   context.lookup "QueueConnectionFactory" ;         String queueName = "MyQueue";         Queue queue =  Queue  context.lookup queueName ;         queueConnection =         queueConnectionFactory.createQueueConnection  ;         QueueSession queueSession =           queueConnection.createQueueSession false,  Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE ;         QueueSender queueSender = queueSession.createSender queue ;         TextMessage message = queueSession.createTextMessage  ;         message.setText "This is a TextMessage" ;         queueSender.send message ;         System.out.println "Message sent." ;       }       catch  NamingException e  {        System.out.println "Naming Exception" ;       }       catch  JMSException e  {        System.out.println "JMS Exception" ;       }       finally {        if  queueConnection != null  {          try {            queueConnection.close  ;           }           catch  JMSException e  {}         }       }     }   }   The code in Listing 32.1 starts by performing a JNDI lookup to obtain a QueueConnectionFactory,  as you see here:   Context context = new InitialContext  ;   QueueConnectionFactory queueConnectionFactory =      QueueConnectionFactory  context.lookup "QueueConnectionFactory" ;   Having a QueueConnectionFactory object, you then can obtain a Queue object by performing  another JNDI lookup, as follows:   String queueName = "MyQueue";   Queue queue =  Queue  context.lookup queueName ;   From the QueueConnectionFactory object, you then use the createQueueConnection method to  create a QueueConnection object:   queueConnection =   queueConnectionFactory.createQueueConnection  ;      620      The QueueConnection object created in the previous line enables you to create a QueueSession  object. You do this by invoking the createQueueSession method, as shown here:   QueueSession queueSession =     queueConnection.createQueueSession false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE ;   Once you have the QueueSession object, you create a QueueSender object by calling the  createSender method of the QueueSession object, passing the Queue object you obtain from the  JNDI lookup:   QueueSender queueSender = queueSession.createSender queue ;   Now, you are ready to send a message. The code in Listing 32.2 composes a TextMessage object  called message from the createTextMessage method of the QueueSession object, sets its text, and  calls the send method of the QueueSender object to send the message, using this code:   TextMessage message = queueSession.createTextMessage  ;   message.setText "This is a TextMessage" ;   queueSender.send message ;   Listing 32.2 Message Receiver JMS Client Application   package com.brainysoftware.ejb;     import javax.jms.*;   import javax.naming.*;   public class MessageReceiver {    public static void main String[] args  {      QueueConnection queueConnection = null;       try {        Context context = new InitialContext  ;         QueueConnectionFactory queueConnectionFactory =            QueueConnectionFactory   context.lookup "QueueConnectionFactory" ;         String queueName = "MyQueue";         Queue queue =  Queue  context.lookup queueName ;         queueConnection =           queueConnectionFactory.createQueueConnection  ;         QueueSession queueSession =  queueConnection.createQueueSession false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE ;         QueueReceiver queueReceiver =  queueSession.createReceiver queue ;         queueConnection.start  ;         Message message = queueReceiver.receive 1 ;         if  message != null  {          if  message instanceof TextMessage  {            TextMessage textMessage =  TextMessage  message;             System.out.println textMessage.getText   ;           }         }       }       catch  NamingException e  {        System.out.println "Naming Exception" ;       }       catch  JMSException e  {        System.out.println "JMS Exception" ;       }       finally {        if  queueConnection != null  {      621              try {            queueConnection.close  ;           }           catch  JMSException e  {}         }       }     }   }   The code in Listing 32.2 is used to receive a message from the JMS provider. Like the code in  Listing 32.1, you first perform two JNDI lookups, first to obtain a QueueConnectionFactory object,  and then to obtain a Queue object. The following is the code to do that:   Context context = new InitialContext  ;         QueueConnectionFactory queueConnectionFactory =            QueueConnectionFactory   context.lookup "QueueConnectionFactory" ;         String queueName = "MyQueue";         Queue queue =  Queue  context.lookup queueName ;   Using the QueueConnectionFactory object from the first JNDI lookup, you call its  createQueueConnection method to create a QueueConnection object:   queueConnection =     queueConnectionFactory.createQueueConnection  ;   Using the resulting QueueConnection object, you obtain a QueueSession object by invoking the  createQueueSession method of the QueueConnection object, as follows:   QueueSession queueSession = queueConnection.createQueueSession false,   Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE ;   To receive a message from a queue, you need a QueueReceiver object. This is constructed from  the createReceiver method of the QueueSession object, passing the Queue object obtained from  the second JNDI lookup, as you see here:   QueueReceiver queueReceiver = queueSession.createReceiver queue ;   With the QueueReceiver object, you can call its receive method to obtain a message with the  following code:   Message message = queueReceiver.receive 1 ;   Next, you make sure that the message is not null and that the message is a TextMessage object. If  it is, display the text of the TextMessage object by calling its getText method, as shown here:   if  message != null  {    if  message instanceof TextMessage  {      TextMessage textMessage =  TextMessage  message;       System.out.println textMessage.getText   ;     }   }      Summary      622      In this chapter, you have learned the basics of JMS, including the JMS architecture and object  model. You also saw how two client applications were developed. You are now ready to move to  the next chapter to write your first message-driven beans.      623      Chapter 33. Message-Driven Beans   In Chapter 32, "Java Message Service," you learned about the messaging service and the Java  Message Service   JMS . This provides the basic knowledge for working with the third type of  Enterprise JavaBeans  EJB : message-driven beans  MDB . Message-driven beans are a new type  of bean added to the EJB 2.0 specification. The MDB model is designed to enable an enterprise  bean to be asynchronously invoked to handle the processing of incoming JMS messages. With the  other two types of beans, you can send and receive messages only synchronously, not  asynchronously.   This chapter begins with a definition of message-driven beans and gives you a close look at the  object model. It then continues with an example of a message-driven bean and provides  instruction on how to deploy it in JBoss.   Note   If you have not previously worked with JMS, you should read Chapter 32 before you read  this chapter.       What Is a Message-Driven Bean?   To the client  and in relation to the messaging service , a message-driven bean is an asynchronous  message consumer. Looking at its behavior, however, a message-driven bean is similar to the  stateless session bean in that a message-driven bean has no conversational state. A message-driven  bean is created and controlled by the EJB container. Unlike session beans and entity beans,  however, message-driven beans do not have a home or remote interface. Client applications access  a message-driven bean through JMS by sending messages to the JMS destination.     The Application Programming Interface   A message-driven bean class must be a public class and must implement the following two  interfaces:          javax.ejb.MessageDrivenBean  javax.jms.MessageListener   In addition to the two interfaces, you need to know about the MessageDrivenContext interface that  is provided by the EJB container for the message-driven bean instance. The following subsections  discuss the javax.ejb.MessageDrivenBean interface and the javax.MessageDrivenContext  interface. Because the javax.jms.MessageListener is discussed in Chapter 32, it is not repeated  here.   The javax.ejb.MessageDrivenBean Interface   The javax.ejb.MessageDrivenBean has the following signature:   public interface MessageDrivenBean extends EnterpriseBean      624      It defines two methods: setMessageDrivenContext and ejbRemove. The signatures of both  methods are as follows:   public void setMessageDrivenContext MessageDrivenContext context   throws EJBException     public void ejbRemove   throws EJBException   The setMessageDrivenContext sets the associated message-driven context, and the ejbRemove  method is invoked by the EJB container before the container ends the life of the message-driven  bean object.   The MessageDrivenContext interface is discussed next.   The javax.ejb.MessageDrivenContext Interface   The MessageDrivenContext interface provides access to the runtime message-driven context that  the container provides for a message-driven enterprise bean instance. The container passes the  MessageDrivenContext interface to an instance after the instance has been created. The message- driven context remains associated with the instance for the lifetime of the instance.   The MessageDrivenContext is derived from the EJBContext interface and has the following  signature:   public interface MessageDrivenContext extends EJBContext   The MessageDrivenContext interface has the following methods:                      getRollbackOnly. Tests whether the transaction has been marked for rollback only. This  method can be called only by a message-driven bean with container-managed transaction  demarcation.  getUserTransaction. Obtains the transaction demarcation interface. Only enterprise  beans with bean-managed transactions can use the UserTransaction interface.  isCallerInRole. Tests whether the caller has a given security role.  setRollbackOnly. Marks the transaction for rollback only. This method can be called  only by a message-driven bean with container-managed transaction demarcation.  getCallerPrincipal, getEJBHome, getEJBLocalHome. These methods are inherited  from the EJBContext interface and must not be called by an instance of a message-driven  bean.   Accessing a Message-Driven Bean   A client application that wants to access a message-driven bean does so by retrieving a  javax.jms.Queue object from a JNDI lookup. The following code illustrates how a reference to a  queue called MyQueue can be obtained:   Context context = new InitialContext  ;   Queue queue =  Queue  context.lookup "java:com env jms MyQueue" ;      Writing a Message-Driven Bean      625      The following example  in Listing 33.1  is a message-driven bean called MyMDB. It is a simple  message-driven bean that listens to a queue and upon receiving a message, retrieves the message  and sends a different TextMessage object to the queue. The example consists of five parts:      Specifying the message-driven bean class     Creating the deployment descriptor     Configuring JBoss to deploy the message-driven bean     Packaging the bean     Writing the client application   These five parts are discussed in the following sections.   The Message-Driven Bean Class   Unlike session beans and entity beans, a message-driven bean has no home or remote interfaces.  The only Java class that you need to write for the message-driven bean is the bean class itself. The  code for the MyMDB message-driven bean is given in Listing 33.1.   Listing 33.1 MyMDB Message-Driven Bean   package com.brainysoftware.ejb;       import javax.ejb.MessageDrivenBean;   import javax.ejb.MessageDrivenContext;   import javax.ejb.EJBException;   import javax.jms.JMSException;   import javax.jms.Message;   import javax.jms.MessageListener;   import javax.jms.Queue;   import javax.jms.QueueConnection;   import javax.jms.QueueConnectionFactory;   import javax.jms.QueueSender;   import javax.jms.QueueSession;   import javax.jms.TextMessage;   import javax.naming.InitialContext;   import javax.naming.NamingException;       public class MyMDB implements MessageDrivenBean, MessageListener {    MessageDrivenContext context = null;     QueueConnection connection;     QueueSession session;       public MyMDB   {      System.out.println "Constructing MyMDB" ;     }       public void setMessageDrivenContext MessageDrivenContext context  {    this.context = context;       System.out.println "setMessageDrivenContext" ;     }       public void ejbCreate   throws EJBException {      System.out.println "ejbCreate" ;       try {        InitialContext initContext = new InitialContext  ;         QueueConnectionFactory qcf =  QueueConnectionFactory        626              initContext.lookup "java:comp env jms QCF" ;         connection = qcf.createQueueConnection  ;         session = connection.createQueueSession false,  QueueSession.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE ;         connection.start  ;       }       catch Exception e  {        throw new EJBException "Failed to initialize MyMDB", e ;       }     }       public void ejbRemove   {      System.out.println "ejbRemove" ;       context = null;       try {        if  session != null             session.close  ;         if  connection != null             connection.close  ;       }       catch JMSException e  {        e.printStackTrace  ;       }     }       public void onMessage Message msg  {      System.out.println "onMessage" ;       try {        TextMessage message =  TextMessage  msg;         Queue queue =  Queue  msg.getJMSReplyTo  ;         QueueSender sender = session.createSender queue ;         TextMessage message2 =  session.createTextMessage message.getText   ;         sender.send message2 ;         sender.close  ;       }       catch Exception e  {        e.printStackTrace  ;       }     }   }   Take a look at the ejbCreate method of the message-driven bean class. The first line of code after  writing the method name to the Console is a try block that attempts to get a JNDI InitialContext  object and perform a JNDI lookup to obtain a javax.jms.QueueConnectionFactory object, as  follows:   try {    InitialContext initContext = new InitialContext  ;     QueueConnectionFactory qcf =  QueueConnectionFactory        initContext.lookup "java:comp env jms QCF" ;   After you get the QueueConnectionFactory object, you use its createQueueConnection to  construct a QueueConnection object, like this:   connection = qcf.createQueueConnection  ;   Then, you use the createQueueSession method of the QueueConnection interface to create a  QueueSession object, as in the following code:      627      session = connection.createQueueSession false,  QueueSession.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE ;   Note that you pass false as the first argument to the createQueueSession method to indicate that  you are not creating a transactional session object.   Finally, you start the QueueConnection object by invoking its start method with the following  code:   connection.start  ;   Also important is the onMessage method that is inherited from the MessageListener interface.  This method accepts a javax.jms.Message object representing the message that arrives, as you see  here:   public void onMessage Message msg  {    .     .     .   }   The code assumes that the message is a TextMessage object and tries to cast the message to a  TextMessage object:   try {    TextMessage message =  TextMessage  msg;   The Message interface has the getJMSReplyTo method that returns a javax.jms.Destination object.  Because it is a point-to-point domain, the Destination object should be a Queue object, as follows:   Queue queue =  Queue  msg.getJMSReplyTo  ;   Next, you can call the createSender method of the QueueSession interface, passing a Queue object.  The return value of this method is a message producer, which is a QueueSender:   QueueSender sender = session.createSender queue ;   You then create a TextMessage object based on the message received by passing the text for the  TextMessage to the createTextMessage method of the QueueSession object:   TextMessage message2 = session.createTextMessage message.getText   ;   Now, you are ready to send the new message. You do this by calling the send method of the  QueueSender object, as you see here:   sender.send message2 ;   Finally, you call the close method to close the QueueSender object:   sender.close  ;   The Deployment Descriptor      628                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       Like other EJB applications incorporating session and entity beans, you need a deployment  descriptor to deploy your message-driven bean. The deployment descriptor  ejb-jar.xml file  for  this application is given in Listing 33.2.   Listing 33.2 The Deployment Descriptor       <!DOCTYPE ejb-jar PUBLIC "-  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  DTD Enterprise  JavaBeans 2.0  EN"   "http:  java.sun.com dtd ejb-jar_2_0.dtd">                              MyMDB           com.brainysoftware.ejb.MyMDB           Container           AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE                       javax.jms.Queue                                 jms QCF             javax.jms.QueueConnectionFactory             Container                                Note that under the   element in Listing 33.2, you have the <acknowledge- mode> element that contains the value of AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE.   Configuring the jboss.xml File   Specific to deploying the message-driven bean in JBoss, you need to configure the jboss.xml file  with the file given in Listing 33.3.   Listing 33.3 The jboss.xml File                                MyMDB           queue MyQueue                       jms QCF             QueueConnectionFactory                                The reason you need a jboss.xml file is twofold.   First, the deployment descriptor does not specify the name of the queue the MyMDB bean listens  to. Therefore, the queue must be specified by the bean deployer by incorporating this information      629      in the jboss.xml file. Message-driven beans must always have a jboss.xml file for the specification  of the destination name from which the beans are to receive messages.   The second reason you need a jboss.xml file is that you need to map the JMS  QueueConnectionFactory reference in the deployment descriptor to the deployed JNDI name of  the JBossMQ QueueConnectionFactory.   Packaging Your Message-Driven Bean   Now you are ready to package your entity bean. Do the following:   1.  Compile all the .java class and place the .class files in the com brainysoftware ejb    directory under your project directory.   2.  Change directory to your project directory.  3.  Type the following command:   jar cfv mdb.jar com brainysoftware ejb MyMDB.class META- INF ejb-jar.xml   This command creates a .jar file called mdb.jar in the project directory. Copy this file into the  deploy directory of JBoss. If JBoss is not running, start JBoss. If JBoss is already running, you  don't need to do anything. JBoss's hot deploy feature will automatically try to deploy any package  file saved into the deploy directory.   Writing the Client Application   To invoke the message-driven bean you deployed, you need a client application. You can use the  application you developed in Chapter 32.     Summary   In this chapter, you learned how to write a message-driven bean by implementing the  javax.ejb.MessageDrivenBean and the javax.jms.MessageListener interfaces. You also learned  both how to develop an EJB application that uses a message-driven bean and how to deploy it in  the JBoss application server.      630      Part IV: Appendixes   Part IV Appendixes     A Tomcat Installation and Configuration    B The javax.servlet Package Reference    C The javax.servlet.http Package Reference    D The javax.servlet.jsp Package Reference    E The javax.servlet.jsp.tagext Package Reference    F JBoss Installation and Configuration    G Related Resources     H What's On the CD-ROM?      631      Appendix A. Tomcat Installation and Configuration   Tomcat is the most popular reference implementation for servlets and JSP. At the time of this  writing, the latest version of Tomcat at the time of this writing is 4.0.3, which implements the  Servlet 2.3 and JSP 1.2 APIs. You need Tomcat or another reference implementation to run your  servlets and JSP pages.   This appendix explains the installation and configuration of Tomcat in Windows NT 2000, UNIX,  and Linux.     Tomcat Installation   Tomcat is written in Java. As such, it needs a Java compiler. Therefore, the first step in the  installation is to download and install a JDK. Tomcat works with JDK 1.2 and later. The directory  where you install the JDK is referred to as %JAVA_HOME%. The next steps vary, depending on  the operating system on which you are installing Tomcat. The sections that follow explain the  installation procedures for the different operating systems.   Note   If you have worked with previous versions of Tomcat, you'll see that installing Tomcat  4.0.x is much simpler than the previous versions.   Windows NT 2000 Installation   The key to installing Tomcat 4.0.x on Windows NT 2000 is the setting of the JAVA_HOME  Environment variable. To install Tomcat on Windows NT 2000, follow these steps:   1.  Download Tomcat binary from Apache Software Foundation's web site at   http:  jakarta.apache.org builds jakarta-tomcat-4.0 release . Download the latest release  version. For Windows installation, the easiest option for you may be to download the zip  file. You can extract this file using your favorite zip program, such as WinZip. However,  if you prefer, you can download any other file format.   2.  Extract the compressed file into a directory. This directory is referred to as   %CATALINA_HOME%.   3.  Now you need to add the JAVA_HOME environment variable. Open the Control Panel   and double-click the System applet.   4.  Click the Advanced tab. You should see something similar to Figure A.1.   Figure A.1. The Advanced tab of the System applet in the Control Panel.      632      5.  Click the Environment Variables button. You should see a screen similar to Figure A.2.  You see two sections: the list of environment variables for the current user and the list of  System environment variables. Add the new variable to the latter so that Tomcat can be  used by other users.   Figure A.2. The Environment Variables dialog box.         633      6.  Click the New button in the System Variables section. The New System Variable dialog   box appears  see Figure A.3 .   Figure A.3. The New System Variable dialog box.         7.   In the Variable Name box, type JAVA_HOME. In the Variable Value box, type the JDK  installation directory. For example, if you installed the JDK in C:\jdk1.3 directory, enter  C:\jdk1.3.  8.  Click OK.   Now Tomcat is ready.   To run Tomcat, change the directory to the bin directory under %CATALINA_HOME%, and then  type startup and press Enter.   Alternatively, you can use the following command:   %CATALINA_HOME%\bin\startup      634      Tomcat runs in a new console window. To stop Tomcat, simply close the console window.   In testing your servlet and JSP applications, you will need to start and stop Tomcat frequently. To  help you run Tomcat quickly, you can create the following batch file and put in on the desktop:   cd C:\   cd InstallDirectory\bin   startup   In this code, InstallDirectory is the directory where you install Tomcat.   Now you can run Tomcat by double-clicking the batch file's icon.   To test whether Tomcat was installed properly, open your browser on the same computer you used  to install Tomcat and direct it to the following URL:   http:  localhost:8080   Warning   8080 is needed because Tomcat runs on port 8080 by default. Note you should not omit  the http:   part of the URL.   You should see an image similar to Figure A.4.   Figure A.4. Successful Tomcat installation.   If your computer is connected to a network, you can open the browser on a different computer and  direct it to the following URL:      http:  hostName:8080      635      In this line, hostName is the name of the computer on which Tomcat was installed.   UNIX Linux Installation   Installation on UNIX Linux is as simple as installation on Windows NT 2000, if not simpler.  Again the key here is to create the: JAVA_HOME environment variable. In this example, it is  assumed that JDK has been installed to the  usr local jdk1.3 directory. If you install the JDK and  Tomcat in different directories, you need to change the code accordingly. The following steps  show you how to install Tomcat on a UNIX Linux computer:   1.  Download Tomcat from the Apache Software Foundation's web site at   2.  Extract the installation file to a directory. This directory will become   http:  jakarta.apache.org.   %CATALINA_HOME%.   following command:   3.  Add the JAVA_HOME environment variable. If you are using the bash shell, type the   JAVA_HOME= usr local jdk1.3   export JAVA_HOME   If you are using tcsh, type the following command:   setenv JAVA_HOME  usr local jdk1.3   Your Tomcat installation is now complete. To start Tomcat, run the startup.sh file in the bin  directory under %CATALINA_HOME%. For example, from the bin directory, you can  type . startup.sh.   To stop Tomcat, run the shutdown.sh file in the bin directory under %CATALINA_HOME%. For  example, from the bin directory, type . shutdown.sh.   To test whether Tomcat was installed properly, open your browser on the computer on which you  installed Tomcat and direct it to the following URL:   http:  localhost:8080   Note that you should not omit the http:   part of the URL. You should see an image similar to the  one shown in Figure A.4.   If your computer is connected to the network, you can open the browser in a different computer  and direct it to the following URL:   In this line, hostName is the computer name where Tomcat was installed.   http:  hostName:8080     Tomcat Directories   When you install Tomcat, the installation program creates a number of directories under  %CATALINA_HOME%. Understanding the function of each subdirectory is important to  configuring Tomcat and deploying your servlet and JSP applications.      636      The directories under %CATALINA_HOME% are shown in Table A.1.   Table A.1. Subdirectories Under %CATALINA_HOME%   Directory  bin  Startup and shutdown scripts and other files.  classes  Unpacked classes global to web applications.  conf   Description   Configuration files including server.xml  Tomcat's main configuration file  and the  global web.xml  deployment descriptor  file.

By default, Tomcat runs on port 8080. As a result, your users must always type the port  number :8080 after the domain part in the URL. In fact, users must always type the port number  unless Tomcat is run on port 80, the default port for HTTP.   You can change this by editing the Tomcat configuration file server.xml located in the conf  directory under %CATALINA_HOME%.   First you need to find the following lines:       <Connector  className="org.apache.catalina.connector.http.HttpConnector"     port="8080" minProcessors="5" maxProcessors="75"     enableLookups="true" redirectPort="8443"     acceptCount="10" debug="0" connectionTimeout="60000"    >   You can see that in the third line there is the port attribute with a value of 8080. Change that value  to 80 and save the file.   You need to restart Tomcat for this change to take effect. Now, you can call any page without  including the port number in the URL.   On the UNIX Linux platform, if you want to run a process using port numbers less than 1024, you  must log in as the super user.   Note that you must not change Tomcat port to 80 if you are going to run Tomcat with other web  servers, as discussed in the following sections.     Constructing a JSP Application      637      For each JSP application, you need a directory structure similar to that in Figure A.2, which shows  a directory structure for an application called mail  highlighted . The mail directory is created  under the webapps directory. In this example, there are other applications: admin, examples,  ROOT, and test.   Underneath each JSP application are two important subdirectories: jsp and WEB-INF. Clearly, the  jsp directory is for your JSP files, and it can contain subdirectories to organize your files. You also  can place your static HTML files here.   WEB-INF holds two important subdirectories, classes and lib, and a configuration file called  web.xml. For simple applications, you need only to copy the web.xml from the WEB-INF  directory of one of the sample applications included with Tomcat installation and make  modifications to this file.   The classes subdirectory is there for you to store classes such as JavaBeans that are needed by  your application. The lib subdirectory is where you store archived Java class files that support  your JSP application.   You also need to edit the server.xml file if you have placed your application outside the webapps  directory. The Linux installation requires that you have the META-INF directory under your  application even though you don't need to do anything to it.      638                                                                                                             Team-FlyÂ®       Appendix B. The javax.servlet Package Reference   The Servlet 2.3 Specification defines two Java extension packages for developers who want to  work with the servlet technology: the javax.servlet package and the javax.servlet.http package.  The first package provides generic classes and interfaces that are protocol independent, and the  second package, javax.servlet.http, contains classes and interfaces specific to HTTP.   This appendix presents the complete reference on the javax.servlet package. The javax.servlet.http  package is presented in Appendix C, "The javax.servlet.http Package Reference." For brevity, a  class or interface that belongs to the javax.servlet package is not written in its fully qualified name.   The javax.servlet package contains twelve interfaces, seven classes, and two exceptions. Figure  B.1 shows the UML diagram for this package.   Figure B.1. The UML diagram for the javax.servlet package.   Tables B.1 and B.2, summarize the package interfaces, classes, and exceptions, respectively.   Table B.1. The Interfaces in the javax.servlet Package   Description      Interface   Filter   FilterChain   FilterConfig   RequestDispatcher   This interface represents a filter. A filter intercepts a request  before the request is handled and can perform tasks on the  request, the response, or both.  The servlet container creates a FilterChain object to provide a  view into the invocation chain of a filtered request for a resource. The servlet container creates a FilterConfig object from which  information, such as the filter name and initial parameters, can be  obtained.  Defines an object that dispatches a request to another dynamic  resource, such as a servlet or a JSP page.      639   ServletContextAttributeListener A class implementing this interface is used to receive notification   The main interface that all servlets must implement either  directly or indirectly.  Represents a servlet configuration object from which  information, such as the servlet name, initial parameters, and the  ServletContext object, can be obtained.  The ServletContext object is the interface between the servlet  container and a servlet. One ServletContext object exists for each  web application per Java Virtual Machine  JVM . In situations  where the whole application resides the same JVM, the  ServletContext object can be used to share global information  that will be available to any resource in the application.   of changes to the ServletContext object's attribute.

Each of the following sections  describe an interface, its signature, and the interface's methods, if any.   640   The Filter interface represents a filter. You implement this interface to create a filter that intercepts  a request and performs tasks on the request, the response to the request, or both.      public interface Filter   Signature   Methods   public void destroy     The web container invokes this method when the filter is about to be taken out of service. The web  container will wait until all threads within the filter's doFilter method have exited or after a  timeout period has passed before calling this method. After this method is invoked, the web  container will not call the doFilter method again upon this instance of the filter.   You can use this method to do some cleanup, such as releasing an object, closing a file, and so on.   public void doFilter ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response,  FilterChain chain    throws java.io.IOException, ServletException   The web container invokes this method when a request response pair is passed through the chain  due to a client request for a resource path at the end of the chain:   public void init FilterConfig filterConfig  throws ServletException   The web container calls this method when the filter is about to be put into service.   The servlet container creates a FilterChain object to provide a view into the invocation chain of a  filtered request for a resource.   public interface FilterChain   public void doFilter ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response   throws   java.io.IOException, ServletException   Causes the next filter in the chain to be invoked. If the calling filter is the last in the chain, it  causes the resource at the end of the chain to be invoked.   A filter configuration object that passes information from the web container to a filter.   FilterChain   Signature   Methods   FilterConfig   Signature   public interface FilterConfig      641      Methods   public java.lang.String getFilterName     Returns the name of the filter defined in the application's deployment descriptor.   public java.lang.String getInitParameter java.lang.String name    Returns the value of the specified initialization parameter, or returns null if the parameter does not  exist.   public java.util.Enumeration getInitParameterNames     Returns all the names of the filter's initialization parameter.   public ServletContext getServletContext     Returns the ServletContext object.   RequestDispatcher   public interface RequestDispatcher   Signature   Methods   Defines an object that dispatches a request to another dynamic resource, such as a servlet or a JSP  page.   public void forward ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response    throws java.io.IOException, ServletException   Forwards the servlet's request object to another static or dynamic resource.   public void include ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response    throws java.io.IOException, ServletException   Includes the processing output of another static or dynamic resource. In a nutshell, this has the  same effect as a programmatic server-side include.   The Servlet interface is the central abstraction of the Java servlet technology. All servlets must  implement this interface either directly or indirectly.   Servlet   Signature   Methods   public interface Servlet   public void destroy        642      This is one of the life-cycle methods that is called by the servlet container when the servlet is  being taken out of service.   public ServletConfig getServletConfig     Returns the servlet's ServletConfig object containing initialization and startup parameters.   public java.lang.String getServletInfo     Returns information about the current servlet.   public void init ServletConfig config    This is one of the life-cycle methods called by the servlet container when the servlet is being  placed into service.   public void service ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response    throws java.io.IOException, ServletException   This is one of the life-cycle methods called by the servlet container when the servlet is requested,  to allow the servlet to respond to a request.   ServletConfig   This interface represents a servlet configuration object that passes information from the servlet  container to a servlet during the servlet initialization.   public interface ServletConfig   Signature   Methods   public java.lang.String getInitParameter java.lang.String name    Returns the value of the specified initialization parameter, or returns null if the parameter does not  exist.   public java.util.Enumeration getInitParameterNames     Returns an Enumeration containing all the parameter names of the servlet.   public ServletContext getServletContext     Returns the ServletContext object.   public java.lang.String getServletName     Returns the servlet name as specified in the application deployment descriptor.   ServletContext   The ServletContext object is the interface between the servlet container and a servlet. There is one  ServletContext object for each web application per Java Virtual Machine  JVM . In those cases in      643   which the whole application resides in the same JVM, the ServletContext object can be used to  share global information that will be available to any resource in the application.

In Servlet API  2.3, it always returns an empty Enumeration object.   public void log java.lang.Exception exception, java.lang.String  message    This method is deprecated. It was originally used to write an exception's stack trace and an error  message to the servlet log file.   public void log java.lang.String message    Writes a message to the servlet log file.   public void log java.lang.String message, java.lang.Throwable  throwable    Writes an error message and a stack trace for the Throwable object specified as the argument.   public void removeAttribute java.lang.String name       645      Signature   Methods   Removes the attribute whose name is specified as the argument from the ServletContext object.   public void setAttribute java.lang.String name, java.lang.Object  object    Binds an object to a name in the ServletContext object. If an attribute with the same name already  exists, the attribute value will be replaced with the new object.   ServletContextAttributeListener   A class implementing this interface is used to receive notification of changes to the ServletContext  object's attribute.   public interface ServletContextAttributeListener extends  java.util.EventListener   public void attributeAdded ServletContextAttributeEvent scae    This method is called after an attribute is added to the ServletContext object.   public void attributeRemoved ServletContextAttributeEvent scae    This method is called after an attribute is removed from the ServletContext object.   public void attributeReplaced ServletContextAttributeEvent scae    This method is called after an attribute is replaced in the ServletContext object.   ServletContextListener   A class implementing this interface is used to receive notification of changes to the ServletContext  object.   public interface ServletContextListener extends  java.util.EventListener   Signature   Methods   public void contextDestroyed ServletContextEvent sce    This method is called as a notification that the ServletContext object is about to be destroyed; that  is, the servlet container is about to be shut down.   public void contextInitialized ServletContextEvent sce    This method is called as a notification that the ServletContext object is about to be initialized; that  is, the web application is ready to service clients' requests.      646      Signature   Methods   ServletRequest   Represents a request from a web client.   public interface ServletRequest   public java.lang.Object getAttribute java.lang.String name    Obtains the attribute whose name is specified in the argument from the ServletRequest object.

The javax.servlet.http Package  Reference   This appendix presents the javax.servlet.http package as defined in the Servlet 2.3 Specification.  This is the second of the two packages used in the servlet application development. The other  package, javax.servlet, was given in Appendix B, "The javax.servlet Package Reference."   For brevity, in the description of each class and interface in this appendix, a type that belongs to  the javax.servlet.http package is not written in its fully qualified name.   The javax.servlet.http package contains eight interfaces and seven classes. Figure C.1 shows the  UML diagram for this package.   Figure C.1. The UML diagram for the javax.servlet.http package.      Tables C.1 and C.2 summarize the package interfaces and classes, respectively.   Table C.1. The Interfaces in the javax.servlet.http Package   Interface  HttpServletRequest  HttpServletResponse  HttpSession   Description   Represents an HTTP client request.  Represents an HTTP response from the server.  This interface defines a session specific to the user requesting the  servlet.   HttpSessionActivationListener A class implementing this interface is used to receive notification   when the session will be passivated and activated.   HttpSessionAttributeListener  A class implementing this interface is used to receive notification   of changes to the HttpSession object's attribute.      659      HttpSessionBindingListener  A class implementing this interface receives notification when it is   HttpSessionContext   HttpSessionListener   bound to or unbound from a session.  This interface has been deprecated as of Servlet API 2.1 for  security reasons.  A class implementing this interface receives notification when  there is a change to the list of active sessions.   Table C.2. The Classes in the javax.servlet.http Package   Class   Description   Cookie  HttpServlet  HttpServletRequestWrapper  A wrapper class for working conveniently with the   Defines a cookie.  An abstract class to be subclassed by an HTTP servlet.   HttpServletRequest interface.   HttpServletResponseWrapper A wrapper class for working conveniently with the   HttpServletResponse interface.  Events of this type are sent to an object implementing  HttpSessionBindingListener when it is bound or unbound from a  session, or to a HttpSessionAttributeListener that has been  configured in the deployment descriptor when an attribute is bound,  unbound, or replaced in a session.  Represents event notification for changes to session objects.  This class has been deprecated as of Servlet API 2.3 and its  methods have been moved to the request interfaces.

The javax.servlet.jsp Package  Reference   The JSP 1.2 Specification defines two Java extension packages for developers who want to work  with the servlet technology: the javax.servlet.jsp package and the javax.servlet.jsp.tagext package.  This appendix contains the complete reference of the javax.servlet.jsp package. The  javax.servlet.jsp.tagext package is presented in Appendix E, "The javax.servlet.jsp.tagext Package  Reference."   In this appendix, a type that belongs to the javax.servlet.jsp package is not written in its fully  qualified name.   Tables D.1 and D.2 summarize the package interfaces and classes, respectively.   Table D.1. The Interfaces in the javax.servlet.jsp Package   Interface  HttpJspPage This interface defines a contract between a JSP page implementation class and a JSP   Description   container. Objects of this type are obtained from the JspFactory class.

An abstract class that needs to be subclassed so that the JSP container can  provide implementation-dependent implementations.   PageContext       Interfaces   HttpJspPage   Signature   The following are the interfaces in the javax.servlet.jsp package. Each of the following sections  describes an interface, its signature, and its methods, if any.   This interface defines a contract between a JSP page implementation class and a JSP container.  Objects of this type are obtained from the JspFactory class.      679      Method   JspPage   Signature   Methods       Classes   Signature   Method   public interface HttpJspPage extends JspPage   public void _jspService javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest request,   javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse response    throws javax.servlet.ServletException, java.io.IOException   This method is defined automatically by the JSP container and should not be defined by the JSP  page author.   This interface is the superinterface of the HttpJspPage interface and defines a contract between a  JSP page implementation class and a JSP container.

JBoss Installation and Configuration   The JBoss server  www.jboss.org  is a J2EE-compliant application server that is implemented in  100 percent pure Java. Distributed under the GNU public license, JBoss is totally free. There is no  per-CPU licensing scheme, and no fee for even commercial use.   The zero cost is not the only factor that differentiates JBoss from competitors, however. JBoss  prides itself in having features such as "hot deploy," "dynamic proxies," and a JMX-based fully  modular design that enables you to replace virtually every component of the server. That is  something you can't find even in commercial products, no matter how deep you are willing to put  your hand in your pocket. Also important is the fact that JBoss is relatively slim, consuming less  memory and disk space, making it much faster to start up. Currently at version 2.4.4, JBoss also  comes equipped with a built-in SQL database server for handling persistent beans. This addition  makes installation easier because you don't need to download and install a separate product. This  database server starts up automatically when you start the server, unlike some competing products  where the database server has to be started separately. The "no cost for ownership" nature of JBoss  does not mean performance is being compromised. There is a report in which JBoss outperforms  some of the market leaders in this field.   Yes, sure, JBoss has some weaknesses, too. Like most open source products, JBoss lacks  documentation. There are several how-to articles available; however, these are far from sufficient.  And, of course, there is no technical support even though training and consulting are available  from the JBoss Group  not free, of course . If you have a problem, basically you just have to rely  on the mailing list to find your answers. Browsing through the archive before you start coding can  be useful because at least you will then know what to expect.     System Requirements   Both Windows and Linux versions of JBoss require Java Development Kit  JDK  1.3 to run.   Hardware-wise, you need a machine with at least 64 megabytes of RAM. I could not find any  specification telling the lowest breed of CPU JBoss needs. When I install it on my Pentium  550MHz machine, however, I get satisfactory performance. Of course, like other server-based  software, the more RAM and CPU power, the better. In terms of hard disk space, JBoss requires  only a few megabytes of your hard disk.     Installing JBoss   JBoss installation is relatively simple and straightforward. In fact, ease of installation is one of  JBoss's strong points. Before you do the installation, however, make sure that your JDK is  working.   Windows Installations   To install JBoss on a Windows machine, do the following steps:   1.  Download the binary package  in .zip format  from http:  www.jboss.org binary.jsp in the   DownloadâBinary section. Save this zip file into a temporary directory.      702              2.  Unzip the downloaded file using WinZip or a similar product and extract the compressed   files into a directory, such as C:\jboss. This directory is called the JBOSS_HOME  directory.   That's it.   Linux Installations   Follow these steps to install JBoss on Linux:   1.  Download the binary file from http:  www.jboss.org binary.jsp into a temporary directory:   lynx -source http:  www.jboss.org bin jboss-2.1.zip > jboss- 2.1.zip   2.  Select an install directory. In this example, assume that  usr local is used as the install   directory.   3.  Change directory to this select directory  4.  Decompress the binary file. If you have downloaded the binary as a zip file into the  tmp  directory, the command to unzip it is unzip  tmp jboss-2.x.zip. The files will be extracted  into the jboss directory under your install directory. This is your JBOSS_HOME directory.  If your install directory is  usr local, your JBOSS_HOME directory is  usr local jboss.   If the installation goes smoothly, you should be able to see a directory structure like the one shown  in Figure F.1.   Figure F.1. JBoss directory structure.      703      bin   db   deploy   log   conf   client   Directory Structure   All directories referred to in the next sections are relative to JBOSS_HOME; that is, the top  directory of the JBoss installation. The directories are described in the following sections.   All the binaries included with JBoss distribution are located in this directory. Of most importance  are the run.bat and the run.sh files that you use to start JBoss on Windows and Linux, respectively.   lib and lib ext   These two directories contain Java libraries in the .jar and .zip formats that JBoss uses. There is a  split between those libraries that had to be in the system classpath  that is, jars in lib directory   versus the ones in lib ext directory, which are made available to the JBoss server MLet based  classloader. If you need to add some Java libraries to JBossâfor example jdbc driver jarsâyou  should drop the libraries in the lib ext directory. These will be picked up by JBoss automatically.   Directory containing hypersonic and instantdb databases related files  configuration files, indexing  tables, and so on  as well as JBossMQâJava Messaging System  JMS  provider message queue  files.   The deployment directory. Just drop your jars here and they will be deployed automatically.   The directory for log files. File logging is on by default.   JBoss configuration set s  are located here. By default there is only one configuration set: default.  However, you can add one or more configuration sets if you like.   Libraries required for clients are in the client directory. A typical client requires jboss-client.jar,  jbosssx-client.jar, jaas.jar, jnp-client.jar, ejb.jar, and jta-spec1_0_1.jar. If your client is not running  JDK 1.3, it will require jndi.jar as well. If you are going to be using JBossMQ JMS provider, you  also will need jbossmq-client.jar.     Configuration   There's basically nothing you need to do to get JBoss up and running. You might need to make  minor configuration changes to support your specific applications, however. If you do make  configuration changes, consult the Advanced Configuration section of the online documentation.      704          Running JBoss     Deployment     JBoss and Tomcat   To run JBoss on Linux, follow these steps:      Make sure that you have write permission to the JBoss directory  needed for log files and   deployment       Change to the bin directory under the JBoss directory and then type . run.sh   Running JBoss on Windows is even easier: you need only to change the directory to the bin  directory, and then run the run.bat file.   The server should start without any error messages or exceptions being thrown. It will produce  several pages of output on startup.   This is one of the nice features of JBoss. To deploy a bean, simply copy its .jar file into the deploy  directory under the JBoss home directory. If you do this when the bean is already loaded, JBoss  automatically unloads it, and then loads the new version.   If your EJB client is a servlet or a JSP page, you surely need Tomcat, the servlet JSP container, to  execute your servlet JSP. For better performance, you may want to run Tomcat in the same Virtual  Machine as JBoss. The JBoss organization has finished integrating the JBoss server with Tomcat  version 4.0.1. You can download this package and install it on your computer without any fuss.   In a typical web application, however, you normally have static HTML pages as well as dynamic  pages. Allowing Tomcat to serve HTML pages as well is not an efficient approach. The solution is  usually to install a scalable web server, such as Apache, at the front. Only requests for servlet JSP  pages are forwarded to Tomcat.   When Tomcat is integrated inside JBoss, running Tomcat as an Apache module makes the system  installation more complex. In brief, there is not yet one single download installation that requires  no configuration that can integrate JBoss with Tomcat and a web server. Hopefully, this will be  available in not-too-distant future. When this is finished, JBoss can deliver much better system  performance and still provides easy installation and configuration.     Summary   JBoss is free and has proven itself a high performer. Its strong features include easy installation  and hot deployment.      705   Appendix G.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU  Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]   Preamble   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By  contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and  change free softwareâto make sure the software is free for all its users.   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software  packagesâtypically librariesâof the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to  use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the  ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the  explanations below.   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public  Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software   and charge for this service if you wish ; that you receive source code or can get it if you want it;  that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are  informed that you can do these things.   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these  rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities  for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the  recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the  source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the  recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and  recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.   We protect your rights with a two-step method:  1  we copyright the library, and  2  we offer you  this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and or modify the library.   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free  library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know  that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be  affected by problems that might be introduced by others.   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to  make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a  restrictive license from a patent holder.      710      Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent  with the full freedom of use specified in this license. Most GNU software, including some  libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser  General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the  ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking  those libraries into non-free programs.   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the  combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination  fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking  other code with the library.   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's  freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers  Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we  use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides  advantages in certain special circumstances.   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use  of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs  must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as  widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free  oftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater  number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C  Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNUoperating system,  as well as its variant, the GNU Linux operating system.   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure  that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to  run that program using a modified version of the Library.   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close  attention to the difference between "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the  library in order to run.     GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION   This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice  placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the  terms of this Lesser General Public License  also called "this License" . Each licensee is addressed  as "you".   A "library" means a collection of software functions and or data prepared so as to be conveniently  linked with application programs  which use some of those functions and data  to form  executables.      711      The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed  under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative work  under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim  or with modifications and or translated straightforwardly into another language.  Hereinafter,  translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".    "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For  a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of  the library. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this  License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted,  and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the  Library  independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it . Whether that is true  depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you  receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each  copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that  refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License  along with the Library.   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer  warranty protection in exchange for a fee.   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work  based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of  Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:   The modified work must itself be a software library.   You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files  and the date of any change.   c  You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the  terms of this License.   d  If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an  application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is  invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does  not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its  purpose remains meaningful.    For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well- defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application- supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not  supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are  not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute  them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a  work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,  whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part  regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your  rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the  distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. In addition, mere aggregation      712      of another work not based on the Library with the Library  or with a work based on the Library   on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of  this License.   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this  License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this  License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to  this License.  If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has  appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.  Do not make any other change in  these notices.   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU  General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is  not a library.   4. You may copy and distribute the Library  or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2  in  object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you  accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be  distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software  interchange.   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then  offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to  distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along  with the object code.   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work  with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such  a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of  this License. However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an  executable that is a derivative of the Library  because it contains portions of the Library , rather  than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6  states terms for distribution of such executables.   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the  object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is  not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or  if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. If  such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small  macros and small inline functions  ten lines or less in length , then the use of the object file is  unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work.  Executables containing this  object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.  Otherwise, if the work is a  derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of  Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are  linked directly with the Library itself.   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the  Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that  work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the  customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that  the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the  work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the      713      Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also,  you must do one of these things:   Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the  Library including whatever changes were used in the work  which must be distributed under  Sections 1 and 2 above ; and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the  complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and or source code, so  that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing  the modified Library.  It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files  in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified  definitions.    Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one  that  1  uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, rather  than copying library functions into the executable, and  2  will operate properly with a modified  version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface- compatible with the version that the work was made with.   Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the  materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this  distribution.   If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer  equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.   e  Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent  this user a copy.   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data and  utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,  the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed  in either  source or binary form  with the major components  compiler, kernel, and so on  of the operating  system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary  libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you  cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single  library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a  combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of  the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:   a  Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library,  uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the  Sections above.   b  Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on  the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly  provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or  distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have  their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.      714      9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else  grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the  Library  or any work based on the Library , you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,  and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based  on it.   10. Each time you redistribute the Library  or any work based on the Library , the recipient  automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify  the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on  the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing  compliance by third parties with this License.   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other  reason  not limited to patent issues , conditions are imposed on you  whether by court order,  agreement or otherwise  that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you  from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your  obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may  not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free  redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,  then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from  distribution of the Library.   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance,  the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in  other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or  other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole  purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented  by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of  software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is  up to the author donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other  system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear  what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.   12. If the distribution and or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or  by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that  distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License  incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and or new versions of the Lesser General  Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,  but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a  distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which  applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the  Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by  the Free Software Foundation.   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution  conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software  which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we  sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving  the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of  software generally.      715        NO WARRANTY   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS  AND OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF  ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,  THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND  PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE  DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR  CORRECTION.   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN  WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY  MODIFY AND OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE  TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE  LIBRARY  INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING  RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A  FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE , EVEN IF  SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF  SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS   How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we  recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by  permitting redistribution under these terms  or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary  General Public License .   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the  start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should  have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give  the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright  C        This library is free software; you can redistribute it and or modify it under the terms of the GNU  Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of  the License, or  at your option  any later version.   This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY;  without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.   You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this  library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston,  MA 02111-1307 USA Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.  You should also get your employer  if you work as a programmer  or your school, if any, to sign a  "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names: Yoyodyne,  Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library 'Frob'  a library for tweaking knobs   written by James Random Hacker.
