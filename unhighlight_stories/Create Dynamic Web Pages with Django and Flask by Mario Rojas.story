This	information	is	essential	to	web	developers	so	they	can	make	proper use	of	their	web	server	and	provide	the	best	web	experience	to	their	users.  All	web	servers	use	the	same	building	blocks	to	serve	up	web	pages	to	the	user. While	we	could	look	at	all	the	available	web	servers,	it	really	is	not	necessary since	they	all	are	designed	around	the	same	building	blocks.	Instead,	we	will concentrate	on	the	Apache	web	server	since	it	is	the	most	popular.	All	the	other web	servers	use	the	same	building	blocks	and	design	principles	as	the	Apache server.  Glossary	of	Terms  When	delving	into	technical	information,	it	is	important	that	you	understand	the terminology	used.	For	that	reason,	please	review	the	following	web	server	terms:   	Common	Gateway	Interface	 CGI :	This	describes	a	process	that	serves	up	a dynamic	web	page.	The	web	page	is	built	by	a	program	provided	by	the	web server	administrator.	A	common	set	of	information	is	available	to	the	program via	the	program’s	environment.    	Hypertext	Transport	Protocol	 HTTP :	This	is	a	set	of	rules	used	to	describe	a request	by	the	user	to	the	web	server	and	the	returned	information.	The	request and	the	reply	must	follow	strict	rules	for	the	request	to	be	understood	by	the server	and	for	the	reply	to	be	understood	by	the	user’s	browser.   	Hypertext	Markup	Language	 HTML :	This	code	is	used	to	build	a	web	page that	is	displayed	by	a	browser,	and	the	Apache	web	server	is	used	to	serve	the web	page	to	users	 clients .	There	are	several	versions	of	this	code,	but	we	will be	using	the	latest	version	 5.0 	in	this	book.   	Cascading	Style	Sheets	 CSS :	These	sheets	define	the	styles	to	be	used	by	one or	more	web	pages.	These	styles	are	used	to	define	fonts,	colors,	and	the	size	of a	section	of	text	within	a	defined	area	of	the	HTML	page.  These	terms	should	give	you	a	good	starting	point	for	discussing	how	a	web server	works.	All	of	these	terms	will	receive	wider	attention	and	definition throughout	this	book.  The	Apache	Web	Server  The	Apache	web	server	 today	this	is	known	formally	as	the	HTTP	Server 	dates back	to	the	mid-1990s	when	it	started	gaining	widespread	use.	The	web	server	is a	project	of	the	Apache	Software	Foundation,	which	manages	several	projects. There	are	currently	more	than	200	million	lines	of	code	managed	by	the foundation	for	the	Apache	web	server.	The	current	release	as	of	this	writing	is 2.4.41.  Starting	with	Apache	version	2.0,	Apache	uses	a	hook	architecture	to	define	new functionality	via	modules.	We	will	study	this	in	a	subsequent	chapter.  When	you	first	look	at	hooks,	they	will	seem	a	little	complicated,	but	in	reality, they	are	not	since	most	of	the	time	you	are	only	modifying	Apache	a	little.	This will	reduce	the	code	you	need	to	write	to	implement	a	hook	to	a	minimum.  The	Apache	web	server	uses	a	config	file	to	define	everything	the	server	needs to	know	about	all	the	hooks	you	want	to	include	in	Apache.	It	also	defines	the main	server	and	any	virtual	servers	you	want	to	include.	In	addition,	it	defines the	name	of	the	server,	the	home	directory	for	the	server,	the	CGI	directory	to	be used,	any	aliases	needed	by	the	server,	the	server	name,	any	specific	handlers used	by	that	server,	the	port	to	be	used	by	the	server,	the	error	log	to	be	used,   used	by	that	server,	the	port	to	be	used	by	the	server,	the	error	log	to	be	used, and	several	other	factors.  Once	configuration	is	complete,	the	Apache	server	is	now	ready	to	supply	files to	a	client	browser.	This	is	called	the	request-response	cycle.	For	each	request sent	by	the	browser	to	the	server,	the	request	must	travel	through	the	request- response	cycle	to	produce	a	response	that	is	sent	back	to	the	browser.	While	this looks	simple	on	the	surface,	the	requestresponse	cycle	is	both	powerful	and flexible.	It	can	allow	programs	you	create,	called	modules,	to	modify	both	the request	and	the	response	in	many	flexible	ways.	A	module	can	also	create	the response	from	scratch	and	can	include	inputs	from	resources	outside	of	Apache, such	as	a	database	or	other	external	data	repository.  Figure 1-1	shows	the	request-response	loop	of	Apache	plus	the	startup	and	shutdown phases	of	the	server.   Figure	1-1.	The	Apache	request-response	loop  Modules	not	only	can	be	used	in	the	request-response	cycle	but	in	other	portions   Modules	not	only	can	be	used	in	the	request-response	cycle	but	in	other	portions of	Apache	such	as	during	configuration,	shutdown cleanup,	processing	security requests,	and	other	valuable	functions.	As	you	can	see,	modules	allow	flexible and	powerful	methods	to	be	created	by	the	server	administrator	to	help	with providing	a	great	experience	for	their	users.  Modules	are	not	the	only	way	to	create	dynamic	web	pages.	Another	way	is	by invoking	available	Apache	services	that	can	call	an	external	program	to	create the	page.	The	CGI	process	is	usually	invoked	to	supply	this	service,	but	there	are other	ways	as	well.	Each	of	these	ways	will	be	examined	in	this	book.	It	will	be up	to	you	to	decide	the	best	methodology	for	use	in	your	environment.  The	shaded	request response	loop	can	have	several	forms.	One	such	form	is	as	a loop	inside	one	of	several	processes	under	Apache.	Another	is	running	the	loop as	a	thread	inside	a	single	process	under	Apache.	All	of	these	forms	are	designed to	make	the	most	efficient	process	of	responding	to	a	request	that	an	operating system	may	provide.  The	Keep-Alive	loop	is	for	HTTP	2.0	requests	if	supported	by	the	web	server.	It allows	the	connection	to	stay	open	to	the	client	until	all	requests	have	been processed.	The	loop	here	describes	how	a	single	request	is	processed	by	Apache. If	the	web	server	is	not	running	HTTP	2.0	requests,	then	each	request response will	close	the	connection	once	the	response	has	been	sent.  Nginx	Web	Server  The	Nginx	server	was	designed	as	a	low-cost	 in	terms	of	system	requirements  alternative	to	the	Apache	server.	Probably	the	biggest	difference	between	Nginx and	Apache	is	that	Nginx	has	an	asynchronous	event-driven	architecture	rather than	using	multiple	threads	to	process	each	request.	While	this	can	provide predictable	performance	under	high	loads,	it	does	come	with	some	downsides. For	instance,	a	request	can	end	up	waiting	in	the	queue	longer	than	the	request attempt	will	survive	on	the	network;	i.e.,	the	requester	can	give	up	before	the request	is	ever	processed	if	there	are	too	few	processing	routines.	While	this problem	is	not	exclusive	to	this	server,	it	does	still	exist.  Recently	the	Nginx	server	has	become	popular	within	the	community	because	of its	smaller	footprint	and	flexible	design.	However,	since	many	of	the	principles that	we	will	use	to	describe	the	Apache	server	also	apply	to	the	Nginx	server,	I will	not	delve	deeply	into	Nginx	and	will	discuss	it	only	when	differences between	the	two	servers	are	important,	especially	in	regard	to	dynamic	web	page   between	the	two	servers	are	important,	especially	in	regard	to	dynamic	web	page design.  Apache	Tomcat	Server  The	Apache	Tomcat	server	is	written	in	Java,	which	makes	it	difficult	to compare	to	the	more	standard	web	servers.	While	some	principles	of	dynamic web	page	design	are	similar,	there	are	many	differences.	Therefore,	and	because it’s	less	commonly	used	than	Apache	and	Nginx,	I	will	not	attempt	to	cover	it	in this	book. Configuring	the	Apache	Web	Server  The	Apache	web	server	has	a	single	main	configuration	file	and	a	number	of optional	configuration	files.	The	main	file	is	namedhttpd.conf,	and	it	controls which	optional	files	are	loaded	as	well	as	the	location	where	they	can	be	found. It	also	specifies	the	global	features	used	by	the	server.  Listing	1-1	shows	an	unedited	version	of	thehttpd.conf	file.	Following	the listing,	I	will	describe	the	sections	that	need	to	be	modified	to	give	you	a	usable configuration	file.  Listing	1-1.	The	Unedited	httpd.conf	File  	This	is	the	main	Apache	HTTP	server	configuration	file.  It	contains	the 	configuration	directives	that	give	the	server	its instructions. 	See	 	for	detailed information. 	In	particular,	see 	 		for	a	discussion of	each	configuration	directive.	 	See	the	httpd.conf 5 	man	page	for	more	information	on	this configuration, 	and	httpd.service 8 	on	using	and	configuring	the	httpd	service.	 	Do	NOT	simply	read	the	instructions	in	here	without understanding   understanding 	what	they	do.	They're	here	only	as	hints	or	reminders. If	you	are	unsure 	consult	the	online	docs.	You	have	been	warned.  	Configuration	and	logfile	names:	If	the	filenames	you	specify for	many 	of	the	server's	control	files	begin	with	" "	 or	"drive: " for	Win32 ,	the 	server	will	use	that	explicit	path.	If	the	filenames	do *not*	begin 	with	" ",	the	value	of	ServerRoot	is	prepended	--	so 'log access_log' 	with	ServerRoot	set	to	' www'	will	be	interpreted	by	the		server	as ' www log access_log',	where	as	' log access_log' will	be 	interpreted	as	' log access_log'.      	ServerRoot:	The	top	of	the	directory	tree	under	which	the	server's 	configuration,	error,	and	log	files	are	kept.  	Do	not	add	a	slash	at	the	end	of	the	directory	path.	If	you	point 	ServerRoot	at	a	non-local	disk,	be	sure	to	specify	a	local	disk	on	the 	Mutex	directive,	if	file-based	mutexes	are	used.	If	you	wish	to	share	the 	same	ServerRoot	for	multiple	httpd	daemons,	you	will	need	to	change	at 	least	PidFile.  ServerRoot	" etc httpd"  	Listen:	Allows	you	to	bind	Apache	to	specific	IP	addresses	and or 	ports,	instead	of	the	default.	See	also	the	  	directive.  	Change	this	to	Listen	on	specific	IP	addresses	as	shown	below	to 	prevent	Apache	from	glomming	onto	all	bound	IP	addresses.  Listen	12.34.56.78:80   Listen	12.34.56.78:80 Listen	80 	Dynamic	Shared	Object	 DSO 	Support  	To	be	able	to	use	the	functionality	of	a	module	which	was	built	as	a	DSO	you 	have	to	place	corresponding	`LoadModule'	lines	at	this	location	so	the 	directives	contained	in	it	are	actually	available	_before_	they	are	used. 	Statically	compiled	modules	 those	listed	by	`httpd	-l' 	do	not	need 	to	be	loaded	here.  	Example: 	LoadModule	foo_module	modules mod_foo.so  Include	conf.modules.d *.conf      	If	you	wish	httpd	to	run	as	a	different	user	or	group,	you	must	run 	httpd	as	root	initially	and	it	will	switch.  	User Group:	The	name	 or	number 	of	the	user group	to	run	httpd	as. 	It	is	usually	good	practice	to	create	a	dedicated	user	and	group	for 	running	httpd,	as	with	most	system	services.  User	apache Group	apache 	'Main'	server	configuration  	The	directives	in	this	section	set	up	the	values	used	by	the	'main'		server, which	responds	to	any	requests	that	aren't	handled	by	a		  definition.	These	values	also	provide	defaults	for		any	 	containers you	may	define	later	in	the	file.	 	All	of	these	directives	may	appear	inside	 	containers, 	in	which	case	these	default	settings	will	be	overridden	for	the 	virtual	host	being	defined.   	ServerAdmin:	Your	address,	where	problems	with	the	server	should	be   	ServerAdmin:	Your	address,	where	problems	with	the	server	should	be 	e-mailed.	This	address	appears	on	some	server-generated	pages,	such 	as	error	documents.	e.g.	admin@your-domain.com  ServerAdmin	root@localhost    	ServerName	gives	the	name	and	port	that	the	server	uses	to	identify	itself. 	This	can	often	be	determined	automatically,	but	we	recommend	you	specify 	it	explicitly	to	prevent	problems	during	startup.  	If	your	host	doesn't	have	a	registered	DNS	name,	enter	its	IP	address	here. ServerName	www.example.com:80   	Deny	access	to	the	entirety	of	your	server's	filesystem.	You	must		explicitly permit	access	to	web	content	directories	in	other		 	blocks	below.     AllowOverride	none Require	all	denied     	Note	that	from	this	point	forward	you	must	specifically	allow		particular features	to	be	enabled	-	so	if	something's	not  working	as 	you	might	expect,	make	sure	that	you	have	specifically enabled	it 	below.    	DocumentRoot:	The	directory	out	of	which	you	will	serve	your		documents. By	default,	all	requests	are	taken	from	this  directory,	but 	symbolic	links	and	aliases	may	be	used	to	point	to	other locations.   locations.

AllowOverride	None 	Allow	open	access: Require	all	granted     	Further	relax	access	to	the	default	document	root:	<Directory " var www html">  	Possible	values	for	the	Options	directive	are	"None",	"All",		or	any combination	of: 	Indexes	Includes	FollowSymLinks	SymLinksifOwnerMatch	ExecCGI MultiViews  	Note	that	"MultiViews"	must	be	named	*explicitly*	--"Options	All" 	doesn't	give	it	to	you.  	The	Options	directive	is	both	complicated	and	important.	Please	see 	http:  httpd.apache.org docs 2.4 mod core.htmloptions		for	more information.  Options	Indexes	FollowSymLinks   	AllowOverride	controls	what	directives	may	be	placed	in  .htaccess	files. 	It	can	be	"All",	"None",	or	any	combination	of	the keywords: 	Options	FileInfo	AuthConfig	Limit  AllowOverride	None   AllowOverride	None   	Controls	who	can	get	stuff	from	this	server.	 Require	all	granted      	DirectoryIndex:	sets	the	file	that	Apache	will	serve	if	a	directory 	is	requested.    DirectoryIndex	index.html      	The	following	lines	prevent	.htaccess	and	.htpasswd	files	from	being 	viewed	by	Web	clients.    Require	all	denied     	ErrorLog:	The	location	of	the	error	log	file. 	If	you	do	not	specify	an	ErrorLog	directive	within	a    	container,	error	messages	relating	to	that	virtual	host	will	be		logged	here.	If you	*do*	define	an	error	logfile	for	a    	container,	that	host's	errors	will	be	logged	there	and	not	here.	 ErrorLog	"logs error_log"   	LogLevel:	Control	the	number	of	messages	logged	to	the	error_log.		Possible values	include:	debug,	info,	notice,	warn,	error,	crit,		alert,	emerg.  LogLevel	warn   LogLevel	warn      	The	following	directives	define	some	format	nicknames	for	use	with		a CustomLog	directive	 see	below .

If	you	do	not	define	any	access	logfiles	within	a   	container,	they	will	be	logged	here.	Contrariwise,	if you	*do* 	define	per- 	access	logfiles,	transactions	will	be		logged	therein and	*not*	in	this	file.  CustomLog	"logs access_log"	common    	If	you	prefer	a	logfile	with	access,	agent,	and	referer	information 	 Combined	Logfile	Format 	you	can	use	the	following	directive.

The	client		will	make	a new	request	for	the	document	at	its	new	location.		Example: 	Redirect	permanent	 foo	http:  www.example.com bar   	Alias:	Maps	web	paths	into	filesystem	paths	and	is	used	to		access	content that	does	not	live	under	the	DocumentRoot.		Example: 	Alias	 webpath	 full filesystem path  	If	you	include	a	trailing	 	on	 webpath	then	the	server	will		require	it	to	be present	in	the	URL.	You	will	also	likely		need	to	provide	a	 	section to	allow	access	to		the	filesystem	path.  	ScriptAlias:	This	controls	which	directories	contain  server	scripts. 	ScriptAliases	are	essentially	the	same	as	Aliases,	except	that		documents	in the	target	directory	are	treated	as  applications	and 	run	by	the	server	when	requested	rather	than	as	documents sent	to	the 	client.	The	same	rules	about	trailing	" "	apply	to ScriptAlias 	directives	as	to	Alias.  ScriptAlias	 cgi-bin 	" var www cgi-bin "     	" var www cgi-bin"	should	be	changed	to	whatever	your  ScriptAliased 	CGI	directory	exists,	if	you	have	that	configured.

AddType	application x-gzip	.tgz  	AddEncoding	allows	you	to	have	certain	browsers	uncompress 	information	on	the	fly.	Note:	Not	all	browsers	support	this.  AddEncoding	x-compress	.Z AddEncoding	x-gzip	.gz	.tgz  	If	the	AddEncoding	directives	above	are	commented-out,	then	you 	probably	should	define	those	extensions	to	indicate	media	types:  AddType	application x-compress	.Z AddType	application x-gzip	.gz	.tgz   	AddHandler	allows	you	to	map	certain	file	extensions	to  "handlers": 	actions	unrelated	to	filetype.	These	can	be	either	built into	the	server 	or	added	with	the	Action	directive	 see	below 	 	To	use	CGI	scripts	outside	of	ScriptAliased	directories:		 You	will	also	need to	add	"ExecCGI"	to	the	"Options" directive.

ServerRoot	" etc httpd"  This	directive	indicates	the	root	where	all	the	server’s	global	files	are	located. This	includes	all	the	configuration	files,	the	log	files,	and	the	error	files.  The	next	directive	is	theListen	directive,	and	it	specifies	the	TCP IP	port	that	the server	will	listen	on. Listen	12.34.56.78:80 Listen	80  The	Listen	directive	shown	earlier	specifies	that	port	80	should	be	used	as	the listening	port	on	the	default	IP	address. The	next	directive	specifies	where	the	necessary	global	modules	should	be loaded	from.  Include	conf.modules.d *.conf  This	Include	directive	specifies	the	location	of	the	configuration	files	that	will load	the	global	modules.	What	is	specified	here	is	a	subdirectory	off theServerRoot	directory.	Only	files	in	this	subdirectory	with	an	extension	of.conf   theServerRoot	directory.	Only	files	in	this	subdirectory	with	an	extension	of.conf will	be	loaded	and	thus	also	the	modules	actually	loaded	from	them.	There	are multiple	configuration	files	because	the	modules	are	divided	into	different categories	and	can	thus	be	included	or	excluded	easily.  The	next	directives	are	theUser	andGroup	directives. User	apache Group	apache  The	User	directive	specifies	what	userID	Apache	should	run	under,	and theGroup	directive	specifies	what	groupID	it	should	run	under.	While	this	may not	seem	important,	it	actually	is,	especially	when	running	more	than	one	server. Each	server	may	need	to	be	running	under	a	different	userID	and	groupID	to work	properly.	If	you	are	running	multiple	servers,	then	consider	moving	the userID	and	groupID	to	the	individual	server	configuration	files.  All	the	following	directives	set	up	the	values	used	by	the	“main”	server,	which responds	to	any	requests	that	aren’t	handled	by	a 	definition.	These values	also	provide	defaults	for	any 	containers	you	may	define later	in	the	file.  All	of	these	directives	may	appear	inside	 	containers,	in	which case	these	default	settings	will	be	overridden	for	the	virtual	host	being	defined.  The	next	directive	specifies	where	you	want	problems	with	your	server	to	be emailed. ServerAdmin	root@localhost  The	ServerAdmin	directive	should	be	changed	to	an	email	address	under	the server	administrator	that	has	the	authority	to	handle	problems	with	the	Apache server.  The	next	directive	specifies	the	name	known	to	the	DNS	server	used	by	the machine	running	the	Apache	server. ServerName	www.example.com:80  You	should	note	that	not	only	the	name	should	be	specified	but	also	the	listening port.	The	port	does	not	have	to	be	unique	if	you	are	running	multiple	servers	on the	same	TCP IP	address	and	port.	For	more	information	concerning	this	kind	of configuration,	you	should	refer	to	the	Apache	documentation.   The	next	section	is	extremely	important!    AllowOverride	none Require	all	denied     Do	not	modify	this	section	unless	you	know	exactly	what	you	are	doing.	My suggestion	is	to	never	modify	it.	This	protects	your	root	file	system	from snoopers	by	removing	read	access	from	all	Apache	users	 not	system	users 	to the	root	directory.	If	you	intend	to	modify	this	section,	you	should	consult	with your	security	team	first.  The	next	directive,	DocumentRoot,	specifies	the	root	of	all	the	files	on	your server,	or	at	least	most	of	them.	There	are	some	exceptions	that	we	will	run	into later.  DocumentRoot	" var www html"  You	can	point	the	DocumentRoot	directive	anywhere	you	want	on	your	file system,	but	it	is	suggested	that	it	should	always	be	local	within	the	root	file system	so	that	during	startup	of	the	server	this	location	will	always	be	visible.  The	next	section	relaxes	access	to	the	content	of	theDocumentRoot:    AllowOverride	None 	Allow	open	access: Require	all	granted     The	previous	DocumentRoot	directive	pointed	our	server	to	the	root	of	our document	file	system.	Now	we	have	to	relax	the	access	to	that	point	so	the	server can	have	access	to	the	files.	This	section	of	code	gives	all	access	rights	to	the server.  We	actually	need	additional	access	rights,	so	the	following	gives	us	those	rights: Options	Indexes	FollowSymLinks AllowOverride	None   AllowOverride	None  The	Options	directive	in	this	case	allows	a	listing	of	all	the	files	to	be	sent	to	the user	just	in	case	anindex.htmlfile	does	not	exist.	It	also	forces	the	server	to follow	symbolic	links	even	if	they	point	outside	the	DocumentRoot	tree.  The	next	directive	is	used	to	specify	the	name	of	the	file	that	will	be	fetched should	one	not	be	specified	by	the	user. DirectoryIndex	index.html In	this	case,	the	name	of	the	file	isindex.html. The	following	lines	prevent	the.htaccess	and.htpasswd	files	from	being	viewed by	clients:   Require	all	denied   The	following	directive	specifies	the	name	and	location	of	the	error	log: ErrorLog	"logs error_log" When	the	server	needs	to	log	an	error,	this	is	where	it	will	be	placed.	Next,	we want	to	at	least	control	what	errors	get	logged.  	Possible	values	include:	debug,	info,	notice,	warn,	error,	crit,		alert,	emerg.  LogLevel	warn  The	possible	values	here	aredebug,	info,	notice,	warn,	error,	crit,	alert,	and emerg	in	order	from	lowest	to	highest.	Only	the	level	you	specify	plus	higher levels	will	be	logged;	all	lower	levels	will	be	ignored.	The	next	section	contains several	directives	specifying	the	format	that	log	messages	will	appear	in:    The	formats	are	specified	in	C’ssprintf	format.	These	formats	are	relatively straightforward	and	easily	understood.	Also	specified	in	this	section	are	the name	and	location	of	the	access	log.	The	directives	in	this	section	are	executed only	if	the	corresponding	module	is	loaded	previously.  The	next	section	uses	the	Alias	module	to	further	alias	other	subdirectories.    This	module	created	fake	entries	in	the	Apache	document	directory	tree,	which can	be	referred	to	by	the	user.	An	example	of	this	is	the cgibin	subdirectory, which	can	hold	programs	to	be	executed	by	the	user’s	browser	to	produce	a   which	can	hold	programs	to	be	executed	by	the	user’s	browser	to	produce	a dynamic	HTML	page.	The	directives	in	this	section	are	executed	only	if	the corresponding	module	is	loaded	previously.  The	following	section	sets	the	characteristics	for	the cgi-bin	subdirectory:    The	directives	in	this	section	make	whatever	programs	are	within	the	 cgi-bin subdirectory	executable	and	readable	for	the	user	browser. The	next	section	adds	default	actions	for	certain	file	types	that	can	be	executed by	the	browser	if	it	is	supported	by	the	browser.     There	are	a	number	of	actions	based	on	file	type s 	specified	here.	The	directives in	this	section	are	executed	only	if	the	corresponding	module	is	loaded previously.  When	the	server	provides	output	to	the	browser,	we	need	a	default	character	set to	use	in	case	the	HTML	page	does	not	specify	one.  AddDefaultCharset	UTF-8 The	previous	directive	sets	the	UTF-8	character	set	as	the	default	character	set	to be	used	by	all	web	pages	when	no	character	set	is	explicitly	set	within	the	web page.  The	next	section	gives	hints	to	the	server	about	various	file	types:	<IfModule mime_magic_module>  The	mod_mime_magic	module	allows	the	server	to	use	various	hints	from	the contents	of	the	file	itself	to	determine	its	type.	The	directives	in	this	section	are executed	only	if	the	corresponding	module	is	loaded	previously.  The	next	section	enables	the	operating	system	to	return	a	file	to	the	client: EnableMMAP	off EnableSendfile	on  On	systems	that	support	it,	memory-mapping	or	the	sendfile	syscall	may	be	used to	return	files	to	the	browser.	This	usually	improves	server	performance	but	must be	turned	off	when	serving	from	a	networked-mounted	file	system	or	if	support for	these	functions	is	otherwise	broken	on	your	system.   Lastly,	additional	configuration	files	may	be	included. IncludeOptional	conf.d *.conf  If	the	Apache	server	is	supporting	one	or	more	virtual	machines,	then	this location	will	usually	contain	a	file	for	the	configuration	of	each	virtual	machine. All	the	directives	usually	contained	in	one	of	these	files	have	been	shown previously,	although	you	may	find	they	contain	additional	directives	to	support functions	needed	by	one	or	more	virtual	machines.  As	you	can	see,	Apache	supports	many	directives	to	configure	the	server,	many of	which	have	not	been	discussed	in	this	chapter.	A	really	good	Apache reference	manual	is	required	to	make	full	use	of	the	power	of	the	server.	Later	in this	book	we	look	at	some	additional	directives	for	use	in	our	discussion	of dynamic	web	pages.  Organizing	Your	Web	Server  This	topic,	while	at	first	glance	appears	to	be	simple,	is	actually	fraught	with potential	problems	of	your	own	making.	It	is	so	easy	to	fall	into	traps	when organizing	a	website	that	this	topic	deserves	special	treatment.  The	problems	that	you	can	create	for	yourself	all	revolve	around	security.	In	the previous	section,	the	default	configuration	points	the	DocumentRootto	a	location that	in	the	beginning	looks	pretty	safe	because	it	is	mostly	empty.	The	problem comes	when	you	point	theDocumentRoot	to	some	other	spot	on	your	file	system. Apache	has	no	idea	if	you	have	just	created	a	problem	for	yourself.  We	need	to	examine	the	potential	problems	that	you	can	make	for	yourself	both now	and	in	the	future.  Operating	System	Links  Operating	system	links	 created	with	the	ln	command 	create	a	shortcut	to another	part	of	the	file	system.	While	this	may	seem	like	a	nice	way	to	build certain	parts	of	your	file	system	for	use	by	Apache,	you	should	be	extremely careful	when	doing	so.	Not	only	can	links	bring	in	some	features	you	would otherwise	have	to	duplicate,	but	they	can	also	bring	in	unintended	files	that either	might	be	sensitive	from	a	security	point	of	view	or	not	readable	by	the Apache	user	 that	can	be	good	or	bad	depending	on	the	circumstances .   Remember	also	that	when	you	bring	other	parts	of	the	file	system	into	Apache’s root,	you	may	or	may	not	have	administrative	privileges	on	that	part	of	the	file system.	This	means	others	can	make	changes	to	the	file	system	that	might	have an	adverse	impact	on	your	expectations.  Ownership	of	files	being	brought	into	Apache’s	purview	can	also	be	a	problem. Apache	may	not	be	able	to	read	these	files,	so	that	needs	to	be	evaluated	for	your circumstances.	Also,	ownership	of	these	files	can	change	at	any	time,	and	that may	have	a	negative	impact	on	the	usability	of	your	site.  Lastly,	new	files	may	be	added	at	any	time,	and	older	files	may	be	deleted	at	any time.	You	may	or	may	not	get	notifications	about	these	additions deletions,	but they	could	have	impacts	on	your	website	and	need	to	be	evaluatedbefore	they occur,	not	after.  Apache	Directives  The	Apache	directives	Alias	and	ScriptAlias	are	similar	to	the	operating	system ln	command	in	that	they	bring	in	other	parts	of	the	local	file	system	to	the	file system	created	by	Apache.	The	only	real	difference	is	that	theAlias andScriptAlias	directives	are	logical	and	not	physical;	i.e.,	only	Apache	can	see them,	and	they	do	not	really	exist	in	the	file	system.	But	from	the	perspective	of the	web	administrator,	they	have	the	same	potential	problems	as	real	links.	All the	problems	listed	in	the	previous	section	also	apply	to	these	directives.  Summary  This	chapter	introduced	you	to	web	servers	in	general	with	specific	focus	on	the Apache	web	server.	I	also	introduced	you	to	some	web	server	concepts	as	well as	some	topics	specific	to	Apache.  I	introduced	you	to	Apache’s	configuration	file	and	described	the	required	and optional	features	available	to	the	administrator	when	configuring	Apache.  Lastly,	I	introduced	you	to	some	potential	problems	you	may	run	into	when organizing	your	website’s	file	system.  CHAPTER	2   HTML	Pages	and	CSS  This	chapter	is	all	about	Hypertext	Markup	Language	 HTML 	and	the corresponding	Cascading	Style	Sheets	 CSS 	language.	This	is	just	an introduction,	and	it	is	highly	recommended	that	you	obtain	specialized references	on	both	of	these	topics	to	gain	a	complete	understanding	of	how	these languages	work	together	to	present	information	to	the	user.  The	HTML	language	has	a	long	history	going	back	to	the	1970s.	It	is	what	is known	as	a	tag	language.	It	uses	special	tags	within	the	text	within	your	HTML page	to	identify	different	kinds	of	text.	There	are	tags	to	identify	paragraphs, numbered	lists,	definition	lists,	headings,	tables,	forms,	images,	and	many	other parts.  The	CSS	language	actually	comes	in	two	forms.	The	first	form	of	the	language	is attached	to	HTML	tags	as	attributes.	The	second	form	of	the	language	is	as	a stand-alone	document	that	completely	describes	how	the	document	is	to	be formatted.	We	will	describe	this	in	more	detail	later	in	this	chapter. HTML	Tags  HTML	tags	have	a	long	history	going	back	to	the	Generalized	Markup	Language  GML 	tag	system	invented	by	IBM.	GML	was	the	result	of	modernizing	an earlier	language	that	described	both	the	formatting	of	a	document	and	the	style of	the	document.	In	the	early	days	of	printing	hardware,	there	was	not	much differentiation	between	the	printer	and	the	formatting	of	a	document.	But	as	the number	and	variations	of	printers	increased,	the	need	to	separate	the	style	of	the document	from	identifying	the	elements	of	a	document	increased	dramatically. By	the	beginning	of	the	1980s,	there	were	hundreds	of	different	kinds	of	printers including	character-,	line-,	and	laser-based.	This	increase	really	exploded	during the	1980s.  This	explosion	of	printing	hardware	required	a	rethinking	of	content	versus	style. In	this	way,	a	style	can	be	tuned	to	an	output	device	while	the	content	remains unchanged.	The	IBM	GML	language	evolved	during	the	1980s	into	the Standardized	General	Markup	Language	 SGML 	tag	language.	This	was	a relatively	short-lived	standard	as	it	was	hard	to	learn,	extensive,	and	practically unusable	to	write	documents	of	any	kind.	But	it	did	become	the	basis	for	two   unusable	to	write	documents	of	any	kind.	But	it	did	become	the	basis	for	two child	languages:	HTML	and	XML.	These	two	languages	used	many	of	the concepts	pioneered	in	SGML	and	left	out	anything	not	really	needed	for	their purpose.  HTML	has	gone	through	several	revisions	since	its	first	release	in	the	early 1990s.	Currently,	we	are	at	version	5.0	of	HTML.	This	version	has	taken	on	a few	characteristics	of	the	XML	language	and	added	comprehensive	use	of	CSS to	form	a	language	that	is	easy	to	use	and	code	for	even	neophytes.	The	number of	tags	has	been	kept	to	a	minimum,	and	they	are	easy	to	remember.	There	are any	number	of	reference	books	to	help	you	learn	to	code	your	documents	with HTML	and	CSS,	but	they	have	a	limitation	in	that	they	usually	show	you	how	to write	relatively	simple	HTML	pages.	What	they	do	not	concentrate	on	is	how	to write	dynamic	web	pages,	i.e.,	pages	that	can	change	based	on	input	from	the user	or	the	data	itself.  Although	CSS	is	undeniably	integral	to	HTML,	this	book	will	only	cover	the basics	of	that	integration.	Any	CSS	reference	will	cover	the	same	material	in more	detail,	and	I	will	leave	that	to	you	to	learn.  Document	and	Metadata	Tags  Table	2-1	summarizes	the	document	and	metadata	tags.	These	tags	are	used	to describe	the	superstructure	of	your	document’s	HTML	page.	These	tags	provide information	to	the	browser	concerning	the	document,	define	the	styles,	and specify	any	scripts	used	by	the	document.  Many	of	the	descriptions	were	taken	from	other	sources	on	the	Web	and elsewhere.	Any	mistakes	in	the	text	are	mine	alone. Table	2-1.

I	will	not	go	into	any	depth in	explaining	how	to	use	these	elements;	I	will	just	present	them	and	follow	up in	later	chapters	with	some	examples.  CSS	selectors	are	used	to	group	styles	and	designate	which	style	is	to	be	used	for different	HTML	tags.	Properties	are	really	just	styles	to	be	applied	to	an	HTML tag.  To	understand	the	terminology	used	in	the	tag	names	of	CSS,	the	following diagrams	show	how	the	elements	all	relate	to	each	other.  Figure	2-1	is	a	simple	model	for	a	tag	 or	element	as	it	is	more	formally	known . Each	tag	has	a	number	of	surrounding	areas	that	help	to	set	off	the	tag	from	other tags.   Figure	2-1.

This	is	covered	before	any	examples	of	HTML	and	CSS pages	are	shown	so	that	you	will	have	some	idea	about	how	to	organize	the	data that	will	later	be	presented	to	you.  Normally	a	layout	of	the	directories	for	your	website	will	look	something	like Listing 2-1 . Listing	2-1.	This	Is	the	Normal	Structure	for	Website	Directories  www  cgi-bin  docroot   css  html-lib  images    images  js   wsgi   This	structure	does	one	thing	for	you:	it	places	the	cgi-bin	and	wsgi	directories outside	of	thedocroot	directory.	This	has	advantages	because	the	contents	of thecgi-bin	andwsgi	directories	should	never	be	displayed	to	the	user	as	that invites	possible	tampering	with	the	executable	files	located	in	those	directories.  The	css	directory	is	where	you	will	store	your	style	sheets,	and	the	html-lib directory	is	where	you	will	store	your	HTML	fragments.	While	thecss	directory is	straightforward,	thehtml-lib	directory	may	not	be	familiar	to	you.	Later,	we will	be	building	HTML	pages	dynamically	from	fragments	of	pages	stored	in thehtml-lib	directory.	If	this	directory	gets	very	large,	you	may	want	to	subdivide it	further	so	that	it	is	easier	to	maintain.  The	images	directory	is	where	you	will	store	all	the	static	images	that	will	be displayed	on	your	HTML	pages.	At	this	point	we	do	not	differentiate	between the	different	types	of	images	 JPEG,	PNG,	GIF,	etc. ,	but	you	may	want	to further	subdivide	the	images	into	groups	within	theimages	directory.  The	js	directory	is	where	you	keep	your	shared	JavaScript	programs.	We	will	not use	this	directory	in	this	book	because	we	will	not	have	a	lot	of	JavaScript	in	our examples.	Instead,	what	we	need	we	will	code	directly	in	the	HTML	files.  Now	that	you	have	some	idea	how	to	organize	and	store	the	files	we	will	create in	this	book,	let’s	move	on	to	some	really	simple	HTML	and	CSS	examples.  Simple	HTML	and	CSS	Pages  In	this	section,	you	will	start	coding	HTML	and	CSS	pages.	We	will	start	with	a simple	example	and	continually	extend	it	to	become	a	full-fledged	working	web page.  To	get	started,	we	will	code	an	HTML	page	and	a	CSS	page	that	contains nothing	but	a	top	header.	This	should	provide	you	with	enough	information about	how	all	this	hooks	together.	We	will	code	the	HTML	page	in	version	5, which	will	be	used	throughout	this	book.	The	CCS	sheet	will	be	coded	in	version 4,	which	has	been	around	for	a	while.   Listing 2-2	shows	the	code	for	the	HTML	page,	and	Listing	2-3	shows	the	CSS	page. Figure	2-3 shows	the	output	in	the	Firefox	browser. Listing	2-2.

The	HTML	page	displayed	in	Firefox  This	is	a	simple	example,	but	let’s	go	over	the	HTML	page	and	the	CSS	sheet separately. The	HTML	page	starts	on	line	1	by	declaring	this	is	an	HTML	version	5.0	page. The	next	line	starts	the	HTML	block. The 	tag	contains	the 	tag,	which	is	displayed	in	the	top	bar	of	the Firefox	window.	It	also	contains	a 	tag,	which	describes	the	HTML	page and	some	defaults	for	the	browser	to	use.	The	next	tag	is	the tag,	which points	to	the	location	of	our	CSS	style	sheet. Next	comes	the	actual	body	of	the	page	contained	within	the 	tag.	This tag	has	an	id	of	body,	which	corresponds	to	thebody	element	on	the	CSS document.	Thebody	element	specifies	the	default	styling	for	everything between	the 	and	 	tags.	The	style	has	two	specifications:	one	for the	default	positions	of	all	the	containing	blocks	 which	isrelative	in	this	case  and	one	for	the	default	text	alignment	 which	isleft	in	this	case .	This	means every	block	will	have	these	two	settings	by	default	unless	it	is	specifically overridden	by	the	contained	block	specification. The	first	block,	or ,	within	the 	tag	is	a	simple	container for	two	other 	tags.	This	style	for	this	tag	points	to	theheader	style	and	has   for	two	other 	tags.	This	style	for	this	tag	points	to	theheader	style	and	has some	simple	but	needed	specifications.	The	position	is	relative,	which	means that	this	container	is	relative	to	all	other	containers	at	the	same	level	 direct children	of	the 	level .	Padding	is	specified	for	the	top,	bottom,	left,	and right	sides	of	the	elements.	The	relative	origin	for	the	element	is	specified	as	0px for	the	upper	left.	The	height	is	set	at	165px,	and	the	width	is	the	entire	width	of its	container. The	next 	within	the 	contains	an	image and	some	text.	We	specify	a	specific	width	and	height	for	the	container	so	that we	can	contain	the	image	and	the	text	and	match	the	height	of	the	next	container. We	also	float	the	container	to	the	left	to	ensure	its	horizontal	position.	Next,	we center	the	image	and	text	within	the	container	as	well	as	vertically	within	the container.	We	also	specify	some	padding	and	the	font	size	for	all	text.	Last,	we specify	a	border	for	the	container.	Normally	we	would	exclude	this	item,	but	we include	it	here	to	demonstrate	how	our	containers	align. The	last 	container	will	display	a	title	for	the	page. Theheader-right	style	specifies	that	the	width	should	take	up	all	the	remaining horizontal	space	within	the .	Theheight	of	the	container	should match	the	height	specified	in	the	 	so	that	both	containers have	the	same	height.	Theline-height	is	adjusted	to	that	the	text	is	centered vertically.	The	font-size	is	enlarged	so	that	it	is	visually	pleasing.	If	the	text overflows	on	the	right	side,	theoverflow-x	specification	simply	hides	the overflow	instead	of	forcing	the	text	to	wrap.	We	add	a	littlepadding	just	to	make sure	we	have	a	pleasing	look.	Lastly,	we	have	our	optional	border	specification just	to	demonstrate	that	all	the	containers	line	up	properly. At	the	top	of	the	CSS	page	are	some	global	values	that	can	be	used	throughout the	rest	of	the	CSS	page.	These	are	not	likely	to	change	in	subsequent	parts	of the	CSS	so	are	placed	at	the	top	of	the	CSS	page	so	they	can	be	used	by	all	of	the other	styles. As	we	can	see,	we	have	a	nice	header	that	can	be	reused	for	many	of	our documents.	We	will	demonstrate	how	this	is	done	later	in	the	book. This	simple	example	demonstrates	many	of	the	concepts	we	will	continue	to make	use	of	throughout	this	book.

The	complete	HTML	page	displayed	in	Firefox  Instead	of	going	over	the	listings	line	by	line,	I	will	just	hit	the	high	points.   Instead	of	going	over	the	listings	line	by	line,	I	will	just	hit	the	high	points. The	first	point	that	really	needs	some	explanation	is	in	thecontentright	section	of the	CSS	page.	Theoverflow-x	element	has	a	property	ofhidden.	This	is	necessary to	keep	the	division	from	wrapping	around	to	the	left	and	under	thecontent-left section.	It	keeps	all	the	content	in	that	section	in	a	single	straight	column.	The same	is	true	for	thepagemenuright	section	except	that	in	this	case	theoverflow-x property	hides	any	menu	entries	that	overflow	to	the	right	instead	of	wrapping the	text.	This	will	happen	only	when	the	browser	window	is	sized	too	small	to	fit all	the	menu	items. We	also	added	some	color	to	help	the	separation	of	the	left	content	from	the right	content.	This	also	adds	some	interest	to	the	page. Last,	we	kept	the	borders	for	each	division	so	you	can	see	how	the	divisions relate	to	each	other. This	is	how	to	properly	build	HTML	pages	with	CSS.	If	you	see	any	HTML	tags or	CSS	elements	you	do	not	understand,	you	should	refer	to	a	more	complete reference	for	HTML CSS.	I	provided	you	with	a	web	page	complex	enough	that we	can	use	it	in	the	following	section	to	explain	how	to	divide	an	HTML	page into	parts	that	can	be	stored	and	worked	with	separately.  Creating	a	Library	of	HTML	Page	Segments  Splitting	a	page	into	segments	is	actually	easy	if	you	take	the	right	precautions. You	should	always	try	to	split	an	HTML	page	at	major 	segments.	This usually	has	the	added	benefit	of	splitting	the	page	at	major	topic	divisions,	thus making	the	segmenting	of	the	page	easier	from	an	author’s	point	of	view.  The	following	are	some	HTML	page	segments	created	from	Listing 2-4.	Listing	2-6 shows	the	top	of	the	HTML	page,	or	theheader	as	we	called	it. Listing	2-6.	The	HTML	Page	Header            <img	src=" images Dora.jpg" alt="Holmes4"	 >   image	by	W.David	Ashley           Example2-3       You	should	note	that	we	did	not	include	the	beginning	of	the	HTML	file	in	this segment.	That	was	done	on	purpose	as	we	may	end	up	using	this	segment	in multiple	HTML	pages	and	they	may	have	different	content	and	thus	require different	headers.	Listing	2-7	shows	the	HTML	page	menu	bar.  Listing	2-7.	The	HTML	Page	Menu	Bar         Sample	Title        &nbsp;Menu1&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;Menu2&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;Menu3&nbsp; &nbsp;     Obviously,	we	want	this	to	be	reusable	by	authors	for	multiple	page	designs,	so we	keep	it	separate	for	easier	coding.	Listing	2-8	shows	the	major	content	for	the page.  Listing	2-8.	The	HTML	Page	Contents       	    This	is	just	some	dummy	content	for	the	left	column.	Normally	this	would be	replaced	by	either	hyper	links	or	some	other	selection	techniques.               This	is	just	some	dummy	content.	This	could	be	replaced	by	any	combination of	text	and	controls.  x x x x x x x x	 x x x        Both	sides	of	the	page	are	kept	together	here	because	if	the	right-side	content changes,	then	the	left	side	will	need	to	change	as	well.	Listing 2-9 shows	the	footer	for	the	HTML	page. Listing	2-9.	The	HTML	Page	Footer	       <img	alt="Powered	by	Apache" src=" images apache_pb.png"	 >  &169;	Copyright	2010-2020 W.	David	Ashley.	All	rights	reserved.	     There	is	a	reason	this	is	broken	into	a	segment.	The	2020	date	could	be programmatically	changed	easily	if	the	year	changed.	Otherwise,	you	would have	to	change	the	year	manually	every	time	a	new	year	rolled	around.	We	will show	you	how	to	do	this	in	the	next	chapter.  Note	It	is	important	to	note	here	that	we	have	been	careful	to	segment	each	code fragment	such	that	we	do	not	cut	it	at	a	point	that	would	also	cut	the	Css	item.	If you	did	this,	it	could	create	problems	later	in	the	life	of	the	document	when	it	is edited.  Obviously,	there	are	many	things	that	will	need	to	be	changed	programmatically for	all	the	segments	shown	previously.	This	can	easily	be	accomplished	via	some Python	programming.	The	next	chapter	will	show	you	how	to	do	that.   Summary  This	chapter	gave	you	a	look	at	the	HTML	tags	and	CSS	items	you	will	be dealing	with	to	create	and	maintain	dynamic	pages.	You	also	saw	a	good directory	layout	to	use	on	your	web	server.	Last,	you	saw	how	to	segment	your web	pages	so	that	they	can	be	utilized	and	reused	by	your	web	page	authors.  In	the	next	chapter,	I	will	show	you	how	to	build	dynamic	web	pages	using	the CGI	mechanism	offered	by	almost	all	web	servers.  CHAPTER	3 Using	CGI	and	Python  This	chapter	is	all	about	how	to	write	programs	that	will	be	stored	in	the	cgi-bin directory.	This	is	a	special	directory	because	users	can	execute	programs	stored in	this	directory.	You	need	to	be	extra	careful	about	the	programs	you	write because	they	can	be	abused	by	the	users	or	anyone	else	with	access	to	your	web server.  Programs	stored	in	the	cgi-bin	directory	can	be	of	any	type	available	that	are executable	on	the	server.	This	means	they	can	be	written	in	C,	Python,	Perl,	a command-line	shell,	or	any	other	language	supported	on	the	server.	In	this	book, we	will	be	discussing	how	to	write	Python	scripts	that	are	stored	in	thecgi- bindirectory.  Most	web	servers	come	with	cgi-bin	installed.	You	do	not	need	to	do	anything except	place	your	programs	in	the	directory	with	the	correct	permissions.	If	you have	to	create	thecgi-bin	subdirectory,	please	refer	to	Listing	1-1	for	an explanation	of	what	must	be	configured	to	make	it	work	properly.  In	this	chapter,	I	will	show	a	few	examples	ofcgi-binprograms	as	well	as	expand on	some	of	the	concepts	we	used	in	the	previous	chapter. Your	First	cgi-bin	Program  In	this	section,	I	will	show	you	a	simple	but	useful	Python	cgi-bin	program. When	executed,	this	program	will	display	all	the	environment	variables	passed   When	executed,	this	program	will	display	all	the	environment	variables	passed to	the	program	on	a	standard	web	page.  The	program,	shown	in	Listing	3-1,	illustrates	how	to	write	acgi-bin	web program.	The	first	thing	to	know	about	this	program	is	that	all	standard	output	is routed	back	to	the	user’s	web	browser.	The	browser	expects	it	in	a	specific format,	and	this	program	obeys	those	rules.  The	first	item	sent	back	specifies	the	type	of	content	that	is	being	returned.	In this	case,	it	is	HTML.	This	is	followed	by	two	carriage	returns	 linefeeds , sending	a	line	of	text	with	the	type	followed	by	a	blank	line.  Next	come	the	contents	of	the	HTML	page.	In	this	case,	we	have	supplied	an extremely	simple	HTML	page.	We	supply	the	web	page	prefix	HTML	tags	and then	set	the	font	for	a	title.  Then	comes	the	heart	of	the	page.	The	loop	code	runs	through	the	environment data	and	outputs	the	name	and	value	of	each	environment	variable.  Last,	we	close	the	HTML	body	and	the	HTML	page. There	are	some	things	to	note	here.	You	may	think	the	environment	is incomplete	because	it	does	not	contain	some	expected	values.	But	this	output	is actually	correct.	In	the	case	ofcgi-binprograms,	the	environment	is	completely artificial	because	it	is	created	by	the	web	server	and	is	not	inherited	from	the web	server’s	environment.	This	is	completely	normal	because	it	helps	to	keep private	and	secure	information	out	of	the	hands	of	roguecgi-bin	programs. This	program	outputs	a	lot	of	useful	information,	and	it	shows	how	the environment	can	be	used	to	write	truly	portable	programs.	It	is	handy	to	keep this	program	around	when	you	are	trying	to	make	use	of	information	from	the environment.  Listing	3-1.	A	Useful	cgi-bin	Program ! usr bin python import	os  print "Content-type:	text html\r\n\r\n"  print "   "  print " Environment  "  for	param	in	os.environ.keys  :  line	=	" %s :	%s "	%	 param,	os.environ[param] 	print line    line	=	" %s :	%s "	%	 param,	os.environ[param] 	print line  print "  "   Listing	3-1	outputs	the	code	in	Figure	3-1	when	run.	Note	that	there	is	some	line wrapping	in	this	figure. The	bold	type	names	are	the	environment	variable	names,	and	their corresponding	values	are	presented	after	the	names.	Again,	note	that	some	of	the values	are	wrapped	so	they	would	fit	in	the	figure.    Figure	3-1.	Output	of	the	useful	cgi-bin	program  Note	that	all	cgi-binprograms	when	run	from	this	directory	will	have	this	current directory,CONTEXT_DOCUMENT_ROOT,	even	if	you	came	from	a	different web	page.  The	next	item	is	the	DOCUMENT_ROOT	environment	variable.	This	variable points	you	to	the	root	directory	for	the	website.	We	will	need	this	variable	later when	we	want	to	locate	thehtml_lib	directory	so	we	can	find	our	HTML segments.  Although	it	is	currently	blank,	the	QUERY_STRING	environment	variable	is important	to	CGI	programs.	It	will	contain	everything	after	theREQUEST_ URIfrom	the	command	line.	Many	CGI	programs	use	this	information	as	one	or more	parameters	to	be	passed	to	the	program.	In	the	case	of	the	envvar.py program,	we	did	not	pass	anyQUERY_STRING	information;	thus,	it	is	blank.  For	those	of	you	working	with	multiple	languages,	the	HTTP_ACCEPT_ LANGUAGE	environment	variable	shows	what	languages	the	web	server	will accept.	Only	the	languages	listed	will	be	available	to	be	processed	by	the	web server.	TheHTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE	directive	works	in	conjunction	with the	LanguagePriority	directive	to	determine	what	language	will	be	used	when Apache	needs	to	create	an	HTML	page	to	send	to	the	user.  There	are	still	lots	of	environment	variables	left,	but	they	are	not	as	important	for our	purposes	as	the	ones	detailed.	They	may	or	may	not	be	useful	in	your environment,	but	they	are	always	available	for	every	request.  CGI	Program	Strategy  This	section	will	outline	the	strategy	for	our	CGI	programs.	Basically,	there	are five	steps	to	each	CGI	program	we	will	develop. 1.	Fetch	the	HTML	parts	that	will	be	used	for	your page. 2.	Create	the	template	version	of	the	page. 3.	Create	a	Python	dictionary	with	the	values	to	be substituted	into	the	page	template. 4.	Substitute	the	dictionary	values	into	the	template	to	create	the	HTML	page. 5.	Send	the	completed	HTML	page	to	the	user.   While	this	may	look	like	a	long	process,	it	will	become	easier	with	every	page you	create.	It	will	also	be	easy	to	maintain	the	dynamic	pages	as	each	part	of	the page	is	handled	separately	by	the	Python	program.  The	substitution	process	is	handled	by	using	the	Python	Template	class	from thestring	module.	Using	this	class	makes	creating	the	content	for	the	page	really easy.	Each	substitutable	part	of	the	page	will	be	contained	in	a	Python dictionary,	and	then	that	will	be	substituted	into	the	template	to	create	the completed	HTML	page	in	a	single	step.  Setting	Up	the	html_lib	Parts  We	are	going	to	use	the	HTML	page	created	in	Chapter	2	as	the	basis	for	our dynamic	CGI	page.	But	we	will	need	to	make	some	adjustments	to accommodate	the	Python	substitution	process	we	plan	to	use.	First,	we	will	make some	simple	changes	to	thehtml_lib	pieces	we	created	earlier.	Listing	3-2	shows the	HTML	for	the	header,	Listing	3-3	shows	the	HTML	for	the	menu,	Listing	3- 4	shows	the	content,	and	Listing	3-5	shows	the	HTML	for	the	footer.  Listing	3-2.

The	only	difference	between	these	files	and	the	ones	from	Chapter	2	are the$variable	terms	in	each	part.	The	variables	mark	the	spots	in	each	part	where a	substitution	will	take	place.	The	variable	name	will	correspond	to	an	entry	in	a Python	dictionary,	which	will	then	be	substituted	into	the	template.  This	is	all	we	have	to	do	to	a	part	to	get	it	ready	to	be	used	by	the	Python program.	These	parts	are	now	ready	to	be	used	in	many	kinds	of	pages	that	use our	standard	web	page	design.  A	Portable	and	Maintainable	CGI	Program   Listing 3-6 is	our	first	attempt	to	write	a	truly	portable	and	efficient	CGI	program	that	is easy	to	create	and	easy	to	maintain. Listing	3-6.	Our	First	CGI	Program ! usr bin python3 import	os,	time,	string  page_top	=	"""Content-type:text html\r\n\r\n         $title          """ page_bottom	=	"""   """ 	get	the	document	base	for	the	html_lib	directory	html_lib_path	= os.getenv 'DOCUMENT_ROOT' 	+	' html_lib '  	get	the	page	header f	=	open html_lib_path	+	'example3-1.html',	'r' 	page_header	=	f.read   f.close    	get	the	page	menu	bar f	=	open html_lib_path	+	'example3-2.html',	'r' 	page_menu_bar	=	f.read   f.close    	get	the	content f	=	open html_lib_path	+	'example3-3.html',	'r' 	page_content	=	f.read  	f.close    	get	the	footer f	=	open html_lib_path	+	'example3-4.html',	'r'  page_footer	=	f.read   f.close    	create	the	page	template   	create	the	page	template page_template	=	string.Template page_top	+	page_header	+	page_menu_bar	+ page_content	+	page_footer	+ page_bottom   	create	the	substitutable	content pagedict	=	dict   pagedict['title']	=	'My	Title' pagedict['titleleft']	=	'My	Left	Title' pagedict['main_menu']	=	' &nbsp;Home&nbsp;   &nbsp;'	+	\ ' &nbsp;Menu2&nbsp;	 &nbsp;'	+	\ ' &nbsp;Menu3&nbsp;	 &nbsp;'  pagedict['content_left']	=	'Line	1 '	+	\ 'Line	2 '	+	\ 'Line	3 '	+	\ 'Line	4 '  pagedict['content_right']	=	""" Welcome  Welcome	to	the	<a href=' '	target='_top'>	Dummy  web	site.   x x x x x	 x x  """ asctime	=	time.asctime   parts	=	asctime.split   pagedict['year']	=	parts[4]  	make	the	substitutions html	=	page_template.substitute pagedict  	print	the	substituted	lines print html   Listing	3-6	is	our	first	CGI	program	that	encompasses	all	of	our	desired	designs, and	it	includes	all	of	the	strategies	we	described	earlier.	As	you	can	see,	the Python	script	is	both	short	and	easily	understood.  The	script	starts	by	defining	the	prefix	and	suffix	HTML	code.	The	reason	this	is   done	in	the	script	and	not	in	an	HTML	part	file	is	that	you	may	have	changes that	need	to	be	made,	especially	to	the	prefix	data.	So,	it	is	better	that	it	be	stored here.  Next,	we	define	the	string	to	contain	the	html_lib	files. Now	we	can	fetch	each	one	of	the	HTML	parts	and	store	them	temporarily. After	fetching	the	HTML	parts	and	setting	the	substitutable	variables,	we concatenate	all	the	pieces	together	and	turn	it	into	a	template. Next,	we	define	all	the	entities	we	need	to	substitute.	This	will	include	all	of	the entities	throughout	the	entire	template.	If	you	leave	any	entities	undefined,	an error	will	be	thrown	by	Python. Finally,	we	substitute	all	the	entities	into	an	HTML	variable.	Then	we	print	the variable,	which	sends	it	to	STDOUT.	This	in	turn	is	redirected	to	the	TCP IP port	connected	to	the	client	browser. That	is	all	there	is	to	it.	Of	course,	this	is	just	a	small	example	page.	Your	pages will	have	much	more	content	to	assign	to	thecontent_left	and	content_right dictionary	entries.	There	are	some	different	ways	to	perform	this	assignment.	If the	content	is	static,	you	may	assign	all	the	content	in	the	Python	program,	or you	could	store	it	in	an	HTML	part	file	and	bring	it	in	at	runtime.	If	you	content is	variable,	then	you	might	choose	to	perform	all	the	assignments	in	the	script	or use	a	mixed	approach.	All	these	methods	are	viable	and	could	be	used	as	your circumstances	dictate. Figure	3-2	shows	the	output	of	this	Python	script	in	a	browser.   Figure	3-2.	Output	from	Listing	3-6  As	you	can	see,	all	our	substitutions	were	used	for	a	template	to	form	a	full	and correct	HTML	page.	The	page	is	still	just	a	short	example,	but	it	has	all	our desired	design	elements.	There	are	some	nice	touches	that	should	be	noted.  The	end	date	in	the	copyright	notice	is	completely	dynamic.	You	will	never	have to	edit	the	page	to	modify	the	copyright	date	as	it	is	updated	in	the	Python	script.  There	are	two	titles	that	appear	in	three	places.	The	first	is	the	main	title,	which appears	at	the	top	of	the	browser	window	and	at	the	top	of	the	HTML	page.	The   appears	at	the	top	of	the	browser	window	and	at	the	top	of	the	HTML	page.	The second	title	appears	on	the	left	side	of	the	menu	bat	in	the	HTML	page.	This	title will	probably	be	different	than	the	main	title	and	different	for	many	types	of pages.  Of	course,	you	will	have	your	own	menu	entries	for	your	website	on	the	page. This	is	easily	changed	in	the	script. The	content	in	thecontent_left	element	can	be	anything	that	makes	sense	for	the page.	Later	we	will	show	an	example	of	what	can	be	done	with	it. Thecontent_right	element	can	have	any	content	that	you	want,	but	it	should	be the	main	content	for	the	page. This	might	be	a	good	time	to	discuss	the	picture	in	the	upper	left	of	the	page.	We have	included	this	one	because	it	is	one	of	my	favorites.	The	dog’s	name	is Dora,	and	she	passed	away	in	late	2016.	She	was	a	certified	therapy	dog	and made	more	than	600	visits	to	nursing	homes,	assisted	living	centers,	hospitals, colleges,	and	special	events.	She	went	everywhere	I	could	take	her,	and	she loved	people.	But	in	this	case,	she	is	just	a	placeholder	for	your	own	logo, picture,	or	whatever	you	want	to	post	in	this	position	to	represent	your	site. At	this	point,	we	have	reached	a	junction	that	will	require	you	to	make	some decisions	that	will	have	long-term	impacts	on	your	site.	We	have	four	parts	of our	web	page	that	are	really	dynamic:	the	left	title,	the	menu	options,	the	left- side	content,	and	the	right-side	content.	For	a	simple	page,	it	may	be	best	to provide	the	content	in	the	Python	script.	But	for	other	pages	you	may	want	to provide	some	other	alternative	skeletons	for	these	areas	that	are	stored	in thehtml_lib	directory.	The	point	I	am	making	is	that	the	system	we	have designed	is	flexible	enough	to	accommodate	your	choices	without	forcing	you into	my	preconceived	ideas	for	how	to	set	up	your	site.  More	Partial	HTML	Skeletons  This	section	will	show	you	some	ideas	about	how	to	set	up	some	content	HTML skeletons.	Many	of	these	skeletons	are	cooperative;	in	other	words,	both	content areas	are	cooperating	with	each	other.	For	instance,	we	may	have	a	set	of selections	in	the	left	content	area	that	are	hyperlinks	to	locations	in	the	right content	area.	The	selections	in	the	left	side	might	also	require	modifications	to the	right	content	area,	and	this	in	turn	might	require	you	to	create	some JavaScript	to	manage	the	changes	dynamically.	But	let’s	start	with	a	simple	case first.   Hyperlink	HTML	Skeletons  Hyperlink	skeletons	are	relatively	easy	to	implement	and	manage.	The hyperlinks	will	appear	on	the	left	side,	and	the	destination	will	appear	on	the right	side.	If	the	content	on	the	right	side	is	large	enough,	it	will	cause	the	page to	scroll	to	that	portion	of	the	content.  Our	first	example	will	be	of	some	static	data	stored	in	an	expanded	HTML fragment	 see	Listing	3-7 .	We	will	be	making	a	change	to	the	content	area	of our	web	page	and	a	small	change	to	our	script	to	bring	in	that	update	page.  Listing	3-7.	A	Static	HTML	Content	Fragment       	     begin-print  	<a href="createcustomwidget">create-customwidget    custom-widget-apply    done    draw-page    end-print    paginat    preview    request-page-setup    status-changed 	         GtkPrintOperations   The	following	table	describes	the	signals	used	by	the	GtkPrintOperations.

You	should	use	gtk_print_	operation_get_error  	to	check	the	error	message	if the	result	was GTK_PRINT_OPERATION_RESULT_	ERROR.         draw-page   GtkPrintContext	*context	gint	page_num   Each	page	must	be	converted	into	a	Cairo	context. You	can	use	this	callback	to	render	a	page	manually. 	       end-print    end-print   GtkPrintContext	*context 	 All	of	the pages	were	rendered.        paginat 	<td width="25%">GtkPrintContext	*context 	 This	signal	is emitted	after	begin-print	but	before	page rendering	begins.	It	will	continue	to	be	emitted	until	FALSE	is	returned	or	until it	is	not	handled.	This	allows	you to	split	the	document	into	pages	in	steps	so	that	the	user	interface	is	not noticeably	blocked. 	  preview 	<td width="25%">GtkPrintOperationPreview	*preview GtkPrintContext	*context	GtkWindow	*parent 	 The	user requested	a	preview	of	the	document	from the	main	printing	dialog.	This	signal	allows	you	to	create your	own	preview	dialog.	If	this	signal	is	not	handled,	the default	handler	will	be	used.	The	callback	function	returns	TRUE	if	you	are handling	the	print	preview.        	request-page-setup   GtkPrintContext	*context	gint	page_num	GtkPageSetup *setup   This	signal	is	emitted	for	every	page,	which	gives	you	one last	chance	to	edit	the	setup	of	a	page	before	it	is	printed.	Any changes	will	be	applied	to	only	the	current	page! 	      	status-changed   None   Possible	values	are	defined	by	the	GtkPrintStatus enumeration,	and	the	current	value	can	be	retrieved	with gtk_print_operation_get_	status  .              Listing	3-8	shows	how	we	have	made	changes	to	the	content	area	to	enable	our Python	script	to	show	the	data.	This	makes	the	static	data	easy	to	edit	as	it ensures	that	the	rest	of	the	web	page	remains	untouched.  Listing	3-8.

The main	title	has	been	changed,	and	the	content	HTML	fragment	is	different.	Those are	the	only	changes.	An	alternative	to	this	code	would	be	to	pass	the	content area	fragment	file	as	a	parameter	to	the	code	instead	of	hard-coding	it.  Figure	3-3	shows	the	output	from	the	code	in	Listing	3-8.   Figure	3-3.	Output	from	Listing	3-8  You	can	now	see	how	small	changes	can	have	a	major	impact	on	how	our skeletons	display	a	variety	of	data	with	relatively	little	work	on	the	part	of	the administrator developer.	Writers	can	now	concentrate	on	writing	the	output	and not	on	how	to	display	that	data.  A	More	Complicated	Hyperlink	Example  The	following	example	is	a	little	more	complicated	than	the	previous	one.	It consists	of	aselect	HTML	element	 or	list	box	if	you	prefer 	and	a	picture element.	When	you	select	an	entry	in	theselect	element,	it	will	display	the corresponding	picture	on	the	right	side	on	the	content	area.   The	example	does	not	contain	any	new	skeleton	file	from	the	html_lib	directory. Instead,	all	the	work	is	accomplished	in	the	Python	script.	See	Listing	3-9.  Listing	3-9.

First,	a	JavaScript	function has	been	added	near	the	top	of	the	HTML	part	of	the	listing.	This	function	is called	when	a	new	selection	has	been	made	from	theselect	element	 the	list	box . Theonchange	option	on	theselect	element	calls	this	function	when	a	new selection	has	been	made	on	theselect	element.  After	that,	everything	is	pretty	standard	until	we	get	to	the	content	area	further down	in	the	listing.	Rather	than	define	the	content	area	in	a	code	fragment,	we have	decided	to	define	it	in	the	Python	script.	The	decision	was	purely	arbitrary because	this	is	probably	the	only	time	we	will	use	this	combination	of	elements in	the	content	area.  Finally,	we	have	to	get	the	list	of	pictures	and	add	that	to	the	HTML	code	so theselect	element	is	loaded	when	the	HTML	is	displayed	to	the	user.	The picture-loading	code	will	load	all	kinds	of	picture	files	because	they	are	all supported	by	theselect	element.  We	now	have	an	HTML	page	that	is	easy	to	use	and	can	contain	a	large	selection of	pictures.	Figure 3-4	shows	the	output	of	the	code.   Figure	3-4.	Output	from	Listing	3-9  If	you	study	the	code	for	this	example,	you	will	discover	one	of	the	weaknesses of	CGI	programs.	Look	closely	and	you	will	see	that	we	hardcoded	the	directory where	the	pictures	are	stored	into	the	Python	script.	This	is	because	we	can	never use	a	CGI	program	to	“drill	down”	into	the	file	system	because	a	CGI	program always	has	the	same	current	directory.	We	could	pass	the	directory	we	want	to use	to	the	script,	but	how	would	you	know	where	you	came	from	or	where	the next	location	is?	You	would	have	to	jump	through	some	unusual	hoops	to	keep   next	location	is?	You	would	have	to	jump	through	some	unusual	hoops	to	keep track	of	all	this.	The	next	chapter	will	show	you	a	solution	to	this	problem.  Calling	and	Passing	Data	to	a	CGI	Program  Up	until	now,	we	have	just	shown	some	simple	CGI	programs	without	showing you	how	to	call	or	pass	data	to	a	CGI	program.	Calling	a	CGI	program	is	simple and	only	involves	coding	a	proper	URL.	Listing	3-10	shows	an	example.  Listing	3-10.	Calling	a	CGI	Program http:  www.yourserver.com cgi-bin your_python_pgm  The	URL	in	Listing	3-10	has	the	standard	parts.	The	first	part	 http 	specifies	the protocol	to	be	used.	In	our	example,	this	is	the	HTTP	protocol,	but	it	could	also be	the	HTTPS	protocol	 the	secure	HTTP	protocol .	Either	can	be	used,	and	it has	no	impact	on	how	your	Python	program	will	be	coded.  The	next	part	is	the	server	name	or	its	IP	address.	Either	can	be	used,	but	it	is obviously	easier	to	remember	the	server	name	as	its	address	may	change	without notice	to	the	user.  Next	is	the	directory	location	of	your	program.	Most	CGI	programs	are	stored	in thecgi-bindirectory	as	this	is	a	secure	location	for	CGI	programs.	They	can	be	in other	directories,	but	these	should	be	considered	as	insecure	locations	as	they can	expose	the	program’s	source	code	to	the	user.  Next	is	the	name	of	your	CGI	program.	In	our	case,	we	will	always	use	a	Python program,	and	it	will	always	have	a.py	extension.	But	you	should	understand	this is	not	a	safe	practice.	Python	programs	can	be	made	executable	without	an extension,	which	makes	them	safer.	This	is	considered	good	practice	and	is highly	recommended	for	your	environment.  CGI	programs	can	be	coded	in	any	program	language	supported	by	your	server. Some	popular	languages	are	Python,	Perl,	Bash,	Ruby,	and	PHP.	These	are	all interpreted	languages,	but	you	could	also	use	C	or	C++.	All	of	these	languages use	the	same	calling	and	data	passing	mechanism	because	you	are	passing	data to	the	HTTP	server	and	not	directly	to	the	program	itself.  The	HTTP	server	may	use	two	methods	of	passing	data	to	a	program.	These	are known	as	the	GET	and	POST	methods.	We	will	examine	both	methods	in	the   known	as	the	GET	and	POST	methods.	We	will	examine	both	methods	in	the following	sections.  The	GET	Method  The	GET	method	involves	passing	data	as	an	appended	set	of	information	to	the URL	request.	The	information	is	appended	to	the	URL	request	and	is	separated by	the?	character,	as	shown	in	Listing	3-11.  Listing	3-11.	An	Example	GET	Method	with	Parameters http:  www.example.com cgi-bin hello.py?name1=value1&name2=value2  The	GET	method	is	the	default	method	of	passing	parameter	information	from the	browser	to	the	web	server,	and	it	also	produces	a	string	of	text	in	the browser’s	location	box.	This	method	is	insecure,	so	never	use	it	to	pass	sensitive data	to	the	server	such	as	a	password	or	other	sensitive	information.	The	GET method	has	a	size	limitation	of	1,024	bytes	in	the	URL	request	string.	The	data you	send	to	the	server	appears	in	the	environment	using	theQUERY_STRING, which	we	saw	earlier.	Each	name 	variable	is	separated	from	the	next	via	an ampersand	 & .  A	Simple	Example	GET	Method  Listing 3-12	shows	an	example	of	a	simple	GET	method,	which	will	pass	two	values	to the	programexample3-9. Listing	3-12.	Using	the	GET	Method	to	Pass	Data http:  www.holmes4.com cgi-bin example3-9.py?first_name=David& lastname=Ashley  Listing	3-13	shows	the	example3-9.py	program,	which	handles	the	input	given by	the	web	browser.	Note	that	we	are	using	the	Pythoncgi	module,	which	makes it	easy	to	access	the	arguments	passed	by	the	browser.  Listing	3-13.

This	will	obtain	all	the	GET	arguments	for	us.	The	rest of	the	work	is	contained	in	thecontent_right	part	of	the code.	We	then	test	each	argument	to	see	whether	it	actually	exists	in	the form	variable.	If	it	does	not,	then	we	set	the	corresponding	Python	variable to	a	zero-length	string.	Then	we	can	construct	the	HTML	form	as	well	as display	the	Python	name	variables. Figure	3-5	shows	the	output	of	our	example.   Figure	3-5.	Output	of	the	simple	GET	method	example  As	you	can	see,	we	have	successfully	displayed	the	arguments	in	our	example program	shown	earlier.	The	main	point	here	is	that	it	does	not	matter	where	the input	comes	from	 the	command	line	or	the	HTML	form ;	the	first	and	last names	will	always	be	displayed	if	it	was	not	a	zerolength	string.   Important	all	parameters	and	arguments	in	Cgi	programs	are	passed	as	textual data.	if	your	python	script	needs	to	use	the	data	in	either	fixed	binary	or	floating- point	format,	then	you	will	need	to	convert	it	from	textual	to	the	binary	format you	need.  The	POST	Method  The	POST	method	can	be	invoked	only	via	an	HTML	form.	It	may	not	be invoked	from	the	command	line.	This	makes	the	data	passed	to	your	Python script	much	safer	since	it	is	encrypted	to	some	extent.	This	is	not	to	say	that	you cannot	pass	data	via	the	GET	method	to	a	script	that	in	turn	uses	the	POST method	to	pass	on	data	to	another	program.	Just	remember	that	sensitive	data should	not	be	passed	to	a	CGI	program	via	the	GET	method.  Luckily,	the	POST	method	is	used	almost	exclusively	in	HTML	forms.	And	in Python	it	does	not	matter	which	method	you	use.	Thecgi	module	detects	which method	is	being	used	and	collects	and	presents	the	arguments	to	you	using	the same	method.

The	Python	script	is similar	to	the	previous	examples,	with	the	data	assignments	for	thecontent_right variable	being	the	only	real	difference.	Therefore,	Listing	3-15	shows	only	that area	of	the	program.  Listing	3-15.

Everything	needed	to	get	the	text	data	passed	to	the	program appears	just	in	the	assignments	to	thedata	variable.  One	thing	to	note	here	is	that	the	crlf	characters	from	the	passed	data	are	ignored by	the	HTML	processor.	If	you	need	them	to	be	presented	to	the	user,	you	will need	to	replace	thecrlfcharacters	with	the	HTML 	tag	before	assigning thetextdata	variable	to	thedata	variable.  Figure 3-7	shows	how	the	data	will	be	presented	to	the	user.   Figure	3-7.

Using	POST	with	a	dropdown	Box  The	next	example	shows	how	to	utilize	an	HTML	dropdown	box.	The	dropdown box	is	a	compact	alternative	to	thelistbox	and	can	even	be	used	as	a	replacement for	a	set	of	radio	buttons.	Listing	3-16	shows	our	example	Python	CGI	script	for dealing	with	adropdown	box.  Listing	3-16.

The dropdownbox	can	hold	a	lot	of	possible	entries,	so	it	can	save	a	lot	of	space	on your	HTML	page,	thus	making	it	a	cleaner	design	for	the	user.  Cookies	in	CGI  The	HTTP	protocol	is	what	is	known	as	a	stateless	protocol.	The	server	does	not maintain	any	data	that	connects	the	user	to	a	set	of	transactions.	Once	the	CGI program	ends	a	transaction,	all	memory	of	what	was	transferred	is	lost	by	the server;	in	other	words,	the	HTTP	server	cannot	maintain	a	session	with	the	user between	CGI	transactions.  To	work	around	this	problem,	modern	web	designers	use	cookies	to	remember what	has	transferred	between	transactions.	This	provides	“pseudo”	session	state information	between	the	user’s	browser	and	the	HTTP	server.	This	especially useful	for	remembering	the	user’s	database	login	information,	file	information, items	in	a	cart,	or	any	other	information	that	is	required	by	the	transaction.  Sending	Cookies	from	the	Server  Cookies	always	originate	from	the	HTTP	server,	never	from	the	browser.	When the	server	sends	a	cookie	to	the	browser,	the	browser	may	accept	or	deny	the cookie	information.	Often	this	decision	is	made	by	the	user.	If	the	cookie	is accepted,	it	is	saved	by	the	browser.	When	the	user	sends	information	back	to the	server,	the	browser	includes	the	previously	sent	cookie	with	the	new	CGI transaction.	The	server	may	then	utilize	the	information	in	any	way	it	chooses.  Cookies	are	sent	by	the	HTTP	server	in	plain-text	form	as	part	of	the	HTTP header	in	the	HTML	returned	to	the	user’s	browser.	It	must	appear	prior	to theContent-type	header	statement.	Listing	3-17	shows	how	to	construct	a	cookie.  Listing	3-17.	Sending	a	Cookie	from	the	HTTP	Server	! usr bin python3  cookie	=	"""Set-Cookie:UserID	=	myuserid;\r\n Set-Cookie:Password	=	mypassword;\r\n Set-Cookie:Expires	=	Monday,	4-April-2020	17:30:00	GMT;\r\n	Set- Cookie:Domain	=	www.holmes4.com;\r\n Set-Cookie:Path	=	 home myuserid;\r\n Set-Cookie:name1	=	value1;\r\n Content-type:text html\r\n\r\n"""   Content-type:text html\r\n\r\n"""  	the	rest	of	the	HTML	header	information	would	follow The	general	form	of	a	cookie	statement	is	as	follows: Set-Cookie:name	=	value;  The	first	four	statements	listed	earlier	are	standard	for	cookies,	while	the	last statement	is	the	more	general	form.	The	following	defines	the	standard statements:   	UserID:	The	user	ID	of	the	user.	This	is	usually	used	for	identification purposes	for	either	the	system	and or	the	database.   	Password:	The	password	for	the	user	ID	listed previously.   	Expires:	The	date	the	cookies	will	expire.	This	date	is	based	on	the	browser’s location	and	not	the	HTTP	server’s	location.	If	blank,	the	cookie	will	expire	at the	end	of	the	browser’s	session	with	the	server.   	Domain:	The	domain	name	of	the	HTTP	server.  	Path:	The	path	of	the	directory	or	web	page	that	sets	the	cookie.	This	can	be blank	if	you	want	to	retrieve	the	cookie	from	a	directory	page	or	page.   	Secure:	If	this	field	contains	the	word	secure,	then	the	cookie	may	only	be retrieved	with	a	secure	server	using	the	HTTPS	protocol.	If	it	is	blank,	no	such restriction	exists.   	Name=value:	All	cookies	have	this	general	form	of	name-value	pairs.	You	are free	to	choose	your	own	names	provided	they	do	not	override	the	ones	listed previously.  All	of	the	standard	name-value	pairs	listed	are	optional	and	do	not	need	to appear	in	a	cookie.	This	is	useful	when	setting	temporary	cookies. AllSet-Cookie	statements	should	appear	before	theContenttype:text html r n r n line	in	the	HTTP	header.  Retrieving	Cookies  Cookies	may	be	retrieved	easily.	They	are	stored	in	the	CGI	environment variableHTTP_COOKIE,	and	they	have	the	following	form:   variableHTTP_COOKIE,	and	they	have	the	following	form: Name1=value1;name2=value2;...;namen=valuen;  You	should	note	this	is	the	same	form	as	the	QUERY_STRING	environment variable	value.	The	code	excerpt	in	Listing	3-18	should	provide	an	example	to help	you	retrieve	cookie	information.  Listing	3-18.

Summary  This	chapter	introduced	CGI	programming	using	Python.	We	covered	a	number of	topics	in	this	chapter	related	to	CGI	programming	including	HTML,	SSL,	and some	specific	Python	techniques	to	help	you	in	your	own	coding.	The	following is	a	summary	of	the	good	and	bad	of	using	CGI	programming	for	your	project:   	BAD:	Each	time	a	CGI	program	is	invoked,	a	new process	is	spawned	by	the	HTTP	server	to	process	the	request.	When	the	CGI program	finishes,	the	process	is	destroyed.	This	takes	some	time	and	does	have an	impact	on	the	performance	of	the	HTTP	server.	However,	improvements	to   the	Linux	operating	system	in	recent	years	and	newer,	faster	processors	have improved	the	performance	of	invoking	and	tearing	down	new	processes	to	the point	that	the	impact	of	a	new	process	for	each	CGI	program	is	greatly	reduced. Nevertheless,	this	potential	problem	should	be	kept	in	mind.   	GOOD:	When	the	HTTP	server	invokes	a	new	process	for	a	CGI	program,	it does	so	with	a	specialized	set	of	environment	variables	that	hide	much	of	the server’s	sensitive	data.   	BAD:	As	with	any	programs	that	interact	with	users,	you	should	not	trust	any	of the	data	that	comes	back	from	using	HTML	forms.	Users	are	an	inventive	lot and	will	try	any	way	to	get	the	data	they	want	and	not	necessarily	the	data	you want	to	provide.	Basically,	you	should	always	verify,	verify,	verify	all	data	you receive	from	a	user.	If	you	do	not,	you	will	eventually	have	trouble.   	BAD:	Do	not	trust	path	data	provided	by	a	user,	especially	for	file	uploads.	For that	matter,	watch	out	for	bad	filenames	as	well.   	BAD:	Verify	all	data	from	the	user	to	make	sure	it	does	not	contain	HTML. This	type	of	data	can	be	hard	to	locate	or	debug.  	BAD:	If	you	are	executing	external	programs	in	your	script,	be	sure	that	if information	for	that	program	comes	from	the	user,	you	verify	it	first.   	BAD:	CGI	script program	permissions	under	Linux 	Unix	are	also	potential problem	areas.	Be	sure	that	you	verify	those	permission	and	occasionally	ensure they	have	not	been	modified.   	BAD:	Try	not	to	use	scripts	not	authored	by	you	or	your	organization.	These scripts	might	be	performing	functions	that	you	do	not	understand	or	even	know about.  CHAPTER	4 Using	SSI	and	Python  The	Server	Side	Includes	 SSI 	scripting	language	triggers	further	processing	on your	static	web	pages.	The	server	parses	an	HTML	page	looking	for	SSI directives.	It	then	processes	those	directives	and	creates	a	new	page	that	in	turn is	passed	back	to	the	user.	The	modification	directives	that	SSI	supplies	can	do   is	passed	back	to	the	user.	The	modification	directives	that	SSI	supplies	can	do simple	text	replacement	or	can	call	programs	to	supply	the	text.	The	range	of possibilities	is	endless	for	SSI,	and	you	will	see	an	example	of	each	SSI	directive in	this	chapter.  Getting	Started  To	use	SSI	directives	in	your	HTML	pages,	you	must	configure	SSI	in	the	server configuration	file.	It	is	easy	to	perform	this	configuration,	but	it	must	be	placed in	the	main	portion	of	the	config	file.	There	are	only	two	statements	to	add,	as shown	in	Listing	4-1.  Listing	4-1.	SSI	Configuration	Statements AddHandler	server-parsed	.shtml Options	+Includes After	adding	these	statements,	you	will	need	to	restart	the	HTTP	server	to activate	them.  Note	You	may	also	have	to	addIncludes	inOptions	Indexes	FollowSymLinks	to make	this	work	with	the	default	settings,	as	shown	here:     Options	Indexes	Includes	FollowSymLinks AllowOverride	None Require	all	granted     The	shtml	portion	of	theAddHandler	statement	specifies	the	file	extension	that will	be	used	to	tell	the	server	which	HTML	files	need	to	be	parsed	for	SSI directives.	Only	files	with	this	extension	will	be	parsed	for	SSI	directives.  If	your	website	is	running	on	a	Unix	or	Linux	operating	system,	there	is	an alternative	available	to	using	a	special	filename	for	HTML	files	that	contain	SSI directives.	The	HTTP	server	directiveXBitHack	allows	you	to	set	the	owner execute	bit	on	the	file	to	indicate	that	the	server	should	parse	the	file	for	SSI directives.	If	you	choose	to	use	this	directive,	then	your	server	config	file	should contain	the	directives	shown	in	Listing	4-2.   Listing	4-2.	SSI	Configuration	Statements	with	XBitHack	Directive  AddHandler	server-parsed	.shtml	Options	+Includes XBitHack	on  When	configured	this	way,	the	.shtml	file	extensions	will	be	ignored,	and	only files	with	the	owner	execute	bit	set	will	be	parsed	for	SSI	directives.  There	are	additional	statements	that	can	be	placed	in	the	HTTP	server configuration	file	that	will	alter	the	processing	of	the	file	by	SSI,	but	we	will look	at	those	later	in	this	chapter.  Important	ssi	directives	placed	in	the	output	of	Cgi	programs	will	not	be processed.	this	because	no	filename	is	associated	with	the	Cgi	output,	so	the server	has	no	way	to	know	whether	it	needs	to	be	parsed.  SSI	directives	are	really	no	more	than	specially	formatted	HTML	comments. This	to	make	them	stand	out	from	normal	comments	and	be	easily	parsed	by	the server.	The	general	format	of	an	SSI	directive	follows:     The	pound	sign	 	 	is	what	identifies	this	comment	as	an	SSI	directive.	If	a directive	accepts	attributes,	then	the	attributes	should	follow	the	directive	name. There	are	eight	SSI	directives	plus	some	miscellaneous	ones,	and	the	following sections	describe	each	one.  The	config	SSI	Directive  The	config	directive	controls	some	aspects	of	parsing.	Three	attributes	are available,	all	of	which	have	default	values.	This	directive	overrides	the	default	or any	previous	modification	to	the	attribute.	It	can	appear	more	than	once	in	your HTML	file	or	not	at	all.	The	syntax	is	as	follows:  <!--config	errmsg="Your	error	msg"	sizefmt="The	format	for	display	od	file sizes" timefmt="Format	for	displaying	time	values"	-->	The	following	are	the definitions	for	each	attribute:   definitions	for	each	attribute: errmg sizefmt  timefmt	this	is	the	message	sent	back	to	the	client	when	an	error	occurs	during document	parsing. this	is	the	value	to	use	when	displaying	the	size	of	a	file.	Valid	values	arebytes orabbrev	for	a	size	in	kilobytes	or	megabytes	as	appropriate. this	value	is	the	same	as	passed	to	the	C	functionstrftime  	library	routine.  Listing	4-3	shows	a	simple	HTML	page	that	displays	each	attribute	of	the	config directive.	We	deliberately	removed	all	the	framing	from	the	example	to	make	it as	simple	as	possible.	Obviously,	this	will	work	on	a	more	complicated	HTML page	as	well.  Listing	4-3.	An	Example	HTML	Page	Using	the	SSI	errmsg	Directive          Example4-1           Example4-1	-	errmsg	SSI	Directive   The	following	is	an	example	of	the	 config	errmsg 	SSI	directive.	The error	message	should	be "This	is	an	example	error!".     	   The	following	is	an	example	of	the	 config	sizefmt 	SSI	directive.	The file	size	should	be	presented	in	either	kilobytes	or	megabytes.         The	following	is	an	example	of	the	 config	timefmt 	SSI	directive.	The file	time	should	be	presented	as	"%A	%Y-%m-%d	%H:%M:%S".               The	code	in	Listing 4-3	will	display	in	the	browser	as	shown	in	Figure	4-1.  Figure	4-1.	Output	from	Listing	4-3  As	you	can	see,	this	SSI	directive	can	save	you	a	lot	of	work	updating	content	in your	HTML	pages.	When	the	file	is	modified,	the	file	size	and	update	timestamp can	also	be	updated	automatically.  The	error	message	produced	can	also	be	modified	throughout	the	document	to make	it	specific	to	errors	in	different	parts	of	the	document.  The	echo	SSI	Directive   The	echo	SSI	directive	prints	out	the	value	of	an	assigned	environment	variable. A	limited	number	of	environment	variables	can	be	printed	in	the	document. There	is	only	one	attribute	available	for	this	directive,	and	it	is	documented	here:  var	this	is	the	name	of	the	environment	to	be	printed.	only	the	following environment	variables	may	be	specified:DATE_GMT,	DATE_LOCAL, DOCUMENT_NAME,DOCUMENT_URI,	andLAST_MODIFIED.  Listing 4-4 shows	an	example	of	each	possibility	for	theecho	directive. Listing	4-4.	An	Example	of	the	SSI	echo	Directive          Example4-2          Example4-2	-	errmsg	SSI	Directive   The	following	is	an	example	of	the	 config	echo 	SSI	directive.   DATE_GMT	=	  	 DATE_LOCAL =	  	 DOCUMENT_NAME	=	<!-- echo	var="DOCUMENT_NAME"--> 	 DOCUMENT_URI	=	<!--echo var="DOCUMENT_URI"--> 	 LAST_MODIFIED	=	<!--echo var="LAST_MODIFIED"-->      The	code	in	Listing	4-4	will	display	in	the	browser	as	shown	in	Figure	4-2.   Figure	4-2.	Output	from	Listing	4-4  Although	the	number	of	environment	variables	is	restricted,	the	echo	directive	is still	a	convenient	directive	to	use	when	needed.	It	can	still	save	time	and	reduce the	number	of	times	an	HTML	file	is	updated.  The	exec	SSI	Directive  The	exec	SSI	directive	executes	either	a	shell	command	or	a	CGI	script.	A prudent	webmaster	will	put	the	option	IncludesNOEXEC	in	the	server	config file	to	disable	this	SSI	directive.	But	if	available,	it	allows	the	output	from	a	shell command,	program,	or	CGI	script	to	be	included	at	that	point	in	the	HTML	file. Two	attributes	are	available	for	theexec	directive,	as	documented	here:  cgi	this	is	a%-encoded	UrL	relative	path	to	the	Cgi	script.	if	the	path	does	not include	a	leading	slash,	it	is	taken	to	be	relative	to	the	current	document.	the document	is	invoked	as	a	Cgi	script	even	if	the	server	does	not	recognize	it	as	a Cgi	program.	all	the	rules	for	a	directory	containing	a	Cgi	script	must	be observed.	ifsuexec	is	turned	on,	it	will	be	enforced.the	QUERY_STRING andPATH_INFO	environment	variables	passed	to	the	original	document	will	be passed	in	turn	to	the	specified	Cgi	script	as	well	as	the	include	variables.	note   passed	in	turn	to	the	specified	Cgi	script	as	well	as	the	include	variables.	note that	the	include	virtual	ssi	directive	should	be	used	in	preference	to	theexec directive	if	possible.  cmd	the	server	prepends	the bin sh	string	to	the	front	of	this	attribute	and	then attempts	to	execute	it.	theinclude	variables	are	available	to	the	command,	and	its output	of	the	program	will	be	included	in	the	htML	file	at	that	point.  Important	the	documentation	for	the	ssiexec	directive	is	not	exactly	clear.	You should	be	aware	that	whatever	htML	appears	in	the	original	htML	request	will be	thrown	away	on	successful	execution	of	the	code	being	called.	this	is	true	for both	thecgi	and	cmd	attributes.  Listing 4-5 shows	an	example	of	both	attributes. Listing	4-5.	Example	Code	for	the	SSI	Directives	exec	cgi	and	exec	cmd                   	    	     Note	that	the	only	thing	the	documents	in	Listing	4-5	do	is	call	the	SSI directivesexec	cgi	and	exec	cmd.	These	commands	will	in	turn	call	a	script	to output	the	actual	HTML	for	the	request.  Listing	4-6	shows	the	code	for	both	commands. Listing	4-6.

" echo	"The	current	date	is	$ date . " echo	" " echo	" "  The	code	in	Listing	4-6	is	responsible	for	all	the	output	from	each	request.	The Python	script	is	called	for	the	first	request,	and	the	shell	script	is	called	from	the second	request.  Figure	4-3	shows	the	output	from	each	request.   Figure	4-3.	Output	from	the	two	previous	code	listings  Figure	4-3	shows	the	output	in	the	browser.	You	cannot	quite	see	it,	but	the request	field	indicates	that	this	output	came	from	the	original	HTML	request	and not	the	scripts	that	were	called	from	the	HTML.	This	hides	the	fact	that	a	CGI	or CMD	SSI	directive	was	called	to	actually	create	the	output	dynamically.	Even	if   you	look	at	the	source	for	the	document,	you	cannot	tell	it	did	not	come	from	the HTML	request.	This	could	be	useful	in	hiding	just	how	the	output	HTML	was created.  You	should	also	note	that	the	QUERY_STRING andCONTEXT_DOCUMENT_	ROOT	are	the	values	passed	to	the	original HTML	request	and	remain	unmodified	when	passed	to	thecgi	andcmd	attributes. There	could	be	other	environment	variables	that	have	original	values	as	well. This	can	be	useful	when	the	directory	where	the	HTML	file	resides	is	important to	the	request.  It	is	preferable	to	use	the	include	SSI	directive	instead	of	theexec	directive wherever	possible	as	the	potential	of	a	security	failure	goes	up	when	thisexec directive	is	used.  The	fsize	SSI	Directive  This	directive	prints	the	size	of	the	specified	file.	The	output	is	dependent	on thesizefmt	attribute	from	theconfig	SSI	directive.	There	are	two	attributes  mutually	exclusive 	to	specify	the	file,	as	described	here:  file	this	is	a	path filename	relative	to	the	directory	containing	the	current	htML file.  virtual	the%-encoded	UrL	path	relative	to	theDOCUMENT_ROOT	from	the server	config	file.	if	the	specification	does	not	begin	with	a	slash	   ,	it	means that	it	is	relative	to	the	current	htML	document.  Listing 4-7 contains	examples	of	bothfsize	attributes.	They	both	will	appear	in	the	HTML page’s	output. Listing	4-7.

The	example	in	Figure	4-4	has	paragraph	tags	surrounding	the	size	so	that	it stands	out	in	the	example.	Also,	the	size	of	the	original	HTML	file	is	small,	less than	a	kilobyte	in	size,	which	means	there	is	not	a	qualifier	for	the	size.  The	flastmod	SSI	Directive  This	directive	prints	the	last	modification	timestamp	of	the	specified	file.	The output	is	dependent	on	thetimefmt	attribute	from	theconfig	SSI	directive.	There are	two	attributes	 mutually	exclusive 	to	specify	the	file,	as	described	here:  file	this	is	a	path filename	relative	to	the	directory	containing	the	current	htML   file.  virtual	this	is	the%-encoded	UrL	path	relative	to	theDOCUMENT_ROOT	from the	server	config	file.	if	the	specification	does	not	begin	with	a	slash	   ,	it	means that	it	is	relative	to	the	current	htML	document.

The	timestamp	is	shown	using	the	default	format.  The	include	SSI	Directive  This	directive	prints	the	contents	of	the	file	pointed	to	by	the	attribute.	There	are two	attributes	 mutually	exclusive 	to	specify	the	file,	described	here: file	this	is	a	path filename	relative	to	the	directory	containing	the	current	htML file.  virtual	the%-encoded	UrL	path	relative	to	theDOCUMENT_ROOT	from	the server	config	file.	if	the	specification	does	not	begin	with	a	slash	   ,	it	means   that	it	is	relative	to	the	current	htML	document.  Listing 4-9 contains	examples	of	bothinclude	attributes.	They	both	will	appear	in	the	HTML page’s	output. Listing	4-9.	The	HTML	Document	Containing	the	flastmod	Directive          Example4-6         Example4-6	-	include	SSI	Directive   The	following	is	an	example	of	the	 include	file=  SSI	directive.     The	following	is	an	example	of	the	 include	virtual= 	SSI	directive.    	     Figure	4-6	shows	the	browser	output	after	requesting	this	document.   Output	from	the	include	directive	appears	inline	within	the	output	HTML	page. You	should	ensure	that	the	included	content	is	a	real	HTML	fragment	and	not	an entire	HTML	page.  Please	note	it	is	not	possible	to	call	a	script	using	this	directive.	Also,	the included	file	may	not	contain	other	SSI	directives	as	they	will	be	ignored.   Additional	SSI	Directives  We	will	be	introducing	several	SSI	directives	and	concepts	in	this	section because	they	are	all	closely	related.	This	will	include	theset	directive,	additional variables	that	can	be	used	in	your	SSI	HTML	pages,	and	conditional	directives for	selecting	sets	of	phrases	to	be	included	in	your	document.  You	should	note	that	all	the	directives	and	variables	described	in	this	section	are available	in	Apache	version	2.4	and	newer.	They	may	not	be	available	in	your HTTP	server.  The	SSI	set	Directive  The	set	directive	is	used	to	set	the	value	of	variables.	These	variables	are	then available	to	the	conditional	directives	we	will	describe	later.	The	following shows	an	example	of	this	directive:     The	two	attributes	var	andvalue	describe	the	name	of	the	variable	and	its assigned	value,	respectively.	In	addition,	there	are	two	more	attributes	that	are used	only	occasionally.	They	aredecoding	andencoding	and	are	used	for encoding	and	decoding	thevalue	passed	to	the	variable	name.	There	are	several values	you	can	pass	in	these	attributes	depending	on	the	encoding	you	want	to translate	to from	thevalue	attribute.	You	should	see	the	Apache	documentation before	attempting	to	use	them.  In	addition	to	setting	a	literal	string	to	the	value,	you	can	also	assign	some additional	variable,	which	we	will	describe	next.	An	example	of	this	is	shown here:     Note	the	dollar	sign	 	$ 	at	the	beginning	of	the	variable	name.	This	indicates	the variable	already	exists	and	the	value	of	the	variable	should	be	used.	If	you	need to	put	a	literal	dollar	sign	at	the	start	of	your	value	string,	you	can	escape	the dollar	sign	with	the	backslash	character,	as	shown	here:    Finally,	if	you	want	to	put	a	variable	in	the	middle	of	a	string,	you	should   Finally,	if	you	want	to	put	a	variable	in	the	middle	of	a	string,	you	should surround	the	variable	name	with	curly	brackets,	as	shown	here:	<!--set var="doc_name"	value="	This	document	is	named	${DOCUMENT_NAME}."-- >  One	last	thing	of	note	is	to	not	use	uppercase	for	your	variable	names.	Apache reserves	the	right	to	add	new	variables	to	the	current	list,	and	those	names	will be	uppercase	names.  The	current	list	of	available	variable	names	is	as	follows: DATE_GMT	this	is	theserver’s	current	timestamp	in	gMt	format. DATE_LOCAL DOCUMENT_ARGS  DOCUMENT_NAME	DOCUMENT_PATH_INFO	this	is	the	server’s	current timestamp	in	the	server’s	local	format.  this	is	the	same	as	the	Cgi	variable	QUERY_STRING.	if	no	arguments	were passed,	this	will	be	the	empty	string.	this	is	the	filename	of	the	current	htML	file. this	is	the	same	the	CgiPATH_INFO	variable.  continued  DOCUMENT_URO LAST_MODIFIED	QUERY_STRING_	UNESCAPED  USER_NAME this	is	the	main	htMLDOCUMENT_URI.	in	the	cases	of	nested	includes,	this	is not	the	Uri	of	the	nested	file.  this	is	the	last	modified	timestamp	of	the	main	htML	file.	this	is	the	unescaped value	of	the	query	string. this	is	the	username	of	the	owner	of	the	main	htML	document.  All	of	these	variables	are	available	to	be	used	in	the	set	directive	as	well	as	all the	conditional	directives. Listing	4-10	shows	examples	of	all	of	these	variables.  Listing	4-10.

The	output	from	Listing	4-10  The	SSI	Conditional	Directives  The	SSI	conditional	directives	allow	the	user	to	specify	HTML	text	to	be included	under	certain	conditions.	The	directives	areif,elif,else,	and	endif.	These directives	operate	in	almost	the	same	way	as	the	C C++	directives	with	the	same names.	Theif	directive	specifies	a	condition,	and	if	it	is	true,	the	text	following	it is	included	in	the	document.	Theelif	directive	specifies	a	different	condition	that is	evaluated	if	the	previous	if	orelif	condition	is	false.	Theelse	condition	includes the	text	that	follows	it	if	all	previous	conditions	are	false.	Theendif	directive ends	all	conditional	text.  Warning	do	not	mix	the	conditional	directives	with	the	previously documentedset	directive.the	conditional	directives	are	all	evaluated	early	in	the parsing	phase	of	the	htML.	theset	directive	 as	well	as	all	other	ssi	directives 	is evaluated	in	a	later	phase	after	all	the	conditional	directives	have	already	been evaluated.	thus,	the	conditional	directives	have	no	access	to	the	variables produced	by	the	set	directive.  Listing 4-11 shows	how	this	works. Listing	4-11.	A	Sample	HTMP	Page	Using	the	Conditional	Directives          Example4-8          Example4-8	-	Conditional	Directives 	 The	following	is	an example	of	the	SSI	conditional  directives.    directives.        The	Name	is	correct.     The	Name	is	NOT	correct.       The	Admin	is	missing.         Figure 4-8	shows	one	possible	output	 depending	on	the	calling	argument .  Figure	4-8.	One	possible	output	from	Listing	4-11 The	URL	to	run	the	script	shown	in	Figure	4-8 is	as	follows:	http:  www.holmes4.com book example4-8.html?name=David  The	previous	command	is	the	correct	way	to	obtain	a	positive	result	from	the script.	Any	other	name	or	not	providing	one	at	all	will	give	a	negative	result.  The	syntax	of	the	conditional	directive	is	simple	and	matches	the	other	directives we	have	examined	so	far.	There	is	only	a	single	attribute,	and	it	is	used	on	theif   we	have	examined	so	far.	There	is	only	a	single	attribute,	and	it	is	used	on	theif andelif	conditional	directives.	Theexpr	attribute	specifies	the	conditional expression	to	be	evaluated.	The	syntax	of	this	condition	will	be	explored	a	little later.	If	the	condition	is	true,	then	the	text	following	the	directive	will	be included.	The	text	can	include	other	conditional	directives	or	and	of	the	SSI directives.	Text	is	included	until	either	anelif,	else,	orendif	SSI	directive	is found.	If	the	expression	is	false,	all	the	text	is	skipped	until	the	next	conditional directive	is	found.  If	we	examine	the	condition	on	the	if	directive,	we	see	that	something	called theQUERY_STRINGis	being	examined	for	something	on	the	right	side	of	the expression.	TheQUERY_STRING	is	the	same	as	for	the	CGI	scripts.	This	is surrounded	by%{...}	to	mark	it	as	a	known	variable.	We	will	list	all	the	known variables	for	conditional	expressions	a	little	later.	The	right	side	of	the expression	is	a	regular	expression.	This	expression	uses	the	same	syntax	as regular	expressions	in	Perl	5.0.	The	middle	operator	specifies	how	the	variables on	each	side	are	to	be	evaluated.	We	will	examine	all	the	possible	operators	a little	later.  Table	4-1	describes	all	the	available	variables	for	use	by	the	conditional directives.	These	are	the	only	variables	that	can	be	used	by	the	conditional directives.  The	tables	that	follow	are	all	taken	from	sources	on	the	Web,	and	any	incorrect information	is	my	mistake. Table	4-1.

While	it	does not	fit	every	situation,	it	is	a	useful	tool	for	easing	your	web	server	maintenance. Used	under	the	right	circumstances,	it	can	make	everything	easier.  This	chapter	has	introduced	all	the	concepts	needed	to	make	SSI	work	for	you whatever	your	needs.	Just	remember	that	the	main	SSI	directives	are	evaluated after	the	SSI	conditional	directives.  CHAPTER	5 Using	Flask	and	Jinja  Flask	and	Jinja	are	the	main	two	components	of	a	Python	system	to	manage	a dynamic	website.	This	system	has	similarities	to	other	systems	like	Django.	All of	these	systems	consist	of	a	web	server	and	two	Python	components—a management	component	and	a	dynamic	web	page	component.	The	idea	behind this	system	is	that	the	website	should	not	be	constrained	to	only	one	way	of solving	a	problem.	The	designer	should	be	able	to	choose	the	components	that work	for	their	situation.  Depending	on	the	needs,	other	components	could	be	added	into	the	mix.	These might	be	components	such	as	a	database,	a	document	management	system,	a video	playback	system,	or	any	other	component	to	manage	something	connected to	a	computer.	Of	course,	most	website	designers	would	prefer	that	any	system connected	to	the	website	had	a	Python	interface.	But	if	a	Python	interface	is	not available,	other	drivers	could	be	used,	provided	that	Python	interfaces	could	be developed.  All	of	this	means	a	website	designer	has	choices.	Countless	successful	websites have	been	designed	that	utilize	these	components.	Obviously,	website	designers have	embraced	the	choices	that	have	been	provided	by	utilizing	these   have	embraced	the	choices	that	have	been	provided	by	utilizing	these components.	But	there	are	drawbacks.	This	chapter	will	examine	the	advantages and	the	disadvantages	of	using	Flask	and	Jinja	as	well	as	suggest	some	solutions for	the	weaknesses	you	will	encounter.  This	chapter	is	divided	into	two	major	sections.	In	the	first	section,	you	will learn	about	the	Web	Server	Gateway	Interface	 WSGI 	and	Flask	components and	how	to	install	and	use	them.	In	the	second	section,	I	will	demonstrate	the Jinja2	template	component	and	how	to	create	dynamic	web	pages.  WSGI	and	Flask  WSGI	and	Flask	are	two	components	that	work	together	to	provide	a	powerful mechanism	to	create	and	manage	dynamic	web	pages.	In	this	section,	I	will discuss	how	to	install	and	test	each	component.	Our	test	system	in	this	chapter uses	Fedora	Linux	and	the	Apache	HTTP	Server,	which	are	pretty	common	in the	real	world.	But	if	your	system	runs	a	different	operating	system	or	web server,	the	instructions	will	be	different.	I	will	try	to	provide	options	for	you	in that	case,	but	they	may	not	be	complete.  The	Flask	component	requires	that	WSGI	be	installed	to	work	at	all.	So,	our	first examples	will	involve	installing	and	testing	WSGI.  Installing	and	Testing	WSGI  WSGI	can	be	installed	in	two	ways.	Your	operating	system	may	provide	an installable	package	for	WSGI,	or	you	may	have	to	install	the	latest	WSGI	source code	and	compile	it	yourself.	In	both	cases,	you	will	still	need	to	configure	it using	the	web	server	configuration	file,	which	we	will	discuss	a	little	later	in	the chapter.  If	your	operating	system	provides	a	WSGI	package,	I	highly	recommend	that you	install	and	use	that	package	since	it	is	already	compiled	specifically	for	your operating	system.	For	Windows	users,	your	only	real	option	for	a	web	server	is Apache.	The	source	for	WSGI	assumes	that	Apache	and	its	development environment	are	already	installed	on	your	system.	You	have	the	choice	of downloading	the	source	or	installing	a	prebuilt	version	viapip.  To	install	usingpip,	run	the	following	command: pip	install	mod_wsgi   pip	install	mod_wsgi  This	will	install	the	latest	release	of	mod_wsgi,	so	all	you	have	left	is	to configure	it	in	the	Apache	configuration	file.	There	are	more	complete instructions	athttps:  pypi.org project wsgi.  If	your	system	has	an	installable	mod_wsgi	package,	you	should	use	it	if	it	meets your	requirements.	Our	test	system	is	a	64-bit	Fedora	system	running	Apache	2.4 and	Python	3.6.	You	should	make	sure	that	whatever	versions	of	Python,	web server,	and	mod_wsgi	you	are	trying	to	use	are	compatible	with	each	other.	That was	easy	with	Fedora	since	an	installable	package	was	available.	To installmod_wsgi	on	Fedora,	use	the	following	command:  sudo	dnf	install	python3-mod_wsgi  This	will	install	the	mod_wsgimodule	so	it	can	be	used	by	Apache.	After	this, we	still	need	to	configure	it	for	use	by	the	Apache	web	server.	After	the	install, you	should	make	sure	that	some	configuration	has	been	done.	First,	make	sure the	following	file	has	been	created	 Linux	only :   etc httpd conf.modules.d  This	file	will	ensure	that	the	WSGI	module	has	been	installed	into	Apache.	Next, you	will	need	to	perform	some	manual	configuration	either	on	the	main	server thread	config	file	or	on	a	virtual	server	file	located	in 	etc httpd conf.d.	The configuration	for	WSGI	looks	something	like	this:  WSGIScriptAlias	 wsgitest	 pub www holmes4 docroot wsgitest 	wsgitest.wsgi    Require	all	granted    The	first	line	specifies	the	Python	script	to	be	run.	There	is	a	lot	about	this	line that	we	need	to	understand	as	it	impacts	a	lot	about	the	script	to	be	run.	The	first parameter, wgitest,	has	two	functions	and	supplies	the	partial	URL	that	will invoke	the	script.	The	second	parameter	specifies	the	location	and	name	of	the WSGI	Python	script	to	be	run.	There	are	two	items	to	note	about	this	parameter. First,	the	location	specified	does	nothave	to	be	in	the	main	web	server	file system.	It	can	be	anywhere	on	your	file	system.	The	second	point	is	that	the   Python	script	can	be	named	anything	you	want	as	long	as	it	has	a.wsgi	extension. The	other	point	is	that	the	name	of	the	file	does	not	need	to	match	the	first parameter.	Again,	it	can	be	named	anything	you	want.	Our	example	used	the same	name	to	keep	things	simple,	but	you	do	not	have	to	follow	this	convention.  The	next	three	lines	configure	the	server	permissions	for	the	directory	where	the Python	script	resides.	The	permission	shown	will	need	to	be	specified	whether	or not	your	location	is	inside	the	web	server	file	system.  The	last	item	we	need	to	discuss	is	not	obvious	with	this	example.	You	can	have as	manyWSGIScriptAlias	lines	as	you	need.	These	may	all	use	the	same	location or	various	locations.	Just	remember	that	each	location	will	need	aDirectory specification	to	give	them	the	proper	permissions.  Once	you	have	a	complete	configuration	for	WSGI,	you	should	reboot	your server	to	make	it	active.	Now	we	need	to	create	a	test	Python	script	to	test	our configuration.	In	our	case,	we	need	to	create	thewgitest	directory	off	the	root	of the	web	server’s	main	file	system.	Now	we	need	to	create	our	wsgitest.wsgi script	file.	Ourwsgitest.wsgi	script	looks	something	like	Listing	5-1.  Listing	5-1.	wsgitest.wgsi	import	sys	import	os  def	application environ,	start_response :	status	=	'200	OK' output	=	'' output	+=	"sys.version	=	%s\n"	%	repr sys.version 	output	+=	"sys.prefix	= %s\n"	%	repr sys.prefix 	output	+=	"path	=	%s\n"	%	os.environ['PATH'] output	+=	"REQUEST_METHOD	=	%s\n"	%	environ['REQUEST_METHOD'] name	=	'SCRIPT_NAME' if	name	in	environ:  output	+=	name	+	"	=	%s\n"	%	environ[name] else: output	+=	name	+	"	=\n" name	=	'PATH_INFO' if	name	in	environ: output	+=	name	+	"	=	%s\n"	%	environ[name] else: output	+=	name	+	"	=\n" name	=	'QUERY_STRING' if	name	in	environ:   if	name	in	environ: output	+=	name	+	"	=	%s\n"	%	environ[name] else: output	+=	name	+	"	=\n" name	=	'CONTENT_TYPE' if	name	in	environ: output	+=	name	+	"	=	%s\n"	%	environ[name] else: output	+=	name	+	"	=\n" name	=	'CONTENT_LENGTH' if	name	in	environ: output	+=	name	+	"	=	%s\n"	%	environ[name] else: output	+=	name	+	"	=\n" output	+=	"SERVER_NAME	=	%s\n"	%	environ["SERVER_NAME"]	output +=	"SERVER_PORT	=	%s\n"	%	environ["SERVER_PORT"]	output	+= "SERVER_PROTOCOL	=	%s\n"	%	environ["SERVER_PROTOCOL"]	 v1,	v2  =	environ["wsgi.version"] output	+=	"wsgi.version	=	%s\n"	%	str v1 	+	'.'	+	str v2 	output	+= "wsgi.url_scheme	=	%s\n"	%	environ["wsgi.url_scheme"]	output	+= "wsgi.multithread	=	%s\n"	%	environ["wsgi.	multithread"] output	+=	"wsgi.multiprocess	=	%s\n"	%	environ["wsgi.	multiprocess"] output	+=	"wsgi.run_once	=	%s\n"	%	environ["wsgi.run_once"]  response_headers	=	[ 'Content-type',	'text plain' ,	 'Content-Length', str len output   ] start_response status,	response_headers   return	[output.encode 'utf-8' ]  There	are	a	few	items	we	need	to	discuss	about	this	listing.	First,	this	is	a	Python file,	but	there	is	no	! usr bin python	specification	at	the	top	of	the	file.	It	is	not needed	since	the	only	kind	of	file	a	WSGI	can	invoke	is	a	Python	script.	The next	thing	to	note	is	that	the	single	function	contained	in	the	file	is namedapplication.	This	is	the	one	and	only	function	name	that	will	be	invoked by	WSGI.	The	script	has	no	main	line	statements,	only	the	single	function.  The	main	body	of	the	function	creates	the	body	of	the	HTML	page.	In	our	case, we	are	just	returning	some	text,	so	we	don’t	enclose	that	in	any	kind	of	HTML formatting.   Next,	we	need	to	look	at	the	last	three	statements	of	the	function.	The	first statements	build	the	response	header	for	the	web	page.	In	a	lot	of	cases,	this	is placed	at	the	top	of	the	response	to	the	requestor.	WSGI	provides	functionality	to pass	the	necessary	response	headers	back	to	the	caller.	The	next	statement	calls that	functionality.	The	main	thing	to	note	is	that	we	are	supplying	the	length	of the	response.	Normally	we	do	not	fill	in	this	entry	because	we	are	responding with	an	HTML	file.	Since	ours	is	a	text	file,	we	need	to	explicitly	supply	this entry.	Otherwise,	the	web	browser	parser	will	not	be	able	to	determine	where	the file	ends.	If	it	were	HTML,	the	parser	would	stop	parsing	when	it	finds the 	tag.  The	last	line	returns	the	response	we	built	earlier	in	the	script.	Note	that	we	have to	encode	our	response.	This	is	a	weird	requirement	you	may	have	never	seen before.	But	WSGI	will	accept	only	encoded	responses,	not	plain	text.	Also,	note that	the	returned	response	is	enclosed	in	square	brackets	so	that	the	encoded string	is	returned	as	a	series	of	bytes.  Important	no	one	in	their	right	mind	creates	native	Wsgi	web	pages.	Wsgi	is	a foundation	for	other	systems	such	as	Flask,	django,	and	many	others.	the previous	example	is	only	a	simple	test	to	ensure	that	Wsgi	is	working	as designed.  You	can	run	this	script	with	the	following	URL	from	your	web	browser: http:  www.holmes4.com wsgitest  Just	substitute	your	web	server	name	and	WSGI	application	name	in	the previous	command. Figure	5-1	shows	the	output	from	the	Python	script	in	Listing	5-1.   Figure	5-1.	Output	from	the	wsgitest.wsgi	Python	application  The	web	page	in	Figure	5-1	gives	you	some	idea	of	the	available	environment entries	to	the	WSGI	script.	As	you	can	see,	it	is	pretty	limited	but	does	have some	useful	information.	The	Flask	environment	has	a	lot	of	additional	values available,	which	is	why	you	want	to	use	it	as	your	application	environment instead	of	native	WSGI.  Installing	and	Testing	Flask  Flask	is	a	Python	module	that	is	not	usually	available	in	your	operating	system’s repository.	You	must	install	it	yourself.	This	turns	out	to	be	easy	as	only	one command	is	needed	to	get	it	installed,	shown	here:  sudo	pip	install	flask  Beware,	if	you	do	not	install	it	as	root	or	do	not	use	the	sudo	prefix	command, the	library	will	be	installed	in usr local lib64 python3.8 	site-packages	on	Linux. Unfortunately,	this	location	is	not	available	to	programs	running	inside	the	web server,	so	Flask	is	not	available.	If	this	is	a	problem	for	you,	there	are	two choices	available.	You	can	copy	or	move	the	libraries	from	their	current	location to usr lib64 python3.8 	site-packagesor	you	can	create	links	to	the	packages	in   that	location.	One	thing	to	note	is	that	the	Python	version	in	the	previous	paths may	not	match	your	version	of	Python.	If	so,	then	just	change	the	path accordingly.	Windows	users	should	not	run	into	this	problem.  Once	the	installed	libraries	are	in	the	correct	directory,	the	install	is	complete.	To get	Flask	working,	you	need	to	perform	a	few	more	steps	in	Apache.  Just	as	we	needed	to	configure	WGI	for	use	by	Apache,	we	also	need	to	perform a	similar	step	for	Flask.	The	first	step	is	to	add	one	new	line	to	the	Apache configuration	file.  WSGIScriptAlias	 flasktest	 pub www holmes4 docroot wsgitest 	flasktest.wsgi  This	should	be	familiar	to	you	as	it	has	a	similar	format	to	the	WSGI	entry	in	the Apache	config	file.	Just	add	this	line	before	or	after	the	similar	WSGI	line.  Next,	we	need	to	create	the	flasktest.wsgi	file	specified	in	the	previous	line	at	the location	specified.	Listing	5-2	shows	what	should	go	into	that	file.  Listing	5-2.	The	flasktest.wsgi	File	Contents import	logging import	sys  logging.basicConfig stream=sys.stderr  sys.path.insert 0,	' pub www holmes4 docroot wsgitest ' 	from	flasktest	import app	as	application application.secret_key	=	'flask	test	on	apache	2.4'  As	you	can	see,	this	is	not	the	main	program.	This	is	some	setup	information	for your	real	Flask	application.	Thesys.path.insert  	function	is	where	our	real Python	program	is	located.	The	next	statement	imports	our	application	file	 still to	be	created 	and	the	function	it	uses.	The	last	line	registers	the	secret	key	for the	application.	This	string	can	be	anything	you	want	as	long	as	it	is	of	nonzero length.	We	use	a	short	description	of	the	Python	application	to	be	executed.	An examination	of	this	file	should	reveal	that	your	program	can	reside	anywhere. All	you	have	to	do	is	alter	the	location	in	thesys.path.insert  	statement.  One	thing	to	note	about	this	file	is	that	it	does	not	invoke	the	registered	function. Flask	does	that	for	you	for	the	same	reason	that	this	is	broken	up	between	two files.	It	protects	your	application	from	poisoning	the	Flask	environment	since	it is	called	from	Flask.	Your	program	will	have	its	own	variable	space	that	is	not   is	called	from	Flask.	Your	program	will	have	its	own	variable	space	that	is	not shared	with	Flask.  The	last	task	we	need	to	perform	is	to	create	our	actual	program.	Listing	5-3 shows	a	simple	test	program	that	we	will	use	to	ensure	that	Flask	is	operating correctly.  Listing	5-3.	The	flasktest.py	File	Contents	from	flask	import	Flask app	=	Flask 	name	  @app.route " "  def	hello  : return	"Hello	world!"	@app.route " second" 	def	hello2  : return	"Hello	second!"  Wow,	is	this	all	there	is?	Yes.	In	fact,	it	is	more	than	first	meets	the	eye.	There are	actually	two	executable	functions	included	that	can	be	invoked	from	the browser	command	line.	The	first	function	can	be	invoked	with	the	following browser	command:  http:  www.holmes4.com flasktest This	should	cause	the	returned"Hello	world!"string	to	appear	in	the	browser.	The second	function	can	be	invoked	as	follows: http:  www.holmes4 com flasktest second  This	should	cause	the	returned	"Hello	second!"	string	to	appear	in	the	browser.	If both	of	these	invocations	work,	then	you	have	successfully	created	your	first Flask	application.  The	URL	for	invoking	the	application	is	made	up	of	three	parts.	The	first	is	the name	of	the	web	server.	The	next	part	is	the	name	of	the	application	to	invoke. The	last	part	is	optional	and	specifies	a	different	function	to	be	invoked, thehello2function	in	our	case.	All	this	is	specified	by	the@app.route  	decorator that	precedes	each	function.	This	allows	you	to	have	multiple	functions contained	within	your	application,	all	available	from	theflasktest	base	name.	The decorator	supersedes	the	application	name	from	theflasktest.wsgi	file.  There	is	a	lot	of	power	provided	with	Flask	that	we	have	not	even	touched	on. Before	we	get	to	that,	I	will	show	you	how	to	build	a	nice	HTML	page	using Flask.	To	save	time,	I	will	show	that	some	CGI	programs	can	be	converted	to Flask	with	very	little	work.	To	do	that,	we	will	convert	Listing	3-8	to	run	under   The	only	changes	to	Listing	3-8	we	need	to	make	are	to	place	the	entire	program under	a	function	in	theflasktest.py	file.	That	makes	the	top	of	the	file	look	like the	following:  Flask.  from	flask	import	Flask import	os,	time,	string  app	=	Flask 	name	  @app.route " "  def	hello  :  return	"Hello	world!" @app.route " second"  def	hello2  : return	"Hello	second!" @app.route " pictures"  def	hello3  :  As	you	can	see,	we	just	added	a	new	function	to	contain	the	new	application. Next,	we	need	to	alter	the	code	that	obtains	theDOCUMENT_	ROOT.	This	CGI value	is	not	available	in	a	Flask	environment.	If	you	need	it	like	this	program does,	then	you	will	have	to	infer	it	from	the	location	of	the	Python	script.	Since the	location	of	our	Flask	program	is	inside	the	web	file	server	file	system,	we can	obtain	theDOCUMENT_ROOT	by	stripping	off	the	program	filename	and the	directory	that	contains	it	from	thefile	variable	to	give	us	the	root	location	of the	web	server	file	system.	The	following	code	fragment	shows	how	we accomplished	that:  	get	the	document	base	for	the	html_lib	directory  docroot,	tail 	=	os.path.split 	file	 		split	off	the	file	name  docroot,	tail 	=	os.path.split docroot 		split	off	the	first	directory html_lib_path	=	docroot	+	' html_lib '  The	last	change	we	need	to	make	is	to	the	last	statement	in	the	Python	script. Instead	of	writing	the	HTML	directly	to	the	browser	client,	we	return	it	to	Flask, and	in	turn	Flask	will	write	it	for	us.  	return	the	substituted	lines return	html   return	html  That	is	all	we	needed	to	change.	We	now	should	have	a	working	Flask	program that	has	the	same	functionality	and	display	graphics	of	the	original	CGI	program.  Warning	to	execute	the	program	from	the	browser,	you	will	first	have	to	restart your	web	server.	Otherwise,	Flask	will	not	know	there	is	a	new	function	in theflasktest.py	file.	the	reason	for	this	is	that	Flask	examines	each	file	registered via	the	WSGIScriptAlias	in	the	web	server	configuration	file	at	web	server startup.	if	you	add	a	new	python	function	to	a	file	controlled	by	Wsgi,	it	will	be unknown	until	you	restart	the	web	server.  Jinja2  Jinja2	is	a	Python	module	that	performs	text	substitution	in	almost	any	text	file. It	can	work	on	plain	ASCII,	HTML,	CSV,	and	practically	any	kind	of	text	file.	It is	just	one	member	of	a	family	of	text	substitution	frameworks	available	for Python.	All	of	these	frameworks	have	good	and	bad	points,	but	it	cannot	be denied	that	they	can	improve	your	application	development.	Jinja2	is	the	logical choice	for	Flask	because	it	is	installed	with	Flask.	Since	you	have	it	already,	you might	as	well	make	use	of	it.  The	idea	behind	a	text	substitution	framework	is	to	separate	the	display	parts	of your	program	from	the	code	logic.	This	is	a	modern	approach	to	software development.	Although	that	is	a	great	approach	when	developing	software, sometimes	practical	approaches	are	needed	to	actually	make	something	work. This	is	true	for	all	text	substitution	programs	that	try	to	do	more	than	just	simple text	substitution.  The	Python	string	module	does	simple	text	substitution,	swapping	one	value	for another.	We	used	this	in	the	CGI	examples	discussed	previously.	But	in	more complicated	situations	where	we	have	repeating	information,	we	need	a	more powerful	substitution	mechanism.	This	is	especially	true	with	database information	where	we	need	to	display	row	after	row	of	similar	data.	This	would be	hard	to	accomplish	with	a	simple	text	substitution	mechanism.	But	with	a more	powerful	mechanism,	we	can	actually	program	a	loop	in	the	source	file	to substitute	multiple	rows	from	a	database	table.	This	is	a	huge	productivity	tool for	that	type	of	data.   for	that	type	of	data.  But	to	start	with,	let’s	look	at	a	simple	text	substitution	mechanism	example. Listing 5-4 shows	the	combined	power	of	Flask	and	Jinja2. Listing	5-4.	A	Simple	Flask	and	Jinja2	Example	from	flask	import	Flask, render_template app	=	Flask 	name	   @app.route ' '  @app.route '  '  def	hello name=None :  return	render_template 'hello.html',	name=name   This	simple	program	has	a	lot	going	on,	most	of	which	is	not	really	obvious. First,	we	are	importing	an	additional	module	named	render_	template.	This	is	a Jinja2	module	that	takes	a	template	name	and	some	additional	parameters specifying	the	variables	and	values	to	be	used	for	substitution	in	the	template. This	is	shown	in	the	last	line	of	the	program.	But	you	may	be	asking,	“Where	is the	template?”	By	default,	the	Jinja2	template	is	located	in	a	subdirectory	named templates	just	under	the	directory	holding	the	program.	We	will	show	this template	in	Listing	5-5.  The	next	parts	are	the	two	decorator	statements	for	the	function.	The	first	one	is one	we	have	seen	before	and	requires	no	explanation.	The	second	decorator	has an	additional	strange	entry	inside	greater-than	and	less-than	symbols.	This specifies	that	thename	is	optional.	That	means	it	may	or	may	not	appear	in	the invocation	command.	Thus,	the	browser	command	line	may	have	one	of	the following	two	forms:  http:  www.holmes4.com jinjatest  http:  www.holmes4.com jinjatest David The	second	example	has	a	name	attached	to	the	end.	The	template  contains	logic	to	determine	if	thename	was	given	or	not	and	respond accordingly.  The	function	is	declared	so	that	the	name	has	a	default	value.	Ours	usesNone	as the	default	value,	but	we	could	have	specified	a	default	name.   the	default	value,	but	we	could	have	specified	a	default	name. The	last	statement	invokes	the	template	to	be	rendered	and	adds	extra	values needed	by	the	template	to	substitute	the	necessary	variables	in	the	template. So,	let’s	examine	the	template	so	we	can	see	how	this	all	fits	together.  Listing	5-5.	The	Simple	Flask	and	Jinja2	Example	Template     Hello	from	Flask  {%	if	name	%}   Hello	{{	name	}}!  {%	else	%}  Hello,	World!  {%	endif	%}  This	is	just	enough	HTML	to	show	how	all	this	functionality	works.	The statements	we	are	interested	in	are	the	ones	enclosed	with{%	...	%}.	These	are not	HTML;	instead,	they	are	instructions	to	Jinja2.	The	first	statement	tests	to see	whether	the	variablename	has	a	value	 besides	None .	If	it	does,	then	the following	HTML	statement	is	included	in	the	output.	The	next	Jinja2	statement is	theelse	part	of	the	test.	It	includes	the	subsequent	HTML	statement	if	theelse condition	is	true.	The	last	Jinja2	statement	ends	the	test	block.  Under	the	true	portion	of	the	Jinja2	block,	we	see	a	statement	enclosed	in{{ expression	}}.	This	contains	an	expression	that	will	be	evaluated	and	then included	in	the	output.  Figure 5-2	shows	the	output	sent	to	the	browser	when	a	name	is	included	on	the browser	command	line.   Figure	5-2.	Output	of	the	simple	Flask	and	Jenja2	example  As	you	can	see,	including	a	name	on	the	command	line	changes	the	output	from “Hello	World!”	to	“Hello	David!”	This	is	a	powerful	mechanism	that	allows	you to	use	a	single	HTML	page	for	all	users.  There	are	four	major	types	of	Jinja2	statements	available	to	you.	These	are	listed here:  {%	...	%}	For	statements	{{	...	}}	For	expressions	{	...	}	For	comments		...	 For	line	statement  Statements	are	similar	to	Python	statements.	We	will	see	an	example	of	this	kind of	statement	in	the	next	example. Expressions	are	similar	to	Python	expressions. Comment	statements	are	just	that,	comments.	They	will	not	be	included	in	the HTML	output. Line	statements	are	for	single-line	statements.	It	is	highly	recommended	that	you do	not	utilize	this	type	of	statement	because	it	is	usually	confusing	to	someone not	familiar	with	Jinja2. There	are	many	expressions	and	loops	that	can	be	created	with	Jinja2.	They	are all	documented	on	the	website	athttps:  jinja.	palletsproject.com en 2.11.x . Our	next	example	is	a	little	more	extensive	 Listing	5-6 .	It	shows	how	to display	the	results	of	a	database	query	when	the	total	number	of	output	lines	is unknown.	To	keep	things	simple,	the	actual	database	query	is	not	included,	only the	output.   Listing	5-6.	Database	Query	Display	Example  from	flask	import	Flask,	render_template from	jinja2	import	Template,	Environment,	PackageLoader,	select_autoescape import	os,	time  app	=	Flask 	name	   def	get_rows  : rows	=	list   rows	=	["DEPTNO	DEPTNAME	MGRNO	ADMRDEPT  LOCATION	", "	",	"A00	SPIFFY	COMPUTER	SERVICE	DIV.	000010	A00	-",	"B01 PLANNING	000020	A00	-",	"C01	INFORMATION	CENTER	000030	A00	-", "D01	DEVELOPMENT	CENTER	-	A00	-",	"D11	MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS	000060	D01	-",	"D21	ADMINISTRATION	SYSTEMS	000070	D01 -",	"E01	SUPPORT	SERVICES	000050	A00	-",	"E11	OPERATIONS	000090 E01	-",	"E21	SOFTWARE	SUPPORT	000100	E01	-",	"F22	BRANCH	OFFICE F2	-	E01	-",	"G22	BRANCH	OFFICE	G2	-	E01	-",	"H22	BRANCH	OFFICE	H2 -	E01	-",	"I22	BRANCH	OFFICE	I2	-	E01	-",	"J22	BRANCH	OFFICE	J2	-	E01 -",  "", "	14	record s 	selected."] return	rows  @app.route ' '  def	department name=None : 	create	the	substitutable	content pagedict	=	dict   title	=	'Table	Display' title1	=	'Department	Table' pagedict['title']	=	'Table	Display' titleleft	=	'Department	Table' asctime	=	time.asctime   parts	=	asctime.split   year	=	parts[4] rows	=	get_rows    	get	the	template	and	make	the	substitutions   	get	the	template	and	make	the	substitutions html	=	render_template 'jinjatest2.html',	rows=rows,	title=title,	\  titleleft=titleleft,	title1=title1,	year=year  	return	the	substituted	lines return	html  The	get_rows  function	returns	the	database	rows	to	be	displayed.	Normally	this would	include	a	query	and	row	fetching	from	the	database,	but	we	did	not	want to	clutter	up	the	listing	with	stuff	we	are	not	really	covering	with	this	book.  The	department  	function	is	our	main	function.	It	is	simple.	It	gathers	some substitution	variables	and	the	row	data.	It	then	calls	therender_	template  Jinja2 function	to	render	the	template.	Finally,	it	returns	the	rendered	HTML	to	Flask.  The	template	file	is	also	stored	in	the	templates	directory,	which	is	just	below	the directory	containing	the	Python	program. The	template	itself	is	similar	to	the	HTML	we	have	seen	before	except	for	the substitution	variables	 see	Listing	5-7 .  Listing	5-7.	HTML	Template	for	Listing	5-6   {{	title	}}                                image	by	W.David	Ashley           {{	title1	}} 	           {{	titleleft	}}       &nbsp;Home&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;Menu2&nbsp; &nbsp;	<a href=" ">&nbsp;Menu3&nbsp; &nbsp;	                   {%	for	row	in	rows	%}{{	rowe	}} {%	endfor	%}             &169;	Copyright	2010-{{	year	}}	W.	David	Ashley.	All	rights	reserved.        The	substitutable	variables	are	the	same	syntax	as	used	in	the	previous	example. However,	the	query	row	display	is	new	and	needs	explanation.	The expression{%	for	row	in	rows	%}	is	a	looping	expression.	It	loops	through	each row	of	data,	and	the	syntax	should	be	familiar	to	you	as	it	derives	from	Python. The	next	expression,{{	rowe	}},	displays	a	single	row	of	data	for	each	loop iteration.	The	next	expression,	{%	endfor	%},	ends	the	loop.  To	invoke	this	example,	use	the	following	browser	command:   http:  www.holmes4.com jinjatest2  This	command	will	produce	a	formatted	HTML	page	with	the	output	in	a	nice display. To	confirm	the	loop	works	as	expected,	the	output	to	the	browser	is	displayed	in Figure	5-3.  Figure	5-3.	Output	from	Listing	5-6	and	5-7  The	output	is	just	as	we	expected	it.	This	shows	the	real	power	of	Jinja2	where we	do	not	have	to	make	changes	to	the	program	or	the	HTML	to	accommodate variable	amounts	of	data	in	our	HTML	page.  There	are	one	or	two	“gotchas”	that	you	can	run	into	using	Jinja2.	First,	we	had to	hard-code	the	HTML	menus	into	the	HTML	page.	The	reason	for	this	is	that   to	hard-code	the	HTML	menus	into	the	HTML	page.	The	reason	for	this	is	that the	default	in	Jinja2	is	to	escape	any	text	substituted	into	the	document.	If	we tried	to	insert	HTML	tags	into	our	template,	then	they	would	be	escaped	 the	GT and	LT	symbols	would	be	replaced .	Thus,	our	menus	would	not	only	look strange,	they	would	not	work	at	all.	This	behavior	can	be	changed,	but	only globally.  The	other	point	has	to	do	with	the	display	of	the	lines.	You	should	note	that	the expressions	for	the	loop	all	appear	on	a	single	line	with	a	single tag	inside the	loop.	If	you	do	not	format	it	this	way,	you	will	invariably	get	blank	lines between	each	line	of	real	output.	All	the	documentation	for	this	loop	structure shows	each	instruction	on	separate	lines,	and	this	always	produces	unwanted extra	blank	lines	in	the	output.  Summary  The	combination	of	Flask	and	Jinja2	makes	a	wonderful	productivity	tool	for both	small	and	large	projects.	The	extensive	built-in	functions	and	formatting options	available	in	Jinja2	make	for	solutions	for	almost	every	problem	you	may encounter.	The	number	of	available	expressions	and	functions	available	with Jinja2	along	with	the	available	extensions	make	a	powerful	development environment	that	can	create	a	useful	web	interface.  However,	you	may	find	that	the	expressions	available	violate	some	aspects	of object-oriented	programming	 OOP ,	especially	the	principle	of	keeping	the display	of	data	separate	from	the	program	logic.	Having	expressions	within	the HTML	is	a	clear	violation	of	this	principle.  But,	if	you	can	live	with	these	drawbacks,	Flask	and	Jinja2	may	be	an	acceptable solution	for	your	situation.	I	urge	you	to	investigate	the websiteshttps:  palletsprojects.com p flask 	andhttps:   palletsprojects.com p jinja 	to	read	more	about	these	two	powerful	extensions	to Python.  CHAPTER	6 Django   Django	is	a	popular	web	development	environment	similar	to	Flask,	but	with some	differences.	The	differences	are	significant	in	some	circumstances.	For instance,	the	Django	APIs	are	a	complete	mechanism	for	managing	all	the	parts including	the	database	and	template	pieces.	Flask,	on	the	other	hand,	allows	you to	use	the	native	API	for	these	parts	and	thus	gives	you	more	choices	for	solving your	problems.	But	if	you	are	using	pieces	that	Django	supports,	then	this	is	the development	environment	you	will	want	to	use.  In	this	chapter,	I	will	highlight	the	differences	as	they	come	up.  Django	and	WSGI  Django	can	be	installed	usingpip	or	from	your	operating	system	repository. Thepip	command	is	shown	here: pip	install	django  This	will	install	the	latest	version	of	Django.	However,	this	may	not	be compatible	with	your	web	server	or	with	your	installed	version	of	WSGI.	Check before	you	install	something	so	you	don’t	have	to	replace	it	later.  It	is	highly	recommended	that,	if	possible,	you	install	Django	from	your operating	system	distribution	repository.	This	will	ensure	that	the	WSGI	and Django	versions	will	work	together.  Django	requires	some	changes	to	be	made	to	the	web	server	configuration	file. The	following	are	the	changes	that	need	to	be	added	to	the	configuration:  WSGIPythonPath	 pub www holmes4 mysite WSGIScriptAlias	 django	 pub www holmes4 mysite mysite mysite.wsgi    Require	all	granted    The	previous	statements	are	similar	to	the	statements	required	by	Flask.	The	first statement	points	to	the	place	where	your	Django	modules	are	stored.	Be	careful here,	because	theWSGIPythonPathstatement	can	go	only	in	the	web	server’s main	configuration.	It	cannot	appear	in	a	virtual	server	configuration	block.	This means	that	if	you	are	running	multiple	virtual	servers,	then	all	of	themmustshare   the	same	module	directory.	This	can	be	a	huge	problem	as	it	allows	code	to	be shared	across	websites.	So,	be	careful	in	your	planning	when	using	virtual	web servers	with	Django.  The	WSGIScriptAlias	statement	specifies	the	WSGI	configuration	file	for	your website.	This	file	should	never	change	in	most	cases.	It	tells	WSGI	the	name	of your	application,	which	is	usuallyapplication.  You	should	also	note	the	djangoname	added	to	the	root	of	the	script	alias.	What this	name	is	does	not	matter.	In	fact,	you	may	not	even	need	a	prefix	name	at	all. We	use	one	because	we	have	both	Flask	and	Django	applications	on	our	web server,	and	this	prevents	name	collisions	between	the	two	environments.  The	Directory	block	specifies	the	access	permissions	for	the	module	directory. This	is	especially	important	if	your	module	is	outside	the	base	web	server directory	of	files.  Nothing	needs	to	be	installed	on	the	web	server	for	Django.	Just	make	sure	that your	version	of	Django	is	compatible	with	the	version	of	WSGI	you	are	using.  Configuring	and	Testing	Django  While	you	can	use	the	Django	virtual	test	environment	to	create	your	site’s modules,	you	can	just	as	easily	create	it	by	hand.	If	this	is	your	first	Django application,	it	is	suggested	that	you	use	the	Django	virtual	environment	to	create your	first	module.	You	can	do	this	with	the	following	command:  django-admin.py	startproject	mysite  You	should	run	this	from	where	you	want	to	place	this	module.	Do	not	worry	too much	about	where	you	place	it,	as	you	will	move	it	to	its	permanent	location when	you	are	done.	When	the	command	finishes,	the	following	structure	should be	created	in	the	current	directory:  mysite manage.py mysite  init	.py asgi.py   asgi.py setting.py urls.py  The	mysite	directory	names	come	from	the	last	parameter	on	the	django- admin.py	command	line.	Feel	free	to	change	this	to	the	name	you	want	to	use	for your	module.  The	manage.py	file	is	a	command-line	administration	script	for	your	module site.	There	are	a	number	of	things	you	can	do	with	this	script.	Just	type	the	script name	without	any	parameters	on	the	command	line	to	discover	the	possible functions	available.  The	asgi.py	file	is	the	configuration	file	for	WSGI.	This	file	should	not	change except	in	extraordinary	circumstances.	In	any	case,	when	you	deploy	this module,	you	will	need	to	rename	the	file.	We	renamed	the	file	tomysite.wsgi when	we	deployed	it	for	production.	This	name	matches	what	we	used	in	the web	server	configuration	file	on	theWSGIScriptAlias	statement	in	the	previous section.  The	settings.py	file	has	the	settings	to	be	used	for	this	module.	Some	of	these settings	will	need	to	be	modified	when	you	deploy	the	module	to	the	web	server.  The	urls.py	file	is	important.	Every	time	you	create	a	new	function	to	be	called from	the	browser	command	line,	you	will	need	to	add	a	new	line	to	this	file.	This file	matches	a	name	on	the	browser	to	a	function	to	be	called.	This	is	different from	Flask,	which	requires	aWSGIScriptAlias	statement	for	every	function	to	be called	in	the	module.	This	places	that	functionality	inside	a	single	Python	file	so that	it	does	not	clutter	up	the	web	server	configuration	file.	And	it	prevents modifying	the	web	server	configuration	file	every	time	you	want	to add delete modify	a	function	in	the	Django	module.  To	test	our	configuration,	we	need	to	build	the	classic	“Hello	World”	function	so it	can	be	displayed	by	the	browser.	The	first	file	we	need	is	the	Python	file containing	our	callable	function	 Listing	6-1 .  Listing	6-1.	The	views.py	File from	django.http	import	HttpResponse def	hello request : return HttpResponse "Hello	World!"     Since	this	is	just	a	test,	our	script	is	simple.	We	just	want	to	make	sure	that	a remote	browser	can	connect	and	display	the	results	of	thehello	function.  Next,	we	need	to	let	the	server	know	where	the	function	resides.	That	is	done	in theurls.py	file.	The	original	contents	of	the	file	are	displayed	in	Listing	6-2,	and following	it	are	our	modifications.  Listing	6-2.	The	Original	Contents	of	the	urls.py	File """mysite	URL	Configuration The	`urlpatterns`	list	routes	URLs	to	views.

The	following	line	is	needed	so	we	can	tell	Python where	ourhello	function	is	and	how	the	URL	for	the	browser	is	to	be	formed:  path 'hello ',	hello ,  The	first	parameter	to	the	path	method	is	our	URL	modifier.	The	name	here	can be	different	from	the	function	name,	which	is	the	second	parameter.	The	URL for	invoking	the	function	will	look	something	like	the	following	example:  http:  www.holmes4.com django hello  You	should	note	how	we	have	to	add	the	django 	prefix	we	specified	in	the	web server	configuration.	Again,	we	add	this	prefix	to	prevent	name	collisions between	Django	and	Flask	on	our	web	server.	The	second	name,	hello, corresponds	to	the	first	parameter	in	the	previous	path	function.  Just	as	important	is	the	second	modification	to	theurls.pyfile	that	we	made. from	mysite.views	import	hello  This	line	instructs	Python	on	the	location	of	the	hellofunction.	Without	this	line, Python	will	not	be	able	to	locate	the	second	parameter	on	thepath	function.   Python	will	not	be	able	to	locate	the	second	parameter	on	thepath	function.  The	next	file	we	need	to	modify	is	thesettings.py	file.	For	this	example,	there	are only	two	lines	that	need	to	be	changed.	The	following	line:	DEBUG	=	True should	be	changed	to	this: DEBUG	=	False This	will	force	the	web	server	to	present	the	normal	error	messages	you	would expect	and	log	them	in	the	servererror_log. The	next	line:	ALLOWED_HOSTS	=	[]  should	be	modified	so	that	it	contains	at	least	three	entries	in	quotes	separated	by commas.	The	first	entry	should	be	the	web	server’s	IP	address.	The	second	entry should	be	the	web	server’s	DNS	name.	The	third	entry	should	be	the	remote client’s	IP	address.	You	can	also	include	an	additional	client	IP	address	or	a range	of	addresses.  At	this	point,	you	should	restart	your	web	server	just	to	make	sure	that everything	has	been	recorded	by	WSGI.	Once	that	is	done,	enter	the	URL command	shown	earlier	in	your	browser.

The	output	from	the	hello	command Congratulations,	you	have	built	your	first	Django	application!  Django	and	Templates   Our	next	example	Django	application	is	the	same	as	the	Flask	application	we built.	We	are	building	this	same	application	to	show	how	applications	built	with Django	are	similar	to	those	built	with	Flask.	In	fact,	the	templates	in	Django	are similar	to	those	in	Flask.

There	is	the	function	that	returns	the	rows	from	the	department we	want	to	display	plus	code	to	set	the	variables	containing	the	information	we want	to	display.	Finally,	there	is	code	to	fetch	the	HTML	template,	substitute	the variables	into	the	template,	and	then	return	the	finalized	HTML.	The	main change	here	is	that	Django	templates	expect	only	a	single	Python	dictionary rather	than	a	list	of	values	as	separate	parameters.  As	for	the	template,	you	will	find	that	at	first	glance	it	is	exactly	like	the	Flask template.	While	it	is	true	the	two	template	systems	are	similar,	there	are differences.	The	Django	template	appears	as	shown	in	Listing	6-6.  Listing	6-6.

David	Ashley.	All	rights	reserved.          Take	a	close	look	for	the	single	difference	in	this	template.	It	is	in	the	line	that prints	out	each	row	of	the	department	data.	The	previous	Flask	template	used	{{ rowe	}}	to	print	each	row	of	department	data.	The	Django	template	eliminates part	of	that	expression.	Thee	part	of	the	statement	used	in	the	Flask	template	is	a filter	to	help	print	an	expression	that	has	no	characters	associated	with	it.	The Django	template	does	not	need	this	expression.	This	is	just	one	of	the	small “gotcha”	differences	between	the	two	template	systems.   “gotcha”	differences	between	the	two	template	systems.  Just	to	prove	the	two	systems	can	produce	the	same	output,	we	will	show	you that	output.	See	Figure 6-2.  Figure	6-2.	Output	from	the	getdepartment  	function  The	command	we	used	was	as	follows: http:  www.holmes4.com.django hello getdepartment   The	output	is	the	same	for	both	the	Flask	and	Django	systems.	Only	the command	is	different.	So,	why	use	one	system	over	the	other?	For	that	answer, please	continue	to	the	next	chapter.   Using	a	Database	with	Django  This	book	is	about	dynamic	web	pages,	but	it	is	worth	spending	a	little	time	with Django’s	support	of	multiple	databases.	Django	supports	a	number	of	databases including	SQLite,	PostgreSQL,	MySQL,	Oracle,	and	Microsoft	SQL	in Windows.	There	are	other	packages	available	to	support	other	databases	such	as IBM	DB2.	But	for	our	purposes,	it	is	not	what	databases	are	supported	by Django;	it	is	the	way	they	are	supported.  Much	about	database	support	in	Django	is	surrounded	by	a	library.	It	also assumes	in	a	large	way	that	you	are	working	in	concert	with	a	database	admin	to design	the	database	for	your	purposes.	This	also	means	that	changes	to	the database	design	can	be	made	during	the	implementation	of	the	application	you are	working	on.	Unfortunately,	this	is	not	the	way	it	works	in	the	real	world.	In most	situations,	you	will	be	stuck	with	a	database	design	that	cannot	be	changed because	those	changes	will	require	other	applications	to	accommodate	those changes.	This	obviously	will	not	happen	in	the	real	world.  So,	what	are	your	options?	There	are	two	obvious	solutions:	use	the	database design	as	is	or	create	a	new	database	that	is	a	copy	of	the	information	in	the	real database.	The	second	option	is	full	of	problems	having	to	do	with	maintaining	a copy	of	the	data.	Choosing	the	first	option	actually	introduces	a	new	set	of options.	You	may	choose	to	not	utilize	Django’s	database	support	at	all	and instead	use	a	more	native	SQL	support	mechanism	to	access	the	database.	The problem	with	this	choice	is	that	you	will	be	leaving	behind	all	the	advantages that	using	Django’s	support	will	provide	you	and	substituting	a	whole	new	code base	that	has	separate	support.  At	this	point,	you	may	be	asking	yourself	why	you	are	using	Django	in	the	first place.	If	proper	database	access	is	a	stumbling	point	for	your	application,	then you	may	need	to	rethink	your	solution.	Whether	or	not	you	choose	Django	as part	of	your	solution,	just	make	sure	that	your	solution	makes	sense	for	your immediate	needs	as	well	as	your	future	needs.	Careful	planning	on	the	front	end will	make	a	huge	difference	in	the	amount	of	work	necessary	in	implementing your	solution. Summary  This	chapter	introduced	Django	as	a	dynamic	HTML	page	mechanism.	This   This	chapter	introduced	Django	as	a	dynamic	HTML	page	mechanism.	This mechanism	can	be	used	with	or	without	a	backend	database.	The	template library	used	by	Django	is	similar	to	the	one	used	by	Flask,	so	very	little	training will	be	necessary	to	switch	from	one	template	system	to	the	other.  If	you	are	going	to	use	a	database	with	Django,	pay	careful	attention	to	the	kind of	database	support	Django	offers	as	it	may	or	may	not	be	what	you	need	in	the short	or	long	run.  CHAPTER	7 Comparing	CGI,	SSI,	Flask,	and Django  In	this	chapter,	we	will	compare	all	the	dynamic	HTML	page	creation	tools introduced	so	far.	Each	system	has	strengths	and	weaknesses	and	should	be chosen	with	care.	This	will	make	it	a	lot	easier	to	choose	the	system	that	fits your	requirements.  In	the	discussions	in	this	chapter,	I	will	try	to	be	as	fair	as	possible.	Obviously,	I have	my	own	preferences,	but	I	will	let	the	strengths	of	each	system	speak	for themselves.	When	comparing	the	systems,	do	not	let	a	single	topic	category sway	your	decision	without	also	looking	into	the	other	categories.	As	much	as you	may	like	a	single	strength	of	a	system,	sometimes	the	weaknesses	can	far outweigh	the	downsides	for	your	situation. Installation	and	Configuration  In	this	section,	I	will	discuss	the	installation	and	configuration	for	each	dynamic HTML	system.	The	advantages	and	problems	we	discovered	will	be	discussed	at length.  CGI	Installation	and	Configuration  With	most	web	servers,	the	CGI	environment	is	installed	by	default.	You	only have	to	create	your	CGI	scripts programs,	and	you	are	off	and	running.	There may	be	some	configuration	necessary	to	get	your	preferred	script	environment   may	be	some	configuration	necessary	to	get	your	preferred	script	environment working	under	CGI,	such	as	adding	anAddHandler	web	server	directive	to enable	your	Python	environment.  Of	course,	when	using	Python,	the	choice	of	a	database	is	pretty	wide	open.	The only	caveat	is	that	once	you	pick	a	database	access	method,	you	are	pretty	much stuck	with	it	for	the	long	term.	You	should	carefully	pick	your	database	access method	so	that	it	will	not	become	an	issue	later.  You	can	still	use	the	method	we	discussed	in	Chapter	2	to	split	the	parts	of	your HTML	pages	into	chunks	that	can	be	put	together	again	dynamically.	This should	make	it	easier	to	create	a	multitude	of	HTML	pages	by	putting	together the	different	parts	of	your	page	without	recoding	it	from	scratch.  SSI	Installation	and	Configuration  SSI	is	not	usually	configured	by	default	in	most	web	servers.	You	will	need	to add	the	proper	configuration	directives	for	SSI	before	it	can	be	used.	But	once that	is	done,	it	opens	up	a	wide	variety	of	ways	that	SSI	can	be	used.	This includes	adding	dynamic	text	to	your	HTML	pages	and	even	calling	your	own scripts	to	completely	create	the	entire	page	or	just	a	piece	of	it.  Your	database	access	method	is	still	wide	open	when	using	SSI.	The	same precautions	apply	for	SSI	as	for	CGI	programs	when	it	comes	to	database	access.  Splitting	an	HTML	page	is	still	possible	when	utilizing	SSI	and	can	offer	some benefits	without	adding	a	performance	hit	to	your	pages.  Flask	Installation	and	Configuration  Flask	can	usually	be	installed	using	either	your	operating	system	repository	or the	Python	pip	command.	If	available,	installing	it	from	the	operating	system repository	is	preferably	so	that	it	can	be	updated	when	the	rest	of	the	operating system	is	updated.	Otherwise,	you	will	be	stuck	manually	ensuring	that	your version	of	Python	is	compatible	with	the	version	of	Flask	you	are	using.  Flask	will	also	require	a	fair	amount	of	configuration	to	enable	its	use	with	your web	server.	But	once	you	have	your	first	script	working,	subsequent	scripts	will be	much	easier	to	configure.  Your	database	access	method	is	also	wide	open	when	using	Flask.	Just	be	sure   Your	database	access	method	is	also	wide	open	when	using	Flask.	Just	be	sure that	your	choice	will	not	have	an	adverse	impact	in	the	future. While	it	is	possible	to	split	your	HTML	pages	into	multiple	pieces	under	Flask, it	will	be	a	little	harder	to	submit	that	page	to	the	Jinja2	system	for	variable substitution.	It	can	be	done,	but	you	will	need	to	look	up	the	process	for managing	that	submission.  Django	Installation	and	Configuration  Django	can	also	be	installed	using	either	an	operating	system	repository	or	the Pythonpip	command.	If	the	option	is	available,	installing	it	from	the	operating system	repository	is	preferable	so	that	it	can	be	updated	when	the	rest	of	the operating	system	is	updated.	Otherwise,	you	will	be	stuck	with	manually ensuring	that	your	version	of	Python	is	compatible	with	the	version	of	Django you	are	using.  Django	also	requires	a	fair	amount	of	configuration	to	enable	its	use	with	your web	server.	But	once	you	have	your	first	script	working,	subsequent	scripts	will be	much	easier	to	configure.  Database	access	with	Django	is	somewhat	limited	to	what	Django	can	support directly.	You	must	also	have	permission	from	your	database	admin	to	modify	the database	as	needed	by	Django.	This	will	be	easy	if	you	are	setting	up	a	new database,	but	much	harder	if	you	will	be	accessing	an	existing	database.  As	far	as	splitting	your	HTML	pages	into	different	parts,	it	will	be	a	little	harder to	submit	those	pages	for	processing	by	Django’s	page	parser.	But	it	can	be	done if	you	are	careful. Python	Usage  All	of	the	products	we	have	utilized	in	this	book	use	the	Python	language.	But, does	a	system	use	Python	to	its	advantage,	or	does	the	language	get	in	the	way	of accomplishing	your	goal?	This	section	will	examine	this	aspect	to	see	how	well Python	is	used	in	each	product.  CGI	Python	Usage  We	made	some	use	of	Python	in	CGI	scripts	to	break	apart	HTML	skeletons	and then	put	them	back	together	again	to	make	the	best	use	of	the	HTML	and	CSS   then	put	them	back	together	again	to	make	the	best	use	of	the	HTML	and	CSS frameworks.	This	allowed	us	to	create	customized	HTML	pages	for	use	in different	parts	of	our	website	for	different	purposes.	The	ease	of	putting	the HTML	parts	back	together	with	Python	allowed	for	very	dynamic	page	designs with	little	effort	on	our	part.  Another	useful	feature	was	using	Python’s	library	to	create	small	dynamic portions	for	the	HTML	page	 like	the	copyright	year 	that	allowed	the	page	to dynamically	change	without	any	update	to	the	page	by	an	editor.	This	kept	the number	of	updates	to	a	page	to	a	reasonable	number	and	allowed	us	to concentrate	on	the	page	information	content	and	not	the	minutiae.  SSI	Python	Usage  SSI	can	be	a	strange	beast	to	work	with.	On	the	one	hand,	it	supplies	some	nice capabilities;	on	the	other,	it	limits	us	in	how	we	can	put	an	HTML	page	together. Python	does	not	help	much	with	this	because	using	it	to	deliver	the	page	itself eliminates	the	usage	of	any	SSI	capabilities.	However,	SSI	can	give	us	one capability	not	available	to	CGI.	When	a	Python	script	is	invoked	via	the	standard CGI	mechanism,	the	current	directory	is	always	the	CGI	directory.	By	using	SSI to	invoke	a	CGI	script,	the	script	inherits	the	directory	where	the	HTML SSI page	was	originally	located.	This	can	be	useful	if	the	script	needs	to	utilize	the contents	of	that	directory	to	display	a	list	of	files.	But	the	new	HTML	page	will lose	the	ability	to	be	parsed	by	SSI.  However,	you	may	still	find	a	limited	use	for	SSI,	and	I	encourage	you	to	make use	of	it	where	feasible	to	do	so.  Flask	Python	Usage  Flask	makes	use	of	Python	to	a	great	extent	—so	much	so	that	your	script	is usually	just	setting	some	variables	that	will	later	be	used	by	the	HTML	page template	processor.	This	tends	to	make	your	main	Python	program	small	and efficient.	The	one	drawback	is	that	a	Flask	program	is	like	a	CGI	program	in	that the	script	always	has	the	same	current	directory	inherited	from	the	Flask environment.	Thus,	a	Flask	script	cannot	make	use	of	any	of	the	files	in	the	web server’s	file	system.  It	also	can	be	a	little	harder	to	break	apart	your	HTML	files	and	dynamically	put them	back	together	again	before	submitting	them	to	the	template	processor.	This   them	back	together	again	before	submitting	them	to	the	template	processor.	This task,	while	not	impossible,	is	harder	to	accomplish	because	all	the	page	parts must	be	located	within	the	Flask	file	system.	This	may	or	may	not	mean	that your	parts	library	is	inside	the	web	server’s	file	system.	It	will	depend	on	how you	have	located	the	Flask	environment	directory.  Django	Python	Usage  Django	also	make	great	use	of	Python.	It	is	similar	to	Flask	in	that	most	of	your script	will	be	setting	Python	variables	for	use	later	by	the	Django	template processor.	Django	is	also	similar	to	Flask	in	that	your	scripts	will	always	have the	same	current	directory,	which	is	inherited	from	the	Django	environment. Thus,	Django	cannot	make	use	of	any	files	in	the	web	server’s	file	system.  The	same	limitation	is	also	true	for	breaking	apart	your	HTML	pages	and dynamically	putting	them	back	together	again.	This	task,	while	not	impossible,	is harder	to	accomplish	because	all	the	page	parts	must	be	located	within	the Django	file	system. Template	Processing  Perhaps	the	feature	most	used	when	dynamically	producing	HTML	pages	is some	sort	of	template	processor.	There	are	actually	a	number	of	these	facilities available	in	Python,	and	any	of	them	can	be	used.	It	is	even	possible	to	use Django’s	template	system	with	Flask,	and	vice	versa.	Template	systems	tend	to just	be	Python	modules,	so	you	could	install	the	system	of	your	choice	and	use	it for	your	HTML	output.  CGI	Template	Processing  The	CGI	system	was	born	long	before	the	first	Python	template	processor.	Thus, most	existing	CGI	systems	process	their	own	HTML	dynamically	via	the	CGI script.	But	if	CGI	is	your	choice	for	a	dynamic	HTML	environment,	there	is nothing	to	stop	you	from	using	a	modern	Python	template	system	to	help	you create	dynamic	HTML	pages.	Just	make	sure	your	choice	of	a	template processor	matches	your	system	requirements.  SSI	Template	Processing   In	a	word,	stop.	It	is	not	possible	to	use	a	template	system	if	you	have	SSI directives	in	your	HTML	page.	The	SSI	directives	will	be	ignored	because	the SSI	processor	will	be	bypassed.  Flask	Template	Processing  Flask	has	a	powerful	template	processor.	It	has	lots	of	features	and	capabilities. In	fact,	there	are	so	many	features	that	you	will	probably	never	utilize	even	half of	them.	Just	keep	in	mind	that	if	you	run	across	a	formatting	problem,	you should	first	check	out	the	template	system	before	you	use	Python	or	create HTML	to	solve	the	problem.  Django	Template	Processing  The	Django	template	processor	is	slightly	different	from	the	Flask	processor,	but it	has	more	similarities	than	differences,	and	it	is	usually	not	too	hard	for someone	to	switch	from	one	system	to	the	other.	Just	as	with	Flask,	keep	in	mind that	if	you	run	across	a	formatting	problem,	you	should	first	check	out	the template	system	before	you	use	Python	or	create	HTML	to	solve	the	problem.  Database	Access  While	not	strictly	covered	in	this	book,	this	subject	is	worth	covering	here because	it	can	have	a	profound	impact	on	your	problem	solution.	In	fact,	most dynamic	HTML	systems	are	created	strictly	to	process	database	actions.	So	if you	choose	the	wrong	database	access	method,	the	impact	can	be	severe	in	both problem	solution	development	and	database	access	response.  One	thing	to	always	remember	is	that	a	database	can	hold	many	types	of	data,	be organized	differently	than	others	of	the	same	data,	and	may	require	specialized methods	to	obtain	appropriate	response	times.	It	may	take	some	experimenting to	find	an	access	method	that	has	the	capabilities	and	provides	response	times suitable	for	your	situation.	Do	not	be	afraid	to	put	in	some	up-front	time	on	this choice	because	it	can	save	you	a	lot	of	time	on	later	during	the	development process	by	eliminating	surprises.  Rest	APIs  Django	has	one	advantage	not	offered	by	any	of	the	other	systems:	Rest	APIs.   Django	has	one	advantage	not	offered	by	any	of	the	other	systems:	Rest	APIs. The	Django	Rest	Framework	 DRF 	is	used	extensively	throughout	the	industry to	increase	the	efficiency	and	response	to	the	database.	The	framework	is	easy	to use	and	quite	efficient	at	decreasing	the	response	time	for	queries	to	the	database system.	Of	course,	these	can	be	added	to	any	system	we	have	discussed,	but	the bult-in	APIs	in	Django	offer	an	easyto-use	framework	automatically	available with	Django.  Summary  Each	system	we	discussed	has	great	features	and	some	drawbacks.	Most	of	the drawbacks	have	to	do	with	whether	a	feature	can	solve	your	problem.	If	Django does	not	support	your	database,	then	there	are	strong	reasons	to	select	another system.	Whatever	system	you	choose	will	have	some	features	that	are	hard	to distinguish	from	a	feature	in	another	system,	such	as	the	Django	and	Flask template	systems.  It	will	be	worth	your	time	to	choose	a	system	carefully.	It	will	pay	big	dividends in	the	end.
