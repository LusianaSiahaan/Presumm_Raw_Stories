The  more information you have at your disposal and the more hands-on experi- ence you gain, the better off you will be when attempting to pass the exam.  This study guide was written with that in mind. We have utilized a variety of  valid resources to explicitly define all characteristics associated with the  exam objectives. We attempted to dispense as much information as we could  about servlet and JSP web components so that you will be prepared for the  test—but not so much that you will be overloaded. This book is arranged in  a format that follows the Sun-specified exam objectives. If you need to con- centrate on a particular objective, you will find everything you need within  the chapter on which the objective is based.  This book presents the technical material at an intermediate level. You  should be experienced with the Java language and have passed the Sun Cer- tified Programmer for the Java 2 Platform exam. You should also have  some experience with servlets or Java Server Pages. If you do not, it is still  possible to acquire the knowledge necessary to pass the exam by using this  book. You will, however, need to study each chapter thoroughly and write  practice code to ensure you thoroughly understand each concept. Although  some of the objectives have one-word answers, keep in mind that the exam  might ask any question surrounding the information related to the topic.  The book is written in a way that discusses all topics that are relevant to a  specific objective.   Several practice exams are provided to test your knowledge level as you  study. If you can answer 80 percent or more of the review questions correctly  for a given chapter, you can probably feel safe moving on to the next chapter.  If you’re unable to answer that many correctly, reread the chapter and try the  questions again. Your score should improve.   just study the questions and answers—the questions on the actual   Don’t exam will be different from the practice ones included in this book and on the  CD. The exam is designed to test your knowledge of a concept or objective, so  use this book to learn the objective    the question.  behind                                               xviii  Why Become a Sun Certified Programmer?  What Is the Sun Certified Web Component  Developer for J2EE ™   Certification?  B  usinesses are often intrigued and interested in incorporating new tech- nologies to improve their existing systems. However, because the technologies  are fairly new, it is difficult for developers to prove their level of competence  in the desired area. A thorough understanding of the rules associated with  web component development can ensure an employer that you can begin  developing these components to provide a successful web solution for their  applications. Those programmers who successfully complete the exam can  be assured that their certification is respected in the computer industry, as it  tests your knowledge on the basic fundamentals and the ability to utilize  these web components in an advanced fashion.  Now that J2EE technologies are accepted in the computer industry as pro- viding an enterprise-level solution to robust systems, it is critical that Java  programmers understand the key components that drive this architecture to  the web user. With each layer managing distinct tasks, the design offers  expandability, maintainability, and flexibility, to name a few; and servlets  and JSPs are the foundation components used to communicate with the front  end of the application. Becoming a Sun certified web component developer  proves to companies that you not only know of the technologies and their  techniques, but that you are proficient in understanding when and how to  use servlets and JSPs within a J2EE architecture.   T   cid:1    cid:1    cid:1    cid:1    cid:1   here are a number of reasons for becoming a Sun certified web   component developer:  It demonstrates proof of professional achievement.  It increases your marketability.  It provides greater opportunity for advancement in your field.  It is increasingly found as a requirement for some types of advanced  training.  It raises customer confidence in you and your company’s services.  Let’s explore each reason in detail.  Why Become a Sun Certified Programmer?                          Why Become a Sun Certified Programmer?  xix  Provides Proof of Professional Achievement  Specialized certifications are the best way to stand out from the crowd. In  this age of technology certifications, you will find thousands of programmers  who have successfully completed the Sun Certified Programmer for the Java 2  Platform exam. This level of certification proves you understand the funda- mentals. To set yourself apart from the crowd, you need a little bit more.  With Java finally making an impact on the web user, a developer must prove  that their skill set expands beyond the fundamentals and encompasses web  development.   The Sun Certified Web Component Developer for J2EE Platform exam  is either the second or third level of Java certification. After you pass the  Sun Certified Programmer for Java 2 Platform, you are eligible to either  take the Sun Certified Developer for Java 2 Platform exam or the Sun  Certified Web Component Developer for the J2EE Platform exam. The  standard developer exam consists of a programming assignment, along  with an essay. The web component exam is a multiple choice test to deter- mine your understanding of servlets and JSPs within a J2EE architecture.  Each level of certification further solidifies your credibility and knowledge  in this competitive programming market. J2EE certification will give you  the recognition you deserve.  Increases Your Marketability  Almost anyone can bluff their way through an interview. After you have cer- tified on a product such as the Sun Certified Web Component Developer for  the J2EE Platform, you will have the credentials to prove your competency.  And certifications are not something that can be taken from you when you  change jobs. Once certified, you can take that certification with you to any  of the positions you accept.  Provides Opportunity for Advancement  Those individuals who prove themselves as competent and dedicated are the  ones who will most likely be promoted. Becoming certified is a great way to  prove your skill level and shows your employers that you are committed  to improving your skill set. Look around you at those who are certified.  They are probably the ones who receive good pay raises and promotions  when they come up.                                      xx  How to Become a Sun Certified Programmer  Fulfills Training Requirements  Many companies have set training requirements for their staff so that they  stay up-to-date on the latest technologies. Having a certification program for  the Java family of products provides developers another certification path to  follow when they have exhausted some of the other industry-standard certi- fications.  Raises Customer Confidence  As companies discover the J2EE architectural advantage, they will undoubt- edly require qualified staff to implement this technology. Many companies  outsource the work to consulting firms with experience working with J2EE  web components. Those firms that have certified staff have a definite advan- tage over other firms that do not.

One must be a photo ID, such as a  driver’s license. The other can be a major credit card or a passport.  Both forms must contain a signature.   cid:1  Arrive early at the exam center so you can relax and review your study   materials, particularly tables and lists of exam-related information.   cid:1  Read the questions carefully. Don’t be tempted to jump to an early   conclusion. Make sure you know exactly what the question is asking.   cid:1  Don’t leave any unanswered questions. Unanswered questions are   scored against you.   cid:1  There will be questions with multiple correct responses. When there is  more than one correct answer, a message at the bottom of the screen  will prompt you to “Choose all that apply.” Be sure to read the  messages displayed.   cid:1  When answering multiple-choice questions you’re not sure about, use  a process of elimination to get rid of the obviously incorrect answers  first. This will improve your odds if you need to make an educated  guess.   cid:1  On form-based tests, because the hard questions will eat up the most  time, save them for last. You can move forward and backward through  the exam.  When the exam becomes adaptive, this tip will not work.    xxxii About the Authors  About the Authors   cid:1  For the latest pricing on the exams and updates to the registration pro- cedures, call Sun Microsystems at  800  422-8020.

When a request object is triggered within a form, its hidden values  are stored within the actual request object. Using the ServletRequest’s  method getParameter String name , you can extract the hidden  value by passing its name to the method.   2. C.  The HttpServletRequest class contains the path information  containing the session ID. The method getPathInfo   returns the  path information listed after the servlet path and before the query  string.  3. D.  A session can exist beyond the client. To manually discard a   session, you must call invalidate  —not close  . Hidden values  are useful only if you can propagate the values through dynamic pages.  After a static page is used, hyperlinks or browser triggers are the only  way to navigate. Those options do not allow for the inclusion of hid- den values. However, if the site is configured to use cookies for session  management, the session may continue, and using hidden values will  not result in the removal of the session. Finally, a session can time out,  resulting in the removal of the session object.  4. B.  To extract a rewritten URL, the HttpServletRequest class is   used. To rewrite the URL by using provided methods, you must use  the HttpServletResponse class.  5. A.  When redirecting a response, the encodeRedirectURL …  method  should be used to encode the current session ID in the URL. Because a  redirect URL is stored differently than a normal URL, you must use  a different method to generate the appropriate URL output.  6. D.  The specification states that the name associated to the session  value must be jsessionid. For cookies, the session name is written  with all capitals; however, for URL rewriting, the specification  SRV.7.1.3 states that the name must be written with lowercase letters.   7. E.  Cookies are data objects written to the response object and stored  on the browser. They can be retrieved by using the request object.  Cookies can also be added as an attribute to the session object or writ- ten to a database. A session object acts like a storage unit. It can contain  data from cookies or URL rewriting. URL rewriting is a way to store  the session ID. The ID can then be linked to any resource that allows  data to be stored. Finally, hidden values can be accessed via the  request object.   Answers to Assessment Test  li  8. C.  When an attribute is unbound from a session, an HttpSession  BindingEvent is generated and sent to all registered Http SessionBindingListeners via the valueUnbound …  method.  9. A.  A class that implements the interface HttpSessionListener  must define the method sessionDestroyed  HttpSessionEvent  event . This method is then called when a session is invalidated.  10. D.  When the session-time value is set within the deployment descrip- tor, it is defined using minutes. There is no tag available to change that  time measurement to any other value. For granular control using  seconds, you can set the maximum inactive period by using the session  object.  11. A, D.  Local variables and method parameters are stored on the stack.  Because each thread is provided its own stack, there are no threading  issues to be concerned with, in regard to these variables.  12. D.  Synchronized code blocks are usually encouraged to ensure the   integrity of instance variables. Their use, however, can cause an increase  of resources, because the system needs to transfer the lock between  threads. In addition, locking code causes a reduction in performance as  other threads must wait for the lock. Finally, deadlock can result from  locking too much information.  13. D.  Class variables are shared among all instances of a servlet.   Because the server can create a new servlet instance for each registered  name, the instance variable is handled differently than the class vari- able. The instance variable is accessed each time a particular instance  is used, whereas the class variable is accessed each time any instance  of that servlet is used. Because more than one thread can access a class  variable at a time, it too is not thread-safe.  14. D.  Request attributes are tied to the request object and managed by  the RequestDispatcher to ensure that each request is assigned to  a separate thread. Session attributes act in a similar way. They are  assigned to each client through the request object, and threading is  handled internally. Consequently, there is no need to worry about  threading issues. Finally, context attributes are safe assuming the  setAttribute …  method is synchronized. Usually it is, so context  attributes are almost always thread-safe.    lii Answers to Assessment Test  15. C.  Because a container can pool many instances of the same servlet,  each thread can access a different instance and utilize any service …   method simultaneously with another thread. Consequently, if one  thread changes the value of a class variable, and another does the same,  the first might expect a certain result after the change, but might expe- rience the effects of another servlet’s alteration instead.  16. A, C, D.  Instance variables are protected because the Single  ThreadModel interface ensures that only one thread will access an  instance’s service …  method at a time. Class variables are not so  fortunate. Because request and session attributes are inherently  thread-safe, implementing the interface has no effect.  17. D.  Synchronizing changes to any attribute or value will ensure that only   one thread can access that variable in that block at a time.  18. C, D.  The getParent   method returns the immediate outer tag   handle, whereas the findAnscestorWithTag …  method can return  any outer tag surrounding the current tag.  19. D.  The bodycontent tag is used to define how the tag should han- dle content existing between the opening and closing tags. The three  options are empty, JSP, or tagdependent.  20. D.  The taglib element serves a different purpose within each   document.  21. B.  The element name is used to identify the name used to access the  tag, whereas rtexprvalue is used to define wither the attribute value  can be dynamically specified. Finally, bodycontent is used to identify  how to handle the content between the tags. isRequired is incorrect.  The correct element is required. It is used to define whether a tag  attribute is required.  22. A.  The value assigned to the name element is used to define the   custom tag suffix within the JSP page.   23. C.  A custom tag that implements any interface must define the   method setPageContext PageContext pageContext  and save a  local instance to have access to all other implicit variables. Support  classes define this method and enable the pageContext handle to be  accessed by subclasses.  24. D.  By default, the doAfterBody   and doStartTag   methods   return the constant SKIP_BODY.   Answers to Assessment Test  liii  25. C, D.  The EVAL_BODY_BUFFERED constant is a valid return type only  if the tag utilizes the body content. This feature is available only when  the tag uses a class or interface that implements the BodyTag interface.  The EVAL_PAGE constant is a valid return only for the doEndTag    method.  26. B.  The first option is not true because only the current request is com- plete, not the originating page. After SKIP_PAGE is returned, the body  is complete, as is the rest of the page.  27. A.  By creating a value object for each record, you need to make only  a single request instead of multiple calls for each element of a record.  28. B.  The Model View Controller design pattern separates controller code  from graphical or view code. Pulling the model out of the Presentation  layer enables the application to grow without affecting existing pieces.  It also provides easier maintainability because each piece is designated  to accomplish a specific task.  29. A.  The WAR file should be placed in the web server’s application   root directory  the directory preceding the context .  30. A, C.  All files located in the  context directory, and any subdirec-  tory other than WEB-INF, are visible to the client.  31. D.  All JAR files should be placed in the  WEB-INF lib directory for   32. B.  The deployment descriptor should be placed directly in the   a particular application.   WEB-INF directory.  33. C.  When defining a servlet, the name is specified by using the tag   servlet-name, whereas the class name uses the tag servlet-class.  34. A.  The servlet-class tag can be used several times within a servlet  tag. What distinguishes one instance from another is the servlet-name.  Most containers will create an instance for each registered name.  35. D.  A servlet can have its own set of initialization parameters by using  the tag init-param. Parameters that apply to the entire application  context are placed within the context-param tags.  36. B, D.  The servlet-mapping outer tag specifies the servlet-name  and url-pattern, defining where the server can locate the specified  servlet.   liv Answers to Assessment Test  37. C.  Auditing is the act of monitoring a system to ensure that all users   are accessing files within their defined security realm.  38. D.  The auth-method tag defines one of four authentication types:   BASIC, FORM, DIGEST, and CLIENT-CERT.  39. A.  The form-login-config tag is used to define any custom or error   pages. It is used only with the FORM authentication method.  40. C.  The security-constraint tag is used to define all web-  resource-collection elements, which include the name, URL,  accessible method, and all auth-constraint roles that can access  those areas.  41. B.  The HttpServletResponse class provides the sendError     method to provide the client with an HTML-formatted error page  created by the server.  42. A.  The exception-type tag requires the fully qualifying exception  name that includes the package name. The third option fails because  the UnavailableException is part of the javax.servlet package,  not the javax.servlet.http package.  43. C.  A PUT request is sent to a servlet’s doPut …  method to enable the   client to place a resource on the server.  44. B.  An HttpSession provides access for the life of the session of a single   client rather than for the life of the application. The ServletConfig  object is incorrect because it is used to get initialization parameters  rather than set attributes. Finally, GenericServlet applies only to  the servlet at hand.  45. A.  The ServletContextListener’s method contextDestroyed   ServletContextEvent e  is called when a context is removed.  46. C.  The distributable tag marks whether an application is likely to  run on multiple systems. The listener tag, however, identifies any  listener-class names that must be registered with the container.  47. D.  Static variables are shared only within the same JVM. In a distrib- uted environment, a new static variable is initialized when a servlet is  accessed in a different system. The same is true with instance vari- ables, except they have an even smaller scope. The ServletContext  applies to the entire application; however, in a distributable environ- ment, a new ServletContext is created when an application is  moved. A session object is the ideal location, because all serializable  data is transferred in a distributed environment.    Answers to Assessment Test  lv  48. C.  A page directive uses the   syntax. It can import more   than one class group by using commas to separate each package type.  49. D.  There is no XML translation for the taglib directive. You must   use the scriptlet syntax.  50. D.  The syntax   identifies a scriptlet. Its code is translated into   the JSP’s service method as code fragments.   51. D.  If a for loop does not have an opening and closing brace, the loop  applies only to the first line after the block declaration. As a result, the  variable i is out of scope, because it is referenced on the second line  after the block declaration.  52. B.  The HttpSessionListener is called when a session is created and   destroyed.  53. B.  The   tag identifies the form used when   protected code is requested in an application that uses form-based  authentication.  54. C.  The auth-constraint element contains a role-name tag used to   define each role with access to the specified file.  55. B.  Modifications to the deployment descriptor enable an application   to control file access for roles. User security must be handled from  within the servlet itself.  56. A.  The security-constraint tag must be used first to list the   resources and roles that require security. The login-config is  defined next to specify the type of container authentication. Finally,  the security-role tag is listed to identify the roles with access.  57. A.  When a scriptlet is translated within the servlet, tags are removed  and text outside the scriptlet code is written to the output stream buffer.  The code snippet translates to the following: if true    out.println “To be” ; else {   out.println “or not to be” ; }  Consequently, the if block is entered and “To be” is printed.  58. E.  The first four options are all valid implicit objects; config, out,   and page are bound to the pageContext object.   lvi Answers to Assessment Test  59. A, B, C.  When accessing a RequestDispatcher through the method  getRequestDispatcher … , all defined attributes are set; if, however,  the dispatcher was accessed by using the getNameDispatcher …   method, these values would not be defined.  60. A, C, D.  Six implicit objects have a page scope. They are config,  response, pageContext, out, page, and exception. After these  variables exit the current page, a new instance is used.  61. B.  The scope attribute is actually used with the jsp:useBean action   to define the bean’s availability.  62. C.  The first option fails because the page directive is used to define  attributes for the entire JSP page, rather than to include a component  in the page. The second option is invalid because the include direc- tive is used for static files. Finally, the last option fails because you  cannot include an applet as a page. An applet requires the interpreter  to run, rather than the container to read a static or dynamic file— instead the jsp:plugin action should be used.  63. C.  A JSP page is translated to a servlet that includes the method _  jspService  . All scriptlet code is placed inside this method.  64. A.  By using a setProperty tag and identifying the property value as  an asterisk, all instance variables that map to the request parameters  will be defined.  65. B.  A Filter is defined using the outer tag filter, and the inner tags  filter-name, which defines the name of the filter, and filter-class,  which defines the actual class name. The last option is incorrect because  since the filter-mapping tag is used to identify which files or objects the  filter will be performed on.

Within this structure,  HTTP methods represent one of many pieces used within an entire web  application to communicate information. In fact, HTTP methods are utilized  by the browser to transfer specific requests to a receiving component. These  methods do not operate in a vacuum. Instead, an HTML trigger sparks the  request, which uses the HTTP protocol to transmit information to a poten- tial component, such as a servlet or JSP. In this chapter, each element leading  up to the servlet or JSP will be examined to ensure you understand how each  HTTP method behaves. Later chapters will cover servlets and JSPs. For now  our focus is to:  Introduce the Java Enterprise  J2EE  model  Present the Hypertext Markup Language  HTML  tags  Present the Hypertext Transmission Protocol  HTTP    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2   Define an HTTP client request, server response, and HTTP request  methods  After discussing the J2EE model, we will zero in on its Presentation tier  or  the Web Client model . Beginning with HTML, each tag will be covered to  identify its functionality and associated trigger. Because the browser uses the  HTTP protocol to transfer client-entered data to its intended destination,  the protocol will be discussed next. The information is transferred in the form  of a request, which contains one of several HTTP request methods. We will  thoroughly discuss each possible method and the characteristics of the  respective response. Our goal is to ensure that you have a thorough under- standing of each method and its associated components.                                                             Introduction to the J2EE Model  3  Introduction to the J2EE Model  “W  run  rite once,   implement   anywhere” was the first phrase Java developers  grew accustomed to hearing. As the language developed and matured, it  began to have an impact on the entire network and took on an additional   anywhere.” This phrase is the foundation  phrase, “Write once,  behind the Java 2 Enterprise Edition  J2EE  architecture. Although com- plex architectures existed before Java, they were limited in flexibility  because their applications were forced to be vendor dependent. Prior to  J2EE, the code for each component was directly linked to a particular  manufacturer. Consequently, changes could not be made in one area with- out hugely affecting another. Java took vendor dependence out of the  equation. The J2EE model enables you to develop components indepen- dent of the operating system or server vendor. These components are reus- able and fully capable of communicating between the specific tier layers.  To ensure success and consistent behavior of the J2EE model, vendors  must provide servers that comply with the associated J2EE Java Applica- tion Programming Interface  API  specification, and developers must  write components that utilize these same interfaces. Compliance results  in components that are both swappable and reusable among different  J2EE servers.  EJB   stands for   Enterprise Java Bean  Figure 1.1 displays the various components that make up the architec- ture. The acronym  . This is a server- side component that manages business objects, their logic, and interaction  with all storage mechanisms, referred to as  Enterprise Information  . The other acronym is JSP, which stands for Java Server Page. Both  Systems JSPs and servlets manage the Presentation layer by interacting with server- side business logic.  , or   EIS  This book focuses on two important object types in this enterprise model:  servlets and Java Server Pages. The first half of the book is based on servlets,  and the second on Java Server Pages  JSPs .  Servlets   are platform-independent   web components  —elements that   bridge the gap between the Presentation tier and the Business Logic, or EIS  Integration tier. In simple terms, they are Java classes that implement specific  interfaces allowing the container to manage their life cycle and communicate                                      4  Chapter 1  cid:2   The Web Client Model  web server   is an application written by a vendor  their data to a browser.

Servlets are saved to a container and  loaded dynamically on an as-needed basis to process business logic and gen- erate a graphical layout for the client. Specifically, servlets are designed to  optimize business logic executed on the server side.  container  F I G U R E 1 . 1  The J2EE model  t s e u q e r   P T T H  H T T P   r e s p o n s e  Client  Client  Web server  Application server  Database  Web server  Application server  Servlet  Servlet  JSP  Servlet  JSP  JSP  Servlet  Servlet  JSP  JSP  EJB  EJB  EJB  EJB  EJB  EJB  EJB  EJB  EJB  Web server  Application server  Presentation tier  Web tier  Business tier  EIS integration tier  Java Server Pages   are also Java objects used to communicate between the  client and server. They, too, execute business logic; however, processing Java  code is not their specialty. Unlike servlets, JSPs are optimized for the layout.  Their elegance lies within their ability to generate easy-to-read graphical  interface code—while servlets provide the opposite. The servlet priority is to  primarily process a request and then create a response. Figure 1.2 defines the  architecture for the Servlet model.

The user begins by making a  , an object containing client intent and  request   data. The request is first sent to the web sever. The server then invokes the  appropriate servlet in step 2. After the servlet receives and processes the request,  it then generates a  an , object containing the information requested      response by the client. This response is sent back to the web server in step 3. As the  intermediary, the web server completes the final step by sending the response  back to the client for an update to the interface.  This book provides a detailed look at each topic to help you understand  the rules and information necessary to pass the Sun Certified Web Compo- nent Developer for J2EE Platform certification exam. In the following  “HTML” section, our focus begins by looking at the technologies necessary  to enable the client to communicate with the web server, or more specifically,  the servlet. The process starts with the client accessing the server via their  web browser, which reads HTML.  T  he   Hypertext Markup Language  HTML    is the intermediary lan- guage between the browser client and all other technologies, such as Java  or networking protocols. Before learning how the information is trans- ferred and how or what the servlet or JSP does with this information, you  need to understand all the rules associated to the first layer—the web  interface.  A large portion of client and server interaction is done by using HTML  forms. A form usually contains one or more HTML tag components. These   HTML                         6  Chapter 1  cid:2   The Web Client Model  components enable a user to select or enter a item for a particular request.  For example, you might encounter an online order form to access market  information. Each field might represent a filter or characteristic used to  locate the stocks you are looking to learn more about. These specifics  within an HTML form notify the server of your needs. Once triggered, a  request is sent with your criteria. Although the purpose of the book is not  to teach you HTML, it is important you understand forms and their asso- ciated tags. This next section covers the various HTML tags and their trig- gers; later we will show you how these forms actually trigger a request to  the server.  When to Use HTML  Your company is developing a website that surveys the public’s purchasing  preferences. In designing the project, a decision must be made on how to  develop the most effective front end. Because the application will be accessed  through browsers, your choices consist of HTML or Java.  Java applets are useful when your site is looking to utilize complex graph- ical user interface  GUI  functionality or render multidimensional images.  They are also used to stream data, such as music or videos, and to display  dynamic data without having to refresh the entire page.  HTML, on the other hand, is best suited for displaying static data, often seen  in news pages or forms. Unlike updating an applet, updating a client HTML  display requires the server to reload the entire page.   When comparing capabilities, Java seems to offer more advantages. For  this site, however, HTML is all that is needed. The site needs to contain  fields of information and choices for the user to select. After the user enters  the necessary data, the site then needs to send all the information to the  server and reload a new or the same page. By using HTML and HTTP, the  site can be developed to be both functional and efficient.  HTML Tags  A variety of HTML tags are used to create custom web pages. Some tags  define components used to display data and or accept input. Other tags are                                                                        HTML  7  used for formatting purposes. In this section, we will present the common  tags used to communicate with servlets and JSPs. Their purpose and associ- ated triggers will be covered as well.  , or   FORM  METHOD  ACTION  controls  TEXTAREA  .

Programmatically they are often referred to as a n   SELECT enable the user to interact with the interface. Some examples are radio but- tons, text fields, buttons, and menus. A user modifies these controls by enter- ing data or selecting available options. In certain cases, a user’s action can  trigger a request to the server. Before you move on to that stage, take a closer  look at the                  First name:             Last name:                         The following is the resulting image.                                                                                                         8  Chapter 1  cid:2   The Web Client Model  A form can contain several control types. Some enable a client to commu- nicate with the server, while others do not. Only components used to acquire  or transfer client information are covered. Labels and images are strictly  visual and will not be addressed. The three main control tags are  ,  INPUT SELECT  . TEXTAREA  , and   If you do not specify a method type for the  appropriate method type for you and generate a   FORM   tag, the browser will assume the   GET   request when triggered.   Tag INPUT  INPUT  tag identifies a control and its attributes, both of which should  The  be included in the form. The most significant attribute is  . It identifies  which control should be used. Following is a list of the possible attributes  used in an input tag:  TYPE  specifies the type of control to create. Your choices are the   TYPE following:  textpasswordhiddensubmitresetbuttoncheckbox radiofileimage  is often the human-language name assigned to the control. It is   NAME also used to identify the element in the servlet.  specifies the initial value of the control. It is not a required   VALUE attribute for any control.  identifies the initial width of the control. In general, the width   controls, size is measured   password  text   or   SIZE is measured in pixels. For  by characters.  MAXLENGTH number of characters the user is allowed to enter.  is used for   text and password to specify the maximum   CHECKED is an attribute used for radio or checkbox controls. It’s a  boolean value that identifies whether the control should be selected.  SRC specifies the location of the image control type.   A closer look at each control will reveal how each attribute affects the   INPUT tag.   HTML 9  INPUT TYPE = 'text' In an HTML form, the type text creates a text field GUI component that  enables the user to enter a single line of text. Here is an example of the code  and resulting image:  <INPUT TYPE=‘text’ NAME=‘firstName’    VALUE=‘Enter your name here’ SIZE=‘20’ MAXLENGTH=‘30’>  The NAME is simply a way to identify the data accessed from this control,  while its VALUE pre-fills the text field. If the VALUE attribute is excluded, the  text field would be empty. The visual width or SIZE of this text field is  20 characters wide, yet the user’s name cannot be greater than 30 characters,  given the MAXLENGTH specification.  INPUT TYPE = ‘password’ In an HTML form, the type password creates a password GUI component  that alters the entered characters to hide their true value. Here is an example  of the code and resulting image:  <INPUT TYPE=‘password’ NAME=‘loginPassword’    VALUE=‘P433w0rd’ SIZE=‘20’ MAXLENGTH=‘20’>  You can define all the same attributes as you can for the text field. The dif- ference between the two is how the characters appear. Although a password  component conceals the true value from the user’s view, the characters are  not encrypted. When a password is sent to the server, the original characters  are transmitted.  INPUT TYPE = ‘hidden’ In an HTML form, the type hidden creates a control that is not rendered,  but whose values can be transmitted back to the server. Here is an example:    In general, the NAME is a string whose VALUE remains the same regardless   of user interaction.    10 Chapter 1  cid:2  The Web Client Model  The user cannot directly modify the VALUE of the control. However, the HTML  designer can set up a trigger  JavaScript  to update the control if some pre- defined action occurs, such as the user selecting a different state.  In our example, this control would be useful on a form that took infor- mation for an order. After the order was placed, the taxRate value would  be sent to the server. Although this value might not remain constant for an  infinite period, it can be changed by the developer or updated dynamically  without performing any compilations.  INPUT TYPE = ‘submit’ In an HTML form, the type submit creates a submit button GUI component  that triggers an HTTP request to submit a form to the server. There are three  ways to create a submit button. Each procedure has a different effect.  Example 1:    The first example creates a default button. Because we do not provide a   VALUE attribute, the label is set to a default string determined by the  browser—for example, “Submit Query” or “Submit.”  Example 2:   By including the VALUE attribute, we can now customize the label on our   submit button, as shown here.  Example 3:   The NAME attribute serves two purposes. It gives us a handle to the com- ponent, and it captures the name value pair btnOrder=Order to include in  the data being sent to the server via a request object.  We’ll talk more    HTML 11  about the details in the upcoming “HTTP” section.  The following is the  resulting image.  While other input controls take in data, the submit button actually trig- gers a request to be sent. As a side note: if you have a form that contains mul- tiple submit buttons, each button will capture all the data from the controls  defined within the same    body tags.   INPUT TYPE = ‘reset’ In an HTML form, the type reset creates a reset button GUI component.  Here is an example of the code and resulting image:     The reset button component is designed to set all control types back to   their original values. It does not provide any form data for a request.  INPUT TYPE = ‘button’ In an HTML form, the type button creates a basic button GUI component.  Here is an example of the code and resulting image:     The button component receives events but does not directly trigger a  request. Instead, it is used to extend the HTML functionality. By using  a client-side scripting language, such as JavaScript, you can cause this com- ponent to trigger other processes to take place.  INPUT TYPE = ‘checkbox’ In an HTML form, the type checkbox creates a check box GUI component.  Here is an example of the code and resulting image:  <INPUT TYPE=‘checkbox’ NAME=‘state’ VALUE=‘CA’  CHECKED> California     12 Chapter 1  cid:2  The Web Client Model    Texas   <INPUT TYPE=‘checkbox’ NAME=‘state’ VALUE=‘AZ’  CHECKED> Arizona    Placing quotes around the attribute definitions is not mandatory, but it is  considered good programming practice.  The check box component enables the user to select or deselect multiple  items. These components are independent from one another, so selecting one  will not affect another. When the information is ready to be sent to the  server, all selected items will be paired by using their assigned name and  value, and then sent with the request. For example, if a request were trig- gered and both California and Arizona were selected, the request data would  include state=CA and state=AZ. Notice that we assign the VALUE attribute,  not the label. If none were selected, then the request would not include data  from these controls.  INPUT TYPE = ‘radio’ In an HTML form, the type radio creates a radio button GUI component.  Here is an example of the code and resulting image:  Example 1: <INPUT TYPE=‘radio’ NAME=‘question’ VALUE=‘Yes’  CHECKED> Loves me     Loves me not     Not sure    The radio button component links multiple buttons, but only one can be  selected at a time. All three buttons in the example are joined because they    HTML 13  share the same NAME attribute of question. This named group represents a  mutually exclusive set of options. If you attempted to make the third option  checked as well, only the last checked control in the group would be selected.  See the following code example and resulting image:  Example 2: <INPUT TYPE=‘radio’ NAME=‘question’ VALUE=‘Yes’  CHECKED> Loves me     Loves me not  <INPUT TYPE=‘radio’ NAME=‘question’ VALUE=‘Confused’  CHECKED> Not sure    As you can see, the first checked item is ignored and only the last one   selected is marked. Again, if a request were created, this last example would  create a name value data pair of question=Confused to send to the server.  SELECT Tag  Now that you’ve gone through all the desired INPUT type tags, you are ready  to understand the SELECT tag. It is designed to create a component that enables  the user to select options. You can set it up to allow either single or multiple  selections. Syntactically, SELECT has an open and close tag. Within its body,  you identify the available choices by using the OPTION attribute. We’ll first  show you the code for a single selection control and its resulting image.  Example 1  single selection :          Vegetarian       Kosher       None     14 Chapter 1  cid:2  The Web Client Model  By default, the SELECT tag allows only single selection. Marking an option  SELECTED causes that choice to appear highlighted when the image is first  rendered or reset. The NAME attribute is used to create the data name value  pair to send with a request. In the preceding example, a triggered request  would include Food Preference=Kosher. Next we will show you how to  create a multiple selection control. Example 2  multiple selection :         Beef       Chicken       Pork       Fish    Adding the MULTIPLE attribute enables you to select more than one option.  In fact, the control takes on a list-like appearance. Again, a request would pro- duce name value pairs for Meat=Chicken and Meat=Fish in this example.   TEXTAREA Tag  A TEXTAREA tag creates a text area GUI component, which enables the user to  enter multiple rows of data. Here is an example of the code and resulting image:    You can pass the exam if you know all the rules! Let us help you get there.     HTML 15  The text area component is created with a ROWS attribute to identify the  number of visible lines. Without this attribute, the number of rows is set to  a default value determined by the browser.  The COLS attribute identifies the visible number of characters per line   without the use of a scrollbar. Because the letter l has a smaller width than  w, the average width is used to measure a character. If the attribute value  is excluded, the browser will apply a reasonable default column width.  The HTML spec encourages browsers to provide automatic word wrap for this  component. Because word wrap is not mandatory, you can programmatically  enforce this behavior by including the following attribute: WRAP=‘VIRTUAL’.  The controls within a form are used to help the developer gather user data   and send client information to the web server. Next, we’ll discuss how  the information is formatted into a query string in preparation for  transportation.  With a better understanding of HTML tags, you can start examining elements  more closely associated with the browser. A query string is a URL-encoded  string that contains data stored in name value pairs.  Say you had an HTML form with the following controls: <INPUT TYPE=‘text’ NAME=‘firstName’ VALUE=‘Name:’         SIZE=‘20’> <INPUT TYPE=‘password’ NAME=‘passwd’ VALUE=‘Password:’         SIZE=‘20’>   Clicking the submit button triggers a request that generates the following   query string:   firstName=Name%3A&passwd=Password%3A&bttn=Send+Now Here are a few important query string rules to remember:   cid:2  Data is transferred in name value pairs.    cid:2  Names and values are URL encoded  hexadecimal ASCII , including   white space, question marks, and all non-alphanumeric values.   Query String   16 Chapter 1  cid:2  The Web Client Model  URL  For example, a percent sign  %  would be denoted with the Unicode  value 0025 and displayed as %25.   cid:2  Name and value pairs are separated by an ampersand  & .   cid:2  Spaces in the name are encoded as a plus sign by the browser, because  URLs cannot contain spaces. The hexadecimal code for a plus sign or  space is %20.   A Uniform Resource Locator  URL  defines the information the client needs  to make a connection to the server. For example:  http:  book.com  or http:  book.com:8080 servlet Registration? name=Ariela&address=1234+Happy+Street The full signature consists of the following:  :   [:port]   [?query-string] The following list is a more detailed breakdown of the various elements   found in a URL and their functions:   Protocol The set of rules used to transmit information. For simple web- site access, you will most often see HTTP used. However, depending on  what information you are trying to access and how, you might see other  types of protocols such as HTTPS, FTP, or NNTP.   Servername Defines the domain name used for the web server. It usually  ends with a .com, .net, .org, .gov, .edu, .biz, .info, .tv, .ws, .to,  .co, .uk, or something similar.   Port Required only if the default port 80 is not being used. It is a  numeric value  from 0–65,535  designated by the web server for that  particular service.   URL path Defines additional directories to locate the resource.  Query string A URL-encoded string that represents data being sent in an  HTTP request.   URI  HTTP  HTTP 17  The Uniform Resource Identifier  URI  is the part of the URL excluding the  domain name and the query string—in other words, all information after  the domain name and before the query string. It specifies the resource.  Given the following address, you can see both the URL and URI: Request address: http:  java.sun.com products servlet index.html?id=‘09’ URL:  http:  java.sun.com products servlet index.html?id=‘09’ URI:  products servlet index.html  The success behind client-server architecture is the ability of both   parties to communicate and transfer data over a network. The means of  transmission depends on what is being sent and how you want that infor- mation delivered. At the lowest level, data is transmitted by using Internet  Protocol  IP . There are two main points you need to know about IP. First,  the packets are a fixed size, and second, you are not guaranteed delivery. If  a packet fails, the protocol will not try to resend the data.   For a more controlled environment, Transmission Control Protocol    TCP  guarantees that the information will be delivered—and in the order it  was sent, without errors. If a failure occurs, this protocol ensures the sender  that it will make several more attempts at delivery. In addition, the size of the  information being transferred can vary.  The next network layer is one built on top of TCP. Hypertext Transfer  Protocol  HTTP  utilizes TCP, but adds a few more custom features. HTTP  is a stateless protocol—meaning its data is not retained from one request to  the next. After a request is made, the connection is closed. Because clients are  not holding open connections to a server, the server can have more clients  connect over a long period of time.   HTTP is also flexible in that it can transmit any file that conforms to the  Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension  MIME . MIME is an extension of  the e-mail protocol used to allow the exchange of different kinds of data files  over the Internet. HTTP was built in conjunction with HTML to enable    18 Chapter 1  cid:2  The Web Client Model  users to access information through a web browser. Selecting a link or trans- mitting data from a form will generate an HTTP request to send to a web  server whose address is defined by a URL.   The process to transmit the request is as follows:  1. An HTTP client or web browser makes a connection to a server.  2. The client initiates a request.  3. The server answers and sends a response to the client.  4. The connection is closed.  Figure 1.3 shows how the client makes a request for a GIF file to the server   and the server responds with the appropriate information.  F I G U R E 1 . 3 HTTP request response communication  Client  Server  GET  image.gif HTTP 1.0 Connection: Keep-Alive User-Agent: Mozilla 4.0  compatible; Windows NT 5.0  Host: localhost: 8080 Accept: image gif, image x-xbitmap, image jpeg, image pjpeg, * *  Request  Response  HTTP 1.0 200 OK Date: Mon, 22 Oct 2001 12:12:01 Server: Apache 1.1.1 Content-Type: image gif Content-Length: 9487 Last-Modified: Thur, 11 Oct 2001 10:25:30 [data of GIF file]  As Figure 1.3 illustrates, each response or request is made up of three   parts: the definition line, the header section, and the body.   The Client Request  The client begins by making a connection with the server. Once linked, the  client enters data and or generates a request for information. If the HTML  form contains data, the name value pairs will be gathered and included with  the request. The request will then be sent to the server, and the client will wait  for a response. Figure 1.4 shows a sample request broken up by category.   HTTP 19  F I G U R E 1 . 4 Categorizing the request  Request line  GET  image.gif HTTP 1.0  Header  general   Connection: Keep-Alive  Header  request   Referer: http:  example.com search.html User-Agent: Mozilla 4.0  compatible; Windows NT 5 Host: localhost: 8080 Accept: image gif, image x-xbitmap, image jpeg,  image pjpeg, * *  Header  entity   Content-Type: application x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 23  Body  name=value&name=value&name=value  Request Line  The client initiates the transaction by connecting to an HTTP server. This  request for information is sent with a line defining the HTTP method or  action desired, the document address, and the protocol version. The format  of a request line is as follows:  Method    Request-URI    Protocol For example: GET        index.html    HTTP 1.0 Aside from the GET method, there are many other method types, which we  will discuss later, in the “Request Methods” subsection. For now, this line  sends the server the information necessary to know what to do and where to  do it, by using a defined protocol.  Header  The client might send additional information after the request line to help the  server process the request. This information can consist of the host name,  type of browser, language, file formats, and more. The header section  usually contains client configuration details and specifics on the types of  document formats that will be accepted in the response. Header information  is sent line by line by using value pairs consisting of the header name and  associated value. This pattern is very much like a java.util.Map.    20 Chapter 1  cid:2  The Web Client Model  The format of a header is as follows:  Keyword:          Value For example: User-Agent:     Mozilla 4.0  compatible;Windows NT 5.0  Accept:         image gif, image jpeg, image jpeg, Accept:         application x-comet, application msword Accept:         application vnd.ms-excel, * * application x-comet, application msword,  application vnd.ms-excel, * * Host:           localhost:8080 Accept-Encoding:gzip, deflate Accept-Language:en-us Referer:        http:  localhost:8080 servlets index.html Connection:     Keep-Alive  Notice that the Accept header can be defined multiple times.  In this example, you can see the first key, User-Agent, identifies infor-  mation about the client browser. The second key defines the type of files the  client will accept, and the third provides more configuration information.  Additional header tags can be utilized. Table 1.1 displays all the possible  header tags for a request.  The header section is optional, but almost always included.  Tag  Accept     Specifies acceptable media types for the response  Accept-Charset  Indicates acceptable character sets for the  response  Accept-Encoding  Restricts the content-coding acceptable for the  response  T A B L E 1 . 1 Common Header Tags    T A B L E 1 . 1 Common Header Tags  continued   HTTP 21  Tag     Accept-Language  Defines all acceptable languages  Age  Allow  Indicates the age of a response body  Specifies methods that the resource defined by the  URI can respond to  Authorization  Requests restricted documents  Cache-Control  Describes how proxies should handle requests and  responses  Code  Specifies the encoding method for the body data  Content-Base  Resolves the relative URLs within the body of the  document being returned  Content-Encoding  Identifies the encoding type applied to the body  prior to transmission  Content-Language  Identifies the language of the response content  Content-Length  Identifies the length of the body measured  in bytes  Content-Location  Identifies the actual location of the entity being  returned  Content-MD5  A computing mechanism used to determine  whether the body was modified during  transmission  Content-Type  Identifies the type of data being returned  Expires  Indicates the date when the response should no  longer be considered valid  From  Specifies the client e-mail address   22 Chapter 1  cid:2  The Web Client Model  T A B L E 1 . 1 Common Header Tags  continued   Tag  Host     Identifies the host and port number the client is  connected to  Last-Modified  Shows the date the returned content was last  changed  Redirects to a new location  Indicates the source from which the current  request was generated.  User-Agent  Identifies the browser’s signature information  Identifies any additional risks associated with the  response  Location  Referrer  Warning  Body  When there is a need to send additional information, a blank line is placed  after the last header line, and then data can follow. The data being sent  to the server from the client is usually included in the body when a POST  action is defined.  An empty line is always included to separate the header and body informa- tion. If a body is not included, an empty line must still be included to signify  the end of the request header.  The Server Response  After a connection is made with the server, the server looks at the first line  to determine whether it can process the request. It then handles the request  internally and generates a response. The response contains information  about the success of the request, header information about the server, and an  actual response, which might be an HTML page, a graphic, or some other  MIME type. Figure 1.5 shows a response broken up by category.   F I G U R E 1 . 5 Categorizing the response  HTTP 23  Status line  HTTP 1.0 200 OK  Header  general   Date: Mon, 22 Oct 2001 12:12:01 GMT  Header  response   Server: Apache 1.1.1  Header  entity   Body  Content-Type: text html Content-Length: 408 Last-Modified: Thur, 11 Oct 2001 10:25:30 GMT    ...   Your order has been processed   ...    Status Line  The server responds with a line that identifies the HTTP version it is using. The  server attempts to utilize an HTTP version that most closely resembles that of  the client. In addition, the server will send a status code to indicate the result  of the request and a phrase to describe the code. The format of a status line is  as follows:  Protocol    Status Code    Description For example: HTTP 1.0     200           OK In this example, a code of 200 means that the request was successful and   that the requested data will be provided after the headers.  Header  The response header is similar to the request header. It contains similar infor- mation as the header of the client request, except it pertains to the server. It  tells the client about the server’s configuration and data about the response.  For example, it might tell the client what methods are supported, request  authorization, or date information. The format is as follows:  Keyword:         Value For example: Date:             Mon, 22 Oct 2001 12:12:01 GMT Server:           Apache 1.1.1   24 Chapter 1  cid:2  The Web Client Model  Content-Type:     text html Content-Length:   408  Last-Modified:    Thurs, 11 Oct 2001 10:25:30 GMT This example responds with the date the response is being sent, the type  of server it was processed on, the format and length of the response, and the  last date the content was modified.  Body  The body consists of the data the client requested. If the Content-Type is  defined as text html, then an HTML document will be sent in return. If the  Content-Type is image jpeg, then an image will be returned.  The server returns one response for each request. If a request comes in for  an HTML page with an image, two responses will be sent in parallel. The  browsers usually join the two to make it appear as if only one response  was sent.  Request Methods  When a web server receives a request, it must first determine how to  handle the information it receives. Looking at the request line answers  this question. An HTTP method is the first element included. There are  seven methods: GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, DELETE, OPTIONS, and TRACE. Each  method serves a different purpose and demands a different type of response.  Table 1.2 summarizes these action methods. Then we’ll go over the meth- ods more thoroughly to ensure that you understand their differences and  functionalities.  T A B L E 1 . 2 Request Method Summary   Action  Description  Retrieves a resource  GET  POST  Transfers client information to the server   T A B L E 1 . 2 Request Method Summary  continued   Action  Description  HTTP 25  PUT  HEAD  Provides a new or replacement document to be stored on  the server  Retrieves only the header information pertaining to the  requested resource  DELETE  Removes a file from a specified URL  OPTIONS  Returns the supported HTTP methods of the server  TRACE  Returns the entire network route that the request took, from  the client to the server and back  GET Method  A GET method is a request designed to retrieve static resources such as an  HTML document or an image from a specific location on the server. When  a client defines a GET action, they are most likely asking the server to return  the body of a document identified in the request URI. When sending the  request, the client might send additional information to the server to help  process the request. The information will be transmitted in a query string  attached to the URL.  The advantages of appending a sequence of characters to the URL are that  the page can be bookmarked or e-mailed. Also, the data does not need to be sent  from a form, thus removing one step from the process of retrieving the data.  There are disadvantages to transferring data via the URL as well. First, the  client cannot send a large URL because most servers limit the URL string to  about 240 characters. Second, because a GET request can be bookmarked, it  is considered idempotent, which means the request can be safely repeated  without necessarily consulting the user. Consequently, GET requests should  not be used to cause a change on the server for which the client would be held  responsible. Imagine a client who is ready to place an order at a website that  uses a shopping cart. If the order request was processed by using a GET, then  the order could be placed multiple times, causing several charges to be made  against the client’s payment method. The result could be an overcharged,  irate customer.   26 Chapter 1  cid:2  The Web Client Model  Other types of GETs are as follows:  conditional GET Returns a response only under specified circumstances.  The request message header contains at least one of the following fields:  If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since, If-Match, If-None- Match, or If-Range.  partial GET Requests that only part of the entity be transferred. If a  client already holds some of the data, and the data has not changed on the  server, there is no need to retrieve the entity in its entirety. A partial GET  must include a Range header field. This header enables the client to  retrieve a section of data, rather than the entire entity. A partial GET can  be used when an interrupt occurs and the client already has part of the  entity in memory. There is no need to request bytes already received.  A common example of a GET request is made through search engine que- ries. The user enters the criteria for the information they want to be returned  and then they select Search. In most cases, this triggers a GET request  whereby the criteria is converted to a query string and added to the URL. In  response, the web server will return static pages of related information. Let’s  examine this example in more detail.  Imagine you are accessing a search engine. The focus is set in a text field,  and you are prompted to enter the details of your search. You type in your  specifics and then click the Search button. A simple version of the HTML  code would look like the following:                   The Famous Search Engine                       Just ask…                         Enter your critera:                                                               HTTP 27  If you entered Motorcycle as your criteria and then pressed the Submit  button, the browser would create a GET request that would look similar to  the following code:  GET  servlet Search HTTP 1.0 User-Agent: Mozilla 4.0  compatible; Windows NT 5.0  Host: educationaledge.net Accept: image gif, image x-xbitmap, image jpeg, * *  criteria=Motorcycle The data from the form would be converted to a URL-encoded format  and appear in the Address or Location field of your browser, along with  the URL.  After the server receives and processes this request, it would send a   response that resembles the following code:  HTTP 1.0 200 OK Date: Sun, 16 Sep 2001 17:01:43 GMT Server: HypoteticalServer 1.0 MIME-version: 1.0 Content-Type: text html Last-Modified: Wed, 17 July 2001 12:10:05 GMT Content-Length: 6790    …     After the response is sent, the browser would then display the new page   for the user to view and access.  Although a search engine is a typical example of one use for a GET request,  keep in mind that several other scenarios could prompt such a request. For  example, you could use the GET to request any one of the following  resources:   cid:2  A file or image   cid:2  Output from another language running on the server   28 Chapter 1  cid:2  The Web Client Model   cid:2  Results from a compilation   cid:2  Information from another hardware device—for example, a database   query or video footage—accessible by the server.  At this point, we have exhausted all the details associated with the GET  method. You are now ready to learn about the intricacies associated with the  POST method.  POST Method  A POST method is a request designed for posting information to the server.  If a client is looking to place an order or update a database with new infor- mation, the POST method is the best approach given the way it handles the  data transfer.  Unlike a GET, the POST request transfers its data in the body of the actual  HTTP request—the URL does not change. In fact, the exchange is invisible  to the user. In addition, there are security provisions incorporated by both  the client side and server side. The client’s browser proves to be more secure  because bookmarking or e-mailing the URL does not result in storing or  communicating the data in the HTTP request—because it simply isn’t  present in the URL. On the server’s end, the approach is more secure because  the server’s access log does not record the dynamic data that would be  present when using a POST method. This also means that client actions are  prevented from being repeated without the consent of the user. When trans- ferring credit card information or updating a database, the POST method is  the perfect solution. It performs the action once, and the information is safer  because it is not displayed in the URL. There is yet one more advantage: the  amount of data that is transferred can be very large, because the size of a  request has no limitation.  There is one disadvantage you face with a POST request: it must be sub- mitted from a form. Because of the way the data is encoded, a POST request  cannot be transmitted from any other resource.   The next example uses a form to POST a request and generate a result.   Let’s say you access a website that requires you to register your login name  and password. The HTML code would look something like this:               Register NOW!        HTTP 29                           Enter your login name:                  Enter your New Password:                   Re-enter your New Password:                               If you entered a login name of Delon, a password of ch1pDe3ign3r    twice , and then hit the Submit button, the browser would generate a POST  request to transfer the information to the server and retrieve the opening  page to this site. The client request might look similar to the following:  POST  servlet Register HTTP 1.0 User-Agent: Mozilla 4.75[en] Windows NT 5.0; U  Host: educationaledge.net Accept: image gif, image x-xbitmap, image jpeg, * *  name=Delon&password=ch1pDe3ign3r&password=ch1pDe3ign3r The data from the form is converted to the URL-encoded standard and  becomes a part of the entity body. Also, there must be a blank line between  the header data and the body to notify the server to handle information from  each part differently. After the server receives and processes this request, it  might send a response containing the next page or a message:  HTTP 1.0 200 OK Date: Sat, 18 Mar 2001 13:21:44 GMT Server: HypoteticalServer 1.0 MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: text html Last-Modified: Mon, 10 Mar 2001 11:16:15 GMT Content-Length: 525   30 Chapter 1  cid:2  The Web Client Model  PUT Method            Press the button below to begin shopping…               The request response process would then begin again after the user   selected the Shop Now button.  In general, a POST request provides a safer environment for requests that  require clients to cause changes to a server resource. The need for security  and the size of data being transferred will help define whether you should use  a GET versus a POST request.  The PUT method is the complement to the GET method. Instead of getting  static information, it requests to store static information. A PUT method asks  the server to store the content body to the URI identified in the request line.  For example, imagine you have an HTML editor that you use to create  web pages. You will likely want to use the editor to publish the document to a  defined server. This can be done by using a PUT request. Let’s say you create  a simple HTML page that contains the phrase “United we stand!” The editor  then has to provide a publishing option asking you for the destination of  your transfer and  most likely  some authentication information. After pro- viding the necessary information, you press a button  for example, an OK  button , which triggers a request. The request might look something like the  following:  PUT  test.html   HTTP 1.0 Connection: Keep-Alive User-Agent: Mozilla 4.75[en] Windows NT 5.0; U  Host: publish.com Accept: image gif, image x-xbitmap, image jpeg, * * Content-Length: 150         United we stand!        HTTP 31  The server will store the entity body in the directory  test.html and   likely respond with the following: HTTP 1.0    201   Created Date: Fri, 26 Oct 2001 16:02:15 GMT Server: HypotheticalServer 1.0 Content-Type: text html Content-Length: 50   The file was created.  If authentication fails, the server will send a response body to identify   that authentication was denied and the user can try again with the correct  information.  HEAD Method  A HEAD method is a request that is almost exactly like a GET. The only dif- ference is that a HEAD request does not return the entity body. It returns the  response line and headers only. Usually this type of request is used to verify  a document’s existence or properties. You could send a GET or a HEAD to see  whether a document exists, and if it does not exist, both requests will return  errors. If it does exist, then the response for a HEAD will be much smaller than  that of a GET and consequently save you network bandwidth. The other rea- son to use HEAD is to learn about the properties of a particular resource.  Remember, the response headers identify the document’s size, type, and  modification time.  Here are some examples of common uses for HEAD requests:   cid:2  By identifying the modification time, you can determine whether there   is a need to update a cached version of the resource.   cid:2  The document size can let you deal with layout issues before retrieving  the actual document. In fact, if it’s very large, it gives you a chance to  determine an alternate plan instead of waiting for it to be returned and  then trying to figure out what to do about the data.   cid:2  The type of document can be essential if you are looking to support or   view only certain kinds.   cid:2  The type of server can notify the client of special query features that   might be available to produce a more precise request.   32 Chapter 1  cid:2  The Web Client Model  Do keep in mind that header information from the server is optional.   Client requests shouldn’t rely on non-default data from a specific header.  DELETE Method  The complement to the PUT method is the DELETE method. Whereas PUT  enables you to place a file at a particular URL, the DELETE method enables  you to remove a file from a particular URL.  A client request might read: DELETE  graphics badNews.gif HTTP 1.1 A server response might look like the following: HTTP 1.0 200 OK Date: Sat, 28 Oct 2001 21:10:05 GMT Server: MyServer 1.0 Content-Type: text html Content-Length: 25    URL was successfully deleted   A server will likely ask for authorization before performing such a task,   but if successful, a code of 200 will be returned.  OPTIONS Method  The OPTIONS method is used to return all supported HTTP methods on the  server. It returns an Allow header and acceptable HTTP methods as values.  For example, if the server supports GET, HEAD, TRACE, and OPTIONS, part of  the response will consist of the following: Allow: GET, HEAD, TRACE, OPTIONS If you are looking to assess the situation before attempting a call, the   OPTIONS method is a good approach.  TRACE Method  When a request is sent, it passes through a series of proxy servers. During  that journey, there is a chance that some of the headers have been changed.  The TRACE method returns the request header values to the client to deter- mine whether any changes took place. It is mainly used to help debug and  perform an action similar to a traceroute. A traceroute is Unix command    Summary  Exam Essentials 33  that identifies all the locations or IP addresses that a request has utilized to  get to its target address.  A solid understanding of all the HTTP request methods will help identify  how a request maps to a servlet. In the next chapter, we will discuss the path  of the request and how and what it does in the servlet.  In this chapter, we covered the details associated with the Servlet model.   Specifically, we discussed:   cid:2  An overview of the J2EE model   cid:2  HTML form tags   cid:2  HTTP requests responses   cid:2  HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, DELETE, OPTIONS, and TRACE  So far, we have been focusing on the communication between the client,  browser, and server. An HTTP request communicates with the browser and  client, while the HTTP response communicates with the server and browser.  We discussed the details associated with HTML, the language understood by  browsers, and the HTTP protocol used to communicate the client’s wants  and data to the web server. These topics thoroughly covered exam Objec- tive 1.2 and set us up to cover Objective 1.1. In the next chapter, we will  discuss the path of the request and how it is handled within a servlet.  Exam Essentials  Be able to identify the functionality of the GET, POST, and HEAD methods. Each method is designed to retrieve information; it is how and what they  retrieve that differentiates one from another. You should know what kind  of information each request retrieves and how the information is  retrieved.   34 Chapter 1  cid:2  The Web Client Model  Be able to identify the benefits associated with choosing to use a GET  request. The GET method places its data in the URL, making it available  for caching or e-mailing. If this data contains sensitive material, using this  method could be a security risk. Because the GET method transfers its data  in its URL, it does make the page easier to access. If used in the right  circumstance, this can be a benefit.  Be able to identify the benefits associated with choosing to use a POST  request. The POST method hides its data in the body of the request. This  makes the page less accessible, which can be a good or bad factor depend- ing on the task at hand. The POST request is also designed to send an error  if the browser attempts to process the request more than once. This can be  a benefit if you are performing a request by using a transaction that  updates some resource on the server.  Be able to identify the benefits associated with choosing to use a HEAD  versus a GET request. At times you might want to retrieve only the  headers of a request to determine whether the resource exists or to deter- mine the properties of the resource. In such cases, there is no need to  retrieve the body of the request. Instead, a HEAD request becomes ideal.  It returns only the header information provided by the server. A GET  could accomplish the same tasks, but it would eat up wasted bandwidth.  Be familiar with browser controls and how they operate in relation to the  GET, POST, and HEAD methods. Browsers use HTML to display compo- nents and capture their data. Each control stores specific data that is  transferred when triggered. The default request of an HTML form is a  GET request. It is often triggered with a submit button  other controls can  trigger requests if customized by using JavaScript . It retrieves informa- tion but does not make modifications on the server side. A POST, on the  other hand, is also triggered by similar controls, but it can make changes  or process critical information on the server. A POST request is identified  by specifying the METHOD=‘POST’ attribute of the FORM tag. Both requests  can return new HTML pages or new data to be rendered. A HEAD request  simply returns the header information without making modifications to  the current HTML page.

A PUT method request is used to replace or store files on the server.   The request URI identifies the location for the server to store the  resource.   2. C.  If a method is not specified in a form, the browser will assign the   GET method to the request by default.  3. A, B, D.  A query string must conform to the URL-encoded standard  defined by RFC 1738. Characters that are not-alphanumeric are rep- resented in a hexadecimal format  %XX . The first option is invalid  because of the included spaces between Sunset and Blvd., and  between “.” and “”. Using those symbols is illegal as well. The second  option fails for similar reasons, and the last option is invalid because  of the space placed before the name Michael.   4. C.  Because the GET method transfers data via the URL, its data can be  bookmarked and saved for later use. This is far from secure. In addi- tion, the data can be cached and processed multiple times without the  client’s approval. Again, these are features that are not secure if you  are communicating sensitive data.  5. D.  The SELECT tag is used to create a control that enables the user to  select an option from a drop-down list. If you include the MULTIPLE  attribute, the control will look like a list, not a drop-down. Single  selection is the default. Finally, the SELECT tag requires a closing tag,  leaving the last option as the only correct response.  6. B.  The ampersand  &  is used to separate name value pairs from one  another. The plus sign  +  is used to fill blank space. The equal sign  =   is used to separate the name and value. This leaves the correct answer  of a question mark  ? . It is used to identify the beginning of the query  string.  7. A.  An HTTP request begins with a request line, which defines the   action that is being desired by the server. It can then contain a header  and body.  8. C.  Visually, the password control alters the characters so they are not   comprehensible. When they are sent, however, they appear in their  normal text format.   42 Chapter 1  cid:2  The Web Client Model  9. A, D.  The GET method should not be used to make any modifications  to the server  such as updating a database  or to send sensitive infor- mation  such as a credit card number . Because the information is  present in the URL, this is extremely unsafe. In addition, the URL can  be bookmarked and the request can be triggered multiple times with- out the knowledge of the client. Consequently, a GET request should  not be used to perform transactions that would have negative effects  if executed multiple times.   10. A.  A submit button generates a request from an HTML form. The   other controls provide name value data pairs to accompany the  request.  11. C.  The Content-Type header tag is used to identify the type of data  being returned. The first option is valid because multiple Accept tags  are acceptable. You might think the third option is questionable  due the hard carriage return within the Accept declaration; how- ever, the header request is valid. A hard carriage return is legal when  listing header data.  12. E.  A GET request is used to get information from the server. All four  options are valid types of data for a client to request via a call to GET.  13. C.  Literal symbols within a query string are denoted by using its   Unicode value. The value is displayed by using the following notation:  %XX. The final answer is invalid because a plus sign is used to represent  a blank space.   14. D.  A URL contains all resources necessary to locate and communi- cate with its target source. The protocol defines the rules used to trans- mit information, while the servername is the domain name used for  the server. Finally, the query string is the data transferred from the  client to the server. A port can also be defined if the default 80 is not  being used.  15. B.  The element SRC is an input attribute used to specify the location  of the image control type. The SIZE element is also an input attribute.  Its purpose is to identify the initial width of the control. The last option,  FORM, is a tag used encompass a variety of controls. The correct input  type is hidden. These are controls that are not rendered, but whose  values can be transmitted back to the server.

So, in the following sections of this chapter, we will  map the HTTP method directly to its servlet counterpart method and  address the details associated with each method. The methods themselves  rely heavily on the request and response objects passed in as arguments; con- sequently, we will show you how to extract information from the request  and how to construct a suitable response.   After covering the request object in great detail, we will address the servlet   do   and   init    destroy    service …    method.

Depending on the HTTP request sent to the client, a spe- cific servlet method will be assigned to handle the response. In this section,  we will discuss the list of possible servlet methods that the container will  invoke to handle an incoming request.  Until now, we have addressed how HTML tags use the HTTP protocol   is an object containing the   methods to send requests. Remember, a   request  The Servlet Methods                                                                                                                      The Servlet Methods  45  client’s intent, header information, and possible parameters. We haven’t  discussed how the HTTP protocol methods communicate with the servlet.  Now, we will identify the specific mappings between HTTP methods and  those in the   HttpServlet   class.  After a request is sent to a web server, the request line is parsed to deter- mine the desired action. The HTTP method is then mapped to the associated  servlet method. Because all HTTP servlets must extend the    HttpServlet class, the servlets are guaranteed to have the appropriate method for the  HTTP action. The Java Servlet Specification 2.3 states the following:   cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2   GET   requests are handled with a   doGet …    servlet method.  POST   requests are handled with a   doPost …    servlet method.  PUT   requests are handled with a   doPut …    servlet method.  HEAD   requests are handled with a   doHead …    servlet method.  First we’ll present the commonalities among all the   do  XXX   methods, and   then we’ll detail each one separately.   doXXX  …   HttpServlet   request methods    All corresponding    share the same  signatures, parameters, and error handling. All methods behave similarly.  They each take a request, process information, and return a response. As a  result, the structure for these methods is similar; they take in the same  parameters and throw the same exceptions.  XXX  do  Method Signature  protected  HttpServlet   request methods  As we have just stated, the structure for the  is standard. Each method is  , meaning only classes within the  same package or subclasses can access these methods. In addition, when they  are overridden in your servlet, you can make them either protected or public.  The return value is void because the response is sent by the container. A  request and response object are provided via the parameters, and both the  ServletException transmission or streaming errors:   are thrown in the event of   IOException   and   protected void doXXX HttpServletRequest req,                      HttpServletResponse res      throws ServletException, IOException                                              46  Chapter 2  cid:2   The Servlet Model  Parameters  By using the parameters passed in, you can access and create the necessary  information to complete the requested task.  provides you a handle to the original request. By using this object, you get  HTML parameters, header data, the method type, and date information.     provides you a handle to construct a response.  HttpServletResponse resp  is an object that often contains header information  Remember, a  response and a possible body for the client to display.      req HttpServletRequest  Error Handler  Whenever information is transferred from point A to point B, a myriad  of potential problems can occur. Sometimes those problems are a result of  the network, which arise due to failures in the source or target system at  runtime. Other times the problem is in the request or response object itself.  The following list identifies the potential problems that can take place:   cid:2  If a content header cannot be handled, the container should issue  an error message  HTTP 501 - Not Implemented  and discard the  request. 5xx error codes are usually reserved for server errors, and 3xx  and 4xx error codes are reserved for application or container errors.   cid:2  If the request sent is incorrectly formatted, the doXXX …  method  will ignore any logic included in the method and simply return an  HTTP 400 - Bad Request error message.    cid:2  If an input or output error is detected when the servlet handles the   HTTP request, a java.io.IOException is thrown.   cid:2  If the HTTP request cannot be processed, a ServletException is   thrown.  doGet  …   The server indirectly calls the doGet …  method when a GET request is sent.  By overriding the HttpServlet’s doGet …  method in your servlet, you  get a handle to the request to retrieve information about the call and then  generate a response to return. The code for this signature is as follows:  protected void doGet HttpServletRequest req,                      HttpServletResponse res      throws ServletException, IOException   The Servlet Methods 47  Like the GET action, the doGet …  method is used to retrieve data. It is  different in that instead of requesting the data, it actually performs the func- tionality necessary to get the data. It also is capable of sending a response  back to the receiver.   The GET method should be based on the following components:  Safe This implies that the user cannot be held accountable for any side  effects. For example, querying data has no side effects, whereas changing  data does.  Idempotent This means that the request can be safely repeated. Again,  making a query is both safe and idempotent; buying a product online is  not safe or idempotent.   A doGet …  method is generally coded by using the following steps:   1. Reads the request data  2. Writes the response headers  3. Gets the response’s writer or output stream object  4. Writes the response data  Before writing the response data, it is considered good practice to set the  content type of the response to identify its format. For example, you could  set it to text html if the response output is written by using HTML tags, or  text plain if it’s just simple text strings. This is especially important when  using a PrintWriter object to return a response. In fact, setting the content  type should be done before accessing the PrintWriter object. The container  will write the headers before the body of the response is committed. Conse- quently, if you plan to modify the header information, it should be done  prior to flushing a response body.   Another practice that is encouraged is to set the Content-Length header  by using the request object to notify the container of the document size. This  information enables the servlet container to use a persistent connection to  return the response, which improves performance. By default, a container  will set a response buffer size. If the content length fits inside that response  buffer, then the container automatically sets its content length.   These issues aside, the doGet …  is the best place to include logic for   retrieving safe and idempotent requests. For tasks that don’t require these  precautions, but also request data, the doPost …  is more suitable.    48 Chapter 2  cid:2  The Servlet Model  doPost  …   The server indirectly calls the doPost …  method when a POST request is  sent. By overriding the HttpServlet’s doPost …  method in your servlet,  you get a handle to the request to retrieve, update, or alter information and  then generate a response to return to the client. The benefit of the POST  action is that it enables the client to send one request with an unlimited  amount of data to the web server. Data is more protected when using a POST   as opposed to a GET request , because it isn’t blatantly visible or automati- cally cached. Processing credit card information is the prime example of  when to use a POST request, which calls the doPost … .  The code for this signature is written as follows: protected void doPost HttpServletRequest req,                       HttpServletResponse res       throws ServletException, IOException As for style, the doPost …  is coded in a similar fashion to the doGet … .  It gets the request information, processes the data, and generates a response.  In addition, the rules associated to constructing the response are the same.  The doPost …  method is different from the doGet …  in that it does not   need to be safe or idempotent. In fact, most POST requests do have side  effects, and the user should be held accountable. Let’s say your user is pur- chasing stocks. That order should be processed in a doPost …  method. This  type of request is designed to prevent the user from repeating the same action  because doing so could have such serious side effects.   In summary, the doGet …  is the best place to include logic for retrieving  safe and idempotent requests. For tasks that don’t require these precautions,  but also request data, the doPost …  is more suitable.   The server indirectly calls the doPut …  method when a PUT request is sent.  Usually a PUT request is made when the client is looking to place a file on the  server. The process is written in the body of the doPut …  method.   The following is how the code for doPut …  should be written: protected void doPut HttpServletRequest req,                      HttpServletResponse res      throws ServletException, IOException Like the doPost … , the doPut …  does not need to be safe or idempo- tent. The actions taking place in this method can have side effects that hold   doPut  …    doHead  …   doDelete  …   The Servlet Methods 49  the user accountable. Consequently, it is considered good practice to pro- tect the URL from errors by saving a copy of the affected URL in a temporary  directory or location.   Like an FTP request, the doPut …  is effective in processing requests used   to transfer data to a specific location.   The server indirectly calls the doHead …  method when a HEAD request is  sent. A HEAD request is used when the client is interested in only the response  header information. Prior to the Java Servlet Specification 2.3, an HTTP  HEAD request called the doGet …  method. It was designed to process the  entire method but return only the header information from the response. The  current release includes a doHead …  method in the HttpServlet class for  the developer to override. Now, the doHead …  method is called without the  need to process a body request.   The following shows how to define a doHead …  method: protected void doHead HttpServletRequest req,                       HttpServletResponse res      throws ServletException, IOException Like the doGet … , the doHead …  should be written to be safe and idem-  potent. That is pretty easy to do because the doHead …  usually contains  only header information. The servlet specification includes this method to  improve performance. Now, when the respective HEAD method is called, the  headers can be set and the response returned. There is no need to process  information for a body that will not be returned.   The next few methods are not directly mentioned in the objectives, but  they can be potential options for some of the questions. A general under- standing of these topics will help you find the correct answer during the exam.  The server indirectly calls the doDelete …  method when a DELETE request  is sent. A DELETE request is used to remove a document or web page from  the server.   The method signature for doDelete …  is as follows: protected void doDelete HttpServletRequest req,                         HttpServletResponse  res       throws ServletException, IOException   50 Chapter 2  cid:2  The Servlet Model  doOptions  …   Like the doPost … , this method does not need to be either safe or   idempotent. Because the action of deleting can have serious effects, it’s a  procedure that you want the client to be held accountable for taking. For  example, let’s say that another company recently bought your company.  As a result, you need to change the company’s logo to represent a new  image. You could make a request to DELETE the old graphic file and then  make a request to PUT a new image in its place. As a precaution, it is con- sidered good practice to save a copy of the old image in a backup directory  or location.   The server indirectly calls the doOptions …  method when an OPTIONS  request is sent. An OPTIONS request is used to determine which HTTP  methods the server or servlet supports. The request returns only header  information. Most importantly, it returns a header tag called Allow and  HTTP method values, which represent the doXXX methods available on the  specified servlet.   The method signature for the doOptions …  method is as follows: protected void doOptions HttpServletRequest req,                          HttpServletResponse      res  throws ServletException, IOException Let’s say your servlet overrides the doGet …  and doPost …  methods.   An OPTIONS request will return the following header:  HTTP 1.0 200 OK Allow: GET, HEAD, POST, TRACE, OPTIONS Servlet-Engine: Tomcat Web Server 3.2.3      JSP 1.1; Servlet 2.2; Java 1.3; Windows 2000 5.0 x86;    java.vendor=Sun Microsystems Inc.  Now, you might be asking yourself why all those methods are available if  you’ve overridden only the doGet …  and doPost …  methods. The reason  is that if you override the doGet method, by default, you also inherit the  HEAD and TRACE methods. You don’t have to override the doHead …  and  doTrace …  methods, and the default execution will be performed. The  OPTIONS method is available for every servlet, so this cannot be excluded. There is generally no need to override this method unless the servlet imple-  ments methods beyond those implemented by HTTP 1.1. The default  implementation is almost always sufficient.   doTrace  …   The Request 51  The server indirectly calls the doTrace …  method when a TRACE request is  sent. A TRACE request is used to return the headers sent with the request to  the client. It is usually used to help debug the servlet.  The method signature for the doTrace …  method is as follows: protected void doTrace HttpServletRequest req,                        Httpservletresponse      res  throws ServletException, IOException To understand how a trace works, let’s walk through an example. Say you   send out a request that contains the following information:  Request Line: TRACE  greetings servlet Registration HTTP 1.0 The return response might look similar to this code sample: HTTP 1.0 200 OK Content-Type: message http Content-Length: 48 Servlet-Engine: Tomcat Web Server 3.2.3  JSP 1.1;    Servlet 2.2; Java 1.3.0; Windows 2000 5.0 x86;    java.vendor=Sun Microsystems Inc.   TRACE  greetings servlet Registration HTTP 1.0 The doTrace …  method provides a trace for the request sent from the  client to the servlet. If the request passes through a proxy, the request might  get modified. The doTrace …  method can return either the original,  unmodified request or a modified request, if changes were made. As a final  note, there is usually no need to override the doTrace …  method because  the functionality is already built into the default implementation.  Now that you have looked at each method, it is important to understand   the details associated with the parameters that these methods utilize.  The Request  The request object provides the server with the client data necessary to   process the request. This can include information about the header, client’s  host machine, form data entered by the client, and servlet. As the request    52 Chapter 2  cid:2  The Servlet Model  F I G U R E 2 . 1 The request response path  object travels from client to server, it is wrapped by the ServletRequest  interface to provide basic client information. It is then wrapped again with  the HttpServletRequest interface to provide request information such as  header data, cookies  which we will discuss later in this section , and other  servlet-related items. Figure 2.1 demonstrates the path a request object takes  and how it returns as a response.  HTTP request  HTTP  response  HTTP request  Servlet engine  HTTP  response  Web server  HttpServletRequest  HttpServletResponse  HttpServlet service …  Application logic  and content generated  After the request object reaches the service …  method, it will be passed   to the appropriate HTTP request method. At that point, you can extract  client information by using the request object handle passed to the appropri- ate HTTP request method. When taking the exam, you should be familiar  with the method signatures, their purposes, and their associated interfaces.  As a developer, knowing these methods will help you create robust servlets  that contain the necessary details to accomplish your task. In this section,  we will discuss the interfaces and methods available to extract and modify  the request object.  After the request is sent to the server, it is converted to a ServletRequest  object, which contains the user entered data, or parameters of the request.  The container also creates a corresponding ServletResponse object  to provide the receiver an object to transfer data back to the original  source. These two objects are passed to the Servlet interface method  service ServletRequest req, ServletResponse res . A servlet can  receive these objects because all servlets must implement an interface that  extends the Servlet interface. Before these objects reach the actual servlet,  they are cast to HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse objects,  which include header and date information. Now these objects are ready to  be passed to the service …  method of the actual servlet object. Figure 2.2  displays the path.

Listing 2.1: Using the getParameter …  Method  import javax.servlet.*; import javax.servlet.http.*; import java.io.*; import java.util.*;  public class GetData extends HttpServlet {    protected void doGet HttpServletRequest req,                        HttpServletResponse res      throws ServletException, IOException {       String enteredName = req.getParameter "firstName" ;       Enumeration ctrlNames = req.getParameterNames  ;       String[] states = req.getParameterValues "location" ;        res.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = res.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " Name entered: " + enteredName + " " ;       out.println " Control Names are:  " ;        while ctrlNames.hasMoreElements    {         out.println  String ctrlNames.nextElement   + " " ;       }          The Request 55        out.println "  The values selected are: " ;       for  int i=0; i<states.length;i++  {         out.println states[i] + " " ;       }       out.println "  " ;       out.println " " ;       out.close  ;   }  }  Within the service …  method, you use the request object to retrieve the  parameter names and values entered into the HTML form. When you run  this servlet, you begin by accessing the following graphic.  After you enter values into the form and select the GO! button, a request   is generated. This request is sent to the servlet and passes through the  service …  method. You first get the value  Arti Krause  entered into  the control called firstName. You then get the names of all the controls  in the request: location, button, firstName. Finally, you get the selected  parameter  California  for the control named location. Because the  HttpServletRequest has header information, it is aware that the action  defined by the form was a GET request. Consequently, the doGet …   method is called next, after the service …  method, and the following  output is generated.   56 Chapter 2  cid:2  The Servlet Model  Within the doGet …  method, the information is formatted and placed  inside HTML tags, and into an OutputStream or PrintWriter extracted  from the response. This response is then sent back to the browser to render  the information.   The ServletResponse object provides methods that help you construct   a response. These methods are as follows: void setContentType String type  Before sending response information, you must notify the receiving applica- tion of the content type so it knows how to handle the response data. Because  you are transmitting HTML text and the type is formatted as a MIME exten- sion type, you set the content to text html rather than just html.   The second step in developing a response is to extract a suitable stream to   transfer the information:   OutputStream getOutputStream   This method provides a binary stream that enables you to transfer the   data by using bytes.   Another approach is to transfer the data in character or Unicode format.   A PrintWriter stream is used to write text:   PrintWriter getWriter   While the servlet can extract the values from an HTML page by using the   ServletRequest object, this object also enables the developer to set  attributes for the request.  Attributes  An attribute is a name value pair associated to a request. Either the container  or developer of a servlet can set attributes. This action becomes useful when  a servlet needs to communicate with another servlet. These attributes are  available through the following methods:   cid:2  Object getAttribute String name    cid:2  Enumeration getAttributeNames     cid:2  void setAttribute String key, Object value   Setting the attribute is similar to adding a value to a java.util.Map   object. You define the key, a String, and then the associated object. In a  later part of this chapter, we will cover request dispatching, where a servlet  passes on part of the response development to another servlet. Before a    T A B L E 2 . 1 Predefined Request Attributes   The Request 57  request is dispatched to another servlet, the current servlet might want to  pass along the request, a graphic image, a file, or just a value. This can be  done by using the setAttribute …  method. The receiving servlet can then  access these values by calling getAttribute …  and passing in the key  name. If the key names are not known, the target servlet can get all names by  using getAttributeName … , and then extract the values by using the keys  returned to request the specific value.  In an attempt to ensure a standard among vendors, the specification   requires each container to predefine six attribute values when a request is  generated. By using the key names defined in Table 2.1, you can access the  request value assigned to each attribute.  Request Attribute  Type  javax.servlet.error.status_code  java.lang.Integer  javax.servlet.error.exception_type  java.lang.Class  javax.servlet.error.message  java.lang.String  javax.servlet.error.exception  java.lang.Throwable  javax.servlet.error.request.uri  java.lang.String  javax.servlet.error.servlet_name  java.lang.String  If you intend to forward the request to another servlet, you might want   to change the value associated with a particular attribute. By using the  setAttribute … , you can accomplish this task by passing in the request  attribute name and the new value.  In addition to attributes, the ServletRequest class is also used to acquire   the originating locale of a servlet.  Internationalization  A locale identifies the country and language codes used by a system or server.  When developing a servlet, you should consider the likelihood of some- one else accessing your website from another country. If your site handles    58 Chapter 2  cid:2  The Servlet Model  internationalization, the servlet could request the locale and generate a  response based on the location of the originating client. The following two  methods become useful for such a scenario:    cid:2  Locale getLocale     cid:2  Enumeration getLocales    The getLocale   method returns the preferred locale, also known as the   Accept-Language header, that the client will accept. If the client fails to  provide a header defining its locale, the method returns the default locale for  the server.   Some systems might provide a list of acceptable locale headers. The   getLocales   method returns all Accept-Language headers defined by  the client in decreasing order. It starts with the most preferred locale and  then lists the second preferred locale. As with the getLocale   method, if the  client fails to provide a header, the server’s default locale is returned instead.  Another option is to set the locale through the ServletResponse object.   Syntactically, the method is as follows:  void setLocale java.util.Locale loc  The method changes the header value based on the java.util.Locale   object passed as a parameter.   Besides customizing a response to meet the language needs of the client,  your application may need to receive client information written in a different  format. A ServletRequest object enables data encoding to help with this  type of situation.  Data Encoding   When streaming information, you cannot be guaranteed that the data is  coming from an International Organization for Standardization  ISO  Latin  alphabet. The character encoding value associated to a stream identifies how  the characters are converted between raw 8-bit bytes and 16-bit Unicode  characters. To read a request coming from a website that uses a different  encoding mechanism requires that you change the character encoding value  to a standard understood by the receiving system. Accessing and modifying  these values can be done with the following methods:   cid:2  void setCharacterEncoding String env    cid:2  String getCharacterEncoding     The Request 59  The setCharacterEncoding …  method overrides the assigned   encoding value to enable the servlet to read parameters or input from  the request. The method does throw a runtime exception called java.io .UnsupportedEncodingException if the encoding mechanism is not valid.  Keep in mind that this method must be called before any inquires on the  request are made.   The getCharacterEncoding   method is somewhat self-explanatory. It   returns the name of the encoding value used by the request. If the request  does not specify a name, the method returns null.  At this point, we have covered the important methods of the   ServletRequest object. We are now ready to analyze the methods  in its subclass, HttpServletRequest. When the container casts the  ServletRequest and ServletResponse objects to HttpServletRequest  and HttpServletResponse objects, respectively, additional functionality and  information becomes available to the servlet. Next, we’ll take a closer look  at these methods.  HttpServletRequest and HTTPServletResponse Interfaces The HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse objects provide  methods that enable the developer to access and modify header and  date information. Because these interfaces extend their respective  ServletRequest or ServletResponse interface, they also have access to  the parameter methods discussed in the previous “Parameters” subsection. The HttpServletRequest object gives you access to the request header,   date, and method data. These methods are shown in Table 2.2.  T A B L E 2 . 2 Request Methods   Method  Description   String  getHeader String name   Enumeration  getHeaders String  name   Returns the value of the specified header.  Returns all values of the specified header.   60 Chapter 2  cid:2  The Servlet Model  T A B L E 2 . 2 Request Methods  continued   Method  Description   Returns all heads names.  Enumeration  getHeaderNames    int  getIntHeader String  name   Returns the value of the specified header as  an int. If the header does not exist, a −1 is  returned. If the value cannot be converted to  an int, a NumberFormatException is thrown.  long  getDateHeader String  name   Returns the value of the specified request  header as a long value that represents a Date  object. This method is used with headers that  contain dates, such as Last-Modified.  String getMethod    Returns the HTTP request action name, such  as GET or POST.  To really understand the results of these methods, let’s look at an example.  First we’ll show you the request headers sent from the client to the server, then  the results from the servlet. Here is an example of a header request:  GET  Register index.html HTTP 1.0 Date: Fri, 26 Oct 2001 17:12:10 GMT User-Agent: Mozilla 4.75[en] Windows NT 5.0; U  Accept: image gif, image x-xbitmap, image jpeg, * * Host: educationaledge.net Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Accept-Language: en-us Connection: keep-alive We’ve also included some sample code from a servlet to help you visualize   how and what information is retrieved: public class HeaderServlet extends HttpServlet {    protected void service HttpServletRequest req,                          HttpServletResponse resp      throws ServletException, IOException    {   The Request 61        String acceptValue = req.getHeader "Accept" ;       Enumeration allValues = req.getHeaders "Accept" ;       Enumeration headerNames = req.getHeaderNames  ;       int numbericValue = req.getIntHeader "Max-Forwards" ;       long dateValue = req.getDateHeader "Date" ;         String method = req.getMethod  ;         super.service req, resp ;   }        We’ve excluded the code to process the data so        you can focus on the methods and their result.  }  The output generated by each method is described here:   cid:2  getHeader “Accept”  returns image gif, image x-xbitmap,   image jpeg, image pjpeg, application x-comet,  application msword, application vnd.ms-excel, * *   cid:2  getHeaders “Accept”  returns image gif, image x-xbitmap,   image jpeg, image pjpeg, application x-comet,  application msword, application vnd.ms-excel, * *   cid:2  getHeaderNames   returns all headers:    cid:2  Date   cid:2  User-Agent   cid:2  Accept   cid:2  Host   cid:2  Accept-Encoding   cid:2  Accept-Language   cid:2  Connection   cid:2  getIntHeader “Max-Forwards”  returns -1   cid:2  getDateHeader “Date”  returns date in milliseconds since   1 1 70   cid:2  getMethod   returns GET   62 Chapter 2  cid:2  The Servlet Model  When more than one element is returned, it is stored in an enumeration.  The HttpServletResponse object provides methods that enable the devel-  oper to modify header information. These methods are listed in Table 2.3.   T A B L E 2 . 3 Response Methods   Method  Description   void setHeader String  name, String value   Sets the value for a specific header name.  void setIntHeader String  name, int value   Sets the integer value for a specific  response header.  void  setDateHeader String  name, long date   Sets the date for a specific header. If one  already exists, the new value will replace  the old.  void setStatus int sc   void sendError int sc    void sendError int sc,  String msg   void sendRedirect String  location  throws  IOException,  IllegalStateException  Sets the return status code when there  is no error. Some examples are SC_OK or  SC_MOVED_TEMPORARILY.  Sends an error response to the client by us- ing a specified status code. After a call to this  method, the response is considered commit- ted and should no longer be written to.  Sends an error response to the client by  using the provided status code and a  default HTML-formatted server error page  containing the provided message.  Sends a temporary redirect response to the  client by using the specified redirect location  URL. The location parameter can be a relative  URL; before sending the response to the  client, the container will convert the relative  URL to an absolute URL. Exceptions: it throws  IllegalStateException if the response was  committed, and it throws IOException if an  input or output exception occurs.   The Request 63  The following code snippet shows how these methods would be used:  protected void doGet HttpServletRequest req,                    HttpServletResponse res    throws ServletException, IOException {     response.setContentType "text html" ;      res.setHeader "Server", "The SuperDooper Server 1.0"      res.setIntHeader "Content-length", 1029      res.setDateHeader "Last-modified", 1003947922649 ;          res.sendRedirect "http:  otherserver.com:8090 index.html" ;     … }  The response header, which would be sent to the URL defined by the   sendRedirect method, would look similar to the following:  HTTP 1.0 200 OK Date: Sat Oct 17 12:14:15 PDT 2001 Server: The SuperDooper Server 1.0 MIME-version: 1.0 Content-Type: text html Last-Modified: Wed Oct 24 11:27:15 PDT 2001 Content-Length: 1029 The status code from the setStatus …  method is defined in the response  line—200 and OK. This code was set by the servlet handling the redirect. As  you can see, the name of the server can be customized as well as the last date  of modification. The Last-Modified header is now set to the converted  Date value, which is a long representing the number of milliseconds from  January 1, 1970. Finally the Content-Length contains the numeric value we  set by using the setIntHeader method. Basically, the HttpServletResponse  interface provides the developer with methods to tailor and alter the data in  the response headers.  In addition to header information, the HttpServletRequest class also   provides methods to access path elements.  Path Elements  When a client attempts to locate a servlet, it searches through a specific path  to reach its destination. The path itself, or the request URI, is generally  composed of three important sections:  Request URI = contextPath + servletPath + pathInfo   64 Chapter 2  cid:2  The Servlet Model  Context Path The context path is the first section of the path. It defines the context for  which the servlet resides. Within a single Java Virtual Machine, several web  applications might be running. For each web application, there is one context.  All servlet classes within that web application will share that one context.  Here is the method signature: public String getContextPath    The rules for the context path are as follows:   cid:2  The path begins with a forward slash     but does not end with a for-  ward slash    .  server’s URL namespace.   cid:2  The path is an empty string, “”, if the context is at the base of the web   Servlet Path The servlet path identifies the mapped directory name associated to the  actual servlet. Usually this consists of either the mapped servlet name or a  mapped path to the servlet, but nothing more.  Here is the method signature: public String getServletPath    The rules for the servlet path are as follows:   cid:2  The path is an empty string if url-pattern matches a  * pattern.   cid:2  The path begins with a forward slash     in all other cases.  Path Info The path info consists of extra path information between the servlet path  and the query string.  Here is the method signature: public String getPathInfo    The rule for the path info is as follows:    cid:2  If path information does not exist, the method returns a null.  Now that you’ve reviewed these path elements in detail, you can refer to  the following table for a bit more detail. Table 2.4 displays examples of these  three path types, assuming the context is defined as:  games.   T A B L E 2 . 4 The Request Path Elements  The Request 65  Request Path  Path Elements   games tictactoe  welcome.html  Context path:  games Servlet path:  tictactoe Path info:  welcome.html   games registration  StartServlet  Context path:  games Servlet path:  registration StartServlet Path info: null   games Search  1234?query=Yamaha+R6  Context path:  games Servlet path:  Search Path info:  1234  Path Translations  If the developer is interested in accessing file system path information,  they can do so through the ServletContext by using the following  method:  String getRealPath String path  The getRealPath …  takes in a virtual path value and returns its abso- lute file path on the server. If for example, you passed in index.html, the  return string would represent the entire URL, such as c:\Java\jakarta- tomcat-4.0\webapps\test\index.html. The format of the URL is depen- dent on the platform. If a Unix server ran the request, it would format the  root and slashes differently.   The virtual path is basically the URI without the path info or query string.  The other method used to translate virtual paths is available in the   HttpServletRequest class:  String getPathTranslated   This method takes the path info of the request and computes its real path.  If there is no additional information between the servlet path and the query  string, the method returns a null.   66 Chapter 2  cid:2  The Servlet Model  Finally, it is important to know that the container cannot translate or get  the real path to a resource that is not directly accessible. For example, the  resource might be located in a database or remote system that is not acces- sible locally, or an archive file  such as a WAR file . If the container cannot  translate the virtual path, the method returns a null.  Cookies  The final topic of the request object that we will discuss is the cookie. When  accessing web pages, the browser is often sent numerous cookies to accept  and store data. A cookie is a small data object sent to the browser by the  servlet. It is made up of a name, a single value, and optional descriptive  attributes, such as a version number and path information. When the user  opts to accept the cookie, the browser typically saves the object and then  sends the name and value of each cookie during each request. This technique  is used to help manage servlet sessions. We’ll discuss that in more depth in  Chapter 6, “Session Management.” Suffice to say, by using the getCookies    method of the HttpServletRequest interface, the developer can then  extract the desired cookie attributes.   Cookie[] getCookies   This method returns an array of all the Cookie objects contained within   the request.  If the developer were then interested in sending a cookie to the browser,   they could do so by calling the addCookie …  method of the  HttpServletResponse interface.   The Session  Instead of relying on the client to accept cookies and the browser to   cache the information locally, the Servlet model provides a session object as  an alternative solution to maintaining client information past the life of a sin- gle request. An HttpSession object is created when a client makes its first  request to an application. It provides a way to identify and store informa- tion about the user for an extended period of time. While a request and its  attributes will cease to exist after its response is sent, a session, once created,  will continue to exist until it either is manually terminated or times out.    The Session 67  There are several methods that provide information or control over the life  span of an HttpSession object. They include:   cid:2  public long getLastAccessedTime     cid:2  public int getMaxInactiveInterval     cid:2  public void setMaxInactiveInterval int seconds    cid:2  public boolean isNew     cid:2  public void invalidate    The getLastAccessedTime   method returns the number of milliseconds   since the birth of Unix, January 1, 1970, to the time the client made their  last request. To get the number of seconds the container will allow between  requests to keep the session active, invoke the getMaxInactiveInterval    method. If you would like to define this value in seconds, simply call the  setMaxInactiveInterval …  method. The isNew   method is used to  notify the servlet of the client’s session configuration. It returns a true value if  the client does not know about the session or has not joined it yet. Joining a ses- sion means the client returns session tracking information sent by the server.  If the client, however, refuses to join a session, then a new session is created for  each request. This usually occurs when the web container uses only cookies  for session tracking and the client refuses to accept cookies. The final method  to consider regarding the life of the session is invalidate  . As the name sug- gests, it is used to manually terminate a session. It first unbinds all associated  attribute objects and then prepares the session for garbage collection.  The attribute objects associated to a session usually consist of client infor- mation necessary to complete the entire transaction. Imagine a client who  enters their name and address in one screen; then another screen needs that  same information. Instead of repeatedly asking the client for the same infor- mation for each request made, the client’s name and address can be stored to  the session object and accessed by the servlet without the client. The methods  associated to a session’s attributes are as follows:   cid:2  public void setAttribute String name, Object value    cid:2  public Object getAttribute String name    cid:2  public Enumeration getAttributeNames     cid:2  public void removeAttribute String name    68 Chapter 2  cid:2  The Servlet Model  The method setAttribute …  binds the defined object to the session.  By using the associated key name, you can retrieve the object with the  getAttribute …  method. If however, you are looking to acquire  all object names bound to the session, you will need to invoke the  getAttributeNames   method. The enumeration returned can be used  to access all objects via the getAttribute …  method. In addition to adding  and accessing attributes, you can also remove them. By passing in the  attribute name, the removeAttribute …  method unbinds the attribute  from the session.   The last session method you should be familiar with is the following:   cid:2  public String getId    This method returns a string containing the unique identifier assigned  to the particular session. One way to use the session ID is for storage of  session information to a persistent data source. This is most useful when  the session is transferred from one web container to another.  Although using sessions might seem as simple as adding and accessing   attributes, there is more to managing them efficiently. Chapter 6, “Session  Management,” discusses the various ways to handle a session and the benefits  from one approach versus another. For now, let’s continue talking about  servlet basics such as its life cycle.  A vendor who intends to provide server support for servlets must   create a server application that adheres to the servlet specification. The  specification calls for the server to maintain a container to specific tasks.  Generally the container is a part of the web server, however, it can be an  external entity. The container is responsible for managing the servlets con- tained within its environment. This means that the container determines:   cid:2  When a servlet is loaded and instantiated   cid:2  How to directly handle client requests or dispatch them to another   resource   cid:2  When to take a servlet out of service  These stages of the servlet make up the servlet life cycle. Life-cycle  management is a crucial strategy that all containers must implement   The Servlet Life Cycle   Loading and Instantiating   The Servlet Life Cycle 69  successfully to be compliant. The life-cycle methods init … , service … ,  and destroy   are defined in the javax.servlet.Servlet interface,  which all servlets must implement, either directly or indirectly. In this  section, we will discuss the functionality of these methods and the circum- stances in which they are affected.   A servlet can be instantiated when the container starts or when the container  receives a request that needs to be serviced. Before instantiation, the con- tainer locates all the needed classes for the servlet and uses the standard  ClassLoader to load the servlet class itself. There are no restrictions on  where the files can be loaded—a local or remote file system or another  network altogether is acceptable.   After a servlet is loaded, it is ready to be initialized so the servlet can be  invoked when needed. The servlet is instantiated, and its default constructor  is read. There is no reason to include a non-default constructor within a serv- let, because it would never get called. This means that passing initialization  parameters to the servlet must be done another way. After the constructor is  read, the container creates an object called the ServletConfig. It contains  name value parameters defined from within a file  we will discuss the file  later in this section . The ServletConfig object is passed to the Servlet  interface method called:  public void init ServletConfig config                          throws ServletException When this method is called, it actually causes the Servlet’s implementing   class, GenericServlet, to invoke its version of the method. Because the  init …  method contains some configuration logic that is necessary for the  servlet, it is important that the GenericServlet’s init ServletConfig  config  method be processed before any other servlet method is called.   Initially, the servlet was designed to have users override the init …  method  that takes in a ServletConfig object and have the method make a call to  super.init config . Although this does work if you follow directions, it  doesn’t guarantee that the developer will make the parent call. Consequently,  there is a convenience method provided called init   that takes no argu- ments. If you override the no-argument init   method, the container will  automatically call the servlet’s init ServletConfig  method.   70 Chapter 2  cid:2  The Servlet Model  The container will then complete your servlet’s init   method, which  provides the servlet with an opportunity to initialize important resources.  The method within the servlet is as follows:  public void init   throws ServletException Usually, all activities that are performed only one time during the  life of the servlet are included in this method or the constructor. The  init   method differs from the constructor in one major way: when  the init   method is called, the container passes it a ServletConfig  object. Although the init   method that developers override does not take  in arguments, instead, you can gain access to the ServletConfig handle  via the method getServletConfig  . Most importantly, this object pro- vides the servlet access to the name value initialization parameters defined in  the web application’s configuration file, most commonly referred to as the  deployment template descriptor  DTD , or even more commonly as simply  the deployment descriptor. As we will discuss in future chapters, every serv- let must have an associated DTD file that defines all the characteristics of the  servlet; specifically it identifies servlet classes and any needed initialization  parameter values. It is important to note that not every servlet must have an  associated deployment descriptor. Rather, it is the web application that must  provide a general DTD to describe the various servlets being utilized. Within  this file, it is common to define parameter values that a servlet is likely to  use. Instead of hard-coding that information into the source code, you can  include those values in the web.xml file, which is tied to the web application  or the server’s DTD file. Either will not cause the servlet to be recompiled.  Instead, the container or servlet will need to be restarted.   The following is a section of a sample web.xml file. We will show you  how to define the parameters, and how to retrieve them from the init    method.                    CalendarServlet           CalendarServlet                         Year               2001                        The Servlet Life Cycle 71               taxrate               .0725                    The CalendarServlet has two parameter value sets. The actual source  code can access this information during the initialization phase. Again, let’s  look at a section of code from the servlet:  public class CalendarServlet extends HttpServlet {   int year;   double rate;    public void init   throws ServletException {     ServletConfig config = getServletConfig  ;          String yearParam = config.getInitParameter “Year” ;     year = Integer.parseInt yearParam ;          String rateParam = config.getInitParameter “taxrate” ;     rate = Float.parseFloat rateParam ;   } } By using the getInitParameter   method of the ServletConfig object,   you can access the value of the specified name passed in as an argument.   An additional benefit to the ServletConfig object is that it grants you   access to the following information:  ServletContext  By using the getServletContext   method, you  can get a handle to this object, which provides the servlet with the  means to communicate with the container. For example, by using the  ServletContext, the servlet can ask the container to get the MIME type  of a file by using the method getMimeType String file , dispatch  requests by using the method getRequestDispatcher String path ,  or write to a log file by using the method log String msg .  Servlet name By using the getServletName   method, you receive the  name of the servlet instance. It is provided by either the deployment  descriptor or its default class name.   72 Chapter 2  cid:2  The Servlet Model  The ServletConfig object is available to the servlet after the init     method is called. However, several problems can occur within the  init   method that can prevent the servlet from entering service. Here  are three such possible scenarios:    cid:2  The first scenario occurs when the init   method throws a   ServletException. This usually happens if there is an initialization  failure—for example, if the container fails to find the initialization  parameters. Failure to initialize would cause the servlet to be released  from the container.    cid:2  Another exception that can be thrown is an UnavailableException,   which is a subclass of ServletException. This usually happens  when you are looking to see whether a service is accessible—and  it’s not. If this particular exception is thrown, the container must  wait a minimal time period before attempting to create and initialize  a new instance of the servlet. There is no need to wait if a  ServletException is thrown.    cid:2  The final situation occurs when the init   method does not return in  a specified time period defined by the web server. If no problems occur,  the servlet is ready for the next phase of its life cycle: service … .  The init   method must complete successfully before the servlet can   begin to receive requests. After that state is achieved, the servlet will either  wait for a request to come through, or immediately begin processing any  pending client requests.   After the init   method completes successfully, the service …  method  is next in line. Most often the container initializes servlets but waits for  requests before activating the servlet. Yes, it is possible for the server to ini- tialize, invoke, and cache a servlet without a request, but this process is less  common. Usually the container waits to receive a request before doing  anything with the servlet. When a request comes in, it is converted to a  ServletRequest object and passed to the service …  method of the serv- let. If the container receives an HTTP request, the object is cast to an  HttpServletRequest object and then passed to the service …  method.   Here are the method signatures: protected void service ServletRequest req,                      ServletResponse res      throws ServletException, IOException  Request Handling   The Servlet Life Cycle 73  or  public void service HttpServletRequest req,                     HttpServletResponse res      throws ServletException, IOException  The purpose of the service …  method is to enable the servlet to respond  to a request. If an HTTP request is sent, the service …  method is respon- sible for dispatching the request to the appropriate doXXX …  method.  Because servlets often run in multithreaded containers, developers should   take threading issues into consideration if this method is overridden. It is  quite likely that the same service method will be accessed by multiple  requests. In such cases, it is important to know how the container handles  concurrent access. Does it pool its servlets or does it serialize requests and  have them wait in a queue? From the developer’s standpoint, you can imple- ment the SingleThreadModel interface or synchronize access to all shared  resources. These topics are covered in great detail in Chapter 8, “Thread- Safe Servlets.”  The final detail of the service …  method is its exceptions. Once again,   the ServletException can be thrown if some error occurred while a  request was processed. It is the responsibility of the container to clean up any  partially generated code in such an event. Like the init …  method, the  service …  method can also throw an UnavailableException, a subclass  of the ServletException class. This usually occurs if the servlet is tempo- rarily or permanently unable to handle the request. If the condition is  permanent, the container removes the servlet from service and calls the  destroy   method  which we discuss next  to release the instance. If, how- ever, the lack of availability is temporary, the container might halt all  requests to that servlet during that temporary period. If a request is refused,  the container will send a response with a Retry-After header and a  SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE 503  status. It is also possible that the container  might treat all unavailability as permanent and remove all servlets from  service when the UnavailableException is thrown.   Completion of the service …  method results in a call to the servlet’s   appropriate doXXX …  method. At that point, the servlet can either generate  the response entirely on its own, or pass part or all of the responsibility to  another servlet.  Request Dispatching  A common feature in web applications is the forwarding of a request from  one servlet to another servlet for processing. This process is called request  dispatching. The ServletRequest interface handles this process by providing    74 Chapter 2  cid:2  The Servlet Model  a method that gives access to the RequestDispatcher object. That method  is as follows:   RequestDispatcher getRequestDispatcher String path  The argument to the getRequestDispatcher method is a string that   describes the relative or absolute path of the ServletContext for which you  are forwarding the request; basically it’s the receiving servlet’s URI or URL.  As a reminder, the ServletContext is the object used to communicate with  the container.  If accessing the RequestDispatcher through a handle to the   ServletContext object is more feasible, you can use the following method:   RequestDispatcher getNamedDispatcher String name  Because there is only one context per web application, there are some   rules about where a request can be dispatched:    cid:2  The relative path cannot extend outside the current servlet context. To  do so, you must use the getContext   method. It returns the absolute  URL to the context requested.   cid:2  A servlet cannot dispatch a request to a context on another server.  The semantics of the path are as follows:   cid:2  If the path begins with a forward slash    , it is considered relative to   the current context.   cid:2  If the path contains a query string, the name value pairs will be added   to the receiving servlet’s parameter list.   There is also a method for getRequestDispatcher String  in the   ServletContext interface. It was introduced in the 2.1 API and accepted  only absolute URL paths for the string parameter. Because the  ServletRequest version is more current  API 2.2  and accepts both relative  and absolute paths, it is the preferred choice.  The second method, getNamedDispatcher String , enables the devel- oper to get the RequestDispatcher for a resource by specifying its name  rather than path. The name can be accessed in several ways: it can be  hard-coded, in the DTD, or as an attribute of the request. If the name of  the servlet cannot be found, the method returns a null. Here is an example  of how the two methods differ:    code snippet public class ServletOne extends HttpServlet {   The Servlet Life Cycle 75    public void doGet HttpServletRequest req,                     HttpServletResponse res      throws ServletException, IOException {       String uri = “ servlet ServletTwo”;       RequestDispatcher reqDis1 =                  req.getRequestDispatcher uri ;        String name = “ServletTwo”;       RequestDispatcher reqDis2 =            getServletContext  .getNamedDispatcher name ;         String query = “ servlet ServletTwo?name=Roney”;       RequestDispatcher reqDis3 =                  req.getRequestDispatcher query ;   } } The first two examples should return the same dispatcher. The third exam- ple simply shows how a query string can be attached to the URI. In order for  these parameters to be sent with the request, the forward ServletRequest  req, ServletResponse res  or include ServletRequest req,  ServletResponse res  method must be called. If the query is not passed  to the getRequestDispatcher …  method, it can be acquired from the  original request object and passed via the forward …  or include …   method.  include  …  When dispatching a request to another resource, the calling servlet might  want to retain control of the response. Here is the method signature:  public void include ServletRequest req,                     ServletResponse res      throws ServletException, IOException The include …  method enables the calling servlet to modify the   response object before and after the call to the include …  method. For  example, let’s take a look at a code sample from a servlet that communicates  magic tricks to its audience: … public void doGet HttpServletRequest req,                   HttpServletResponse res    76 Chapter 2  cid:2  The Servlet Model    throws ServletException, IOException {     res.setContentType “text html” ;     PrintWriter out = res.getWriter  ;     out.println “  Welcome to the Magic Show       ” ;     out.println “ ” ;     out.println “Watch the video stream below: “ ;       RequestDispatcher disp =      req.getRequestDispatcher “ servlet MagicVideo?video=1” ;     disp.include req, res ;      out.println “Tune in daily for a new trick” ;     out.println “  ” ; } …  In this example, the calling servlet simply provides the framework while   the target servlet, MagicTrickVideo, handles the video streaming. The  target servlet cannot change the response status code or set headers;  any attempt to make a change is ignored. The target can, however, process  the request because it does gain access to the request object, via the  getAttribute …  method. Here are the attributes that a target servlet can  access when invoked through an include … :   cid:2  request_uri   cid:2  context_path   cid:2  servlet_path   cid:2  path_info   cid:2  query_string  Unfortunately, these variables are assigned values only if you access the   target servlet by using the request object’s getRequestDispatcher …   method. The getNamedDispatcher …  method leaves these values unset.   If it is necessary for the target servlet to have more control over the   request, the forward …  method proves to be more useful. The drawback  is that any output from processing of the originating servlet after the  forward …  method is called is not displayed.   The Servlet Life Cycle 77  forward  …  The forward …  method is used to forward a request to another servlet. The  originating servlet can perform some preliminary functions on the request  and have another servlet generate the response. The act of having another  servlet perform the task is invisible to the client.   Here is the method signature: public void forward ServletRequest req,                     ServletResponse res       throws ServletException, IOException  Here is an example servlet that calls another servlet to generate a   response:  import java.io*; import javax.servlet.*; import javax.servlet.http.*;  public class PassMessageServlet extends HttpServlet {   public void doGet HttpServletRequest req,                       HttpServletResponse res       throws ServletException, IOException {       req.setAttribute "message", "Life is good" ;         RequestDispatcher disp=            req.getRequestDispatcher " servlet Test" ;       disp.forward req, res ;   } } Within the doGet … , the PassMessageServlet uses the   setAttribute …  method to store an element called message with a value  of Life is good in the request. It then dispatches this request to a servlet  called Test. Let’s take a look at that code:  import java.io; import javax.servlet.*; import javax.servlet.http.*;  public class Test extends HttpServlet {   78 Chapter 2  cid:2  The Servlet Model    public void doGet HttpServletRequest req,                       HttpServletResponse res      throws ServletException, IOException {            String theMessage =            String req.getAttribute "message" ;       res.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = res.getWriter  ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " + theMessage                               + "  " ;       out.close  ;   } } The output for this example displays the message “Life is good.”  The rules associated to a forward …  call are as follows:   cid:2  The forward …  method can be called only if output has not been  committed to the client; otherwise, an IllegalStateException is  thrown.   cid:2  The calling servlet can set headers and set status code information. But   it must send the same request and response objects to the target.   cid:2  If the response buffer contains data that has not been committed, a call   to forward …  will clear the buffer before calling the service …   method of the target servlet.    cid:2  The target servlet must send and commit its response before the   forward …  method can return.  In summary, the forward …  method passes the response responsibility  to the target servlet. The calling servlet can set attributes and access request  information, but it cannot commit the response. Any response data defined  before or after the forward will be ignored.  End of Service  The container can give life, and it can take it away. The longevity of a  servlet’s life is not defined. The container can keep a servlet alive for a few  milliseconds, or the lifetime of the container. When the time comes to remove    The Servlet Life Cycle 79  a servlet from service, the container calls the Servlet interface’s destroy    method. Here is the method signature:   public void destroy   This method is used to release all resources, such as threads or connec- tions, and save any persistent data. A container might choose to remove a  servlet before the system is shut down or as a measure to conserve memory  resources. But before the destroy   method can be called, the container  must wait for all threads running in the service …  method to complete  or time out. After a servlet is destroyed, and its destroy   method has  been called, the servlet is ready for garbage collection. Consequently, the  container cannot send any requests to that servlet. It would need to create  a new instance.  The Exotic Bird Encyclopedia  Exotic Birds, Inc. has a website that provides users with the latest information  on a wide range of bird species. Their website is designed to have the user first  select the type of bird in question, and then to choose the topics of information  they are interested in learning. The site offers information on personalities,  habitat, nutrition, training tips, latest research, and related stories.  Because the application was developed with expandability in mind, a serv- let for each topic was created. Each servlet retrieves specific information on  its topic from an appropriate database source. The ResearchServlet is a  prime example. In order to present the most accurate and current informa- tion on research studies, Exotic Birds, Inc. established an agreement with  the National Zoo. Consequently, their ResearchServlet accesses the zoo’s  remote server to acquire its information. A main servlet links these individ- ual servlets together by using a RequestDispatcher. After the client  determines what information they are interested in, a request is sent to the  server. The main servlet determines what topics are of interest and has  the RequestDispatcher invoke the appropriate servlets to generate and  acquire the information. The main servlet then formats the response page  and returns it to the client. The user can then see all the latest information  to help them learn more about the specific bird they selected.   80 Chapter 2  cid:2  The Servlet Model  Summary  In this chapter, we covered the details associated with the Servlet model.   Specifically we discussed:   cid:2  HTTP-to-servlet method mapping: doGet … , doPost … , doPut … ,   doHead … , doDelete … , doOptions … , doTrace …    cid:2  Servlet request and response interface and method associations   cid:2  The servlet life cycle: init  , service … , destroy     cid:2  The include …  and forward …  methods of the   RequestDispatcher class.  In this chapter, we took foundation topics developed in Chapter 1 and  connected them to the servlet. We traced the request from the client to the  actual servlet. From the HTML trigger, the HTTP request is sent to the  service …  method of a servlet. The container either creates a new servlet  for the request or activates an inactive servlet loaded into memory. After the  servlet passes through the service …  method, its action is determined and  it is then sent to its associated doXXX …  method. It is this method that pro- cesses the request or sends the request to another servlet for processing by  using the RequestDispatcher. After the servlet completes its task, a  response might be sent, and the servlet is either destroyed or returned to an  inactive state. The Servlet model effectively connects HTML code to server- side Java code.   Be able to identify the corresponding HttpServlet class methods for  GET, POST, and PUT requests. The HTTP requests are directly mapped  to methods in the HttpServlet class.   A GET request generates a call to the doGet HttpServletRequest  req, HttpServletResponse res  method.  A POST request generates a call to the doPost HttpServletRequest  req, HttpServletResponse res  method.  Exam Essentials   Exam Essentials 81  A PUT request generates a call to the doPut HttpServletRequest  req, HttpServletResponse res  method.  Be able to identify the interface and methods used to retrieve the  request’s HTML form parameters, initialization parameters, and header  information. To retrieve HTML form parameters from a request,  the javax.servlet.ServletRequest interface provides the following  methods:  getParameter String name   getParameterNames    getParameterValues String name   To retrieve a servlet’s initialization parameters  defined within the deploy- ment descriptor, the javax.servlet.ServletRequest  interface  provides the following method:  getParameter String  name   To retrieve HTTP request header information, the javax.servlet .http.HttpServletRequest interface provides the following methods:  getHeader String name   getHeaderNames    getHeaders String name   getDateHeader String name   getIntHeader String name   getContentType    getMethod    Be able to identify the interface and methods used to set an HTTP response  header and content type. The javax.servlet.HttpServletResponse  interface provides the following methods used to modify the header data:  setHeader String name, String value   setIntHeader String name, int value    setStatus int sc   setDateHeader String name, long date    82 Chapter 2  cid:2  The Servlet Model  The javax.servlet.http.ServletResponse interface provides the  following method used to modify the content type:  setContentType String type    Be able to identify the interface and methods used to acquire the binary or  text streams. The javax.servlet.ServletResponse interface pro- vides the getOutputStream   method to acquire a binary stream. The  javax.servlet.ServletResponse interface provides the getWriter    method to acquire a text stream.  Be able to identify the interface and methods used to redirect an  HTTP request to another URL. The javax.servlet.http .HttpServletResponse interface provides the sendRedirect String  location  method.  Be able to identify the interface and methods used to access values and  resources, and set object attributes within a request. There are a variety  of methods defined for a request object in the classes javax.servlet  .ServletRequest and javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest.  Earlier, we discussed how to get header, date, and parameter information.  In addition to those methods, you need to be familiar with this list:   The first set of methods is used for getting and setting attributes.  Attributes are data objects that can be associated to a request and  retrieved by using a key.   getAttribute String name   getAttributeNames    setAttribute String name, Object value   The next set of methods relates to path information:   getContextPath    getServletPath    getPathInfo    For absolute paths, you can use the following methods:  getRealPath String path    getPathTranslated      Exam Essentials 83  The following methods help determine regional information of the client  machine:  Finally, it is important to be able to acquire more information from the  client by using the following request method to retrieve cookies:  getLocale     getLocales     getCookies    To add cookies to the response, use:  addCookie Cookie cookie    Be able to identify the life-cycle methods of a servlet—which indicate  why, how, and when the servlet is invoked. The servlet container man- ages the life of the servlets contained within. It is important to understand  when each servlet method is invoked and its purpose. A servlet’s life cycle  methods consist of the following:   init    destroy    service HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp   doXXX HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp   Be able to identify how the include and forward methods of the  RequestDispatcher work. When there is a need to forward a task to  another servlet for completion, the RequestDispatcher can handle the  job. By acquiring the RequestDispatcher object from the servlet, you  can use two methods to transfer duties: the include …  method and the  forward …  method. The choice between the two methods depends  strictly on what you are looking to have done and by whom.   84 Chapter 2  cid:2  The Servlet Model  Key Terms  Before you take the exam, be certain you are familiar with the follow-  ing terms:  attribute  container  content type  context  context path  cookie  deployment descriptor  deployment template descriptor   DTD   path info     request  request dispatching  response  ServletConfig  servlet life cycle  Servlet model  servlet path  session object   Review Questions  Review Questions 85  1.

ServletRequest  C. ServletConfig  D. ServletResponse   90 Chapter 2  cid:2  The Servlet Model  Answers to Review Questions  1. B, C.  There is a doHead …  method defined by the servlet spec. In   2.3, it is a protected method, which means you can include the method  in your servlet code if you extend HttpServlet. This would result in  a call to your servlet’s doHead …  method. The third option is false  because a GET request does not invoke the doHead …  method; it  invokes the doGet …  method instead.  2. A, B.  The doPost …  method is defined in the HttpServlet class  with a protected access modifier. When overriding a method, you can  change the modifier to one that is more public. That eliminates the  last option. The third option fails because the parameters passed are  HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse. Finally, the first  two answers are correct because you can override a method and throw  fewer exceptions than that of your parent, or you could match the  signature exactly.   3. D.  A PUT request is used to publish resources at a location on the   server. This method calls its corresponding doPut …  method in the  servlet to help perform this task.  4. E.  As per the servlet spec 2.3, all methods described handle the   HTTP request methods defined. Consequently, the answer is “None  of the above.”   5. C.  The doPost …  method is called when an HTTP POST is submit- ted. The two arguments passed in are an HttpServletRequest and  HttpServletResponse.   6. A.  The getHeader   method returns a string representation of the  entire value. Consequently, all values are grouped into one string  object. The method getHeaders   parses the values and returns them  in an array.  7. C.  If the header value cannot be converted to a date, then an   IllegalArgumentException is thrown.  8. A, C.  Because the HttpServletRequest interface extends   ServletRequest, it too has access to the getParameterNames    method.    Answers to Review Questions 91  9. A, B.  Both the doGet …  and doHead …  methods should be written to  be safe, meaning the user should not be held accountable if the request is  processed. They should also be idempotent, which means no negative  side effects should occur if the request is processed multiple times.  10. B.  A forward …  is used to forward responsibility to complete the  response to another servlet. If the calling servlet adds data to the response  buffer, the target servlet erases that information. Consequently, you  see the output from the target response stream only.  11. C.  A forward …  call is a blocking method. This means the target  servlet must commit or send its response before control can be returned  to the forwarding servlet.   12. B, C.  The first option fails because getParameter String name   returns only a value associated to the parameter name passed. The  getAttribute …  method takes in a key string and returns a single  value set by a request using the setAttribute …  method. To retrieve  all attributes in an enumeration, simply call getAttributes  .  13. D.  The context path defines the path of the context for which the  servlet resides. If the context is defined to be at the base of the web  server’s URL namespace, then the context is an empty string. If that is  the case, then  cars sportsCars represents the servlet path, and the  context path is blank. If that is not the case, then  cars is the context  path. Because you don’t know where the context was defined, you  have no choice but to select the last option.  14. D.  The path info returned is the data between the servlet path and  query string. Because the servlet is called Search and the query string  begins immediately after, the method getPathInfo   returns null.  15. A, C.  The ServletConfig interface has a method called   getServletContext   that returns a handle to the ServletContext  object. You can obtain a handle to this object through the HttpServlet  class as well. Its parent class, GenericServlet, also has the same  method defined, getServletContext  .                                              Servlet Web  Applications  Chapter  3  THE FOLLOWING SUN CERTIFIED WEB  COMPONENT DEVELOPER FOR J2EE  PLATFORM EXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED IN THIS CHAPTER:  2.1 Identify the structure of a web application and web archive  file, the name of the WebApp deployment descriptor, and the  name of the directories where you place the following:  The WebApp deployment descriptor The WebApp class files Any auxiliary JAR files  2.2 Match the name with a description of purpose or  functionality, for each of the following deployment descriptor  elements:  Servlet instance Servlet name Servlet class Initialization parameters URL to named servlet mapping   cid:1    cid:1    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2                                         Understanding a Web Application  I  n order for an application to be accessible by a container, the   many resources that make up the application must be strategically placed in  a predefined directory structure. In this chapter, we will classify the various  parts of a web application and identify where these parts must be placed. The  directory layout is the key behind the container’s ability to locate the data  it needs.   Other configuration information is stored within a file specific to each  web application. The container accesses this file to determine the purpose,  location, and behavior of various resources. We will point out how to format  this file and the tags used to communicate between the web application and  the container.  t takes many pieces to make a final program that is accessible through  web  . A single application can consist of any or all of the following   the Web. These pieces, when grouped together, are referred to as the  application elements:  I   cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2   Servlets  JSP pages  Utility classes   Static documents   Client-side Java applets, beans, and classes  A standard configuration file  required                            Understanding a Directory Structure  95  A standard J2EE application can contain many servlets and or JSP pages.  The utility classes help execute these server programs, and the static docu- ments provide a more aesthetic appeal to the client application. The client  application might also incorporate other Java classes, such as business  objects, or applets to help deliver the desired program. Finally, all web appli- cations must contain a standard configuration file to help the server identify  each object’s purpose and structure.   In addition to informing the server about the details associated with each  class, it is imperative that the web application be portable. If the application  is placed on a new or different server, it should execute successfully with  minimal administrative work. You can ensure successful execution by creating  a standard directory structure and configuration file for a web application. All  the server needs to do is use the directory structure to locate the application  classes in their defined directories and then use the web application’s configu- ration file to identify any configuration settings that need to be applied to  needed resources. The server can then execute the application, and in the end,  portability is achieved.   G  rouping web application classes and files into a structured direc- tory hierarchy provides the web server with a map to find the appropriate  resource. This hierarchical structure is defined by the servlet specification  but leaves the choice of implementation up to the vendor creating the con- tainer. While recommended by the specification, it is not required that all  servlet containers adhere to this organizational pattern; however, in order  for the servlet container to be certified by Sun, it must adhere to the servlet  specification. The good news is that most servlet vendors choose to accept  the defined format. More importantly, the exam will test your knowledge  of the standard directory structure. In this section, we will discuss each  layer of the hierarchy and the proper placement of each web application  object.  The hierarchy is made up of three significant layers. The first is the context.  It is one or more directories used to locate the web application associated   directory,  to the client request. Within the context exists the  which marks another layer. It contains several subdirectories that help    WEB-INF  Understanding a Directory Structure                                                           96  Chapter 3  cid:2   Servlet Web Applications  The Context   WEB-INF  organize class files and compressed Java files. The  contains a document that maps all files and defines characteristics of the  entire application. This layer is hidden from the client. This means the client  cannot directly access files from within the   directory. The final  layer is quite the opposite. It is located directly within the context and con- tains all client-viewable files. This includes welcome and error pages, graphic  or audio files, and so forth.    directory also    WEB-INF  A single web server can run multiple applications. Each application is usually  contained within a directory called the root, or  . For example, you  might have a chat servlet that is made up of multiple directories containing  20 classes and files. All those files and directories will then be placed in one   directory is then defined as the  directory called  context for this web application. The name of the created directory is arbi- trary; however, the location of this directory is server dependent. The server  determines how to point to the context.    chatApp   chatApp  context  . The   The Tomcat reference implementation provides an automatic    webapps   directory are automatically   directory structure, whereby all directories placed inside the  tomcat-installation-directory configured as web applications. Now, you are not forced to use this  directory. You can point the context to another location, but that location  must be defined in both the server and application configuration files.  JRun, another web server by Macromedia, allows the developer to define  the context by specifying the directory name or using a GUI wizard tool to  specify the application directory. Basically, the location of the context can  be customized.   The context itself is the root for a single web application.  Table 3.1 lists some context examples.  From this example, you can see that the parent directory can be any direc-  tory, as long as its location is communicated to the server. The context is  a directory defined by the developer, and again, its information must be  mapped to the server.

When a request is sent from the client, the container must find the appro- priate web application to handle the task. In doing so, the web application  finds the longest context path that matches the start of the request URL. The  container then locates the servlet by using the following mapping rules in  the order they are performed.  Assuming that the “servlet path pattern” defines the request URL and the  “incoming path” defines the longest context path match, the servlet container  will try to find:  Exact mapping a match:   All strings match exactly. Here is an example of   Servlet path pattern:    foo bar  Incoming path:    foo bar  Path mapping a forward slash and asterisk   requested.   The string begins with a forward slash     and ends with     . The longest match determines the servlet    *  Here is an example of a match:  Servlet path pattern:    programs wordprocessing *  Incoming path:    programs wordprocessing index.html  Incoming path:    programs wordprocessing wp2.4 start.jsp                                                                                                       98  Chapter 3  cid:2   Servlet Web Applications  Extension mapping  The string begins with an asterisk    . *  Here is an example of a match:  Servlet path pattern:   *.jsp  Incoming path:    catalog order start.jsp  Incoming path:    catalog form.jsp  Incoming path:    test.jsp  The container provides server content appropriate   Default mapping  for the resource request, such as a default servlet. The string begins with   , and the servlet path is the requested URI minus the  a forward slash     context path. The path info is   . null  Here is an example of a match:  Servlet path pattern:    sport  Incoming path:    sport index.html  Containers often have implicit mapping mechanisms built into their systems.  For example, a container might have   extensions mapped to enable JSP  pages to be executed on demand. The keynote is that explicit mapping by a web  application or servlet takes precedence over implicit mapping.   *.jsp  Request mapping is case sensitive.  WEB-INF  For every web application, there must be a public directory called  .   WEB-INF This directory contains the main files for the application that are not pro- vided to the client by the container. For example, a graphics file would not  be included here because that is something provided to the client. However,  a servlet used to calculate data would be stored somewhere within the   WEB-INF   directory structure.  Through the  getServletContext    ServletContext   object, which the servlet acquires by using   method, a servlet can access files and code in the   the               Understanding a Directory Structure  99   WEB-INF   directory by using the following methods:   cid:2  URL getResource String path    cid:2  InputStream getResourceAsStream String path   Typically, these methods are used to include the output from other appli- cation resources into the current application. Either a URL or InputStream  object is returned to the resource mapped in the path parameter. Basically,  if an application developer wants to access another resource without expos- ing that file to the web client, they can do so by using these methods.  There are three main categories for content in the  WEB-INF directory:   WEB-INF web.xml This contains the deployment descriptor.   WEB-INF classes This directory contains all the server-side Java  classes, such as servlet and utility classes.   WEB-INF lib *.jar The  lib directory contains all necessary com- pressed Java files that are used for the web application. These files are  referred to as Java archive files or JAR files. They can consist of servlets,  JSPs, beans, and utility classes.  When loading classes from the  WEB-INF directory, the ClassLoader first  loads from the  classes directory and then the  lib directory.   Web Application Archive File  WAR File   When distributing a web application, it is convenient to deliver one file  that contains all the necessary classes and resources utilizing the standard  directory structure. A web archive  WAR  file is like a JAR in that it com- presses all necessary classes and resources recursively in their directories into  a single file. A JAR file is a compressed file used for a standard Java appli- cation or related classes. A WAR file is a compressed file used for a standard  web application and its related classes. The technique used to create a WAR  file is the same as a JAR. You can create a WAR file by using the following  command-line statement:  jar -cvf ShoppingCart.war * Or you can extract a WAR file by using the following command: jar -xvf ShoppingCart.war   100 Chapter 3  cid:2  Servlet Web Applications  Notice that the jar command is used to create and extract a WAR file.  The second argument is a list of options telling the command what to do and  how. Generally, you should be familiar with the basic options available after  the minus sign. They are outlined in Table 3.2.  T A B L E 3 . 2 WAR Options  Option  Definition  c  x  t  v  f  Create  Extract  Table of contents  Verbose  Target file  One of the first three options  c, x, or t  will be used to define the action.  Either you are looking to create  c  a WAR file, extract  x  the contents of the  WAR file, or list the table of contents  t  from a specific WAR file.   The v  verbose  option is usually used to display the output of the   command as it is taking place. The f  file  option denotes that the name  of the WAR or JAR file will be defined in the next section of the command.   For additional options, refer to the following site: %JDK_HOME% docs  tooldocs win32 jar.html or $JDK_HOME\docs\tooldocs\solaris\jar.html   where %JDK_HOME% and $JDK_HOME represent the path to the JDK installation  directory .   The minus sign in front of the options is not mandatory. It is used only as  a convention carried forward from Unix. The option tags can be placed in  any order.  The third item in the preceding command line is the name of the WAR file.  It should end with a .war extension. Finally, if you are creating a file, the last  item consists of a single directory or multiple directories, separated by  spaces, which will be compressed into the WAR file.   Understanding a Directory Structure 101  Syntactically, the only difference between the two files types, a JAR and  a WAR, is the extension. So why make two file types? Well, their purposes  are very different. A JAR file is a compressed file containing resources and  classes for a Java application. A WAR file is a compressed file containing  resources and classes for a web application. The distinction is significant, in  that the container is designed to look for different features for a WAR file  than those for a JAR file. In order for a container to execute a WAR file, it  should be placed in the server’s default or configured directory used to hold  all web applications.  Most servers provide a default directory for all WAR file applications. Placing  a WAR file in this directory causes the server to automatically load the appli- cation into its context. Some vendors provide an additional feature, whereby  they allow the placement of WAR files in another directory outside the default  directory. Restarting the server will result in the loading of all WAR files from  default and configured directories.  Because the WAR file contains all recursive directories needed to use the  web application, starting with the context directory, the WAR file should  placed in the web server’s application root directory—the one preceding  the context.  When developing a web application, creating a WAR file might not be  practical because classes need to be recompiled, reloaded, and tested.  Usually the WAR file is created during the packaging and production  stages of a project.  Client-Viewed Files  All files that the container can send to the client are located in the context or  subdirectories other than the  WEB-INF or  META-INF directories.   The  META-INF directory is the meta information directory and contains, at a  minimum, one file named MANIFEST.MF  the manifest file . The manifest file  contains “meta” information pertinent to the classes that are included within  the WAR JAR file, such as digital signature information, version control  information, and package sealing information.    102 Chapter 3  cid:2  Servlet Web Applications  Digital signature files are also located in the  META-INF directory, but have the  extension of .sf, which stands for “signature file.”  The default servlet starting page, usually referred to as index.html, is  often located directly in the context directory. It is also common to have a  graphics or images directory, which contains pictured to display on the web  client, within the context directory. Here is a sample directory layout of the  different files contained within a single web application:  webapps test index.html webapps test instructions.jsp webapps test comments.jsp webapps test images logo.gif webapps test images smileyFace.gif webapps test WEB-INF lib testTabular.jar webapps test WEB-INF classes com      spiderProductions servlet TestServlet.class webapps test WEB-INF classes com      spiderProductions util Utilities.class If you compress the files and directories of the test context into a WAR file  called testApp.war, the file will be placed in the root application directory  as  webapps testApp.war. The WAR file will contain everything from the  test directory down.  The Botanical Application  The Botanical Market in upstate New York has developed a thriving online  business by selling a variety of rare herbs to the general population. Their  website is simple, informative, and efficient. The developers focused their  efforts on designing a web application that is portable because the company  predicts future upgrades as their revenues grow.  In structuring the web application, the developers placed all static and JSP  files in the context directory. Because they were accessing a database, which  contained the inventory and order information, some servlets needed Java  Database Connectivity  JDBC  calls. The drivers to the database were in  JAR format, so they were placed in the context WEB-INF lib  directory.  The servlets, such as the HerbServlet, the OrderServlet, and the UserServlet,    Using Deployment Descriptor Tags 103  were placed in the context WEB-INF classes  directory. After all pieces were  placed in their appropriate locations, and the product was ready for pro- duction, the developers compressed the web application into a file called  HerbApp.war starting at the context directory. That single file now resides  in the current web server’s default application directory.  The benefit of configuring the web application to meet the standard direc- tory structure is that it will require very little administrative work to relocate  the application to a new web server when the company chooses to upgrade.  In an ideal setting, it should be as easy as moving the WAR file to the new  server’s application directory.  Using Deployment Descriptor Tags  A container can contain multiple web applications. But for each web   application, there must exist only one deployment descriptor, also referred  to as a web.xml. This file identifies and maps the resources for a single web  application and is stored at the root of the  WEB-INF directory. Written  in Extensible Markup Language  XML , the web.xml utilizes predefined  tags to communicate resources and information for use by the web appli- cation. All commercial web servers will generate the web.xml file by using  a GUI administration tool. Although this makes life a little easier for the  developer, it is still the developer’s responsibility to be able to understand the  various tags and modify the file manually if changes or errors occur.  In this section, we will discuss the basic tags used to construct a web.xml  file. We will then identify the tags used to map a request to a servlet and tran- sition to tags that identify a servlet and its parameters. We’ll start by show- ing you a complete but simple web.xml  see Listing 3.1  and then discuss its  tags and purpose in detail.  Listing 3.1: A Sample Deployment Descriptor     <!DOCTYPE web-app PUBLIC “-  SUN Microsystems, Inc.     DTD Web Application 2.3  EN” “http:  java.sun.com    dtd web-app_2_3.dtd”>   104 Chapter 3  cid:2  Servlet Web Applications         Exotic Bird Encyclopedia      <context path=” features” docbase=”       c: projects birdSite features” reloadable=”true”>                      SEARCH_PATH              features utilities                                  Search           SearchServlet                       defaultType             cockatiels             default search value                                  Search            utilities *                        60                        pdf           application pdf                        index.jsp           index.html    Using Deployment Descriptor Tags 105           index.htm           This web.xml file begins by providing versioning information. The first   tag, ?xml, defines the version of the language being used. The character- encoding value is an ISO value and is defined as the Latin standard, which  is used for American English countries. The !DOCTYPE… line indicates the  root  XML element and the location for the document type definition  DTD  spec- ification. A DTD is used to specify the structure of  an XML document and to  validate the document. The standard for a web application is to use the DTD  spec provided by Sun Microsystems, which designates the web-app as the  root element or tag. As you can see in the example, the servlets defined  within the DTD will use the 2.3 or earlier spec. This information helps the  container synchronize with the provided resources.  After the format tags have been defined, you are ready to begin mapping   all resources to the web application. Because the DOCTYPE tag defines the  root element as web-app, you are required to start with the web-app tag to  open the form. Had the DOCTYPE indicated the root element as web-app2,  then the XML document would begin with web-app2. In our example,  all resources are defined between the opening   and closing    tags.   The first set of tags within the web application relate to the context. As  stated earlier, the context defines the root directory for all resources in a  specific web application. The container reads the web.xml file to determine  this location. Within the context tag is an attribute called path. The path  attribute points to the root directory of all resources for the web application.  Because a single web.xml file can utilize multiple servlets, all servlets will  start at the directory defined by the path. The actual location of that direc- tory on the server is expressed via the docbase attribute.  If you don’t include a context tag, the container assumes a default context   of ‘ ’.   Within the opening and closing context tags, you can define parameters   that are available to all servlets within the web application. By using  the ServletContext method getInitParameter … , you can pass in the  param-name and have the param-value returned within the servlet.  Remember, the value is always represented as a String. Usually, the  context-param specifies database drivers, protocol settings, and URL  path information. Although these tags are important, they are not manda- tory. Defining the servlets of the web application is most significant.   106 Chapter 3  cid:2  Servlet Web Applications  Basic Servlet Tags  Initialization Parameters  To define a servlet, the XML document uses the opening   and  closing   tags. All servlet-related characteristics are defined  within these tags, such as the name, class, description, and parameters. When  referring to the various servlets in an application, it is sometimes convenient  to do so by using an alias name—a human name independent of the actual  servlet name that follows the XXXServlet naming standard.          Search       SearchServlet     In this example, we define the alias servlet name as Search, while the   actual servlet class name is SearchServlet. This enables the servlet to be  referred to by a name different from the actual servlet name. Consequently,  if you later changed the servlet class to a servlet class that had a completely  different name, no source code or changes would need to be modified.  For now, let’s complete the servlet tag by looking at how to define servlet  parameters:          Search       SearchServlet                 defaultType           cockatiels           default search value           Although a servlet can contain multiple parameters, they will always  be embedded between a set of    tags. The  init-param tag defines a name, value, and description for a variable that  the outer servlet can access. In our example, the SearchServlet class can  use the getInitParameter "defaultType"  method, inherited from the  GenericServlet class, to get the value cockatiels. The description is  optional but helps describe the variable’s purpose. It is usually only valu- able to GUI tools that will use the description to enable the user to know    Mapping the URL to the Servlet  Using Deployment Descriptor Tags 107  what to enter into the field. The closing   tag closes the  information for the one parameter. If another parameter needed to be  defined, a new set of    tags must be defined.  Finally, the closing servlet tag,  , marks the end of specific  information pertaining to the one servlet.  Before the server container can access a servlet’s parameters, it must first locate  the servlet. When a container is started, it first reads its server’s deployment  descriptor file to determine the server configuration. Then the container  launches all desired web applications, reads the associated web.xml file, and  stores the information in memory. Within the web.xml file, a tag called  servlet-mapping is used to help map requests to actual servlets.   If mapping information is not included, the container will look to default  directories defined by the server’s deployment descriptor to find the speci- fied servlet. For the reference web server implementation Tomcat, the default  directory for all automatically loaded web applications is the directory called  tomcat-installation-directory webapps .   Placing all web applications in a default directory is simple, but is not the  most organized approach. A container that is running complex applications  should be able to locate web applications in designated locations outside the  default directory structure. By using the context and servlet-mapping  tags, you can place a servlet in a specific location and point the container to  that location.  When a request is passed to the container, the header contains a URI   defining the context and path info to the servlet. The context path from the  URI is mapped to the web application’s context path by using the docbase  attribute. Remember that this information was read and stored when the  container first started running. Additional path information is then mapped  to the url-pattern directories defined within the servlet-mapping tag.  Let’s take a closer look at a code snippet from the preceding example:         Search        utilities *      108 Chapter 3  cid:2  Servlet Web Applications  The url-pattern tag identifies the directory path following the context.  Consequently, when a client requests the services of the SearchServlet, the  container will map it to the  features utilities  directory, because it  is the context as defined by the context element in the XML document.  Given the following HTTP request, we will map the container’s path to  find the correct servlet:  http:  localhost:8080 features utilities Search From this request, we can extract the URI: URI = features utilities Search The container then uses a default mapping mechanism to find the servlet:  context_name servlet Servlet_Name The container looks for the context directory  features and finds that it  is located in c: projects birdSite features. The servlet is then mapped  to the url-pattern directory  utilities, and the alias name Search is then  mapped to a class file called SearchServlet. The complete location would  look like the following:   c: projects birdSite features                  utilities SearchServlet.class This example demonstrates how each simple category can create a path to  the servlet. Now, let’s take a look at an example that utilizes packages and  multiple directories for the url-pattern. Based on the information pro- vided, you, like the container, should be able to construct the full path for the  servlet.  context path =  car engines  docbase= c: projects  alias name = TurboRacer servlet-name = com.eei.RaceCarServlet url-pattern =  vehicles fast * By utilizing all the information, you should map the servlet to the follow-  ing location:  c: projects car engines vehicles fast                   com eei RaceCarServlet.class The container takes the url-pattern   vehicles fast  that is associ- ated to the servlet alias name  TurboRacer  and then maps that name to the  actual servlet class  com.eei.RaceCarServlet .   Figure 3.1 breaks down each section graphically. The servlet will be   accessed as long as the container can map the web.xml tag information to the  URI provided by the client request.   Using Deployment Descriptor Tags 109  F I G U R E 3 . 1 URL mapping  c: projects  car engines  vehicles fast  com eei RaceCarServlet.class  docbase  context path  url-pattern  Session Configuration  The servlets located in the  WEB-INF directory are automatically mapped for  the specified application. By using the servlet-mapping element tag, you can  utilize servlets that are not, by default, part of a given application and that  reside in a completely different directory structure.  After a request is mapped to a servlet, an HttpSession object is assigned to  the client. Therefore, if there are 5000 user requests, the container will main- tain 5000 HttpSession objects on the server. If portions of those users are  inactive, then the application is wasting memory resources. A timeout flag  can be set two ways:   cid:2  Within the servlet code, by using the HttpSession object’s method,   setMaxInactiveInterval int     cid:2  Within the web.xml file by using the session-config tag.  The first approach utilizes servlet code to set the maximum number of  seconds a request can remain inactive. The following code snippet demon- strates how this can be done:  … public void doGet HttpServletRequest req,                   HttpServletResponse res     throws ServletException, IOException {     …     HttpSession session = req.getSession  ;     session.setMaxInactiveInterval 60 ;     … } …   110 Chapter 3  cid:2  Servlet Web Applications  The downside to this approach is that when the number of seconds  needs to be modified, the code itself must be recompiled. To solve this  problem, you could use a deployment descriptor parameter value instead  of hard-coding the number of seconds. Now, the question often asked is,  “Why not use the second approach altogether because it uses the deploy- ment descriptor to define the value and exclude the code from the servlet?”  A developer might opt to choose one approach over the other because the  first applies the timeout value to a specific servlet, rather than the entire  web application.  The second approach defines the maximum time all inactive HttpSession  objects can exist through the web.xml file by using the session-config tag.        60    Modifications to the web.xml file do not require the servlet to be recom-  piled. Instead, the container simply needs to be restarted and to reload  the servlet. In both examples, we set the timeout amount to 60 seconds.  Ultimately, they both achieve the same end result—the code authorizes  the container to remove the inactive session from memory after its time  expires.   When transmitting information between the client and server, both parties  need to know the format of the content being transferred. The Multipurpose  Internet Mail Extensions  MIME  type defines the format of the request  or response. A MIME type is a String that defines the type and subtype:  type subtype. Some common examples are text html, text plain,  and image gif.   When a servlet sends a response to a client, the browser needs to know   how to render the information received. Consequently, the server can con- struct a response to notify the client of the MIME type, by using two different  approaches:   cid:2  By using the HttpServletResponse’s method: setContentType …    cid:2  By using the mime-mapping tag in the web.xml file for the web   application   MIME Type Mappings   Using Deployment Descriptor Tags 111  The first approach utilizes servlet code to set the MIME type of the   response. The following code snippet demonstrates how this can be done:  … public void doGet HttpServletRequest req,                   HttpServletResponse res     throws ServletException, IOException {     …     res.setContentType “application pdf” ;     … } … Again, this applies the content type to a specific servlet. To apply the   content type to all public files of a specific extension within an entire web  application, you can use the mime-mapping tag. The following example  demonstrates how the context will automatically associate the application  pdf MIME type with all files with the extension of .pdf:          pdf       application pdf    After the client receives this response, it knows it must use a tool such as   Adobe Acrobat Reader to interpret the .pdf response.  When a website is accessed, the index.html file is usually the first page dis- played. Typically this file is the default page for a website or a web application.  In fact, if a client enters a URL path to a servlet, usually the web server will  automatically change focus to point to the welcome page associated to the  application. For example, if a user enters http:  www.testWebserver .com application, the site switches to http:  www.testWebserver.com  application index.html.   The index.html file is the default welcome page for servlets. Including  the welcome-file-list tag in the web.xml file overrides the server defaults  and enables the container to search for specified welcome pages. A welcome  list can point the web server to alternative display pages.         index.jsp   Welcome File List   112 Chapter 3  cid:2  Servlet Web Applications      start.html      go.html      index.html    The files listed within the welcome-file-list tag apply to the web   application and its subdirectories. Let’s take a look at an example. Imagine  a company with a web application that resides in the root directory called   SpiderInc.com. Its subdirectories and files look similar to the following  structure:    SpiderInc.com             __index.html             __employees                           ____index.jsp  When SpiderInc.com is accessed, the welcome page index.html is dis-  played by default. Now, when the employees  link is accessed, the user  might be prompted for a login and password entry. After access is granted,  then a welcome page could be generated dynamically to acknowledge the  user’s name and information. The welcome page for the employee site is  called index.jsp. In order for the container to associate the index.jsp file  to the welcome page, the file index.jsp must be defined in the web.xml  file with a welcome-file tag. This entry identifies additional filenames for  the container to look for when searching for the welcome page for a site.  In our example, the container will first look for index.html. If it can find  it in the employees  directory, it will look at the first filename in the  welcome-file list and search for that file next. Because index.jsp is  found, the container displays that page to the client. Without the XML entry,  the container would fail to display the starting page because index.html  is not available.   The specification does not address the order in which containers will access  the welcome file list. Generally, most containers start with the first file in the  list when searching for a welcome page. Then again, keep in mind that the  order the files are accessed is container specific.    Summary  Exam Essentials 113  In this chapter, we covered the details associated with the web appli-  cation. We began by addressing the basic directory structure for a web  application. Each resource should be placed in a specific location for the  container to access its information when it is needed. Because the container  doesn’t always find direct matches for the files it is searching, we also  covered the mapping rules a container will use to select the best fit. Finally,  we described how to wrap up the entire application in a WAR file for  production.  The second part of this chapter focused on identifying the most common  deployment descriptor tags. The overall tag list is very large, and we covered  only those that are general to the web application. Specifically, we addressed  tags that apply to the entire application, such as the context, configuration,  MIME type, and welcome tags. In addition to those, we covered tags specific  to the servlets contained within the web application itself.  The web application is made up of multiple pieces. It is important that the   pieces are arranged logically and their purpose is identified to the server.  Exam Essentials  Be able to identify the required files for a web application. A web  application consists of a variety files from the following list:  Servlets  for example, PlaceOrderServlet.class   JSP pages  for example, Receipt.jsp   Utility classes  for example, CalculateTotals.class    Static documents  for example, welcome.html   Client-side Java applets, beans, and classes  for example,  OtherJavaFiles.jar   A standard configuration file  for example, web.xml   Be able to identify the directory structure of a web application. Each  file should be placed in its associated directory. There are two main  directories you should be familiar with: the context  or root  and the   WEB-INF. Files placed directly in the context are visible and accessible to    114 Chapter 3  cid:2  Servlet Web Applications  Key Terms  the client. This is quite the opposite of files located directly in, or in  subdirectories of, the  WEB-INF directory.   Be able to describe a WAR file. A WAR file is a single compressed file  that contains all the contents of a web application. The same mechanisms  used to compress Java applications into JAR files are used to compress  web applications into WAR files. The main difference between the two  files is the name, which identifies how the container should handle them.  A WAR file signifies something very different to a web server than a  JAR file.  Be able to discuss the most commonly used deployment descriptor tags. The deployment descriptor file, or web.xml file, contains a variety of tags  that identify and characterize the resources within a single web applica- tion. Each XML tag communicates a specific meaning to the server.   Before you take the exam, be certain you are familiar with the follow-  ing terms:   META-INF  deployment template descriptor   DTD    WEB-INF classes  exact mapping   WEB-INF lib *.jar  extension mapping   WEB-INF web.xml  Java archive  JAR  file  context  default mapping   path mapping  web application  deployment descriptor  web archive  WAR  file   Review Questions 115  Review Questions  1.

All the objects defined can be included in a web   application.   2. B.  Although it is recommended, it is not mandatory or required that  all servlet containers adhere to the directory structure defined by the  spec. However, to be Sun certified, a servlet container must meet  the requirements of the specification.  3. A.  Although a JAR file contains compressed classes and resources for  a Java application, a WAR file specifically contains these same types  of files, but for a web application.  4. A.  The index.html file is forwarded to the web client. As a result, it  cannot be located in either the  WEB-INF or  META-INF directories, or  any of their subdirectories.   5. D.  All individual classes are located in the  WEB-INF classes direc- tory. If the class is compressed and converted to a JAR file, its JAR file  needs to be placed in the  WEB-INF lib directory.   6. A.  The WAR file is usually stored in the context directory. Within  the file exists the  WEB-INF directory and all its subdirectories. The   META-INF directory must exist within the WAR file as well.   7. D.  The docbase identifies the actual directory starting path for the  servlet. It includes the context path, so there is no need to repeat  the path directory structure. The url-pattern then defines the specific  location of each servlet rather than storing them all at the root. Finally,  the package structure information is incorporated into the path to  locate the end class.  8. A.  The session-timeout tag is used in conjunction with the   session-config tag. It is not specific to a servlet, but rather applies  to all servlets in the defined web application.  9. A, C, D.  The mime-mapping tag applies the MIME type for any file  with the specified file extensions. The init-param is not a correct  answer because it provides parameters for a specific servlet, unlike  the context-param tag. This tag is general to all files in the web  application. Finally, the last option is also correct because the time- out amount defined with the session-config tag applies to all  HttpSession objects.   120 Chapter 3  cid:2  Servlet Web Applications  10. D.  The session-timeout tag identifies the number of seconds a   container must wait before removing an inactive HttpSession object.  11. A.  The getParameter String name  of the ServletRequest  class is used to retrieve the value associated to the name passed  in for a specific servlet. This should not be confused with the  getInitParameter String name  method found in the  ServletContext class and used to retrieve context parameters.  12. B.  When the string passed into the getInitParameter  String   name  method cannot be matched to a param-name tag, null is  returned.  13. C.  The mime-mapping tag identifies the MIME type for files with the   14. C.  All Java archive files are read from the  lib directory, which is   specified file extensions.   located inside  WEB-INF.  15. D.  When matching URL names to their respective files or directories,  the casing is important. This is best explained when trying to match  Java files. A servlet called MyServlet.class is different from one  called Myservlet.class. The next two options are true as well,  because containers resort to default mapping techniques and are  often built with implicit mapping mechanisms  as defined by the  specification .

Depending on its placement, a parameter or attribute  is accessible by various pieces of an application. In this chapter, we are going  to provide a close look at how data is affected when it is stored at different  levels of an application. The first level is global to all resources within the  application, and it is known as the context. The second level exists during  the life of a client’s connection, and is commonly referred to as the session.  Finally, we will conclude by addressing how data within these different areas  is affected when the application is run in a distributed environment.   At all three levels, we will discuss how parameters and attributes can   be accessed and manipulated. We will show you how either the context or  session can respond to changes in its attributes by using specific listener  interfaces. Specifically, we will discuss what happens when:  The context or session is initialized or destroyed   cid:2    cid:2   Attributes are added, removed, or replaced from a context or session  Our goal is to ensure a thorough understanding of how parameters and  attributes are handled for each object. In addition, you must be familiar with  the specific interfaces and generated events used to respond to changes in  either one’s life-cycle methods or attributes.  ServletContext A  n application usually consists of many resources, such as multiple   servlets, audio files, and static HTML files, to name a few. Maintained  within the container, each resource is generally accessible to the other. How- ever, sometimes the developer’s desire is not to access another resource but                                                                                                               ServletContext  123  rather to allow resources to share data. This can be accomplished using the   object. In this section, we will first discuss the details and  ServletContext  object.

The two interfaces we will discuss are:  ServletContext  ServletContextListener  ServletContextAttributeListener   cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2   The   ServletContext   is a critical object that helps glue all the pieces of an   application together.  ServletConfig  ServletContext  object. The    Methods and Attributes  object con- For each web application, there exists one    tained within the application’s  context object acts as a reference to the web application. When a servlet is initialized, the  container provides it a handle to the context object for the servlet to com- municate with the container. All servlets within the application use the single  context object to access information about the container and server in which  they reside. This information can then be displayed to the client and or used  to change or restrict servlet behaviors. For example, the context can be  used to dispatch a request, write to a log file, or simply learn about the serv- let version being supported. The context can be accessed by the servlet  directly or indirectly. Because all servlets extend an implementation of the  GenericServlet   class, they have direct access to the following method:  This method returns the  ServletContext getServletContext   single context object associated with the entire web application. This  method is originally defined in the   interface, which the   class implements.

The current specification no longer provides handles to other servlets  within the application. Those methods have been deprecated and return  empty or null values. The only direct link that is currently provided by the  context is a handle to the  , to forward a task, and streams  used to either write log information or read objects.  RequestDispatcher  The context enables the developer or assembler to define values that apply   to the entire web application. They can define either parameter values or  attribute values.   String  Parameter values usually define the application’s configuration informa- tion at deployment time. The value associated with the name is represented  as a  ; however, it can be converted to an appropriate object under the  correct circumstances. For example, a parameter might provide a hidden  file or image path and name that servlets might be interested in loading at  some point, or it might simply provide an e-mail address to the application’s  webmaster.

If there                                      ServletContext  125  The following code snippet shows how a servlet might access this param-  eter value:  … public void doGet HttpServletRequest req,                   HttpServletResponse res       throws IOException, ServletException {       ServletContext context = getServletContext  ;       String pictureName =             context.getInitParameter “picture” ;       … } After this information is acquired, you can use additional context meth-  ods to read in the actual object. Here are a few for you to consider:      String path   throws java.net    URL getResource  .MalformedURLException This method returns a local or remote  resource to the specified path. The path is viewed as relative to the context  for the application and begins with a forward slash    . If a resource can- not be mapped to the specified path, the method returns a null.  InputStream getResourceAsStream String path  This method  creates an InputStream linked to a resource for the path parameter.  The path variable can consist of a resource of any type or length.   String getMimeType String file  This method returns a string  representation of the MIME type for the specified file.  RequestDispatcher getRequestDispatcher String path  This  method returns the RequestDispatcher object to the resource specified  by the path. It enables a current servlet to forward a request to the  resource or to include the resource in a response.  Continuing our picture example, we are going to read in the image file to  convert it to an ImageIcon object that we can use in an applet embedded  within the client interface:  … public void doGet HttpServletRequest req,                    HttpServletResponse res       throws IOException, ServletException {         ServletContext context = getServletContext  ;         String pictureName = context.getInitParameter “picture” ;         InputStream is = context.getResourceAsStream pictureName ;   126 Chapter 4  cid:2  The Servlet Container Model          byte[] array = new byte[1024];         is.read array ;         ImageIcon icon = new ImageIcon array ;         is.close  ; }  After we access the actual path of the picture parameter, we use the  getResourceAsStream method to return to us an InputStream to read  each pixel byte. To avoid a complex example, we’ve stipulated that the size  of the image is always 1,024 bytes. The bytes are read into a byte array, and  then that array is passed to the javax.swing.ImageIcon …  constructor to  create a graphical object that can be embedded in any swing component.  A more convoluted but practical process would encompass reading in all the  bytes without knowing the actual size beforehand. Our goal is to focus on  the usage and rules of the ServletContext object.   Aside from providing read-only access to initialization parameters, the   context also enables the servlet to read from and write to context attributes.  Unlike parameters, attributes allow the passing of Objects rather than just  Strings. Attributes are used to share common objects with various resources.  Specifically attributes are a way for the server to communicate information  to the servlet. The server could make available statistics on the server load,  or pass a handle to a shared resource pool, or provide other bits of informa- tion available at the server level. The only mandatory attribute a server must  make available is the location of a private directory for the application’s  context. This value can be accessed through the javax.servlet.context  .tempdir attribute. Needless to say, attributes can also be set by the user. Let’s say you are writing an application for a sushi restaurant called   Kazumis. The owner specifically asked that the interface display the current  lunch menu with the daily specials. Because these values are likely to  change depending on the date, you will set them up as attributes.  Before we show you the code, let’s address a few details. It’s important to  know that attributes can be defined within a web application by a servlet, or  within the servlet container when the application is assembled or deployed.  The names are usually defined by using the packaging structure to avoid  overriding one another  for example, java.*, javax.*, com.sun.*,  and so on .  Attributes are defined and stored by using getXXX and setXXX methods.  Unlike parameters, they are not defined within a deployment descriptor.    ServletContext 127  All servlets within the web application can access these values and set   them by using the following methods available in the ServletContext class:  void setAttribute String name, Object value  This method  binds the specified object to the name for access by all resources within the  web application.  Object getAttribute String name  This method returns the bound  object to the name specified.  In the earlier specifications, it was not unusual to develop a servlet   designed to prepare the context for all other resources. For example, instead  of defining the attribute name and value through the web container, you  could have a servlet take care of the task by using similar code to the  following:  … public void doGet HttpServletRequest req,                    HttpServletResponse res       throws ServletException, IOException {       res.setContentType “text plain” ;       PrintWriter out = res.getWriter  ;            ServletContext context = getServletContext  ;       context.setAttribute “com.kazumi.specials.daily”,            “Unagi:2 pieces for $2” ;       context.setAttribute “com.kazumi.date”, new Date   ;        out.println “The daily special is set” ; } … In this example, the attributes are applied to the context by using the  setAttribute …  method. Later, we will discuss the ServletContext  AttributeListener interface that was added in the 2.3 specification to  enable a class to respond to attribute changes made to a context. For now, let’s  focus on the rules and concept. A servlet uses the getAttribute   method to  retrieve the stored attribute values. For example, you can now construct the  part of the servlet that displays the menu with the defined daily special:  … public void doGet HttpServletRequest req,                   HttpServletResponse res     128 Chapter 4  cid:2  The Servlet Container Model      throws ServletException, IOException {        res.setContentType “text html” ;       PrintWriter out = res.getWriter  ;            ServletContext context = getServletContext  ;       String special =  String         context.getAttribute “com.kazumi.specials.daily” ;       Date date =  Date         context.getAttribute “com.kazumi.date” ;         DateFormat df =         DateFormat.getDateInstance DateFormat.MEDIUM ;       String now = df.format date ;       out.println " " ;       out.println " " ;       …       out.println "  The special for “ + now + “ is: “ +                    special + “ " ;       …        out.println “  ” ; } By using the ServletContext’s getAttribute …  method, you can  retrieve the object associated with the specified key name. The names  themselves are either custom or defined within the servlet specifications. In  Chapter 2, “The Servlet Model,” we listed several predefined attribute key  names created for request objects. These same names can be used to set  values that apply to the entire context. Table 4.1 lists the predefined attribute  names that are most likely used to set general messaging and exceptions for  a ServletContext object.  Standard Attribute Name  Type  javax.servlet.error.exception_type  java.lang.Class  javax.servlet.error.message  java.lang.String  javax.servlet.error.exception  java.lang.Throwable  T A B L E 4 . 1 Attributes for ServletContext   ServletContext 129  By using the setAttribute …  method, you can pass the standard   attribute name and its associated value. This enables developers to use a  standard naming system for exceptions that occur at the context level.   There are several important distinctions between context parameters and   attributes. The following are a few that you should be aware of:   cid:2  Parameters can be set only from within the container or the web.xml   file. Attributes, however, can be set by the servlet or the container.   cid:2  Parameters return only Strings, whereas attributes allow key names   to be associated with Objects.   cid:2  The lookup names used for attributes are either predefined or custom,  but they should be defined by using a package structure. For example,  the attribute name for error messages is javax.servlet.error .message.   In summary, the context utilizes parameters and attributes as a means  of sharing information and objects with the resources of the web applica- tion. Initialization parameters are defined in the deployment descriptor  and are accessible through the context. They provide configuration infor- mation in the form of String objects. Attributes, on the other hand, share  objects with the application entities. Their name value pairs can be set  through the container or through the servlet using the context. They are  less geared to providing information, and are more geared to providing  resources.   Listener Interfaces and Event Classes  New to the 2.3 servlet specification are listener classes that help monitor the  servlet context and session life cycle. The web container can be configured  to notify listeners when a context is initialized or destroyed, when attributes  are added or removed, or when a session is set to be passivated or activated.  In this section, you will look at each listener interface and see when and how  these listeners are used.  ServletContextListener  During the life of a web application, many resources are created and uti- lized by various entities such as servlets. When an application is created,  it might be desirable to ensure that all servlets are provided a particular    130 Chapter 4  cid:2  The Servlet Container Model  resource  for example, a database connection . When the application is  destroyed, those resources might need to be removed as well. The addition  of the ServletContextListener interface is designed to accomplish  such tasks.   A class that implements the ServletContextListener interface must   define two methods:  void contextInitialized ServletContextEvent e  This method  is called when the context is created. You are guaranteed that this  method will complete before any requests are serviced.   void contextDestroyed ServletContextEvent e  This method is  called when the context is about to be destroyed. This method acts like a  finalize method. It is used to clean up resources.  The most common example used to demonstrate the effectiveness of a  ServletContextListener is the creation and removal of a single connec- tion or a connection pool. A connection pool creates a defined number of  connections to a database. Instead of allowing each client a continuous con- nection, the connections are borrowed from the pool when they are needed  and returned after a task is completed. By checking connections in and out,  the server can provide more clients database connectivity while utilizing  fewer connections. The end result is a more efficient application. To create  such an environment, the connections, or the pool, must be created before a  request to a servlet can be processed. This can be done with a listener, as  shown in Listing 4.1.   Listing 4.1: Using the ServletContextListener  package com.spiderInc; import java.sql.*; import javax.sql.*; import javax.naming.*; import javax.servlet.*;  public class ConnectionPoolHandler        implements ServletContextListener {     public void contextInitialized ServletContext sce  {     ServletContext context = e.getServletContext  ;     String dbName =context.getInitParameter “Database” ;       ServletContext 131      try {        InitialContext ic = new InitialContext  ;         PooledConnection con =  PooledConnection            ic.lookup "java:comp env jdbc ” + dbName ;     } catch  Exception e  {}      context.setAttribute “con”, con ;  }   public void contextDestroyed ServletContext sce  {             ServletContext context = e.getServletContext  ;        PooledConnection con =            PoolConnection context.getAttribute “con” ;         try { con.close  ; } catch  Exception e  {}  }  } When the web application begins, the contextInitialized …    method is invoked and must complete before any requests can be for- warded to a servlet. It is the perfect place to initialize any variables that will  be shared by other resources. Before this particular web application can  begin, you must first create a connection pool to a particular database.  To allow for database flexibility  meaning you can change the database with- out recompiling the application code , you define the actual database name in  the container as a parameter. By using the getInitParameter  “Database”   method, you retrieve the database name to then look up its associated pool  using the Java Naming and Directory Interface  JNDI . The exam does not  test you on lookup techniques or JNDI, so we won’t go into it in detail.  Basically, you access a connection pool defined within the container by  using the lookup …  method. After you acquire a connection pool, you set  that object as an attribute for all servlets to access.   When the web application is shut down, the contextDestroyed …    method will be called. The preceding example uses the context to get the object  associated with the attribute name con. The bound PooledConnection  object is returned and then closed.   132 Chapter 4  cid:2  The Servlet Container Model  Here is a code snippet showing how a servlet could use the attributes to   accomplish database tasks:  public class QueryServlet extends HttpServlet {     public void doGet HttpRequestServlet req,                       HttpResponseServlet res        throws IOException, ServletException {        …        SerlvetContext context = getServletContext  ;        PooledConnection con =            PooledConnection context.getAttribute “con” ;        Connection connection = con.getConnection  ;        Statement stmt = connection.createStatement  ;        …     } } The QueryServlet uses the context to get the attribute value for con.  After a handle to the connection pool is returned, a connection is checked  out from the pool. A statement is created, and then a query can be sent to the  database. From this example, you can see that the ServletContextListener  serves its purpose in initializing all necessary data before a servlet request  is invoked.   In addition to understanding how a context is initialized, it is also  important to understand when a context is likely to be initialized and  removed. The most obvious time a context is created or destroyed is when  the container first starts up the application or closes it down. However,  during the container’s life, a web application can be stopped and reloaded  if necessary. For example, you might need to switch the application to a  backup database for maintenance purposes. Changes would be made to  point the application to the right database, and the container should pro- vide mechanisms to reload the application dynamically. Your listener  would get the new ServletContext and change the connection informa- tion by reinitializing the database connection through the defined initial- ization parameters.  We’ve discussed how to create a listener and when it will be invoked,  but the final piece is linking the listener to the container. The container  is made aware of a listener through the deployment descriptor. By using  the listener tags, you identify which listeners are associated with the  application. Continuing with our example, let’s take a look at how the    ServletContext 133  ConnectionPoolHandler is defined within the web.xml file:                  com.spiderInc.ConnectionPoolHandler         When the web.xml file is read, the server creates an instance of the lis-  tener class. By using introspection, it determines what listener interface  the class implements and registers it accordingly. The order in which event  classes are listed defines the order they will be invoked. The servlet 2.3 speci- fication mandates that the container complete instantiations of the listener  classes in the application prior to executing the first request for the appli- cation. As a result, these tags should appear before the servlets are declared  in the DTD file.  All event listener classes use the same listener tag.   There is no need to make a method call such as addXXXListener. By   using reflection, the server handles the registration between it and the  listener.   It is mandatory that the web container create an instance of all listener classes  and register them for event notification before the first request for the appli- cation is processed. Also, the container must maintain a handle to the listener  until the last request is made for the application.  ServletContextEvent  When the container creates or destroys a context, it generates  a ServletContextEvent object that contains a reference to the actual  ServletContext. An event is simply an object that holds data about  an activity that took place. Usually, it has only get methods to access  information about the object. For the ServletContextEvent class, the  following method is available:  ServletContext getServletContext   This method returns a  handle to the application’s ServletContext.   134 Chapter 4  cid:2  The Servlet Container Model  The ServletContextListener is notified when a change is made to the  context for the web application. In order for the listener to respond, it most  likely needs access to the actual context.   ServletContextAttributeListener  The attributes of a context are shared by all servlets in the web application.  After a servlet gets an attribute, it is quite likely that another servlet will  change the value of that attribute by calling setAttribute … . To ensure  application-wide consistency, receiving notification of any changes to the  attributes would be beneficial. The  ServletContextAttributeListener  provides the solution. An implementing class must define the following  methods:  void attributeAdded ServletContextAttributeEvent e  This  method is called when an attribute is added to the context.  void attributeRemoved SelectContextAttributeEvent e  This  method is called when an attribute is removed from the context.  void attributeReplaced ServletContextAttributeEvent e  This method is called when an existing attribute value is changed.  The specific method of a ServletContextAttributeListener will be  called depending on the attribute action. The server locates this listener  through the deployment descriptor. Similar to the ServletContextListener,  the class name must be defined by using the listener tags. By using  reflection, the server will determine the implementing interface and know  to call this class when attribute values are changed.  When a change occurs to an attribute, the listener might want to   know which attribute was changed and then respond. For example, a  servlet might change the context database attribute. The ServletContext  AttributeListener’s attributeReplaced …  method would be called.  The listener could then disconnect from the old database, get the new value,  and reconnect to the new database.   ServletContextAttributeEvent  The ServletContextAttributeEvent class extends the ServletContextEvent  class and adds two methods to acquire the name and value of the attribute.    HttpSession  HttpSession 135  In addition to the getServletContext   method, the following methods  are available:  String getName   This method returns the name of the attribute  being created, replaced, or removed.  Object getValue   This method returns the object of the attribute  being created, replaced, or removed.  While the context provides servlets access to the container’s data, a   session provides servlets access to the actions of each user utilizing the site.  An application is made up of many pieces. A significant piece is a session  object. An HttpSession object is created when a user sends its first request  to an application. The object is maintained on the server end and can be  configured to track each action the user takes while at the site. Remember,  with HTTP, each request response transaction creates a new object. The  session connection is separate. After a session connection is established, it  exists until a user is idle for a specified time period. This period is defined  within either the deployment descriptor or the server. During the life of the  session, the user is likely to make multiple requests while transferring infor- mation to the server. The user information can be stored in the session to  eliminate the need to resend the information to the server.   A shopping cart provides the perfect example of how sessions work.   Imagine that a client accesses a site that enables registered users to purchase  music CDs. From the time the user logs in to the time they place their order  and check out, a session exists and stores the data of the entire transaction.  The following example walks you through the process. Figure 4.1 shows  how the first request, a login, causes the container to create an HttpSession  for that user with the information sent by the client.  F I G U R E 4 . 1 The creation of a session object  login: password:  Session object  login: Delon password: bro7h3r  Client  Application   136 Chapter 4  cid:2  The Servlet Container Model  The session is created and is written to store the information sent by   the client request. As the session continues to persist with each additional  request, the user begins to shop. If the user finds a CD of choice, they can  add it to their cart. This information can then be stored in the session object  for checkout purposes. Figure 4.2 shows how the session object tracks the  transactions the user makes.  F I G U R E 4 . 2 Creating session data  Cart  Session object  login: Delon password: bro7h3r item: CD title: Invisible Band cost: $15.00 cc: 55555555555  F I G U R E 4 . 3 Using session data  Client  Application  After the user is ready to check out, they send a request to the application.  The application can use the information stored by the session to verify the  order before finalizing the transaction. Figure 4.3 shows how the session  data is used to communicate the order to the client.  Delon,  Would you like to purchase:  item: CD title: Invisible Band cost: $15 Yes  No  Session object  login: Delon …  Database  Client  Application  The session information is used to verify the order before the information  is written to a database. When the user is finished, all necessary data can be  written to the appropriate storage locations and the session is removed.   The HttpSession object does not automatically track user actions. Cap-  turing and storing the information is the responsibility of the developer.    HttpSession 137  When a servlet receives a request, it can use the HttpServletRequest class  to access the current session or create a new one:   HttpSession getSession boolean value  This method gets the  current session for the request user. A true parameter creates a new  session object if one does not already exist.  After a servlet has a handle to the session object, it can use the methods   within the HttpSession class to manipulate the session’s data. Some of  those methods are as follows:  Object getAttribute String name  This method returns the object  associated with the specified name. For example, a session can hold  objects, such as a bean, for the user.   void setAttribute String name, Object value  This binds an  attribute object to a key name.  void removeAttribute String name  This removes the bound object  and name from the session based on the specified name.   To make servlets more robust and flexible, listener interfaces have been  added to the session object. These interfaces enable servlets to monitor and  respond to the creation or removal of a session, or to a change in its  attributes. Next, we will take a close look at the various session listener  classes, their uses, and benefits.   HttpSessionListeners are notified when a session is created or destroyed.  Let’s say you have a brokerage application that closely monitors the user’s  every action to validate the purchase or sale of stocks. To prevent any cus- tomer disputes, the brokerage writes each action to a hard disk while the  customer is logged in. As soon as a session becomes active, you want to make  a new and unique file for that customer. Your listener could perform the  necessary steps when it receives notification that a new session has been  added to the server. These are the methods that an implementing class must  define:  void sessionCreated HttpSessionEvent e  This method is called  when a session is created.  void sessionDestroyed HttpSessionEvent e  This method is  called to identify that a session has been invalidated.  HttpSessionListener   138 Chapter 4  cid:2  The Servlet Container Model  The following is a code example of the scenario we have just discussed:  public class HttpSessionHandler                   implements HttpSessionListener {     public void sessionCreated HttpSessionEvent e  {       HttpSession session = e.getSession  ;       File file= new File session.getId   ;       session.setAttribute “trackingFile”, file ;     }     public void       File sess.getAttributeDestroyed HttpSessionEvent e  {        HttpSession sess = e.getSession  ;       File file =          File sess.getAttribute “trackingFile” ;       ServletContext context = sess.getServletContext  ;       Connection con =         Connection context.getAttribute “dbConnection” ;           use connection to write file to database       file.delete  ;     } }  In the previous code example, it’s important to note that we use the   session.getId   method to create a file object. This approach guarantees  the creation of a unique file for each session based on the session name.  Basically, no two sessions can overwrite each other. The servlet can use the  HttpServletRequest object to get the session and access the file. A descrip- tion of the request can then be logged to the file for future documentation.  See the following sample code:  public class BuyStockServlet extends HttpServlet {     public void doGet HttpServletRequest req,                       HttpServletResponse res        throws IOException, ServletException {         HttpSession sess = req.getSession  ;         File temp =              File sess.getAttribute “trackingFile” ;         FileWriter fw = new FileWriter temp ;         Enumeration enum = req.getParameterNames  ;         while enum.hasMoreElements    {             fw.write req.getMethod   ;   HttpSession 139              String name =  String enum.nextElement  ;             String[] values =               req.getParameterValues name ;             for int k=0; k<values.length; k++  {                 fw.write values[k] ;             }         }     } } After the servlet accesses the session object, it can get the file attribute.  It wraps the File object in a FileWriter and filters through the request  data to then write it to the file. When the session is invalidated, the  HttpSessionListener is notified and the sessionDestroyed …  method  is called to then write the file to a database.  HttpSessionEvent  When a session is created or destroyed, an HttpSessionEvent object is  instantiated to store a handle to the actual session:   HttpSession getSession   This method returns the HttpSession  object.  Because multiple clients can access a site at one time, the listener will be  called each time a new session is created. The getSession   method returns  the session for the session object created or destroyed.  HttpSessionAttributeListener  In an effort to monitor the client’s actions, you can utilize the  HttpSessionAttributeListener interface to receive notification  when a client session’s attributes are changed. This enables you to write  code that automatically generates a response to changes in their informa- tion or wants. By defining the following methods, the implementing  HttpSessionAttributeListener class is notified when an attribute is  added, removed, or placed:  void attributeAdded HttpSessionBindingEvent e  This method  is called after an attribute is added to a session.   140 Chapter 4  cid:2  The Servlet Container Model  void attributeRemoved HttpSessionBindingEvent e  This  method is called after an attribute is removed from a session.  void attributeReplaced HttpSessionBindingEvent e  This  method is called after an attribute is replaced within a session.  The attributes represent the data or model of a session object. When a ses- sion’s data is changed, another response or reaction might be appropriate.  For example, imagine a web application that provides the user with a ticker  tape listing the stocks of the NASDAQ stock exchange. When a user logs  into this site, a session is created. They then have the option to select a  particular ticker for more detailed information on that stock. By selecting  a stock, they are actually adding themselves to an alias list that is notified when  changes to the stock occur. Let’s say a user clicks on the symbol XLNX.  This action causes a stock object with that symbol to be added to their  session ID. The addition of a stock object attribute can trigger the creation of  an HttpSessionBindingEvent and a call to the attributeAdded …  or  attributeReplaced …  method of the HttpSessionAttributeListener.  These methods could then access the session ID and get the user’s name  and e-mail address to then add them to a notification list for up-to-date  information about changes to the stocks defined within their stock object.  The process might occur in the following fashion:  1. The user begins by selecting XLNX from the listed ticker:  1. SUNW 20.4   ORCL 32.5  IBM 59.7  XLNX 35.4  QCOM 60.7  2. The symbol is added to the client’s Session Object:  Session Object UserName = Joe UserEmail = Joe@eei.com Stock = stockList    This is a List object that contains     all selected stocks.                      In this case, it contains XLNX.  3. The HttpSessionAttributeListener is notified:  public class HttpSessionAttributeHandler                implements HttpSessionAttributeListener{   public void attributeAdded HttpSessionBindingEvent e  {     HttpSession session = e.getSession  ;     String email=        String session.getAttribute “UserEmail” ;   HttpSession 141      ArrayList stockList =  ArrayList e.getValue  ;     Iterator iter = stockList.iterator  ;     while iter.hasNext    {         String symbol =  String iter.next  ;         ServletContext context                 = session.getServletContext  ;         Connection con =  Connection                 context.getAttribute “Connection” ;            Write email address and symbol to database             if they don’t already exist.     }   }   public void attributeRemoved HttpSessionBindingEvent e          {}   public void attributeReplaced HttpSessionBindingEvent e         {} }  The user selects the symbol XLNX, which creates a Stock attribute   whose value is a cumulative list of all symbols selected during the session.  Assuming this is the first symbol selected, the addition of a new attribute  prompts the server to notify the HttpSessionAttributeListener by calling  its attributeAdded …  method. By using the HttpSessionBindingEvent  object, we are able to get the value of the new attribute and use the connec- tion acquired from the context to then write the e-mail address and symbol  to a database. Another servlet can query the database when information  about the symbol changes to e-mail interested parties about latest news.  In general, this listener acts as a mediator to respond to session attribute  changes.  It is important to remember that a session can continue to exist after a trans- action is complete. The user might still want to start a new transaction. When  this happens, attributes can be replaced, removed, and then added again.  Attribute changes to a ServletContext or an HttpSession object can  occur concurrently. Because containers are not required to synchronize the  listener notifications, it is possible to have one notification corrupt the data  of another. Consequently, the developer must maintain the integrity of the  attribute values when coding the listener classes.    142 Chapter 4  cid:2  The Servlet Container Model  HttpSessionBindingEvent  HttpSessionActivationListener  When an action takes place with respect to a session’s attributes, an  HttpSessionBindingEvent object is created. The HttpSessionBindingEvent  class extends the HttpSessionEvent class and adds methods to access  attribute information. This object stores a handle to the session, the attribute  name, and attribute value. The methods are as follows:   HttpSession getSession   This method returns a handle to the  session object.  String getName   This method returns the name bound or unbound  to the session.  Object getValue   This method returns the value that has been  added, removed, replaced, not bound, or unbound from the session.   The event is either passed to an HttpSessionAttributeListener or   HttpSessionBindingListener.  The HttpSessionActivationListener is used to maintain sessions that  migrate from one server to another. When a session is about to be moved to  a new server, it is passivated, or made inactive. After the session is on the new  server, it is brought back to life and activated. The implementing interface is  notified during both these events. This provides an opportunity to save or  store data across Java Virtual Machines  JVMs . A listener must implement  the following methods:  void sessionDidActivate HttpSessionEvent se  This method is  called right after the session is activated. At this point, the session is not  yet in service.   void sessionWillPassivate HttpSessionEvent se  This method  is called when a session is about to be passivated. At this point, the  session is no longer in service.  Let’s say you have a web application that stores customer transaction infor- mation to a file. Due to the success of the application, the developers designed  a distributed environment by pooling multiple computers together to efficiently  handle resource usage. When one server is bombarded with hits, sessions are  moved to a new server, where more resources might be available. Now, if a  session is moved to a new server with a new JVM, the file that was originally  written to is no longer available. An HttpSessionActivationListener  ensures the data integrity of a session. When the session is about to be    HttpSession 143  passivated, sessionWillPassivate …  is called. This method could be used  to read the contents of the file into the session object. When the session is trans- ferred over, sessionDidActivate …  is called. This method could be used to  read the content from the session and write it to a file on the new server. Here  is a code sample illustrating this example:  public class HttpSessionActivationHandler   implements HttpSessionActivationListener{     public void sessionDidActivate HttpSessionEvent e {       HttpSession ses = e.getSession  ;       try {         File f =  File ses.getAttribute “file” ;         byte[] fileByteArray = new byte[ int f.length  ];         FileInputStream fr = new FileInputStream f ;         fr.read fileByteArray ;         ses.setAttribute “file”, fileByteArray ;         fr.close  ;       } catch  IOException ignore  {}     } }     public void sessionWillPassivate HttpSessionEvent e {       HttpSession ses = e.getSession  ;       try {               byte[] byteFile =  byte[] ses.getAttribute “file” ;         FileOutputStream fs =            new FileOutputStream “NewFile.txt” ;         fs.write byteFile ;         fs.close  ;          sess.setAttribute “file”, new File “data.txt”  ;       } catch IOException ignore  {}     } } An HttpSessionActivationListener is registered in the deployment  descriptor by using the listener tag. The process is almost exactly the same  as with other listeners. To enable the session to transfer to another server,  all target servers must mirror the original server. The listener must be  defined in the web.xml file for all possible servers. Remember, the activa- tion method and passivation methods will probably be called on different  systems.    144 Chapter 4  cid:2  The Servlet Container Model  HttpSessionBindingListener  When a session attribute is added, removed, or replaced, the HttpSession  AttributeListener is notified. The HttpSessionBindingListener is very sim- ilar in that it is notified when an object is bound or unbound to a session. The  difference between the two listeners is based on whether you would like to  handle the event change from the session’s perspective or from the object’s  perspective:   cid:2  The HttpSessionAttributeListener looks at all objects added to   the session. It manages all attribute changes for the session.    cid:2  The HttpSessionBindingListener lets the object know when it is   bound  added  or unbound  removed  from the session so it can  directly respond to the event.  When a session times out or is invalidated, objects are unbound from the  session. HttpSessionBindingListener is notified and HttpSessionAttribute  Listener is not.   The implementing class must define the following methods:  void valueBound HttpSessionBindingEvent event  This method  identifies the session and notifies the object that it is being bound to  a session.  void valueUnbound HttpSessionBindingEvent event  This  method identifies the session and notifies the object that it is being  unbound from a session.  A mail application could greatly benefit from this listener because it could   disconnect from the mail server when the session was invalidated.  In general, event listener classes are used to respond to changes made to the  servlet context and HTTP sessions. They are instantiated and registered in  the web container when the application is being deployed. An application can  have multiple listeners for each event type and the order of invocation can be  specified within the container. When the application is shut down, the con- tainer will first invalidate a session and invoke session listeners and then  invoke context listeners to close the application.    Distributable Environment 145  EEI’s Mail Application  In an attempt to offer employees the ability to check their company e-mail  while off site, Educational Edge, Inc.  EEI  created a web mail application.  Soon after the program was released, however, a problem began to occur:  the technical department was consistently notified that users were having  problems logging back into the system after their sessions timed out.  Apparently, employees were logging into the application and then letting it  sit idly until their session was invalidated. The application was not designed  to close the connection on a timeout, and unfortunately the destruction of  the session did not automatically close network connections. If a user tried  to log back into the application, they were unable to establish a connection  because the old one was not yet closed. To ensure the integrity of users’  mail, most mail applications do not allow users to have multiple sessions  alive. Consequently, the connection had to be manually closed within the  application code.  The developers worked on a new version that created an HttpSession  BindingListener object. In the valueUnbound …  method, the connection  was closed and the problem resolved. It is also important to note that the  HttpSessionBindingListener is usually implemented in one of the main  servlet classes, and not in a class written specifically as a listener. In this  manner, the mail servlet class would know when it was bound or unbound  to the session and could respond accordingly. In general, this listener is  most effective when resources need to be cleaned up or established as a  result of objects being bound and unbound from a session.  Distributable Environment  A distributable environment, also known as clustering, utilizes multi-  ple back-end servers to distribute processing responsibilities. This technique  promotes efficiency and dependability. With multiple servers to handle  requests, the application can manage a large number of simultaneous requests    146 Chapter 4  cid:2  The Servlet Container Model  on different systems. When one machines crashes, requests can be redirected  to another server to keep the application alive.  The benefits seem to warrant that all systems be configured to run in   a distributed environment. This, however, is not the case. Designing a  robust system is more complicated than creating an application that runs on  one system. In addition, more systems are costly. The hardware and software  prices for the servers increase the cost of the application almost twofold for  each additional layer or cluster. The question is whether the cost is worth the  performance benefits. Unfortunately, the performance benefits are enjoyed  only under extreme loads. If the application doesn’t receive a lot of hits and  the current system can handle the requests, there is no need to forward or  transfer loads to different resources. Now, if the system has high visibility  and is accessed heavily, the cost is negligible compared to the benefits gained  from a dependable system. Imagine the profits lost from a system that is not  accessible. Also, the speed of processing could bring in larger profits that  would pay for the costs of a robust system and then some.  If you choose to create a distributed system, you should keep some design  considerations in mind. The application is no longer run on one JVM; there  is no longer one servlet context or one servlet instance. As a result, some rules  must be considered when developing the application:  First, variables must be handled differently. In fact, instance and static  variables should be avoided. Imagine a servlet that stores a counter to  measure how many times it is accessed during its lifetime. If the counter is an  instance or static variable, the following applies:  Instance variable The variable will measure only the number of times  that specific instance is accessed. Each servlet will generate a different  value.  Static variable The variable is shared among all instances—within the  same JVM. In a distributed environment, the static variable cannot be  accessed by another JVM.   Keep in mind that the server might create multiple instances of a servlet for  pooling, threading, or reloading purposes.   To prevent problems, the variable could be stored to an external resource,   such as a database, and accessed by each servlet instance to update and  access the value. If the variable applies to the session, it can be set as an  attribute rather than a variable.   Distributable Environment 147  Second, the ServletContext should not store state. Remember, a   context provides the servlet access to the server and container information.  Multiple JVMs mean there are multiple contexts, and their data will differ  depending on location. When a session is transferred to another server as a  part of resource management, the servlet context is left behind and a new  context is created. Again, the data you would consider storing in a context  should also be placed in an external resource such as a database.  Third, HttpSession objects must also be handled with distribution in  mind. Because a session might be migrated between different systems, all  associated objects must be transferable. For example, an object that imple- ments java.io.Serializable makes it portable. If an object contains data  that cannot be transferred, for example, Thread objects, the session will not  be activated in its correct form when it attempts to come alive on the new  server.   Fourth, files should also be handled differently. In a distributed environ- ment, you are not guaranteed the location of the servlet. Consequently, it  is preferable and more reliable to access files by using a path relative to  the context, rather than the server. The encouraged approach is through the  getResource …  method of the ServletContext: getServletContext   .getResource String path . Because the file is packaged with the appli- cation, it is accessible from the same location  the relative path to the  application’s context directory  regardless of the server.  Finally, threading must be considered. Synchronization is a locking mech- anism used to ensure that data cannot be accessed by multiple requests. The  only problem is that synchronization applies to only one JVM. Synchroni- zation cannot be guaranteed in a distributed environment.  Developing an application to run in a distributable environment requires  careful consideration on how to handle attributes and path information.  Writing code that deals with such issues is the first step in enabling your  application to run between multiple systems. The second step is to modify  the web.xml file to include a tag indicating that the application is suited for  such an environment.   Marking the deployment descriptor enables the server to deploy the   application across multiple back ends. This is done by placing an empty    tag between the application’s description and context  parameters.  Deployment Descriptor    148 Chapter 4  cid:2  The Servlet Container Model  Without this empty tag, the application is non-distributable by default.  The addition of the tag indicates the possibility for the application to be split.                      …         …   Marking an application distributable does not guarantee that the appli- cation will be split between multiple systems. It indicates only that the  application is capable of being split between multiple machines.   At this point, we’ve discussed how to write an application that can run on  more than one server and how to modify the DTD to notify the server of the  potential environmental behaviors. Now you’re ready to look at the different  kinds of container types available to manage distributed applications.  There are four types of container support. It’s important to understand  the different types in order to know what behaviors to expect. A complex  application that performs multiple operations and is likely to receive many  concurrent hits might require a more robust server, whereas a simple  application that displays sport statistics might require only a simple server.  The type of container selected is heavily dependent on the amount of  thread-safety you are looking to obtain. Table 4.2 displays the functionality  options.     Clustering  Session Migration  Session Failover  Type 1  Type 2  Type 3  Type 4     X  X  X        X  X           X  Distributed Containers  T A B L E 4 . 2 Container Support    Distributable Environment 149  Each container has its own set of distinctive features, which in turn  produces variation in each session. The following list describes the four  containers in greater detail:  Type 1 This container does not support clustering and is usually a stand- alone application that ignores all distributed information. The stand-alone  Tomcat server falls in this category.  Type 2 Non-session requests are randomly distributed, whereas  session-related requests are tied to their originating server. The session  is tied to a particular host. Because sessions are not transferred, they can  contain data that is nontransferable. The disadvantages of this container  are as follows:  Sessions cannot to be migrated to an underutilized server.  A crash will also result in a broken session.  Type 3 In addition to the features defined in the type 2 containers,  a type 3 enables sessions to be migrated to underutilized servers to  improve load balancing. The specification guarantees that the session  will migrate only between requests. This feature prevents concurrency  issues. Because session migration is a feature, the session’s data must be  transferable.  Type 4 This container builds on type 3 and adds the capability to dupli- cate the contents of a session. When an individual component crashes, the  user’s session is not necessarily destroyed because the data can be saved  and transferred.   Generally ServletContext and HttpSession are associated with the  JVM servicing the session requests. Because distributed containers are not  required to propagate either object to another JVM, you cannot rely on  this functionality if the container simply states, it is compliant with the  2.3 specification.   The final important note is to understand how listener classes are   handled in a distributed environment. Basically, there is one listener class  instance per listener class defined in the deployment descriptor per JVM.  If a session is transferred to another server, the application in the new  environment should contain a separate listener instance to handle session  events.                                         150  Chapter 4  cid:1   The Servlet Container Model  Filters  I  n photography, a single image can be changed greatly by the filter used   to capture the picture. One filter might soften edges, while another might  enhance the color contrast by hardening edges. Another might add the date  and author signature to the photo. These alterations do not change the fun- damental image; instead, they provide subtle enhancements. A filter is often  a thin layer of some sort that provides subtle changes to a particular object.  In this example, the object is a picture.  In the Java world, a filter can be applied to one or more servlets JSPs or  application files. Imagine that a client selects an image in JPEG format and  sends it to a servlet to modify. If the servlet can handle only TIF files, a filter  can be used to handle the conversion before the servlet even accesses the  image. Another example of filter use is to compress the response output  stream to improve bandwidth utilization. The filter could use the request  headers to check whether the client  browser  supports compression, and if  so, wrap the response object with a custom writer or output stream object  that handles compression. The stream would then eliminate unnecessary bits  and transfer content at a faster rate. Filters can be used to encrypt or decrypt  data, to log and audit activity, and to trigger events. The options are endless.  Filters are covered in the exam. Currently, the topic is not listed as an exam  objective, but you can expect to find a few questions about this subject matter.  Consequently, in this section, we will discuss how a filter fits into the servlet life  cycle and all the elements necessary to create a functional and effective filter.  The Life Cycle  filter   is an object that can transform a request or modify a response. It   A  can preprocess a request before it reaches a servlet and it can postprocess a  response after it leaves a servlet.

Besides examining the request, the filter can modify                                                                                                 Filters  151  either the request headers or the request data by customizing the request. It  does this by wrapping its own request object around the original request.  After the filter completes its task, it then forwards the newly customized  request to the servlet.  The servlet will then perform its tasks and potentially generate a response.  In such a case, the response can be caught by the same or different filter. After  the filter intercepts the response, it can modify the response headers or response  data by again wrapping a filter response object around the original response  to create a customized object. This customized object is then sent to the client.  When a filter intercepts a response object, is cannot alter the output stream  information if the output stream was closed by the servlet. As a result, you are  encouraged to have a servlet    a stream rather than   close    flush     it.  In simple terms, the process is as follows:  A client sends a request.  The filter intercepts the client’s request.  The filter examines and can modify the request headers and request  data by using its own custom request to wrap around the intercepted  request object.  The filter propagates the request to the servlet.  The servlet generates a response and flushes it.  The filter intercepts the response.  The filter can modify the response headers and response data by using its  own custom response to wrap around the intercepted response object.  8.  Once complete, the filter sends the newly filtered response to the client.  Filters are quite easy to create. The difficulty lies in the logic used to manip- ulate the content. To create a filter, you must follow three simple steps. The  filter class must:  Implement the appropriate interface  Define its methods  Be declared within the deployment descriptor   1.  2.  3.  4.  5.  6.  7.  1.  2.  3.

It links the filter to a URL  pattern. This enables the developer to apply the filter to a group of servlets,  JSPs, or any static content. Using the url-pattern tag, you can identify the  files or types of files to which the filter is to be applied. The following code  uses the filter example we discussed to append the copyright statement to all  pages that end with .jsp:         copyrightFilter        *.jsp       There is an order to which the container processes filter-mapping tags.   Filters using the url-pattern tags are processed first, in the order they  appear in the deployment descriptor; then the servlet-name tag filters are  run—again, in the order they appear in the deployment descriptor.  The filter and filter-mapping tags must be defined before any servlet tags.  Listener tags are defined in this same region.  Summary  This chapter focused on features that are associated with or handled   by the container. We began by explaining the purpose of a ServletContext  object and how it links the application to the container. By using the object’s  initialization parameters, the application components can acquire config- uration information from the container. Another feature of the context  is its capability to store attribute values. These values are set either in the    156 Chapter 4  cid:1  The Servlet Container Model  container or, the servlet code. Attributes enable objects to be bound to the  context. We then discussed the two listener interfaces used to receive  notifications of changes to the context: the ServletContextListener,  which is notified when the context is created or destroyed, and the  ServletContextAttributeListener, which is notified when an attribute  is added, removed, or replaced.  The next major topic was HttpSessions. Sessions hold transaction data  that is captured while a client accesses the application for a period of time.  Attributes are used to get and set information into the session object that is  stored on the server end. By using session objects, the application can reduce  the need to cache long-term data or have clients repeat data transmissions.  Four listeners exist for session objects: The HttpSessionListener is noti- fied when a session is created or destroyed. Like the context, there exists  an HttpSessionAttributeListener that is notified when attributes are  added, removed, or replaced. The HttpSessonActivationListener is used  for notification when a session is being moved between systems. It receives  an HttpSessionEvent when the session is activated or passivated. The final  listener is the HttpSessionBindingListener, which notifies a specific  object when it is being bound or unbound to the session. It passes an  HttpSessionBindingEvent that provides methods for access to the session  handle, and the name or value for the attribute being bound to or unbound  from the session.  The chapter concluded by discussing necessary considerations for an   application that exists within a distributable environment. We pointed out  how some containers offer this flexibility and some do not. If the application  can be distributed, a few concepts should be incorporated into the servlet  code. The context should avoid maintaining state because a new context is  associated with a session if the session is moved to a new system. When a ses- sion is moved, only listeners on the system where the session resides will be  notified of changes. Attributes or external resources are usually better ways  to store object data.   As for the deployment descriptor, all listeners are defined by using the   listener tag and the listener-class tags. The container uses reflection  to determine which listener the class actually implements. The order in  which the listeners are defined is the order they will be invoked, unless the  application is closing. In that case, the session listeners are called first, and  then the context.

Finally, a context  is not loaded; it is created.   2. D.  When declaring a filter in the deployment descriptor, you must  identify which resources the container must associate with the filter.  The url-pattern has no limitations, and in fact, the filter can be  called before any static file.

There isn’t much that can be done after the session is dis- abled, so no listener is notified in that circumstance.  12. A.  All listeners are defined by using the listener tag in the deployment  descriptor. The server uses reflection to determine which listener to  apply the class toward. As for HttpSessionActionListeners, the  implementing class must be defined in all servers that have access to  the server. The listener class is defined with the tag listener-class,  not listener-name.  13. C.  The server interrogates the class defined within the listener tag   and uses reflection to determine the listener interface that the class uti- lizes. The server, not the servlet, handles the association between the  listener and server.  14. C.  When a session is invalidated through a timeout, the HttpSession BindingListener for that object is notified to identify the object is  being removed or unbound from the session.  15. B.  Compliant containers are not required to handle distributable  applications. Consequently, it is not mandatory that containers for- ward context or session events to other JVMs.                                                            Chapter  Handling Exceptions  5  THE FOLLOWING SUN CERTIFIED WEB  COMPONENT DEVELOPER FOR J2EE  PLATFORM EXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED  IN THIS CHAPTER:   cid:1   4.1 For each of the following cases, identify correctly  constructed code for handling business logic exceptions, and  match that code with correct statements about the code’s  behavior:   Return an HTTP error using the  Return an HTTP error using the   sendError  setStatus   response method  method   cid:1   4.2 Given a set of business logic exceptions, identify the  following:  The configuration that the deployment descriptor uses to  handle each exception How to use a  to an error page Specify the handling declaratively in the deployment  descriptor   to forward the request   RequestDispatcher   cid:1   4.3 Identify the method used for the following:  Write a message to the WebApp log Write a message and an exception to the WebApp log   cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2                                    I   cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2   N  n an ideal world, all applications could run without encountering  problems. In reality, however, applications have little control over user input  or environmental effects. Consequently, all programs, especially those that  are networked, can falter. With this in mind, developers must take a proac- tive approach toward error handling when developing code. The code must  anticipate potential problems, notify the client, log the issue, limit damage,  and offer recovery alternatives. In this chapter, we will discuss the various  ways to handle common application errors. They include:   How to notify the client of errors or status changes  How to use and create error pages  How to log messages  How to define servlet exceptions   o matter how well an application is written, problems will always  occur.

Under  such circumstances,   provide a way to resolve, log, and commu- nicate the problem.   exceptions  When a problem occurs within a servlet, the developer must decide how  the application should proceed. Should it return an error and continue? Or  should it return an error page and stop the execution of the application? If  an error page is returned, who will develop it—the server or the application?  How will the application locate a custom error page? These are the questions  a developer must answer and consider when writing efficient servlets.  Problem Notification                           Problem Notification  169  In this section, we will cover the methods and procedures necessary to set  error codes and return error pages. But before we discuss the more advanced  methods of error handling, let’s look at the basic approach. Imagine a site  that requires the user to select an item from a list. Each element in the list rep- resents a separate file that exists elsewhere. If that file cannot be located, we  might have a problem. Listing 5.1 provides HTML code for a form contain- ing such a list. The image that follows is the HTML output generated from  the code.   Listing 5.1: index.html                          Select the desired inventory list:                                                Shampoo List                                 Conditioner List                                 Products List                                  <INPUT TYPE='submit' VALUE='GO!'                          NAME='button'>                            After the user selects an item, the form triggers a request to the   InventoryServlet selected item. Listing 5.2 displays the servlet’s code.    and attempts to retrieve the file associated to the                                      170  Chapter 5  cid:2   Handling Exceptions  Listing 5.2: InventoryServlet.java  import java.io.*; import javax.servlet.*; import javax.servlet.http.*;  public class InventoryServlet extends HttpServlet {    protected void doGet HttpServletRequest req,                         HttpServletResponse res      throws ServletException, IOException {       res.setContentType “text html" ;      PrintWriter out = res.getWriter  ;      String filePath = req.getParameter “inventoryList" ;      String theFile=””;      try {           theFile=getFile filePath ;      } catch FileNotFoundException e  {           out.println "File not found" ;      }      out.println "  " ;      out.println "  The File content is: “ +           theFile +  “ " ;      out.println "  " ;   }   public String getFile String path       throws FileNotFoundException {      String theFile="";      try {          InputStream is =           getServletContext  .getResourceAsStream path ;          BufferedReader br =            new BufferedReader new InputStreamReader is  ;          while  br != null  {               theFile += br.readLine   + '\n';           }                                             Problem Notification  171       } catch  Exception e  {           throw new FileNotFoundException  ;      }      return theFile;   } } If the file cannot be found, a   FileNotFoundException  String  whereby you write a   message to the output stream Writer explaining  what went wrong. In this simple example, the page continues to execute,  and the error message merely appears before the response content. The  following image displays the resulting output.   is caught,   sendError  Notice that the message is incorporated with the output stream data.   Although the page serves its purpose of informing the client, it isn’t the most  aesthetic or flexible approach.  Instead of simply sending debugging messages to the browser to display, it  might be more appropriate to return an error page. Web servers are able to  generate default error pages if and when a particular error is sent. In this sec- tion, we will discuss how to send an error and content to the web server for  an automatic error page response.   The   HttpServletResponse   class provides a   sendError …    method   that gives the developer an opportunity to set an error status code for the  response header and enables the servlet to replace the response body with  a server-specific page explaining the error. The method signature is as  follows:  public void sendError int sc  public void sendError int sc, String msg                                                              172  Chapter 5  cid:2   Handling Exceptions  The first parameter is an integer value defining the error code for the type  of problem that occurred. The second parameter is a   object used to  provide a custom message to the server-generated error page. The message  parameter is ignored if a custom error-page is provided for the passed-in sta- tus code. We will discuss that in more detail in the “Error Pages” section. Back to our example: instead of writing to the output stream when an   String  sendError …    status and message to the   error occurs, you can now set the  response object, as shown here:   res.sendError   … try {     theFile=getFile filePath ; } catch FileNotFoundException e  {            “The name of the file that could not be found is: “       + filePath   ; } … The provided error page is server dependent, but usually includes the   res.SC_NOT_FOUND,   sendError …   error code and an explanation. Depending on the error, the message entered  in the   method might or might not be included in the auto- matically generated page. The image might look similar to the following  graphic.  If the error code is changed to   410   or   SC_GONE  , the following output   appears. Notice how this page includes the   sendError …    message.                                                                                                 Problem Notification  173  Remember, the server has the choice to include or exclude the   message. For some errors it might include the message, and for others  it might not.  When using the   sendError …    method, three things should happen:    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2   An error response is sent to the client by using the specified status  code.  The servlet’s response body is replaced with an HTML-formatted  server error page containing the specified message.  The content type is set to  headers unmodified.   text html  , leaving cookies and other   A response is committed after it is sent to the client. When the     sendError …  method is used, the response is considered committed and should no longer  be written to. If the response is already committed and   should be thrown.

For example, iPlanet 4.  breaks  x . this rule; however, it is supported by iPlanet 6. x  IllegalStateException  sendError …    is   If a condition occurs that is not a problem, but just a status notification,   you can use the  response header. This topic is covered next.  setStatus      method to modify the    statusCode int  HttpServletResponse  The  gives the developer an opportunity to set the status code to notify the client  of the when there is no error for the response header. The method signature  is as follows:   class provides a   setStatus …    method that   public void setStatus int statusCode  This method sets the status by using a specified number or constant  XXX value defined in the HttpServletResponse class. The coding  SC_ preference, however, is to use the constant value rather than hard-coding  a number.  There is a fine difference between the setStatus int statusCode  method  and the sendError int errorCode  method: the setStatus …  method does  not generate an automatic error response page, whereas sendError …  does.  In fact, if you use setStatus …  to define an error, then the servlet is   setStatus   174 Chapter 5  cid:2  Handling Exceptions  completely responsible for generating the response. The body can be text based,  a generated image, or anything else appropriate. If an error page is not config- ured, a server-dependent Page Not Found message will appear. Later we will  discuss how to create custom error pages.  Stylistically, setStatus …  should be used for non-errors, such as SC_OK   or SC_MOVED_TEMPORARILY, whereas sendError …  should be used for  errors that are a part of the 400 and 500 series. A non-error is a flag that does  not indicate a critical problem.  When setStatus …  is called to define a non-error, the status code is set  and the servlet code continues to process. When setStatus …  is called to  define an error, the status code is set and an error page is sought in response.  If one is not found, a server-dependent Page Not Found message will appear.  Here is some sample code that shows how the setStatus …  method   should be used:  … try {     theFile=getFile filePath ;     res.setStatus res.SC_OK ; } catch FileNotFoundException e  {     res.setError res.SC_NOT_FOUND ; } If all goes well, the status is set to SC_OK; if not, a server-generated error   page is created and sent to the client.  The setStatus …  method is also useful when you have a servlet that takes  a long time to process. If written correctly, the servlet can be designed to  provide the client with intermittent updates on the state of the activity. If, for  example, a reload is required, a message notifying the client could be sent.  A call to the setStatus …  method does not commit the response, but it  does cause the container to clear the response buffer  causing any previous  response body information to be erased . As a result, this method should be  called early in the development of a response. In addition to erasing the  response body, the container will also set the Location header but preserves  cookies and other headers. If the response is already committed, calls to  setStatus …  are ignored.    Error Pages  Error Pages 175  Static Error Page  Until now, we have relied on default error pages or raw text sent   to the output stream Writer as means of conveying problems to the client.  There are a few more error page options worth discussing. There are three  types of error pages:   cid:2  Server-generated pages   cid:2  Static custom pages   cid:2  Dynamic custom pages  The default behavior of setStatus …  and sendError …  generates an  error page formatted by the server. In this section, we will address how static  and dynamic custom pages can be created and their associated benefits. We  will also cover how request dispatching can be used to pass error-handling  responsibility to another servlet.   A static error page is usually an HTML-formatted page that contains a  response to the occurring problem. Its information explains the problem, but  does not change. A status code is associated to the page through the deploy- ment descriptor.  For example, imagine that you created an error page called 404.html. It   could be as simple as the following:                  This is my error page for code: 404         By using the error-page tag, you could cause the status code value of 404   to display your page 404.html.                                404   176 Chapter 5  cid:2  Handling Exceptions                                   errors 404.html                   The error-code tag defines the status code for the problem. The   location tag defines the error file and its path. The value for the location  tag must begin with a forward slash     and it must refer to a resource  within the context. The following image shows the custom error-page  output.  Dynamic Error Page  It is important to know that entries in the web.xml file will override the   default server configuration error pages. If either sendError 404  or  setStatus 404  is called, the file 404.html located in the errors directory  of the context directory will appear. The benefit of static error pages is that  they provide standardized error responses for the entire application.   For a more flexible page response, you can create a dynamic error page.  Dynamic pages enable the message, the page, or the data to change depend- ing on the set error code. Instead of using HTML pages, a servlet could be  written to handle errors. The server provides two servlet attributes to help  accomplish this task:  javax.servlet.error.status_code returns an Integer object  defining the error status code.  javax.servlet.error.message returns a String message, usually  defined by the second argument passed to the sendError …  method.   Error Pages 177  A general-purpose error page must be defined within the location tag.   Here is sample code for web.xml:        …                             404                                  servlet ErrorServlet                     …   One dynamic page or servlet could be used for multiple error-codes; how- ever, each error code must be specified in the DTD file. Also, each error code  must have its own  …  element entry.  Instinctively, you might have thought to reference the ErrorServlet by using  the following path:  contextDir WEB-INF classes ErrorServlet. This, how- ever, will not work because of permissions. Remember, you cannot directly  reference files within the  WEB-INF directory. For Tomcat, servlet classes can  be accessed from the  servlet directory.  For iPlanet and JRun, you can configure the servlet so the path  servlet  ErrorServlet points to the default directory name  servlet under the con- text root. These servers do not automatically map the  servlet directory to  the  WEB-INF classes directory.  Listing 5.3 shows a sample servlet that generates a static error page when   invoked.  Listing 5.3: Custom Error Servlet  import java.io.*; import javax.servlet.*; import javax.servlet.http.*;   178 Chapter 5  cid:2  Handling Exceptions  public class ErrorServlet extends HttpServlet {    public void doGet HttpServletRequest req,                      HttpServletResponse res     throws IOException, ServletException {     res.setContentType “text html” ;     PrintWriter out = res.getWriter  ;      Integer code = Integer req.getAttribute                        “javax.servlet.error.status_code” ;     String msg = String req.getAttribute                        “javax.servlet.error.message” ;     out.println “ ” ;     out.println “ ” ;     out.println “ ” + code + “ ” ;     out.println “ ” + msg + “ ” ;     out.println “ ” ;     out.println “ Problem accessing “ +                       req.getRequestURI   + “ ” ;     out.println “  ” ;   } } When sendError …  or setStatus …  is called for an error, an instance  of ErrorServlet will extract the status code and message from the method  call. It will then display that information in a custom error page.  Going back to our earlier example in which we attempt to locate the   file  inventory Shampoos.html, let’s assume we are unable to do so, and  as a result create a message explaining which file could not be found.  The current servlet would need to create the message by extracting the file  name using req.getParameter “inventoryList”  and then using the  ServletContext’s getResourceAsStream String path  method to read  the path filename value assigned to the parameter. If the servlet invokes the  following method:  res.setError res.SC_NOT_FOUND, msg ;  the output will result in a servlet-generated page.    Error Pages 179  Passing the Error   This response page is simple, but shows you how dynamic pages can be  generated. You can create a more complex page that monitors error trends  to locate weaknesses in the system or application in addition to generating  error pages.  A dynamic page uses the web.xml file to locate an error servlet associated   to a defined error-code. If, however, your servlet would like to pass an  error to a specific servlet to handle, given a situation rather than an error  code type, you would need to use a RequestDispatcher. We will discuss  this technique next.  A servlet can handle its own errors or it can pass off the responsibility to  another servlet to handle. The RequestDispatcher can be used to forward a  request to an error page:  … try {     theFile=getFile filePath ; } catch FileNotFoundException e  {     String display = “ servlet ErrorServlet”;     RequestDispatcher dispatcher =        req.getRequestDispatcher display ;     dispatcher.forward req, res ; }  We have shown you how a basic RequestDispatcher works in Chapter 2,  “The Servlet Model.” When used for error handling, however, it is important  to know what information the target servlet can access.   When a call to sendError …  is made, the system sets the values for the   variables:   javax.servlet.error.status_code javax.servlet.error.message   180 Chapter 5  cid:2  Handling Exceptions  However, this is not the case with errors handled by the Request  Dispatcher. By forwarding the responsibility to the RequestDispatcher,  the calling servlet must set the error attributes. Otherwise, the output will  result in null values, as shown here.  After the code is changed to define the error attribute values, the output   will display the expected information, as shown after the following code  snippet.  … try {     theFile=getFile filePath ; } catch FileNotFoundException e  {     req.setAttribute "javax.servlet.error.status_code",             new Integer 405  ;     req.setAttribute "javax.servlet.error.message",              "Custom message: The file was not found" ;     String display = " servlet ErrorServlet";     RequestDispatcher dispatcher =              req.getRequestDispatcher display ;     dispatcher.forward req, res ; }  …  In summary, errors can be passed off to other servlets by use of the   RequestDispatcher. Because the web.xml file is not used by the processing    Logging Messages  Logging Messages 181  servlet, the error attributes must be set prior to forwarding the request. Next  we will address how to track these errors by logging messages.  The sendError …  method is designed to communicate errors or   problems to the client. This user-friendly description isn’t always beneficial to  the developer when the intent is to debug the situation. The GenericServlet  class offers two methods that enable the servlet to write its errors to a log file  for further inspection:   public void log String msg  writes an error message to the serv- let log file.  public void log String msg, Throwable t  writes an error  message and Throwable object, which contains a stack trace of  the exception, to the servlet log file.  The log file provides a way to track the servlet’s actions by displaying  detailed descriptions of the problems. The following example attempts to  locate a file that cannot be found. When the exception is caught, the name  of the file and a stack trace are written to the log file for future investigation.  A stack trace is the computer path taken to arrive at the current problem.  … try {     theFile=getFile filePath ; } catch FileNotFoundException e  {     log “The following file could not be found: “             + filePath, e ;     res.sendError res.SC_NOT_FOUND ; }  … The location and format of the log file is server dependent. The refer- ence implementation, Tomcat, provides a  logs directory that stores a  servlet.log file with all the messages logged by the application’s servlets.  At a minimum, each log usually includes the registered name of the servlet  and the associated time stamp for when the error took place.   182 Chapter 5  cid:2  Handling Exceptions  Reporting Messages  Reporting a stack trace message to the client is a bit more difficult than simply  executing a System.out.println e.printStackTrace    statement. In  fact, that statement won’t compile, because the printStackTrace   method  returns a void. To pass an error message to a client, the sendError …   method must be called. But before it can be passed a message, you must  capture the trace and write it to a PrintStream or PrintWriter. The  Throwable class provides methods that extract the trace; they include:  void printStackTrace   prints a Throwable object to a standard  output stream.  void printStackTrace PrintStream p  prints a Throwable object  to a specified print stream.  void printStackTrace PrintWriter p  prints a Throwable object  to a specified print writer.  Using the exception handle within a catch block, you can write the trace  to a stream or writer. Its data must then be converted to a String  possibly  using the BufferedWriter class’s write String s, int off, int len   method  and passed to the sendError …  method. The information will  then be displayed as part of the error page message.  When a method throws an exception, the developer has two choices:   the servlet can either catch the exception or throw it to the server to handle.  When a server catches an exception, it has complete freedom to handle the  problem in the way it deems appropriate. It could automatically log the excep- tion, it could pass the client a message, it could call destroy   on the servlet  and reload it, or it could do something else completely different.  The server cannot be expected to catch all exceptions. Specifically, the   specification states that those exceptions handled by the server must subclass  IOException, ServletException, or RuntimeException.   It is common for the server to handle these types of exceptions, as they can  affect the life cycle of the servlet. For example, if a servlet’s service   or   Servlet Exceptions   Servlet Exceptions 183  doXXX …  method literally throws the ServletException due to corrup- tion, the server knows the best way to respond to the problem and notify the  client. Generally, the server handles all RuntimeExceptions or any subclass  such as NullPointerException or ClassCastException . Because runtime  exceptions indicate problems in logic evident during the interpretation phase,  only the server can catch them.   It is not mandatory for a RuntimeException to be declared in a method’s  signature.   Now that we have discussed ways for a servlet to handle exceptions,  we will provide a closer look at the type of exception objects the server  can throw. The first is a ServletException, which indicates that a serious  problem occurred. The second is an UnavailableException, which notifies  the client that a servlet is not available. The last is a custom exception page  for known exceptions to send to the client. This feature enables developers  to provide custom exception pages for exception handling.  A javax.servlet.ServletException is thrown by a servlet to indicate a  general servlet problem has occurred. The ServletException class sub- classes the Exception class and has four constructors:   ServletException   is the default constructor that creates a basic  servlet exception used to provide a more descriptive name of the  problem.   ServletException String message  constructs a servlet exception  with the specified message.  ServletException Throwable rootCause  constructs a servlet  exception with a Throwable object containing a stack trace of the root  problem.  ServletException String message, Throwable rootCause  con- structs a servlet exception with a specified message and a Throwable  object containing a stack trace of the root problem.  ServletException   184 Chapter 5  cid:2  Handling Exceptions  UnavailableException  When an exception occurs, the developer might want to catch the exception   and throw it back to the calling thread with a different name. For example:  … try {     is.read  ; } catch  IOException e  {     throw new ServletException e ; } … The ServletException acts as a wrapper to provide a more relevant   exception name to the caller. Now, after the ServletException is caught, the  getRootCause   method can be called to return the Throwable object.  This method returns the Throwable object that contains a trace identifying the  original problem and source. If the exception was created without a  Throwable object, null is returned.  The javax.servlet.UnavailableException is a subclass of the Servlet  Exception class. An UnavailableException is thrown to indicate a servlet  is either temporarily or permanently unavailable:   Permanently unavailable The servlet throwing the exception cannot  recover from the error until some action is taken. Usually, the servlet is  corrupt in some way or not configured properly. Generally, the servlet  should log both the error and the actions needed to correct the problem.  Temporarily unavailable A servlet cannot handle the request for a  period of time due to some system-wide problem. For example, there might  not be sufficient memory or disk storage to handle requests, or a third-tier  server might not be accessible. Some of these problems are self-correcting,  and others might require a system administrator to take corrective action.  A servlet that throws an UnavailableException that is permanent is removed  from service, and a new servlet instance is created to handle further requests.  If a new instance cannot be created, an error will be sent to the client.    Servlet Exceptions 185  When a servlet is unavailable, the server will return a response containing  an SC_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE 503  status code to notify the client of the  situation. The response will also include a Retry-After header with an  estimated time of unavailability.  If either a temporary or permanent UnavailableException is thrown  during the init …  method, the service …  method will never be reached.  Instead, the server will try to initialize a new instance either immediately or  after the defined period of time.  The UnavailableException class has two constructors:  UnavailableException String msg  constructs an exception  with a descriptive message indicating the servlet is permanently  unavailable.  UnavailableException String msg, int seconds  constructs an  exception with a descriptive message indicating the servlet is tempo- rarily unavailable for an estimated amount of time.  When the exception is temporary and an estimated time cannot be pro- vided, the specification encourages developers to provide a negative value  for the second argument. Do keep in mind that the time is only an estimate.  After the exception is thrown, the component catching the exception can use  the following methods to learn more about the problem:  int getUnavailableSeconds   returns the number of seconds the  servlet expects to be temporarily unavailable.  boolean isPermanent   returns a boolean indicating whether the  servlet is permanently unavailable.  Planning for Error Handling  You are hired to participate in the development of a large web-based bank- ing application. Your role is to ensure that all potential errors are handled  in a manner that meets security and customer standards. The company’s  network is spread through the West Coast and maintains four servers in  different locations.   186 Chapter 5  cid:2  Handling Exceptions  Exception Pages  Recently you were notified that each system will be managed by a separate  group and is likely to have a different web server running the application.  This, of course, means you cannot rely on the server to handle errors  because the behavior of each is likely to differ. This consideration definitely  affects how the errors will be handled.  The bank is a franchise, which means the differences between each branch  must appear seamless to the customer. When a problem occurs, it must  be handled the same way in all branches. The client should see the same  message and expect the same results.  Because you cannot rely on the consistent behavior of each server, you decide  to develop a single ErrorServlet class that would handle all potential errors.  This single ErrorServlet class would display the common message to the cli- ent and perform any necessary logging to the log files. This solution would  alleviate much of the work required to create individual error pages and would  provide more maintainable code while satisfying the client requirements.   We have established that a server can choose to handle an exception in the  fashion it deems appropriate. The developer, however, can control the look  and content of the error page used to notify the client of server-handled  exceptions. Using the web.xml file and custom error pages, a web applica- tion can specify the exception page to display when a specific exception is  thrown. Earlier, we showed you how to display error pages for a particular  error code. Now we will show you how to display an exception page for a  particular exception type.  This sample code from the DTD shows how a static or servlet page can be   used when a specific exception is thrown:  …                 javax.servlet.UnavailableException                      servlet DynamicErrorDisplay         …   Servlet Exceptions 187  When the UnavailableException is thrown, the server will locate the   DynamicErrorServlet and display its contents to the client.  The exception-type must include the fully qualifying package name. Other- wise, the exception will be handled in its default manner.   By using error attributes, you can construct a dynamic servlet to handle  various exception types. Although the system might provide default values  for some of these attributes, the developer can also set their definitions at  some point within the application and share them with other servlets  depending on the definition scope. Table 5.1 lists the error attributes.

By providing the Throwable object, the message and type can be extracted,  thereby making javax.servlet.error.message and javax.servlet  .error.exception_type redundant. The two attributes are still included to  ensure backward compatibility.   188 Chapter 5  cid:2  Handling Exceptions  Listing 5.4 is a simple servlet that demonstrates how the attributes are  used to generate a generic error page. This code creates a basic error page  with the message associated with the exception and the location of the error.

We then extract the associated message to  incorporate the information in the response page.   Summary  Exam Essentials  Exam Essentials 189  In this chapter, we covered the various ways to handle errors. When a   problem occurs, you can catch the exception and handle the error by doing  one of the following:   cid:2  Printing a message to the client   cid:2  Providing a server-generated error page to the client   cid:2  Providing a custom generated page to the client   cid:2  Dispatching the request to another servlet to handle the error  Printing a message to the client requires a little work but does not ensure   a consistent response to an error. The second approach is the simplest  because you rely on the server to handle the error and generate the page.  The specification does not mandate how the server should handle errors or  exceptions, so once again you have the problem of inconsistency in a dis- tributed environment. The third and fourth options require more work  to develop the error and exception pages; however, you are guaranteed  consistency among servers.  Finally, this chapter focused on the exceptions thrown by the servlet. The   ServletException is thrown when a general servlet problem occurs.  The UnavailableException is thrown when a servlet is either temporarily  or permanently unavailable.  Be able to identify correctly constructed code for handling logic excep- tions and their behavior. When a method “throws” an exception, the  calling thread can either try to catch the exception or pass the responsi- bility to its calling thread. If a thread decides to “pass the buck,” it should  wrap the exception and log its path so the thread that finally handles the  error knows the originating source.  Be able to return an HTTP error by using the sendError response. When using the response object, you can invoke the sendError method  by passing the status code and a message. Assuming the output is not  committed, this causes the server to generate an error page with the  information provided.    190 Chapter 5  cid:2  Handling Exceptions  Be able to return an HTTP error by using the setStatus method. By  using the response object, you can invoke the setStatus …  method by  passing in the status code. This call does not automatically generate an  error page; instead you must provide a static or dynamic page in the  web.xml file for a response. Generally, this method should be used only  for setting the status of non-errors.   Identify the configuration that the deployment descriptor uses to handle  each exception. For all error pages, you should use the error-page tags.  If the page identifies a code, error-code is used to identify the value. If,  however, the page identifies an exception, the tag is exception-type. The  location of the file is found by using the location tag. Location values  must begin with a forward slash     and cannot identify servlets from within  the  WEB-INF directory.  Know how to use a RequestDispatcher to forward a request to an error  page. The RequestDispatcher can be used to forward handling of the  error to another servlet. If this procedure is followed, then attributes must  be set prior to the dispatch. The deployment descriptor must provide the  mapping necessary to locate the error handling servlet. It is then up to  the target servlet to handle the problem.  Identify the method used to write a message and an exception to the  WebApp log. The GenericServlet class offers a log …  method used  to pass a custom message, or a custom message and Throwable object, to  a server-specific log file.

At first, you might find this interesting; how- ever, soon your amusement would turn to irritation as they continually  asked you to repeat yourself. This is the scenario servlets would encounter if  their data could not be temporarily cached during a conversation with a web  application. When a client accesses a web application, they often supply  information that will be used by the application at a later period during the  conversation. If this information could not be retained, the application  would need to ask for the information again. This is both time-consuming  and inefficient. A servlet’s session object is used to resolve this issue. Sessions  provide various ways to monitor and maintain client data. In this chapter,  we will address how to:   Track a client’s session  Change a session’s data  Invalidate a session  Respond to the creation or destruction of a session object and its  attributes  Knowledge of how the session works will help you manage a session   object more efficiently. We will begin by discussing the various ways to track  a session.  I   cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2   W  Tracking Sessions  hen a client interacts with a server application, that client is likely  to make multiple requests to achieve a particular goal. Because the HTTP  protocol is stateless, it closes its connection after each request. Consequently,                                                                       Tracking Sessions  199  client data stored within a request is available for only a short period of time.  For a client object with a longer lifespan, a session is used. A    session object is usually created when a client makes its first request to an application.  It is unique to a client and can exist longer than a single request or even  longer than the life of a client. It is an object used to track client-specific  data for the duration of the conversation or a specified period of time.  What distinguishes one session from another is its unique ID. In fact, the  container uses this ID to map an incoming request to the correct session  object, which in turn is associated to a particular client. The actual client  information can be transferred by using one of three session processes:   cid:2    cid:2    cid:2   Using hidden form fields  Rewriting the URL  Using cookies  Our focus in this section will be to discuss the many ways to maintain a  session object. We will begin by addressing how to transfer a session ID by  using a form attribute type called   . hidden  Transferring information between an HTML form and a servlet can be done  in several ways. The most basic procedure is to transfer information back  and forth as data values. A form can contain fields with client-cached values  passed between each request. Because this information does not need to be  visible to the client, it is marked by using a field type of   . hidden  Imagine the following web application scenario:  A login screen is displayed.  The user enters their login name and password.  The servlet verifies the information and returns a web page for the  client to utilize the company’s services.  The new page stores the client’s login name from the previous servlet.  This information is not visible to the client, but is needed for checkout  purposes.  By using   hidden HTML values  , you can store client data between   servlets to use at a later date. The following HTML code produces the   1.  2.  3.  4.

The servlet then verifies the infor- mation and constructs a response containing the client’s information. The  following code shows this process.  Pay particularly close attention to  the bold text. It highlights how hidden values are transferred.   public class CarServlet extends HttpServlet {   public void doPost HttpServletRequest req,                       HttpServletResponse res     throws ServletException, IOException {     String login = req.getParameter "login" ;     String pwd = req.getParameter "pwd" ;       ...       verify login and password with database       Use database to get customer information like       their firstName, lastName, address         Customer cust = db.getCustomer login ;     String firstName=cust.getFirstName  ;     String lastName=cust.getLastName  ;     String address=cust.getAddress  ;       res.setContentType "text html" ;     PrintWriter out = res.getWriter  ;     ...       generate HTML form containing car characteristics     ...     out.println "<FORM ACTION=               ‘ servlet CheckOutServlet’ METHOD='POST'>” ;                                                         Tracking Sessions  201       out.println "<INPUT TYPE='hidden' NAME='loginName'               VALUE=’"+ login + "’>" ;      out.println "<INPUT TYPE='hidden' NAME='firstName'               VALUE=’" + firstName + "’>" ;      out.println "<INPUT TYPE='hidden' NAME='lastName'               VALUE=’" + lastName + "’>" ;      out.println "<INPUT TYPE='hidden' NAME='mailingAddress'               VALUE=’" + address + "’>" ;      ...      out.println " " ;   } } The    creates an HTML form response containing four hidden  values.

Typically,  the client does not even know the data is being sent back and forth. The dis- advantages to this approach are as follows:   cid:2    cid:2    cid:2   Tracking each hidden value in each servlet can become tedious. Unfor- tunately, as the session persists and information increases, passing  hidden data back and forth can become taxing.   The session can persist only through dynamically generated pages. If  there is a need to display static, e-mail, or bookmarked documents, the  session will be lost.   Hidden value transfers are the least secure method of maintaining  information between pages. Because HTTP transfers all data as clear  text, it can be intercepted, extracted, and manipulated. If someone  were watching the transmission between client and server, they could  easily read information such as the login ID and password.  Although there are many disadvantages, it is a simple approach that  can be used when you are communicating a small amount of noncritical  information.  Anonymous session tracking can also be done by using a technique called  URL rewriting. This approach to session tracking is used when clients do not  accept cookies  we’ll talk about cookies in the next section .    URL rewriting is a methodology that associates a session ID to all URL addresses used  throughout the session. Using the ID, a developer can map client-related data  to the session object for that client. The ID is temporarily stored until the  session has ended. After the session has ended, the ID and related data are   Rewriting the URL                                                              Tracking Sessions  203  discarded. Keep in mind that it is important for the session ID to have a stan- dard name that all containers can recognize. The specification defines that  . A standardized name enables the container to associ- name as  ate requests to their session objects stored on the server.   jsessionid  “Rewriting” the URL to contain the session ID enables any related servlet   to extract previously tracked data. There are two methodologies used to  rewrite a URL. One approach is to manually adjust the URL to include the  session ID, and the second approach is to use provided API methods to  encode the URL. We will cover both techniques in detail.  Manual URL Rewriting   Manually rewriting a URL can be done by physically adding the ID to the  constructed URL. How the ID is stored and accessed from within the URL  can vary. Table 6.1 lists several ways to rewrite the URL.  T A B L E 6 . 1  URL-Rewriting Approaches  URL  http:  localhost:8080 servlet  MyServlet  http:  localhost:8080 servlet  MyServlet 567  State  Original  Extra path information  http:  localhost:8080 servlet  MyServlet?jsessionid=567  Add parameter  http:  localhost:8080 servlet  MyServlet;jsessionid=567  Custom change  The first example in Table 6.1 shows the original path. The second   approach adds the session ID to the path directly. This approach works  on all servers, but isn’t very effective when other information must also be  added to the path of the URL. The third approach adds the ID as a parameter.  To avoid naming collisions and guarantee automatic mapping, the session  ID must be called  specific change that works for servers that support this technique. However,  .  even custom approaches are required to name the parameter  jsessionid  . The last approach uses a custom, server-  jsessionid                                                                  204  Chapter 6  cid:2   Session Management  In this section, we will show you how to rewrite the URL by adding a ses- sion ID to the URL path. But first, let’s talk about how the ID is generated.  The goal is to derive a value that is completely random and not shared. The  Remote Method Invocation  RMI  API provides several methods that help  develop such a method. The common procedure is to create a method that  does the following:  public static String generateSessionID  {     String uid = new java.rmi.server.UID  .toString  ;     return java.net.URLEncoder.encode uid ; } The    class is used to create a unique identifier on the host system  generating this value. For further complexity, the value is converted into  MIME-type format by using the     method.    uid String Fundamentally, the goal is achieved; when called, this method generates a  unique ID that can be used by a session on the existing system.  URLEncoder  encode   UID  ’s   Now you’re ready to learn how to “rewrite” the URL to contain the ses-  sion ID. We’ll begin by revisiting the URL structure:  Request URL = contextPath + servletPath + pathInfo   +   query   Given a request URL of    games Chess  , you can break the pieces into   string  their defined categories:  Context path:    games  Servlet path:  Chess  Path info:  null  Query string:  null  If you had a session ID with the value 567, that ID could be incorporated   into the URL by adding it to the path info section, as follows:   games Chess 567 Literally, this can be done by concatenating the session ID to the ACTION   value’s URL. For example:  out.println "<FORM ACTION=’ games Bingo "          + sessionID + " ” Method=’POST’>" ;  out.println " " ; Let’s say the current servlet that is running is called  games Overview.  On the page, there is a button with the text “Bingo.” When the button is  pressed, the current URL is switched to  games Bingo 567. This new    Tracking Sessions 205  servlet page provides the session ID within the URL, which enables the devel- oper to extract any data stored from previously accessed servlets. To access  the session ID, use the HttpServletRequest method getPathInfo  . This  method returns extraneous information between the servlet and the query  string. The new servlet can then use utility classes to retrieve data associated  with the session ID. Generally, you would expect to have a utility class for  writing data and its associated session ID to a location. The class should also  provide functionality to retrieve the client data based on a unique session ID.  You might expect the class to contain methods similar to those listed here:  public class SessionIDUtility {     public static String generateSessionID  {       String uid = new java.rmi.server.UID  .toString  ;       return java.net.URLEncoder.encode uid ;    }    public static void writeSessionValue Connection con,            String sessionID, String name, String value  {          write record to database for the provided          sessionID    }    public static String[] getSessionValues             Connection con, String sessionID  {         returns the values associated to the provided         sessionID    }   public static Object getSessionValue             Connection con, String sessionID, String name  {          returns the Object associated to the name          for a particular session ID    } } Given these methods, a servlet could save current data and retrieve it   from any other servlet accessed during the session. Figure 6.2 shows a simple  application that begins by asking the user for their name. A session ID  is generated to store the name for other servlets in the application to access.  When the user selects a game of choice, the new servlet accesses the session  information by retrieving the ID and then getting the user’s name. The  application should appear as shown in Figure 6.2.   206 Chapter 6  cid:2  Session Management  F I G U R E 6 . 2 Sample URL-rewriting application   index.html  OverviewServlet  CheckerServlet  BingoServlet  The first image is a simple HTML page that asks the user for their   name. When the Begin button is pressed, the  games OverviewServlet is  accessed and displays two game options. Before we go into the functionality  details, take a look at the source code for these files. Listing 6.1 displays the  HTML code necessary to launch the initial program.  Listing 6.1: index.html          Welcome to the Game Center                 <FORM ACTION=' games OverviewServlet'               METHOD='POST'>              Please enter your name to play:                <INPUT TYPE='text' SIZE='20'                                    NAME='name'>               <INPUT TYPE='submit' VALUE='Begin'                                   NAME='button'>                    The file index.html simply provides a form for the user to submit their  name. When a request is triggered, the OverviewServlet is invoked. The  code for this class is shown in Listing 6.2.   Tracking Sessions 207  Listing 6.2: OverviewServlet.java  import javax.servlet.*; import javax.servlet.http.*; import java.io.*; import java.util.*; import java.sql.*;  public class OverviewServlet extends HttpServlet {     public void doPost HttpServletRequest req,                          HttpServletResponse res        throws ServletException, IOException {         String name = req.getParameter "name" ;         String sessionID =           SessionIDUtility.generateSessionID  ;          Connection con =  Connection            getServletContext  .getAttribute "Connection" ;         SessionIDUtility.writeSessionValue con,           sessionID, "name", name ;          res.setContentType "text html" ;         PrintWriter out = res.getWriter  ;         out.println "  " ;         out.println " The Game Center " ;         out.println " Press a button to play: " ;          out.println "<FORM ACTION=’ games Checkers " +           sessionID + "' Method='POST'>" ;         out.println "<INPUT TYPE='submit' VALUE= " +            " 'Checkers'> " ;         out.println "<FORM ACTION=’ games Bingo " +          sessionID + "' Method='POST'>" ;         out.println " " ;         out.println "   " ;    } }   208 Chapter 6  cid:2  Session Management  Listing 6.2 shows how the servlet prepares to rewrite the URL. First, the  user’s name is acquired, and then a unique session ID is generated for that par- ticular user. A preassigned connection is accessed from the ServletContext  and used to write the session ID and name to a local database. Finally, the page  is generated with each button linked to a different URL including the session  ID. If the user selects Bingo, they will access the BingoServlet. Listing 6.3  displays the code for this class.  Listing 6.3: BingoServlet.java  import javax.servlet.*; import javax.servlet.http.*; import java.io.*; import java.util.*; import java.sql.*;  public class BingoServlet extends HttpServlet {    public void doPost HttpServletRequest req,                          HttpServletResponse res        throws ServletException, IOException {         String sessionID = req.getPathInfo  ;         String userName=””;         if  sessionID == null  {                Redirect the user back to the login screen.               If a session ID is null, it indicates the                user has not logged into the system.         }          Connection con =  Connection            getServletContext  .getAttribute "Connection" ;         userName =  String SessionIDUtility.getSessionValue            con, sessionID, "name" ;          res.setContentType "text html" ;         PrintWriter out = res.getWriter  ;         out.println "  " ;         out.println " Your turn: “ + userName +                      “ ” ;            generate the bingo game         …     Tracking Sessions 209  Using Methods to Encode the URL          out.println "For help, click “ +            “<A HREF=’ servlet Help ” + sessionID +            “?rules=Bingo’>Click here for help ” ;         out.println "   " ;    } } Listing 6.3 shows how the servlet accesses the session ID from the URL  path by using the request method getPathInfo  . Remember, this method  returns the path information listed after the servlet path and before the query  string. A connection to the associated database is acquired, and the session  ID is used to extract data associated with the current user. After the name  value is obtained, it is incorporated into the Bingo page. Finally, a hyperlink  is used to provide help; it too contains the session ID value, in case the Help  servlet needs the session-related user data.  Instead of manually generating a session ID and physically adding it to the  URL, the API provides methods that manage the task for the developer. The  HttpServletResponse class offers the following two methods:   cid:2  public String encodeURL java.lang.String url    cid:2  public String encodeRedirectURL java.lang.String url   The encodeURL …  method rewrites the specified URL to include a ses- sion ID if needed. If one is not needed, the method returns the original URL.  An unchanged URL can result from a server that does not support URL  rewriting or from a server that has the feature turned off. As for the seman- tics of how the URL is encoded, that feature or technique is server-specific.  In general, it is good practice to have all URLs emitted by a servlet run  through this method to ensure application-wide access to the session ID.  The second method is similar to the first in that it, too, encodes the   passed-in URL by adding the session ID. It differs, however, in when it is  used. At times there is a need for a servlet to temporarily redirect a response  to a different location. This is done by using the HttpServletResponse’s  method sendRedirect String url . Before calling this method, the URL  should be encoded by using a method specifically designed to handle  URL encoding for a redirected response: encodeRedirectURL String url .  The reason for using a different method is that a redirect URL is different  from a normal URL. For a redirect URL, all non-ASCII values must be    210 Chapter 6  cid:2  Session Management  converted to their hexadecimal values; this includes ampersands and equal  signs. For a normal URL, the ampersands and equal signs do not need to be  converted to hexadecimal format. This distinction is critical and necessary  for the sendRedirect …  method to work. The following is an example of  a rewritten URL:  http:  localhost:8080 servlet CheckOutServlet; jsessionid=4347 To encode links in your URL, you must make slight modifications to the  HTML code. Here is an example of how to rewrite the URL to include an  encoded URL in a form:   String urlSession =   res.encodeURL " servlet CheckOutServlet" ;   out.println "<FORM ACTION=’" + urlSession + "‘” +                   “ Method='POST'>" ; out.println " " ; out.println "   " ;   If your intent is to encode a URL for a link, you simply include an encoded   String instead of the standard URL:  out.println “Click “ +  “<A HREF=’”+ res.encodeURL “ servlet CheckOutServlet”  +  “‘>here ” ; In order for the container to encode the URL with a session ID, three   conditions usually exist:   cid:2  The browser supports URL encoding.   cid:2  The browser does not support cookies.   cid:2  The session tracking feature is turned on.  When using the encodeURL …  method, the session ID is stored as a   path parameter. As such, you must call req.getPathInfo   to retrieve the  ID value.  You can also access the ID by calling req.getSession   to acquire a handle to  the actual session object  assuming one exists . Using the session instance, the  ID value can then be accessed by calling session.getId  . This object is cov- ered in more detail in the upcoming “Using the HttpSession Object” section.   Using Cookies  Tracking Sessions 211  The servlet can also use the following HttpServletRequest methods to  learn more about the methodology used to generate the ID, as well as its  validity:    cid:2  public boolean isRequetedSessionIdFromCookie     cid:2  public boolean isRequestedSessionIdFromURL     cid:2  public boolean isRequestedSessionIdValid    These methods validate the session object and its place of origin. If the ses- sion is not valid, the servlet can redirect the user to a new screen to log in  again. If the session ID was obtained from the URL, the servlet might opt to  perform a different task than if it was obtained from a cookie.  Another way to perform session tracking is through persistent cookies.  Remember, a cookie is an object containing small amounts of information  sent by a servlet to a web browser, then saved by the browser, and later sent  back to the server. Because the cookie’s value can uniquely identify a client  and maintain client data, using cookies is an optimal way to track sessions. A cookie is created by using two parameters: a name and a value. The con-  structor is as follows:  public Cookie String name, String value  Unlike a hidden value, which must exist in all servlet pages, a cookie is   added to the servlet’s response object and is propagated to all servlets accessed  during the session.   The servlet specification mandates that the name of the value used to track the  session for a cookie must be called JSESSIONID.  The ID name must be all uppercase when used within a cookie, but lowercase  when used in URL rewriting.  A cookie can be added to an HttpServletResponse object in the follow-  ing way:  Cookie cookie = new Cookie “JSESSIONID”, “567” ; res.addCookie cookie ;   212 Chapter 6  cid:2  Session Management  If another servlet is interested in accessing this information, it can call the   getCookies   method of the HttpServletRequest class:  public Cookie[] getCookies   Using our example from the preceding “Rewriting the URL” section, you  can create a cookie to add the session ID. Listing 6.4 demonstrates how to  use cookies to rewrite the OverviewServlet.  Listing 6.4: Using Cookies with the OverviewServlet   import javax.servlet.*; import javax.servlet.http.*; import java.io.*; import java.util.*;  public class OverviewServlet extends HttpServlet {    public void doPost HttpServletRequest req,                       HttpServletResponse res       throws ServletException, IOException {       String name = req.getParameter "name" ;       String sessionID =          SessionIDUtility.generateSessionID       Cookie cookie = new Cookie “JSESSIONID”,                                     sessionID ;       res.addCookie cookie ;        res.setContentType "text html" ;       PrintWriter out = res.getWriter  ;       out.println "  " ;       out.println " The Game Center " ;       out.println " Press a button to play: " ;        out.println "<FORM ACTION=’ games Checkers ’” +                          " Method='POST'>" ;       out.println "<INPUT TYPE=’submit’" +                     " VALUE=’Checkers’> " ;       out.println "<FORM ACTION=‘ games Bingo ’" +                     " METHOD=’POST’>” ;   Tracking Sessions 213          out.println " " ;          out.println "   " ;    } } The BingoServlet can then use its request object to get all the cookies asso- ciated with the session. The modified code would look similar to Listing 6.5.  Listing 6.5: Using Cookies with the BingoServlet   import javax.servlet.*; import javax.servlet.http.*; import java.io.*; import java.util.*; import java.sql.*;  public class BingoServlet extends HttpServlet {    public void doPost HttpServletRequest req,                          HttpServletResponse res        throws ServletException, IOException {         String sessionID;         String userName;         Cookie[] cookies = req.getCookies  ;         if  cookies != null  {           for  int i=0; i<cookies.length; i++  {              String id = cookies[i].getName  ;              if id.equals “JSESSIONID”   {                   sessionID = cookies[i].getValue  ;                  break;              }           }         }           Connection con =            getServletContext  .getAttribute "Connection" ;         userName =             String  SessionIDUtility.getSessionValue               con, sessionID, "name" ’;         res.setContentType "text html" ;         PrintWriter out = res.getWriter  ;         out.println "  " ;   214 Chapter 6  cid:2  Session Management          out.println " Your turn: “ + userName +                    “ ” ;            generate the bingo game         …           out.println "For help, click ” +             “ ” +            “Click here for help” +            “ ” ;         out.println "   " ;     } } In this example, we get all the cookies associated with the request. We filter  through each cookie until we come across the one called JSESSIONID. By using  the assigned ID, the doPost …  method can then use the getSessionValue …   method within the SessionIDUtility class to get the user’s name. In our  example, we could have just added the user’s name to the cookie. Instead, we  opted to show you the approach using a session ID value because a session usu- ally contains more than one data element. Notice the hyperlink to the Help  servlet no longer contains the ID value within its URL. When the Help servlet  is invoked, it will receive the existing session cookies within its request object. The final and most convenient way to handle session data is to pass an  HttpSession object, which implicitly contains the client’s data, back and  forth between all session-related servlets.   Previously, we discussed ways to track the session object between client   server requests, where each example  cookie or URL rewriting  used a database  for persistent storage of session data. In this section, the HttpSession object  replaces the database for persistent storage, and uses one of the methods pre- viously discussed to propagate the session ID.   Internally, the container determines the method used to transmit the session  ID between the client and server  whether it used cookies or URL rewriting .  The servlet creates an HttpSession object to maintain data for the entire   duration of a transaction. Assuming the client’s browser supports session   Using the HttpSession Object   Using the HttpSession Object 215  management, an HttpSession object is created when the client first accesses  a web application. Data can then be written to or retrieved from this object.  It is important to understand that a session exists only within its original  context. For example, if a servlet uses the RequestDispatcher to forward its  request to another application, a new session is created that is different from  the calling servlet.  To access a session object, use the HttpServletRequest method: public HttpSession getSession   The method returns the HttpSession object tied to the client requesting  the current servlet. If the object does not exist, the getSession   method  will automatically create a new HttpSession instance.   The other method used to access a session object is as follows: public HttpSession getSession boolean create        This method differs from the previous version in that it requires a   boolean value:  not exist.    cid:2  A true value creates a new session object if one does not already exist.   cid:2  A false value prevents a session object from being created if one does   A false value is really what distinguishes this method from its over-  loaded getSession   method. Instead of creating a new session without  further validation, the developer might want to redirect the user back to a  login page before a session is created. Once created, the session object will  continue to accumulate stored data until the session is terminated.   Data is stored to an HttpSession object as attributes:  public void setAttribute String name, Object value   The setAttribute …  method binds a Java object to a specified key   name. Another servlet can then use the HttpSession object and access its  data by using the following method:  public Object getAttribute String name  The getAttribute …  method uses the key name to find and return the   associated object.   Once again, let’s revisit the OverviewServlet in Listing 6.4 to see how   this approach changes the code. See Listing 6.6.   216 Chapter 6  cid:2  Session Management  Listing 6.6: Using an HttpSession Object with the OverviewServlet  import javax.servlet.*; import javax.servlet.http.*; import java.io.*; import java.util.*;  public class OverviewServlet extends HttpServlet {    public void doPost HttpServletRequest req,                        HttpServletResponse res        throws ServletException, IOException {         String name = req.getParameter "name" ;          HttpSession session = req.getSession  ;         session.setAttribute “name”, name ;          res.setContentType "text html" ;         PrintWriter out = res.getWriter  ;         out.println "  " ;         out.println " The Game Center " ;         out.println " Press a button to play: " ;          out.println "<FORM ACTION=’ games Checkers ’” +                       “ Method='POST'>" ;         out.println "<INPUT TYPE='submit' VALUE=’” +                       “ Checkers‘> " ;         out.println "<FORM ACTION=’ games Bingo ’” +                       “ Method='POST'>" ;         out.println " " ;         out.println "   " ;    } } Using the session object is both a clean and convenient approach to   storing client data. The actual session instance is stored at the web appli- cation level, whereby each ServletContext maintains its own pool of  HttpSession objects.   Using the HttpSession Object 217  Remember, each application has one ServletContext, and each context has  multiple sessions for each client that accesses the application.   Retrieving the attributes is as easy as adding them. Listing 6.7 is the   BingoServlet modified to use the session object to either redirect the user  back to a login screen  if the session object is null  or to extract client data.  Listing 6.7: Using an HttpSession Object with the BingoServlet  import javax.servlet.*; import javax.servlet.http.*; import java.io.*; import java.util.*;  public class BingoServlet extends HttpServlet {    public void doPost HttpServletRequest req,                       HttpServletResponse res                   throws ServletException, IOException {          HttpSession session = req.getSession false ;         if session == null  {            ServletContext sc =              getServletConfig  .getServletContext  ;            RequestDispatcher disp =              sc.getRequestDispatcher “ servlet login” ;            disp.forward req, res ;            return;          }          String userName =            String session.getAttribute “name” ;                  res.setContentType "text html" ;         PrintWriter out = res.getWriter  ;         out.println "  " ;         out.println " Your turn: “ + userName +                    “ ” ;   218 Chapter 6  cid:2  Session Management             generate the bingo game         …            out.println "For help, click “ +           “ ” +           “ Click here for help ” ;         out.println "   " ;    } } The preceding example demonstrates two ideas. The first is how a servlet  can redirect a request to a login screen if a session does not exist. The second  is how a servlet within the same context automatically receives session data  acquired from previous servlets. This is shown by using the getAttribute …   method. The key value name is passed as a parameter to access its associated  object. Remember, the name value was set by the OverviewServlet.   Adding an attribute is as easy as removing one. To unbind an attribute,   call the method:  public void removeAttribute String name   After this method is invoked on an attribute, it is no longer accessible by   any servlet within the application.  The final method of interest is the one that enables a servlet to list all the   attributes associated with the current session:  public Enumeration getAttributeNames   The getAttributeNames   method returns an Enumeration object of  all current attributes. If a session has no attributes, a null value is returned. Sometimes there is a need to respond to changes to a session’s attributes.  The servlet API provides several session listener classes designed specifically  for this purpose.  HttpSessionBindingListener  By implementing the HttpSessionBindingListener, your application can  be notified when an object is bound or unbound to a session object. The  interface has two primary methods that must be defined:   cid:2  valueBound HttpSessionBindingEvent event    cid:2  valueUnbound HttpSessionBindingEvent event    HttpSessionListener  Using the HttpSession Object 219  The valueBound …  method is called before the object is made available  through the getAttribute …  method. In contrast, the valueUnbound …   method is called after the object is no longer available via the  getAttribute …  method of the HttpSession interface. The listener is  passed an HttpSessionBindingEvent, which contains the session object,  the name, and the value of the object either bound or unbound to the session.   Both methods are public and have a void return value.  By implementing the HttpSessionListener, your application can be noti- fied when a session is created or destroyed. The interface has two primary  methods that must be defined:   cid:2  sessionCreated HttpSessionEvent event    cid:2  sessionDestroyed HttpSessionEvent event   As intuition would suggest, the sessionCreated …  method is called after   the session is produced. In contrast, the sessionDestroyed …  method is  called to notify the application that the session was invalidated. Each method  provides a handle to the HttpSessionEvent object. This instance provides  access to the session object.  Both methods are public and have a void return value.  To register session listeners to the container, you must include the   listener tag in the web.xml document. For example:                  ConnectionPoolHandler         The container determines the type of listener defined and then establishes  an abstract link between the session and the listener. When changes occur to  the session, the appropriate listener is notified.   220 Chapter 6  cid:2  Session Management  Invalidating Sessions  For a more detailed explanation of these two listeners, review the discussion  on HttpSession listeners in Chapter 4, “The Servlet Container Model.”   So far, we have covered how to create and maintain sessions by using   several approaches—as well as how to respond to session changes. It is now  time to discuss how sessions are invalidated.  A session can be invalidated in multiple ways. It can expire automat-  ically, after a specified or default period of inactivity, or a servlet can  explicitly invalidate a session through method calls. Before learning about  these options, it is important to understand the effects on the application  and client when a session is nullified. Basically, all the attribute data is lost.  If you want to retain session information after it is invalidated, it should be  stored to an external resource such as a database or a long-term cookie. For  example, say you have a user who has a login name and password stored  to a database. When they log into the system, a session is created and data  is added to monitor their activity. After they log off or a session is about to  be terminated, the data can be stored to that user’s name or account in a  database for later retrieval. Brokerage firms are known for using this  approach as a means of justifying their user’s transactions.  Logically, you would expect a session object to terminate when the client is   done with an application. You would expect this to occur when the client  leaves the site, terminates the browser, or simply walks away from the appli- cation for a period of time. Unfortunately, the application is not notified when  such occurrences take place because of the nature of the HTTP protocol.  The HTTP protocol is stateless, and by design will close the connection after  each request to the server. As a result, an application is not notified after each  connection is closed.  Because the server cannot distinguish the intent of the client, the server  will keep the session alive during inactive periods for a default period. To    Invalidating Sessions 221  change that default time, the web.xml document can be modified to iden- tify the number of minutes the server will keep the session alive during  inactive periods.  The session-config tag holds all configuration tags for the application’s  session. The session-time tag defines the number of inactive minutes a ses- sion will exist before the server terminates the object. The following is sample  code for the web.xml file used to change the default termination period:         …                                 15                        The servlet specification requires that the timeout value be specified in whole  numbers. Some servers allow the use of negative values to indicate that ses- sions should not be terminated. The server’s documentation will provide  more details on this capability.  A second approach to modifying the life of a session is to have individual   servlets define the inactive time period before a session is destroyed. The  HttpSession interface provides the following methods:   cid:2  public void setMaxInactiveInterval int secs    cid:2  public int getMaxInactiveInterval    These methods allow fine-grained control. Instead of applying a time   period to the entire application, you can set the time to specific servlets. The  benefit of this approach is that you can customize the timeout period per user  or after certain activities have taken place, such as a lengthy database lookup.   Notice that the time is measured in seconds rather than minutes.  The getMaxInactiveInterval   method returns the value set. If the set  method is not used and the time is set by using the session-timeout tag, the    222 Chapter 6  cid:2  Session Management  getMaxInactiveInterval   method will return the timeout value defined  within the web.xml file.  The third approach is pretty abrupt. The HttpSession interface provides   the following method:  public void invalidate   throws IllegalStateException After a handle to the session is obtained, the invalidate   method can  be called to close the session and unbind all associated objects. If the session  is already invalidated, then an IllegalStateException object is thrown.  Now that we’ve covered how to end a session, it is important for you to  understand the best practices associated to a session’s timeout period. Given  specific scenarios, you should know whether a session object would be inval- idated sooner versus later. Table 6.2 breaks down the strategies.  T A B L E 6 . 2 Session Invalidation Strategies  Type  Example  Session Time-out  Periods  Explanation   Secure web  applications  Online banking Shorter   Database connections  Shorter   No database  connections  Longer   Stores  Longer   News sites  Depends  Resource- intensive  applications  Non- resource- intensive  applications  Shopping  cart applica- tions  Applications  that cache  database  information  Prevent imposters  from invading  abandoned  systems.  Enable servers to  reclaim or release  resources quickly.  Maximize conve- nience rather than  focusing on server  scalability.  A timeout might  cause client to for- get original items.  Shorter period  results in a larger  cache. Longer ses- sions cause the  database lookup to  process slower.   Invalidating Sessions 223  Determining how an application should manage a session is achieved by  balancing convenience, user security, and server efficiency. A site that logs a  user off too quickly could become amazingly inconvenient for users who  need to take short breaks from a transaction to check e-mail or take a phone  call. For security purposes, however, you don’t want to keep certain sessions  open for extended periods of inactivity. Imagine a bank web application that  stores the user’s login and account information in a session. If the data  remains available while the user has stepped away from the application for  an extended period of time, there is greater risk of fraud. Finally, efficiency  should be considered. A client session might be using resources that are  “expensive” to the system, such as a database connection. The longer this  object is maintained, the slower the application and server might run. In such  cases, sessions should not have long inactive periods.  Detailed Session Management  Investments, Inc. is interested in providing their customers with online  access to their investment accounts. The application must enable users  to place orders, purchase stocks, and sell stocks. All clients will need to  establish secure login accounts to access their private information. As a  consultant, you are asked to design a session strategy that will best meet  the company’s security needs and provide client convenience.  One of the biggest concerns of the company is to ensure that decisions  made by the client can be validated. A partnering company recently had a  client claim they did not intend to purchase a particular batch of stocks.  Because the company did not maintain every procedure taken by the client,  they could not prove the client was responsible for their own error.  To minimize complexity, you have decided to utilize the session object pro- vided by the servlet API. Whenever the user triggers an event, all entered  information and trigger options are written to the session. Because security  is a huge priority, inactive periods are kept to a minimum. If the user is in the  middle of a transaction and has to leave the application, they would prefer  to log in again rather than risk the corruption of their account.   224 Chapter 6  cid:2  Session Management  Summary  Finally, you must consider when to store the information to a database.  Normally, the session data is removed after the object is removed. To  retain it for legal purposes, you want to write the session data to a data- base before the session is terminated. To ensure that the data is written  before the session is invalidated, you create an HttpSessionListener.  After the session is destroyed due to inactivity or the user logs out, which  would cause a call to session.invalidate  , the listener is notified and  the sessionDestroyed HttpSessionEvent e  method is called. By using the  HttpSessionEvent, you can retrieve a handle to the session object to extract  all the data and write it to a database. The end result is an application that  provides security and a legal trail.  In this chapter, we covered the various ways to manage a session object.   We began by discussing the ways to monitor or handle session data; those  processes are as follows:   Method 1: Hidden values  out.println "<INPUT TYPE=hidden” +                    “NAME='mailingAddress'” +                    “VALUE=’" + address + "’>" ;   Method 2: URL rewriting  out.println "<FORM ACTION=’ games Bingo " + sessionID +                      "‘ METHOD='POST'>" ;  or  String urlSession = res.encodeURL " servlet MyServlet" ; out.println "<FORM ACTION=’" + urlSession + "‘” +                      “ Method='POST'>" ; out.println "   " ;    Method 3: Cookies  Cookie cookie = new Cookie “JSESSIONID”, “567” ; res.addCookie cookie ;   Exam Essentials  Exam Essentials 225  Method 4: Sessions  HttpSession session = req.getSession  ;  We then addressed ways to invalidate a session and the associated strat-  egies. Here are the three ways to invalidate a session:   cid:2     60 < session-  timeout>    cid:2  HttpSession.setMaxInactiveInterval …    cid:2  HttpSession.invalidate    Finally, we discussed the circumstances in which you should provide long   versus short inactive periods for a session.  Be able to identify the interface and methods for a session object retrieved  across multiple requests to the same or different servlets within the same  WebApp. The HttpServletRequest class provides a getSession    method that returns an HttpSession object for the specific client.  Be able to identify the interface and methods to store and retrieve objects  to and from a session object. The HttpSession interface provides a  setAttribute String name, Object value  method to store an object  and a getAttribute String name  to retrieve a bound object.  Be able to respond to an event when a particular object is added to a  session. When an object is added to a session object and implemented,  HttpSessionBindingListener is notified and its valueBound   HttpSessionBindingEvent e  method is called. When an object is  removed, the listener’s valueUnbound HttpSessionBindingEvent e   method is called.  Be able to respond to an event when a session is created and destroyed. An implementation of the HttpSessionListener will enable your applica- tion to receive notification of when a session object is created or destroyed.  The interface contains a sessionCreated HttpSessionEvent e  and  sessionDestroyed HttpSessionEvent e .    226 Chapter 6  cid:2  Session Management  Be able to identify the interface and methods to expunge a session  object. The HttpSession interface provides the invalidate   method  to terminate a session object.  Identify the most common ways a session object can be invalidated. A  session can be invalidated three main ways. One is by modifying the  web.xml file to define a default timeout period by using the session- timeout tag. The second process is to specifically modify the session’s time- out period by using the setMaxInactiveInterval int sec  method. The  third approach is to call invalidate   on the HttpSession object.  Given that URL rewriting must be used for session management, identify  the design requirements on session-related HTML pages. URL rewrit- ing is a way to transfer the session ID or data by including it in the URL.  The generated HTML pages must include the URL link plus the session  ID, either directly or encoded by using the encodeURL String url  or  encodeRedirectURL String url  method.

The receiving  servlet can then extract the additional information to utilize the data.  2. D.  A session is reliant on HTTP transactions. Because the application’s   communication with the client is through the HttpServletRequest  interface, and the session is not transmitted back to the client, the ses- sion object is obtained via the HttpServletRequest interface.   3. D.  The setAttribute String name, Object obj  method binds   an object with a related key name to the session object. The other  methods are all illegal.   4. C.  The invalidate   method terminates the associated session and   then unbinds any objects bound to it.  5. D.  The ServletContext is associated with the web application, not   with the individual client session. Consequently, data stored to the  context is not unique to a client.  6. C.  The timeout tag defines the minimum number of minutes of   inactivity that can pass before a session can be inactive before being  terminated by the server.   7. A.  A session timeout value tells the amount of time the session will   stay alive only during an inactive period, not its entire life.  8. C.  Because a client usually collects multiple items in a cart, a short- lived inactive period could cause problems and irritation to the user.  This could result in a loss of business because the user might not want  to return or might forget what they already selected.  9. D.  Depending on how the session timeout period is set, the   getMaxInactiveInterval   method will return the number of  seconds that the inactive session will exist before termination.  10. C.  The session-config tag requires the session-timeout tag to  define the number of minutes a session can be inactive. As for doing  nothing, the server usually has a default inactive period defined  automatically.   232 Chapter 6  cid:2  Session Management  11. D.  The getAttribute String name  method returns the object   bound to the session by using the associated name reference.  12. A, B.  The encodeURL String url  method encodes the specified  URL by including the session ID in it. If encoding is not needed, the  method returns the URL unchanged.  13. C.  The valueUnbound, lowercase b, method is called when an object  is unbound from the session object. An HttpSessionBindingEvent is  passed to the method containing the session object, and the name and  value of the object removed can be gathered from this event object.   14. A.  The servlet specification mandates that the valueBound …    method should be called before the object is made available through  the getAttribute   method.  15. B.  The HttpSessionListener is called when a session is created and   destroyed.

Security Issues M  A  s computer technology advances, the number and type of  services available over the network increases. Convenience, however, has  a price. The transfer of critical information creates business vulnerabilities  that many wish to overlook. For numerous companies, the one area that  requires the most attention receives the least: security. Security is a crucial  aspect of any application that exchanges privileged information. In this  chapter, we will address the basic weaknesses a system faces and identify  key elements that should be considered to create a secure system and limit  exposure to outside threats.  ost people find entertainment in sports, movies, talking, and other  benign activities. However, many individuals receive amazing satisfaction  and gratification from invading systems and either corrupting or capturing  vital data. These individuals, known as  , thrive on  system vulnerabilities. Utilizing various hacker tools, they are often able  to scan systems to locate holes through which they can enter and attack. For  many it’s a game, and for others it’s personal. Regardless of the motive,  securing your web application should be a priority to ensure the integrity of  your data and application. This process begins by implementing the four  basic security principles:  attackers  hackers   or   Authorize  Authenticate   cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2   Provide data confidentiality  Monitor access                            Security Issues  235  In addition to these principles, we will also discuss the following security   concerns:   cid:2    cid:2   Malicious code  Website attacks  Authorization  The onset of the Internet caused network security to become a huge concern.  When Java first hit the market, it was known as the Internet language. It  marketed applet development as the product that provided a secure environ- ment for clients accessing unknown sources over the Internet. However,  restricting applet access to the client system was not a successful solution to  security. Instead, other means of protection were needed to enable autho- rized access without limiting functionality.  The Java language has matured since its creation and now offers several  technologies to authorize an outside user access to a server application. The  concern is no longer focused on the applet client, but rather a J2EE client   servlet or JSP  attempting to access an enterprise application.   When a client requests information, the server has no way of determining   who is making the request. The client’s IP address fails to define the user  because that user can attempt to access a server from various computers. In  addition, it is easy for a user to falsify their IP address to disguise their identity.  Consequently, the server must determine the client via user authorization,  which we’ll explain in just a moment.   Figure 7.1 provides a visual representation of these two approaches to   security: the client-server approach, in which the aim is to secure the client,  and the J2EE approach, in which the aim is to secure the server.

This process, whereby the client makes a claim to be a particular user,  is called   authorization  principal  .  After the client identifies themselves, they must provide evidence to prove  they are truly who they claim.   is the process whereby the  client supplies credentials to prove their identity. Most often proof is provided  via a password. Other examples include the swipe of a card, retinal scans,  fingerprints, or digital certificates located on the user’s system.  Authentication  Java Authentication and Authorization Service   With the introduction of the Java Authentication and Authorization Service   JAAS  API, authentication can be handled by utilizing pluggable modules  configured to authenticate by using something as simple as a username  and password or something more complex, for example, a SmartCard reader.  JAAS provides an enterprise application a variety of services for authenti- cation on the back end. As vendors standardize this API, you will see more  and more applications using complex pluggable modules rather than devel- oping basic authorization code. JAAS is bundled in the Java Developer  Kit 1.4 or available separately at the Sun website.   Access control fails if others can gain access to password or authentication  information as it is transmitted over the network. Encrypting information  protects data and provides another level of security. The protocol called  Secure Sockets Layer  SSL  was developed to use public key cryptography  to encrypt communication between the client and server. A   is an  encryption scheme, either generated by software or issued by a third party,  used to encode or decode information. Sitting between the HTTP and TCP IP  protocol, SSL encrypts the data to prevent hackers from acquiring confi- dential information. Anyone attempting to intercept the data transfer will  simply encounter indecipherable nonsense.  public key  Data Integrity                                                                  Auditing   Security Issues  237  Two main security concerns are solved when using public key crypto- graphy. The first is confidentiality. Because the data is encrypted, you are  guaranteed privacy. The second is integrity. As long as the information can  be decoded properly by the intended recipient, you can be fairly sure that the  data was not tampered with during transmission.  Auditing users is a way of ensuring that users who log in successfully access  only those resources that are appropriate to their role. The servlet security  model is  Manager, Employee, or Guest. Each role is assigned certain privileges, and  access is granted to roles rather than users. To determine whether to provide  a client with access to a given resource, the server:  . This means that users are assigned to roles, such as   role-based  Discovers which roles are available   Checks to see which roles are allowed  1.  2.  3.  Checks to see whether the user is assigned to any available roles  Notice that security evolves around the role rather than the user. By using  a server-specific tool, users are mapped to particular roles. The granularity  of permissions can be defined at a finer level. By using the tool or the deploy- ment descriptor, you can specify the method permissions for each role  as well.  Access for each role can be denoted in two ways: through declarative   security or programmatic security.  Declarative Security   uses the deployment descriptor to specify which resource  Declarative security a role can access. The advantage of this approach is that implementing security  is independent of source code; when security changes must be made, there is no  need to recompile or make changes to the code.

Within the    tag, you can then define which roles have access to   auth-constraint   tag. Do keep in mind   role-name   within the authorization group.   Users and roles are usually mapped to an   access list   stored by the server.   Sometimes it’s a simple file containing each user’s login name, password,  and role. Other times it’s stored as a database with encrypted employee  information.  When discussing BASIC authentication later in this chapter, we will go into  more detail on user mapping and show you how Tomcat manages user  role information.  Programmatic Security  At times declarative security is not specific enough. You might need to limit  access within a particular method based on a user. This kind of granularity  requires security to extend itself to the method source code, which is done  by using  , you  might want to determine who is making the request and then, based on the  result, determine whether to execute a particular response.  . Within a method such as   programmatic security  doGet …                                                              Security Issues  239  There are three Java methods within the   javax.servlet    class that provide information about the user   .HttpServletRequest making a request:    String getRemoteUser   log in to the website.   returns a String of the username used to       isUserInRole String boolean role  accessing the servlet is assigned to the passed-in role.   indicates whether the user     getUserPrincipal   Principal  object representing the user who is logged in. .Principal   returns a   java.security   Here is an example of how programmatic security can filter activity based   on the user:  import javax.servlet.*; import javax.servlet.http.*; import java.io.*; import java.util.*;  public class AccessServlet extends HttpServlet {     public void doGet HttpServletRequest req,                       HttpServletResponse res        throws ServletException, IOException {                                                     res.setContentType "text plain" ;         PrintWriter out = res.getWriter  ;          String username = req.getRemoteUser  ;         if  username == null  {             out.println "You are not logged in." ;         } else if  "Mary".equals username   {             out.println "Hello Mary,                     glad you can join us" ;         } else {             out.println "Hello " + username ;         }         out.close  ;     } }                                 240  Chapter 7  cid:2   Secure Web Applications  Depending on who makes a   GET   request, the message returned is different.   Mary gets the most personal message, whereas general users simply get a  .  basic “Hello.” If you are not logged in,  null This example has Mary assigned to the role of GeneralUser. With this said,  the deployment descriptor would look like the following:  getRemoteUser     returns                                   AccessServlet                                    serlvet AccessServlet                                              GeneralUser                            All users assigned to the role of GeneralUser have access to the   AccessServlet. Within the servlet, we use programmatic security to deliver  a different message depending on the user. Each tag will be thoroughly  discussed in the BASIC authentication section.  As you can see, declarative and programmatic security can be used   together. The downside of defining security measures within code is that  changes to security will result in the need to recompile the code.  In the technical world, the term malicious code is synonymous for virus.  Unfortunately, many people thrive on developing software that locates  system vulnerabilities and attacks. Sometimes the code is kind enough to  simply overflow a particular folder with messages of love, but other times  viruses have been known to wipe out entire hard drives. There are no flags  or method calls that can protect your system against these types of assaults.  One solution is the use of antivirus software. Antivirus software is critical in   Malicious Code   Website Attacks  Authentication Types 241  keeping your system safe from potential code attacks. Simply installing the  software is not enough. Staying current is most important. Because new  viruses are being developed every day, the software must be updated on  a regular basis. The goal is to stay one step ahead of the attacker.  When establishing a website, assume the site will be attacked. Even if the  information isn’t critical, hackers often use systems for the sole purpose of  hiding their trail. By bouncing from machine to machine, they can arrive at  a destination with a trail too difficult to trace. One form of protection is the  utilization of a firewall.   Firewalls block network traffic by limiting access to most all ports and  unauthorized users. Once again, the firewall requires the client to provide  proper authorization to enter the system. Unfortunately, firewalls are not  foolproof in that there are ways to bypass security by impersonating  another.  Another consideration to help against attacks is the installation of intru-  sion detection tools. There are a number of tools you can use to detect  attackers. Packet sniffers, for example, enable you to view all the traffic on  your network. If any activity looks odd, you can use your firewall to block  the intruder.  At a minimum, a protected system requires firewalls, intruder detection,  and antivirus software. All these preventive techniques can succeed only if  user authentication isn’t compromised. In the next section, we will discuss  the different ways to authenticate a user.  Authentication Types  The web container provides four authentication techniques to deter-  mine client validity:  BASIC authentication requires the client to provide a user login name  and password in order to access protected data.  FORM authentication adds a bit of elegance to logging in. It enables an  application to request authorization by using a customized HTML page.    242 Chapter 7  cid:2  Secure Web Applications  BASIC  DIGEST authentication provides a little bit more security in that it  encrypts the login name and password to prevent others from acquir- ing this privileged information while it travels over the network.  CLIENT-CERT authentication stands for client certificate. This  approach requires the client to provide a digital certificate containing  information about the issuer, signature, serial number, key type, and  more. Basically, it is a complex object used to identify the client.  In this section, we’ll show you how each technique is used to gain autho-  rization to the web application.   The simplest form of authentication is known as HTTP Basic authentica- tion, or BASIC. As its name indicates, an application utilizing this form  of certification asks for basic information, such as the user’s login name and  password. The data is then transferred to the server by using BASE64  encoding for validation. The good news is that this process is easy to  implement; the bad news is that it doesn’t offer much security beyond  authenticating the client. If intercepted, the username and password could  easily be decoded by running a simple BASE64-decode on the data. If a web- site provides information that is not critical for an exclusive group, BASIC  could be an option.   When a user attempts to access information protected in this fashion, the  browser will automatically display a dialog box requesting the user’s login  name and password. This process is automatic and cannot be customized. You must identify within the deployment descriptor the code requiring   protection, the type of authentication, and who is to gain access. When  the client attempts to access this code, a dialog box similar to the image  in Figure 7.2 appears.  F I G U R E 7 . 2 BASIC authorization dialog   Authentication Types 243  One of the benefits Java offers is the ability to define security outside the  application source. There is no need to recompile Java code when security  options are changed. When using servlets, the security permissions are  defined within the web.xml file. Before discussing the needed DTD elements,  we begin by looking at a simple servlet:  import javax.servlet.*; import javax.servlet.http.*; import java.io.*; import java.util.*;  public class PrivateServlet extends HttpServlet {     public void doGet HttpServletRequest req,                        HttpServletResponse res        throws ServletException, IOException {               res.setContentType "text plain" ;         PrintWriter out = res.getWriter  ;          out.println "You are accessing                private information" ;     } } This servlet serves no other purpose but to print a message. Our goal is to  restrict access to this servlet to a small group of privileged users. To accom- plish this task, we must modify the web.xml file to include our security  requirements. There are three groups to include, and their order is critical:  security-constraint, login-config, and security-role.  The security-constraint Element  The first tag group that must be defined is     . These tags are critical in that they define what  code is protected. The following sample shows what elements are included  within this constraint:                          SecretProtection                       244 Chapter 7  cid:2  Secure Web Applications                    servlet PrivateServlet                             servlet Secret                                  GET                                           POST                                                   Broker                                            Administrator                 Within the security-constraint, there are two sub-elements:   cid:2  web-resource-collection   cid:2  auth-constraint  The web-resource-collection element defines three important   features of the protected code:  The web-resource-name is the name used by a tool to reference the  servlet. The name must be specified even if a tool is not used.  The url-pattern indicates the URL pattern to the source code  requiring protection. If alias names are used to reference servlets,  those too should be included.  The http-method indicates all HTTP methods that should have  restricted access. If no HTTP method is specified, then all methods are  protected.   Authentication Types 245  Remember: the methods defined within the http-method element apply to all  servlets defined by the url-pattern element.  The auth-constraint element defines any number of roles that can  have access to the protected code. Remember, all users belong to roles.  For example, a user with a login of Bob14 can belong to the Broker and  Employee roles. This information is usually defined within a server-specific  access list or database. Tomcat uses the conf tomcat-users.xml file to  characterize each group. The file might look similar to the following:          <user name="Tim21"  password="secret"                       roles="Administrator"  >   <user name="Bob14"  password="secret"                        roles="Broker, Employee"  >      The login-config Element  The second tag group is defined within the  < login- config> tags. It is here that the type of container authentication is defined.  The following sample shows what elements are included within this constraint:               BASIC                        Default                    Within the login-config tags, there are two sub-elements:   cid:2  auth-method   cid:2  realm-name  The auth-method element is used to define authentication types of Basic,   Digest, form-based, and client-side certificates. Specifically, the methods  must be defined as BASIC, DIGEST, FORM, or CLIENT-CERT. Keep in  mind that these method types are case sensitive.   246 Chapter 7  cid:2  Secure Web Applications  The realm-name element is used by the BASIC authentication to identify   a specific area of a website. For example, if there is a member area of the  website, this value might be “Members Area.”  The security-role Element   The final basic security tag group is defined by the     tags. Within these elements are defined roles the appli- cation might use to limit access. Generally, this listing is beneficial to tools  because they provide the application assemblers or deployers a list of roles  to select from to assign to methods.                  Represents all fulltime employed individuals.                     Employee          Within the security-role tags, there are two sub-elements:   cid:2  role-name   cid:2  description  The role-name tag is required and defines available roles for the appli-  cation to utilize. The description tag, as the name implies, provides a  description of the particular role being listed.   In summary, BASIC authentication requests client authentication when  a request for protected data is made. To set up this process, the web.xml  file must be configured to include security-constraint information,  which defines what data is protected, login-config data, which defines  the type of authentication the container should implement, and finally  it must define the available roles by using the security-role tag.  FORM  In an attempt to provide more elegance to the art of validating users, Form- based authentication is available. Rather than rely on the browser’s default  pop-up dialog to request the user’s login name and password, the application    Authentication Types 247  can provide its own custom form to request this information. The benefit  to the Form approach is aesthetic. Essentially you can guarantee that all  users, regardless of which browser they use, will see the same login screen   possibly with the company’s logo displayed .   Several requirements are necessary to ensure that the custom form com-  municates correctly with the server’s access list:   cid:2  The form method must be POST.   cid:2  The action or URL must be defined as j_security_check.   cid:2  The name attribute for the username must be j_username.    cid:2  The name attribute for the password must be j_password.  Utilizing these values enables the server to access the correct attributes  given the standardized names. Let’s take a look at a simple custom form.  We’ll call it Login.html:                Welcome to my custom login screen!          Name: <INPUT TYPE=’text’ NAME=’j_username’                                      SIZE=15>         Password: <INPUT TYPE=’password’ NAME=’j_password’                                            SIZE=15>                             As you can see, each name is defined by the standard rules and results in   a custom form that can be used for login purposes. See Figure 7.3.  F I G U R E 7 . 3 Custom authentication form   248 Chapter 7  cid:2  Secure Web Applications  If the user attempts to log in but fails, you can no longer rely on the   browser’s error dialog box. Consequently, when creating a login form, you  must also create an error form. Once again, we will keep it very simple and  define the following Error.html page:                You failed to log in successfully.       Hit the “Back” button to try again.         On their own, the Login.html and Error.html pages are not linked— meaning when the user presses the OK button, there is no direct connection  to the error page. Instead, the two pages “communicate” via an intermedi- ary. Basically, when someone tries to log in, the server verifies authenticity  of the client by using j_username to get the username and then using  j_password to get the password. If there is a failure, the server must be able to  find the error form to display. The connection between the code and server  is made within the web.xml file. Once again, you need to make modifica- tions to this document to inform the server of the name and whereabouts  of the login and error pages used during FORM authentication.  The one area that changes is within the login-config tags. In addition  to identifying the type of authentication, you must also define the location  for the custom login page and custom error page:                  FORM                                     AuthenticationForm.html                                  Error.html                   Within the login-config tags, you not only define the type of authenti-  cation, but if it is of type FORM, then you include a sub-element group  called form-login-config.   Authentication Types 249  The form-login-config Element  Fundamentally, this tag is used to help the server locate the forms to display  during appropriate times. The two sub-elements are as follows:   cid:2  form-login-page   cid:2  form-error-page  As their names indicate, the form-login-page tag defines the login page  that should be used when a request for protected code is made. This page is  displayed instead of the default login dialog box used with BASIC. Similarly,  the form-error-page defines the error page that will be displayed if autho- rization is denied.  Customizing your login and error page displays is fairly easy. The trick is  to follow the naming conventions within your login pages and modify the  deployment descriptor to locate those files.  As we have said, one of the greatest security limitations of BASIC authenti- cation is that information is transferred over the network in simple BASE64- encoded text. Someone snooping the line can easily capture a client’s user- name and password to gain access to the site. DIGEST adds an extra layer of  security when authenticating the user. Instead of transferring the password,  the server creates a nonce, a random value that is unique. An example of a  nonce could be the client’s IP address followed by a time stamp and some  random data. It might look something like this:   127.0.0.1: 86433665446: dujehIIJRTGDKdkfj The server sends the nonce to the client, and then things get interesting.   The client uses a secure encryption algorithm to create, or hash, a digest.  A digest is a one-directional, encrypted value that represents data. In this  case, the digest consists of the nonce, username, and password. Figure 7.4  shows the simple process used to generate a digest.  DIGEST  F I G U R E 7 . 4 Creating a digest  Nonce Username Password  Digest  algorithm  Digest   250 Chapter 7  cid:2  Secure Web Applications  F I G U R E 7 . 5 The DIGEST process  After the digest is generated, the client sends the digest back to the server.  The server then uses the nonce it sent originally and the username and pass- word on file to generate a digest on its end. The server compares the digest  sent by the client to the one generated locally. If they match, the client  can access the protected resource. If not, access is denied.   In place of transferring the password over the network, the digest is trans- mitted. Using the same algorithm type, the server computes a digest of the  password for the particular user and compares values to see whether they  match. If so, the client is valid. Figure 7.5 illustrates the process.  1. Server generates and sends nonce.  Server  Client  2. Client uses nonce, username, and      password to generate digest and      then sends it.  3. Server uses nonce, username,     and password to generate its     own digest.  4. Server compares client digest     to server-generated digest.  5. Server validates or invalidates the client.  The nonce is critical in that it protects against attackers who intercept the  hash value and intend to reuse it at a later date. Because the nonce contains  a time stamp and a random value, the request will most likely time out and  be removed from the server at a later time, causing the client’s request to be  invalidated.   Unix administrators are familiar with password encryption. Often pass- words are stored in a secure file. However, if someone manages to gain  administrative access, they can view this information. Because passwords  are considered extremely sensitive and critical data, the OS encrypts them  so even the administrator cannot know these values. If an attacker captures  the hashed password digest, they will not have access to the user. Instead  they will need to guess various passwords and generate a digest to see  whether there was a match. This is because a digest is considered a one-way  transformation of data.   CLIENT-CERT  Authentication Types 251  Most browsers implement DIGEST authentication in their own manner,  making it difficult to set up and use. If it were easier, then HTTP authenti- cation could widely provide useful low-level security.  HTTPS Client authentication, or CLIENT-CERT, is the strongest form of  authentication. HTTPS is HTTP over Secure Socket Layer  SSL . Instead  of simply providing a username and password, the client must provide that  information in addition to a personal certificate for authorization to access  the server.  A client certificate is an encrypted object, known as a signature, person- alized with data for a particular person. It provides a secure way to authen- ticate users communicating over a network. Instead of simply logging into  a system and providing a password, which can be decrypted, the user  provides a certificate that can be read only by using a special key. Client  certificate technology is comprised of two pieces: a digital signature and  a digital certificate.  A digital signature is an object that associates an individual with a partic- ular piece of data. It adds one more level of security to a digest. Not only is  it providing authentication, but it also links the user to the data. This means  that the request cannot be intercepted, re-signed, and sent by an imposter  without the server realizing the error.  Keys are a critical part of understanding how the validation process   occurs. Prior to any login attempts, the client generates two keys. The first is  a private key that holds the individual’s authentication code and is stored  in a secure location, on a SmartCard or in a file. It should be known and  accessed only by its owner. The second is a public key given to all receivers  to validate the authenticity of the user attempting to log in. When using serv- lets, the server stores all public keys of users who can access the system in a  database or Lightweight Directory Access Protocol  LDAP  directory server.  Then when a client tries to access a protected site, they are prompted to pro- vide a username and password. When transmitting this information, a digest  is generated along with a digital signature by using the client’s private key.  The digest is then sent to the server, which uses its public key to unlock the  signature. If the public key is a forgery and not part of the key pair used  by the private key, the signature will not unlock, and the user is invalidated.  Figure 7.6 demonstrates the process.   252 Chapter 7  cid:2  Secure Web Applications  F I G U R E 7 . 6 Digital signatures  Sender  client   Private key  Message  Digital  algorithm  Digest  Signature algorithm  Digital signature  Receiver  server  Public key  Digital signature  Signature algorithm  Digest and message  Digital signatures provide integrity by guaranteeing that the data hasn’t  changed since it was signed. Basically, it is impossible for an attacker to re- create the signature with a new set of data without access to the user’s private  key. Any alteration of data invalidates the digital signature. In addition, a  digital signature also provides authentication because after someone signs  something, they cannot deny having done so.   Scenarios that were previously threatening pose no or little threat when   using certificates. Here are some potential scenarios:   cid:2  If the object is retrieved during its commute to its destination by an  unauthorized receiver, that person will be unable to extract its infor- mation because they lack the key.    cid:2  Because the certificate also has a time stamp associated with it, a   retrieved certificate is invalidated after a period of lapsed time; thus it  cannot be forged during future login attempts.   cid:2  Obtaining a stolen public key serves no purpose because although it  allows you to verify the person sending the certificate, it does not grant  you access to the system they are attempting to access.  Unfortunately, digital signatures are not 100 percent safe. When a public  key is delivered to a user, there is a possibility that an attacker will acquire  this value. You cannot be certain your public key belongs to the client  intended unless the key was transferred in an absolutely secure environment.  A common problem is known as man-in-the-middle attacks. Someone places  themselves between the client and server and manages to intercept the    T A B L E 7 . 1 Certificate Information  Authentication Types 253  authentication and pose as a valid user. If they manage to intercept and alter  the public key, then they can configure the public key to recognize a false  signature. The goal is to prevent them from manipulating the public key  maintained at the target site. One solution to protecting a public key during  its transfer is to encrypt communication or use direct connections; the other  is to use digital certificates.  Digital certificates attach identity to a public key. They act like a driver’s  license or passport in that they prove you are who you claim to be. A certif- icate contains your public key and some additional information signed by a  third party’s private key. Companies such as Versign and Thawte, known as  a certificate authority  CA , sell certificates to individuals to enable them to  sign their public key. Usually a certificate contains the information outlined  in Table 7.1.  Information   Description  Version  Version of the certificate  v1, v2, v3 . Each version  contains different attributes.  Serial number  Integer value unique to the CA issuing the  certificate.  Signature algorithm Algorithm used to sign the certificate.  Subject  Whom the certificate is issued to. This item can  include a common name, organization or organi- zational unit, the organization’s location, state,  and country.  Subject public key  Public key of the certificate. This is the most  important piece.  Signature  Signature signed by the CA.  If a single attribute is changed, the certificate is invalidated. When information  needs to be altered, the CA needs to reissue a new certificate.   254 Chapter 7  cid:2  Secure Web Applications  Instead of sending a public key to intended recipients, you transfer a cer- tificate. If the certificate is intercepted and altered, the certificate and the key  within are invalidated. Consequently, the man-in-the-middle technique fails  to compromise the client or server. Of course, there is room for certificate  corruption. If the certificate authority is not reliable, they can create forged  certificates, allowing attackers to act as imposters.  For the most part, client certificates provide the most security but do  require the most work. When data transactions are critical and security  is essential, a client certificate ensures authentication, authorization, data  integrity, and confidentiality. By designing a site where the client must ini- tially provide a certificate and then a digest with each request, you can be  almost fully assured that the client is who they say they are and the data they  are sending is in its original form.  When Security Is a Priority  You have just been hired to work on securing a website managed by the  government. Fairly secretive information is available on this site for officials  to access while off site. Your role is to ensure that only authorized users are  granted access and to protect the information from malicious attacks.  Due to the sensitive nature of the information, high security is a priority— which means BASIC, FORM-based, and DIGEST authentication are not  options. Mandating certificates becomes the primary option. Each user’s pri- vate key can be stored on a SmartCard; however, that limits usage to systems  that have readers for this device. For systems without this mechanism, you  could provide users a CD-ROM containing their authentication information.  Because most browsers fail to automatically support client authentication,  you must develop the code to handle the security measures. As a precaution- ary measure, this machine should be separate from the main system, and at  a minimum a firewall would sit between the two. Multiple firewalls betweens  layers of systems and security clearance will further secure the system  against harmful attacks. In case others try to attack, the systems should be  audited regularly. By using advanced tracking tools, you can notify appropri- ate members when security breaches are made. Because of the multiple lay- ers of the system, the intruders can hopefully be stopped before accessing  critical information. Through these checks and balances, an application can  provide significant security and access to its intended audience.   Deployment Descriptor Tags 255  Deployment Descriptor Tags  In this chapter, we’ve discussed almost a third of all the deployment   descriptor tags the exam will cover. Now that you’ve read about each piece  separately, we want to provide a final sample of how security is handled as  a whole within the web.xml file. See Listing 7.1.   Listing 7.1: Web.xml—Authentication                                secret                                 SalaryServlet                                                                SecretProtection                                              servlet SalaryServlet                                              servlet secret                                             GET                                             POST                 256 Chapter 7  cid:2  Secure Web Applications                                                    manager                                                            FORM                                                     AuthenticationForm.html                                              Error.html                                  Part of your success on the exam depends on your knowledge of each tag,   its order, and purpose. Table 7.2 lists all the tags used for security in the  deployment descriptor.

The location and file used to display a  custom error page.  Element   http-method  auth-constraint  role-name  login-config  auth-method  form-login-config  form-login-page  form-error-page  Summary  In this chapter, we covered the key elements a developer should con-  sider to ensure security for their application. Depending on the private  nature of the web application, you should consider the following issues:   cid:2  Authorization   cid:2  Authentication   cid:2  Data integrity   cid:2  Auditing  access control    258 Chapter 7  cid:2  Secure Web Applications  You should consider each topic and aim for a balance between conve-  nience and importance. Servlet containers offer four types of authentication  used to ensure different levels of security:  BASIC The most simple and least secure is HTTP Basic authentication.  It requests the user’s login name and password and transmits the data in  a simple encoded format.  FORM To avoid using the browser’s authentication dialog, you can use  Form-based authentication. This process enables you to customize your  authentication and error pages to suit your website.  DIGEST Added security can be achieved through HTTP Digest authen- tication. Instead of transmitting your password over the network, a digest  is submitted between client and server.  CLIENT-CERT The last type discussed is HTTPS Client authentica- tion. It offers the most security and provides the most guarantees by  requiring clients to have a private key and a corresponding certificate  in order to be authenticated.  To enable security in the application, modifications to the web.xml  file are required. Several tags are used to identify the resources that are  protected, the location of those resources, the type of authentication used,  the methods that can be accessed, and the roles a user must belong to for  privileged access.  Be able to describe the security issues associated with authentication and  authorization. Validating the user is a critical measure that you must  consider for most applications. Not only must the client claim to be a par- ticular user, but they must also provide evidence, such as a password or  certificate, to prove their identity. Once authenticated, their roles will  define what files they are authorized to access.  Be able to describe the security issues associated with data integrity. When information is transferred over the network, there is potential for  interception. Without some form of encryption or security measures, an  attacker can intercept the data prior to its arrival for storage or to make  alterations before sending it back on its way.  Exam Essentials   Exam Essentials 259  Be able to describe the security issues associated with auditing. Rather  than allowing all users to access to all resources, it is important to estab- lish roles, which allow users to utilize only necessary resources. Auditing  user access helps ensure security by limiting access to protected areas.  Be able to describe the security issues associated with malicious code. Code that is sent with the intent to do harm is considered malicious code.  The most common form is known as a virus. To avoid such attacks, anti- virus software is recommended to screen incoming data. If the code is  coming from within, authorizing each user is a way to place responsibility  on the source.  Be able to describe the security issues associated with website attacks. Again, there is a great possibility that attackers will want to infiltrate a  website for the purpose of gathering or destroying information. Authen- ticating the user makes this option a little more difficult, but firewalls are  a must as well. They shield critical information from the end user or the  attacker.   Be able to identify the deployment descriptor element names and their  structure for a security constraint. The security-constraint tag is  used to define protected resources and which roles have access to those  areas. It contains two main sub-elements: web-resource-collection  and auth-constraint.                               Be able to identify the deployment descriptor element names and their  structure for a web resource. Protected resources are referenced by the  web-resource-collection. Within this tag are sub-elements called web- resource-name, used to define the name of the protected resource,  url-pattern, used to define the location of the protected resource, and  optionally http-method, used to define the methods with access.                        260 Chapter 7  cid:2  Secure Web Applications                       Be able to identify the deployment descriptor element names and their  structure for login configuration. The login-config tag is used to  define authentication rules for the application. The sub-element auth- method identifies the type of authentication. If it is of type FORM, then  you must also include the form-login-config tag to define the custom  login and error pages.                                                                      Be able to identify the deployment descriptor element names and their  structure for a security role. Access is granted to protected resources  based on roles. The auth-constraint tag uses the role-name tag to define  which roles have access to the protected resources of the application.                             Be able to identify the correct definition of BASIC authentication. HTTP Basic authentication relies on the default authentication dialogs of  the browser to request the user’s login information.  Be able to identify the correct definition of DIGEST authentication. HTTP Digest authentication uses a message digest in place of transferring  the user’s password.   Key Terms 261  Be able to identify the correct definition of FORM authentication. HTTP Form-based authentication enables the application to provide its  own authentication and error page.

T  hreads seem to be a topic that most developers wish to avoid  but can’t. In a single-threaded environment, ensuring the integrity of a Java  class is as easy as making all instance variables private and providing public  accessor or mutator methods. In a multithreaded environment, achieving a  “thread-safe” application is a bit more complex. Ensuring application integ- rity is a difficult task when multiple users have the ability to access and alter  the same information simultaneously. When multiple clients concurrently  access a single object’s data, the application becomes vulnerable to several  negative conditions. Those conditions include: object state corruption  the  data produced is inaccurate , production of unreliable results  based on inac- curate data , race conditions  more than one thread is competing for data  access before it might even exist , and, finally, deadlock  threads are left idle,  unable to move forward . To avoid such situations, it is critical for develop- ers to consider the importance of an object’s state and how it is handled.   When developing for a multithreaded environment, threading issues cannot  . This means a single  be avoided. Servlets are intrinsically  instance can be accessed by more than one thread. Because servlets, by their  nature, are designed for multiple users, creating a thread-safe environment is a  vital key to the success of the application. In this chapter, we will discuss the  various ways to handle data and their related threading issues. We will also  address the significant differences between a single versus multithreaded model.   multithreaded  S  ervlets offer a variety of options for storing data. The important   points to learn from this chapter are how various data elements are stored  and how they are affected by threads. Each variable or attribute provides a  different level of scope, which affects access by the user or users. Here is a list  of the data types we will discuss in depth in this section:  Local variables  Short-term values that are often used as loop iterators  Attributes                                                  Attributes  271  Instance variables all concurrent users  Data that persists for the life of the servlet, shared by   Data that exists for the life of the application, shared by   Class variables all concurrent users—including instances with different initialization  parameters  Request attributes the   RequestDispatcher  Data passed to other servlets invoked by   Data that persists through all future requests for   Data shared by all servlets that persists for the life   Session attributes the current user  Context attributes of the application  In general, concern for thread-safety should be applied only to instance and   class variables. Here are the reasons why: All threads share the same heap,  and the heap is where instance variables are stored. When multiple threads are  accessing the same variable, there is potential for data corruption, because  more than one thread can access the same instance variable. Class variables  have a similar problem; they are stored within the same JVM method area. This  means multiple threads can use the same class variables concurrently. Because  all threads share the same heap and method area, there is a chance multiple  threads will access the same instance or class variable and corrupt its value.  Local variables, method parameters, and return values are quite different.   These variables reside on the Java stack. The JVM awards each thread its  own Java stack. Because each thread has its own set of local variables,  method parameters, and return values, there is no need to worry about mul- tithreaded access. Table 8.1 identifies each variable discussed and indicates  whether it is architecturally designed to be thread-safe.   T A B L E 8 . 1  Which Variables Are Thread-safe  Variable Type  Thread-safe  Class  Instance  Local  Parameter  Return  No  No  Yes  Yes  Yes                                                         272  Chapter 8  cid:2   Thread-Safe Servlets  Now that you have a general understanding of how threads affect the dif- ferent variables, we will discuss how to avoid problems with each variable type.  Local Variables   are defined within the body of a method. This limits the  Local variables variable’s scope to the life of the method—leaving little or no threading  issues to worry about. As each requesting thread accesses a servlet’s method,  a new local variable is assigned to each. Consequently, only one thread  accesses a servlet’s local data. Listing 8.1 provides a simple example of a  servlet using a local variable.  Listing 8.1: Using Local Variables  import javax.servlet.*; import javax.servlet.http.*; import java.io.*; import java.util.*;  public class LocalVariableServlet extends HttpServlet {      public void doGet HttpServletRequest req,                       HttpServletResponse res        throws ServletException, IOException {         int count=0;                              res.setContentType "text plain" ;         PrintWriter out = res.getWriter  ;          count =  init  Math.round Math.random   ;         out.println "Count = " + count ;      } }    Listing 8.1 creates a new   count   variable for each thread accessing the    method. A random value is generated and rounded to the nearest  doGet …  integer value. It is then assigned to the   variable to finally print to the  response output stream. Figure 8.1 provides a visual representation of how  four threads accessing  variable. By design, local variables are thread-safe.  LocalVariableServlet   obtain their own     count  count                                                 F I G U R E 8 . 1  Clients obtain their own local variable  Attributes  273  Client thread 1  int count  Client thread 2  int count  Client thread 3  int count  doGet     Servlet instance  Client thread 4  int count  Instance Variables   are defined within the class body and are separately   Instance variables assigned to each instantiated object. However, because servlets are often  instantiated by the container and service multiple requests, it is likely that  many threads will access the same servlet instance and its variables. This  behavior defies the basic threading rule, which states that more than one  thread should not access the same object. Breaking this rule can result in data  corruption if not handled correctly.   why  Understanding the servlet life cycle helps clarify    instance variables  are susceptible to concurrency issues. A servlet is either initialized when the  web container first starts up or when the servlet is called for the first time.  Once created, the instance is stored for client access. Each client accessing the  servlet invokes the same instance. This means the client will view and modify  the same instance variables as the previous client. Listing 8.2 defines a    count variable that is incremented when each thread makes a   request to the  InstanceVariableServlet  GET   class.  Listing 8.2: Using Instance Variables  import javax.servlet.*; import javax.servlet.http.*; import java.io.*; import java.util.*;  public class InstanceVariableServlet extends HttpServlet{     int count=0;}                                                      274  Chapter 8  cid:2   Thread-Safe Servlets  F I G U R E 8 . 2  Clients share the instance      public void doGet HttpServletRequest req,                       HttpServletResponse res        throws ServletException, IOException {          res.setContentType "text plain" ;         PrintWriter out = res.getWriter  ;          count++;         out.println "Count = " + count ;     } The problem with utilizing instance variables is that when two threads  invoke the same servlet, they can corrupt each other’s data. Thread A could   value, thread  cause  B could gain access to the instance and cause   to increment to 2. After  control is returned to the first thread, the output will display 2 rather than  the correct value, 1.   to increment to 1, but before it prints the   count  count  count  Unlike local variables, instance variables are shared among all accessing   threads. See Figure 8.2.  Client thread 1  Client thread 2  Client thread 3  Client thread 4  t n u o c   t n  i  Servlet instance  To protect against data corruption, shared data must be accessed by only  one thread at a time. Solving this problem requires utilizing the lock associ- ated with the instance. By wrapping non-thread-safe code in a    synchronized code block, you force the requesting thread to acquire the instance lock in  order to gain access to the code block. For example:  synchronized this  {     count++;     out.println "Count = " + count ; }                                            Attributes  275  After a thread obtains the object’s lock, it accesses the synchronized code  block and holds on to the lock until exiting the code block. Other threads  attempting to enter the same block are forced to wait until the lock is relin- quished by the first thread—as seen in Figure 8.3.  F I G U R E 8 . 3  Accessing the instance in turns  Client thread 1  int count  Client thread 2  Client thread 3  Client thread 4  ZZzzz  ZZzzz  ZZzzz  Servlet instance  By synchronizing the instance variable data, you protect against another  thread corrupting shared data. However, from a stylistic point of view, there  are a few more concepts to consider. Synchronizing code can cause:  Reduction in performance   cid:2    cid:2    cid:2   Deadlock  Increased resource utilization  Blocking other threads comes with a price. While a thread waits for a lock,   it is inactive and not productive. The result is a reduction in performance.  Another consideration is the potential for deadlock. Sometimes locking  too much information can prevent the application from moving forward.  Consider a scenario with two threads: The first thread gains access to a  synchronized block and attempts to accomplish a task. A second thread  attempts to enter the same code block but is forced to wait because it lacks  the lock. The first thread, however, encounters a problem. It is unable to exe- cute code because it is waiting on results from the second thread—and the  second thread can’t provide any results because it is waiting for the lock to  be relinquished. Ultimately, both threads are at a standstill. To minimize the  possibility of deadlock, you should synchronize only that code absolutely  requiring protection. In the preceding example, there is really no need to  include the  count risk of causing a code freeze, pulling the  synchronized block increases the application’s efficiency rate.   statement in the block; only code that modifies the   variable needs to be synchronized. Although this example was not at   statement out of the   println …   println …                                       276  Chapter 8  cid:2   Thread-Safe Servlets  The final issue concerning locks is the overhead required to transfer the  lock between object and thread. Again, utilizing resources to swap objects  between threads can slow down the application or server.  Listing 8.3 shows how to prevent data corruption and keep perfor-  mance high.  Listing 8.3: Using the Instance Variable Safely   import javax.servlet.*; import javax.servlet.http.*; import java.io.*; import java.util.*;  public class InstanceVariableServlet extends HttpServlet{     int count=0;      public void doGet HttpServletRequest req,                       HttpServletResponse res        throws ServletException, IOException {  synchronized this  {          res.setContentType "text plain" ;         PrintWriter out = res.getWriter  ;                               count++;          }         out.println "Count = " + count ;     } } This solution works best if there is a need to protect shared data. Another  option is to make the variable  . This means the variable is final  and cannot change. Without the ability for change, there is no chance of  corrupting the value. Of course, this option wouldn’t work in this scenario,  but it is another consideration.  immutable  In summary, instance variables are not considered thread-safe and should  be avoided if possible. If utilizing an instance variable is unavoidable, then  sensitive code should be carefully synchronized to prevent multiple threads  from distorting the data.                                                   Attributes  277  Class Variables  , or static variables, are shared among all instances of a serv- Class variables let. It is a misconception to think a server will create only one instance of  a particular servlet. The truth is, the server can create a new instance of the  same servlet for each registered name defined. Within the   file, a  single servlet can be registered under multiple names. The following code  demonstrates how this is done:  web.xml               First         ClassVariableServlet                 Second         ClassVariableServlet                 Third         ClassVariableServlet        ClassVariableServlet , or     Notice the  ,  First Second referenced name if necessary. Consequently, any class or static variable  defined in the  ClassVariableServlet is shared among all instances. List- ing 8.4 demonstrates how the servlet monitors the number of instances and  how its variables are affected.  . The server can, in fact, create an instance for each    can be referenced by the name   Third  Listing 8.4: Using Class Variables  import javax.servlet.*; import javax.servlet.http.*; import java.util.*; import java.io.*;   278 Chapter 8  cid:2  Thread-Safe Servlets  public class ClassVariableServlet extends HttpServlet{     int count;    static HashMap instances = new HashMap  ;    static int classCount;    public void doGet HttpServletRequest req,                     HttpServletResponse res      throws ServletException, IOException {       res.setContentType "text plain" ;       PrintWriter out = res.getWriter  ;        count++;       out.println "Since loading, the “ +            req.getServletPath   +            “ instance has been accessed " +           count + " times." ;        instances.put this, this ;       out.println "There are currently " +           instances.size   + " instances." ;        classCount++;       out.println "Across all instances, the " +                   "ClassVariableServlet class has been " +                   "accessed " + classCount + "times." ;   } } This code is made up of three important parts. The first is an instance vari- able that is monitored and incremented by each reference or instance. The  second part is a java.util.HashMap used to count the number of instances  maintained by the server. Each reference is added by using the put …  method,  and duplicates are ignored. The final important piece is the class variable called  classCount. It measures the number of times the ClassVariableServlet  is accessed among all instances.  The output generated from this servlet will differ with each request, and  as each instance is created and accessed. The first time this servlet is run, it    Attributes 279  will have been accessed once with only one instance created. However, if the  servlet is reloaded, the result shown in Figure 8.4 will occur.  F I G U R E 8 . 4 A single instance  When the browser reloads the servlet, the doGet …  method is accessed  again, causing both instance and class variables to increment. Notice that a  reload does not cause a new instance to be created. You can expect the same  behavior if another thread accesses the  servlet First servlet.  Now let’s consider a different scenario. If a new thread attempts to access  the same servlet but uses the reference  servlet Second, the output shown  in Figure 8.5 will result.  F I G U R E 8 . 5 A second instance  The server creates a new instance of the ClassVariableServlet and its  instance variable is accessed only once. The variable classCount, however,  is accessed for a third time: first when  servlet First was accessed, then  on its reload, and now by  servlet Second.   280 Chapter 8  cid:2  Thread-Safe Servlets  Our final image drives home the difference between an instance versus   class variable. Figure 8.6 shows how a third thread accessing  servlet  Third causes the values to change.  F I G U R E 8 . 6 The third instance  Once again, a new instance is created. While the instance variable is  accessed for the first time, the class variable has now been incremented  four times.  For each registered name, a servlet can have unique init parameters.  Consequently, multiple instances of the same servlet can have different  initialization attributes.  Now that we have established how class variables work, we can focus  on how the class and instance variables behave when accessed by multiple  threads. Basically, class or static variables are shared among all instances  of the servlet, which makes them vulnerable to threading issues. In a multi- threaded application, static and instance variables behave quite similarly.  Both allow multiple users to access the data simultaneously. If a method  alters either variable type and is accessed by one thread, a second thread  could call that same or a different method, altering the variable simulta- neously. The end result is a corrupt value.  The solution to class variable threading issues is the same as the one used  for instance variables: simply synchronize critical data or make the variables  immutable. These actions can protect against problems generated from mul- tiple access.   Request Attributes  Attributes 281  When a servlet attempts to use another servlet to process part or all of a  response, a RequestDispatcher is used. The originating servlet sends both  the request and response to the target servlet for further execution. However,  prior to transmission, objects can be associated with the request. These objects  are called request attributes. The setAttribute String name, Object obj   method of the ServletRequest interface allows additional information to be  associated with the request object. Once the request object contains all its nec- essary information, one of the following methods of the RequestDispatcher  interface is invoked to transfer part or all of the control to the target servlet:  The forward ...  method The forward HttpServletRequest req,  HttpServletResponse resp  method causes the servlet engine to  “forward” control of the HTTP request internally from your current  servlet to another servlet or JSP or static file. The target resource is respon- sible for generating or delivering the response.  The include ...  method The include HttpServletRequest req,  HttpServletResponse resp  method means you include the result of  another resource, such as a servlet, JSP, or HTML page, inside the  response. The calling servlet then regains control of the response for  further modifications.  For a detailed discussion on the RequestDispatcher, refer to Chapter 2, “The  Servlet Model.”  Manually handling servlet-to-servlet communication would be a   difficult task to manage, especially in a multithreaded environment. The  RequestDispatcher object is designed to streamline the process and  ensure that concurrency problems do not occur. Listing 8.5 shows a basic  servlet dispatching a request to another servlet called TargetServlet.  Listing 8.5: A Simple RequestDispatcher Servlet  import javax.servlet.*; import javax.servlet.http.*; import java.io.*; import java.util.*; import javax.swing.*;   282 Chapter 8  cid:2  Thread-Safe Servlets  public class CallingServlet extends HttpServlet {      public void doGet HttpServletRequest req,                       HttpServletResponse res        throws ServletException, IOException {                  ImageIcon icon =              ImageIcon req.getParameter “icon” ;          req.setAttribute “logo”, icon ;         String display = “ servlet TargetServlet”;         RequestDispatcher dispatcher =             req.getRequestDispatcher display ;         dispatcher.forward req, res ;     } } In this example, the calling thread begins by requesting an icon defined  within the web.xml file. Remember, the return value can actually differ  depending on the reference name mapped to this servlet instance. After  the icon is obtained, it is associated with the request object by using the  setAttribute …  method. The path for the target servlet is then defined  and must be relative to the servlet context for the application. A  RequestDispatcher to the TargetServlet is acquired. Finally, both  request and response objects are forwarded to the target source.  To dispatch a request to a resource outside the current servlet context, you  must use the ServletContext.getRequestDispatcher String path  method.  Control is returned to the calling thread when using the forward …  or   include …  method; however, with the forward …  method, no further  modifications to the response can be made.  With a basic understanding of how the RequestDispatcher transfers   control to another servlet, the fundamental question of whether its request  attributes are thread-safe must be answered. Amidst the chaos of request dis- patching, the request attributes are actually thread-safe. The imagery of  control transferring between multiple servlets, while multiple threads are  accessing the original caller, might seem confusing; however, some funda- mental rules prevent problems from occurring in this environment.   Attributes 283  The logic rests on two critical points:   cid:2  Dispatched requests must run in the same:   cid:2  Servlet engine   cid:2  JVM   cid:2  Thread  single JVM.   cid:2  Dispatcher parameter values are not shared among threads within a   The container creates the RequestDispatcher object to wrap around the   target servlet  or another server resource . This dispatcher must run within  the same servlet engine, JVM, and thread as the target servlet. Conse- quently, the RequestDispatcher oversees and manages the transfer of control. When dispatched, a single thread moves between the source and the target   servlet. Because the attributes are linked to the request object, a second  thread accessing the dispatcher code will be assigned its own thread and  cannot affect the attributes of first dispatched thread.   The second point builds on the first: request parameters are not shared.  Each request dispatch causes the calling thread to separately store its set of  request attributes on the heap. Consequently, if one thread modifies its  attributes, it will not affect other dispatch threads.  Ultimately, the RequestDispatcher ensures that the integrity of the data   will not be compromised. Figure 8.7 demonstrates the process.   RequestDispatcher  req, res  Servlet A  req, res  Servlet B  The RequestDispatcher acts like a traffic manager in a multithreaded  world. It routes traffic from point A to point B while making sure no colli- sions occur. Without the dispatcher, it would be difficult to avoid concur- rency problems as parameters are passed between servlets. Because request  attributes are designed for utilization with the RequestDispatcher, you can  be assured they are thread-safe.  F I G U R E 8 . 7 Thread-safe request parameters   284 Chapter 8  cid:2  Thread-Safe Servlets  Session Attributes  When a user accesses an application, their short-term data can be tracked by  using a session object. The object is comprised of temporary client informa- tion referred to as session attributes. A session begins when the developer cre- ates an HttpSession object for the client. That can happen when the client  visits the first or subsequent pages of the application. The session ends either  when the developer terminates their access, or after an elapsed time period.  Because a session is created by the container and associated with each client  through its request object, threading is handled internally and is quite safe.  A servlet uses the HttpServletRequest method getSession   to retrieve   the current session. That value should be stored in a local variable to avoid  concurrency issues. After the session object is obtained, the servlet uses the  setAttribute String name, Object obj  method of the HttpSession  interface to store client information, and the getAttribute String name   method to retrieve data. Listing 8.6 shows how a servlet sets client attributes  to the session.  Listing 8.6: Using Session Attributes  import javax.servlet.*; import javax.servlet.http.*; import java.io.*; import java.util.*;  public class SessionServlet extends HttpServlet {      public void doGet HttpServletRequest req,                       HttpServletResponse res        throws ServletException, IOException {          HttpSession session = req.getSession  ;         session.setAttribute "userName",           req.getRemoteUser   ;          res.setContentType "text plain" ;         PrintWriter out = res.getWriter  ;         out.println "Welcome " +            session.getAttribute "userName"  ;    } }   Attributes 285  The session is retrieved dynamically from the current request object.   Because of Java’s design, you are guaranteed that the request parameter is  directly threaded to the current client. As a result, the session returned is also  the session associated with the client accessing this code. Any attributes  added or acquired fall under the same category and are thread-safe. Once the  variable is local to a method, there is no threat of data corruption from inter- cepting threads due to local variable threading rules. Figure 8.8 provides a  visual representation of how session objects and their attributes are linked  directly to the client thread.  F I G U R E 8 . 8 Sessions linked to the client  Client thread 1  Session A  Client thread 2  Session B  Client thread 3  Session C  Client thread 4  Session D  Servlet instance  Fundamentally, each client operates on its own session object. By design,   adding session attributes is thread-safe.  Context Attributes  As discussed in Chapter 2, the ServletContext is an object that provides  global data to an entire application. This global data is referred to as con- text attributes. If a servlet needs to acquire the port number used to access  the main database, it would invoke the getServletContext   method  to first get a handle to the application’s context. It then would call the  getAttribute String name  method, using the key name, to return  the desired port number. Attributes are most commonly defined within the  deployment descriptor, as shown in the following code snippet:                               driver   286 Chapter 8  cid:2  Thread-Safe Servlets                                  oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver                                databaseProtocol                                 jdbc:oracle:  dbServer1:1521                     …   Defined before other resources, the context parameters are shared by   all servlets and JSPs within the web application. Generally, servlets use the  ServletContext’s getAttribute …  method to read context data, and  rarely use the setAttribute …  method to define the values. Listing 8.7  displays a basic servlet using the ServletContext to retrieve a context  attribute for the database driver needed to establish a database connection.  Listing 8.7: Using Context Attributes  import javax.servlet.*; import javax.servlet.http.*; import java.io.*; import java.util.*; import java.sql.*;  public class ContextServlet extends HttpServlet {      public void doGet HttpServletRequest req,                       HttpServletResponse res        throws ServletException, IOException {          res.setContentType "text plain" ;         PrintWriter out = res.getWriter  ;   Single-Threaded Servlets 287          ServletContext context = getServletContext  ;         String driver =              String context.getAttribute “driver” ;         try {             Class.forName driver ;             Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection                 context.getAttribute “databaseProtocol”  +                “CustomerListDB” ;             …         } catch  ClassNotFoundException e  {             out.println “Unable to load driver” ;         } catch  SQLException e  {                     out.println e.getMessage   ;         }    } } This code demonstrates the use of context attributes in a simple way.   How threads are handled is another story. Because all application resources  have access to the data within a context, a modification made by one thread  will affect all other threads. If thread A calls setAttribute …  and changes  the value of the driver attribute, thread B will access the new driver when  getAttribute “driver”  is called. This does not mean that context  attributes are not thread-safe, because the behavior is expected and normal.  Problems arise if during the implementation of the setAttribute …  method,  another thread calls setAttribute …  on the same name. If the method  setAttribute …  is not synchronized, there is potential for concurrency  problems. Most server applications offer this feature; however, it is not man- dated, nor is it guaranteed.  So in summary, we can say context attributes are fairly thread-safe,   because they are usually set in the web.xml file and most servers do synchro- nize the setAttribute …  method.  Single-Threaded Servlets  One solution to preventing threading problems within servlets is to   limit the number of threads that can access a single servlet to one. This can be    288 Chapter 8  cid:2  Thread-Safe Servlets  done by having the servlet implement the SingleThreadModel interface. There  are no methods that must be implemented. Instead, the interface is used as a  flag to notify the container how to handle the servlet life cycle. As per the API  specifications, a servlet that implements the SingleThreadModel is “guaran- teed” to allow only one thread access to the service   method at a time. This  guarantee is achieved by the container either synchronizing access to the single  servlet instance or maintaining a pool of servlet instances. The latter approach  is more common. Containers can be configured to create multiple servlet  instances per a single registered name. Figure 8.9 shows this graphically.   F I G U R E 8 . 9 How the SingleThreadModel affects instances  Standard servlet  Servlet instance  Registered name  SingleThreadModel servlet  Registered name  Servlet instance  Servlet instance  Servlet instance  Servlet instance  Servlet instance  As a request comes in, the container provides an available instance from  the pool. When resources run out, the container can either make the current  thread wait or produce another instance. The benefit of this model is that  each thread has access to its own instance variables for the servlet. This  means instance variables are now thread-safe without the need to synchro- nize. One problem solved.  Unfortunately, threading issues extend beyond instance variables. Class  variables are not protected by the SingleThreadModel interface. Because  class variables are shared among all instances, including those registered by  the same name, a method that changes their value can cause data corrup- tion. Imagine the following scenario. Thread A begins by using its personal  instance to access the doGet …  method. The doGet …  method makes a    Single versus Multithreaded Servlets 289  change to a class variable. If thread B comes into the picture, it also uses its  own instance to call the same doGet …  method. Both threads could mod- ify the class variable and cause the other to work using an inaccurate value.  Figure 8.10 clarifies the process.  F I G U R E 8 . 1 0 Class variables with the SingleThreadModel  Client thread  Client thread  Client thread  Servlet instance  Servlet instance  Servlet instance  doGet …  {   classVariable++;   out.println classVariable ; }  The image shows three instances accessing the same class variable. Imple- menting the SingleThreadModel interface fails to solve threading problems  with class variables. The solution? Synchronization.  Although the SingleThreadModel seems to be the fast and easy solution,  it is not encouraged practice. The interface manages to make a single servlet  thread-safe, but fails to apply that to the entire system. A positive and a neg- ative still result in a negative. The encouraged alternatives are to synchronize  methods or use external resource pools.  Single versus Multithreaded Servlets  When one thread accesses a Java class, there is little concern for   corruption. Servlets, however, are different. By design, even single-threaded  servlets can provide room for data errors. Generally, a container will create  an instance of the servlet by calling its constructor and init   method. The  servlet will then persist until additional requests are made. With the imple- mentation of the SingleThreadModel interface, each request will either  wait in turn to access the instance’s service …  method or get its own  unique instance of the registered servlet. Instance variables are protected, but  shared resources are still not thread-safe.   290 Chapter 8  cid:2  Thread-Safe Servlets  Multithreaded servlets must use synchronized blocks to protect data that   can be concurrently accessed. In summary, Table 8.2 identifies the differ- ences between single-threaded and multithreaded servlets.  T A B L E 8 . 2 Thread-safe?   Data Element  Normally Thread-safe?

Each course is designed to have a maximum of 100 students  enrolled at a time. Although the majority of each class will consist of static  pages containing information, the application must also provide testing,  discussion, and homework areas. These areas will be designed by using  servlets and will also be accessible to all students.   The problem is that multiple students can access a servlet, for example, the  TestServlet, and corrupt other students’ access. To avoid creating a mess,  there are two solutions. The first is to have the servlet implement the  SingleThreadModel interface. Given the server used, this option will cause  the container to create a pool of instances. This approach ensures that each  student uses their own servlet instance, with its own instance variables to  process the exam. The second option is to process the servlet in its normal    Summary  Exam Essentials 291  state and define the students’ answers as session attributes. The downside  of this approach is that if the student leaves their system for an extended  period of time, the session will time out—and they will need to start over.  There are many ways to solve a problem. Depending on the server’s capa- bilities and performance issues, one approach will outweigh another.  In this chapter, we discussed the various threading issues associated   with a variety of data elements. When multiple threads access a servlet, its  instance and class variables are vulnerable to corruption. Local variable  and method parameters are safe due to the design of the JVM. To protect  data against possible corruption, synchronized code blocks can be placed  around calls to modify the data. By forcing threads to obtain the object’s  lock for access, you prevent multiple threads from simultaneously altering  critical data.  Another solution to threading issues is to have the servlet implement the   SingleThreadModel interface. As discussed in this chapter, this can solve some  of the problems, but can still leave you with the need to synchronize shared  data. The other option is to make variables immutable. It’s one solution, but  not practical.  In conclusion, the following suggestions can be made: In place of instance   variables, session attributes provide a safer way to handle data in a multi- threaded environment. If applicable, context attributes provide more thread  safety than class variables.  Exam Essentials  Be able to identify which of the following attributes are thread-safe: local  variables, instance variables, class variables, request attributes, session  attributes, and context attributes. It is important to know how each  variable and attribute is affected by multiple client access. Instance and  class variables are especially prone to concurrency issues. Local variables  and session request attributes are thread-safe. Context attributes can be  corrupted, but their design makes that unlikely.    292 Chapter 8  cid:2  Thread-Safe Servlets  Be able to identify correct statements about the differences between  multithreaded and single-threaded servlet models. The multithreaded  model allows more than one client request to access a single instance. If  variables are synchronized, concurrency problems can be avoided. The  single-threaded model is designed to have only one request access an  instance at a time. Although this seems to solve all threading problems, it  doesn’t. Synchronization is still necessary on certain variables or attributes.  Be able to identify the interface used to declare that a servlet must use the  single-thread model. The SingleThreadModel interface guarantees a  request will access its own servlet instance. Although this option offers  some thread safety, it does not protect the entire application from thread- ing issues.

Class variables are defined by using the static keyword and are   located under the class definition.  2. A.  Local variables are placed on the stack. Because each thread is   provided its own stack, there is no chance for another thread to access  this value.  3. A.  Synchronizing large blocks of code should be avoided to protect  against performance hits. Consequently, only shared data should be  locked. As for making all instance and class variables immutable, well,  that isn’t always a feasible option.  4. B.  The RequestDispatcher manages requests that are sent to other  server resources. Each request can be comprised of additional objects  defined as request attributes.  5. A.  Request attributes are linked to the request object and managed   by the RequestDispatcher. The dispatcher, on the other hand, is  linked to the servlet context.  6. B.  Synchronized blocks are created by developers to prevent thread- ing issues. The other options can result from multiple threads accessing  the same servlet.  7. A.  A thread must obtain the object’s lock to read synchronized code  blocks. After the lock is held by one thread, all others must wait until  the lock is relinquished—this occurs when the original thread exits the  synchronized code block. Finally, you cannot synchronize parameters.  8. C.  A session object is created when a client first accesses a web site.  During the life of the session, data is added and will continue to persist  for the life of the current user or if the session times out.  9. D.  The SingleThreadModel interface is a flag interface with no   methods. It is used by the container to determine the type of life cycle  for the servlet.  10. B, C.  Both local variables and method parameters are stored on the  Java stack. Each request is provided its own stack to prevent threading  problems. Instance variables are stored in the heap, which is shared by  all threads. Finally, class variables are stored in the method area, mak- ing them accessible by all threads as well.   298 Chapter 8  cid:2  Thread-Safe Servlets  11. A, C, D.  If code is not synchronized correctly, negative effects can   result. Performance can decline, resource utilization can increase, and  threads can freeze. Threads, however, will not terminate.  12. B.  The first option is incorrect because a container usually creates   one instance per registered name. The third option is inaccurate  because a container can create more than one instance per registered  name if the servlet implements the SingleThreadModel. Finally,  pooling is, in fact, an option when the SingleThreadModel interface  is implemented. This leaves the second option. When a request is sent  to the container, it is up to the container to provide a servlet instance to  the requesting thread.  13. A.  The RequestDispatcher object can be obtained in two ways.   One way is through the Request object, and the other is through the  ServletContext object. Consequently it is not tightly coupled with  the request object.  14. C, D.  There is a setAttribute String name, Object obj    method within the ServletContext class. Although it isn’t used  much, it is still available. Because context attributes are shared by all  threads, modifications to their values can require synchronization if  the setAttribute method is not synchronized.  15. B.  The API states   “If a servlet implements this interface, you are guaranteed  that no two threads will execute concurrently in the servlet’s  service.”  Basically, the server can either synchronize the service …  method  for that one instance, or it can create a pool of instances and allocate  a handle when a request is made. Although the third option is a  possibility, it is not guaranteed.

One of the goals of the J2EE model is to have each task or   role handled separately. By eliminating dependencies, each component  becomes reusable, extensible, and manageable. This same philosophy carries  over to the Java Server Page  JSP  model. Generally speaking, the Internet’s  history began with a scripting language called Common Gateway Interface,  more commonly known as CGI. CGI provided client-server communication  but failed to efficiently handle security, multithreading issues, extensibility,  logging capabilities and other enterprise-related features. This opened the  door to servlet technology. Servlets replaced CGI by using Java technology  to communicate between the client and application. A servlet intercepts a  browser request and executes it on the server by mixing dynamic content  with static content generated by HTML. Although servlets provide a Java  solution to communication, they still closely link Java and HTML code.  JSPs, on the other hand, provide a solution to this level of dependency.  As per the JSP specification, JSPs “enable the separation of dynamic and  static content.” Because JSPs are built on top of servlets, they focus on the  presentation while the servlet focuses on the content. In this chapter, we  will discuss the design behind this technology and how to implement  it correctly.  The JSP Model  To be a first-rate servlet developer, you must be a strong Java pro-  grammer. In addition, you should also have decent HTML and design skills  to generate elegant graphical responses. In an ideal world, people could  accomplish both tasks with proficiency. In a realistic world, however,    302 Chapter 9  cid:2  Java Server Pages  JSPs   those who develop the front end, or Presentation layer, are strong in graph- ical design and are in a separate group from business logic programmers  who develop the middle or back end of an application. This fact makes  superior servlet development difficult. The solution to this predicament is  to add another technology to servlets to help share the task. This design  is known as the JSP model. Unlike servlet developers, a good JSP developer  simply needs to be strong in design and front-end development. The need  to know Java can be left to the servlet programmer. By separating the  design developer from the Java developer, you enable a single individual to  master the Presentation layer while another masters the middle, or Business  Logic, layer.   The JSP model relies on two main objectives. The first is to allow and   encourage the separation of the Presentation layer from Java code. The  second objective is to enable developers to author web pages that have  dynamic content, with maximum power and flexibility. By mere design,  the second objective is met. As for the first, well, it is still possible to  include Java code inside JSP files. The “separation” is encouraged and pos- sible, but not mandatory. Figure 9.1 illustrates how the priorities of each  technology differ.  F I G U R E 9 . 1 Servlet design versus JSP design  Servlet  Java  HTML  JSP  HTML  Java  A servlet is Java code with HTML embedded within, whereas a JSP is   HTML code with embedded Java. Creating an inverse model enables each  developer to focus on their own area of expertise. Let’s compare the code  necessary to generate a “Hello World!” greeting by using a servlet versus  a JSP; see Figure 9.2.  Figure 9.2 proves a developer needs to fully understand Java to write a  servlet, whereas a JSP developer’s strength is in HTML. Both files generate  the same output; “Hello World!” will appear in the top-left corner of the  browser. To ensure this result, all JSP pages must be saved by using the .jsp  extension. In addition, the file  that is, hello.jsp  must be placed in either  the server’s document root or the application’s context path.   The JSP Model 303  hello.jsp            Hello World!        F I G U R E 9 . 2 Servlet code versus JSP code  HelloServlet.java  import javax.servlet.*; import javax.servlet.http.*; import java.util.*;  public class HelloServlet extends HttpServlet {    public void doGet HttpServletRequest req,                      HttpServletResponse res      throws ServletException, IOException {        res.setContentType “text html” ;        PrintWriter out = res.getWriter         out.println “ ” ;       out.println “ ” ;       out.println "Hello World!" ;       outprintln “ ” ;       outprintln “ ” ;     } }  The naming standard for JSP pages suggests that all filenames should be  identified with an initial lowercase letter.   Most vendors who support servlets also provide JSP support. The refer-  ence implementation for JSPs is called Jasper. It is embedded within the  Tomcat server. Next, we will discuss how JSPs work.  JSP Life Cycle  The first time a client makes a request, the JSP engine captures the request  and loads the appropriate .jsp page. It then creates a special servlet from  the Java Server Page to execute the page’s content. Listing 9.1 shows the  wrapper class source code generated by an Apache server to execute the  hello.jsp page.  The actual code may very among servers.   Listing 9.1: JSP to Servlet Code for hello.jsp  import javax.servlet.*; import javax.servlet.http.*; import javax.servlet.jsp.*;   304 Chapter 9  cid:2  Java Server Pages  JSPs   import org.apache.jasper.runtime.*;  public class hello$jsp extends HttpJspBase {    static {}   public hello$jsp    {}    private static boolean _jspx_inited = false;    public final void _jspx_init        throws org.apache.jasper.runtime.JspException {}    public void _jspService HttpServletRequest request,                           HttpServletResponse  response      throws java.io.IOException, ServletException {      JspFactory _jspxFactory = null;     PageContext pageContext = null;     HttpSession session = null;     ServletContext application = null;     ServletConfig config = null;     JspWriter out = null;     Object page = this;     String  _value = null;      try {       if  _jspx_inited == false  {         synchronized  this  {           if  _jspx_inited == false  {             _jspx_init  ;             _jspx_inited = true;           }         }     }    _jspxFactory = JspFactory.getDefaultFactory  ;     response.setContentType        "text html;charset=ISO-8859-1" ;   The JSP Model 305      pageContext =       jspxFactory.getPageContext          this, request, response,"", true, 8192, true ;     application = pageContext.getServletContext  ;     config = pageContext.getServletConfig  ;     session = pageContext.getSession  ;     out = pageContext.getOut  ;         HTML    begin  [file=" jsp checkbox checkresult.jsp"from= 0,0 ;to= 7,0 ]     out.write " \r\n \r\n     Hello World!\r\n \r\n \r\n" ;        end      } catch  Throwable t  {        if  out != null && out.getBufferSize   != 0             out.clearBuffer  ;        if  pageContext != null             pageContext.handlePageException t ;     } finally {        if  _jspxFactory != null            _jspxFactory.releasePageContext pageContext ;     }   } } As you can see, the JSP engine dynamically generates all the necessary servlet  logic to provide functionality for the Presentation layer. The “Hello World!”  string is written to the output stream defined within the service method.   Later, when we discuss implicit objects  bold objects within the code , you  might want to refer back to this example to see exactly where and how these  variables are defined.  A fundamental servlet rule is that all servlets must implement the javax .servlet.Servlet interface. Standard servlets extend javax.servlet.http .HttpServlet, which indirectly inherits from the javax.servlet.Servlet  interface. A servlet converted from a JSP must follow the same directive. The    306 Chapter 9  cid:2  Java Server Pages  JSPs   difference, however, is that the extending class is a container-specific imple- mentation. Figure 9.3 diagrams the inheritance hierarchy.   F I G U R E 9 . 3 Servlet inheritance hierarchy  javax.servlet.Servlet  interface   javax.servlet.jsp.JspPage  interface   javax.servlet.GenericServlet  interface   javax.servlet.jsp.HttpJspPage  interface   javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet  class   JSP to servlet  Servlet  All servlets converted from a JSP must utilize the javax.servlet.jsp  .JspPage interface. It contains two important methods:  void jspInit   is invoked when the first request is made to initialize  the JSP.  void jspDestroy   is invoked by the container to clean up resources— for example, when the container shuts down, or when the generated  servlet is unloaded from memory.   To provide additional functionality, a declaration can be used to override both  these methods within the JSP. Declarations are covered in the next section,  “JSP Elements.”   Next, let’s look at the interface javax.servlet.jsp.HttpJspPage. It   adds the most important method:  void _jspService HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse  response  throws ServletException, IOException captures every  JSP request.  The _jspService …  method is to the JSP as the  service …  method is to the servlet.   The implementation for this method is generated by the container and should  not be overridden.   F I G U R E 9 . 4 JSP life cycle  The JSP Model 307  The servlet produced is stored on the server for future needs. Initially, the   first client who accesses the JSP page will experience a delay, known as  the first-person penalty. This delay results from the time required to generate  and compile  or translate  the JSP into a servlet. Figure 9.4 illustrates the life- cycle process.  First request  JSP  JSP Other JSPs  JSP  Browser  Response  Translated  Future requests  Servlet  Specifically, a JSP goes through the following process before it can be uti- lized: When a client first makes a request for a JSP, the container determines  whether one currently exists. The container uses an internal list that maps  the name of each .jsp page with its compiled .class file. If a reference does  not exist, the .jsp page is translated to Java servlet code and a .java file is  created. The container then compiles the code, generating a .class file, and  loads it into memory. An instance is created, and then the servlet’s init    method is invoked. At that point, the _jspService …  method is next in  line. The request and response is passed to the _jspService …  method and  eventually to the correct doXXX   method.  If a servlet for the JSP already exists, the container will determine whether  the page needs to be regenerated or recompiled. Based on server settings, the  container might regenerate the JSP if a timeout occurred since the last gen- eration. A time-stamp change to the JSP page will also cause an update to the  servlet.  Finally, if the server decides to discard the generated servlet, it calls the  servlet’s destroy   method, which drops the reference to the servlet and  sets it up for garbage collection.  The process is as follows:  1. Translate the page  .jsp to .java .  2. Compile the JSP page  .java to .class .  3. Load the class.   4. Create the instance.   5. Call jspInit   when the page is first initialized.   308 Chapter 9  cid:2  Java Server Pages  JSPs   JSP Elements  6. ∗Call_jspService …  for every request made to the JSP. 7. Call jspDestroy   when the JSP is destroyed by the server. ∗All future requests are serviced by the servlet  assuming no changes are   made to the JSP .   Now that you understand the general ideas and life cycle behind Java   Server Pages, we will focus on the rules and semantics associated with build- ing these powerful pages.  A JSP page is made up of a variety of tags and elements. Some ele-  ments help include pieces of Java code, while others transfer control to  another object to carry out an intended task. In this section, we will cover  acceptable scriptlet techniques used to incorporate Java expressions, variables,  methods, code blocks, or conditional statements within a JSP page. Again,  the JSP page places priority on web design by making HTML the primary  focus, but it still allows the use of Java code in a scripting format. It is a  feature and available, but not always encouraged.   Values assigned to JSP elements are case sensitive.   This section covers the following element types:   cid:2  Hidden comment   cid:2  Declaration   cid:2  Expression   cid:2  Scriptlet   cid:2  Directive  Hidden Comment  A hidden comment identifies text that should be ignored by the JSP con- tainer. Hidden comments are usually used to explain behavior or to  comment out JSP code.   JSP Elements 309  JSP Syntax    XML Syntax  None  Example      A Comment Example      Sample Comments         Text written within hidden tags is not included in the response body.   Instead, the information is used to help the developer understand and utilize  the source code more effectively.  Declaration  A declaration declares Java variables or methods that future Java code can  access within the JSP page.   JSP Syntax    Example  <%! int k=0;      int a, b, c;      Color redColor = new Color 255, 0, 0 ;      private static final String MESSAGE=“Hello”;           public String getMessage   {         return MESSAGE;     }  %>   310 Chapter 9  cid:2  Java Server Pages  JSPs   XML Syntax       declaration; [declaration;]+ …   Example       int k=0;     int a, b, c;    Color redColor = new Color 255, 0, 0 ;      private static final String MESSAGE=“Hello”;          public String getMessage   {        return MESSAGE;    }    Any declaration that is valid within the Java programming language is  valid within the declaration JSP elements. This includes multiple declara- tions as well as variable declarations combined with method declarations.  The use of the static keyword has the same effect as declaring a static vari- able in a Java class—the value is shared by all instances of the class. On a  more general note, you must first declare a variable before using it in future  code snippets or scriptlet code  we will discuss the latter shortly, under  “Scriptlets” .  Consider the following rules when writing declarations:   cid:2  You can declare static or instance variables, new methods, or inner   classes.   cid:2  Each variable declaration must end with a semicolon.   cid:2  Variables and methods available through import statements are acces-  sible without requiring additional declarations.   cid:2  After declaring a variable or method, the information is available to   subsequent Java code.   cid:2  It usually contains code that would go outside the servlet’s   _jspService …  method.   JSP Elements 311  The methods jspInit   and jspDestroy   can be implemented within a dec- laration. These methods are called by the servlet’s init   and destroy    methods. The JSP, however, cannot override the servlet’s init   and  destroy   methods because they are declared final by the background servlet.  Expression  An expression is a valid statement of logic used within a JSP page. It indicates  a variable or method invocation whose resulting value is written to the  response output stream. Because all expressions are computed and converted  to String objects, they are most commonly used to provide dynamic String  information to the response body.  The file you accessed is    bytes in length. Your randomly selected number is:   . XML Syntax  JSP Syntax    Example       expression;    Example  The file you accessed is   array.length   bytes in length. Your randomly selected number is:    Math.round Math.random  *100   .  When an expression element is encountered, the expression itself is  1. Evaluated  2. Converted to a String object  3. Inserted into the response output stream   312 Chapter 9  cid:2  Java Server Pages  JSPs   The output generated from an expression is similar to the results that you   would receive from an out.println   statement.   Because Java code is now being used as a scripting language, there are a   few rules that apply. Consider the following:   cid:2  Expressions are generally not terminated with a semicolon.  Some   servers do not require a semicolon; others do .   cid:2  They are evaluated from left to right.   cid:2  They can be composed of more than one part or expression.  The ternary operator provides an example of how multiple expressions   can exist within a single expression: <%=  boolean evaluation  ?       true expression  :       false expression   %>  Scriptlet  A scriptlet is a code fragment used within a JSP page. It can consist of multiple  statements, made up of variable declarations, code blocks, and conditional  and iterative statements. Conditional statements consist of if, if else, and  switch blocks, and iterative statements are represented by for, while,  and do loops.  When a scriptlet is translated to the servlet, it is placed within the  _jspService …  method. Consequently, static blocks cannot be defined  within a scriptlet.  JSP Syntax    Example  <%   String rate = request.getParameter "taxRate" ;   int value;   try {     value = Integer.parseInt rate ;   JSP Elements 313  } catch  NullPointerException e  { %>     <% } %> XML Syntax       code fragment;    Example      String rate = request.getParameter "taxRate" ;   int value;   try {       value = Integer.parseInt rate ;   } catch  NullPointerException e  {        include file=“error.html”        }    The logic for a scriptlet is embedded within the body of the JSP servlet’s   _jspService …  method. This means the logic is executed with each  request. In addition, all implicit objects  which we will discuss in the upcom- ing section, “Implicit Objects”  are available to the scriptlet. If the scriptlet  generates output, it is buffered in the out  JspWriter’s  object, which is  then sent to the client.  Scriptlets provide a way to include fragmented Java code to help gener- ate a response. A scriptlet differs from a declaration in that the text can be  broken up into pieces. For example, an if block can be defined within a  scriptlet tag. Without completing the else block, you can insert a different  JSP tag to perform a particular behavior. You can then conclude the else    314 Chapter 9  cid:2  Java Server Pages  JSPs   Statements  block with a final scriptlet. Within the scriptlet, you can include the  following tag types:   cid:2  Declaration  variable, method, class    cid:2  Expression  valid variable or method invocation    cid:2  Any implicit or explicit object declared with a jsp:useBean element   cid:2  Any valid scripting language statement  Not only is it important for you to know what you can include within a  scriptlet, but the objectives require you to distinguish between correct and  incorrect iteration and conditional scriptlet code.  When writing either iteration or conditional statements within a scriptlet,  you should be concerned with two factors. The first is how curly braces are  handled, and the second is how code is interpreted within and outside the  scriptlet block.   The rules for using curly braces within a scriptlet are the same as those   used within a regular Java application.    cid:2  Conditional or iteration statements require braces if more than one   line of code within the body must be evaluated.    cid:2  Opening braces can appear on the statement’s declaration line or later.   cid:2  All opening braces must have a matching closing brace.  There is no difference between writing a conditional statement or an   iterative statement. The rules that apply are standard to the Java language.  When a JSP is precompiled, the server reads in the JSP and creates a servlet.  All scriptlet statements are placed within the servlet as is, without modifi- cation. Consequently, anything legal in a normal block is legal within a  scriptlet.  The following code demonstrates acceptable scriptlet code:         Life is great!       Life is tough.     But will get better.     JSP Elements 315  The code snippet translates to the following Java code: if true       out.println “Life is great!” ; else {      out.println “Life is tough.” ;     out.println “But will get better.” ; }  Text outside the scriptlet is automatically written to the output stream.  However, text within the scriptlet tags must be valid Java code. For example,  the following example fails:  <% for int i=0; i<5; i++ {       To be or not to be.   } %> An error is generated because a String cannot simply exist within a code   block. Utilizing the appropriate rules, the next example succeeds:    do something else     Any text or scriptlet code between the braces is part of the for loop and  will be evaluated the number of times specified within the for loop iteration  block. In the previous example, “do something else” will print five times,  along with the statement about the value of i.  Scriptlets are a quick and dirty way to provide functionality. Unfortu- nately they enable you to write sloppy code that obscures the distinction  between the presentation  HTML  and business logic  Java code . The rec- ommended alternative is to use JavaBeans or custom tags. They require  more work to write and access, but provide greater flexibility and clarity  with the code design. We will cover these topics later in this chapter and in  the next.  Directive   A directive enables a JSP page to control the overall structure for the trans- lation phase of the servlet. Directives provide global information independent  of a specific request. Some examples include incorporating classes or other    316 Chapter 9  cid:2  Java Server Pages  JSPs   files, and defining page characteristics. The three types of directives are  as follows:   cid:2  The include directive   cid:2  The page directive   cid:2  The taglib directive   We will discuss each directive in detail by describing its purpose and how   it is defined in JSP and XML syntax.  The include Directive  The include directive includes a static file in a JSP page.   JSP Syntax    XML Syntax    Example  include.jsp:      The quote for the day is:  “ ”      dailyQuote.jsp:  <%! public String generateQuote   {         String quote=null;            accesses file to get a quote         return quote;     }  %>    This code displays the following in the page: The quote for the day is: “Never regret.”   JSP Elements 317  The purpose of an include directive is to insert a file in a JSP page when  it is translated. The types of files consist of a JSP page, HTML file, XML doc- ument, or text file. The process of including a file in your current JSP page  is referred to as a static include. This means the text of the included file is  added to the JSP page. This process is somewhat literal—meaning a file that  contains interpretive tags, such as   , will be literally included  in the file.  The contents of the file specified with this directive are preprocessed, and the  resulting output is placed in the original JSP page. When the preprocessor  encounters any static text   …  , the preprocessor is supposed  to generate out.println “\r\n … ”  statements. The resulting  output is then captured by the compiler and inserted into the original  JSP page.  If the included file is a JSP page, the JSP elements are translated and   included in the JSP page. After the include file is translated, the translation  process continues with the original JSP.   A container can behave in different ways when handling include files.   Depending on the JSP container, you might expect:   cid:2  The JSP page to be recompiled if the include file changes    cid:2  The include file to be opened and available to all requests, or to have   security restrictions  The value for the file attribute is relative, which means the path consists   of the URL minus the protocol, port, and domain name. Some examples  include:    cid:2  error.jsp   cid:2  temp buyNow.html   cid:2   beans generateReceipt.jsp  When the relative path starts with a forward slash    , the path is relative  to the JSP application’s context. If the relative URL starts with a directory or  filename, the path is relative to the JSP page.  The page Directive  A page directive defines attributes that apply to an entire JSP page.    318 Chapter 9  cid:2  Java Server Pages  JSPs   JSP Syntax     A page directive is used to provide information to the JSP page. Conse- quently, many attribute values are used to define data for the page. Table 9.1  list all page directive attributes, their descriptions, and their default values.  T A B L E 9 . 1 page Directive Attributes   Attribute  Description  Default Value  language   extends  import  Defines the scripting language used in  scriptlets, declarations, and expressions  in the JSP page.  java Legal value for  the JSP 1.2 spec  Delineates the fully qualified name of  the superclass for the Java class in the  JSP page.  package.class  package.class package.* package.class,   package.class  Identifies the classes available to the  scriptlets, expressions, and declarations  in the JSP page. A comma is used to  separate the multiple imports. The fol- lowing packages are implicitly  imported: java.lang.* javax.servlet.* javax.servlet.jsp.* javax.servlet.http.*  Defines whether the client must join an  HTTP session to use the JSP page. true  refers to the current or new session,  whereas false indicates that you can- not use a session object, but you can  still use beans, as long as they are not  part of a session object.  session  true  buffer  Used by the out object to handle output  sent from the compiled JSP page to the  browser.  8kb   JSP Elements 319  T A B L E 9 . 1 page Directive Attributes  continued   Attribute  Description  autoFlush  Default Value  true  isThreadSafe  false  Indicates whether to automatically  flush the buffer after it is full. If set to  false, an exception will be thrown  when the buffer overflows. A false  value cannot be used when the buffer  is set to none.  Defines whether the JSP page is thread- safe. A true value means that concur- rent client requests to the JSP page will  not cause corruption. This is usually  done through synchronization within  the JSP page. A false value means the  container must send client requests one  at a time.  info  errorPage  Declares a text string accessible from  within the servlet.  Custom to the  container  Describes the pathname to the page  used to display error messages when  exceptions are raised.  relativeURL  isErrorPage  false  Defines whether the JSP page is an  error page. A true value allows the  exception object to be used within the  JSP page. A false value indicates that  you cannot use the exception object in  the JSP page.  contentType  Defines the MIME type and character  encoding that the JSP page uses for the  response.  text html;  charset=ISO- 8859-1  pageEncoding  Identifies the character encoding used  for the JSP response.  ISO-8859-1   320 Chapter 9  cid:2  Java Server Pages  JSPs   Example      XML Syntax  <jsp:directive.page pageDirectiveAttribute [+       pageDirectiveAttribute]  > Example  <jsp:directive.page errorPage=“error.jsp”        extends=“java.awt.Color” isThreadSafe=“true”  >  The attributes apply to the entire JSP page and any static include files.   The combination of the two is referred to as a translation unit.   The following rules apply to the page directive:   cid:2  You can use the page directive more than once in a translation unit.   cid:2  You can use a page attribute only once in a translation unit, except for   import.  The import statement operates similarly to Java code.    cid:2  A page directive can be placed anywhere within the JSP page   or included files.  It is good practice to place it at the top of the  JSP page.   The taglib Directive  A taglib directive defines a tag library and prefix for the custom tags used in  the JSP page.  JSP Syntax    Example  <%@ taglib uri=“http:  www.company.com tags”      prefix=“public” %>   …   XML Syntax  None   JSP Elements 321  The taglib directive enables custom tags to be included in a JSP page. The  first attribute defines the tag library, whereas the second specifies the tag pre- fix. The taglib must be defined before the use of a custom tag. Although there  can be more than one taglib directive defined, the prefix must be unique.  There are two attributes to consider. The Uniform Resource Identifier, or   uri, describes the set of custom tags associated with the prefix tag. The  prefix is the name that precedes the custom tag name. Empty prefixes are  illegal, and the following prefixes cannot be used because they are reserved  by Sun Microsystems: jsp, jspx, java, javax, servlet, sun, and sunw.  Knowing the different attributes and syntax rules related to the four types   of scripting tags can be a bit confusing. Table 9.2 organizes each tag and  identifies its major features.

In addition, you must understand  the purpose of each and how it is used.  Java code embedded within a JSP tag has access to many of the same   objects available to a servlet. These are referred to as implicit objects. Some  examples include the HttpSerlvetRequest object, known as request, or  the ServletContext, known as application. Currently the container pro- vides nine predefined variables with specified names that JSP-embedded Java  can utilize. In this section, we will cover each predefined variable, its pur- pose, and functionality:   The application object The application object is of the ServletContext  data type. It provides a set of methods to communicate with the container.  There is one context per web application, which means the application  object can access the entire application. This is known as application  scope. In general, separate contexts or applications do not share  variables.   In addition, the application variable is often used to acquire parameter  values from the context-param XML tag. This tag is used to initialize  variables from the deployment descriptor level. It is the same convenience  you are granted with a servlet, just made available to a JSP page. The  following example demonstrates the process.  The web.xml file might look something like the following:        paramName      paramValue     Within the JSP or scripting code, you could access this information by  making the subsequent call:  application.getInitParameter “paramName” ;  These variables are analogous to creating static global variables for your  web application.   Implicit Objects 323  The pageContext object The pageContext object provides the JSP with  information about the current request, also known as its page attributes.  These include any parameters, or handles to the session, request,  context, or outputStream object. The javax.servlet.jsp .PageContext abstract class provides the following convenience methods  to access other implicit objects from the pageContext:   cid:2  getOut     cid:2  getException     cid:2  getPage     cid:2  getRequest     cid:2  getResponse     cid:2  getSession     cid:2  getServletConfig     cid:2  getServletContext     cid:2  forward     cid:2  include     cid:2  handlePageException    It also provides methods for forwarding, inclusion, and error handling:   Because the pageContext object provides a single point of access, it is  also an ideal location to set attribute values for sharing data with all other  application components.  It has a page scope, which means the object can be accessed only directly,  through the _jspService …  method.  The config object The config object is of the ServletConfig data  type. It enables the container to pass information to the JSP page before  it is initialized. The scope of the config object is limited to the page.   An object limited to the page scope is bound to the javax.servlet.jsp .PageContext abstract class. This means the current JSP page is placed  inside the PageContext as long as the JSP page is responding to the cur- rent request. Using the PageContext’s implicit object, pageContext, you  can access the config attributes, such as all the namespaces or other classes  associated with the current JSP page, through the getAttribute String  name  method.    324 Chapter 9  cid:2  Java Server Pages  JSPs   The request object The request object initiates the _jspService …   method upon a client’s call. When created, the request object generates  header information, such as cookies, the intent or type of request, such as  a GET or POST, and possible parameters passed by the client.   The request object is bound to the ServletRequest interface, meaning  its data is accessible through the getAttribute String name  method.  It is designed, however, to support method calls to an implementation- specific subclass of javax.servlet.ServletRequest, such as  HttpServletRequest.   It has a request scope, which implies that the object’s reference exists as  long as the request is alive. Technically, a new request object is created  for the client request and destroyed when a response is generated. Even if  a forward …  or include …  is performed, the request object is still  in scope.   The response object The response object is an instance of the  implementation-specific subclass of the javax.servlet.ServletResponse  interface, often known as HttpServletResponse. Unlike servlets, it  enables HTTP status codes and headers in the JSP to be changed after out- put has been sent to the client. This is due to the output stream being  buffered  assuming the page directive buffer attribute is not set to none .  The response object has a page scope, which means it is bound to the  PageContext and can be accessed directly within the _jspService …   method—a period more commonly referred to as the life of the current  request.  The session object When a client makes a request, a session is automat- ically created to maintain client information. This object is referenced by  the session object and is available as long as session=false is not defined  with a page directive. By using the getAttribute String name  method,  you can retrieve data stored in an object by passing in a specified name.  As of the servlet 2.2 specification, the getValue String name  method is dep- recated and replaced with the getAttribute String name  method.   This object has a session scope, which means it exists for the life of the ses- sion and is bound to the PageContext. A session object is usually useful for  getting a unique ID associated with the entire transaction. For security    Implicit Objects 325  reasons, the current specification allows only for the retrieval of the  sessionID that is associated with the client request and passed to the  PageContext to make it available to the JSP. Previously, you could get a  list of sessions or a session by using an ID. This approached proved to be  less secure.  The out object The out object is used to write response information to the  client. It is of the class javax.servlet.jsp.JspWriter, which is a buff- ered version of the java.io.PrintWriter class. The buffered size can be  configured by using the buffer attribute in the page directive. For example:      The page object The page object is similar to the this keyword in Java.  It represents an instance of the servlet generated by the JSP page for the  current request. The page object exists for future use when another lan- guage can be specified by using the language attribute of the page directive.  Until then, it isn’t used much. When used in the future, it is important to  know it has a page scope.  The exception object The exception object is an instance of the  java.lang.Throwable class. It represents the uncaught Throwable  object that results in the error page being invoked. Let’s say an uncaught  exception is encountered during request processing, for example, a  RuntimeException; you could use the implicit exception object within  the error page to print out a stack trace.  If you use the errorPage attribute of the page directive, the exception object  is not available to that page. Only the error page itself can access the exception  object.  This object has page scope and can be used to help debug your code. The  following snippet demonstrates how:           In the code example, the error page prints a stack trace of the exception   object. The exam requires that you know the functionality of each  implicit object, its data type, and scope. Table 9.3 lists the characteristics  of each object.   326 Chapter 9  cid:2  Java Server Pages  JSPs   T A B L E 9 . 3 Implicit Objects and Their Scope  config  request  Implicit Object  Data Type  application  javax.servlet.ServletContext  javax.serlvet.SerlvetConfig  Scope  Application  Page  javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest  Request  response  javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse  Page  session  javax.servlet.http.HttpSession  Session  pageContext  javax.servlet.jsp.PageContext  out  page  javax.serlvet.jsp.JspWriter  java.lang.Object  exception  java.lang.Throwable  Page  Page  Page  Page  All implicit objects exist within a defined scope. The scope attribute   defines where the object can be referenced and when the reference is  removed. Each scope can be summarized in the following way:  Application scope Objects with an application scope are available for the  life of the application. All components assigned to this range have access to  pier components within the same context. Figure 9.5 provides a visual rep- resentation of the access area of an object with application scope.

It can be accessed directly within the _jspService …  method  or indirectly with any custom methods  provided there is a method that  returns a handle to the object  of the originating JSP page. Figure 9.6 dem- onstrates how the config object, which has a page scope, is available  within its original page, but uses a new config instance when a request  is transferred to a new page.  F I G U R E 9 . 6 Page scope  public class AnotherServlet… {         config = not in scope          config = in scope  public class MyServlet {   public void _jspService …request,…response  {      config.getServletContext  ;         …include …request,…response       …forward …request,…response     }   public void doSomething   {      getServletConfig  .getSerlvetContext  ;   } }  Request scope An object with a request scope is accessible from all  pages processing the same request. This includes dispatched requests. If a  request is transferred by using either of the RequestDispatcher methods  include …  or forward … , the component is in scope. Figure 9.7 shows  how an object with a request scope  for example, the request object  is  still in scope after a dispatch occurs.   Session scope Objects with a session scope are available for the life of  the session. Until the session is closed manually or automatically due to a  method call or a timeout, components can exist and share data. Figure 9.8  displays the available range for an object with a session scope.   328 Chapter 9  cid:2  Java Server Pages  JSPs   F I G U R E 9 . 7 Request scope  public class AnotherServlet… {         request = in scope          request = in scope  public class MyServlet {   public void _jspService …request,…response  {     request.getMethod  ;      …include request, response,…      …forward request, response,…    }   public void doSomething         HttpServletRequest req  {     req.getMethod  ;   } }  F I G U R E 9 . 8 Session scope  e p o c s    n I  Not in scope Session started  Servlet  Servlet  Servlet  e p o c s    n I  Session ended Not in scope  It is also important to understand the life cycle of implicit objects in order  to know how and when to use them. We have covered four scriptlet formats,  which include:  Expression   Expressions are evaluated at HTTP processing  time or when the HTTP server processes the request. Expressions are left  unprocessed until the buffer is written out to the client, meaning all  implicit objects have been initialized and are available.      Implicit Objects 329  Scriptlet   Scriptlets are executed at request-processing time and  embedded within the _jspService …  method. This means all implicit  objects have been initialized and can be accessed directly.   <%   out.print "Tomorrow or the next life,” +     “whichever comes first" ; %>  Declarations Declarations are initialized when the JSP’s jspInit    method is invoked. Its methods however, are available outside the  _jspService …  method. In order to access implicit objects, they must  either be passed as a parameter, or there must be an available servlet  method which provides a reference to the instance.  <%!   public String locateClient HttpServletRequest req  {      ServletConfig config = getServletConfig  ;      return req.getRemoteHost  ;   } %>  Directive    Directives are invoked at translation time. When  another page is included into the current page, its contents are inserted in  the _jspService …  method. The code for the included file is added to the  code of the calling JSP page, right where the include directive is placed.  Consequently, all the implicit objects are available to the code of the  included page. Consider the following example:  jspMain.jsp            second.jsp             330 Chapter 9  cid:2  Java Server Pages  JSPs   Actions  Implicit objects are a key feature to providing a JSP with all the function- ality available to a servlet. For greater functionality a JSP can use “actions”  to invoke a behavior.  Aside from displaying HTML and invoking scripts within your JSP   page, you might want to pass certain tasks off to another servlet or JSP to han- dle. You might even want to use a JavaBean to set or get property values useful  to the application—or maybe include some sort of plug-in within the web page.  These tasks can be realized by using actions. Actions are Java tags that affect the  runtime behavior of the JSP. In this section, we will go through each of the fol- lowing actions by discussing its purpose and syntax, and providing examples:   cid:2  jsp:include   cid:2  jsp:forward   cid:2  jsp:plugin   cid:2  jsp:param   cid:2  jsp:useBean   cid:2  jsp:setProperty   cid:2  jsp:getProperty  jsp:include  A servlet can transfer a request to another resource to manage the response  by using the RequestDispatcher. JSPs have this same functionality. Instead  of acquiring a handle to the dispatcher, the tag jsp:include, or the include  action, is used to temporarily transfer control and allow another resource  access to the current request and response objects. This tag enables you  to include either a static or dynamic resource. If static, the content of the  resource is included in the JSP page. If dynamic, the request is sent and  returned with a result included in the JSP page. After the action is finished,  the JSP container continues to process the rest of the JSP page.  An included page can access only the JspWriter object. It cannot set headers  or set cookies. Calls to related methods will be ignored.    Actions 331  Syntax  or            Example               Inclusion is processed at request time. Each attribute is evaluated and   parameters set, if necessary. The include tag has three attribute types that  can be used:  The page tag defines the relative URL of the target source. To include  multiple pages within a page, you must provide a separate jsp:include  action for each.   The param tag identifies any parameter values that need to be passed  to the target.   The flush tag is equal to either true or false. A true value signifies  that the page output is buffered and flushed prior to being returned to the  original JSP. A false value means the buffer is not flushed. The default  value is false.  In JSP 1.1, a bug within a provided JSP library class caused an error to generate  if the flush attribute was not specified or had a value of false. Developers were  required to specify the flush=true attribute to avoid receiving an error.  An include can be used in two ways. The first is as a directive with a file  attribute to “include” a static file at compile time. The second approach is via  an action. An include action uses the page attribute to incorporate another  file’s output, either static or dynamic, in the response at request time.  jsp:forward  Like the jsp:include, the forward action transfers control of the current  request handler to a specified resource. The target source is then responsible    332 Chapter 9  cid:2  Java Server Pages  JSPs   for generating the response. Similar to the RequestDispatcher’s forward …   method, all buffered output is cleared when the request response object is sent.  If the output has already been flushed, the system throws an exception.   The target source can be quite flexible. It can be an HTML file, another  JSP page, or a servlet, assuming all share the same application context as the  forwarding JSP page. After a forward action is invoked, execution of the  current page is terminated.  Any lines after the jsp:forward block are not processed.          <jsp:param name= “parameterName”         value=“parameterValue”>    Syntax  or   Example  <% if session.getAttribute “checkOut”   .equals “checkOut”   { %>           You can pass parameters to the target source by using the param tag, mak- ing it a dynamic resource. The name attribute defines the parameter, and the  value is either a case-sensitive literal String or an expression that is evalu- ated at request time.   The following rules apply to the output stream associated to a jsp:forward   action:   cid:2  If the page output is buffered, the buffer is cleared prior to forwarding.   cid:2  If the page output is buffered and the buffer was flushed, an attempt   to forward the request will result in an IllegalStateException.   cid:2  If the page output was unbuffered and anything has been written   to it, any attempt to forward the request will result in an  IllegalStateException.   Actions 333  jsp:plugin  When creating web applications, you might need to include Java plug-in  software to enhance the graphical or functional behavior. The plugin action,  defined as jsp:plugin, displays or plays an applet or bean in the browser. The  plug-in is either built into the browser or downloaded from a specific URL.  Syntax  <jsp:plugin     type=“beanapplet”    code=“classFileName.class”     [optional attributes]                         text message for user          The jsp:plugin element is made up of four parts: mandatory attributes,   optional attributes, the jsp:params tag, and the jsp:fallback tag.  Mandatory attributes indicate the type of plug-in component and its class  name. Table 9.4 lists the mandatory attributes for the jsp:plugin action.   T A B L E 9 . 4 jsp:plugin Mandatory Attribute List  Attribute  Description  type  code  The type of object the plug-in will execute. Your choices are bean or applet. There is no  default value for this attribute.  The class filename. You must include its  .class extension.  Optional attributes help locate the code, position the object within the   browser window, and specify any URL to download plug-in software.  Table 9.5 lists the optional attributes for the jsp:plugin action.    334 Chapter 9  cid:2  Java Server Pages  JSPs   T A B L E 9 . 5 jsp:plugin Optional Attribute List  Optional  Attribute  codebase  name  archive  align  height  width  hspace  vspace  jreversion  nspluginurl  iepluginurl  Description  The class file directory or path to the directory for the  Java class. If a directory is not specified, the JSP page  or path is used instead.  The name of the bean or applet instance.  A list of pathnames for files that will be preloaded.  Each file is separated by a comma.  The position of the plug-in output within the web page. Your choices are bottom, top, middle, left, or right.  The initial vertical pixel measurement of the  plug-in output. Not required, but some browsers will not require  a height of 0.  The initial horizontal pixel measurement of the  plug-in output. Not required, but some browsers will not allow  an object of 0 height.  The number of pixels to the left and right of the  plug-in output.   The number of pixels on the top and bottom of the  plug-in output.  The Java Runtime Version required to run the plug-in.  The default value is 1.2.  The URL where the plug-in can be downloaded from  Netscape Navigator.  The URL where the plug-in can be downloaded from  Microsoft Internet Explorer.   Actions 335  The jsp:plugin action has two sub-elements:  jsp:params allows parameter names and values to be passed to  the object.  jsp:fallback displays a text message for the user if the plug-in can- not be started. If it manages to start, but the bean or applet cannot,  then a pop-up dialog appears to explain the problem.  Example  <jsp:plugin type=“bean” code=“AnimatedLogoBean.class”       codebase=“com eei company”       name=“logo”        archive=“companyAdds.jar”       align=“top”       height=“50”       width=“150”       hspace=“5”       vspace=“5”       jreversion=“1.2”>           <jsp:param name=“message” value=“On the edge of           technology”  >                Sorry, but the Plug-in could not be started.                The preceding example displays an animated logo within a company’s   website. Although almost all attributes are used, they are not required. After  the JSP page is translated and invoked, the plug-in will be processed and  imbedded in the web page displayed for the client.  jsp:param  A param action is used to provide a name value pair to a servlet. It is used  in conjunction with the jsp:include, jsp:forward, and jsp:params  actions. A translation error occurs if the element is used elsewhere. New    336 Chapter 9  cid:2  Java Server Pages  JSPs   jsp:useBean  values take precedence over existing values and are scoped within the  include or forward page.  Syntax  For a single parameter:    Example     There are two mandatory attributes associated with the param action.   The first is called name. It is the name or key for the parameter. The second  attribute is value. It defines the value of the attribute.  A powerful feature of Java Server Pages is the ability to incorporate  JavaBeans within a page. The JSP tags handle the HTML, while the beans  handle the Java logic. The clean separation makes for better readability,  maintainability, and extensibility. This can be accomplished by using the  useBean action. By definition, a JavaBean is simply a class that contains  private data with accessor and mutator methods. These methods perform  all the necessary business logic to arrive at the appropriate result. In addi- tion, they have the ability to have their attributes changed dynamically.  Through reflection, the container can determine which attributes are vis- ible and changeable. JSPs benefit from this inclusion because a bean can  perform a distinct task and make the resulting information available to the  JSP page through an accessor method.   The benefit of using a JavaBean over a standard Java class is that with a   bean, the container can be triggered to set bean properties by using parameter  values from the client’s request. For example, if a JSP request object contains  a parameter of taxRate, and the bean has a method called setTaxRate float  txr , the server will invoke the method passing the attribute value.   The trigger that causes the server to set parameters is an action called  jsp:setProperty. When this action is used with the property attribute set to  an asterisk  * , the server links parameter data with the servlet’s data. We will  discuss this action in the section called “jsp:setProperty.”   Actions 337  Attributes  Through introspection, the server can dynamically update the bean so  the JSP page can access the attribute information without having to call  request.getParameter String name .  Syntax  <jsp:useBean id=“beanInstanceName”     scope=“pagerequestsessionapplication” {     class=“package.class”      type=“package.class”      class=“package.class” type=“package.class”      beanName=“{package.class   }”         type=“package.class” } {  >    }  You can use several attributes to define how the server should use or locate  the bean:  id Specifies the name of the bean. If a bean scope extends beyond the  current page, it can be saved. The key used to acquire the bean instance is  the id name. If the bean instance does not exist, a new bean is created.  This variable is case sensitive. The name must be unique within the trans- lation unit. Duplicate IDs will result in a fatal translation error.  scope Specifies the extent of the bean’s visibility. There are four options  to choose from: page, request, session, or application.   page scope The bean variable is stored as an instance variable.  Within the page, the bean is used once and then destroyed. You can  use the bean within the JSP page or any of the page’s static include  files. This means files acquired via the include directive are within  scope, while pages acquired from the include action are not in scope.  request scope The bean instance is stored as a request attribute.  This means the bean can be used from any JSP page processing the  same request. Whereas a page scope ends at the onset of a jsp:forward  action, a request scope keeps the bean alive through jsp:forward and    338 Chapter 9  cid:2  Java Server Pages  JSPs   jsp:include actions. When the response is returned, the bean is  destroyed.   session scope The bean instance is stored as the user’s session  attribute. Consequently, the bean exists across the entire session. If the  client disconnects, the bean will be made available when the client recon- nects. By default, the session attribute is true. For this reason, it is not  necessary to include the session attribute for a session object to be cre- ated. If a JSP is defined to not participate in a session via the <%@ page  … %> directive, and attempts to, a fatal transaction error will occur.  application scope The bean instance is stored as a servlet context  attribute and therefore available to the entire application.   class Specifies the class name of the bean. When the bean is con- structed, the server uses the fully qualifying class name to generate the  instance. If the bean already exists, the class name is not necessary.  type Defines the class type used to cast the bean to its appropriate  data type. When the object is retrieved from a particular scope, it is returned  as a generic object. The bean is then cast to the class type defined. If the  type is not defined, the value defaults to the same type as that defined  by the class variable. If they do not match, a ClassCastException  is thrown. By providing a type attribute without class or beanName  attributes, you can give a local name to an object defined in another JSP  page or servlet.  beanName Replaces the class attribute to create the bean instance. This  value is passed as a parameter to the java.beans.Beans.instantiate …   method to create the instance. It enables developers to dynamically create  the bean, because the attribute can accept a request-time attribute expres- sion as a value.  It is not valid to provide both class and beanName.  Example  <jsp:useBean id=“tax” class=“com.eei.TaxBean”   scope=“application”  >   Actions 339  The jsp:useBean action attempts to first locate an instance of the bean.   If unsuccessful, a new bean will be created from a class or serialized tem- plate. The following steps are taken to process the bean:  1. An attempt to locate a bean with the scope and ID name you specified   is made.  2. An object reference variable with the name you specified is defined.  3. If the bean is located, a reference to the variable is stored. The bean   is then cast to the given type. If the cast fails, a java.lang .ClassCastException is thrown.  4. If the bean is not located, and:  b. Neither class nor beanName is given, a java.lang  .InstantiatedException is thrown.   c. class is provided, but is either abstract, an interface, or has   no public no-args constructor  meaning it cannot be instanti- ated , then a java.lang.InstantiatedException is thrown.  d. class is provided and has a no-args constructor, then the class   is instantiated.  e. beanName is provided, then the java.beans.Beans  .instantiate   is invoked and the reference is stored to the  id name.   5. If the bean is instantiated, and it has body tags between the   jsp:useBean tags, those elements are executed.  There are two major advantages of using JavaBeans within a JSP. The first  is the ability to set attributes, and the second is the ability to define the scope  of the bean. While we have discussed the latter, we now need to address the  technique used to set properties within the bean.  jsp:setProperty  The most significant feature of a bean is its property values. The setProperty  action is used to set the parameter values of the bean in use. The bean’s “get”  and “set” methods are designed to change these values through reflection.  For the container to achieve this task, the methods must begin with a get or  set followed by the property name using an initial capital letter. The power  of this design is that it enables the container to transfer the request parameter    340 Chapter 9  cid:2  Java Server Pages  JSPs   values from a client request, which could come from a form, to a JSP, which  uses a bean and sets the properties to that bean by using the information  entered by the client.   Syntax  <jsp:setProperty name=“beanInstanceName” {     property=“*”      property=“propertyName” [param=“parameterName”]      property=“propertyName" value=”{string literal       }” }  >  Examples      <jsp:setProperty name=“bean” property=“name”                  param=“user”  > <jsp:setProperty name=“bean” property=“name”                  value=“Ariela”  >  The jsp:setProperty element enables the bean’s properties to be set via  the request parameters or directly. The first example uses a wildcard to indi- cate all request parameters should be mapped to the instance bean and  altered if there is a match. The second example defines the bean property  name that needs to be assigned a value from the request. The third example  is used when the request parameter name is not the same name as the bean  property. By listing both, the container can map the two together. Finally, the  fourth example directly assigns a value to the bean property regardless of  the request. Figure 9.9 demonstrates how information from the client is  transferred to the bean.  The image describes a scenario in which the user enters an ID and pass- word into a form. The information is then bundled in a request object and  sent to the JSP page. If necessary, a bean instance is created and the container  will then use the “set” methods to mutate the bean properties to match those  sent through the client request. If the names are different, the param attribute  is used to map the property to the request parameter. Table 9.6 outlines the  jsp:setProperty attributes.

The name used must  match the id attribute in the jsp:useBean element.  The name of the bean property. When a wildcard  *  is  used to define the property, the container will search  through all request parameters to find a match to the  bean property. When a match is found, the request  parameter value is assigned to the property. If the  request parameter is an empty string  “” , then the  property is left unaltered.   342 Chapter 9  cid:2  Java Server Pages  JSPs   T A B L E 9 . 6 jsp:setProperty Attribute List  continued   Attribute  Description  param  value  The name assigned to the request parameter. This  attribute must be used in conjunction with property.  Basically, it maps the request parameter name to the  name of the property in the bean. If param is not used, it  assumes the request parameter is the same as the prop- erty. If, however, there is no request parameter with the  param name, or if its value is “”, then the container will  leave the bean property unaltered.  The value assigned to the bean property. This can either  be a request object parameter, a request time-evaluated  expression, or a specific string.  There is one more important feature to know about the jsp:setProperty  element. Not all bean properties are Strings; consequently, you need to know  how the container manages bean properties of other data types. When the client  sends a request, the parameter values are always of type String. These values  are converted to their appropriate data types when stored in the bean’s prop- erty. The JavaBeans specification states that the setAsText String name   method should be used on a property if it has a PropertyEditor class. If a  conversion failure occurs, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. By  default, PropertyEditors are provided for all primitive and respective  wrapper classes. If the property is of a data type that is not available, the  String will get converted to that of type Object.  After the property value is set, the JSP can retrieve this information by   using the jsp:getProperty element.   jsp:getProperty  As easy as it is to set a bean’s property from within a JSP page, you can get the  values with similar ease by using the getProperty action, or jsp:getProperty  action. When retrieving a bean’s property, it is converted to a String by using  either the toString   method or the wrapper class valueOf String str   method if it is a primitive. Once converted, the results are passed to the out- put stream and finally to the client.    Actions 343  Syntax  <jsp:getProperty name=“beanInstanceName”       property=“propertyName”  > Example  Let’s start by using the following bean, which holds customer  information:  public class CustomerBean {     private String name;     …       public void setName String name  {       this.name = name;     }     public String getName   {       return this.name;     }     … }   The web page might allow the user to enter their name, and then that   value could be set by using the jsp:setProperty action. Later, in another  area, we could retrieve that value by using the jsp:getProperty tag. The  following code snippet demonstrates the process:  <jsp:useBean id=“custBean” scope=“session”   class=“CustomerBean” >                       Hello <jsp:getProperty name=“custBean”                       property=“name”  >!      Assuming the person entered their name as Yoav, the output generated   would simply display the following message:  Hello Yoav! The process of extracting data is similar to that of the setting it. After the   property value is set for the bean, a call to jsp:getProperty contacts  the identified bean  in this case it’s the CustomerBean  and invokes its    344 Chapter 9  cid:2  Java Server Pages  JSPs   getName   method. The return value is then sent to the JSP output stream  and converted to a String for display purposes.  Here are some points to consider:   cid:2  You must first create an instance of the bean by using the jsp:useBean   element before calling the jsp:getProperty tag.   cid:2  The jsp:getProperty tag works on JavaBeans, but not on enterprise  beans. Enterprise beans are formatted to run within an application server  and follow a template form very different from a basic JavaBean. You  could, however, have your JSP tag communicate with a JavaBean, which  communicates with an enterprise bean. It’s a fair workaround.   cid:2  If you use the jsp:getProperty tag on a property whose value is   equal to null, a NullPointerException is thrown. If you are using  a scriptlet or expression to retrieve this value, the null keyword is  returned instead.   cid:2  You cannot use jsp:getProperty to retrieve values of an indexed  property. An indexed property is an object that is either a collection  or array.  Table 9.7 lists the available attributes for the jsp:getAttribute action.  T A B L E 9 . 7 jsp:getProperty Attribute List   Attribute  Description  name  The name of the bean instance.

As a result, they were paying huge funds to  a consulting group to develop and maintain their servlet-driven web site.  Recently, however, they decided on a new long-term approach. Instead of  investing in training their staff in Java development, they will convert their  application to utilize Java Server Pages, which talk to servlets on the front  end. This approach limits their costs because their web designers can focus  on designing the interface; the company needs to contract out only the serv- let and bean pieces of the application. By separating the Presentation layer  from the Business Logic layer, they are able to utilize their staff more effi- ciently and cut down on long-term maintenance costs.    346 Chapter 9  cid:2  Java Server Pages  JSPs   Summary  In this chapter, we covered the basic essentials of a JSP—starting with   its life cycle and moving on to syntactical features. There were two major  coding options discussed in this chapter. The first is the utilization of a tag,  and the second is the utilization of an action.   All four tag types were covered in great detail to ensure you understand  the syntax and purpose behind a scriptlet, expression, declaration, and direc- tive. Each directive type, include, page, and taglib, was described to  further help define the particulars associated with a directive. Within these  tags you were shown how to acquire access to common objects, known as  implicit objects. They include request, response, out, session, config,  application, page, pageContext, and exception.  The second half of the chapter focused on the available action types and   their behaviors. The list of actions included jsp:param, jsp:include,  jsp:forward, jsp:useBean, jsp:setProperty, jsp:getProperty,  and jsp:plugin.  A solid understanding of the JSP  and XML  syntax, plus knowledge of  how each of these features works will help increase your score substantially  in the JSP section of the exam.  Be able to explain the JSP life cycle. A JSP page goes through a mor- phing process before it can be accessed. Because certain actions take place  before and after it translates, knowledge of the process helps you write a  more efficient and accurate Java Server Page.  Be able to identify the JSP and XML syntax, purpose, and use of each tag  type. There are four tag types, known as directive, declaration, scriptlet,  and expression. It is important to know how to write each correctly by  using either JSP tags or XML tags. Although JSP scriptlet syntax was used  originally, XML syntax is becoming the communication standard within  the J2EE environment.   Be able to define and identify the purpose and functionality or use of implicit  objects. There are nine implicit objects available to a servlet page  JSP page  translated  during the service …  method. For convenience, they provide  handles to critical information within the scripting section of your JSP page.  Exam Essentials   Key Terms 347  Be able to identify, use, and define JSP actions. Again, you are expected  to know the details associated with each action and its syntax. This infor- mation is necessary to build a suitable JSP page that can accomplish desired  tasks. These actions also help separate the Logic from the Presentation layer.

The method _jspService HttpServletRequest req,   HttpServletResponse res  should not be overridden by the JSP  developer. The first and third options fail to define the correct method   The preceding underscore is missing.  If a developer defined either  method, it would not be considered an override.  2. B.  When a client makes a request, and a JSP instance doesn’t already  exist, the appropriate JSP page  .jsp  is located and translated to  servlet source code  .java . The JSP servlet is then compiled  .class ,  and the class file is loaded into memory. An instance of the servlet is  then created.  3. D.  The jspInit   method is first called to initialize the JSP servlet  when it is first loaded into memory. The _jspService   method is  then called with each future request. Finally, when the JSP is about to  be removed, the jspDestroy   method is called.  4. D.  javax.servlet.jsp.JspPage is an interface, not a class. Each   JSP servlet must ultimately implement this interface.  5. B.  The _jspService method is defined within the javax.servlet .jsp.HttpPage interface. The method should not be overridden as it  is implemented by the container.  6. B.  A method must be defined within a declaration, not a scriptlet. All   other code types are legal within a scriptlet.  7. D.  There are four packages that do not need to be imported in a JSP  page, because they are implicitly imported. They include java.lang.*,  javax.servlet.*, javax.servlet.jsp.*, and javax.servlet .http.*.  8. A.  A session attribute defaults to a true value, suggesting a client  must join an HTTP session in order to use the JSP page. The buffer  attribute defines the size of the out object, while isThreadSafe and  isErrorPage default to false.  9. A.  A forward slash defines the file as relative to the JSP application’s  document root directory and is resolved by the web server. Without  the slash, the file is considered relative to the current JSP page.  10. D.  The first three tag prefixes are reserved by Sun Microsystems.   However, servletx is available.   Answers to Review Questions 353  11. C.  An application scope means the bean is available to the entire  application. Because the servlet context applies to the entire applica- tion, the instance is stored as an attribute to this object.  12. B.  The beanName attribute used within the jsp:useBean element  instantiates a bean by using the passed-in bean name  assuming an  instance does not already exist .  13. D.  The type and code are both required attributes of the jsp:plugin  element. The type must be marked as bean  remember, attributes are  case sensitive  and the code must include the .class extension. Finally,  if jreversion is not included, it defaults to the 1.2 version.  14. A.  import is an attribute of the page directive, not a directive itself.  15. D.  A page directive is used to define characteristics of the JSP page.  This includes whether the page will participate in sessions, or whether  the output buffer will automatically flush when it is full, or whether  multiple clients can make simultaneous requests because the page is  thread-safe. The majority of these options are defined with a true or  false value. The uri, however, is the address or Uniform Resource  Identifier for the tag library descriptor in a taglib descriptive.

We showed  how actions provide limited functionality to enable the JSP to perform cer- tain tasks, while scriptlets handle everything else. A JSP page made up of  these components is useful, but it does not provide a solution that enables  you to completely exclude all Java code from the JSP page. For example,  what if you wanted the JSP page to generate a table on the fly? This could be  done with HTML, but the ability to highlight a row or change the content to  another language is limited. Scriptlet or servlet code would be required.  Inevitably, the lack of functionality available in the standard JSP actions  results in the developer having to write Java code in two ways: either embed  a plethora of scriptlet code within the page or create a servlet to handle the  functionality. The first option is not optimal because scriptlet code makes a  page difficult to read, maintain, and expand. The second option is feasible,   action every  but requires the developer to provide an  time a custom behavior is needed. Each attribute name must be known in  order to set its value; in addition, each attribute must be listed in a separate   tag. Again, this approach works, but means that any complex  jsp:param graphical functionality must be handled within a servlet rather than a JSP.  Ideally, all presentation-related logic should be handled by the JSP. This  chapter discusses how to expand the current JSP library by enabling devel- opers to create custom JSP actions.  include  forward   or   The use of   custom tags    also known as      helps provide a clear division of labor between the web page designer and the  software developer. Similar to XML, a custom tag takes the place of script- lets, and sometimes beans, to provide the web designer the functionality to  accomplish a particular task. Instead of doing the following:  custom actions  tag extensions   or   The random number assigned to you is:       The designer could use a tag to accomplish the task: The random number assigned to you is:                                                       358  Chapter 10  cid:2   Using Custom Tags  A Basic Custom Tag  F  forms correctly:   Designing the page becomes a matter of plugging in the appropriate tags  to achieve the correct design. The developer, on the other hand, creates tag  classes to accomplish generic tasks. In fact, custom tags can take the place of  servlets to provide an all-JSP Presentation tier. Each task can be customized  via attributes passed from the calling page at runtime. The tag has access to  all objects available to the JSP page, such as  .  out In addition to being nested, custom tags can also communicate with one  another. They allow for complex behavior while ultimately simplifying the  readability and maintainability of the JSP page.  ,  response request  , and   our components are required to ensure that a custom tag action per-  MyTagName.class tag’s functionality.   is the custom action class you write to define the   taglibName.tld   is an XML file that defines a tag library.  web.xml is an XML file that contains tag libraries available to the  application.  MyJspPage.jsp is a JSP page that utilizes tags defined in the associated  web.xml document.  A custom tag’s body or functionality must exist in a special class that  ultimately implements the Tag interface. This interface defines the life-cycle  methods of the tag, enabling developers to include appropriate logic where  necessary.  To simplify implementation, the API also provides a support class called  BodyTagSupport. This class reduces the number of methods the developer  must define. We will talk about the interfaces and supporting classes in  greater detail as the chapter progresses. Listing 10.1 is a code example of a  basic tag, which generates a random value.  Listing 10.1: A Basic Custom JSP Tag   package tagext;  import java.io.*;   A Basic Custom Tag 359  import javax.servlet.jsp.*; import javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.*;  public class RandomValue extends BodyTagSupport {         public int doStartTag   throws JspException {         return SKIP_BODY;     }     public int doEndTag   throws JspException {         int value =  int  Math.random  * 100 ;                try {             pageContext.getOut  .write value ;         } catch  IOException e  {             throw new JspException e.getMessage   ;         }         return EVAL_PAGE;     } } On a simple level, the two methods defined contain the behavior of the tag.   The doStartTag   is called to process the start, or opening, tag of the  instance. Depending on the constant returned, the body that lies between  the opening and closing tag will be either executed or ignored. Although  this method is not necessary in this example, because it performs default  behavior, it is included to help you understand what is being called. Next,  the doEndTag   method is invoked. In this example, a random value is gen- erated and written to the tag’s output stream. When compiled, the custom  JSP class file should be placed within the application context’s  WEB-INF  classes directory.  The next step is to create a tag library descriptor  TLD    file. A TLD is an  XML document that describes a tag library. It contains one or many related  custom tag extensions. For this example, our TLD file tagext.tld might  look like the following:    <!DOCTYPE taglib PUBLIC   "-  Sun Microsystems,Inc.  DTD JSP Tag Library 1.2  EN"   "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-jsptaglibrary_1_2.dtd">     360 Chapter 10  cid:2  Using Custom Tags      1.0      1.2      demo      Simple demo library.                randomValue          tagext.RandomValue          empty          First example          …   Each custom tag is embedded within its own set of    ele-  ments. Name and content information is included to enable other JSPs to  identify and use a particular tag. We will discuss each tag in detail later.  For now, we will map our tagext.tld file to the application via the  web.xml document. The following elements must be included within the  deployment descriptor to allow all JSPs to utilize the defined custom tags:    <!DOCTYPE web-app PUBLIC   "-  Sun Microsystems,Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"   "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">             http:  www.acme tagext              WEB-INF classes tagext.tld        …   The taglib element encapsulates information for the container to locate   the library file. Once accessible, all JSPs within the application, including                                                        F I G U R E 1 0 . 1  Custom tag mapping  A Basic Custom Tag  361  MyJspPage.jsp fashion:  , can utilize each   taglib   or custom tag in the following           Your lucky number          The random number assigned to you is:                  The JSP defines the tag element, which maps to the    file, which  , which maps to the specialized tag class.

The remainder of this chapter will focus on the details associated  with each of these components. In this section, we will address the nuances  used to customize and add additional functionality to a custom tag:    cid:2  Defining a tag   cid:2  Using the taglib element  Defining a Tag  A custom tag, or tag extension, is similar in structure to a standard JSP action  tag. It is made up of four parts: a name, attributes, nested tags, and a body:  Tag name This is a name that uniquely identifies the element. It consists  of two parts: a prefix and suffix. The prefix  is a predefined name that links  the action to a tag library. The suffix is the name of the element used to  invoke the action. The prefix and suffix are separated by a colon.  Attributes These help define the characteristics necessary for the element  to perform its task. For example, class is an attribute for jsp:useBean  that defines the class name used to instantiate the bean. An element can  have as many or as few attributes as necessary. Attributes are optional.  Nested tags A tag can contain subtags that provide further functionality,  helping the outer tag complete its task. The subtags jsp:setAttribute or  jsp:getAttribute enable the jsp:useBean action to change and access  its attribute values. Nested tags are observed and executed at runtime.  Body The content between the opening tag and closing tag, including  subtags, is considered the body content . A tag extension can control the  body content by extracting it from the element’s class file and returning a  changed value.  Syntactically, a tag extension can look like the following:              body    Each suffix represents a different JSP tag name associated with a tag class  file. A JSP page can call any tag defined within the application’s deployment  descriptor, as long as the tag has been specified by the JSP taglib directive.   Using the taglib Element  A Basic Custom Tag 363  Before a tag extension can be used within a JSP page, three things must happen:  1. The JSP page  must include a taglib element to identify which tag   libraries to load into memory.  2. The web.xml  document must use a taglib element to identify the   3. The TLD  file must use the taglib element to identify each custom tag   location of the TLD file.  and its attributes.  The JSP Page  You are required to use the taglib directive within the JSP page to identify  the use of custom tags. Because the tag contains the necessary information to  load the appropriate TLD, it must be defined before any custom tag is used.  Once loaded, the TLD, or tag library, provides the current JSP with addi- tional names and attributes of available custom actions.  Locating the correct tag library requires the inclusion of two mandatory  attributes along with the taglib directive: uri and prefix. The syntax is as  follows:    You can use the uri attribute in two ways. First, you can map it directly  to the uri attribute used within the web.xml’s taglib sub-element, called  taglib-uri. When these two values match, the other sub-element within  the web.xml file, called taglib-location, will define the absolute location  of the file. The second option is for the uri attribute to provide the absolute  path to the TLD. At that point, the web.xml file does not need to provide  location information. The container will use the information from the JSP  page to map to the TLD via the deployment descriptor. Both options are pro- vided to enable the developer to conveniently define the location of the TLD  file or to use more abstract measures that grant greater long-term flexibility. The prefix attribute is also mandatory and defines the prefix name in the  tag extension. For example, if prefix=“eei”, then the tag for an element  called calculate would look like  . The actual value  assigned to the prefix attribute is an arbitrary name defined by the HTML  designer to enable the JSP container to map the tag to the real tag library. In  addition to defining the first portion of a tag extension, the prefix also maps  to the shortname element defined within the TLD. When the container                                                                       364  Chapter 10  cid:1   Using Custom Tags  uri  taglib   directive, it knows to download the library identified   encounters the  by the  knows which library to search—to efficiently locate the identified tag. This  process is known as   .

The JSP uses the DTD to locate the TLD. When  a JSP attempts to invoke a custom tag, the tag must first be located, and then  processed. By modifying the deployment descriptor to include mapping infor- mation to the tag library, the JSP can locate the necessary actions to invoke.      tags. Embedded within, the URI and exact directory  and closing    location are defined by using both the  taglib-location tags, respectively. The following code snippet demonstrates how to include  two libraries within the application’s   A tag library is defined within the DTD by using the opening   taglib-uri     web.xml   and    file:    <!DOCTYPE web-app PUBLIC   "-  Sun Microsystems,Inc.  DTD Web Application 2.3  EN"   "http:  java.sun.com dtd web-app_2_3.dtd">      …                taglib1                   WEB-INF tlds GeneralTagLib.tld                       http:  www.eei.com taglib2                   WEB-INF tlds SpecificTagLib.tld          A Basic Custom Tag 365        …   First, it is important to notice the web.xml DOCTYPE is web-app. Later,  when we provide a closer look at the TLD file, you will see that the DOCTYPE  is defined as taglib. In addition, the actual DTD file  web-app_2.3.dtd   used to define the web.xml file is different from that used to define TLD files.  The taglib element has two sub-elements. The first sub-element is   taglib-uri. It specifies the URI that all JSPs should use to access that tag  library. Its path can contain either an absolute path, which includes host and  port number, or a relative path using published directories. The mapping  between the URI and the actual destination of the TLD is done by using the  second sub-element, called taglib-location. This element is used to define  the exact location of the TLD file. Unlike the URI, it can contain nonpub- lished directories such as  WEB-INF and its subdirectories.   When defining paths, it is important to know the difference between the   three formats:  Context-relative path If the path starts with a forward slash    , then  the path is relative to the application’s context path.   Page-relative path If the path does not start with a slash, then it is rela- tive to the current JSP page or file. If the include directive is used, which  incorporates the response of the identified file attribute, then the URI is  relative to that defined file. If the include action is used, then the URI  is relative to the page attribute’s value.  Absolute path This is the full path, starting with the protocol and host,  necessary to locate the tag library file.  There should not be more than one taglib-uri entry with the same value in  a single web.xml file.  Generally, the taglib-location element is mapped to a context-relative  path, which begins with a forward slash    , and does not include a protocol  or host definition. Specifically, this path is referred to as the TLD resource  path. The TLD resource path is relative to the root of the web application  and should resolve to a TLD file directly, or to a JAR file that has a TLD file  located in the  WEB-INF directory.    366 Chapter 10  cid:2  Using Custom Tags  The following is an example of how the mapping applies.  DTD file:         tagDir              WEB-INF tld taglib.tld         Maps to the JSP file taglib directive:     Both URIs map to each other, while the location identifies where the   taglib.tld file resides. After the library is located, the container will load  it into memory and examine its contents.  Tag Library Descriptor  TLD   As you know, the tag library descriptor, or TLD, is an XML document used  to identify and describe the list of custom tag extensions associated with a  single tag library. The file contains general information about the library,  and available extensions, along with their attributes. Listing 10.2 displays a  library containing two tags.

After a tag is defined, it can then be configured to perform its task by using  the information and attributes provided. Let’s begin by revisiting the second  tag in code Listing 10.2:         goodbye       tagext.GoodByeTag       JSP       Second example                 age           true           true           java.lang.Integer          We could invoke this tag within our JSP page in the following   fashion:   <examples:goodbye age=   ”<%=         new Integer application.getInitParameter “age”         %>” >   This example provides one attribute called age. It is required and enables  the value to be assigned at runtime by using an expression. Because its return  type is of the java.lang.Integer class, the expression must convert the  String value to an Integer object.  Talking to the World  For several years, WorldTalk Inc. has provided the Internet community a  service that translates websites to the clients’ desired language. To ensure  that their teams of designers are specialized experts in design and that their  teams of developers are experts in programming, the company has begun to  separate worker tasks.   372 Chapter 10  cid:2  Using Custom Tags  Standard JSPs have greatly helped the company move toward this goal,  because the JSPs enable designers to focus on HTML and use available  tags to take care of basic functionality. The problem with this approach is  that designers are forced to create complex HTML code that is not reus- able because they are using JSP and have limited default programming  functionality.   To solve this problem, management chose to migrate the application  toward the use of custom tags. The development team began working on a  library of tags that provide translation functionality. For example, designers  can now use a tag called formatDate.jsp to present the date in the appro- priate fashion. Optional attributes include the locale of the machine, the  pattern describing the date style, the value being the actual date, and  others. By creating a library of tags, the developers have enabled the  designers to create pages by utilizing tags that handle all the functionality  necessary to create the item or result desired. The developers handle  Unicode translations, and the designers focus on layout.  The final piece needed to bring custom extensions together is the actual  tag class. In the next section, we will discuss the various types of custom tags  and their life cycles.  As with all Java advanced technologies, creating a component that   conforms to a particular API requires the implementation of an interface.  Custom tags abide by this rule. When you are creating a custom tag, it  is required that the class implement the interface javax.servlet.jsp .tagext.Tag. The interface provides several important methods that  define the life cycle of the tag. By implementing the methods correctly,  the container can manage the tag to deliver an expected and consistent  behavior.  The Tag interface is the most basic protocol between the Tag handler and  the implementing JSP page. It defines the methods that should be invoked  at the starting and ending tag. The interface javax.servlet.jsp.tagext .IterationTag is a subinterface and provides additional functionality   Tag Handler                                                      Tag Handler  373  whereby the tag can loop through its body multiple times. Still one level  lower is the  the manipulation of the body content. By implementing any one of these  interfaces and a little work, you can create a custom tag that suits your needs.  javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.BodyTag   interface, which allows   To minimize the work, the API provides support classes, which imple- ment the interfaces for you. They define the most uncommonly changed  methods and leave the most frequently modified methods abstract.

We will discuss  these features in detail.   374 Chapter 10  cid:2  Using Custom Tags  Tag Interface  As mentioned earlier, the javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.Tag interface  defines the most basic protocol between the tag handler and the JSP page  that invokes the instance. If you choose to implement this interface, you must  define the following six methods:   cid:2  setPageContext PageContext pageContext    cid:2  setParent Tag tag    cid:2  getParent     cid:2  doStartTag     cid:2  doEndTag     cid:2  release    The first method that is invoked by the container sets the pageContext  object, which provides a handle to all the implicit objects. Its signature is as  follows:  public void setPageContext  PageContext pageContext  The container passes the context to the tag to enable access to the appli- cation’s implicit variables. Through the PageContext convenience methods,  such as getRequest  , you can alter or provide more information to your  tag handler. This method is usually defined by saving a local instance of the  context object.  The second method that is invoked by the container is setParent Tag   tag . Its purpose is to provide a local handle to the closest enclosing tag  handler. If a tag is nested within another tag, the handle to the outer tag is  made available to the inner tag. Given the existence of the corresponding  getParent   method, tags can communicate with one another by using the  Tag handle instance. The signature to these methods is as follows:  public void setParent Tag tag  public Tag getParent   After the setPageContext …  and setParent …  methods are called,  the container can begin to process the beginning tag by first invoking any  “set” property methods to set needed tag attributes. For example, if the tag  has a String attribute called name, then a corresponding setName …   method within the tag handler will automatically be invoked. The container  will then continue to initialize the tag by calling doStartTag  . In addition  to initializing the tag even further, this method is responsible for notifying    Tag Handler 375  the container about how to evaluate the body of the tag element. The body  represents the logic between the opening and closing tags. The method  signature is as follows:  public int doStartTag   throws JspException Depending on how you would like the body to be handled, you can return   one of the following constants:  int EVAL_BODY_INCLUDE This constant indicates that the body should  be evaluated. Results generated from executing the body are written to the  current JspWriter out variable.  int SKIP_BODY This constant indicates that the body should not be  evaluated.  Depending on the return value, the body will be either evaluated or   skipped. The doEndTag   method is then invoked. It processes the end tag  for the element to determine how the remaining JSP page should be evalu- ated. The signature for the method is as follows:  public int doEndTag   throws JspException As you can see, this method returns an int value as well. Again, the   constant informs the container about how to proceed. The following return  values are available:  int EVAL_PAGE As the name suggests, this constant indicates that the  container should evaluate the rest of the JSP page.  int SKIP_PAGE This option indicates that the rest of the page should  not be evaluated and that the request is in fact complete. If this request  was created by a forward or include from another page, then only the  current JSP page is complete.  The specification states that if the TLD defines the action’s body-content  as empty, then the doStartTag   method must return SKIP_BODY.  If SKIP_BODY is returned and a body is present, it is not evaluated.  Both the doStartTag   and doEndTag   methods throw a JspException   in their signatures. If the method actually throws the exception, the con- tainer will generate an error page to notify the client of a JSP problem.                                                   376  Chapter 10  cid:1   Using Custom Tags  The final method that must be defined is used to clean up any loose ends.   The signature is as follows:  public void release   When the tag is done processing the beginning element, the body, and the   ending element, the container invokes this method to release the tag han- dler’s state. Figure 10.3 displays the life cycle for the    interface.

Pre- viously, we showed you how we invoked such an action; now we will show  you the actual code used to generate the action. Listing 10.3 displays the  necessary code to implement the    interface.  Tag  Listing 10.3: Utilizing the Tag Interface  package tagext;  import java.io.*; import javax.servlet.jsp.*; import javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.*;   Tag Handler 377  public class RandomValue implements Tag {     private PageContext pageContext;     private Tag parent;      public int doStartTag   throws JspException {         return SKIP_BODY;     }          public int doEndTag   throws JspException {         int value =  int  Math.random   * 100 ;          try {             pageContext.getOut  .write "" + value ;         } catch  IOException ioe  {             throw new JspException ioe.getMessage   ;         }         return EVAL_PAGE;     }      public void release   {}      public void setPageContext PageContext pageContext  {         this.pageContext = pageContext;     }     public void setParent Tag parent  {         this.parent = parent;     }      public Tag getParent   {         return this.parent;     } } In this example, the doStartTag   method notifies the container to skip   the body and immediately invoke doEndTag  . This method generates a  random value and writes it to the JspWriter out object. When the method  completes, the rest of the JSP page will be evaluated. One thing you should  notice is that within a custom action, you do not have direct access to    378 Chapter 10  cid:2  Using Custom Tags  IterationTag Interface  implicit objects. Instead, handles to these variables are accessible from  the pageContext object passed as an instance by the container. In the  preceding example, the implicit out JspWriter is accessed by calling  pageContext.getOut  .  The PageContext class provides the following convenience methods for  access to implicit objects: getOut  , getException  , getPage  ,  getRequest  , getResponse  , getSession  , getServletConfig  , and  getServletContext  .  The javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.IterationTag interface extends the  Tag interface and adds one additional method. As the name suggests, this  interface enables the body of the element to be executed multiple times. The  functionality is similar to a do while loop.  In addition to the standard doStartTag   and doEndTag   methods,  the IterationTag interface adds the doAfterBody   method. When this  method is implemented, the developer can opt to have the body evaluated  again. The signature is as follows:  public int doAfterBody   throws JspException Depending on how you would like the body to be handled, you can return   one of the following constants:  int EVAL_BODY_AGAIN This indicates that the body should be reevalu- ated. The doAfterBody   method will get called again after evaluating  the body.  int SKIP_BODY This notifies the container that the body should not be  evaluated. The value of out will be restored, and the doEndTag   method  will be invoked.  If SKIP_BODY is returned, the body is not evaluated and the doEndTag   is then  invoked.  As we said, this interface acts like a do while loop. It enables the body to  be evaluated  that’s the do part , and calls doAfterBody    that’s the while                                     Tag Handler  379  part  to determine whether to reevaluate the body.

Listing 10.4 takes our pre- vious JSP, which generated a single random value, and now has it generate  five random values.  Listing 10.4: Utilizing the IterationTag Interface  package tagext;  import java.io.*; import javax.servlet.jsp.*; import javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.*;  public class MoreRandomValues implements IterationTag {     private PageContext pageContext;   380 Chapter 10  cid:2  Using Custom Tags      private Tag parent;     private int counter;          public void setPageContext PageContext pageContext  {         this.pageContext = pageContext;     }     public void setParent Tag parent  {         this.parent = parent;     }      public int doStartTag   throws JspException {         return EVAL_BODY_INCLUDE;     }      public int doAfterBody   throws JspException {         int value =  int  Math.random   * 100 ;         counter++;         if  0 < counter && counter<5  {             try {                 pageContext.getOut  .write " " + value ;             } catch  IOException ioe  {                 throw new JspException ioe.getMessage   ;             }             return EVAL_BODY_AGAIN;         } else {             return SKIP_BODY;         }     }       public int doEndTag   throws JspException {         return EVAL_PAGE;     }      public void release   {         counter=0;     }   Tag Handler 381      public Tag getParent   {         return this.parent;     } } In this example, the doAfterBody   method generates a new random value   if the body has been evaluated fewer than five times. It then takes that  value and writes it to the JspWriter object. Because we are simply writing  text to the response stream, we access the implicit out variable through the  pageContext object and invoke the write …  method, which takes a String  value. The resulting output displays four consecutive random values.  You will not see the IterationTag interface implemented often because  its subinterface, javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.BodyTag, offers the ability  to iterate and manipulate the body content if necessary. If iterating through  the body is not necessary, a support class implements all the necessary  methods of this interface and makes coding a tag much easier. We will cover  that topic later, in “Support Classes.” For now, let’s take a close look at the  BodyTag interface.  The javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.BodyTag interface extends the  IterationTag interface and adds the capability to evaluate and alter the  body content multiple times. As you know, the body content is the logic  between an extension’s opening and closing tags. This functionality is made  possible with the addition of the following methods:   cid:2  public void setBodyContent BodyContent bodyContent     cid:2  public void doInitBody   throws JspException  The setBodyContent BodyContent bodyContent  method is called by  the container to provide the tag a handle to the body content. It is invoked  after the doStartTag   because the opening tag must first be evaluated to  determine whether to execute or skip the body. The bodyContent object is  a critical feature for BodyTag handlers. It is important to understand how  this object works in order to get your output to display correctly.  With basic JSPs, output is written to the response stream by using the   JspWriter out implicit variable. Until now, we too have written directly  to the out variable by using the pageContext method getOut  . This  approach works well when you need to write either a String, int, or char   BodyTag Interface   382 Chapter 10  cid:2  Using Custom Tags  value to the stream. However, when the goal is to manipulate a tag’s body  content and then write its information to the response stream, the standard  out object falls short. To accomplish this task, you must first write to the tag’s  bodyContent object. The class actually extends the JspWriter class, and  is therefore a buffered writer. But what distinguishes it from its parent class is  that it contains the tag’s evaluated body content. From the bodyContent  object, you can extract the body and manipulate its content. When you are  ready to display your results, the bodyContent object must be written to the  implicit out response stream. To understand how the container handles  the body content, look at the following JSP code:            This is the body   When the container reads the syb:grandparent tag, it executes the  tag’s doStartTag   method. This method creates a new bodyContent  writer instance specifically for this tag. The implicit out variable is then  redirected to the instance for future use. When the body is evaluated,  the contents are transferred to the bodyContent object. After a body  content instance is initialized, you can invoke any one of the following  methods on it:   cid:2  public void clearBody     cid:2  public abstract String getString     cid:2  public abstract Reader getReader     cid:2  public JspWriter getEnclosingWriter     cid:2  public abstract void writeOut Writer out   As you can see, you can clear the body, read from it, or call getString    to convert the contents to a String and return its value. The last two methods  are important, because they are used to alter the content.  When you specifically write to the bodyContent instance, you are not   writing to the implicit out located on the bottom of the stack. Instead, you  must access the outer-layer stream by calling getEnclosingWriter  . This  method returns a JspWriter, which is the implicit out variable if your tag  is an outer tag. The term outer tag  means the custom action is not nested  within another action. If it is nested, then you write your body content to the  enclosing outer tag’s body content. The task of sending the current body    Tag Handler 383  content to the enclosing writer is handled by the writeOut …  method. This  method writes the content of the calling bodyContent instance to the  Writer object parameter. The parameter you pass is usually the result  of a call to getEnclosingWriter  .  The implicit out object can be accessed by most JSP actions by using the  method pageContext.getOut  . The problem with accessing the out object  directly is that custom tags need to access their body content and manipulate  that data before sending it back to the response stream. A basic JspWriter  does not offer such functionality. In addition, by writing directly to the  pageContext.getOut  , anything that is currently in the buffer can be poten- tially overwritten.   The way data is written to the response stream is especially critical and   essential for handling tags that are nested. Nested tags are tags within  another tag. Consider the following JSP example, in which pc stands for the  pageContext object:                                                          The code consists of three nested tags. The child tag is within the parent  tag, and the parent tag is within the grandparent tag. The problem is that  there is only one implicit out variable to which all tags must eventually for- ward their output. To prevent potential overwrites, each tag has its own  bodyContent object. When the container accesses the opening tag, it calls  the action’s doStartTag   method, which causes the pageContext to call  its pushBody   method. This method creates a new bodyContent object for  that particular tag. With each tag owning its own bodyContent or JspWriter,  your first instinct might be to have the tag write directly to its own  bodyContent object. That, however, fails to work. The implicit out is  located at the bottom of the stack, whereas each additional bodyContent  writer is stacked one on top of the other. If you opt to writeOut …  to the  current bodyContent, then the output will not be sent to the implicit out    384 Chapter 10  cid:2  Using Custom Tags  stream. Instead, it will be sent to itself. The following code sample demon- strates this concept:  JspWriter jspOut = getBodyContent  ; bodyContent.writeOut jspOut ;  The method getBodyContent   is available within the BodyTagSupport class.  It returns the current body content instance. If you are implementing the  BodyTag interface, a handle to the body content should be saved locally when  the setBodyContent BodyContent bodyContent  method is invoked by the  container. We will discuss the support class in more detail later.  This example writes the contents of the current bodyContent into the   current bodyContent writer jspOut. The implicit out variable is never  accessed, and the stream is left empty. Basically, this example accomplishes  nothing because it writes itself to itself.  When you call getEnclosingWriter  , you access the enclosing action’s   bodyContent object or JspWriter. If tags are nested, then each will call  getEnclosingWriter   and access their outer tag writer, concatenating  their information to the previous buffered data. Eventually, you’ll reach the  outermost layer and write the buffered stream to the response stream. The  correct way to write output is as follows:  JspWriter bcOut = bodyContent.getEnclosingWriter  ; bodyContent.write “…data… ” ; bodyContent.writeOut bcOut ;  If this code snippet is run as an outer tag, then bcOut is actually the   implicit JspWriter out variable. If the tag is executed as a nested tag, then  the bcOut variable is actually the outer tag’s bodyContent.   Given the earlier nested example, the child tag must call   getEnclosingWriter   to access the content of the parent; the parent tag  will then call getEnclosingWriter   to get the grandparent tag’s content  writer. Finally, the grandparent calls getEnclosingWriter   to gain  access to the implicit out object writer, which transfers information to the  response stream. Figure 10.5 shows how nested tags eventually access  the response stream in comparison to a single tag.  When a stack of writers exists, the getEnclosingWriter   method   ensures that you concatenate current data with the parent’s data to eventu- ally output all data to the response stream.

This is done when the   method  is called. Its purpose is to process code that should be taken care of before the  body of the  method is called next to determine whether the body should be reevaluated.  After there is no longer a need to iterate through the body, the    doEndTag   method is invoked. Finally, before the   handler is sent to the garbage col- lector, the   method is called to release any unnecessary resources.

First, we need to define the tag in the tag library descriptor:        loop       tagext.LoopTag                       iterations           true      JSP   Tag Handler 387           true           java.lang.Integer          Notice that we define the body-content with the default value JSP. This  tells the container to evaluate the body of the action at runtime. If you would  rather have the action  determine whether to evaluate the body, you can  define the content type as tagdependent. Finally, to force the body to be  empty, simply define the content as empty.  With this tag in place, we can now make the following call within our   JSP page:        Test 1               Test 2          The code for the described tag is shown in Listing 10.5. You will notice  that the doStartTag   method has an option to return the constant EVAL_ BODY_BUFFERED. When the constant is returned, a bodyContent object is  created to capture the evaluated body.   If EVAL_BODY_INCLUDE is returned, the setBodyContent ...  and doInitBody    methods are not invoked. Instead, the body is evaluated and “passed  through” to the current out. The doAfterBody   method then invoked the  number of necessary iterations, until finally the doEndTag   is invoked.”  Listing 10.5: Utilizing the BodyTag Interface  package tagext;  import java.io.*; import javax.servlet.jsp.*; import javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.*;  public class LoopTag implements BodyTag {     private PageContext pageContext;     private BodyContent bodyContent;   388 Chapter 10  cid:2  Using Custom Tags      private Tag parent;     private int iterations;      public void setPageContext PageContext pageContext  {         this.pageContext = pageContext;     }      public void setParent Tag parent  {         this.parent = parent;     }      public void setIterations int iterations  {         this.iterations = iterations;     }      public int doStartTag   throws JspException {         if iterations>0  {             return EVAL_BODY_BUFFERED;         } else {             return SKIP_BODY;         }     }        public void setBodyContent BodyContent bodyContent  {        this.bodyContent = bodyContent;     }      public void doInitBody   throws JspException {}          public int doAfterBody   throws JspException {        if iterations > 0  {           iterations--;           return EVAL_BODY_AGAIN;        } else {           try {             if bodyContent != null  {               JspWriter out=                  bodyContent.getEnclosingWriter  ;   Tag Handler 389                bodyContent.writeOut out ;               }                    } catch  IOException e  {               throw new JspException  ;           }           return SKIP_BODY;         }     }      public int doEndTag   throws JspException {        return EVAL_PAGE;     }     public void release   {}      public Tag getParent   {         return this.parent;     } } The point of this code is to determine whether the tag has a body. If it   does, then the doAfterTag   method extracts the contents and writes it out  to the bodyContent. The iteration counter is decremented and checked to  determine whether to repeat the behavior in the doAfterBody   method.  By the time a tag’s doEndTag   method is invoked, the container might have  already reused the body content instance. Consequently, you should not use  the bodyContent object in the doEndTag   method; instead, it should be han- dled within the doAfterBody   method.  The bodyContent object is flushed when the highest-level parent object  sim- ilar to the Object class  clears its buffer. The highest-level parent object would  be a tag that is not nested within any other tag. When that object calls  writeOut … , the buffer is flushed.  Ultimately, the code example produces the following output: Test 1 Test 2   390 Chapter 10  cid:2  Using Custom Tags  Support Classes  Test 2 Test 1 Test 2 Test 2 A common use for the IterationTag or BodyTag is to extract data from   a java.sql.ResultSet object returned from a database call. With each  iteration, the current record is extracted in some standard format, which is  defined within the body content.  Depending on the task at hand, you can implement any one of these  three interfaces. To simplify matters, however, a few support classes are  provided to limit the number of methods you have to define when creating  a custom tag.  To reduce the amount of redundant work and provide additional functionality,  support classes are made available. The API provides a variety of support  classes; we will cover three that most closely pertain to the exam objectives.   Two of the three classes implement the Tag interfaces and define the   methods for the developer. They include:  javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.TagSupport is used for basic tags that do not  manipulate the tag’s body.   javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.BodyTagSupport is used for tags that intend  to make changes to the tag’s body content. Although these classes  implement the methods of the interface, the most commonly used  methods are written with limited functionality. This encourages the  developer to override the intended method to define custom behav- ior. In addition to making tag extensions easier to write, the classes  also provide a few supplementary methods to expand the tag’s  capabilities.   The third support class is used to provide additional information to   the tag:  javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.TagExtraInfo is provided by the tag library  author to describe additional translation-time information not  described in the TLD.  In this section, we will discuss these three classes as they are often used   when creating custom tags.   Tag Handler 391  The TagSupport Class   The javax.serlvet.jsp.tagext.TagSupport class implements the  IterationTag interface, granting it the standard Tag life-cycle. The class is  also able to iterate through the tag body multiple times, without making  changes to the body. This utility class is considered the base class , which  offers basic functionality for new tag handlers. Because all the life-cycle  methods are implemented, they have default return values that you should  know. Table 10.5 defines those defaults.  T A B L E 1 0 . 5 Default Return Values for TagSupport Tags  Method  Default Return Value  doStartTag    SKIP_BODY  doAfterBody    SKIP_BODY  doEndTag    EVAL_PAGE  In addition to defining the standard interface methods, the TagSupport  class offers two instance variables and some convenience methods for greater  functionality. The variables are as follows:  protected String id is a value that can be assigned to the tag for future  reference.   protected PageContext pageContext provides the tag with access to  the JSP page implicit objects, such as the JspWriter object out, or the  HttpSession object, known as session.  Because the Tag interface method setPageContext …  is now defined  for you, the pageContext variable must be accessible to the class. The id  variable is defined by using a method called setId …  and indirectly acces- sible by using the getId   method.   Another feature of the TagSupport class is its capability to maintain a col- lection of values. A tag value  is any java.lang.Object with an associated  String key. This concept is similar to a java.util.Map. You can set and get  the value of a tag by using the following TagSupport methods:   cid:2  public Object getValue String key    cid:2  public java.util.Enumeration getValues     392 Chapter 10  cid:2  Using Custom Tags   cid:2  public void removeValue String key    cid:2  public void setValue String key, Object o    As with a java.util.Map, you set the value of the tag by passing a unique   key and the value itself. Internally, the TagSupport class maintains a  Collection of values that you can enumerate by using the getValue …   method. Because you can add values, you can also remove them by identify- ing the object you intend to eliminate via its key.  In addition to the previous methods defined, one other convenience   method is available to this class. It is static and used to help tags coordinate  with one another. Its signature is as follows:   cid:2  public static final Tag findAncestorWithClass Tag from,   java.lang.Class class   Sometimes you might need the help of an outer tag to resolve a problem   with a current nested tag. You can get the handle to any parental tags  from within a tag by using either the getParent   method or by calling  findAncestorWithClass … . The method getParent   returns only your  immediate parent. In contrast, the findAncestorWithClass …  method  enables multiple-layer subtags to acquire a handle to any outer ancestral tag  class. This method takes two arguments. The first parameter is the Tag handle  from which you want the container to begin its search for the target class.  The second parameter is the target java.lang.Class whose Tag handle you  are requesting.   The findAncestorWithClass …  method is used to return a handle to   an ancestor tag class that is nested. For example:                          Body                It is related to nesting tags within the JSP page, not a parental hierarchy. Consider the following code example: public int doStartTag   throws JspException {     Class className= com.company.TagName.class;   Tag Handler 393      Tag ancestor = TagSupport.findAncestorWithClass this,       className ;     TagSupport ts =  TagSupport ancestor;     ServletRequest req = pageContext.getRequest  ;     ts.setValue “quantity”, req.getParameter “qty”  ;   return SKIP_BODY; } Imagine that the example’s doStartTag   method exists within a   tag that is nested within several other tags. The com.company.TagName .class is a great-great-great grandparent class. Given such a scenario, the  findAncestorWithClass …  method will return a handle to that relative— allowing the current tag to modify a parameter value. In contrast, the method  getParent   will return only the immediate enclosing tag class.  In order for the findAncestorWithClass …  method to locate a parental rela- tive, the child tag must be nested within the parent tag in the JSP page. In  addition, the parent tag cannot evaluate its body.  The findAncestorWithClass …  method can be called within any tag  handler method. Because the method is static, the handler class does not need  to subclass TagSupport. A Tag instance is returned, so if the ancestral class  is of a different data type, you must cast it in order to access the class’s methods  or instance variables.  When subsequent tags need to pass information or get information   from a parental relative, they can use the Tag handle to access its attribute  methods.   The BodyTagSupport Class   The javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.BodyTagSupport class extends the  TagSupport class and implements the BodyTag interface. The design pro- vides the BodyTagSupport class the added features of the TagSupport class  and the capability to modify the body of the extension as defined by the  BodyTag interface. This support class provides an iteration life cycle with the  capability to alter the body context that exists between the opening and clos- ing tags. It also can add and remove tag values.   In addition to the standard methods and variables defined by its inherited  class and interfaces, the BodyTagSupport class offers a new instance variable    394 Chapter 10  cid:2  Using Custom Tags  and some convenience methods to access the bodyContext and the sur- rounding JspWriter. The new variable is as follows:  protected BodyContent bodyContent provides a handle to the data  that exists between the opening and closing tag elements.  In addition to the new variable, the class also adds the following two   methods:   cid:2  public BodyContent getBodyContent     cid:2  public JspWriter getPreviousOut    Because the support class defines the setBodyContent …  method,  accessing the BodyContent object can be done either by accessing the  instance variable bodyContent or by using the accessor method  getBodyContent  .   The other method, getPreviousOut  , saves you the hassle of first   accessing the bodyContent object to then get the enclosing JspWriter. So  instead of calling  JspWriter out= getBodyContent  .getEnclosingWriter  ;  you can simply call  JspWriter out = getPreviousOut  ; Again, this is simply a convenience method that provides access to the   enclosing tag’s writer. Given the potential for nested tags, this approach ensures  that writing done in an inner tag will be concatenated to the outer tag’s output.   Because the BodyTagSupport class extends the TagSupport class and   provides implementation for the BodyTag interface, it offers the most default  custom tag functionality. As a result, it is used most often when creating cus- tom tags that utilize their body content. If we revisit the code for LoopTag,  you can see how the code is greatly simplified; see Listing 10.6.  Listing 10.6: Utilizing the BodyTagSupport Class  package tagext;  import java.io.*; import javax.servlet.jsp.*; import javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.*;  public class LoopTag extends BodyTagSupport {     private int iterations;   Tag Handler 395      public void setIterations int value  {         this.iterations = value;     }      public int doAfterBody   throws JspException {         if iterations>1 {            iterations--;            return EVAL_BODY_BUFFERED;         } else {            try {               if bodyContent != null  {                   bodyContent.writeOut getPreviousOut   ;               }            } catch  IOException e  {               throw new JspException  ;            }            return SKIP_BODY;         }     } } In this example, you should notice a few things. First, there is no need   to define the standard set methods of the tag and its subclassing interfaces.  Second, we use the bodyContent variable directly because it is available  from the BodyTagSupport class. Finally, we call getPreviousOut   instead  of using the bodyContent object to access the enclosing out variable.  The TagExtraInfo Class  Until now, we have shown you one way for a JSP page to access attribute  values. When an action tag declares the value for an attribute, the JSP page  can utilize the variable directly if a setXXX …  attribute method is defined.  Listings 10.5 and 10.6 use the iterations variable, which is passed from the  JSP page. After the setParent …  method is invoked, the container calls  the setIterations …  method, passing in the attribute value from the JSP  page. Although this approach is effective, it requires the tag to individually  define each and every attribute in the tag library descriptor. In addition, you  are unable to specify the scope of the attribute. Instead, the attribute is avail- able for the life of the action.   396 Chapter 10  cid:2  Using Custom Tags  Another approach is available that provides more flexibility and manage- able code  meaning you can create an action with 100 variables without  having a huge TLD . By extending the abstract class TagExtraInfo and  overriding one or two of its methods, you can provide a list of variables with  differing scopes to the JSP page and scriptlets that the action might utilize.  To create this list, you must override the first method in the list below. The  second method is optional and simply adds greater functionality:   cid:2  public VariableInfo[] getVariableInfo TagData data    cid:2  public boolean isValid TagData data   The container invokes the getVariableInfo   method when attributes  for the action are requested. A TagData instance is passed to the method con- taining translation time attribute value pair information defined within the  JSP page. Consider the following code:        Welcome to our site      In this example, the TagData object would contain a String key called  name with an associated value Chris Cook. It acts like a java.util.Map by  holding a collection of objects, which are accessible through their String  key values. When overriding the getVariableInfo   method, you can use the  TagData handle to call the getAttribute String name  method and pass  in the name of the attribute to acquire its value. The class ProfileTagInfo  demonstrates how the method can be overridden.  public class ProfileTagInfo extends TagExtraInfo {    public VariableInfo[] getVariableInfo TagData data  {       return new VariableInfo[] {          new VariableInfo               data.getAttribute “name” ,   variable’s name              “java.lang.String”,     variable’s data type              true,                   True means variable                                      is new              VariableInfo.NESTED     scope                  };    } }                                                                                             Tag Handler  397  Creating a   VariableInfo   object requires passing in four parameters to its  constructor. The first is the name of the variable. To prevent runtime errors  or unexpected results, the name of each variable should be unique, because it  is the name of the actual attribute. The second argument is the fully qualifying  , a new variable is created  class name. The third is a  by the action and declared within the translated servlet. The variable overrides  the value of an existing variable if necessary. A   declaration means the  variable already exists. The last argument is an  scope of the variable.

AT_END   398 Chapter 10  cid:2  Using Custom Tags  The second method that is commonly overridden, but optional, provides  elegance to the action’s attribute. The isValid   method is used to validate  the attributes passed to a tag at translation time. It receives a TagData instance,  which can be used to filter out unacceptable values. For example, you might  accept only certain object types or numbers within a particular range. The  default implementation returns a true for all attributes. If configured to return  false, it is still the developer’s responsibility to utilize the attribute correctly.   Now that we’ve shown you how to create the list of variables, we will   show you how to link the variables to the JSP page. The process begins with  the container. When it comes across a variable within a scriptlet, it attempts  to locate the value by looking to the tag library descriptor. An instance of the  implementing class of TagExtraInfo is available by using the tei-class  element to define it. Let’s take a look at an example:                  profile            ProfileTag           ProfileTagInfo           JSP                         name               true               true                  The container locates the class and loads it into memory. At that point, all  the variables are available by mapping the JSP variable name to the variable’s  key name.   In our example, we defined the scope of the variable name as NESTED.   That works fine when we want to use the variable within scriptlets located  inside nested actions. If, however, the scope is defined as AT_END, the vari- able must be saved to the JSP’s PageContext. Remember, the pageContext  object is one of the first objects set within the page. It lasts for the life of the  page and can hold attributes. Consider the following code:  public int doEndTag   throws JspException {    pageContext.setAttribute “name”, “Sasha” ;    return EVAL_PAGE; }   Summary  Summary 399  In this example, the attribute name is accessible from within a JSP page  after the closing tag for this action is read. If the scope for the variable were  AT_BEGIN, you would need to associate it to the pageContext before the  doStartTag   method. Fundamentally, it is important to know that  attribute variables defined within the PageContext are accessible from  within the JSP page and embedded scriptlets.  The pageContext object is a major resource for storing and accessing vari- ables. It contains handles to implicit objects and page attributes.  Utilizing the TagExtraInfo class provides a clean way to incorporate a  significant number of attributes into an action. The attributes can be used  from within the custom tag class, the action itself, and scriptlets.  In this chapter, we covered the topics needed to understand custom   tags. We began by discussing custom tag fundamentals, including the ways  to call a custom tag and the elements that are necessary within the JSP and  web.xml file in order to locate the tag library. We discussed how to create a  tag library descriptor file, which maintains all the tags and their attributes.  Finally, this left us with the core behind custom tags—the actual action or  tag class.  The unique features of each interface and class that utilize the parent Tag   interface were addressed. Although most people will always use support  classes to create their tags, the exam tests your knowledge of the behaviors  and semantics of each method, which depend somewhat on the ancestral  class being utilized. For example, the return type of the doStartTag    method is different if your class extends BodyTagSupport versus any other  class or interface. We emphasized the details associated with each Tag inter- face to ensure a thorough understanding of the Tag, IterationTag, and  BodyTag life cycles. Each interface serves a slightly different purpose and should  be utilized accordingly.  We also covered the importance and role that the pageContext plays in  a custom tag by providing access to the application’s implicit variables and  TagExtraInfo attributes. Finally, we covered the impact of the bodyContent  and how to effectively write information out to the client.   400 Chapter 10  cid:2  Using Custom Tags  Exam Essentials  Be able to format tag library declarations in the web application  deployment descriptor. The deployment descriptor uses the taglib  element to identify the URI name, or taglib-uri, used by the JSP page  to then locate the actual tag library by using the taglib-location  element.           taglib.tld                WEB-INF taglib.tld          Be able to identify taglib directives in a JSP page. You can use the  taglib directive within a JSP page to notify the container of the tag  library you are interested in utilizing. The uri attribute maps to the  taglib-uri identified in the web.xml document. The prefix attribute is  used to call the tag from within the page.     Be able to identify properly formatted custom tag usage in a JSP page. A custom tag is defined by a prefix value, a colon, and the name of the  action. Attributes are optional and can be listed within the opening tag.  Nesting tags within the body of another tag is also acceptable.  Be able to identify the general tag library descriptor elements. A cus- tom tag must be embedded within its own set of    elements.  Nested within are the name, tag-class, and body-content elements  used to define the tag’s calling name, fully qualifying class name, and iden- tifier to notify the server about how to handle the tag’s body.        theDate     DateTag     JSP    …     Exam Essentials 401  Be able to identify attribute tag library descriptor elements. Each tag  can have multiple attributes to help provide greater flexibility to the  extension. Nested within the tag element, you will usually find attribute  information, such as its name, an indication of whether it is required, an  indication of whether the value can by dynamically determined within  an expression, and the data type.            age          false          true          java.lang.Integer     Be able to identify valid values for the body content TLD element. The body-content element has three valid types: JSP, tagdependent,  and empty. JSP notifies the container that it should evaluate the tag’s  body, whereas tagdependent tells the container to pass the body through  to the action class so that the class can determine what to do with the  body. Finally, empty means the tag cannot have a body.

JSP  B. servlet  C. tagdependent  D. empty   408 Chapter 10  cid:2  Using Custom Tags  Answers to Review Questions  1. D.  The first option is valid because a forward slash simply means the  URI is relative to the context path. The second option utilizes an absolute  path, which is acceptable as well. The third option defines a page- relative path, meaning the taglib file is relative to the current JSP  page or file. Finally, the last option fails because there is no address  attribute, and a tag-uri path cannot be defined in that fashion.  2. E.  The uri attribute defines the path within the web.xml file to locate  the TLD file. The prefix is also mandatory and denotes the short- name used to identify which library the custom tag is associated with.  3. A.  An empty tag has no body. The easiest way to write the tag is to   provide only an opening tag.   4. D.  The life cycle is very close to that of the BodyTag; however,   one step is missing. After a call to the doStartTag   method, the  setBodyContent bodyContent  method is invoked. After that  completes, the doInitBody   is called.  5. A, B.  The doStartTag   is invoked early in the life of a JSP. If it  returns an EVAL_BODY_BUFFERED or EVAL_BODY_INCLUDE, then the  doInitBody   method will run one time. If, however, it returns a  SKIP_BODY variable, the doInitBody   method is not executed. The  doEndTag   is also executed once. When it is determined that the  body will no longer be evaluated, the doEndTag   method is invoked.  6. C.  When the doStartTag   method is called, it will evaluate the body  if EVAL_BODY_INCLUDE is returned. When the doAfterBody   method  is called, a return value of EVAL_BODY_AGAIN must be returned.  7. D.  The tei-class is used to help the container load an array of   attributes for the action to utilize.  8. A.  The second option is false because it assumes that the body is   always evaluated. If the doStartTag   returns a SKIP_BODY value, the  doInitBody   method is not invoked. The third option fails as well. It  too assumes the doAfterBody   method is always called. Again, if the  body is not evaluated, neither is the doAfterBody   method.  9. C.  Regardless of the tag interface, a return value of SKIP_BODY will  cause the doEndTag   to be invoked next. The first two options are  invoked only if a body is evaluated for certain custom tags.   Answers to Review Questions 409  10. C.  The first and last options are valid return values only if the tag   handler subclasses BodyTagSupport. For a TagSupport implementa- tion, the default value for the doStartTag   method is SKIP_BODY.  11. D.  The first option fails because the JspWriter class does not have  a write method that accepts a JspWriter as a parameter. The second  option fails for similar reasons. The method getEnclosingWriter    does not take any parameters. Finally, the last option fails because the  write method returns a void instead of a JspWriter object, which is  what writeOut …  expects.  12. A, B.  The first option is legal because it uses the bodyContent object   to get the enclosing action’s output stream. The second option is  merely an abbreviation of the first. It is a helper method that takes one  step rather than two. The third option fails because the bodyContent  object is an OutputStream and does not provide a getOut   method  to access embedded streams.   13. B.  The element tag-class is used to define the fully qualifying tag   class name.  14. B.  Implicit objects are not directly accessible. You must use the   pageContext variable to acquire these objects. This leaves both B and  C as options. C fails because SKIP_PAGE is not a valid return for the  doStartTag   method.  15. B.  The term servlet is not legal. JSP signifies that the container should   evaluate the action’s body, whereas tagdependent suggests it should  not. If empty is defined, then a body cannot be used.                                 Chapter  11  Web Tier Design  Patterns  THE FOLLOWING SUN CERTIFIED WEB  COMPONENT DEVELOPER FOR J2EE  PLATFORM EXAM OBJECTIVES COVERED  IN THIS CHAPTER:   cid:1    cid:1   13.1 Given a scenario description with a list of issues, select  the design pattern  Value Object, MVC, Data Access Object,  or Business Delegate  that would best solve those issues.  13.2 Match design patterns with statements describing  potential benefits that accrue from the use of the pattern,  for any of the following patterns:   cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2   Value Object MVC Data Access Object Business Delegate                          T  he development of an application is often sparked by the need  to resolve a particular problem. The decisions behind resolving that problem  are usually influenced by cost, time, and functionality; the order of priority  usually depends on the project. The difficulty, however, is that for every  problem, there are multiple solutions. Depending on existing variables and  long-term desires, a solution can vary from situation to situation.  Design patterns   offer a proven “cookbook” answer to resolve the problem   while managing various extraneous issues. There are many books on this  topic alone, defining more than 30 patterns, but we will cover only four as  they pertain to the J2EE model and the Sun Certified Web Component  Developer for J2EE Platform exam:   cid:2    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2   Value Object pattern  Data Access Object pattern  Business Delegate pattern  Model View Controller pattern  We will define the behaviors of each pattern and identify ways to distin-  guish one from another. We will also cover the advantages and disadvantages  of each pattern. Our goal is to ensure that you have a thorough understand- ing of each pattern and the knowledge necessary to answer scenario- and  benefit-based questions.  Before we jump into discussing each pattern, you need to have an under-  standing of the major components utilized within the J2EE architecture.  Figure 11.1 displays each tier and its purpose.  Until now, we have discussed the Presentation tier and the Web tier; how- ever, we’ve neglected the Server tier, which manages all Enterprise Java Beans,  or EJBs. Although the exam does not test your knowledge of these components,  a general discussion of the Server tier will help clarify each design pattern.

Contained within an application server, EJBs are Java  Java Beans  EJBs  classes that implement business services and rely on the server to manage  their life cycle and architectural services such as security, transaction man- agement, and persistent data storage, to name a few. A Java  application   is a vendor product that, at a minimum, adheres to the EJB speci- server fication to provide support for the various forms of EJBs. To understand  the benefits of certain design patterns, you must first have a general under- standing of EJBs.  In this section, we will explain the purpose and functionality of the two  main types: entity beans and session beans. After you understand how each  component behaves, we will begin our discussion on J2EE design patterns.  Entity Beans An  man’s terms, this means it is a special Java class that manages the inserts,    is a transactional object that represents persistent data. In lay-  entity bean                                       414  Chapter 11  cid:2   Web Tier Design Patterns  get  updates, deletes, and selects from a database for a particular record. Usually,  each entity bean represents a record in a single table or multiple tables. Each  entity class contains data representing the attributes from the database  tables. Using an entity’s  or session bean  can request information from the entity. When an entity  bean is invoked, it usually results in a query or change to the associated data- base. Because entity beans are pooled to improve efficiency, they have a  many-to-many relationship with the client. This means that multiple clients  can access more than one entity bean of the same kind. Figure 11.2 shows  where entities fit into the J2EE architecture.   or accessor methods, a servlet  or client,   XXX      F I G U R E 1 1 . 2  Entity beans  Application server  Session  Session  Session  Entity  Entity  Entity  Entity  Pool  Database  In the image, you see each entity bean communicating with the database.  Usually, application servers provide a connection-pooling mechanism to  reduce the number of unnecessary connections; pooling enables a system  to service a larger population with few instances  or connections . The result  is an increase in performance.  Performance is also influenced by the design of the entity bean itself.  Because each database call is potentially remote, reducing the number of  unnecessary calls will improve the application’s performance. Consider the  scenario of an entity providing a “get” method to return each data field asso- ciated to a record. The client would need to make multiple requests to retrieve  a single record. Assuming each call is remote, this approach utilizes excessive  bandwidth—resulting in inefficiency. appropriate   design pattern could improve the effi- ciency of an entity. Before we discuss pattern options, we will first address  session beans.

These services are usu- ally task oriented. For example, you might have a   session bean  that provides a method to locate available flights or book a flight.   generally do not modify the database.   TravelAgent  To accomplish a particular task, a session bean usually employs the help  of entity beans. Figure 11.3 shows how a session uses entities to communi- cate with the database.

Going back   example, the act of booking a flight entails the follow-  TravelAgent  to our  ing process:  1.  2.  3.  Acquire available flights.  Reserve flight with client’s information.  Charge client’s credit card.  At least two entity beans could be used to handle the airline and client   information. After the transaction is complete, the client receives the neces- sary confirmation data, which might include the flight number, the time of  departure, the cost, and so on.  There are several approaches a developer could take to provide the client  with all their flight information. The first requires the application to make  multiple requests to obtain each individual field item associated to the trip;  the second simply has the application request a single object containing                                                                                             416  Chapter 11  cid:2   Web Tier Design Patterns  Value Object Pattern  all the necessary flight information. Because the second approach utilizes  less bandwidth, resulting in one network call instead of many, the applica- tion’s performance increases. This particular technique utilizes the common  design pattern called the Value Object pattern.  Now that you have a basic understanding of the role that both session and  entity beans play in the J2EE architecture, we can discuss the Value Object  and other patterns used to improve an enterprise application’s performance,  maintainability, and expandability.  T   cid:2    cid:2    cid:2   he   Value Object pattern   is designed to reduce the number of method   calls a client must make to obtain information.

A copy is then  sent to the client—which can use its copy of the value object to extract data  from the instance.

Get value  Whether you allow the user to set values in a value object is influenced by  the pattern strategy you choose to implement. The exam requires that you  know how to identify a value object. Consequently, you should be familiar  with how the pattern is used. There are four defined strategies for this pattern.  The first creates a value object whose attributes can be changed. The second  enables a bean to create and utilize more than one value object. The third has  the entity bean extend the value object. Finally, the fourth is the most com- plex; it allows the entity bean to inherit from more than one value object.  In the remainder of this section, we’ll describe each strategy and then discuss  the pros and cons of the Value Object pattern as a whole.  Updateable  or Mutable  Value Object   members is con- A value object that has “set” or mutator methods or  sidered  updateable Updateable  or Mutable  Value Object   is utilized when you want the client to be able to change its value  strategy object instance. There are three ways to create mutable value objects; their  class can supply any one or a combination of the following features:  mutable  public  . The   , or    cid:2    cid:2    cid:2   public   variables  Constructors  “Set” methods                       418  Chapter 11  cid:2   Web Tier Design Patterns  Generally there are two common approaches. The first uses both public   variables and constructors to create the value object. For example:  public class Ticket {   public double cost;   public Date purchaseDate;    public Ticket   {}   public Ticket double cost, Date purchaseDate  {     this.cost = cost;     this.purchaseDate = purchaseDate;   }      } The second approach enables the user to change its private data through   the use of constructor or “set” methods:  public class Ticket {   private double cost;   private Date purchaseDate;    public Ticket   {}    public Ticket double cost, Date purchaseDate  {     this.cost = cost;     this.purchaseDate = purchaseDate;   }        public void setCost double cost  {     this.cost = cost;   }   public void setDate Date purchaseDate  {     this.purchaseDate = purchaseDate;   }   public double getCost   {     return this.cost;   }   public Date getDate   {     return this.purchaseDate;   } }                                                   Value Object Pattern  419  Either approach is acceptable and used depending on security and memory   requirements.   There is one other consideration. Sometimes value objects are amazingly  complex and have a large number of “set” methods. In such cases, it might  be beneficial to include a    method to set all values at once.  setData …   … public void setData double cost, Date purchaseDate  {   this.cost = cost;   this.purchaseDate = purchaseDate; } …  Some books suggest passing in an instance of your value object to the  setData  because it merely causes the user to go through an extra step. Creating a new  instance ultimately provides no additional benefits.  . We choose not to recommend this approach   ValueObject  obj        setData …   A call to the    method simply causes all attributes to change in  one step. By providing a  setData …  method within the value object, you  reduce the number of calls a client needs to make if they intend to make mul- tiple changes to the object’s data. After the value object is configured to an  acceptable state, it can be passed to an entity or session bean to update some  other source.  On a basic level, this is quite a simple design and strategy. It gets more   complex when a single EJB utilizes more than one value object.  It is quite feasible that either an entity or session bean will utilize more than  one value object. Imagine a Bank bean that provides information to all your  accounts. The bean provides client information, checking, savings, and money  market history, and more. Each category could warrant a separate value  object. The Multiple Value Objects strategy enables the EJB to create associ- ated value objects with “get” methods to each referenced object. Figure 11.5  shows how a single EJB object can utilize multiple objects.  This strategy is quite common in complex application systems. In general,  session beans are more likely to use multiple value objects as they attempt to  accomplish multiple tasks to complete a process. In such cases, each task can  reference a separate value object.  Multiple Value Objects   420 Chapter 11  cid:2  Web Tier Design Patterns  F I G U R E 1 1 . 5 Multiple value objects associated with a single EJB  Client, servlet, or JSP  EJB object  Value object A  Value object B  Simple entity beans are less likely to use this strategy because they map  to a single record. If, however, a record contains fields that represent entire  records from other tables, then the entity will likely use multiple value objects.  If a Ticket value object references another value object, which represents  the type of ticket, then creating the object becomes a bit more complex. Con- sider the following:  public class Ticket {   private double cost;   private Date purchaseDate;   private Type ticketType;    public Ticket   {}    public Ticket double cost, Date purchaseDate,                 Type ticketType  {     this.cost = cost;     this.purchaseDate = purchaseDate;     this.ticketType = ticketType;   }   public Type getType  {     return this.ticketType;   }   … } For a client to create or modify the Ticket object, they must first create   or access the Type object.  When using this approach, it is critical that value objects are designed to be  granular but not too granular. If a value object is too large, and only a small  portion of its content is modified regularly, then you are unnecessarily trans- ferring a larger-than-needed object between client and server—causing traffic  and inefficiency.   Entity Inherits Value Object  Value Object Pattern 421  As its name indicates, the Entity Inherits Value Object strategy applies only to  entity beans. Its purpose is to eliminate code duplication by having an entity  bean extend the value object class. This means a value object is created when  an entity is instantiated. As soon as a client utilizes the entity, the container will  populate the entity with the necessary data values that represent the desired  record. Instead of storing the data directly in the entity class, the data is actu- ally inherited from the value object. Let’s revisit the basic Ticket example:  public class Ticket {   protected double cost;   protected Date purchaseDate;    public Ticket   {}    public Ticket double cost, Date purchaseDate  {     this.cost = t.cost;     this.purchaseDate = purchaseDate;   }        public void setCost double cost  {     this.cost = cost;   }   public void setDate Date purchaseDate  {     this.purchaseDate = purchaseDate;   }   public double getCost   {     return this.cost;   }   public Date getDate   {     return this.purchaseDate   } } If an entity bean extends this class, then it does not need to provide value   object logic:  public class TicketEJB extends Ticket      implements EntityBean {        mandatory entity methods        422 Chapter 11  cid:2  Web Tier Design Patterns      public Ticket getData double cost, Date purchaseDate  {       return new Ticket cost, purchaseDate ;     } } The design calls for the following method to be included in the entity bean: public ValueObject getData   {…} To obtain the value object reference, the client calls getData …  on the   entity bean. The bean, in turn, returns an instance of its superclass.   The benefits of this strategy are as follows:   cid:2  It eliminates code duplication within the entity and the value object   because data is stored in one location—the value object.   cid:2   It helps manage changes to the entity and value object because the   data exists in only one class rather than two.   The less appealing aspect of this strategy is the following:   cid:2  A change to a value object can affect all its subclasses.   Significant changes to an application’s hierarchy can be cumbersome. A  solution to this problem is to layer the Value Object Factory strategy on top  of this one.  The Entity Inherits Value Object strategy allows the entity bean to extend only  one value object. Yet the Multiple Value Objects strategy shows that an entity  bean can often utilize more than one value object. The Value Object Factory  strategy solves this problem. Through the use of interfaces, the Value Object  Factory strategy enables an entity to inherit from more than one value object.  The process consists of the following steps:  1. Create an interface for each value object.  2. Create a value object class to implement its respective interface.  3. Create a factory class with a constructor that takes the following   arguments:   cid:2  The entity bean instance intending to create the value object   cid:2  The interface that identifies which value object to create  4. Instantiate the factory from within the entity to create the needed   value objects.  Value Object Factory   Value Object Pattern 423  The following example breaks down each step by providing pseudo-code   samples of each piece required to create a value object factory.  Step 1—Create the interfaces:  public interface Ticket {   public void setCost double cost ;   public void setPurchaseDate Date purchaseDate ;   public double getCost  ;   public Date getDate  ; } public interface Airline {   public void setFlightNo int no ;   public int getFlightNo  ; }  Step 2—Implement the interfaces:  public class TicketVO implements Ticket {   private double cost;   private Date purchaseDate;         implement all the get and set methods }  public class AirlineVO implements Airline {   private int flightNo;       implement all the get and set methods  }  Step 3—Create the factory:  public class VoFactory {   public static final int TRIP =0;   public static final int CUSTOMER =1;   …    public VoFactory  EntityBean bean, int type  {     switch type {       case TRIP:   424 Chapter 11  cid:2  Web Tier Design Patterns          Field[] field =           bean.getClass  .getDeclaredFields  ;         for  int i=0; i< field.length; i++  {            …              use reflection to associate               bean instance to appropriate value objects         }         break;       case CUSTOMER:         …         break;     }   } }  Step 4—Create the client:  public class TripEJB implements EntityBean {   private Ticket ticket;   private Airline airline;    public TripEJB   {     VoFactory fact = new VoFactory this, VoFactory.TRIP ;   }    …    All mandatory entity bean methods }  With a handle to the entity bean, the factory class can instantiate all the  required value objects for the specific entity and assign it the bean’s attribute  values through reflection.   Although this approach offers expandability, flexibility, and maintain- ability benefits, it sacrifices performance due to the overhead involved in  using reflection to set the variables.  Advantages and Disadvantages   Depending on the project constraints and design goals, there are certain advan- tages and disadvantages you should consider when creating value objects.   Value Object Pattern 425  Advantages  Disadvantages  There are three main benefits associated with using value objects. They  reduce network traffic and code duplication, while protecting transactional  data blocks:  Reduces network traffic The Value Object pattern acts like a data car- rier and enables data to be passed between client and server by using one  remote method call. This improves network performance.  Reduces code duplication When an entity inherits from a value object,  there is no need to include attribute data within the entity. Instead, the  members are inherited. This results in reduced code duplication. If the Value  Object Factory strategy is utilized, then the same benefit occurs; however,  you face an increase in application complexity.  Enables concurrent access and transactions The EJB container offers  transaction isolation levels to help manage multiple access to the same  data. An isolation level defines the degree of strictness an application will  maintain for data access. By defining the correct isolation level, the integ- rity of a value object can be protected.  Unfortunately, poor use of design patterns can actually harm an application.  There are three potential problems that should be considered when utilizing  value objects. The first relates to maintaining stale data; the second is about  threading issues; and the third pertains to the effects of transferring large  objects over the network:   Updates propagation and stale value objects When a value object is  mutable, the client could be holding on to an instance that no longer  represents the current record state. Imagine multiple clients making  requests to the same record. If each client captures the same data and  one makes a change, all other clients will hold stale data. This could  have negative effects as further changes might not be warranted based  on the new values.  Creates synchronization and version control issues After an entity  bean modifies a record in the database, it must then save the new values  to its own set of attribute values. If more than one client simultaneously  makes an update to the same record, the bean could end up with incor- rect data. To solve this problem, the entity can synchronize the bean or    426 Chapter 11  cid:2  Web Tier Design Patterns  Data Access Object Pattern  value object to prevent more than one thread from accessing the same  record at a time. The other solution is to have the value object have a  time stamp and version number attribute. Thus the bean can determine  whether it has the latest update.  Decreases network performance Performance can decline if the data  shipped is very large. A value object provides the application with the  capability to transfer information by using one remote call instead of mul- tiple calls. The downside to this technique is that it causes larger amounts  of data to be shipped in one call. Depending on the object size, this can  sometimes be more of a problem than a benefit.   Behind every large and successful application is a strong information   storage system. Most web applications deal with stored data in one way or  another. Whether the data consists of inventory for purchasing, session  activity for client history, or static information to display, an application  eventually needs to write to or read information from some repository. The  problem is that the repository or data-storage mechanisms can vary greatly.  Many systems maintain data on mainframes, relational database manage- ment systems  RDBMS , object-oriented database management systems   OODBMS , LDAP repositories, flat files, and more.  One benefit the Java language offers is the ability to “write once, imple- ment anywhere.” Well, that phrase is only as effective as the developer writ- ing the code. Java Database Connectivity, or JDBC, is a common way Java  communicates with RDBMS databases. Making database calls is a prime  example of where the “implements anywhere” can fail.  Using the JDBC API, you can easily write code that will execute on any   JDBC-supported database. That is because the vendor implements the  defined interfaces, and you, the developer, use the standardized method  names and interfaces that compliant vendors define. The shortcoming,  however, occurs when you send a custom String value that represents a  database command  Structured Query Language, or SQL, statement  to  the driver. Some drivers will accept more complex statements, and others  accept only the basic. The end result is that you can write vendor-specific  code while using Java.   Data Access Object Pattern 427  Unfortunately, eliminating vendor dependence altogether usually comes  with a cost. Often that sacrifice is efficiency or flexibility. Because both are  important, a design pattern has emerged to provide both vendor flexibility  and the ability to seize the benefits a particular vendor can offer. The pattern  is called the Data Access Object  DAO  pattern. Adhering to the object- oriented principle of isolating object tasks, the pattern separates the logic  needed to communicate with the Enterprise Information Systems  EIS  into  its own class. This means a business object such as an entity or session bean,  or a servlet or JSP component, utilizes a data access object  DAO  to handle  all EIS-related transactions.  A business object is a client object that requires access to the data source in  order to obtain and store data.   Figure 11.6 diagrams the process.  F I G U R E 1 1 . 6 The Data Access Object diagram  Business object [client, entity, session servlet,  or JSP]  uses  Data access object  DAO   [void insert … , void delete … ,  void update … , etc.]  manages  Data source  [database, LDAP server,  flat file, credit card  bureau, etc.]  If your application utilizes a relational database, you might have separate  DAO objects to handle inserts, updates, deletes, and queries for each table,  value object, or entity bean. If a new data source is required, the DAO objects    428 Chapter 11  cid:2  Web Tier Design Patterns  are modified, leaving the business objects untouched. At a minimum, this  pattern requires the following three elements:   cid:2  A business object, utilizing each DAO interface and its methods to   communicate with the EIS tier   cid:2  A DAO class, providing the specific vendor implementation for   communication    cid:2  A data source, representing the data storage device  It is considered good coding practice to create an interface for each DAO  object. Business objects should utilize the interface name to minimize the  number of modifications necessary when a new DAO implementation is  provided.  You can utilize three implementation strategies to maximize the benefits  of this design pattern. The first is to simply hard-code the communication  logic for each method accessing the data source, the second is to use a mech- anism to automatically generate the data source communication code, and  the third is to create a factory class that handles the construction of each  DAO object. We will discuss each in detail.  When writing an entity bean, which normally maps to a database record,  you can handle the persistence data two ways: either the bean can provide  the SQL—this is known as Bean Managed Persistence  BMP , or the EJB  container can generate the SQL—this is known as Container Managed  Persistence  CMP .  With CMP beans, the container automatically services all persistent storage  access, so there is no need to use the Data Access Object design pattern.  If you write the SQL yourself, you are encouraged to create a separate   class that handles all this logic; this is known as the Basic DAO strategy. The  SQL class you create is actually your DAO object. Your bean can then call  the DAO object to use its methods and communicate to the database. Let’s   Basic Database Access Object   Data Access Object Pattern 429  consider a DAO object representing an airline object. Its pseudo-code might  look similar to the following interface and class:  public interface AirlineDAO {     public void insert String query ;     public void delete String query ;     public void update String query ; }  class AirlineDAOImpl implements AirlineDAO {     …     private AirlineDAOImpl String source  {           make connection     }     public static AirlineDAO getDAO String source  {         return new AirlineDAO  source ;     }     public void insert String sql  {     …     }     public void delete String sql  {     …     }     public void update String sql  {     …     }     … } In this example, we force the user to acquire an instance to the class by  using the static getDAO String source  method. By passing a qualifier,  such as a driver for a database or filename for a flat file, we generate the nec- essary connection in the constructor and pass a new handle to the client. If  the data source is changed, the DAO object will need to be modified, along  with one line of code used to obtain the DAO object in the business object.  By passing a new instance to each caller, we can protect against some thread- ing issues that could occur if more than one object shared access to this one  object.   430 Chapter 11  cid:2  Web Tier Design Patterns  Automatic Code Generated Data Access Object  While the Basic DAO strategy improves code management with respect to  the business object, the Automatic Code Generated Data Access Object  strategy eliminates the need to modify the DAO object in addition to the  business object.  The Automatic Code Generated Data Access Object strategy assumes  the use of a tool or technology to eliminate the need to manually write the  code of each DAO object. This technique can be used to investigate the  underlying system and create mappings between the information and  the DAO object to then generate the appropriate code. One example is the  Java reflection API, which uses introspection to dynamically determine  table names and fields that can be mapped to each access object. Another  example might be a tool that maps objects to relational databases. If you  are familiar with Container Managed Persistence for an entity bean, the  container provides such a device.  The benefit of this strategy is that it reduces the amount of code the devel- oper needs to generate. If changes to the DAO object are updated dynamically,  the client will probably experience a runtime delay the first time the instance  is created. The reason for the delay is that techniques such as introspection  and reflection take time up front.  The third strategy can utilize either the basic or automatic code generation  approach to generating the DAO. Its main focus, however, is to create a pool  of DAO objects that can easily be accessed from any data source without  requiring code modifications.  In Java terms, a factory is a class that creates instance variables for a   specific class type. The Factory for Data Access Object strategy is designed  to have a class provide DAO objects for a specific data source. An applica- tion calls on the factory to acquire a particular data source DAO instance.  When a new data source is introduced, it is added to the factory and made  available to the user through a static method call. Old code is not broken,  and new code has greater flexibility. For a single data source, the design  requires the following code pieces:   cid:2  A DAO factory interface, which defines the “create” methods for each   accessible data access method.  Factory for Data Access Object   Data Access Object Pattern 431   cid:2  A DAO factory class, which implements each factory interface method   to return an actual DAO object   cid:2  A DAO object, which is created by the factory and passed to the client   to handle data source management  To demonstrate the parts necessary to make this pattern come alive, we  are going to revisit the AirlineDAO data access object example. This time,  however, we are going to assume that the DAO object might reside in  different data sources.  Step 1—Create the factory interface:  public interface DAOFactory {      public AirlineDAO createAirlineDAO  ;     public HotelDAO createHotelDAO  ; }  Step 2—Provide a data source implementation of the factory interface:  public class RdbDAOFactory implements DAOFactory {     private Connection con;      public RdbDAOFactory       String url  {          make connection       conn = …;           }      public AirlineDAO createAirlineDAO   {         return new AirlineDAO conn ;     }     public HotelDAO createHotelDAO   {         return new HotelDAO conn ;     } }  Using an interface to define each “create” method enables a new data  source to provide its own implementation without modifying existing  code. For example, if you wanted to create another factory implemen- tation for an object-oriented database, you would write yet another  class that implements the DAOFactory and defines all its methods in a  custom fashion.   432 Chapter 11  cid:2  Web Tier Design Patterns  Step 3—Create the DAO objects:  public interface AirlineDAO {     public void insert String query ;     public void delete String query ;     public void update String query ; }  class AirlineDAOImpl_RDB implements AirlineDAO {     …     public AirlineDAOImpl_RDB String source  {           make connection     }      public void insert String sql  {     …     }     public void delete String sql  {     …     }     public void update String sql  {     …     }     … }  Each data access object must be implemented for this type of data source.   Step 4—Create the class that provides access to the desired factory:  public class EISFactory {      public static DAOFactory             getRdbDAOFactory String driver  {          return new RdbDAOFactory driver ;   }   public static DAOFactory             getOdbDAOFactory String driver  {   Data Access Object Pattern 433      return new OdbDAOFactory driver ;   } }  A factory class must be provided to enable the client to obtain a handle  to the desired data source. Usually the factory class will pool instances;  for our example, it will simply return a new instance to the caller.  In the end, the client will make the following calls to gain access to the   data access objects for a specific relational database:  public class Client {   public static void main String[] args  {     DAOFactory dao =         EISFactory.getRdbDAOFactory “com.sybex.driver” ;     AirlineDAO airline = dao.createAirlineDAO  ;     airline.insert … ;     …   } } What you gain from this approach is the ability to add a new data source  type to the EISFactory class, which produces an independent implementa- tion of each data access object. Previous code that relies on existing  resources will not require change. If code must be moved to the new  system, one change in the business object is required to call the correct  getXXXFactory …  method. All other code is unaffected if the database  query code is acquired from an external source  such as a file . Ultimately,  the client is left untouched.  The other reason for using this design is to manage pooled connections to  a particular resource. While we didn’t show that technique, it is a common  reason for using any kind of factory.  This approach takes a little more work up front, but limits the amount of   work required when a new data source is introduced into an application.  What you gain is an application that is easy to manage and extensible—it can  grow without affecting previously written code.  Advantages and Disadvantages  As with all advances or approaches, there are advantages and disadvantages.  Depending on the size of the application and potential for change, this pat- tern can offer benefits or cause unnecessary work.   434 Chapter 11  cid:2  Web Tier Design Patterns  Advantages  In general, there are many benefits to the Data Access Object design pattern.  They include:  Hides data access implementation code When the business object  invokes a DAO method, the actual implementation is hidden and trans- parent to the client.  Eliminates code dependencies Separating the DAO object from the  business object makes migrating to a new data source seamless. When  using factories, a change in data source affects only the Data Access  Object layer, leaving the client ignorant to the modification.  Improves code readability and development productivity This happens  for two reasons. The first is a result of separating the business object logic  from the data access logic. Complex data manipulation code is maintained  within its own DAO object. This form of organization can vastly improve  the productivity to generate and maintain a complex application. The sec- ond reason the code is more readable and faster to develop is because this  pattern centralizes all data access into a separate layer. Isolating sections of  code from others can vastly improve code maintenance.  Disadvantages  As with all technologies, the Data Access Object pattern can be used incor- rectly or create additional overhead. Disadvantages include the following:  Provides more classes to manage By separating access code into differ- ent classes, you have more classes to handle.  Causes excessive code maintenance Sometimes developers get overzeal- ous about using patterns and utilize them when they aren’t needed. For  example, if it is highly unlikely for the application to change data source  types, the factory approach might be overkill.  Business Delegate Pattern  Now that you have an understanding of how and why to use data   access objects to help communicate with the information storage system, we  will cover a design pattern that helps the presentation components commu- nicate with business services.   Business Delegate Pattern 435  The Business Delegate pattern is used to prevent the exposure of all   business services to the client. A business service is a specific behavior or  method s  performed by a servlet, JSP, or EJB. There are several reasons why  client code should not access server-side services directly:   cid:2  It makes the client vulnerable to change. As the business evolves, there  is a good chance the business service API will change as well; with the  client communicating directly with services, the client code will also  need to be changed.   cid:2  There is an impact on network performance. To look up and access data,   the client might need to make more method calls than truly necessary.   cid:2  The client must deal with network issues associated with EJB technol- ogy. For the servlet to communicate with an EJB, it must deal with the  lookup and access details of the EJB architecture.  By placing a layer between the client and server, changes made to one side  do not affect the other. This layer is called the Business Delegate layer. The del- egate hides the details of the underlying system. For example, it can handle:   cid:2  The naming and lookup services for EJBs   cid:2  Business service exceptions such as EJBException   cid:2  Server result caching  The naming and lookup services should be transparent to the client. This  is a task that can be handled by the delegate. Generally it takes two steps to  access a single EJB object handle. The first step is a lookup technique that  provides access to the bean’s Home object. The second step is to use the Home  object to either find or create the desired bean. When a delegate is used, the  client is shielded from this process.  Another task handled by the delegate is the interception of server-side  exceptions. When an EJB exception is thrown because some error occurred  with a bean, the client should not be responsible for considering EJB archi- tectural issues to develop an alternative plan. Instead, the delegate can  capture these exceptions and, in turn, generate an application-level excep- tion to send to the client. This keeps the client focused on client-related  issues and problems.  The final task a delegate can handle is caching client results. Instead of  requiring the client to cache all potentially needed information, making  the servlet or JSP object very large when transferred over the network, the    436 Chapter 11  cid:2  Web Tier Design Patterns  delegate can store the information and provide it to the client upon request.  This greatly improves performance and limits the number of network calls.  Figure 11.7 shows how the delegate fits into the application design.  F I G U R E 1 1 . 7 The Business Delegate pattern  Client  Business delegate  Business services  Data source  This figure shows the client communicating to the delegate, which then  communicates with the business services. Some common business services  are enterprise beans or Java Messaging Service  JMS  components. Two  strategies can be applied to this pattern. The first is the Delegate Proxy and  the second is the Delegate Adapter. Both are discussed next.  Delegate Proxy  Delegate Adapter  The Delegate Proxy strategy places a layer between the client and server,  exposing all business methods to the client. The proxy handles the underly- ing tasks needed to invoke each business method without the client needing  to worry about lookup, location, or exception information. From the client’s  perspective, it simply calls the business methods and they “magically” work.  The Delegate Adapter strategy is used when two systems do not use the same  integration language. Let’s say the client is written in XML and the server  components are EJBs; an adapter would be required to join the two distinct  systems. The XML client would invoke the adapter, which would parse the  XML request to then create a delegate and invoke its methods. The delegate  would perform its normal communication with the business service  or bean   and ultimately return results back to the adapter. The adapter could then  prepare the appropriate XML and return it to the client.  Advantages and Disadvantages  Adding yet another layer to an application can provide benefits if used under  the right circumstances. It can also add unnecessary complexity if the design  does not require a translation layer.   Model View Controller Pattern 437  Advantages  On the whole, this pattern requires more work up front, but provides several  long-term benefits. They include:  Improves code manageability Code is more manageable because client  components are not directly linked to server-side components.  Provides easier exception handling Because the delegate can trans- late business service exceptions, the client needs to deal only with  application-level issues. The delegate can capture network-related excep- tions and send more client-oriented exceptions. This simplifies client code  management, because the client does not need to decipher details that are  not related to the Presentation tier.  Offers a simpler business service API While a server application might  have many session beans available, the delegate provides a clean list of  available methods to the client without worrying about which session to  invoke to access a particular behavior. All session management and trans- actions are handled either at the delegate level or on the Server tier—away  from the client.  Improves performance Because the delegate can cache services, the  Presentation tier does not need to make as many network calls to access  commonly requested data.  Disadvantages  There are a few minor disadvantages to this pattern. They include:   Adds complexity By adding an extra layer, you increase the intricacy of  the application.  Decreases flexibility The client is restricted to the options provided by  the delegate.  Model View Controller Pattern  Until now, we have discussed the Value Object and Database   Access Object patterns, which separate server-side tasks into individual  components. We also covered the Business Delegate, which is used to    438 Chapter 11  cid:2  Web Tier Design Patterns  separate the clients from the business services. The Model View Controller   MVC  pattern affects the Presentation layer to improve the application’s  extensibility, flexibility, and manageability. MVC divides the display logic  from the code that causes change.  A project’s success is often measured by its immediate return value, and its  future ability to expand, change, be maintained, and adapt. Most applica- tions should be written with extensibility in mind; this means changes or  additions do not break existing components. The Model View Controller  design pattern is geared toward creating an application that can increase  client-side functionality without warranting changes to the server-side code.  The pattern was originally developed by using the language SmallTalk   and later gained popularity in the Java market through its extensive use  within the Swing component library. The pattern takes a single graphical  object and breaks down its tasks into three pieces:   cid:2  The controller, which triggers a change to the component   cid:2  The model, which manages the data by providing methods to alter or   access the information   cid:2  The view, which provides a visual display of the current data  A scrollbar component is a perfect example of MVC in action. It has a few  controllers, both up and down buttons, plus the slider. When any of these  elements is used, the controller invokes the model. The data associated with  a scrollbar is usually an int value that represents the location of the slider.  The up-arrow controller tells the model to increase the int value, and the  down-arrow controller calls the model’s method to decrease the value. It is  then the model’s responsibility to update the data and notify listeners or  views interested in the recently changed data. Figure 11.8 provides a visual  representation of each MVC component within a scrollbar.  F I G U R E 1 1 . 8 MVC within a scrollbar  View  Controller  Controller  Model  int value = 1;   Model View Controller Pattern 439  The class that handles the visual presentation is notified of a change and is  able to repaint the image to correctly represent the current data. In this case,  the slider would be repositioned to represent the increase or decrease in value. The benefits you gain from creating three classes, rather than two or one,   are as follows:   cid:2  Changes to the controller do not affect any view classes.   cid:2  Changes to the view do not affect any controller classes.   cid:2  You can add additional view or controller classes without affecting   existing code.  By removing the data from the graphical components and by separating   these components into two categories, one that controls and one that dis- plays, you create an application environment that is easily extensible.   The order of operations is as follows:  1. When the controller is triggered, it communicates a change to the   model.  appropriate views.  2. The model makes a change to the data and pushes the new data to the   3. The view receives the new data and displays the new image or form.  In a J2EE environment, JSPs or servlets are often used to communicate  server content graphically to the client. There are two defined model types  used to determine which class is the controller:  Model 1 The Model 1 design places client control in the hands of JSPs.  Basically, the controller is a JSP, usually managed by using custom tags,  and the view is also a JSP.  Model 2 The Model 2 design is currently the favored approach because  it assigns roles based on the purpose of the component. Because servlets  are better suited for handling Java coding logic, they fit nicely into the role  of controller. JSPs, on the other hand, are designed to focus on presenta- tion. Consequently, they represent the view.  In both strategies, the model is not specified, because it can be any number  of components, such as a component on the Web tier side, or EJBs. Given the  design patterns we have presented in this chapter, the business delegate  object is often an ideal candidate for the model role.    440 Chapter 11  cid:2  Web Tier Design Patterns  F I G U R E 1 1 . 9 J2EE MVC  Imagine a basic web application that requires the client to log in prior to  accessing their account information. An MVC implementation of that design  might look similar to the general layout of Figure 11.9.  In Figure 11.9, the login.jsp page is a view that communicates with an  AuthenticationServlet to determine whether the user is valid. The servlet  corresponds with the model  step 1 , which might invoke a session or entity  bean to check the information against the database  step 2 . If the user is  valid, two things can happen: either the model pushes the response to the view   step 3a , ending one cycle, or the model returns the response to the original  controller  step 3b . Most commonly, the model returns the response to  the controller, and the controller then forwards it to the view  step 4 . The  welcome.jsp view is then displayed with the user’s name and necessary  information. If authentication failed, a loginAgain.jsp view would appear.  The process cycles until the user successfully logs in or ends the session.  Browser  login.jsp  Authentication Servlet.java  Controller  4  welcome.jsp  View  1  3b  Web server  Business delegate  Application  server  Business services  2  Database Data source  Model  3a  You might want the underlying controller to be a servlet so that you can:   cid:2  Control authentication   cid:2  Handle application-specific logging   cid:2  Access a database   cid:2  Process requests   cid:2  Utilize the Java debugger   When a process requires a lot of Java code, embedding it within a JSP   object can make the resulting application difficult to read, making it hard to  develop, debug, and maintain. Often your choice is to either use a servlet or,  if you feel the need to utilize only JSPs  Model 1 , create a custom tags. Either  approach is functionally acceptable.   JSP to Servlet  Model View Controller Pattern 441  Separating controller and view often requires JSPs to communicate with   servlets and servlets to communicate with JSPs. Next, we will cover how  these two entities exchange information.  For a JSP component to communicate with a servlet is a simple task. It  requires the use of a bean, which stores the information that is transferred  from one to the other. Consider the following components:   cid:2  A JSP page: login.jsp    cid:2  A bean: UserInfoBean.java   cid:2  A servlet: AuthenticationServlet.java  Let’s first look at how the JSP page  login.jsp  sets up the data to trans-  fer to the servlet:  <jsp:useBean id=”userInfo” scope=”request”       class=”com.syb.jsp.beans.userinfo.UserInfoBean”>              When this section of code is read by the interpreter, a bean instance   called userInfo is either retrieved or created. As you might remember from  Chapter 9, “Java Server Pages  JSPs ,” the jsp:setProperty action uses  reflection to link and change all bean attributes to match the values gener- ated from the request. After the JSP creates the bean with all the necessary  information, it forwards it to the servlet.  It is now up to the AuthenticationServlet to use this bean and extract its  information obtained from the request. Consider the following pseudo-code:  public class AuthenticationSerlvet extends HttpServlet { …     public void doGet HttpServletRequest request,                          HttpServletResponse response        throws ServletException, IOException {        UserInfoBean userInfo =          UserInfoBean request.getAttribute “userInfo” ;   442 Chapter 11  cid:2  Web Tier Design Patterns           Access the bean’s get methods to extract its data       String name = userInfo.getLoginName  ;       String pwd = userInfo.getPassword  ;           Use the model handle   made available from another          method  to access and authenticate the bean.                  boolean status = model.validateUser loginName, pwd ;             if  status == true  {           forward to the next JSP page in the application       } else {           forward to a “login failed, try again” JSP.       }     } }  After the information from the bean is extracted, the servlet acts like a   controller and requests that the model perform a validation. The model then  determines whether the user is valid. Depending on the design, the model can  either return a boolean to the AuthenticationServlet to determine where  to forward the request response, or the model itself can handle this task. In  our example, the model passes forwarding responsibility back to the servlet.  Now let’s look at how the servlet communicates with JSPs.   In order for a controller to push data forward to a view, the servlet must  communicate with a JSP. As covered in Chapter 2, “The Servlet Model,” the  RequestDispatcher can be used to forward the response generation to  another servlet or JSP. To demonstrate this concept, we will build on the  AuthenticationServlet. In this interpretation, we explicitly show you  how the servlet accesses the model or delegate called Delegate.java.  import java.io.*; import javax.servlet.*; import javax.servlet.http.*;  public class AuthenticateServlet extends HttpServlet {          public void init   throws ServletException{  Servlet to JSP   Model View Controller Pattern 443          Delegate model = new Delegate  ;         ServletContext context=           getServletConfig  .getServletContext  ;         context.setAttribute “delegate”, model ;     }      public void doGet HttpServletRequest req,                       HttpServletResponse res         throws ServletException, IOException {                  UserInfoBean userInfo =           UserInfoBean req.getAttribute “userInfo” ;          String name = userInfo.getLoginName  ;         String pwd = userInfo.getPassword  ;                  ServletContext context=           getServletConfig  .getServletContext  ;         Delegate model=           Delegate context.getAttribute “delegate” ;         boolean status = model.validateUser name, pwd ;                              if status==true  {           RequestDispatcher disp=             req.getRequestDispatcher “ app Welcome.jsp” ;           disp.forward req, res ;         } else {           RequestDispatcher disp=            req.getRequestDispatcher “ app loginAgain.jsp” ;           disp.forward req, res ;          }     } } The AuthenticateServlet.java  controller  file creates a Delegate   object when the class is first initialized by the web container. When a login  request is made, the controller accesses the delegate and asks it to validate  the user. Depending on the response, the request is forwarded to the appro- priate JSP  or view .   444 Chapter 11  cid:2  Web Tier Design Patterns  Advantages and Disadvantages  MVC is one of the most popular design patterns and is being utilized when- ever possible. From a managerial perspective, the benefits are great and the  problems minor, if any.  Advantages  Like the Business Delegate pattern, MVC requires more work up front, but  provides several long-term benefits. They include:  Provides job separation Web designers can focus on creating graphic  presentations through JSPs, while code developers can generate code to  perform tasks using servlets.  Improves code manageability Because each task is contained within its  own object, it is easy to locate and determine where a problem exists. This  decreases the time needed to fix errors or expand the code.   Disadvantages  Any pattern that is not used correctly can actually cause the problems you  are attempting to correct. Here is one disadvantage to this pattern:  Adds complexity Once again, the addition of objects means there are  more classes to handle. However, if the application is carefully designed,  this problem is negligible.  The pattern does require more work and careful planning, but that is   usually the sign of a good application.  Justifying the Need for a Robust System  Skeptical investors for a new startup company, ePayroll Inc., recently  requested that the company provide an application design that models the  web application they wish to develop. The application is intended to enable  businesses to enter their payroll over the Internet. The developers justified  the need to develop the following components:  EJBs Given the need for strict security, data integrity, and use of external  resources, enterprise beans offer a way to manage these issues through the   application server without requiring developers to write code to handle  these issues   Summary  Summary 445  Value objects To reduce the number of network calls, value objects  should be used to contain groups of related data.  Data access objects As the business expands and technology improves,  there is a strong chance that there will be a need to upgrade the back-end  data storage system. These objects will ensure a smooth transition.  A delegate Because their groups of developers are specialized in specific  areas, the Delegate model enables one person to manage the link between  web and server components.  Views Web application designers can focus on developing an aestheti- cally pleasing interface, without having to be trained in Java programming.  Controllers Their strong team of Java programmers can help develop  front-end components.  In this chapter, we covered the four main design patterns:  The Value Object pattern is a data object used to reduce code dupli- cation and traffic. By creating an object containing all the necessary  data, a single call for the object can be made rather than multiple calls  for the same data.  Benefits:   cid:2  Reduces network traffic   cid:2  Reduces code duplication   cid:2  Enables concurrent access and transactions  The Data Access Object pattern is used to decouple a business object’s  code and that used to access a storage system. By separating the  two, it is easier to maintain the code if storage system changes are  required.  Benefits:   cid:2  Hides data access implementation code   446 Chapter 11  cid:2  Web Tier Design Patterns   cid:2  Eliminates code dependencies   cid:2  Improves code readability and development productivity  The Business Delegate pattern places a layer between the Web and  Server tiers to limit the number of dependencies between the two.  Benefits:   cid:2  Improves code manageability   cid:2  Provides easier exception handling   cid:2  Offers a more simple business service API   cid:2  Improves performance  The MVC pattern separates web components used to control the  application versus those components designed to display information.  The application is more flexible and expandable as a result.  Benefits:   cid:2  Provides job separation   cid:2  Improves code manageablity  Given a list of architectural issues, be able to select the appropriate design  pattern to solve the problems. The Value Object and Data Access Object  design patterns help modularize server-side code to improve manageability  and expandability—whereas the Model View Controller pattern is used to  produce the same result for client-side code. Architecturally, the Business  Delegate places a layer between the Web and Server tiers to eliminate any  dependencies.   Be able to identify the benefits associated with any one of the following  design patterns: Value Object, MVC, Data Access Object, or Business  Delegate. Knowing the benefits associated with each pattern will help  you determine which pattern is appropriate for a given scenario.

Which of the following patterns uses accessor and mutator methods to   reduce the number of network calls needed to alter or access data?   452 Chapter 11  cid:2  Web Tier Design Patterns  Answers to Review Questions  1. C.  A value object contains data that can be transferred in one call.  2. B.  Using Data Access objects enables J2EE applications to swap out the  EIS tier without requiring much change to code. If done correctly,  the only change is made to the Data Access objects themselves.  3. A, B, D.  All three patterns isolate tasks. The Business Delegate   isolates the Web tier from the Server tier; Data Access Object isolates  database communication from business objects; MVC isolates the  controller code from presentation code.  4. C.  When using the Entity Inherits Value Object strategy, there is no   need to define the value data in the value object and entity bean.  5. D.  MVC separates the controller code, which is developed by using  servlets, from the presentation code, which is developed by using JSPs.  The skill set used to create the two is different. A web designer can  create JSPs with ease, whereas programmers are better suited to focus  on functionality, such as that handled by a servlet.  6. A.  The Business Delegate places a layer between the client and the  business services. This prevents the client from dealing with access and  lookup issues to utilize the server.   7. C.  The factory strategy simply requires access classes to be added to   the current list of DAO objects. Existing code is left untouched.  8. A.  Including a Business Delegate enables exceptions to be intercepted   before reaching web components. The delegate can then send a  user-friendly application an exception to help web developers better  understand the problem.  9. A, B, C, D.  All four patterns separate tasks into individual classes.  This is the key to code manageability. Problems can be located easily,  and changes have minimal, if any, effect on other classes.  10. C.  One strategy of the Value Object class is to provide public   members, thus removing the need to have get or set methods.  11. B.  Third-party or Java’s reflection tools can be used to introspect a   database or data source to generate code for data access objects.   Answers to Review Questions 453  12. D.  Although this situation isn’t ideal, the web designers can be thor- oughly utilized to generate appealing view components. The developers,  on the other hand, can deal with controller and back-end components.  13. A.  The Adapter Delegate strategy can be used to translate between  two systems. One system can write to the delegate, which can interpret  the request and then communicate it to the appropriate source.  14. B.  Data access objects hide all SQL implementation. Instead of   including database-specific code within a business object, it is placed  within a DAO.  15. C.  The Value Object can contain “get” and “set” methods to access  or change its member variables. These methods are used locally rather  than over the network.

Answers to Practice Exam  Answers to Practice Exam 469  1. E.  A HEAD method request will return only the header informa-  tion from the response. GET and POST usually return the requested  information in the body of the response. PUT can return a body  to indicate whether the request was successful. STORE is an invalid  request type.  2. D.  An HTTP response contains a defined protocol, status code, and  description, plus header data and an optional body. An HTTP request  contains the method type, header information, parameters, and body,  but not the status code or protocol. HTTP protocol is not a valid  object. None of the options contains all the listed elements.   3. C.  The Accept tag is found in a request. An HTTP request begins   with a request line, which defines the action that is being desired by the  server. It can then contain a header and body.   4. B.  The method getRealPath String path  is found in both the   ServletRequest interface and the ServletContext interface. It has,  however, been deprecated in the ServletRequest interface, as of  version 2.1 of the Java servlet API.  5. D.  The convenience method for initializing a servlet takes in no argu- ments. It ensures that the init ServletConfig config  method will  be called, but it saves the developer the burden of making a call to  super.init config . The third option fails because an overriding  method cannot throw an exception that the parent class method does  not throw. A subclass would work, but not a superclass.  6. B.  New to the 2.3 specification is the addition of the doHead …    method. Its default implementation method is now called instead of  the doGet …  method.   7. B.  The getHeaders   method parses through each value and returns   the result as an array.  8. B.  The code compiles because syntactically nothing is wrong. It does  not run, however. A forward …  cannot be called if a response has  been committed. Calling close   commits the response.   470 Answers to Practice Exam  9. D.  There is no tag used to identify only the root welcome page for an  application. Consequently, none of options provided are suitable. Some  people might assume that the welcome-file tag is the correct answer,  but it is not, because it identifies files for the root and its subdirectories.  10. C.  The session-timeout tag identifies the maximum number of   minutes an inactive HttpSession can exist before the container can  consider removing it from memory.  11. A.  For every web application, there must be a unique context path   defined.  12. B.  The command that can be used to compress files and create a   proper WAR file is jar. The c option compresses the defined directory  and any subdirectories, whereas a t option displays only its contents.  13. D.  Logging messages is a feature of the a ServletContext object,  not an HttpSession object. Both enable you to get, set, and remove  attributes.  14. E.  The HttpSessionActivationListener is called when a session  is about to be passivated to move it to another server, and when a ses- sion is about to be activated to bring it back to life on the new server.   15. C.  The   tag is an identifier that tells the server   that the application should be run from multiple systems if the server  supports that functionality.  16. A, B, C, D.  When a context is initialized or destroyed, the   ServletContextListener is notified. When sessions are  initialized or destroyed, the HttpSessionListener is notified.  Finally, the HttpSessionAttributeListener and the  ServletContextAttributeListener are notified when changes  to their attributes occur.  17. D.  When setStatus …  is called, the response is the responsibility  of the developer. If the value is set to an error code, the server will look  to find an associated error page. If one is not found, the server will halt  the program and display a message indicating an error page could not  be found.  18. A, B.  The destroy   method does not throw any exceptions in it sig- nature, ands the init …  method throws only the ServletException.   Answers to Practice Exam 471  19. B, D.  An UnavailabeException can be created in two ways. The  first is with a message to identify that the servlet is permanently  unavailable. The second is with a message and an integer defining the  estimated time the servlet is temporarily unavailable. No default con- structor exists.  20. C.  The HttpServletRequest object provides the servlet access to  the current client session. The client will use the same session object  for multiple requests until the session is terminated.  21. B.  The only legal interface name provided is HttpSession. Within  that interface, the “set get” attribute methods provide a way to add  data to the client session object.  22. B, C.  Whole values must be used to define the session-timeout tag  as specified by the servlet specification. Negative values can be used to  indicate that sessions will not be terminated.  23. D.  The valueBound …  method is called when an object is bound to  a session object. The HttpSessionBindingEvent is passed and con- tains the session, name, and value object.  24. A.  The INPUT TYPE tag defines the type of component being used. It  can be a text field represented as text or a hidden data element rep- resented by a hidden value.  25. A.  During the identification phase, a user presents themselves as a   principal by identifying themselves using a user ID or login name.  26. B.  The order for security tags is critical. You must first define the  security-constraint, which protects the servlet, and its method.  The login-config is next. This tag defines the type of authorization  and realm. Finally, the security-role is used to explain which roles  can access the protected code.  27. A.  The entries within the web.xml form are case sensitive. Conse-  quently, “Basic” is not recognized as a valid authentication type.  28. A.  The doFilter …  method takes three agreement: ServletRequest,   ServletResponse, and FilterChain.  29. C.  Class variables are shared among all instances of a servlet and are   defined under the class name by using the keyword static.   472 Answers to Practice Exam  30. A.  Request attributes are applied to a request object using the   setAttribute …  method. The first argument is the key name used  to identify the object defined as the second argument.  31. D.  The interface name is SingleThreadModel. When implemented,  the container manages the life cycle of that servlet differently. Either the  container will synchronize the service method or a pool of instances will  be provided.  32. B.  The SingleThreadModel does not prevent synchronization prob- lems when threads access shared resources such as static class variables.  Instance variables are safe if the container pools instances. Both session  and request attributes are also safe by design.  33. A, B.  When a JSP page is translated to servlet source code, the class  generated can implement either the javax.servlet.jsp.JspPage or  javax.servlet.jsp.HttpJspPage interface.   34. D.  By nature, static blocks are read when a class is loaded into   memory. Because scriptlets are embedded within the service method,  including a static block within a method breaches Java coding rules.  35. B.  The DOCTYPE tag defines the root element of the deployment   descriptor. In this example, the root is specified as web-app3. Conse- quently, the DTD must encompass all resources and configuration  settings within the tags   and  .  36. D.  Four packages are automatically imported into a JSP page. The  include java.lang.*, javax.servlet.*, javax.servlet.jsp.*,  and javax.servlet.http.*.  37. C.  The first option fails because name is not an attribute of the  jsp:useBean element. A better choice would be id. The second  option fails because the jsp:forward tag is closed with a  > when it  should close with a   tag because a parameter is being  defined. The third option is correct because it follows the attribute  rules of the jsp:include element.  38. B.  The first and last options fail because package and context are not   valid scope values. The third option fails because the setProperty  name and useBean ID must match, even with casing. Finally, the second  option is correct because the bean name can represent a class or a  serialized resource in which the value would be resolved as a b c.ser.   Answers to Practice Exam 473  39. D.  All implicit objects are bound to the pageContext because it han- dles their namespaces. The pageContext object provides a handle to  all other objects. Through the methods getOut  , getException  ,  getPage  , getRequest  , getResponse  , getSession  ,  getServletConfig  , and getServletContext  , you can obtain  access to each object.   40. D.  The ServletContext, known as the application object, is used  to provide information general to the entire web application. The JSP  engine running the code is available via the getServerInfo   method  of this class.  41. B.  After a taglib directive is defined within a JSP page, all custom   tags within that library are available to the page. The tags can be  accessed by using the select prefix, and each custom tag implements  the Tag interface. The second option is incorrect because the library  file can be located in any directory specified by the taglib-location  directive in the web.xml file.  42. C.  The JSP page uses the web.xml file to locate the tag library it looks  to load. The taglib-uri element maps directly to the <%@ taglib  uri… %> directive defined within the page.   43. D.  A NESTED scope indicates that the variable is available between  the start and end tags. This is different from an AT_BEGIN scope,  which states that the variable is accessible from the beginning tag until  the action is no longer in scope.  44. A, D.  An empty tag has no body. You can create either a single open- ing tag that terminates with a forward slash, or an opening and closing  tag with nothing in between.   45. D.  By default, the doAfterBody …  method returns the constant   SKIP_BODY.  46. A.  When the custom action is invoked, a prefix is used to generalize  which library is being used, and the suffix is the value assigned to the  element name.  47. C.  Directives are denoted with an at  @  sign. An exclamation point   marks a declaration, whereas an equal sign is used for expressions.  Finally, a percent sign alone is for scriptlets.   474 Answers to Practice Exam  48. A.  By separating development of the controller  the servlet  and the   view  the JSP , you can use MVC to enable individuals who are skilled  in a particular area to focus on developing within their skill set.  49. C.  By separating the data-source implementation into unique data  access objects, you can easily swap out DAO objects when the data  source is changed, without affecting other code.  50. B.  The Value Object design pattern can create objects by using the con- structor and provide only accessor methods. Without mutator methods,  the user must reconstruct the object when changes have to be made.

The request object initiates the _jspService …  method upon a  client’s call. When created, the request object generates header information,  such as cookies, the intent or type of request, such as a GET or POST, and pos- sible parameters passed by the client.   request scope Indicates that an object is accessible from all pages pro- cessing the same request.  RequestDispatcher A wrapper class that can be used to forward a request  to an error page.  response An object containing the information requested by the client.  response object An instance of the implementation-specific subclass  of the javax.servlet.ServletResponse interface, often known as  HttpServletResponse. Unlike servlets, it enables HTTP status codes and  headers in the JSP to be changed after output has been sent to the client.  role-based Describes a system in which users are assigned to roles, such as  Manager, Employee, or Guest. Each role is assigned certain privileges, and  access is granted to roles rather than users.   488 Glossary  S  scope The life span of a data element.  scriptlet A code fragment used within a JSP page.  sendError …  A method that gives the developer an opportunity to set an  error status code for the response header and enables the servlet to replace  the response body with a server-specific page explaining the error.  servlet A platform-independent web component. Servlets are loaded  dynamically into a web server, from where they can process business logic  and generate a layout for the client on an as-needed basis.  servlet life cycle The various stages a servlet encounters during different  points of an application’s life. The cycle consists of a servlet being loaded and  instantiated. It then waits for requests for service. When the server deems  it appropriate, the servlet can be taken out of service.  Servlet model A model that provides small reusable server programs  the ability to process a variety of requests from a client and then return a  response efficiently.  servlet path The mapped directory name associated with the actual servlet.  Usually this consists of either the mapped servlet name or a mapped path to  the servlet, but nothing more.

Glossary 489  session object An implicit object created when a client makes its first  request to an application. It is unique to a client and can exist longer than a  single request or even longer than the life of a client. It is an object used to  track client-specific data for the duration of the conversation or a specified  period of time.  session scope Indicates that objects are available for the life of the session.  Until the session is closed manually or automatically due to a method call  or a timeout, components can exist and share data.  setProperty action An action used to set the parameter values of the  bean in use.  SingleThreadModel An interface used as a flag to notify the container  how to handle the servlet life cycle. As per the API specifications, a servlet  that implements the SingleThreadModel is “guaranteed” to allow only one  thread access to the service   method at a time.
