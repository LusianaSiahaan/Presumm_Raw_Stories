[ 5 ]    Introduction to a Responsive  Web Application  In this chapter, we be introduced to responsive web design followed by an  understanding of technology stack that made responsive web application  development possible.  The current trend of technology revolution has led us to a point where we can  see many wireless devices with different screen size, resolution, and processing  capabilities. It is really challenging and difficult to create different versions of   web applications for each and every device type. To address this challenge,   it needs a design solution that can address these problems. Responsive web design  provides the platform and flexibility where we can write code once and publish the  application everywhere.  Designing a website to look good at one particular resolution was the standard and  that standard was adequate for almost all purposes. Now, more and more people  are viewing web content on smartphones and tablets. The most successful websites  must have content designed to fit on any size screen or any type of device. Designing  content in this manner is also known as responsive web design. We need to give  all users, regardless of their access platform, a seamless experience, and responsive  web design offers a cost-efficient way of achieving that. Responsive web content can  dynamically change size, fonts, and colors to match whatever device your customers  might be using.   Introduction to a Responsive Web Application  The most important dimensions of a responsive design are as follows:     An adaptive grid-based layout that must be responsive enough to the    client-side environment. There are two different approaches for an adaptive  layout: the first one is a fixed layout and the other one is a fluid layout.   Fluid layouts are always proportional to the screen size.     Fluid images must maintain the aspect ratio. To maintain the aspect ratio,   we can go for two approaches, either setting the max-height to 100 percent   or max-width of 100 percent. This makes the images overflow in either  direction. The other way of handling the images is to clip a portion of   the image, though it is not recommended.     The new CSS3 media queries make the browser more intelligent.   Now, browsers can make the decision to load the appropriate CSS   at runtime. This makes them adaptable to the client environment.  Responsive design is made possible through the use of three core  ingredients: a flexible grid-based layout, flexible images and media,  and CSS media queries.  Benefits of a responsive design  The most important benefits of responsive web application are as follows:     Pleasant user experience in each type of device    Reduced development cost compared to developing different applications   for each device type     Reduced cost on advertising and marketing compared to maintaining   campaigns for every application for each device     Better indexing in search engines and improved search engine    optimization  SEO  Increased conversion rates and lead generation as SEO is increased    visibility of a web application in search engines       Responsive web design uses a single code base, but in reality, different devices have  to be accounted for. While a desktop version can display a lot of content at once,  for smaller screens, you need to know exactly what content truly matters. To create  a great experience for all users, you need to consider that people will use different  devices in different circumstances and with different goals. With a responsive web  design, more effort and time will be involved to get the right user experience for  your target audience.  [ 8 ]   Chapter 1  If you look into different applications present online such as blogs and sports  applications, then you will notice that the end user behaviors are similar and follow  a common pattern. To provide the same experience for the end users, the layout and  other elements in the application must be designed for customization. This needs  more effort and time in developing the layout and the code.  Server- versus client-side detection  Addressing the issue of developing applications for different media types and  devices can be solved in two ways. The first one is the server-side detection where  middleware is responsible for reading the request header sent by the browser and  redirects the request to the appropriate version of the application. This requires you  to develop a different version of the application. It means an e-commerce site must  have a separate code base for each type of device.  The second one is the client-side detection. It should be done by the browser and  apply relative CSS based on the device or screen type. With this idea, the responsive  design is born. The real benefit is that one has to maintain a single code base for this.  The technology stack  The following diagram shows the building blocks for responsive web application  development. Each block in the diagram represents a technology that enables  responsive web application development.  web  application  Media queries  [ 9 ]   Introduction to a Responsive Web Application  HTML5 HTML5 is the latest version of HTML, released by the W3C foundation with more  modern features included such as more semantics and usability features. This helps  in responsive web application development with more ease and less effort. Some of  the key points that highlight why HTML5 is a better candidate than other versions of  HTML are as follows:      Inclusion of new HTML5 elements such as video and audio as native reduces  the use of an additional third-party plugin     Enhanced existing elements such as form element reduce the need for an       additional amount of code to be written Inclusion of Canvas and SVG for graphic rendering and drawing adds  additional capabilities  CSS3 and media queries Features such as media type detection and layout manipulation of media queries are  useful to build a responsive layout. Some of the key points of CSS3 are as follows:     CSS3 animations and transitions reduce the need for JavaScript processing,   favoring, instead, a native implementation that can vastly improve  performance on mobile devices where processing power can be quite   limited, while falling back gracefully to immediate changes in browsers   that do not support them.     Support of new measuring units such as rem helps in building a logical   relationship among elements' dimensions present inside a page.     Ultimately, the vw and vh units will greatly enhance the ability of a   developer to size elements relative to the viewport.     FlexBox provides numerous benefits with direction-based alignment and  element ordering inside a layout. For a responsive design, this means that  a default ideal order can be established via the document order to provide  greater SEO benefits, while different ordering can be provided based on  viewport size, device orientation type, and so on, to display content in the  best format for a given use case.  [ 10 ]   Chapter 1  JavaScript JavaScript brings the capability of feature detection for the browser. It helps in  choosing the right component for the end user and makes the browser responsive   to its environment.  Some of the key points about JavaScript are as follows:     Browser feature detection helps you to find features that are supported   by the browser. This helps in helps you to execute the appropriate code   in the application.     Rendering behavior of the site can be altered using JavaScript.  Measuring responsiveness  There are many parameters for measuring the responsiveness of an application.  Layout, content, and navigation are the three most important parameters for a  responsive web application development. The following diagram shows the three  different building blocks of a responsive web application:   Element positions   Appearance   Page ﬂow     Layout: While developing a responsive web application for all kinds    of devices, the layout should be developed based on the available size.   Based on the breakpoints for each device size, the layout gets altered.   This includes show and hide of a section in the layout.     Content: For small screens, the available viewing space is very small.   While developing a responsive web application, the text content must   be responsive. It includes the typography, images, and other media   elements present inside the page.     Navigation: For touch-enabled devices, the navigational elements will   be different to those on medium devices. How these navigational items   are to be presented to the end user is really a design challenge. It should   be rendered seamless to the end user while navigating in any devices.  [ 11 ]   Introduction to a Responsive Web Application  Devices and screens  If you look at the gadget market for handheld devices, you can find a wide range of  devices with different screen sizes. If you ask me what the optimal size for a device  screen is, I probably could not answer you without knowing the purpose. Each and  every device is good for a specific use. So, the optimal size of a screen is directly  dependent on the end user.  A wide screen with good graphics and pixel density may be the best fit for a gaming  end user. For a regular end user, a small device is a good fit. The web application  design must support all these screen sizes. The usability and the user experience  must be equivalent to all types of screens. Also, it is much more important when it  comes to an e-commerce site. If the end user is browsing the site on a mobile device  and the e-commerce device is only designed for a desktop, then it does not generate  the same pleasant experience that will lose the leads.  The soul of an e-commerce site is lead generation and it is only possible when the  application will provide seamless access to the end user irrespective of the browsing  device. This clearly requires the application to be responsive to its environment or  adapt itself based on the screen or device.  Media types  All these devices  desktops, tablets, mobiles, and laptops  fall in one of the   following media types. The following figure shows all the media types listed   in the W3C specification:  [ 12 ]   Chapter 1  TV  TTY  Media  type     Braille: This is used for braille tactile feedback devices.    Embossed: This is used for paged braille printers.    Handheld: This is used for handheld devices. Smartphones and tablets do      Print: This is used for paged material and for documents viewed on screen in   not fall to this.  the print preview mode.     Projection: This is used for projected presentations, for example, projectors.    Screen: This is used primarily for color computer screens and smartphones.    Speech: This is used for speech synthesizers.    TTY: This is used for media using a fixed-pitch character grid. It includes  teletypes, terminals, or portable devices with limited display capabilities.     TV: This is used for television type devices. It includes low resolution, color,   limited-scrollability screens, and audio.     Grid: This is used for visual and tactile media types.  Available expressions for media queries to filter the CSS rules are as follows:     width: This is the width of the current window    height: This is the height of the current window    device-width: This is the width of the device  [ 13 ]   Introduction to a Responsive Web Application     device-height: This is the height of the device    orientation: This should be either landscape or portrait    aspect-ratio: This is the aspect ratio of the current window    device-aspect-ratio: This is the aspect ratio of the device    color: This is the number of color bits per color component    color-index: This is the number of available colors on the device    monochrome: This is the number of bits per pixel in a monochrome    frame buffer     resolution: This is the resolution of the device    scan: This should be either progressive or interlace  Media queries  Media queries are one of the best features of CSS3. Using this feature, we can decide  which style sheet should be applied on the web page at runtime.  Media queries can be used as external or internal style sheets. An external style sheet  is easier to organize; it is not downloaded by browsers that don't support it, but it  uses an extra HTTP request. An internal style sheet, on the other hand, does not  require an extra HTTP request, but the whole style sheet is downloaded for browsers  even if they do not support media queries, and it can be harder to organize.  The following code is an example of an external media queries call:  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text CSS" media="screen and  max-device- width: 480px  " href="abc.css"  >  The following code is an example of internal media queries:  body {     background: gray; } @media all and  max-width: 480px { body{     background: blue;     } }  [ 14 ]   Chapter 1  Downloading the example code You can download the example code files for all Packt books you have  purchased from your account at http:  www.packtpub.com.

Role of media queries  CSS3 provides a new set of features called media queries for responsive web  application development. These media queries are helpful for conditional CSS3 used  on a page based on the media type, device width, and other parameters. Generally,  the following parameters help in applying the correct CSS3 to the web page:     Height and width of the device refers to the size of the device    Height and width of the browser refers to the viewable area    Screen resolution refers to the pixel and color depth of the screen    Orientation of the device refers to the portrait or landscape mode  Using media queries, the layout can be designed in the following two ways:     The adaptive layout: This is based on a pretty simple idea: instead of using  percentage, we will give our layout fixed sizes. The layout will adapt those  sizes depending of the width of the browser viewport, thus creating a layout  with different breakpoints.     The responsive layout: This is a mix between fluid and adaptive layouts.  It will use the relative units of the fluid layout and the breakpoints of the  adaptive one.  Responsive frameworks  There are many frameworks available from different vendors for responsive   web application development. Some of the popular libraries are explored in the  following sections.

We are going to use the Bootstrap 3 framework for responsive web application  development. In the following chapters, we will build an e-commerce web  application that will be responsive in design.  [ 18 ]   Chapter 1  The plan is as follows:     Building the layout for the application    Populating the content in the layout          Building a currency converter    Debugging and testing the web application for responsiveness  Integrating the application with social media sites Integrating a payment system with the Add to Cart feature  Summary  In this chapter, we have learned about the need for a responsive web application   and what challenges it brings to a web developer. We have also learned about the  latest responsive libraries available for development. We have understood how   a responsive layout can increase the user experience. In the following chapter,   we will learn to develop a responsive layout using CSS3.  [ 19 ]    Creating a Responsive  Layout for a   Web Application  In this chapter, we will set up our Java-based web project and develop the layout  required to create our responsive web application. The process of developing the  layout follows a step-wise approach. Initially, we will draw a wireframe for the  layout, and then, we will prepare code for each section using Bootstrap 3 classes.  Later on in this chapter, we will verify the layout with different screen sizes   using some tools.  Required software and tools  We need the following software to be installed to develop the responsive   web application:     An Eclipse Java EE IDE of Juno Kepler version for web developers     http:  www.eclipse.org      Apache Tomcat 7    Opera Mobile emulator    The draw.io online tool    The Mozilla Firefox browser    The Google Chrome browser   Creating a Responsive Layout for a Web Application  Setting up a Java-based web project  In this section, we will set up a Java-based web project in Eclipse. To do this, we have  to create a new dynamic web project. The following screenshot shows the window to  create a new web project. In Eclipse, click on the File button and choose New to list  the different project types present in Eclipse.  The different available project types present are shown in the following screenshot.  When this window appears, choose the Dynamic Web Project option.  [ 22 ]   When you have chosen the Dynamic Web Project option, a New Dynamic   Web Project window will open asking for Project name, as shown in the   following screenshot:  Chapter 2     [ 23 ]   Creating a Responsive Layout for a Web Application  For our application, we will name the project MyResponsiveWebApp. The project  structure will look like the following screenshot:  The WebContent folder consists of all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.   The Navigator view of this empty project will look like the following screenshot:  [ 24 ]   Chapter 2  Configuring Bootstrap 3  In this section, we will configure the Bootstrap 3 library in our web project.  Download the Bootstrap 3 library from http:  getbootstrap.com getting- started download. Bootstrap 3 has three different folders in its distribution  package. They are explained as follows:     js: This folder contains all the scripts required for the Bootstrap 3 library    fonts: This folder contains all the font-related files including the Glyph icons    css: This folder contains all the style sheet-related files with Bootstrap's   default theme  The following figure shows the structure of the Bootstrap 3 library:  dist  js  [ 25 ]   Creating a Responsive Layout for a Web Application  The details of each file present inside these folders are given as follows:     The fonts folder contains the glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot,   glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg, glyphicons-halflings-regular. woff, and glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf files containing all icons  used in Bootstrap 3.     The js folder contains the bootstrap.js and bootstrap.min.js script files.   The bootstrap.js file is the uncompressed version, while bootstarp.min. js file is the compressed file.     The css folder contains the bootstrap.css, bootstrap.min.css,   bootstrap.theme.css, and bootstrap.theme.min.css style sheet files.  The bootstrap.css file is the uncompressed version, while the bootstrap. min.css file is compressed file. The bootstrap.theme.css file contains the  default Bootstrap styles in the uncompressed format. The bootstrap.theme. min.css file contains default Bootstrap styles in the compressed format.  To configure Bootstrap 3 in the project, we need to put the css, js, and fonts   folders inside the WebContent folder and add the corresponding files, as shown   in the following screenshot:  [ 26 ]   Chapter 2  Creating a wireframe for a web  application In this section, we will create a wireframe for our web application. An online  tool called draw-io is used to draw the wireframe. You can check out the tool at  https:  www.draw.io . The following screenshot shows the prototype of the  drawing created using the draw.io tool:  [ 27 ]   Creating a Responsive Layout for a Web Application  The page is divided in three rows and explained as follows:     The first row is about the product categories  the menu . For example,    a product store can have books, electronics, and stationary sections.     The second row is about the hero content. The hero section can    have a carousel that can contain different product offers or   important announcements.     The third row is to display all the listed products for any selected category.   Each product can have an image, pricing, and social links. The listed  products are in a grid format. Each row in a grid may contain N number   of products depending on the screen's size.  The interaction of these components is explained as follows:     The first row is the navbar containing all product categories. A click event  will be associated with each product category. The click event will make an  AJAX call for the list of products.     The second row is a hero section. This section will display the product of  the day. For example, it may be a big image or a carousel highlighting an  important announcement or an offer.     The third row will render all the listed products from the previous response   the hero section . The number of products listed in the grid row depends on  the screen size. For example, a bigger screen will have five products and a  smaller screen will have two products.  Responsive layouts  A responsive layout has many benefits, which are as follows:     Scaling based on the screen size: Based on the screen size of the client,    the layout adjusts itself for an optimized experience     Single code file based: A single HTML file is always easy to maintain    than multiple versions of the file     Similar user experience: A similar user experience is maintained in all       Lead generation: This will increase proportionally as per better    types of devices  user experience  [ 28 ]   Chapter 2  Creating a layout for large and small  devices  Based on the wireframe, we have a flat design for large devices. In our application, the  important component is the list of products where products are shown as grids in the  row and column format. Based on the device's screen size, the number of products per  row will change. For example, a device with a large screen can show four products in   a row and a device with a small screen can show three products per row. The layout   of the page is a fluid layout and will change based on the screen's size.  Developing the layout  In this section, we will realize the previously discussed wireframe with real code.  From the preceding section, it is evident that we need to develop three sections,  mentioned as follows:     The menu section    The hero section    The list of products section  Before going into the development of each section, we need to understand   the containers provided by Bootstrap. The following section discusses the   Bootstrap containers.  Bootstrap 3 containers Bootstrap provides fixed- and fluid-width containers. The CSS classes, .container  and .container-fluid, are used to set up the base layout.  An example of the .container class is as follows:           Responsive product Store                  [ 29 ]   Creating a Responsive Layout for a Web Application  The following screenshot shows Chrome's development toolbar's layout that has a  fixed width:  An example of the .container-fluid class is as follows:           Responsive product Store                  [ 30 ]   The following screenshot shows Chrome's development toolbar's layout that has   no width:  Chapter 2  Developing a row In Bootstrap 3, the .row class is used to create a row. There can be many rows   in a single page. All the rows' classes must be enclosed inside a container class,  shown as follows:                Responsive product Store     [ 31 ]   Creating a Responsive Layout for a Web Application                      Row1                     Row2                     Row3                       The following screenshot shows the three different rows created in the browser:  [ 32 ]   Developing the menu section Based on the wireframe, a menu is similar to the navbar. The nav element is used  to create the navbar element in Bootstrap 3. Each menu item is nested in the li tag,  inside an unordered list  ul , shown as follows:  Chapter 2                Responsive product Store               <nav class="navbar navbar-inverse navbar-static-top"  role="navigation">                             <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle collapsed" data- toggle="collapse" data-target="ts-top-menu">                                     Navigation buttons                                                                           PRODUCTS                    <!-- Collect the nav links, forms, and other content for  toggling -->                                     Category 1                                  Category 2                                  Category 3                                                     [ 33 ]   Creating a Responsive Layout for a Web Application                  The navbar will be rendered in the browser, shown as follows:  For a smaller screen size, it will be rendered as shown in the following screenshot.  It has a button to expand the detailed menu list. This view is really helpful for small  screens due to the space constraint in the monitor. The following screenshot is taken  in Chrome in a smaller screen size:  [ 34 ]   Chapter 2  The expanded version for the preceding navbar looks like the following screenshot.  The property to expand and collapse is due to the data-toggle and data-target  attributes, which are explained as follows:     The data-toggle attribute has the value for the property of the effect,    such as collapse     The data-target attribute has the value for the target DOM element that   will expand and collapse on click event  Developing the hero section Based on the wireframe, developing the hero section will be the main focus area.   To the represent the hero section, Bootstrap has a .jumbotron class.  The code of the jumbotron class is shown as follows:                Responsive product Store                  [ 35 ]   Creating a Responsive Layout for a Web Application           Hero Section                        The jumbotron class renders in browser, as shown in the following screenshot:  Developing the list of products section Based on the wireframe, this section will display the list of products.   The ts-product class is the css class to represent each product. To align   products in a row inside a grid, we have used a container class called   .ts-product-container. The display:inline-block style sheet   property is used to put each product in a row.  To display the list of products in a grid, we have created another style sheet   called ts-responsive-web-style.css, as shown in the following code:  .ts-product-container{     text-align:center; } .ts-product-container .ts-product{     display: inline-block;     height: 250px;     margin: 10px 40px;  [ 36 ]   Chapter 2      width: 200px;     background: eee;     font-weight: bold; }       The HTML code for the list of products is shown in the following code:               Responsive product Store                                                       product                                                           product                                                           product                                                           product                                                         product                                 [ 37 ]   Creating a Responsive Layout for a Web Application                           product                                                                product                                                        product                                                          product                                                         product                                                         product                                                         product                                                         product                                                         product                        [ 38 ]   Chapter 2                                    product                                                         product                                                         product                                                         product                                                         product                                                         product                                                         product                                                         product                                                         product                                             [ 39 ]   Creating a Responsive Layout for a Web Application               product                                             The list of products will be rendered as shown in the following screenshot:  The .container and .container-fluid classes are for  proper alignment and padding.

The initial window of the emulator has different sections:     The window listing different devices, for example, HTC, Samsung, Sony   Ericson, Motorola, and Nokia, as shown in the following screenshot:     The Profile section has the list of devices that can be selected and used    for testing  [ 45 ]   Creating a Responsive Layout for a Web Application     The Resolution field represents the width and height of the screen, as shown   in the following screenshot:     The Pixel Density field represents the pixels per inch on the device's screen     The User Interface field has the Touch, tablet, and keyboard options    The User Agent String field has options such as Meego, Android,    and Desktop     The Window Scale field has 25%, 50%, 100%, and 200% options to scale    The Arguments option is for passing additional arguments  The whole screen will look like the following screenshot. Developers can choose  different options and configure the testing window screen. These options are really  helpful to test the application on a different emulated device.  [ 46 ]   Chapter 2  The emulator will open in a new window. The following screenshot shows the home  page for the emulator:  [ 47 ]   Creating a Responsive Layout for a Web Application  For the first time, we need to accept the agreement to open the browser.   The following screenshot shows the initial state of the browser:  The Opera browser has many different options, which are as follows:     The address bar: This element is for passing the URL of the application    for browsing.     The forward and backward button: This element is in the footer    section. These buttons are used to navigate forward and backward   in the browser history.     The refresh button: This element is present in the footer. This button is used   to reload a page in the browser.     The full screen option: This element is also present in the footer. It can be   used for full size of the screen for the emulator.  [ 48 ]   Chapter 2  The different menu options present inside the Opera emulator are as follows:     Bookmarks: This is used to bookmark different URLs    History: This contains all the browsed pages    Start Page: This has the initial page containing a list of quick dial pages    Saved Pages: This has all the saved pages    Downloads: This has the list of the downloaded files    Settings: This can change the browser settings such as privacy and    proxy settings     Find in Page: This is used to find text in the current page    Help: This has additional help for the browser    Exit: This is to exit the browser  The following screenshot shows the menu options that we discussed in the   preceding section:  [ 49 ]   Creating a Responsive Layout for a Web Application  The following screenshot shows the Samsung Galaxy S II Version of the emulator.  This emulator represents the following:     The number of products and as the screen size is very small, the number of   products is three in a single row     Each product has the property to be displayed with the inline-block value  [ 50 ]   The final layout will look like the following screenshot:  Chapter 2  [ 51 ]   Creating a Responsive Layout for a Web Application  Summary  In this chapter, we learned to set up a Java-based web project in the Eclipse Juno  environment, wireframe a web page using the draw.io online tool, and configure  Bootstrap 3 in a Java-based web project. We also understood the concepts of some   of the Bootstrap 3 layout classes such as the fixed and fluid containers and how to   set the Opera Mobile emulator. We also understood the different options in the  Opera Mobile emulator, and developed different components for a web page   such as the navbar, hero section, and product list.  In the next chapter, we will learn how to use the jQuery calls to get dynamic and  responsive content.  [ 52 ]   Adding Dynamic Visuals to a  Web Application  In this chapter, we will learn how to create servlets returning JSON data followed by  understanding the concepts of jQuery AJAX and promising and templating a library  to render data in our page. In the later section of this chapter, we will learn how to  create a carousel for the hero section.  Building a JSON servlet  In this section, we will develop a Java servlet that will return a list of products as  a JSON array. Before building the servlet, we need to create a Java class named  Product. This class is known as a Plain Old Java Object  POJO  as it does not  implement any interface or extend any other classes. This class will have many  different properties that we are going to use to store the corresponding values.  Creating a POJO class The value object of the Product class has all properties related to a product.   The different fields of a product are:     Title: This field contains the title of the product and is of the type string.    The getTitle   and setTitle   methods are two getter and setter methods.    Cost: This field contains the pricing of the product and is of the type integer.   The getCost   and setCost   methods are two getter and setter methods.    Description: This field contains the information about the product and is of  the type string. The getDescription   and setDescription   methods  are the two getter and setter methods.   Adding Dynamic Visuals to a Web Application     URL: This field contains the URI of the product image and is of the   type string. The getUrl   and setUrl   methods are two getter   and setter methods.     Type: This field contains the type of the product and is of the type string.  The getType   and setType   methods are two getter and setter methods.  The following code shows the implementation of all the preceding fields in the  Product Java class:  package com.packt.product.obj;  public class Product {          private String title;     private int cost;     private String description;     private String url;     private String type;          public String getTitle   {         return title;     }     public void setTitle String title  {         this.title = title;     }     public int getCost   {         return cost;     }     public void setCost int i  {         this.cost = i;     }     public String getDescription   {         return description;     }     public void setDescription String description  {         this.description = description;     }     public String getUrl   {         return url;     }     public void setUrl String url  {         this.url = url;     }     public String getType   {         return type;  [ 54 ]       }     public void setType String type  {         this.type = type;     } }  Chapter 3  Creating a product store Also, we need to create a list of products for our application. For the purpose of this  book, we have used the names of some of the Packt Publishing books and videos.  The getAllListedBook   and getAllListedVideo   methods are the two methods  that return list of the hardcoded products. It should be noted that in a real-world  application, these methods would tie into a database to retrieve the appropriate  records instead of having a hardcoded values.cerateStaticJSON   method that  takes the list of products and returns its JSON equivalent string. The conversion of  POJO to JSON is done by the GSON library. All these methods are written in the  ProductStore class, as shown in the following code:  package com.packt.product.store;  import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.List; import com.google.gson.Gson; import com.google.gson.GsonBuilder; import com.packt.product.obj.Product;  public class ProductStore {      public static List  getAllListedBook   {         List  listProduct = new ArrayList   ;          Product product2 = new Product  ;         product2.setTitle "Buddy press theme development" ;         product2.setCost 12 ;         product2.setDescription "Lorem ipsum dollar.Lorem ipsum  dollar.Lorem ipsum dollar." ;         product2.setUrl "asset image books 2.png" ;         product2.setType "book" ;          Product product3 = new Product  ;         product3.setTitle "Master Web Application Development with  AngularJS" ;         product3.setCost 14 ;  [ 55 ]   Adding Dynamic Visuals to a Web Application          product3.setDescription "Lorem ipsum dollar.Lorem ipsum  dollar.Lorem ipsum dollar." ;         product3.setUrl "asset image books 3.png" ;         product3.setType "book" ;          Product product4 = new Product  ;         product4.setTitle "Instant GSON" ;         product4.setCost 10 ;         product4.setDescription "Lorem ipsum dollar.Lorem ipsum  dollar.Lorem ipsum dollar." ;         product4.setUrl "asset image books 4.png" ;         product4.setType "book" ;          Product product5 = new Product  ;         product5.setTitle "jQuery UI Cookbook" ;         product5.setCost 17 ;         product5.setDescription "Lorem ipsum dollar.Lorem ipsum  dollar.Lorem ipsum dollar." ;         product5.setUrl "asset image books 5.png" ;         product5.setType "book" ;          Product product6 = new Product  ;         product6.setTitle "Learning IPython For Interactive Computing  And Data Visualization" ;         product6.setCost 13 ;         product6.setDescription "Lorem ipsum dollar.Lorem ipsum  dollar.Lorem ipsum dollar." ;         product6.setUrl "asset image books 6.png" ;          listProduct.add product2 ;         listProduct.add product3 ;         listProduct.add product4 ;         listProduct.add product5 ;         listProduct.add product6 ;          return listProduct;     }     public static List  getAllListedVideo   {         List  listProduct = new ArrayList   ;          Product product1 = new Product  ;         product1.setTitle "Fast Track to Adobe Captivate 6" ;         product1.setCost 12 ;         product1.setDescription "Lorem ipsum dollar.Lorem ipsum  dollar.Lorem ipsum dollar." ;  [ 56 ]   Chapter 3          product1.setUrl "asset image video 2.png" ;         product1.setType "video" ;          Product product2 = new Product  ;         product2.setTitle "Cassandra Administration" ;         product2.setCost 14 ;         product2.setDescription "Lorem ipsum dollar.Lorem ipsum  dollar.Lorem ipsum dollar." ;         product2.setUrl "asset image video 3.png" ;         product2.setType "video" ;          Product product3 = new Product  ;         product3.setTitle "Play! Framework For Web Application  Development" ;         product3.setCost 10 ;         product3.setDescription "Lorem ipsum dollar.Lorem ipsum  dollar.Lorem ipsum dollar." ;         product3.setUrl "asset image video 4.png" ;         product3.setType "video" ;          Product product4 = new Product  ;         product4.setTitle "Getting Started With magneto" ;         product4.setCost 17 ;         product4.setDescription "Lorem ipsum dollar.Lorem ipsum  dollar.Lorem ipsum dollar." ;         product4.setUrl "asset image video 5.png" ;         product4.setType "video" ;          Product product5 = new Product  ;         product5.setTitle "Building a Network Application With Node" ;         product5.setCost 13 ;         product5.setDescription "Lorem ipsum dollar.Lorem ipsum  dollar.Lorem ipsum dollar." ;         product5.setUrl "asset image video 6.png" ;         product5.setType "video" ;          Product product6 = new Product  ;         product6.setTitle "Oracle Apex Technique" ;         product6.setCost 13 ;         product6.setDescription "Lorem ipsum dollar.Lorem ipsum  dollar.Lorem ipsum dollar." ;         product6.setUrl "asset image video 7.png" ;         product6.setType "video" ;                  listProduct.add product1 ;  [ 57 ]   Adding Dynamic Visuals to a Web Application          listProduct.add product2 ;         listProduct.add product3 ;         listProduct.add product4 ;         listProduct.add product5 ;         listProduct.add product6 ;          return listProduct;     }  public static String cerateStaticJSON List   listOfProduct  {     Gson gson = new GsonBuilder  .setPrettyPrinting  .create  ;     String json = gson.toJson listOfProduct ;     return json;     } }  Converting from POJO to JSON In this section, we will convert our product list  that is a Java POJO array  to a JSON  array. We have used a GSON library from Google to covert the Java POJO objects  into a JSON string, as described in the following figure:  Java POJO  GSON  JSON  Some key points about JSON conversion in GSON are as follows:     A GSON object needs to be instantiated using a new keyword with   GsonBuilder and a create method     Using the toJson   method, a Java POJO object is converted to its    equivalent JSON string  Creating the servlet Now, the main servlet, ProductServlet, which reads the request parameter type,  calls the appropriate method, and sends the response in the JSON string, is shown   as follows:  package com.packt.product.data;  import java.io.IOException; import java.io.PrintWriter;  [ 58 ]   Chapter 3  import java.util.List; import javax.servlet.ServletException; import javax.servlet.annotation.WebServlet; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse; import com.packt.product.obj.Product; import com.packt.product.store.ProductStore;  @WebServlet " ProductServlet"  public class ProductServlet extends HttpServlet {     private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;     public ProductServlet   {         super  ;     }     protected void doGet HttpServletRequest request,  HttpServletResponse response  throws ServletException, IOException {           String type = request.getParameter "type" ;     List   listOfProduct = null;               if "book".equalsIgnoreCase type  {       listOfProduct = ProductStore.getAllListedBook  ;     }else if "video".equalsIgnoreCase type  {       listOfProduct = ProductStore.getAllListedVideo  ;     } String productJsonString = ProductStore.cerateStaticJSON listOfProdu ct ; response.setContentType "application json" ;     PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;     out.write productJsonString ;     } }  Some of the key points about ProductServlet are as follows:     ProductServlet reads the type parameter from the URL and based on the   type, it calls the ProductStore method to get the list of products. If the type is book, then it calls the getAllListedBook   method and if the  type is video, it calls the getAllListedVideo   method.         Finally, the createStaticJSON   method is called with a list of projects as   Java object to get converted into a JSON string. The generated JSON string is  then passed back as a response to the client using the PrintWriter method.  [ 59 ]   Adding Dynamic Visuals to a Web Application  All these servlet calls are the GET method by default, from the client. The following  screenshot shows the JSON data returned for the type book as a parameter in the  URL string:  [ 60 ]   The following screenshot shows the JSON array for type video as a parameter in   the URL string. The JSON array is an array of objects where each object represents   a JSON string that is equivalent to the object of a Product class.  Chapter 3  [ 61 ]   Adding Dynamic Visuals to a Web Application  Building a jQuery AJAX method  In this section, we will learn to develop a jQuery AJAX method in order to  make server calls. The following figure shows the block diagram of a typical  communication between a client and a server done through a sequence of   requests and responses, where each request is triggered by an AJAX call:  AJAX  Response  Request  Servlet  jQuery provides an AJAX method $.ajax   to call the remote data. For our  application, we will call our servlet ProductServlet to download the product list  in the JSON format. The AJAX method makes an XMLHttpRequest request to the  servlet to get the data.  The syntax for the AJAX method is shown as follows:  $.ajax  ,{configuration properties}   accept  Some of the configuration properties are described as follows:     accepts: This field represents the request method to use, such as GET or POST.   By default, if the parameter type is not specified, the call is assumed to be a  GET method request.     beforeSend: This field can be a function attached to it and uses a   preprocessing of requests before making the final call to the server resource.     cache: This field takes a Boolean value and represents the caching of   resources in the browser.  [ 62 ]   Chapter 3     crossDomain: This field takes a Boolean value and indicates whether a       request is a cross domain call. type: This field represents the request method to use, such as GET or   POST. By default if the type is not specified, the call is assumed to be   a GET method request.  To make an AJAX request via jQuery for all titles of type book, we can pass the type  as a GET request named as the query string's parameter. The following code shows a  function that takes the type parameter as an argument and makes the AJAX request  to the servlet accordingly:   *Returning jQuery Promise For a AJAX call with Product type*  getProductDetails : function type {   var ajaxRequest=$.ajax "ProductServlet?type="+type ;   return ajaxRequest.promise  ; }  The jQuery version that we have used for this application is 2.1.0. The method used  in the preceding code returns a promise object on debugging. We will see what this  promise object does in the next section.  Let's focus on the AJAX call for this method now. As the signature of the  getProductDetails   method suggests, it takes a string as a parameter   value and appends it to the URL with the type as a key.  The following screenshot shows the Firebug console of the jQuery AJAX call for   the type book:  [ 63 ]   Adding Dynamic Visuals to a Web Application  The following screenshot shows the Firebug console of the jQuery AJAX call for the  type video:  jQuery promises jQuery promises are a great mechanism to handle the asynchronous callback issue.  Some of the key points about jQuery promises are listed as follows:     A promise object represents the subset of a jQuery deferred object    A deferred object is nothing but a normal object whose state is not known    at present or is yet to be known in the future     A promise object provides a different callback method to handle its    future state  [ 64 ]   Chapter 3  AJAX call  Promise object  The preceding figure is a graphical representation of how a jQuery promise object  works for an AJAX call.  The promise   method returns the promise object for handling. In our script code,  we have used the done   callback method to handle the AJAX call's success state,   as shown in the following code:   *Handler For AJAX response*  handleCallback : function type {     var promise = PACKT_PRODUCT_APP.getProductDetails type ;     promise.done function data {             PACKT_PRODUCT_APP.doProductRendering data ;         } ;     }  [ 65 ]   Adding Dynamic Visuals to a Web Application  The jQuery templating mechanism jQuery provides a templating mechanism using an additional plugin called jquery. tmpl.min.js. Some of the important points about jQuery templating are as follows:     A jQuery template is wrapped around the   tag with type as    text x-jquery-tmpl. The syntax of a jQuery template is shown as follows:  " type="text x-jquery-tmpl">     HTML code goes here       An expression is represented within a dollar  $  sign with curly braces and is  used for representing the value of a JavaScript object in the string. The syntax  is shown as follows: ${ }     The tmpl   method is for template compilation and is used for linking the   data to produce the markup for a product.  The following figure shows a graphical representation of how jQuery templates  work. It has two phases, which are the internal compilation phase and the linking  phase, explored as follows:     The compilation phase: In this phase, the HTML template is compiled and   converted into a jQuery function     The linking phase: In this phase, the JSON data is passed to the compiled   jQuery method to generate the real HTML markup for rendering  HTML template  JSON data  HTML markup for  rendering  [ 66 ]   Chapter 3  Let's create our product template to use it in the web application. To begin with  templating, we need to decide which fields are to be displayed for a product while  rendering, as shown in the following code:                                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-certificate ts-cost- icon">                  ${cost}$                                           ${title}                                   Buy<  button>                    The HTML markup for a single product will render output as shown in the   following screenshot:  [ 67 ]   Adding Dynamic Visuals to a Web Application  The combined jQuery code The whole code for the web application is shown as follows, where PACKT_PRODUCT_ APP is the object that contains all methods for running the web application:  var PACKT_PRODUCT_APP={      *Returning jQuery Promise For a AJAX call with Product type*      getProductDetails : function type {           var ajaxRequest=$.ajax "ProductServlet?type="+type ;           return ajaxRequest.promise  ;     },      *Handler For AJAX response*      handleCallback : function type {         var promise = PACKT_PRODUCT_APP.getProductDetails type ;         promise.done function data {             PACKT_PRODUCT_APP.doProductRendering data ;         } ;     },      *jQuery Template building with JSON data*      doProductRendering: function data {         var productContainer =$ '.ts-product-container' ,             aProductTemplate = $ 'aProductTemplate' .tmpl  data  , promiseOldPro = $ productContainer .find '.panel' .fadeOut  . promise  ;          $.when promiseOldPro .then function  {             productContainer.html aProductTemplate ;         } ;     },      *Event Listener to Menu Item Click*      initCategoryClick:function  {         $ ".ts-bar" .on 'click','li',function e {             e.preventDefault  ;             var li = e.currentTarget,                 type= $ li .attr 'data-category' ;             $ li .siblings 'li' .removeClass 'active' ;             $ li .addClass 'active' ;             PACKT_PRODUCT_APP.handleCallback type ;         } ;     } };  $ document .ready function  {  [ 68 ]   Chapter 3       *Initial Load Call Books *      PACKT_PRODUCT_APP.handleCallback 'book' ;      *Initialize Click Of Menu Item*      PACKT_PRODUCT_APP.initCategoryClick  ; } ;  The document ready function is calling the two methods: handleCallback     and initCategoryClick  . Some key points about these methods are as follows:     handleCallback  : This method takes the book type as an input string to   load the page for the product type book.     initCategoryClick  : This method attaches a listener for menu click. When  a book or video menu item is clicked, it attaches the active class to the target  menu item and calls the AJAX for rendering the appropriate product type.  The combined HTML markup The combined code of the markup present in the index.html file is shown   as follows:                    Responsive product Store                                                           <button class="navbar-toggle collapsed" data-target="ts- top-menu"             data-toggle="collapse" type="button"><span class="sr- only">Navigation buttons   <a class="navbar-brand"  href="">PRODUCTS                        <!-- Collect the nav links, forms, and other content for  toggling -->  [ 69 ]   Adding Dynamic Visuals to a Web Application                                           <a  href="">Books                    Video                                                                                         <img class="img-responsive"  src="asset image hero 1.jpg">              <img class="img-responsive"  src="asset image hero 2.png">                                                                                   <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-certificate ts-cost- icon">                  ${cost}$                                           ${title}                                   Buy<  button>                           [ 70 ]   Chapter 3                      Modifying the style of the product In this section, we will modify the style of our product. This change is desirable.  There are two reasons to note, mentioned as follows:     Even in a static  nonresponsive  layout, titles may be long enough to wrap to  new lines, forcing the product title require multiple lines of height to display.  It is possible to get around with this issue by forcing the height of all titles,  but this will result in having unnecessary white spaces in the title area. In a fluid  responsive  layout, any content that varies in size, complicates the  process of aligning the content across breakpoints, properly.      We have used the ellipsis symbol  ...  when the title is too long to fill. This can be  achieved using the overflow, white-space, text-overflow, and width properties,   as shown in the following code:  .packt-app .ts-product-container .ts-product h5{     overflow: hidden;     white-space: nowrap;     text-overflow:ellipsis;     width:100%; }  The combined style code is shown as follows:  .packt-app .ts-product-container{     text-align:center;     position:relative; } .packt-app .ts-product-container .ts-product{     display: inline-block;     float: left;     margin: 10px 40px;     width: 200px;     background: eee;     font-weight: bold; } .packt-app .ts-product-container .ts-product .panel-body{     background: fff;  [ 71 ]   Adding Dynamic Visuals to a Web Application  } .packt-app .ts-product-container .ts-product .panel-footer{     height:48px;     padding: 6px 15px;     background: fff; } .packt-app .ts-product-container .ts-product img{     position: relative;     top: 0px; } .packt-app .ts-product-container .ts-product h5{     overflow: hidden;     white-space: nowrap;     text-overflow:ellipsis;     width:100%; } .packt-app .jumbotron{     background:transparent;     padding-left:0px; } .packt-app .glyphicon.glyphicon-certificate.ts-cost-icon{     font-size:50px;     z-index:2;      position: relative;     right: 20px;     top: 25px; } .packt-app .glyphicon.glyphicon-certificate.ts-cost-icon label{     color: FFA500;     font-size: 12px;     left: 16px;     position: absolute;     top: 13px;      }  The web application can be called using the following URL:   http:  localhost:8080 MyResponsiveWebApp index.html  [ 72 ]   Chapter 3  The output on our screen will look like the following screenshot:  [ 73 ]   Adding Dynamic Visuals to a Web Application  For the video type product, the screen will look like the following screenshot:  Building an image carousel  In this section, we will build an alternate version of our application's index.html  file that displays the hero section as a carousel. Bootstrap 3 provides the carousel  component based on jQuery.  Some of the key attributes about building a carousel are:     data-ride: This attribute is used for the carousel animation on page load    data-slide-to: This attribute is used for the carousel page indicator to   navigate to that page  [ 74 ]   Chapter 3     data-slide: This attribute represents the navigation of the next and the   previous item in the carousel  Some of the key classes of building carousel are:     carousel: This represents the class of the whole carousel container    carousel-inner: This class is the wrapper class for the inner carousel items    item: This represents each carousel element    carousel-control: This is the wrapper class for controls such as the      carousel-indicators: This is the page indicator that is shown as a    previous and next actions  rounded circle for pagination  The code for the carousel component is shown as follows:  <div id="carousel-packt-app" class="carousel slide" data- ride="carousel">          <li data-target="carousel-packt-app" data-slide-to="0"  class="">         <li data-target="carousel-packt-app" data-slide-to="1"  class="active">                                                                                   <a class="left carousel-control" href="carousel-packt-app" data- slide="prev">                  <a class="right carousel-control" href="carousel-packt-app" data- slide="next">                   [ 75 ]   Adding Dynamic Visuals to a Web Application  To position the carousel in the center of the page, we have included the margin-left  property of the carousel item.

We have also seen the use of jQuery promises to handle the callback issues  for the asynchronous method, the use of jQuery templates for compiling a HTML  template and building the rendering markup by linking the compiled template   with JSON data, and building a Carousel for the hero section.  In the next chapter, we will learn to integrate Twitter's social features into our   web application.  [ 79 ]    Twitter Integration  Social networking sites such as Twitter are the most powerful tool for online marketing  and lead generation for an e-commerce web application site. In this chapter, we will  learn how to integrate the Twitter4J API into our web application. We will also explore  the different features provided by Twitter4J.  Introduction to Twitter4J  Twitter4J is a Java library for developing Twitter-based Java applications. It is an  unofficial Twitter API. This can be downloaded from http:  twitter4j.org en  index.html. The library is zipped in a twitter4j-4.0.1.zip file. When unzipped,  it contains a lib folder containing all the required .jar files. The included .jar files  are listed as follows:     twitter4j-core-4.0.1.jar: This contains the core class for the    Twitter API.     twitter4j-stream-4.0.1.jar: This contains the API classes for streaming.  Threads can be created to consume the stream generated by listener classes  that implement Twitter.     twitter4j-async-4.0.1.jar: This contains API classes and the method for   asynchronous access to Twitter.     twitter4j-media-support-4.0.1: This contains API classes and the   methods to work with different media types.  We also need to download a dependent JAR file, commons-codec-1.9-bin,   from http:  commons.apache.org proper commons-codec .   Twitter Integration  Configuring Twitter4J in a web application  All of the previous JAR files need to be copied to the lib folder present inside the  WEB-INF directory. The following screenshot shows the WEB-INF directory containing  all the required JAR files for this application:  All these JAR files need to be added to the classpath. We can verify that these JAR  files are added to the application by looking in the Java Build Path option present  in the project properties. The following screenshot shows the build path with all the  Twitter4J JAR files added properly to our application:  [ 82 ]   Posting a tweet  In this section, we will learn how to tweet about a product using the Twitter4J API.  The approach to achieve this is as follows:  Chapter 4     Create a Twitter button    Set up a new Twitter application    Develop a Twitter servlet    Develop a Twitter callback servlet  The following diagram shows the important entities involved in a Twitter-based  client application. The arrow marks represent the communication between each  component while posting a tweet to a user timeline:  User Twitter  timeline  Twitter  application  s e r v l e t  jQuery  Creating a Twitter button In this section, we will create a Tweet button for each product. When this button is  clicked, a message is posted to the user's timeline about the product. The following  steps are executed to develop a Tweet button:  1.  Additional HTML markup is added to the jQuery product template as follows:            [ 83 ]   Twitter Integration                       ${cost}$                                   ${title}                  Buy<  button>      <button type="button" class="btn btn-info btn-block tweet-me"  data-bookTitle="${title}">Tweet             2.  Additional CSS styles are added to make the appearance of the Tweet button   similar to the Twitter theme. The change in style is as follows: .packt-app .btn.tweet-me{ background: 55acee; }  3.  An additional click event handler is added to the script, which will be   called when the Tweet button is clicked:  *Event Listener to Tweet Button Click*  initTwitterApp: function    {   $ ".ts-product-container" .on 'click', '.tweet-me', function  e  {     e.preventDefault  ;     var target = e.target, bookTitle = $ target .attr "data- bookTitle" , message = "I like this book ''" + bookTitle + "''  .What's your opinion?'", aReqTwitPromise = PACKT_PRODUCT_APP. postTwitAboutProduct message ;     aReqTwitPromise.done function  data  {       window.open data.url, "_self" ;     } ;   } ; },  *Calls the Servlet with message in parameter*  postTwitAboutProduct: function  message  {  [ 84 ]   Chapter 4    var aReqTwitPromise = $.ajax {     url: "TwitterServlet",     type: "POST",     data: {       msg: message     }   } .promise  ;   return aReqTwitPromise; }  The following screenshot shows the updated product with a Tweet button   on it. The Tweet button is present in the footer section of the product, and   the background color matches with the Twitter theme too:  [ 85 ]   Twitter Integration  Setting up a new Twitter application A new Twitter application needs to be created using the https:  dev.twitter. com apps new link. The following screenshot shows a blank form to register a   new application:  The form has various fields asking about the application details. For our application,  we have entered the name as MyResponsiveWebAppTwitClient, and the callback  URL is http:  127.0.0.1:8080 MyResponsiveWebApp TwitterCallbackServlet.  The following screenshot shows the filled form for our application:  [ 86 ]   Chapter 4  Finally, in the bottom section of the page, there is an application agreement.   The following screenshot shows the agreement for our new application.   By checking the checkbox, we are agreeing to the terms and conditions:  [ 87 ]   Twitter Integration  Once you have agreed to the agreement and clicked on the Create Your Twitter  application button, it will create and register the application. We can verify that  the application is listed in the   link. The following screenshot shows that the new  application is listed in the app list:  It generates the application ID, 5956893, for our application. If you click on the  application, it will navigate to the details page, https:  apps.twitter.com  app 5956893 show. This page has four different tabs: Details, Settings, API Keys,  and Permissions.  The Twitter Permissions tab The Permissions tab has all the settings related to the specific application. Every  Twitter application has the Read, Write and Access direct messages permission.  By default, each Twitter application has Read only access. Check out the following  screenshot showing the default permissions for the application:  For our application requirement, we need write access too. Select the third radio  button Read, Write and Access direct messages from the screen, and save the  settings using the Update settings button present at the bottom of the page:  [ 88 ]   Chapter 4  The Twitter Details tab The Details tab has all the details about the application, such as Access level, API  key, Callback URL, App-only authentication, Request token URL, Authorize URL,  and Access token URL, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 89 ]   Twitter Integration The Twitter Settings tab The Settings tab has all the details about the Callback URL, Name, Description,  Website, and Application icon. We can update all these details in this tab.   The following screenshot shows the content of this tab for our application:  The Twitter API Keys tab The API Keys tab has all the information about the keys that are being used by   the application to access Twitter user data. The following screenshot shows all   the content of this tab:  [ 90 ]   Chapter 4  Developing a Twitter servlet In the previous section, we registered our new Twitter application to post tweets  about our product to the respective user's timeline. The Twitter timeline posting  feature starts from the client side where the user needs to click on the Tweet button,  which calls a servlet, TwitterServlet.java, in the background to receive the  authorization URL of the application.  [ 91 ]   Twitter Integration  The following screenshot shows the new project structure. There are a few new Java  classes added to the project to enable Twitter application integration:  A Twitter application works by a set of token communications. The following  diagram shows the main building blocks of a Twitter application lifecycle:  Request token  Access token  User timeline  [ 92 ]   Request token Each registered Twitter application has an API key token and an API secret token.  These tokens when combined are known as a request token for the application. The  following diagram shows the two different keys combined to form a request token:  Chapter 4  API key  API  secret  Request  token  A request token is used to get the authorization URL for the application. In our  application, we have saved these tokens in the TwitterAppConfig.java file.   The code for TwitterAppConfig is listed as follows:  package com.packt.social.client; public interface TwitterAppConfig{    final static String TWIT_CONSUMER_KEY = "v6ig4X1aiL4sEWitUspLsw";    final static String TWIT_CONSUMER_SECRET_KEY =  "sRUJ3YyVPvUkM78Fv5cJONzf0ZwvGY7VXR96yFI94"; }  TwitterServlet is the middleware code for our application which will make use  of this request token to get the authorization URL. The steps involved to get the  authorization URL are explained in the following list of points:     A Twitter object needs to be created from TwitterFactory    The API key and secret string need to be added to create an OAuth consumer    This OAuth consumer is required to get an OAuth request token    This OAuth request token will generate the authorization URL for our   Twitter application  [ 93 ]   Twitter Integration  Additionally, we are saving the request token to reuse it on the callback servlet.   You can save it in persistent storage or as a user session object. The following  diagram shows a graphical representation of the preceding process:  TwitterFactory  API key  API secret  Twitter object  Request token  A TwitterUtil class is created so we have some reusable code for this application.  The code for this utility class is listed in the next code snippet. This utility has methods  for temporary storage of messages. In a real-time application, this can be optimized  with a better persistence mechanism. Have a look at the following code:  package com.packt.social.client; import java.io.InputStream; import twitter4j.auth.RequestToken; public class TwitterUtil {    public  static RequestToken reqToken =null;    public static String message;    public static InputStream imgStrem;    public static  void saveRequestToken RequestToken req, String msg   {       reqToken =req;       message = msg;    }    public static  void saveRequestToken RequestToken req, String  msg,InputStream imageStrem  {       reqToken =req;       message = msg;       imgStrem = imageStrem;    } }  [ 94 ]   The code for TwitterServlet.java is listed as follows:  Chapter 4  package com.packt.product.data; import java.io.IOException; import java.io.PrintWriter; import javax.servlet.ServletException; import javax.servlet.annotation.WebServlet; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse; import twitter4j.JSONException; import twitter4j.JSONObject; import twitter4j.Twitter; import twitter4j.TwitterException; import twitter4j.TwitterFactory; import twitter4j.auth.RequestToken; import com.packt.social.client.TwitterAppConfig; import com.packt.social.client.TwitterUtil; @WebServlet " TwitterServlet"  public class TwitterServlet extends HttpServlet implements  TwitterAppConfig {    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;     public TwitterServlet   {         super  ;          }    protected void doPost HttpServletRequest request,  HttpServletResponse response  throws ServletException, IOException {       Twitter twitter = new TwitterFactory  .getInstance  ;       twitter.setOAuthConsumer TWIT_CONSUMER_KEY, TWIT_CONSUMER_ SECRET_KEY ;       RequestToken requestToken = null;       String url = null;       String twitMsgPost = request.getParameter "msg" ;       try {       requestToken = twitter.getOAuthRequestToken  ;      * Saving the Request Token:     * Can be implemented in Database.  * In this example, we have saved the token      * in static field for the purposes of demonstration.     * For real implementation, please use other mechanisms.     *        TwitterUtil.saveRequestToken requestToken, twitMsgPost ;          url = requestToken.getAuthorizationURL  ;       } catch  TwitterException e {  [ 95 ]   Twitter Integration            e.printStackTrace  ;       }        response.setContentType "application json" ;        PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;        JSONObject reqToken = new JSONObject  ;         try {          reqToken.put "url", url ;          reqToken.put "token", requestToken.getToken   ;          reqToken.put "tokenSecret",requestToken.getTokenSecret   ;        } catch  JSONException e  {             e.printStackTrace  ;        }          out.write reqToken.toString   ;     } }  Developing a Twitter callback servlet A callback URL is required for a Twitter application. After successful authorization,  this is the location that the application returns to for further processing. While  creating the application, this callback option is present for configuration. For our  application, we have used http:  127.0.0.1:8080 MyResponsiveWebApp  TwitterCallbackServlet.  Access token An access token is used to post a tweet in the user timeline. An access token is made  up of a combination of oauth_verifier and an API secret.  OAuth veriﬁer  API secret  Access token  After authorization, the control returns to the callback servlet .The callback servlet  retrieves the request token saved in the storage. Using the request token and the  oauth_verifier key, it generates the access token. This OAuth token is then set   to a Twitter object to post the tweet or status in the user timeline.

Summary  In this chapter, we learned how to configure the Twitter4J API for a web  application, create a new Twitter client application to work with our web  application, and integrate the Twitter application to the web application   using Twitter4J, jQuery, and AJAX.  In the next chapter, we will learn how to integrate Facebook features to our   web application.  [ 111 ]    Facebook Integration  In this chapter, we will learn how to integrate Facebook into our responsive web  application. We will learn how to integrate different features, such as logging in   using a Facebook account and integrating a Like button into each product as well  as integrating comments. The presence of Facebook features enables users to share  information about the product on their timeline, which includes visibility of the   web application.  Introduction to the Facebook SDK for  JavaScript  In this section, we will learn how to configure the Facebook JavaScript SDK for  our application. There are no specific files to be downloaded to configure the SDK.  Facebook provides a JavaScript all.js file to call the Facebook API.       Facebook supports different locales for configuration. For our application,   we have called the US English locale. In the preceding script, en_US represents   the locale parameter.  This JavaScript file can be called in the bottom section of the body to be loaded.   It can also be called asynchronously by script injection. The following code shows   the code to load the JavaScript library asynchronously:     function d, s, id {    var js,         fjs = d.getElementsByTagName s [0];    if  d.getElementById id   {return;}    js = d.createElement s ;    js.id = id;   Facebook Integration     js.src = "  connect.facebook.net en_US all.js";    fjs.parentNode.insertBefore js, fjs ; } document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'  ;    There are some standard methods provided by the Facebook SDK that will be used  by the client application to use different features. The following diagram shows all  the methods supported by the Facebook SDK:  K D S B F     FB.init  FB.api  FB.ui  FB.login  FB.logout  FB.getLoginStatus  FB.getAuthResponse  FB.Event.subscribe  FB.Event.unsubscribe  [ 114 ]   Chapter 5  SDK method FB.init  FB.api FB.ui  FB.login  FB.logout FB.getLoginStatus  FB.getAuthResponse  FB.Event.subscribe  FB.Event. unsubscribe  Description This initializes the SDK with your Application ID  generated during configuration This is useful to make API calls to the Graph API This is used to trigger Facebook dialogs to the end user,  asking for various permissions This is used to log in to Facebook using the OAuth   dialog box This is used to log the user out from Facebook This is used to check whether the user is logged in and  authenticated for the application This method is similar to FB.getLoginStatus, but it is  synchronous and returns the authResponse object This method is used to subscribe to Facebook events  auth.login, auth.authResponseChange, and   auth.statusChange, and get callbacks to your   function when an event is fired This method is used to unsubscribe the specified   Facebook events  To initialize the Facebook SDK, the HTML markup must be present inside the page.  This HTML element is the base for the Facebook application's integration.  Creating a Facebook application  In this section, we will learn how to create and register a Facebook application.  Facebook provides a portal to register a new application. You can access this  application using the https:  developers.facebook.com apps link.   The following screenshot shows the page for the application:  [ 115 ]   Facebook Integration  You can see a button for creating a new application. You will then see the following  screenshot come up when you click on the Create New App button:  The preceding form is for creating a new application. It will ask for the Display  Name, Namespace, and Category of the application. We have filled in the form and  given the application name as MyResponsivePacktApp. The following screenshot  shows the completed form:  [ 116 ]   After filling in these input elements and clicking on the Create App button, it will  navigate you to the application dashboard. This dashboard has the application ID and  other details. The following screenshot shows the application ID for our application:  Chapter 5  Now, the application is listed, and you can see it present in the table. The following  screenshot shows the application as a card:  Configuring the Facebook SDK In this section, we will learn how to initialize the Facebook JavaScript SDK for   our application. The Settings tab of the Facebook application has all the fields   to configure our application based on our requirements.  [ 117 ]   Facebook Integration  The Settings tab The Settings tab has the configuration parameters such as domain name, site URL,  mobile site URL, and contact mail.

The key things that we have learned from this chapter are how   to initialize the Facebook SDK for the application, subscribe Facebook Events, and  use Facebook comments and Facebook features, such as Like and Share buttons,   in the application to promote products in social media.  In the next chapter, we will learn how to integrate the Google+1 feature into our   web application.  [ 136 ]   Google+ Integration  In this chapter, we will learn about the Google+ integration to our responsive web  application. We will understand how to integrate different features such as login  using a Google+ account and integrating a +1 button to each product. Integrating the  Google feature helps to promote the web application, which increases the probability  of a lead generation.  Introduction to the Google+ API  Google+ is another famous social network by Google Inc. The Google+ API  provides access to its features through the programming interface to integrate   in the web application. To access the API, we need to register a client application  in Google Developers Console. This developer console can be accessed by visiting  https:  console.developers.google.com. The following screenshot shows the  default view of the developer console:   Google+ Integration  We can see a Create Project button to register a new client application to access the  Google+ API. After clicking on this button, a new pop up is displayed on the screen  to register a new application. The following screenshot shows the window that  appears when you need to register a new application:  For our application, we have used Packt Responsive Application in the Project  name field and packt-responsive-app in the Project ID field. During the creation  of the application, there is one inner window showing the activities. The following  screenshot shows the activity window:  After successful creation of the client application, it will appear in the table.   The following screenshot shows the table with our client application listed in a row:  [ 138 ]   Configuring Google+  Google+ supports OAuth 2.0 access for its API. OAuth 2.0 allows users to share  specific data while keeping their usernames, passwords, and other information  private. Configuring the Google+ API on a web application needs the following   steps to be executed:  Chapter 6     Creating a client ID     Including Google script  Creating a client ID In this section, we will learn how to create a client ID for our application. To create  a new client ID, we need to go to the APIS & AUTH tab. The following screenshot  shows the details inside the APIS & AUTH section:  [ 139 ]   Google+ Integration  You can see a button to create a new application ID for our application. After clicking  on this button, a new window opens up to create the new application ID. In this  window, we have the following two important fields:     Authorized JavaScript origins: For development purposes, we have given  http:  localhost:8080 as the URL. This should be changed before going  live to a real domain name.     Authorized redirect URI: For development purposes, we have given    http:  localhost:8080 MyResponsiveWebApp as the URL. This URL  needs to be changed to a real domain path before going live.  The following screenshot shows the window that appears when you create the new  client ID:  [ 140 ]   After the successful creation of the client ID, it is listed on the page. The following  screenshot shows Client ID, Client secret, and other details about the application:  Chapter 6  Including the Google script We need to include a JavaScript library provided by the Google API in our  application. The JavaScript file client:plusone.js has all the required methods in  order to use Google+ features. We can include this file just before the   tag   to load the file synchronously. The following code shows the   tag in order  to load this file:   <  script>  Also, we can load this file asynchronously by using the script injection technique.  The following code loads the library asynchronously in our page:           function   {        var po = document.createElement 'script' ;  po.type = 'text javascript';  po.async = true;        po.src = 'https:  apis.google.com js client:plusone.js';        var s = document.getElementsByTagName 'script' [0];  s.parentNode.insertBefore po, s ;      }   ;    [ 141 ]   Google+ Integration  Log in using Google+ The Google+ Sign in button can be added using HTML markup or through  JavaScript. We will follow the markup approach for development. The following  HTML code shows the syntax to add the Google+ sign in the button:        <span       class="g-signin"       data-callback="signinCallback"       data-clientid="YOUR_CLIENT_ID"       data-cookiepolicy="single_host_origin"       data-scope="https:  www.googleapis.com auth plus.login">          The details of these attributes are listed as follows:     data-callback: This function is called when the Sign in button is rendered   and also after the sign in flow is complete.     data-clientid: This client ID is obtained from the Google       data-cookiepolicy: This parameter determines the policy for storing    Developers Console.  users' session information.     data-scope: This parameter takes the single or multiscope values. For   authentication purpose, login is the scope.  You can find an attribute in the previous code asking for the client ID. In the   Creating a client ID section, we created the client ID. We can use this client ID   in the previous markup.  More about this attribute can be found on https:  developers. google.com + web signin referencesign-in_button_ attributes.  The following code shows the markup for our application to add a Sign in button:        <span       class="g-signin"       data-callback="signinCallback"       data-clientid="781737073387-254c6ldrq9pcep1gs76tj92fr4dfdmri. apps.googleusercontent.com"  [ 142 ]         data-cookiepolicy="single_host_origin"       data-scope="https:  www.googleapis.com auth plus.login">          The preceding markup will create a Google+ sign in the button similar to the  following button:  Chapter 6  After clicking on this Sign in button, a pop-up window comes up asking for  permission from the user to authenticate the application. The following   screenshot shows the permission window for the Google+ authentication:  [ 143 ]   Google+ Integration  Integrating +1 recommendations  In this section, we will learn how to add a Google +1 button to our products. Before  integrating the Google +1 button, we have to change the product image URL for  the books to point to real live links. It is required for the demonstration of Google+  recommendations. The following code shows the getAllListedBook   method.   You can see that we have changed the image URL links to the images hosted on   the http:  www.packtpub.com website:  public class ProductStore {  public static List  getAllListedBook   {     List  listProduct = new ArrayList   ;     Product product3 = new Product  ;     product3.setTitle "Master Web Application Development with  AngularJS" ;     product3.setCost 14 ;     product3.setDescription "Lorem ipsum dollar.Lorem ipsum dollar.

An IFrame is created automatically around the +1 button markup. The main  reason to use an IFrame is that the other CSS will not hamper the style of the button.  The following screenshot shows the IFrame created for wrapping the +1 button:  [ 147 ]   Google+ Integration  After clicking on the +1 button, a pop-up window appears asking for the comment to  be written in the post.

In the next chapter, we will  explore the YouTube API that will be integrated into our web application.  Chapter 6  [ 149 ]    Linking Dynamic Content  from External Websites  In this chapter, you will learn how to integrate the YouTube API into our web  application. We will explore and learn to use the video-search feature for our web  application. Users of the web application can get an instant review and key features  of the product. This will help users in making a quick buying decision and increase  the number of leads.  Introduction to the YouTube API  YouTube provides three different APIs for a client application to access.   The following figure shows the three different APIs provided by YouTube:  YouTube API  Data API  Analytic API  Streaming API  Configuring a YouTube API  In the Google Developers Console, we need to create a client project. We will   be creating a new project, called PacktYoutubeapi. The URL for the Google  Developers Console is https:  console.developers.google.com.    Linking Dynamic Content from External Websites  The following screenshot shows the pop-up window that appears when you want to  create a new client project in the Developers Console:  After the successful creation of the new client project, it will be available in the  Console's project list. The following screenshot shows our new client project listed   in the Developers Console:  There is an option available to enable access to the YouTube API for our application.  The following screenshot shows the YouTube API listed in the Developers Console.  By default, the status of this API is OFF for the application.  [ 152 ]   To enable this API for our application, we need to toggle the STATUS button   to ON. The following screenshot shows the status of the YouTube API, which is   ON for our application:  Chapter 7  To access YouTube API methods, we need to create an API key for our client  application. You can find the option to create a public API key in the APIs & auth  section. The following screenshot shows the Credentials subsection where you can  create an API key:  [ 153 ]   Linking Dynamic Content from External Websites  In the preceding screenshot, you can see a button to create a new API key.   After clicking on this button, it provides some choices to create an API key, and   after the successful creation of an API key, the key will be listed in the Credentials  section. The following screenshot shows the API key generated for our application:  Searching for a YouTube video  In this section, we will learn about integrating a YouTube-related search video.  YouTube Data API Version 3.0 is the new API to access YouTube data. It requires   the API key that has been created in the previous section.  The main steps that we have to follow to do a YouTube search are:  1.  After adding the YouTube Search button, click on it to trigger the    search process.  2.  The script reads the data-booktitle attribute to get the title. This will serve   as a keyword for the search. Check the following screenshot for the HTML  markup showing the data-booktitle attribute:  [ 154 ]   Chapter 7  3.  Then, it creates an AJAX request to make an asynchronous call to the   YouTube API, and returns a promise object.  4.  After the successful completion of the AJAX call, the promise object is    resolved successfully.  5.  Once the data is available, we fetch the jQuery template for the search results   and compile it with a script function. We then link it to the search data  returned by the AJAX call and generate the HTML markup for rendering.  jQuery AJAX  YouTube Data API  jQ  uery romise  p  jQ  uery emplate  t  The base URL for the YouTube search is through a secure HTTP protocol,   https:  www.googleapis.com youtube v3 search. It takes different parameters  as input for the search and filter criteria. Some of the important parameters are   field and part.  [ 155 ]   Linking Dynamic Content from External Websites  The part parameter The part parameter is about accessing a resource from a YouTube API. It really  helps the application to choose resource components that your application actually  uses. The following figure shows some of the resource components:  s t r a p  The fields parameter The fields parameter is used to filter out the exact fields that are needed by the  client application. This is really helpful to reduce the size of the response.  For example, fields = items id, snippet title   will result in a small  footprint of a response containing an ID and a title.  The YouTube button markup We have added a button in our jQuery product template to display the search option  in the product. The following code shows the updated template:                                 <div class="fb-like" data-href="${url}" data- layout="button_count"                  data-action="like" data-show-faces="true" data- share="true">  [ 156 ]   Chapter 7                                                <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-certificate ts-cost- icon">                  ${cost}$                                           ${title}                                  <button type="button" class="btn btn-danger btn-block  packt-youtube-button" data-bookTitle="${title}">YouTube Search<  button>              Buy<  button>             <button type="button" class="btn btn-info btn-block twit- me" data-bookTitle="${title}" data-imgURI="${url}">Tweet                                <div class="g-plusone" data-width="180" data- href="${url}">                                   The following screenshot shows the updated product markup with a YouTube  button added to the product template:  [ 157 ]   Linking Dynamic Content from External Websites  Asynchronous search in YouTube When any user clicks on the YouTube Search button, a list of related videos will  appear at the top of the page. In this chapter, we are mainly focusing on the search  feature of YouTube using the keyword option. The query parameter that does this  work is q.

Rendering the YouTube search results We have created a separate jQuery template to represent individual search results.  Once the markup is ready to be rendered, we place the markup in a video container.  For this, we have added an additional row in our page layout. The following code  shows the additional row markup to render YouTube-related results in the page:               YouTube Related Search Video                                         The following code has the jQuery template to represent each video result in the list:          <li class="media btn-link youtube-video" data-videoId="${id. videoId}">               <img class="media-object" src="${snippet.thumbnails.default. url}" alt="${snippet.title}">                          ${snippet.title}                ${snippet.description}                [ 162 ]   The following screenshot shows YouTube's response rendered at the top of the page.  The search keyword is Cassandra Administration for a q parameter value. It  returns five results per page. We have only rendered the first page as an unordered  elements list.  Chapter 7  [ 163 ]   Linking Dynamic Content from External Websites  The jQuery code that implemented this search is listed in the following code:       *Returns a jQuery Promise Object For YouTube Search*      doYouTubeSearch : function searchKeyWord {         var baseUrl ="https:  www.googleapis.com youtube v3 search",             searchRequest = $.ajax {url:baseUrl,                 data:{                     q: searchKeyWord,                     part:"snippet",                     key :"AIzaSyBTYn7fvH1mpIKlw8W5K4Ju-hNaievd9Fs"                 }             } ;         return searchRequest.promise  ;     },      *Event Listener for click event YouTube search button*      initYouTubeButton : function  {         $ '.packt-app' .on 'click',' button.packt-youtube- button',function e {             var title = $ e.target .attr 'data-bookTitle' ,                 promisedData = PACKT_PRODUCT_APP. doYouTubeSearch title ;                 promisedData.done function data {                  *By Default, Initial result returns only 5 video,                   *other related video can be called using                  *Pagination info returned in the response                  *                  var videoItemArray = data.items;                 PACKT_PRODUCT_APP.doVideoRendering videoItemArray ;                 } ;         } ;     },     *jQuery Template building with JSON data*     doVideoRendering: function data {      var videoItemContainer =$ '.ts-video-container' ,          aVideoTemplate = $ 'aVideoTemplate' .tmpl  data  ,  promiseOldPro = $ videoItemContainer .find '.panel' .fadeOut  . promise  ;         $.when promiseOldPro .then function  {             $ '.youtube-video-container' .removeClass 'hide' ;             videoItemContainer.html aVideoTemplate ;         } ;     }  [ 164 ]   The Firebug inspection shows the following markup generated in the container:  Chapter 7  Embedding a YouTube video  There are different approaches to embed a YouTube video in an HTML page.  YouTube provides two different APIs to embed a video to a page: the JavaScript API  and IFrame API. In this section, we have used the IFrame API in order to embed the  video in our page. To use this API, we need to include the iframe_api API provided  by YouTube. The script code to include this API in our page is as follows:      [ 165 ]   Linking Dynamic Content from External Websites  We have added iframe in the container. When we click on one of the search results,  it receives the video ID and renders it on IFrame as a video. The jQuery code  performing this is listed as follows:  initVideoPlay: function  {     $ '.packt-app' .on 'click',' li.youtube-video',function e {       var videoId = $ e.currentTarget .attr 'data-videoId' ,         embedURL= "https:  www.youtube.com embed "+videoId;       $ 'iframeytplayer' .attr 'src',embedURL ;      } ;  }  The embedded URL has the format https:  www.youtube.com embed  .  IFrame takes this URL to render the video player of YouTube. We have added an  IFrame in the layout and kept it hidden initially. The following code shows the   IFrame embedded in the markup:                 YouTube Related Search Video                                              <iframe id="ytplayer" type="text html" width="100%"  height="300" src="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>            In the preceding code, the width of the IFrame is 100 percent. So, it will be a fluid  layout on the available size of the container. The following screenshot shows the  video player loaded with the target video on clicking the first item from the list of  video links:  [ 166 ]   Chapter 7  The HTML markup for the IFrame video player in Firebug looks like the   following screenshot:  [ 167 ]   Linking Dynamic Content from External Websites  After the integration of the video search feature of YouTube, the changed page will  look like the following screenshot:  [ 168 ]   Summary  In this chapter, we have learned about the YouTube API. We have seen how to create  a Google client API to use the YouTube data. We have also seen how to use jQuery  AJAX and promise to make a request to YouTube videos. Also, we have explored   the YouTube provided IFrame API to embed videos in our page. In the next chapter,  we will integrate a payment system into our web application.  Chapter 7  [ 169 ]    Integrating E-Commerce or  Shopping Applications with  Your Website  In this chapter, you will learn how to integrate a third-party e-commerce or   shopping API to your web application. You will also learn how to integrate the  PayPal pay feature into the products. We will also explore and get introduced   to the Shopify application.  Creating a shopping cart In this section, we will develop an Add to Cart feature in our application. A real  shopping cart has many features, but for the purpose of our application, we will  develop a minimal shopping cart. The features that we are going to develop in this  section are as follows:     Adding a product to the cart    Displaying the minimal view of the cart    Displaying the cart details in a table  Adding a product to the cart A new button is added to every product template; this button is labeled as   Add To Cart. The modified jQuery template is listed as follows:                      Integrating E-Commerce or Shopping Applications with Your Website               <div class="fb-like" data-href="${url}" data- layout="button_count" data-action="like" data-show-faces="true" data- share="true">                                               <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-certificate ts-cost- icon">                  ${cost}$                                           ${title}                                  <button type="button" class="btn btn-danger btn-block  packt-youtube-button" data-bookTitle="${title}">YouTube Search<  button>             <button type="button" class="btn btn-info btn-block add- to-cart" data-bookTitle="${title}" data-cost="${cost}">                                                     Add To Cart                           <button type="button" class="btn btn-info btn-block twit- me" data-bookTitle="${title}" data-imgURI="${url}">Tweet                                <div class="g-plusone" data-width="180" data- href="${url}">                                     The attributes used in the button are listed as follows:     data-cost: This attribute contains the cost of the product    data-bookTitle: This attribute contains the name of the book  [ 172 ]   The modified product with the new Add To Cart button will look like the   following screenshot:  Chapter 8  Displaying the minimal view of the cart In this section, we will develop the minimal view of a shopping cart. A minimal view  is very useful for an end user, as it shows the summary of response in an instant.   A minimal view in our application has the following features:     Counter: This component shows the number of products added at present by   the user. The default count is 0.     Click event: This event is attached to the button and displays the details of   the cart in a table.  [ 173 ]   Integrating E-Commerce or Shopping Applications with Your Website  The HTML markup for the minimal cart view is listed as follows. The Bootstrap 3  classes, glyphicon and glyphicon-shopping-cart, are used to produce a cart   icon for the cart:               <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-shopping-cart pull-left cart- icon">MyCart         0         The following screenshot shows the minimal view of the shopping cart for   our application:  Displaying the cart details in a table In this section, we will develop a detailed shopping cart view. When a user clicks on  the minimal cart view, a pop-up window appears with a table containing the entire  product list that is added to the cart by the user.  The HTML code for the pop-up window with modal is listed as follows.

These classes are listed as follows:     modal: This class indicates the start point of a modal markup    modal-dialog: This class adds styling similar to a dialog box    modal-content: This class indicates the content area of the dialog    modal-header: This class styles the header of the modal    modal-footer: This class indicates the footer area of a modal  The jQuery template for the detailed table of the cart is listed as follows:                                   My Cart Details                                   Sr No               Item Name               Price USD                                 {{each ITEMS}}                         1                ${title}                ${cost}                    {{ each}}                                             Total                              ${TOTALCOST} USD                       [ 175 ]   Integrating E-Commerce or Shopping Applications with Your Website      <button type="button" class="btn btn-danger btn-block pay-button"  data-cartAmount="${TOTALCOST}">         Pay With Paypal            In the preceding code, we have used Bootstrap 3's utility classes for the tables and  buttons. Details of these classes are listed as follows:     To style the table, we have used the following classes:  table: This class is used for basic styling such as padding and for  inserting the horizontal divider table-responsive: This class is used to make the table responsive active: This class is for the color that appears when you hover over   a particular row or cell     To style the button, we have used the following classes:  btn: This class is used for the basic styling of the button btn-danger: This class is used for the background color of the button btn-block: This class is used for the size of the button with 100  percent width                       The jQuery code to create and update the shopping cart is listed as follows:  Product:function title,cost {         this.title = title;         this.cost = cost;     },          MY_CART:[],          addToMyCart: function product {         var cartCount = $ '.cart-count' ;         $ '.packt-app' .on 'click','.add-to-cart',function e {             var target = $ e.target ,                 title = $ target .attr 'data-bookTitle' ,                 cost = parseInt $ target .attr 'data-cost' ,10 ,                 product = new PACKT_PRODUCT_APP.Product title, cost ,                 isExist = PACKT_PRODUCT_APP.isExist product.title ;                 if !isExist {                     PACKT_PRODUCT_APP.MY_CART.push product ;                 }else{  [ 176 ]   Chapter 8                      alert "Item already Exist In you cart." ;                 }             cartCount.html PACKT_PRODUCT_APP.MY_CART.length ;         } ;     },          getTotalCost : function  {         var sum =0;         $.each PACKT_PRODUCT_APP.MY_CART,function index, product {             sum += product.cost;         } ;         return sum;     },  *This method checks whether an item is already present inside the  cart or not*      isExist: function title {         var isExist =false;         $.each PACKT_PRODUCT_APP.MY_CART,function index, product {             if title === product.title {                 isExist = true;             }         } ;         return isExist;     },  *This method has listener for the cart button click and display the  modal*      showMyCart : function  {         $ '.packt-app' .on 'click','.btn-cart',function e {             var data ={                 "ITEMS":PACKT_PRODUCT_APP.MY_CART,                 "TOTALCOST":PACKT_PRODUCT_APP.getTotalCost                   },                 cartTemplate = $ 'myCartTemplate' .tmpl data ;                 $ 'my-cart .modal-body' .html cartTemplate ;             $ 'my-cart' .modal 'show' ;         } ;     }  [ 177 ]   Integrating E-Commerce or Shopping Applications with Your Website  All these methods are present inside the PACKT_PRODUCT_APP object.

Configuring the PayPal Developer API  In this section, we will configure the PayPal Developer API in our application for the  payment process. To access the PayPal API, we need to create a client application in  the Developer's Console. The developer link for the console is https:  developer. paypal.com. The following screenshot shows the Developer Console to create a new  PayPal application:  [ 178 ]   Chapter 8  For our application, we have created a PayPal client application named  PacktPaymentApp. Once the client application is created successfully, it will   be listed in the dashboard along with its details. The following screenshot   shows the details of our client application registered in PayPal:  [ 179 ]   Integrating E-Commerce or Shopping Applications with Your Website  On the APP DETAILS page, we can get the client's ID and a secret key for use.   We can also configure the return URL for the application. A return URL is the  location where the client application will return on success. The following   screenshot shows the form to configure the return URL:  Integrating the PayPal Developer API  In this section, we will integrate the PayPal SDK into our application. The PayPal  SDK has two JAR files to be included in the project. It can be downloaded from  https:  github.com paypal rest-api-sdk-java. The details of the two JAR   files that are to be included in the project are as follows:     paypal-core-1.6.0.jar: This JAR file has all the core classes for the    PayPal payment     rest-api-sdk-0.9.0.jar: This JAR file consists of all the classes that are   required to convert it into a REST-based access  [ 180 ]   The following screenshot shows the JAR files added to the classpath of our project:  Chapter 8  For the integration of the PayPal payment in the application, we have created some  Java classes for the shopping cart payment.

The following screenshot shows the toolbar of the  application that we created:  The best thing about Shopify is that it has all the features made available to the  admin user by its admin pages. This reduces the code development efforts that  users might need to put in. We can access the admin page for our application using  https:  myresponsivepacktshop.myshopify.com admin. We can add a product  using the Products tab. The following screenshot shows the form to add a product:  [ 192 ]   Chapter 8  Once the product is added, it will be listed in the products list. The following  screenshot shows the product that was mentioned earlier added to our list:  We can also customize the theme and add new features, or create a new application  based on the project's requirement. In this chapter, we are not covering all the details  about Shopify, as the chapter's main aim is to provide the readers with details about  integrating payments into their application.  [ 193 ]   Integrating E-Commerce or Shopping Applications with Your Website  Summary  In this chapter, we learned how to implement key features such as the  implementation of a shopping cart with a minimal and detailed view and   how to configure the PayPal payment API. We also briefly explored the Shopify   API and its configuration. In the next chapter, we will learn to develop Google's  Currency Converter API along with the web application.  [ 194 ]   Integrating the Google  Currency Converter with   Your Web Application  In this chapter, you will learn how to integrate the Currency Converter API into your  web application. You will also learn how to build the Google Currency Converter API  using a JAR file and integrate it into your shopping cart to change the currency type.  The Google Currency Converter API  Google provides a Currency Conversion API for Java-based projects. This API is  really helpful to get equivalent currency amounts within custom applications.   The link for this project is https:  code.google.com p currency-converter- api . The following screenshot shows the project page in Google Code:   Integrating the Google Currency Converter with Your Web Application  The source code for this project is available at http:  currency-converter-api. googlecode.com svn trunk . The following screenshot shows the source page of  Currency Converter:  The source code can be copied to your local filesystem using SVN checkout. Before  you check out, you need to install SVN on your system. The command for SVN  checkout is shown in the following screenshot:  [ 196 ]   Chapter 9  To get a JAR file from this source, we need to configure Maven in the development  system; then, we can run a Maven installation. Maven is a tool that can now be   used to build and manage any Java-based project. Maven is based on the concept   of a Project Object Model  POM . To find out more about Maven, go to   http:  maven.apache.org what-is-maven.html.  The following screenshot shows the command prompt running the mvn installation  for the currency project:  Maven's base command is mvn, and it takes a number of switch options to perform  different application-related tasks. Some of these options are listed as follows:     clean: This option cleans the files and directories generated by Maven   during its build     install: This option installs the built artifact into the local repository    deploy: This option deploys the built artifact to the remote repository    compile: This option compiles Java sources  The mvn clean install command will generate the required currency- converter-api-1.0.jar JAR file. We can also use the pom.xml dependency   markup to install and build the JAR file. The following code shows the POM  dependency code for a Maven-type project:       com.tunyk.currencyconverter     currency-converter-api     1.0     [ 197 ]   Integrating the Google Currency Converter with Your Web Application  Configuring the Google Currency  Converter API  In this section, we will configure the currency JAR file in our application. There are  four dependency JAR files that are required to be added in order to configure the  currency JAR file. The required JAR files are ehcache, log4j, slf4j, and slf4j log.  The following figure shows the versions of these JAR files that have been used in   this chapter:  ehcache-core-  2.4.5.jar  log4j-1.2.14.jar  currency-converter-  api-1.0.jar  slf4j-api-1.5.10.jar  slf4j-log4j12-  1.5.10.jar  The API documentation for this library can be found at http:  currency- converter-api.googlecode.com svn apidocs index.html.  Integrating the Currency Converter API  In this section, we will integrate the Currency Converter JAR libraries into our  web application. In the previous section, we generated the libraries needed for the  configuration. All these JAR files must be added to the classpath of the project. To  bundle these libraries with the web application, we added them to the lib folder  present in the WEB-INF directory. The following screenshot shows the JAR files  present inside the lib folder:  [ 198 ]   Chapter 9  Developing our currency converter  In our application, we will provide a feature for currency conversion in the shopping  cart. This will help the end user to compare the total cost with other currencies.  For this reason, we will create a jQuery template that has a drop-down menu that  contains a list of the currencies supported by the API. When a user selects one of  the currencies, he or she makes an AJAX call to find the equivalent value of the  total amount of the shopping cart in that currency type. To build this converter  component, we have to go through the following steps:  1.  Building the currency list dropdown. 2.  Processing the conversion request.  Building the currency list dropdown In this section, we will develop a dropdown with all the currencies supported  by the Google Currency API. This API has a com.tunyk.currencyconverter. api.Currency enum with the list of currencies as constants. We have built  a servlet named AllCurrencyListServlet.java that is called when the  page loads to retrieve the list of currencies as a JSON array. The code for  AllCurrencyListServlet is as follows:  package com.packt.product.data;  import java.io.IOException; import java.io.PrintWriter; import javax.servlet.ServletException; import javax.servlet.annotation.WebServlet; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse; import com.packt.social.client.GoogleCurrencyUtil;  @WebServlet " AllCurrencyListServlet"  public class AllCurrencyListServlet extends HttpServlet {          private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;        public AllCurrencyListServlet   {         super  ;     }  [ 199 ]   Integrating the Google Currency Converter with Your Web Application      protected void doGet HttpServletRequest request,  HttpServletResponse response  throws ServletException, IOException {         String currencyListJsonString = GoogleCurrencyUtil. getCurrencyList  ;         response.setContentType "application json" ;         PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;         out.write currencyListJsonString ;     } }  In the previous servlet, we called a method, getCurrencyList  , from the  GoogleCurrencyUtil.java class. This method uses the GSON library to convert the  currency's enum values to the JSON array. The code for this method is as follows:  package com.packt.social.client;  import java.util.Arrays; import java.util.List; import com.google.gson.Gson; import com.tunyk.currencyconverter.BankUaCom; import com.tunyk.currencyconverter.api.Currency; import com.tunyk.currencyconverter.api.CurrencyConverter; import com.tunyk.currencyconverter.api.CurrencyConverterException;  public class GoogleCurrencyUtil {      **      * Returns Currency list as JSON String      * @return      *      public static String getCurrencyList  {         List  list = Arrays.asList Currency.values   ;         Gson gson = new Gson  ;         String json = gson.toJson list ;         return json;     } }  The following code snippet represents the jQuery template of the currency converter:                     Convert Currency To   [ 200 ]   Chapter 9                                    {{each currency}}                    ${$value}  {{ each}}                                                       The following screenshot shows the currency converter dropdown populated with  all the supported currencies:  [ 201 ]   Integrating the Google Currency Converter with Your Web Application  The following screenshot shows the response from the servlet call to get all the  currency types as a JSON array:  The jQuery script code to download and compile the template is as follows:  getAllCurrencyList: function  {         var ajaxRequest=$.ajax {             url:" AllCurrencyListServlet"         } ;         ajaxRequest.done function data {             var aConverterTemplate = $ 'currencyConverterTemplate' . tmpl  {"currency":data} ;             $ 'my-cart .modal-footer' .html aConverterTemplate          } ;     }  [ 202 ]   Chapter 9  In the previous code, the getAllCurrencyList   method makes an AJAX request  to the AllCurrencyListServlet servlet to load the currency list. Once the response  arrives, the converter template is compiled and linked with the response data to  build the markup for the converter's dropdown.  Processing the conversion request In this section, we will develop the real request that is passed to the servlet for  processing. A jQuery event listener is attached to the change event on the currency  dropdown, which is shown as follows:  changeCurrencyValue : function  {                  $ '.packt-app' .on 'change','currencyConverter',function e {             var target = e.target,                 selectedValue = $ target .val  ,                 totalCost = PACKT_PRODUCT_APP.getTotalCost  ,                 promisedCurrency = PACKT_PRODUCT_APP.requestCurrencyVa lue totalCost,selectedValue ;                 promisedCurrency.done function data {                     $ 'equivalent-currency' .html data.value ;                 } ;         } ;      },     requestCurrencyValue : function amount,currencyType {                  var ajaxRequest=$.ajax {             url:" ConvertCurrencyServlet",             method:"POST",             data:{                 "amount":amount,                 "currencyType":currencyType             }         } ;         return ajaxRequest.promise  ;     }  In the preceding code, an AJAX request is made to ConvertCurrencyServlet   as a post method using a parameter. The following screenshot shows the request  parameters that get posted to the server when a user selects a currency type from   the dropdown.   [ 203 ]   Integrating the Google Currency Converter with Your Web Application  The amount parameter represents the total value of the cart in USD, and the  currencyType parameter represents the user-selected currency type.  The code for the ConvertCurrencyServlet servlet is as follows:  package com.packt.product.data;  import java.io.IOException; import java.io.PrintWriter; import javax.servlet.ServletException; import javax.servlet.annotation.WebServlet; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse; import com.google.gson.JsonObject; import com.packt.social.client.GoogleCurrencyUtil; import com.tunyk.currencyconverter.api.Currency;  @WebServlet " ConvertCurrencyServlet"  public class ConvertCurrencyServlet extends HttpServlet {     private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;             public ConvertCurrencyServlet   {         super  ;     }     protected void doPost HttpServletRequest request,  HttpServletResponse response  throws ServletException, IOException {  [ 204 ]   Chapter 9          String amount = request.getParameter "amount" ;         String targetCurrency = request.getParameter "currencyType" ;         Float floatAmount = GoogleCurrencyUtil. convertStringToFloat amount ;         Currency currencyType = GoogleCurrencyUtil.getCurrencyType ta rgetCurrency ;         float currencyListJsonString = GoogleCurrencyUtil.convertCurre ncy floatAmount,currencyType ;         response.setContentType "application json" ;         PrintWriter out = response.getWriter  ;         JsonObject jsonObject = new JsonObject  ;         jsonObject.addProperty "value", Float.toString currencyListJso nString +" "+targetCurrency ;         out.write jsonObject.toString   ;     } }  In the preceding servlet, we used the GoogleCurrencyUtil methods to perform  some repetitive tasks. The code for these methods is as follows:  package com.packt.social.client;  import com.tunyk.currencyconverter.BankUaCom; import com.tunyk.currencyconverter.api.Currency; import com.tunyk.currencyconverter.api.CurrencyConverter; import com.tunyk.currencyconverter.api.CurrencyConverterException;  public class GoogleCurrencyUtil {       **      * ConverCurrency to Float      * @param amount      * @param currency      * @return      *      public static float convertCurrency Float amount,Currency  currency {         CurrencyConverter currencyConverter = null;         Float otherCurrencyValue = null;         try {             currencyConverter = new BankUaCom Currency.USD, currency ;             otherCurrencyValue = currencyConverter. convertCurrency amount ;         } catch  CurrencyConverterException e  {             e.printStackTrace  ;  [ 205 ]   Integrating the Google Currency Converter with Your Web Application          }          return otherCurrencyValue;     }           **      * Return an Equivalent Enum Currency type for      * a String type currency      * @param currencyType      * @return      *      public static Currency getCurrencyType String currencyType {         return Currency.valueOf currencyType ;              }      **      * Convert String to Float      * @param amount      * @return      *      public static Float convertStringToFloat String amount {         return Float.valueOf amount ;              } }  The response of the servlet is a JSON string with a property name value that contains  the equivalent currency value. The following screenshot shows the Firebug console  with a response from the server:  [ 206 ]   Once the response arrives at the browser, the AJAX success handler gets executed  and the equivalent currency type is displayed in a pop-up window. The following  screenshot shows the pop-up window with a converted currency value:  Chapter 9  The following screenshot shows the HTML markup in the Firebug console for the  currency converter:  [ 207 ]   Integrating the Google Currency Converter with Your Web Application  Exceptions  In this section, we will learn about the different exceptions that are supported by  this API. It has two exception classes, namely CurrencyConverterException and  CurrencyNotSupportedException, as shown in the following screenshot:  Exception  CurrencyConverterException  CurrencyNotSupportedException  The two exception classes are explained as follows:     CurrencyConverterException: This exception generally occurs when an   improper input is given to a conversion API     CurrencyNotSupportedException: This exception occurs when the targeted   currency type is not supported by the API  We can find the list of currency types supported by the API at http:  currency- converter-api.googlecode.com svn apidocs com tunyk currencyconverter  api Currency.html.  Summary  In this chapter, we learned how to configure the Google Currency Converter  API, make AJAX requests to these API services, and integrate the API with a web  application as a feature to help the end user check the equivalent currency value of  the cart at that period of time. In the next chapter, we will be introduced to a list of  online and offline tools to test responsive applications.
