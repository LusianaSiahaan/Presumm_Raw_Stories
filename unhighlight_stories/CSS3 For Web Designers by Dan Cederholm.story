When one  person designs in Photoshop and another converts the design  to markup and CSS, the coder must make guesses and assump- tions about what the designer intended. This interpretive  process is never without friction—unless the coder is Dan  Cederholm. When Dan codes other people’s designs, he gets  everything right, including the parts the designer got wrong.  For instance, Dan inevitably translates a designer’s fixed   Photoshop dimensions into code that is flexible, accessible,  and bulletproof.  Indeed, Dan coined the phrase “bulletproof  web design” while teaching the rest of us how to do it.    In Dan’s case, flexible never means sloppy. The details always  matter. That’s because Dan is not only a brilliant front-end  developer and user advocate, he is also a designer to his core.  He dreams design, bleeds design, and even gave the world   a new way to share design at dribbble.com. Dan is also a   born teacher and funny guy whose deadpan delivery makes  Steven Wright look giddy by comparison. Dan speaks all over,   helping designers improve their craft, and he not only edu- cates, he kills.  And that, my friends, is why we’ve asked him to be our  and  your  guide to CSS3. You couldn’t ask for a smarter, more  experienced, more design-focused guide or a bigger web stan- dards geek than our man Dan. Enjoy the trip!  —Jeffrey Zeldman    1 USING    CSS3 TODAY  Looking back upon the storied history of css, we see  some important milestones that have shaped our direction  as web designers. These watershed techniques, articles, and  events helped us create flexible, accessible websites that we  could be proud of both visually as well as under the hood.  You could argue that things began to get interesting back  in 2001, when Jeffrey Zeldman wrote “To Hell With Bad  Browsers”  http:  bkaprt.com css3 1  ,1 signaling the dawn of  the CSS Age. This manifesto encouraged designers to push  forward and use CSS for more than just link colors and fonts,  leaving behind older, incapable browsers that choked on  CSS1. Yes, CSS1.  We spent the next several years discovering and sharing tech- niques for using CSS to achieve what we wanted for our cli- ents and bosses. It was an exciting time to be experimenting,   1. The long URL: http:  www.alistapart.com articles tohell       USING CSS3 TODAY    1    pushing boundaries, and figuring out complex ways of han- dling cross-browser rendering issues—all in the name of in- creased flexibility, improved accessibility, and reduced code.  Somewhere around 2006 or so, the talk about CSS went quiet.  Most of the problems we needed to solve had documented  solutions. Common browser bugs had multiple workarounds.  We created support groups for designers emotionally scarred  by inexplicable Internet Explorer bugs. Our hair started to  gray.  OK, I’m speaking for myself here.  Most importantly  though, the contemporary crop of browsers was relatively  stagnant. This period of status quo gave us time to craft reus- able approaches and establish best practices, but things got  a little, dare I say, boring for the CSS aficionado yearning for  better tools.  Thankfully things changed. Browsers began iterating and up- dating more rapidly  well, some of them anyway . Firefox and  Safari not only started to gain market share, they also thrived  on a quicker development cycle, adding solid standards sup- port alongside more experimental properties. In many cases,  the technologies that these forward-thinking browsers chose  to implement were then folded back into draft specifications.  In other words, periodically it was the browser vendors that  pushed the spec along.  BUT DON’T READ THE SPEC Ask a roomful of web designers, “Who likes reading specs?”  and you might get one person to raise their hand.  If you are  that person, I commend you and the free time you apparently  have . Although they serve as important references, I certainly  don’t enjoy reading specifications in their entirety, nor do I  recommend doing so in order to grasp CSS3 as a whole.  The good news is that CSS3 is actually a series of modules that  are designed to be implemented separately and independently  from each other. This is a very good thing. This segmented      2   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   approach has enabled portions of the spec to move faster  or  slower  than others, and has encouraged browser vendors to  implement the pieces that are further along before the entirety  of CSS3 is considered finished.  The W3C explains the module approach:  Rather than attempting to shove dozens of updates into a single  monolithic specification, it will be much easier and more efficient  to be able to update individual pieces of the specification. Modules  will enable CSS to be updated in a more timely and precise fash- ion, thus allowing for a more flexible and timely evolution of the  specification as a whole.2   The benefit here for us web designers is that along with ex- perimentation and faster release cycle comes the ability to  use many CSS3 properties before waiting until they become  Candidate Recommendations, perhaps years from now.  Now, by all means, if you enjoy reading specifications, go for  it! Naturally there’s a lot to be learned in there—but it’s far  more practical to focus on what’s currently implemented and  usable today, and those are the bits that we’ll be talking about  in the rest of this chapter. Later, we’ll apply those bits in ex- amples throughout the rest of the book.   I’ve always learned more about web design by dissecting  examples in the wild rather than reading white papers, and  that’s what we’ll stress in the pages that follow.  CSS3 IS FOR EVERYONE I’ve been hearing this quite a bit from fellow web designers  across the globe: “I can’t wait to use CSS3 … when it’s done.”  But the truth is everyone can begin using CSS3 right now. And   2. http:  www.w3.org TR css3-roadmap whymods      USING CSS3 TODAY    3    fortunately you don’t have to think differently or make drastic  changes to the way you craft websites in order to do so. How  can anyone use CSS3 on any project? Because we’re going to  carefully choose the situations where we apply CSS3, focusing  squarely on the experience layer.  Targeting the experience layer If we’ve been doing things right over the past several years,  we’ve been building upon a foundation of web standards   semantic HTML and CSS for layout, type, color, etc. , leav- ing much of the interaction effects—animation, feedback,  and movement—to technologies like Flash and JavaScript.  With CSS3 properties being slowly, but steadily introduced in  forward-thinking browsers, we can start to shift some of that  experience layer to our stylesheets.   As an interface designer who leans heavily toward the visual  side of design rather than the programmatic side, the more   I can do to make a compelling user experience using already- familiar tools like HTML and CSS, the more I do a happy   little dance.   CSS3 is for web designers like you and I, and we can start   using portions of it today, so long as we know when and how  to fold it in.  When to apply CSS3 In terms of a website’s visual experience, we could group  things into two categories: critical and non-critical  table 1.01 .  Areas like branding, usability, and layout are crucial to   any website’s success, and as such utilizing technology   that’s not fully supported by all browsers would be a risky  venture there.  For example, in the evolving CSS3 spec there are multiple  drafts for controlling layout—something we drastically need.      4   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   CRITICAL  Branding  Usability  Accessibility  Layout  NON-CRITICAL  Interaction  Visual Rewards  Feedback  Movement  table 1.01: A website’s visual experience can be grouped into critical and non-critical   categories. The latter are where CSS3 can be applied today.  We’ve been bending the float property to handle layout for  years now. We’ve figured out how to get by with what we  have, but a real layout engine is absolutely a necessity.  That said, two of the three new CSS3 layout modules have yet  to be implemented by any browser. They’re still being worked  out, and arguably are still confusing, difficult to grasp, and  likely not the final solution we’ve been looking for. Most im- portantly, for something as important as layout, CSS3 just isn’t  the right tool. Yet.  On the opposite end of the spectrum are non-critical events  like interaction  hover, focus, form elements, browser   viewport flexibility , and visual enhancements that result   from those interactions  along with animation . It’s far less  crucial to match an identical experience between browsers   for events like these, and that’s why it’s a perfect opportunity  to apply certain portions of CSS3 here for browsers that sup- port them now.  It’s atop these non-critical events where we’ll be applying  CSS3 throughout the book, keeping the more important char- acteristics of the page intact for all browsers, regardless of  their current CSS3 support.  When we decide to focus on and target these non-critical       USING CSS3 TODAY    5    areas of the visual experience, it becomes incredibly freeing to  layer on CSS3 and enrich the interaction of a website without  worrying that the core message, layout, and accessibility will  be hindered.   CORE CSS3 PROPERTIES   THAT ARE USABLE TODAY So, while we’ve pinpointed the experience layer as a place we  can safely apply CSS3 today, we’ll also want to pinpoint which  CSS3 properties we can use. That is, which portions of the  spec have a reached enough of a browser implementation tip- ping point to be practical and usable right now.  Large chunks of CSS3 have not yet been implemented in any  browser. Things are still being worked out. We can be curious  about those chunks that are in flux, but we’re better off focus- ing our attention on what actually works, and lucky for us  there’s a fair amount now that does.  Let’s take a quick look at the relatively small set of core CSS3  properties that we’ll be using in the examples in the book   below, and table 1.02 . I’m merely introducing them here, as  we’ll be digging much deeper into advanced syntax and real- world usage later.  border-radius Rounds the corners of an element with a specified radius  value. Supported in Safari 3+, Chrome 3+, Firefox 1+, Opera  10.5+, and IE9 Beta. Example:   .foo {    border-radius: 10px;    }     6   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   text-shadow A CSS2 property  dropped in 2.1 then reintroduced in CSS3   that adds a shadow to hypertext, with options for the direc- tion, amount of blur, and color of the shadow. Supported in   Safari 1.1+, Chrome 2+, Firefox 3.1+, and Opera 9.5+. Example:  p {    text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px 999;    }  PROPERTY  border-radius  text-shadow  box-shadow  opacity  RGBA  Multiple background images  SUPPORTED IN  3+  3+  1+  10.5+  9 beta  1.1+  2+  3.1+  9.5+  3+  3+  3.5+  10.5+  9 beta  1.3+  2+  3.6+  10.5+  9 beta  1.2+  1+  1.5+  9+  9 beta  3.2+  3+  3+  10+  9 beta  table 1.02: CSS3 properties and the browsers that support them.      USING CSS3 TODAY    7    box-shadow Adds a shadow to an element. Identical syntax to text-  shadow. Supported in Safari 3+, Chrome 3+, Firefox 3.5+,  Opera 10.5+, and IE9 Beta. Example:  .foo {    box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px 999;    }  Multiple background images CSS3 adds the ability to apply multiple background images on  an element  separated with commas , as opposed to just one  as defined in CSS2.1. Supported in Safari 1.3+, Chrome 2+,  Firefox 3.6+, Opera 10.5+, and IE9 Beta. Example:  body {    background: url image1.png  no-repeat top left,    url image2.png  repeat-x bottom left,    url image3.png  repeat-y top right;    }  opacity  Defines how opaque an element is. A value of 1 means com- pletely opaque, while a value of 0 means fully transparent.  Supported in Safari 1.2+, Chrome 1+, Firefox 1.5+, Opera 9+,  and IE9 Beta. Example:  .foo {    opacity: 0.5;  * .foo will be 50% transparent *     }  RGBA Not a CSS property, but rather a new color model introduced  in CSS3, adding the ability to specify a level of opacity along  with an RGB color value. Supported in Safari 3.2+, Chrome 3+,  Firefox 3+, Opera 10+, and IE9 Beta. Example:     8   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   .foo {    color: rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.75 ;  * black at 75% opacity *     }  Now that list is far from exhaustive, of course. CSS3 contains  many more properties and tools, many of which are still be- ing developed and are not yet implemented in any browser.  But you’ll notice that each property in the previous list has a  reached a certain threshold of browser support: it works in at  least two of the major browsers. And in some cases, support is  promised in future versions of Internet Explorer  and Opera .  So we now have a nice concise list of properties to play with,  based on their relatively decent support in Safari, Chrome,  Firefox, and Opera. They don’t work across the board yet,  and we’ll be discussing why that’s OK, and how to plan for  that non-uniform support later in the book.  What we aren’t going to cover I’ve listed the handful of CSS3 properties that we’ll be using  often in the book, but what about the rest? I’ve chosen not to  exhaustively cover everything here, but rather what’s practi- cally usable right now because it has decent, stable browser  support.  There are also other portions of the CSS3 spec that might be  usable today, but are out of the scope of this book  and might  warrant a book entirely on their own :  1.  Media Queries  http:  www.w3.org TR CSS3-mediaqueries   2. Multi-Column Layout  http:  www.w3.org TR CSS3-multicol   3. Web Fonts  http:  www.w3.org TR CSS3-webfonts      Be sure to check out these other modules after you’ve finished  reading this book.      USING CSS3 TODAY    9    VENDOR-SPECIFIC PREFIXES I mentioned earlier that the CSS3 specification is a series of  modules that are being slowly rolled out by browser vendors.  In some cases this rolling out involves experimental support.  That is, while the spec is being written, debated, and hashed  out at the W3C, a browser maker might choose to add sup- port for certain properties anyway, testing it in a real-world  environment. It’s become a healthy part of the process, where  feedback from experimental usage is often used to make ad- justments to the spec.  Alternatively, a browser vendor might want to introduce an  experimental property that’s not part of any proposed stan- dard, but may become one at a later date.  Often this experimental support for CSS properties is handled  by the use of a vendor prefix like so:  -webkit-border-radius  This dash-prefixed keyword attached to the beginning of the  property name flags it as a work-in-progress, specific to the  browser’s implementation and interpretation of the evolving  spec. If and when the experiment becomes part of a finished  CSS3 module, the browser should support the non-prefixed  property name going forward.  Each browser vendor has their own prefix, essentially  namespacing their experimental properties. Other browsers  will ignore rules containing prefixes they don’t recognize.  Table 1.03 shows the most widely-used vendors and their as- sociated prefixes, and we’ll be using the WebKit, Mozilla, and  Opera prefixes as they pertain to CSS3 in the examples in the  chapters ahead.     10   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   WebKit    Mozilla  Opera  Konqueror  Microsoft  Chrome  –webkit–  –moz–  –o–  –khtml–  –ms–  –chrome–  table 1.03: The most widely-used vendors and their associated prefixes.  How vendor prefixes work Here’s how vendor-prefixed CSS works in practice; we’ll use  the border-radius property as an example. Say we wanted  to round the corners of an element with a radius of 10 pixels;  here’s how we’d do it:  .foo {    -webkit-border-radius: 10px;    -moz-border-radius: 10px;    border-radius: 10px;    }  WebKit  the engine behind Safari, mobile Safari, and Chrome   and Gecko  the engine behind Firefox  browsers each support  the border-radius property by way of their own vendor-  prefixed versions, while Opera supports the property with-  out a vendor prefix. IE9 will also support border-radius  without a vendor prefix.       USING CSS3 TODAY    11    Optimal ordering When using vendor prefixes, it’s important to keep in mind  the order in which you list rules in your declarations. You’ll  notice in the above example that we listed the vendor-prefixed  property first, followed by the non-prefixed CSS3 property.   Why put the actual CSS3 property last? Because your styles  will likely work in more browsers in the future, progressively  enhancing your designs going forward. And when a browser  finally implements support for the property as defined in the  specification, that real property will trump the experimental  version since it comes last in the list. Should the implementa- tion for the vendor-specific version differ from the real prop- erty, you’re ensuring that the final standard reigns supreme.  Don’t be afraid of vendor prefixes!  Your initial reaction might be one of, “Blech, this is messy,  proprietary stuff!” But I assure you, not only is it a way for- ward, it’s much less messy than the code bloat and inflex- ibility that often come along with non-CSS3 solutions, and an  important part of the evolution of the specification as well.   By using these properties now via vendor prefixes, we can test  the waters, even giving valuable feedback to browser makers  before the spec is final. Remember, too, that the prefixes are  usually attached to proposed standards. That’s a big difference  from other hackish CSS we’ve all periodically used to solve  cross-browser issues.   Some might compare vendor prefixes to the syntax exploits  many of us have used to target specific browser versions  for  example, using w\idth: 200px or _width: 200px to target  specific versions of IE . But rather, vendor prefixes are an im- portant part of the standards process, allowing the evolution of a  property in a real-world implementation.     12   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   As CSS expert Eric Meyer explains in “Prefix or Posthack” on  A List Apart  http:  bkaprt.com css3 2  :3  Prefixes give us control of our hacking destiny. In the past, we   had to invent a bunch of parser exploits just to get inconsistent  implementations to act the same once we found out they were  inconsistent. It was a wholly reactive approach. Prefixes are a   proactive approach.  He goes on to suggest that vendor prefixing is not only posi- tive, but should be made more central to the standards pro- cess, and would:  … force the vendors and the Working Group to work together to  devise the tests necessary to determine interoperability. Those  tests can then guide those who follow, helping them to achieve  interoperable status much faster. They could literally ship the   prefixed implementation in one public beta and drop the prefix   in the next.  So, don’t fret over vendor prefixes. Use them knowing you’re  a part of a process that allows you to get work done today, and  paves the way toward a future when prefixes can be dropped.  What about all that repetition? You might think it’s silly to have to repeat what seems like  the same property three or four times for each vendor, and I  might agree with you.   But the reality is that non-CSS3 solutions would likely re- quire inflexible and more complex code, albeit perhaps  non-repetitive.  3. http:  www.alistapart.com articles prefix-or-posthack       USING CSS3 TODAY    13    We won’t need to repeat ourselves forever. For now, it’s a nec- essary but temporary step to keep potentially varying imple- mentations between browsers separate from the final spec  implementation.  Before we start doing compelling things with the handful of  usable CSS3 properties and their respective vendor prefixes,  let’s get a basic grasp on CSS transitions. Understanding tran- sitions and how they operate will help us combine them with  other properties to create wonderful experiences.     14   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   2 UNDERSTANDING   CSS TRANSITIONS  it was 1997 and I was sitting in a terribly run-down apart- ment in beautiful Allston, Massachusetts. A typical late night  of viewing source and teaching myself HTML followed a day  of packing CDs at a local record label for peanuts  hence the  run-down apartment . I’m sure you can relate.  One triumphant night, I pumped my fist in sweet victory.  I’d just successfully coded my first JavaScript image rollover.  Remember those?  I still remember the amazement of seeing a crudely designed  button graphic I’d cobbled together “swap” to a different one  when hovered over by the mouse. I barely had a clue as to  what I was doing at the time, but making something on the  page successfully change, dynamically, was, well … magical.  We’ve come a long way over the past decade in regard to  interaction and visual experience on the web. Historically,  technologies like Flash and JavaScript have enabled animation,       UNDERSTANDING CSS TRANSITIONS    15    movement, and interaction effects. But recently, with brows- ers rolling out support for CSS transitions and transforms,  some of that animation and experience enrichment can now  be comfortably moved to our stylesheets.  My first JavaScript rollover back in 1997 took me several  nights of head scratching, many lines of code that seemed  alien to me at the time, and multiple images. CSS3 today en- ables far richer, more flexible interactions through simple  lines of code that thankfully degrade gracefully in the brows- ers that don’t yet support it.  As I mentioned in Chapter 1, we can start to use some CSS3  properties right now as long as we carefully choose the situ- ations in which to use them. The same could be said for CSS  transitions. They certainly won’t replace existing technolo- gies like Flash, JavaScript, or SVG  especially without broader  browser support —but in conjunction with the aforemen- tioned core CSS3 properties  and CSS transforms and anima- tions which we’ll cover later in the book , they can be used to  push the experience layer a notch higher. And most impor- tantly, they’re relatively easy to implement for the web design- er already familiar with CSS. It only takes a few lines of code.  I’m introducing CSS transitions early here in Chapter 2, as  we’ll be applying them to many of the examples later in the  book. Having a basic understanding of the syntax of transi- tions and how they work will be beneficial before we dig  deeper into a case study.  TAIL WAGGING THE DOG Initially developed solely by the WebKit team for Safari, CSS  Transitions are now a Working Draft specification at the  W3C.  CSS Transforms and CSS Animations share that same  lineage, and we’ll be talking about them in Chapters 4 and 6,  respectively.      16   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   This is a nice example of browser innovation being folded  back into a potential standard. I say potential since it’s merely  a draft today. However, Opera has recently added CSS transi- tions support in version 10.5 and Firefox has pledged support  for version 4.0. In other words, while it is a draft specification  and evolving, it’s stable enough for Opera and Firefox to be  taking it seriously and adding support for it. Most impor- tantly, CSS transitions are no longer proprietary Safari-only  experiments.  Let’s take a look at how transitions work, shall we? Like the  CSS3 properties discussed in Chapter 1, I’m only introducing  them here along with their basic syntax so you’ll have a good  handle on how they operate. Later, we’ll be doing all sorts of  fun things with transitions, using them to polish the examples  in the chapters ahead, and you’ll be up to speed on how tran- sitions properly fit into the mix.  WHAT ARE CSS TRANSITIONS? I like to think of CSS transitions like butter, smoothing out  value changes in your stylesheets when triggered by interac- tions like hovering, clicking, and focusing. Unlike real butter,  transitions aren’t fattening—they’re just a few simple rules in  your stylesheet to enrich certain events in your designs.  The W3C explains CSS transitions quite simply  http:    bkaprt.com css3 3  :1  CSS Transitions allow property changes in CSS values to occur  smoothly over a specified duration.   This smoothing animates the changing of a CSS value when  triggered by a mouse click, focus or active state, or any chang- es to the element  including even a change on the element’s  class attribute .  1.  The long URL: http:  www.w3.org TR CSS3-transitions       UNDERSTANDING CSS TRANSITIONS    17    A SIMPLE EXAMPLE Let’s start with a simple example, where we’ll add a transition  to the background color swap of a link. When hovered over,  the link’s background color will change, and we’ll use a tran- sition to smooth out that change—an effect previously only  possible using Flash or JavaScript, but now possible with a  few simple lines of CSS.  The markup is a simple hyperlink, like so:   Transition me!   Next, we’ll add a declaration for the normal link state with a  little padding and a light green background, followed by the  background swap to a darker green on hover  fig 2.01 :  a.foo {    padding: 5px 10px;    background: 9c3;    }  a.foo:hover {    background: 690;    }  fig 2.01: The normal and :hover   state of the link.  Now let’s add a transition to that background color change.  This will smooth out and animate the difference over a speci- fied period of time  fig 2.02 .   For the time being, we’ll use only the vendor-prefixed proper- ties which currently work in WebKit-based browsers  Safari  and Chrome  to keep things simple. Later, we’ll add vendor  prefixes for Mozilla and Opera.     18   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   a.foo {    padding: 5px 10px;    background: 9c3;    -webkit-transition-property: background;    -webkit-transition-duration: 0.3s;    -webkit-transition-timing-function: ease;    }  a.foo:hover {    background: 690;    }   fig 2.02: This figure shows the smooth transition of light green to darker green  background.  You’ll notice the three parts of a transition in the declaration:    	transition-property: The property to be transitioned  in this case,  the background property   	transition-duration: How long the transition should last  0.3  seconds   	transition-timing-function: How fast the transition happens over  time  ease   TIMING FUNCTIONS  OR, I REALLY WISH I’D  PAID ATTENTION IN MATH CLASS  The timing function value allows the speed of the transition  to change over time by defining one of six possibilities: ease,  linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, and cubic-bezier   which allows you to define your own timing curve .        UNDERSTANDING CSS TRANSITIONS    19    If you slept through geometry in high school like I did, don’t  worry. I recommend simply plugging in each of these timing  function values to see how they differ.   For our simple example, the duration of the transition is so  quick  just a mere 0.3 seconds  that it’d be difficult to tell the  difference between the six options. For longer animations, the  timing function you choose becomes more of an important  piece of the puzzle, as there’s time to notice the speed changes  over the length of the animation.   When in doubt, ease  which is also the default value  or   linear should work just fine for short transitions.  DELAYING THE TRANSITION  Going back to our example, transitions can be delayed from  the moment the trigger happens on screen. For example, let’s  say we wanted the background transition to happen half a  second after the link is hovered over. We can do that using the  transition-delay property.  a.foo {    padding: 5px 10px;    background: 9c3;    -webkit-transition-property: background;    -webkit-transition-duration: 0.3s;    -webkit-transition-timing-function: ease;    -webkit-transition-delay: 0.5s;    }  a.foo:hover {    background: 690;    }     20   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   SHORTHAND TRANSITIONS We could simplify the  non-delayed  declaration significantly  by using the transition shorthand property, which is the syn- tax we’ll be using in the examples later in the book.  a.foo {    padding: 5px 10px;    background: 9c3;    -webkit-transition: background 0.3s ease;    }  a.foo:hover {    background: 690;    }  Now we have a much more compact rule that accomplishes  the same result.  Shorthand transition with a delay If we wanted to add back in the half-second delay to the short- hand version of the transition, we can do that by placing the  duration value at the end of the rule, like this:  a.foo {    padding: 5px 10px;    background: 9c3;    -webkit-transition: background 0.3s ease 0.5s;    }  a.foo:hover {    background: 690;    }  Now sure, all of this wonderful transitioning works just fine  in WebKit browsers, but what about the others?      UNDERSTANDING CSS TRANSITIONS    21    BROWSER SUPPORT As I mentioned earlier, transitions were initially developed   by WebKit, and have been in Safari and Chrome since version  3.2, but Opera supports them as well in version 10.5  http:   bkaprt.com css3 4  2 and support has been promised in Firefox  4.0  http:  bkaprt.com css3 5  .3  Because of that present and near-future support, it’s important  to add the appropriate vendor prefixes so that our transitions  will work in more browsers as support is rolled out.  BUILDING THE FULL TRANSITION STACK Here’s a revised declaration, adding the –moz- and –o- prefixes  as well as the actual CSS3 transition property. Again, we’re  putting the non-prefixed property last in the stack to ensure  that the final implementation will trump the others as the  property moves from draft to finished status.  a.foo {    padding: 5px 10px;    background: 9c3;    -webkit-transition: background 0.3s ease;    -moz-transition: background 0.3s ease;    -o-transition: background 0.3s ease;    transition: background 0.3s ease;    }  a.foo:hover {    background: 690;    }  With that stack, we’ll be smoothing out that background   color change in current versions of Safari, Chrome, and   2.

TRANSITIONING STATES I remember being slightly confused when I first started play- ing around with CSS Transitions. Wouldn’t it make more  sense if the transition properties were placed in the :hover  declaration, since that’s the trigger for the transition? The an- swer is that there are other possible states of an element be- sides :hover, and you’ll likely want that transition to happen  on each of those without duplication.  For instance, you may want the transition to also happen  on the :focus or :active pseudo-classes of the link as well.  Instead of having to add the transition property stack to each  of those declarations, the transition instructions are attached  to the normal state and therefore declared only once.  The following example adds the same background switch to  the :focus state. This enables triggering the transition from  either hovering over or focusing the link  via the keyboard, for  example .   a.foo {    padding: 5px 10px;    background: 9c3;    -webkit-transition: background 0.3s ease;    -moz-transition: background 0.3s ease;    -o-transition: background 0.3s ease;    transition: background 0.3s ease;    }  a.foo:hover,  a.foo:focus {    background: 690;    }      UNDERSTANDING CSS TRANSITIONS    23    TRANSITIONING MULTIPLE PROPERTIES Let’s say that along with the background color, we also want  to change the link’s text color and transition that as well. We  can do that by stringing multiple transitions together, sepa- rated by a comma. Each can have their varying duration and  timing functions  fig 2.03 .  Line wraps marked ».   a.foo {    padding: 5px 10px;    background: 9c3;    -webkit-transition: background .3s ease, »      color 0.2s linear;    -moz-transition: background .3s ease, »      color 0.2s linear;    -o-transition: background .3s ease, color 0.2s linear;    transition: background .3s ease, color 0.2s linear;    }  a.foo:hover,  a.foo:focus {    color: 030;    background: 690;    }  fig 2.03: The normal and :hover   states of the link.  TRANSITIONING ALL POSSIBLE PROPERTIES An alternative to listing multiple properties is using the all  value. This will transition all available properties.  Let’s drop all into our simple example instead of listing   background and color separately. They’ll now share the   same duration and timing function.     24   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   a.foo {    padding: 5px 10px;    background: 9c3;    -webkit-transition: all 0.3s ease;    -moz-transition: all 0.3s ease;    -o-transition: all 0.3s ease;    transition: all  0.3s ease;    }  a.foo:hover,  a.foo:focus {    color: 030;    background: 690;    }  This is a convenient way of catching all the changes that hap- pen on :hover, :focus, or :active events without having to  list each property you’d like to transition.  WHICH CSS PROPERTIES   CAN BE TRANSITIONED? Now that we’ve successfully transitioned the background and  color of a hyperlink, there are many other CSS properties  that can be transitioned, including width, opacity, position,  and font-size. A chart of all the possible properties  and  their types  that can be transitioned is available from the W3C   http:  bkaprt.com css3 6  .4  The opportunities for wonderfully fluid experiences are clear.  We’ll be using several of these properties in conjunction with  transitions throughout our case study examples in the next  chapter and onward.  4.

You might be wondering, with not all browsers supporting  or  at least promising support for  CSS Transitions, why not use  a JavaScript solution to handle the animation? Popular frame- works such as jQuery, Prototype, and script.aculo.us have  enabled animations via JavaScript that work cross-browser for  some time now.  It all depends on how crucial the transitions are to the experi- ence. I’m stressing here in this little book that you can em- brace the simplicity and flexibility of CSS3 if you choose the  appropriate parts of the user experience to apply it: enriching  the interactions that happen on the page. Quite often, the ani- mation of these interactions when handled by CSS Transitions  aren’t integral to the brand, readability, or layout of the web- site. Therefore, a few simple lines of CSS to trigger a simple  animation that’s native to the browsers that support it  rather  than tapping into a JavaScript framework  seems like a smart  choice. And one I’m glad we have at our disposal.  BE SMART, BE SUBTLE Like all shiny new tools, it’s important to use transitions   appropriately. One can easily go overboard adding transitions  to everything on the page, resulting in some sort of annoying,  pulsating monster. It’s key to decide where transitions right- fully enrich the user experience and when they are just extra- neous noise. Additionally, making sure the speed of the transi- tion doesn’t slow down an otherwise snappy action from the  user is crucial. Use with care and caution.  For more thoughts on appropriate speeds for CSS transitions  and animations, see Trent Walton’s post on the subject: http:   bkaprt.com css3 7 .5  5. http:  trentwalton.com 2010 03 22 CSS3-in-transition      26   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   Now that we have a solid base knowledge of how CSS transi- tions work at a technical level, we can use them to smooth out  the experience layer in the examples that follow, beginning  with the very next chapter. Let’s get to it.      UNDERSTANDING CSS TRANSITIONS    27    3 HOVER-CRAFTING   WITH CSS3  we’ve spent the first two chapters in training, get- ting up to speed with what’s currently usable today in terms  of CSS3. We also talked about how the experience layer is cur- rently the most appropriate place to apply that usable CSS3.   To recap the important bits we’ve covered so far, let’s keep in  mind that:  1.  There are core CSS3 properties that are usable today. 2. Everyone can use these core properties in their own projects, espe-  cially when targeted at the experience layer.  3. Vendor prefixes allow us to push forward right now, helping test   in-flux properties in real-world contexts.  4. CSS Transitions are no longer proprietary experiments, but draft   specifications that other browsers are embracing. Let’s use ’em!  With all of this under our anti-gravity belts, it’s now time to  have fun with all our new tools, and put them to work in the  context of a full-page design.     28   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   OUR CASE STUDY For most of the following examples I’ll be using a fictional  case study I’ve designed: a humorous homage to all the things  left on the moon by the astronauts lucky enough to have trav- eled there  fig 3.01 . There’s a story behind the subject matter  that directly relates to the theme of this book, if you’ll bear  with me for just a bit.  fig 3.01: Our fictional case study, Things We Left on the Moon.  Messages in space and on the web In 1969, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became  the first humans to set foot on the moon. I’ve been a casual  fan of space travel and the NASA program, but hearing more  about the Apollo 11 mission around the fortieth anniversary  inspired me to read more about the history and events sur- rounding the landing. In particular, I was fascinated by all the       HOVER-CRAFTING WITH CSS3    29    stuff that was left on the moon and remains up there to   this day.  Out of all the objects that have been left behind, there’s one in  particular that I found extremely interesting, and it serves as a  wonderful example of user experience design. It’s a small, sili- con disc  about the size of a US half dollar . Etched on the disc  are goodwill messages from the leaders of over seventy coun- tries from around the world. You need a microscope to read  them, but limitations in regard to what the astronauts could  bring with them helped shape the design of a commemorative  object that could be left on the moon for future visitors to dis- cover  fig 3.02 .   NASA was, in a sense, designing an object using the latest  technology available at the time, for an unknown audience   fig 3.02: The small  about the size of a U.S. half-dollar  silicon disc left on the  moon by the Apollo 11 astronauts.  NASA courtesy of nasaimages.org      30   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   sometime in the future. Sound familiar?  Later, in 1977, a similar design problem was solved for the  Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft by way of the Golden  Record: a gold-plated copper phonograph record that con- tains audio, images, and diagrams from life here on Earth  fig  3.03 . In a sense the record is a message in a bottle to potential  civilizations beyond our solar system. On its case is etched, in  symbolic language, how to properly play the record, where in  the galaxy it came from, and other instructions.  Like the silicon disc still resting in moon dust, the Golden  Record was designed using the latest technology on hand at  the time it was made, for a user experience with numerous  unknowns. Would the alien retrievers of the record be able to  see, feel, and listen to its contents?   fig 3.03: The gold-plated outer case of the Golden Record, a phonograph record  aboard the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft.  Courtesy NASA JPL-Caltech       HOVER-CRAFTING WITH CSS3    31    We can learn a lot from the silicon disc left on the moon and  the Golden Record hurtling into deep space—that utilizing the  best technology possible can help support the message being  sent to a largely unknown audience.  As web designers, we too are sending messages in a bottle  when we create things for the web. We can make assumptions  about who will be reading them, what they’re actually capable  of understanding, etc.—but we’re never 100% informed. That  shouldn’t prevent us from using the best technology available  to deliver that message and the experience around it, letting  the experience degrade gracefully in older or less capable  devices.  Our job as designers is not to simply dress up the bottle and  make it look pretty, but rather to find ways to enrich the story  and enhance the message. CSS3 can help us do that today.  So now you know why our case study pays homage to those  messages left on the moon or floating through space. It’s time  to start dissecting the site, breaking it into bite-sized examples  as they pertain to CSS3. I find it helpful to collect all the tech- niques we’ll be discussing in a single place. You’ll be able to  reference this template and all the examples whenever you’d  like in a living, breathing, one-page website.  You can download the case study’s example code at   http:  CSS3exp.com code.  Each of the remaining chapters tackles a different set of exam- ples related to CSS3. Instead of attempting to be all inclusive,  telling you everything there is to know about CSS3, I’m doing  quite the opposite here: diving into very specific, targeted  examples, while showing how they work in a simulated con- text—quick takeaways that you’ll be able to apply immediately  and build upon after digesting these pages. Burp.     32   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   SURPRISE AND DELIGHT Part of what makes designing for the web so different and in- teresting as opposed to static media is interaction. Things can  react, move, and even surprise when experienced in pixels  rather than paper.  And it’s the interaction that’s so easily enhanced by CSS3 for  browsers that support it, yet not missed by those that don’t.  A wonderful example of surprising and delighting with CSS3  can be found on Dutch designer and developer Faruk Ateş’s  personal site  http:  farukat.es . In the sidebar is a list of links  to various social networks that, on hover, expand and come  alive with several CSS3 treatments and a smooth transition   fig 3.04 .  What looks like a normal list of text with images floated off  to the right turns into something far more interesting when   fig 3.04: The sidebar and hover treatment found on Faruk Ateş’s site.      HOVER-CRAFTING WITH CSS3    33    you interact with it. This is a prime example of enriching the  experience layer, and Faruk uses a variety of CSS3 properties  in order to make that happen  in the browsers that support  them .  Figure 3.05 shows the same default and hover state as viewed  in Internet Explorer 7, which doesn’t support CSS3 at all. But  you’ll notice that, while the hover state isn’t as polished, it’s  still a usable, readable, and functional experience—not to men- tion the default, non-hovered state is nearly identical.  fig 3.05: Viewed in IE7, Faruk Ateş’s site doesn’t feature the same visual treatment  via CSS3, but that’s perfectly OK.  Hovering over  or focusing on  an element is a wonderful  place to enhance things with CSS3. Users of Internet Explorer  will get a different experience  until it eventually folds in sup- port for CSS3 properties . But this alternate experience is per- fectly fine, not unexpected, and frankly IE users won’t know  what they’re missing.      34   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   That is, until they fire this up in their friend’s copy of Safari,  Chrome, Firefox, or Opera  and feel a flush of jealousy .  DO WEBSITES NEED TO BE EXPERIENCED   EXACTLY THE SAME IN EVERY BROWSER? It’s an important question  and an appropriate one to ask at  this point , and I attempt to answer it on this enormously long  domain  fig 3.06 : http:  dowebsitesneedtobeexperienced  exactlythesameineverybrowser.com.   fig 3.06: The curiously named http:  dowebsitesneedtobeexperiencedexactly  thesameineverybrowser.com.   Like Faruk’s example, it’s not until you start to interact with  the site that things get interesting. On the surface, the site  looks nearly identical in most browsers, but the moment you  move the mouse across the screen and text  fig 3.07 , a series       HOVER-CRAFTING WITH CSS3    35    of CSS3 properties, transitions, and transforms are applied to  make the experience a unique and memorable one.  fig 3.07: An enriched experience is revealed when the site is interacted with. Made  possible by our friend CSS3.  Once again, it’s within the experience layer that we’re pro- gressively enriching this web design. The core content,  readability, usability, and markup remain consistent and  uncompromised.  NAVIGATING THE MOON Let’s take the concept of adding CSS3 to the hover interactions  of a design right to our case study. I’ll walk us through the  creation of the top navigation of the site  fig 3.08 , where we  combine border-radius, text-shadow, RGBA, and CSS tran- sitions to create an experience that surprises and delights.     36   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   fig 3.08: The top navigation of our  case study, enriched with CSS3 when  hovered.  First, the markup Being good semanticians, we’ll markup the top navigation  with a good ol’ unordered list.         News        Things        Stuff        Junk        About       Nothing earth-shattering here of course—just an appropriate  structure we can use to start applying styles.  Floating the items First, let’s float the entire list and use a bit of padding to posi- tion it over to the right of the page; then, let’s also float each  list item.  nav {    float: right;    padding: 42px 0 0 30px;    }  nav li {    float: left;    margin: 0 0 0 5px;    }      HOVER-CRAFTING WITH CSS3    37    Figure 3.09 shows the result. Our list is now horizontal.  fig 3.09: A list of links, turned   horizontal by a few CSS rules.  Styling the link color with RGBA Next, let’s add some padding to each link, and change the  color to a semi-transparent white. We’ll use RGBA to assign  white  255, 255, 255  at 70% opacity  0.7 , letting the text  soak up some of the background color behind it  fig 3.10 .  nav li a {    padding: 5px 15px;    font-weight: bold;    color: rgba 255, 255, 255, 0.7 ;    }  fig 3.10: Links now styled with   RGBA, blending the text into   the background a bit.  Figure 3.11 shows a close up of the links, where the white  at 70% opacity via RGBA lets the background shine through,  ever so slightly.  Providing a backup for RGBA Now, while RGBA is an amazingly flexible way of specifying      38   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   color along with a level of opacity, it’s not supported in all  browsers. Current flavors of Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and  Opera all support it, and it’s available in Internet Explorer 9— but what about IE6–8?  fig 3.11: A zoomed-in view of the  semi-transparent links.  Here’s where specifying a backup color comes into play. When  using RGBA to assign color values, it’s good practice to specify  a solid color first, as a fallback for browsers that don’t yet sup- port RGBA.  nav li a {    padding: 5px 15px;    font-weight: bold;    color: ccc;    color: rgba 255, 255, 255, 0.7 ;    }  Browsers that do support RGBA will override the solid color  a  light gray ccc in this case , while browsers that don’t yet sup- port RGBA yet will ignore the RGBA rule.  So, an important point to remember: specify solid backups   for RGBA colors in a separate rule that appears before the  RGBA rule.  Adding text-shadow For one last addition to the link styling, let’s add a very subtle  text-shadow. We’ll use RGBA again here to define the shad- ow’s color, letting the semi-transparent black at 50% opacity  blend into the background behind it.      HOVER-CRAFTING WITH CSS3    39    nav li a {    padding: 5px 15px;    font-weight: bold;    color: ccc;    color: rgba 255, 255, 255, 0.7 ;    text-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.5 ;    }  Figure 3.12 shows a comparison of the text links without  text-shadow applied  left  and with text-shadow applied   right , as viewed in Safari. It’s an almost imperceptible detail,  yet the tiny shadow gives the text just enough “lift” off the  space background behind it.  Remember that text-shadow works in current versions of  Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. Browsers that don’t sup- port text-shadow  *cough* IE  will harmlessly ignore the rule.  No shadow, no problem.  With the text-shadow in place, we’re now free to move on   to the :hover treatment. And here’s where we’ll lean more  heavily on CSS3.  fig 3.12: Comparison of links   without text-shadow applied    left  and with text-shadow   applied  right .  Hover and focus styles We’re going to add a color change and background color to  the :hover state of each link. Once again, we’ll use RGBA to      40   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   set a semi-transparent white background behind the text   on :hover.  nav li a {    padding: 5px 15px;    font-weight: bold;    color: ccc;    color: rgba 255, 255, 255, 0.7 ;    text-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.5 ;    }  nav li a:hover,  nav li a:focus {    color: fff;    background: rgba 255, 255, 255, 0.15 ;    }  So, on :hover, we’re changing the text color to solid white,  and adding a background color of white at 15% opacity. I’ve  also gone ahead and declared this style for when links are  focused as well. Users navigating with the keyboard, for in- stance, will then see this change when each link is focused.  Figure 3.13 shows the new :hover  and :focus  state of the  links. Browsers that support RGBA will get the semi-transpar- ent white background behind brighter white text.  Rounding the hover with border-radius Going a step further, we could round the corners of the hover  background using the CSS3 border-radius property, creating  a pill shape for browsers that support it.  Remembering what we learned back in Chapter 1 about the  border-radius property and the vendor prefixes that enable  us to use it today, we can add our stack to the default link dec- laration like so:      HOVER-CRAFTING WITH CSS3    41    fig 3.13: Showing the   :hover state, now with   a semi-transparent   background via RGBA.  nav li a {    padding: 5px 15px;    font-weight: bold;    color: ccc;    color: rgba 255, 255, 255, 0.7 ;    text-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.5 ;    -webkit-border-radius: 14px;    -moz-border-radius: 14px;    border-radius: 14px;    }  nav li a:hover,  nav li a:focus {    color: fff;    background: rgba 255, 255, 255, 0.15 ;    }  Figure 3.14 shows the :hover background treatment now  with rounded corners via border-radius, which will be seen  in Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Opera, as well as IE9. And re- member, we’ve placed the non-prefixed border-radius prop- erty last in the list, ensuring the ultimate implementation will  trump the vendor-prefixed ones. For example, Safari 5 now  supports both the non-prefixed border-radius property as  well as –webkit-border-radius supported in Safari 4.  You might be wondering why I’m placing the border-radius  rules in the nav li a declaration and not in the nav li  a:hover declaration  where it’s being revealed . The answer  lies in the CSS transition we’re going to add next as a final bit  of polish.     42   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   fig 3.14: Rounding the   corners of the background   with border-radius.   Adding a transition Lastly, let’s take what we learned in Chapter 2 and add a tran- sition to the :hover and :focus on the nav links. This will  smooth out the appearance of the background pill, subtly  bringing it into focus behind the text. The transition will also  smooth out the text color change from semi-transparent white  to fully white  fig 3.15 .  fig 3.15: The easing in and out when the transition is in place.  Here, we’ll add the stack for transitions that currently work  in Safari, Chrome, Firefox  4.0 , and Opera, with the non-pre- fixed transition property last in the declaration for eventual  implementation by additional browsers  or future versions .  nav li a {    padding: 5px 15px;    font-weight: bold;    color: ccc;    color: rgba 255, 255, 255, 0.7 ;       HOVER-CRAFTING WITH CSS3    43      text-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.5 ;    -webkit-border-radius: 14px;    -moz-border-radius: 14px;    border-radius: 14px;    -webkit-transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;    -moz-transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;    -o-transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;    transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;    }  nav li a:hover,  nav li a:focus {    color: fff;    background: rgba 255, 255, 255, 0.15 ;    }  Remember that we add the transition properties to the normal  state of the element to be transitioned. Transitions are de- signed this way in order for the transition to happen not only  on :hover, but also on :focus or :active states as well.  I’m using the all value in our transition to catch all the   properties that change on :hover and :focus—color and  background in this case. Alternatively, we could’ve achieved  the same transition by listing each of those properties explic- itly in a comma-delimited list like this:  -webkit-transition:     color 0.3s ease-in-out,     background 0.3s ease-in-out;  -moz-transition:     color 0.3s ease-in-out,     background 0.3s ease-in-out;  -o-transition:     color 0.3s ease-in-out,     background 0.3s ease-in-out;  transition:     color .3s ease-in-out,     background .3s ease-in-out;     44   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   You can quickly see how the all value is a bit more compact  and efficient for transitioning multiple changes on an element.  Hover-crafting the experience We’ve just walked through a rather simple example, adding  various CSS3 properties to the experience layer. Browsers  that are capable will ease in a semi-transparent, rounded back- ground color behind text-shadowed text links. Browsers that  aren’t capable don’t get the enhanced hover experience, but  that’s perfectly OK. What they do get is a semantically-struc- tured horizontal list of links—and that foundation is what’s  most important here.   I think this little exercise also demonstrates how efficient it  is to achieve something that previously would have required  Flash and or JavaScript to achieve. The CSS rules that we used  are simple and straightforward, harmless for browsers that  don’t yet support them.   We’ve also future-proofed our CSS3 by ensuring that the   property from the spec is included last in our rules. Dup- licating these rules with the appropriate vendor-specific   prefixes is a necessary effort—but one where the payoff is  golden: getting to use CSS3 right now to enhance the experi- ence for many users.  SIMPLE AND FLEXIBLE HOVERING   USING OPACITY We’re constantly looking for solutions that save time and offer  additional flexibility. This is precisely what CSS3 offers us in  spades: the ability to achieve, in a few lines of code, what used  to take more time and resources to create and maintain.  Yet another tool for the hover-crafting arsenal is the opacity  property. As mentioned in Chapter 1, opacity is a CSS3 prop- erty that allows you to specify how opaque a given element       HOVER-CRAFTING WITH CSS3    45    is. Coupled with the aforementioned RGBA, opacity offers  another method to add transparency to the designs we create  for the web.   One of the ways I like to use opacity is to create simple and  flexible hover states for hyperlinked graphics, using the varia- tion in transparency to create multiple states from a single  image. Add a CSS transition into the mix and you now have a  wonderfully rich experience for linked graphics on the page  that’s easy to maintain.  Let’s take a look at how the opacity property is used on the  moon case study.  Opacity on clickable images Figure 3.16 shows the footer of the moon example site,  where, underneath some legal copy and a shocking disclaimer,  sit three clickable logos.  fig 3.16: The footer of Things We Left on the Moon.  We’re going to use the opacity property to not only control  the :hover and :focus treatment, but also to set the initial  level of transparency. And a CSS transition will smooth out  and animate that change for a complete effect.  The markup Like the previous top navigation example, the markup for  these footer logos is simple and semantic—just an unordered  list of hyperlinked images:     46   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS          <img src="img logo-sb.png" »       alt="SimpleBits logo"  >            <img src="img icon-feed.png" »      alt="RSS feed"  >            <img src="img icon-bitman.png" »       alt="BitMan"  >           Opacity and image efficiency  I’ve actually created the icons themselves as fully-white PNG  images, knowing that I can later use the opacity property to  adjust the level of transparency with CSS. This has changed  the way I think about graphic assets for web projects in some  situations.   Instead of saving semi-transparent PNGs, I’ll save fully opaque  versions  fig 3.17  that I can adjust in the browser. This not  only saves time, it also allows us to vary that opacity level on  :hover, :focus, and :active states without needing to create  multiple sets of images.  fig 3.17: The logo PNGs are   created fully-white.  Styling the list  The first bits of style will center the images in the footer, and  make them horizontal instead of vertical  fig 3.18 .      HOVER-CRAFTING WITH CSS3    47    footer-logos {    text-align: center;    }  footer-logos li {    display: inline;    }  fig 3.18: The white PNGs centered in the footer.  Next, let’s add the opacity values that will dim the icons in  their default state, brightening them up a bit when hovered or  focused.  footer-logos a img {    opacity: 0.25;    }    footer-logos a:hover img,  footer-logos a:focus img {    opacity: 0.6;    }  Here we’re showing the images at 25% opacity, then bringing  them up to 60% opacity when hovered or focused  fig 3.19 .  Quite a simple thing, isn’t it? And it requires only one set   of images.  Note that the opacity property doesn’t require vendor pre- fixes, and will work in Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Opera.  IE8 and below don’t support opacity, but there is a hack-ish  solution available for those who don’t mind treading into pro- priety waters.     48   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   fig 3.19: Showing the :hover state of the icons in the footer by adjusting the opacity.  The IE opacity hack Thankfully, opacity is now supported in Internet Explorer 9  Beta, but we can also mimic the same result for older versions  of IE by using the proprietary Microsoft filter property.   Normally I wouldn’t suggest using filter, as  unlike vendor- prefixed properties  it’s not part of any proposed standard.  Also, use of the filter property can bring increased perfor- mance overhead depending on where or how often it’s used.  It’s a hack—but it provides a means to an end.   So long as you understand this, and perhaps quarantine the  use of this property to its own stylesheet or else carefully  comment it, then it can be a viable method.  Here’s how it works:  footer-logos a img {    border: none;    opacity: 0.25;    -ms-filter: "progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft. »      Alpha Opacity=25 ";  * IE 8 hack *     filter: alpha opacity = 25 ;  * IE 5-7 hack *     }  footer-logos a:hover img,  footer-logos a:focus img {    opacity: 0.6;       HOVER-CRAFTING WITH CSS3    49      -ms-filter:"progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft. »      Alpha Opacity=60 ";  * IE 8 hack *     filter: alpha opacity = 60 ;  * IE 5-7 hack *     }  The syntax is similar, with a value of opacity passed through  IE’s alpha filter. Note that IE8 ignores the filter property  and requires the vendor-prefixed –ms-filter with some ad- ditional  ugly  values.  With the hacks in place, you’ll now see the same results in  Internet Explorer  fig 3.20 . Again, use this sparingly, if at all.  But the reality is that you’ll likely need to use it should any of  your sites have sizable IE traffic stats  and most sites do .  fig 3.20: The footer in IE7, with the filter hack in place, mimicking the opacity property.  Adding a transition Lastly, adding a transition to the opacity swap will smooth  out that value change, and provide a bit of animated richness  that’ll tie this whole technique together.  Let’s add our  now familiar  transition stack to the declara- tion, this time transitioning the opacity property specifically.  We’ll make it rather quick  just 0.2 seconds  and ease it in and  then out again.  footer-logos a img {    opacity: 0.25;      50   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS     -ms-filter: "progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft. »      Alpha Opacity=25 ";  * IE 8 hack *     filter: alpha opacity = 25 ;  * IE 5-7 hack *     -webkit-transition: opacity 0.2s ease-in-out;    -moz-transition: opacity 0.2s ease-in-out;    -o-transition: opacity 0.2s ease-in-out;    transition: opacity 0.2s ease-in-out;    }  footer-logos a:hover img,  footer-logos a:focus img {    opacity: 0.6;    -ms-filter: "progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft. »      Alpha Opacity=60 ";  * IE 8 hack *     filter: alpha opacity = 60 ;  * IE 5-7 hack *     }  With the transition in place, we now have a simple technique  for using opacity to craft a flexible hover experience using a  single set of images.   GO FORTH AND HOVER-CRAFT As I mentioned before, this solution has affected the way I  think about creating the asset graphics for a design. We can  use opacity to control how the graphic appears by default,  blending it into the background—then applying a different  value for :hover, :focus, and :active states, tying it together  with a transition for browsers that support it.  Keep the opacity property in mind next time you’re creating  hover treatments for hyperlinked images in your own designs.  You’ll save time, bandwidth, and the unnecessary complexity  that other solutions might require.      HOVER-CRAFTING WITH CSS3    51    Hover-crafting with CSS3 is about quickly and efficiently add- ing simple styles that enrich the experience layer, surprising  and delighting users with the browsers that support those  properties now and into the future. If the browser doesn’t  support the high-fidelity experience you’ve created, that’s per- fectly OK, as they won’t know what they’re missing.     52   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   4 TRANSFORMING  THE MESSAGE  Like css transitions, CSS transforms were also initially  developed by the WebKit team, then folded back into two  separate Working Drafts at the W3C:  1.  CSS 2D Transforms  http:  www.w3.org TR CSS3-2d-transforms   2. CSS 3D Transforms  http:  www.w3.org TR CSS3-3d-transforms    We’re going to focus solely on 2D transforms in this book, as  they’re the most practical to use right now. An entire book  could be filled with information on 3D transforms alone, and  they’re wonderfully magical. But 2D transforms have the most  traction in regards to browser support, including Safari 3.2,  Chrome 3.2, Firefox 4.0, and Opera 10.5  just like transitions .  So just what are CSS Transforms? The W3C describes   them as:      TRANSFORMING THE MESSAGE    53    CSS 2D Transforms allow elements rendered by CSS to be trans- formed in two-dimensional space.1  Well, that was helpful. The best way to understand transforms  is to see them in action.   So let’s first walk through a simple example applying various  2D transforms on a small photo gallery. We’ll then use those  same techniques in practice on the moon example site later in  the chapter.  THE SCALE TRANSFORM Consider a horizontal list of three, subtly framed photos from  a recent trip to Martha’s Vineyard, a small island off the coast  of Massachusetts  fig 4.01 . This is a rather typical design pat- tern: a grid of linked images.  fig 4.01: A grid of three hyperlinked photos.  We’re going to rely once again on our trusty unordered list to  mark these up:                        1. http:  www.w3.org TR CSS3-2d-transforms abstract     54   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS               With no style yet applied, Figure 4.02 shows how this list  would appear by default. Notice how the images are quite a  bit larger than we’d like them to be in the final design. This is  intentional, as we’ll be using CSS to scale them down.  fig 4.02: The list of large photos,   before CSS is applied.  Adding style Let’s add some CSS to make this vertical list of photos a hori- zontal grid, with a one pixel border around each image  also  note the page background is a light gray eee .  ul.gallery li {    float: left;    margin: 0 10px;    padding: 10px;       TRANSFORMING THE MESSAGE    55      border: 1px solid ddd;    list-style: none;    }  ul.gallery li a img {    float: left;    width: 200px;    }  Here we’ve floated the list items, turned list-style bullets  off, and wrapped each li in a one pixel gray border. We’ve  also floated the images themselves and sized them down to  200 pixels wide.   Those two compact declarations will get us where we want to  go in terms of a default design  refer back to fig 4.01 .  Applying the scale transform on hover Now it’s time for transforms. Let’s add a scale transform to  make the photo larger when hovered. Remember that the  original images in the markup are larger than the 200 pixel  width we’re specifying in the stylesheet. That means we can  safely scale up the photo while maintaining its quality.  Scale transforms are supported in Safari, Chrome, Firefox,  and Opera—each requiring a vendor prefix. Let’s add a stack  that satisfies those browsers as well as any future ones.  ul.gallery li a:hover img {    -webkit-transform: scale 1.5 ;    -moz-transform: scale 1.5 ;    -o-transform: scale 1.5 ;    transform: scale 1.5 ;    }  When the hyperlinks are hovered, we’re saying, “scale the  images to 1.5 times their initial size”  which was 200px wide .      56   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   Setting scale 2  would make the photo twice as large,  scale 0.5  would make it half as large, etc.  Figure 4.03 shows the result, viewed here in Safari. Notice  how the transform doesn’t disturb the rest of the elements  in the document, and zooms the photo out from the center,  without affecting the layout around it.  fig 4.03: The middle photo being hovered and scaled with a CSS transform.  You can also optionally set a transform-origin that will dic- tate where the scaling will expand from: top, bottom, center,  or a percentage  see http:  bkaprt.com css3 8  .2  For example, to have the photo scale out from the bottom left  of its container instead of the center, you’d write this:  ul.gallery li a:hover img {    -webkit-transform-origin: bottom left;    -moz-transform-origin: bottom left;    -o-transform-origin: bottom left;    transform-origin: bottom left;    -webkit-transform: scale 1.5 ;    -moz-transform: scale 1.5 ;    -o-transform: scale 1.5 ;    transform: scale 1.5 ;    }  2. The long URL: http:  www.w3.org TR css3-2d-transforms transform-origin      TRANSFORMING THE MESSAGE    57    An appropriate drop shadow We could go a step further with this example and add a drop  shadow to the photo when hovered. This would be an appro- priate use of the CSS3 box-shadow property, as we’re making  the enlarged photo appear as if it’s pulling up off the page.  Now, the drop shadow is a delicate beast, an often overused  crutch by the trigger-happy designer. It’s easy to get carried  away and overdo it. But in this case, we’re attempting to add  dimension to the photo enlargement, so it should work out  quite well.  The syntax for box-shadow is identical to the text-shadow  property we used back in Chapter 3. However, unlike text- shadow, box-shadow requires vendor prefixes in order to work  in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox.  Opera 10+ and IE9 Beta sup- port the non-prefixed box-shadow.  Let’s fold those rules in.  ul.gallery li a:hover img {    -webkit-transform: scale 1.5 ;    -moz-transform: scale 1.5 ;    -o-transform: scale 1.5 ;    transform: scale 1.5 ;    -webkit-box-shadow: 4px 4px 10px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.5 ;    -moz-box-shadow: 4px 4px 10px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.5 ;    box-shadow: 4px 4px 10px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.5 ;    }  We’ve added a CSS3 stack for the box-shadow property for the  WebKit and Mozilla browsers that support it, ending with the  non-prefixed version as we have with other examples.   In terms of the syntax, here we’re applying a shadow on the  hovered image that is 4px from the top, 4px from the left, has  a 10px blur, and is black at 50% opacity  ensuring it’ll blend in  to whatever background or element sits behind it .     58   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   fig 4.04: The hovered photo, now scaled with box-shadow applied.  Figure 4.04 shows the shadow now appearing in conjunction  with the scale transform when a photo is hovered over. This  combination gives the effect of having the enlarged photo pop  out from the page.  Smoothing out the zoom with a transition Lastly, adding a transition to the linked photos will smooth  out the scaling, giving the :hover treatment an animated  zoom-in-and-out—an effect previously only possible with  Flash or JavaScript, but now possible in many browsers with  just the few lines of CSS3.  Here’s the transition stack added to the complete CSS for our  little photo gallery:  ul.gallery li {    float: left;    margin: 0 10px;    padding: 10px;    border: 1px solid ddd;    list-style: none;    }      TRANSFORMING THE MESSAGE    59    ul.gallery li a img {    float: left;    width: 200px;    -webkit-transition: -webkit-transform 0.2s ease-in-out;    -moz-transition: -moz-transform 0.2s ease-in-out;    transition: transform 0.2s ease-in-out;    }  ul.gallery li a:hover img {    -webkit-transform: scale 1.5 ;    -moz-transform: scale 1.5 ;    -o-transform: scale 1.5 ;    transform: scale 1.5 ;    -webkit-box-shadow: 4px 4px 10px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.5 ;    -moz-box-shadow: 4px 4px 10px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.5 ;    box-shadow: 4px 4px 10px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.5 ;     }   Notice this time, the property we’re transitioning is the scale  transform, hence the appropriate vendor prefixes are in place  for both the transition and transform properties.  TRANSFORMING THE EXPERIENCE With everything in place, the result is quite impressive for  the minimal amount of CSS that’s required to make it hap- pen. We’re putting most of the burden of the effect back on  the browsers that support it, rather than injecting Flash or  JavaScript to make it happen.  Again, the place where we chose to fully embrace CSS3 in this  particular example is in the experience layer: when the photo  is hovered, we’re offering an enhanced view. It’s not critical  for browsers that don’t support those properties.  Users of Internet Explorer, for example, will just see a gallery  of clickable thumbnails, and that’s perfectly OK. If the hover      60   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   treatment was critical, then we’d need to rethink our use of  CSS3 to achieve the visual experience.  ROTATE, SKEW, AND TRANSLATE In addition to scale, there are three other transforms avail- able for rotating, skewing, and translating elements.  Translate  moves elements via x y coordinates.  Let’s add each to the  photo gallery example to quickly see how they operate.  fig 4.05: A hovered photo, now scaled and rotated to the left using the rotate transform.  Adding rotation If we wanted to rotate the photo when hovered, while still  scaling it up, we can add the following rotate transform to  the :hover rule:  ul.gallery li a:hover img {    -webkit-transform: scale 1.5  rotate -10deg ;    -moz-transform: scale 1.5  rotate -10deg ;    -o-transform: scale 1.5  rotate -10deg ;    transform: scale 1.5  rotate -10deg ;    -webkit-box-shadow: 4px 4px 10px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.5 ;    -moz-box-shadow: 4px 4px 10px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.5 ;     box-shadow: 4px 4px 10px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.5 ;    }      TRANSFORMING THE MESSAGE    61    We’re still scaling up the photo on hover, but we’re also tip- ping the photo 10 degrees to the left using rotate  fig 4.05 .  This will work in Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. A nega- tive value from -1deg to -360deg rotates the element counter- clockwise, while a positive value from 1deg to 360deg rotates  it clockwise.  Alternatively, we could add varying rotate transforms to the  list items, so that the photo  and frame  appear to be tossed on  the table, randomly. Then we can rotate and scale on :hover  as well  fig 4.06 .  fig 4.06: Using rotate to make the photos appear scattered on the page.  I’m stressing in this little book that the most appropriate place  to add CSS3 is on the experience layer—but that doesn’t mean  you can’t use these techniques on the default view of a design,  provided again that they’re not critical and degrade well.      62   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   For example, should the browser not support rotate trans- forms, and the photos appear perfectly straight, that’d would  be fine. Nothing would appear broken.  No rotate? Don’t Panic A nice example of using rotate in the primary design of a  page is Panic Software’s blog  http:  www.panic.com blog ,  where they use very subtle rotation via CSS3 to tip the entries  to the left as if they’re sheets of paper left on a desk  fig 4.07 .  It’s not crucial to the design, and if the entries are straight  without rotation  fig 4.08 , it’s perfectly OK.  fig 4.07: Panic Software’s blog design  uses subtle rotation via CSS3 to add  realism.  fig 4.08: Without rotation, the blog  still looks great. Nothing appears   missing or broken.      TRANSFORMING THE MESSAGE    63    Rotating the sun Another nice example of an appropriate use of CSS transforms  is the site for Outside  http:  outsideapp.com , a wonderful  weather app for the iPhone  fig 4.09 .  fig 4.09: The Outside iPhone app uses rotation on the sun graphic.  At the top of the page is a sun graphic  fig 4.10  that ro- tates 360  via the use of the rotate transform.  In this case,  JavaScript is used to animate the rotation in non-WebKit  browsers, but we’ll be discussing pure CSS-based animations  later in Chapter 6 . This subtle experience enhancement is  simple and appropriate, as it mimics the same animated sun- shine that appears in the iPhone app itself. The sun doesn’t  rotate in browsers that don’t support CSS transforms, and  that’s perfectly fine. Nothing appears broken or missing in a  non-animated version of the site.     64   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   fig 4.10: Outside app’s sun graphic  comes to life after positioning and  rotating with CSS.  Transforms coupled with transitions in CSS can help support  the overall message in the designs we create for the web, and  that’s a wonderfully enabling tool for us web designers.  The skew transform The skew transform takes x and y coordinates and skews   an element. If we were to skew the photos in our gallery on  hover, for example, we’d use the following CSS  skewing neg- ative five degrees on the x coordinate, and 30 degrees on the y  coordinate   fig 4.11 :  ul.gallery li a:hover img {    -webkit-transform: scale 1.5  skew -5deg, 30deg ;    -moz-transform: scale 1.5  skew -5deg, 30deg ;    -o-transform: scale 1.5  skew -5deg, 30deg ;    transform: scale 1.5  skew -5deg, 30deg ;    }  fig 4.11: Using the skew transform to distort the photo.      TRANSFORMING THE MESSAGE    65    Like rotate, skew accepts positive and negative degree values.  You can also use just one value for both x and y like so  fig  4.12 :  ul.gallery li a:hover img {    -webkit-transform: scale 1.5  skew 30deg ;    -moz-transform: scale 1.5  skew 30deg ;    -o-transform: scale 1.5  skew 30deg ;    transform: scale 1.5  skew 30deg ;    }  fig 4.12: Skewing the photo 30 degrees on both the x and y axis.  Now I realize that what we just did to the photo is far from  visually compelling, and admittedly, I don’t use skew all that  often; however, I’m convinced there are interesting uses for it.   For example, skew could be used on blocks of text to create  three-dimensional visuals—all with semantic markup and  CSS3  figs 4.13 and 4.14 .   The translate transform Lastly, the translate transform allows you to move an ele- ment from its normal position on screen, using x and y  coordinates.     66   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   fig 4.13: A demo by Paul Hayes using skew and transitions to create multiple 3D cubes  from simple chunks of hypertext  http:  www.fofronline.com experiments cube multi- Cubes.html .  fig 4.14: The Web Trend Map uses skew to place avatars on an isometric grid, creating  unique data visualizations from otherwise flat elements  http:  webtrendmap.com .      TRANSFORMING THE MESSAGE    67    For example, if we wanted to move an image in the photo  gallery from its initial position upon hover, we could do that  with translate. And with our transition in place, that move- ment will be smoothly animated.  Here’s the syntax for moving the image 20 pixels to the right  and 40 pixels from the top of its original location  fig 4.15 :  ul.gallery li a:hover img {    -webkit-transform: scale 1.5  translate 20px, 40px ;    -moz-transform: scale 1.5  translate 20px, 40px ;    -o-transform: scale 1.5  translate 20px, 40px ;    transform: scale 1.5  translate 20px, 40px ;    }  fig 4.15: Using the translate transform to move the photo on :hover.  If we wanted to move the image to the left and or top, we’d  use negative values, e.g., translate -20px, -40px .  Like the aforementioned transforms, translate doesn’t dis- turb the other elements in the document, moving it explicitly  to wherever you tell it to go. That means you don’t have to be  concerned with margins, padding, clearing floats, or absolute  positioning. Give an element translate coordinates and it’ll  move it there.     68   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   DIFFERENT TRANSFORMS TO HELP   SUPPORT THE STORY The photo gallery example demonstrated how scale, rotate,  skew, and translate can work together with transitions to  create richer experiences. The key to using these transforms  well is to find appropriate situations in which they’ll assist in  telling the story of what’s on screen.   Again, it’s easy to get carried away with transforms, because,  well, they’re fun and simple to implement. But searching for  the appropriate places in the experience layer to enable them  will make for a better end product.  TRANSFORMING THE MOON Let’s return to the moon example site, where I’ve used various  transforms and transitions to help liven the experience on the  slideshow gallery  fig 4.16  .   fig 4.16: The slideshow carousel area of Things We Left on the Moon.  When hovering each of the items left on the moon, the image  reacts in a different way, depending on the nature of the item  being featured, be it a doughnut, a lawnmower, a cat, etc.      TRANSFORMING THE MESSAGE    69    Adding an appropriate transform transition to each of the  items is not only fun and easy to implement, it’s also harmless  for browsers that don’t yet support the bits of CSS3 that make  the interaction possible.  Let’s go through each item one by one to see how scale,   rotate, positioning, and opacity can be combined with tran- sitions to complete the experience.  Supporting the message If we think about each of the linked items, and specifically  about their meaning, we can then apply a transform and or  transition that supports the story of the object at hand.   How would a big doughnut or reclining chair react to interac- tion? We can choose to apply the appropriate CSS3 here to  help enrich the experience  fig 4.17 .  fig 4.17: The things we’ll be transforming.     70   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   The markup To mark up this faux carousel of wacky things, the semantics  are quite simple: just an ordered list of linked images, with a  heading underneath to describe what each item is.                        1 big doughnut                           1 lawnmower                           1 astro cat                           1 recliner                           1 magic gnome           Notice we’ve added an id of things to the list itself, and then  an id for each list item as well, so that we can add unique in- teractions to the :hover state of each item.  Base styles for each item Next we’ll add the base CSS for each list item that contains   the linked images. The following styles float the items to   make them horizontal, set relative positioning for the context  in which we will later absolutely position each image, and   finally, add a rounded, semi-transparent background frame.      TRANSFORMING THE MESSAGE    71    olthings li {    position: relative;    float: left;    margin: 0 15px 0 0;    padding: 10px;    background: 444;  * backup for non-RGBA *     background: rgba 255, 255, 255, 0.1 ;    list-style: none;    -webkit-border-radius: 4px;    -moz-border-radius: 4px;    -o-border-radius: 4px;     border-radius: 4px;    }  We’ll now set the moon background image that appears   behind each item, as well as giving each link a specific width  and height  fig 4.18 .  olthings li a {    float: left;    width: 137px;    height: 91px;    background: url .. img moon-137.jpg  »      no-repeat top left;    }  fig 4.18: The list items, now   with the moon background   image.     72   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   Catch-all declaration Our next step is to create a catch-all declaration that will ab- solutely position each image within the list item’s frame and  therefore on top of the moon background image.  We’ll be positioning each item slightly differently depend- ing on the object, as well as using varying transforms, but we  can declare position: absolute; here for all images so we  don’t have to duplicate that rule for each item. We’ll also add a  transition stack using the all value. That way, any transform  or change we wish to make on each thing will be transitioned  and smoothed out, regardless of which CSS properties we de- cide to change.  olthings li a img {    position: absolute;    -webkit-transition: all 0.2s ease-in;    -moz-transition: all 0.2s ease-in;    -o-transition: all 0.2s ease-in;    transition: all 0.2s ease-in;    }  Now we’re ready to add exact positioning and width for each  image, taking advantage of those ids we added to each list  item.   olthings lithings-1 a img {      width: 60px;    top: 23px;    left: 26px;    }  olthings lithings-2 a img {      width: 50px;    top: 20px;    left: 50px;    }      TRANSFORMING THE MESSAGE    73    olthings lithings-3 a img {      width: 80px;    top: 19px;    left: 30px;    }  olthings lithings-4 a img {      width: 70px;    top: 25px;    left: 45px;    }  olthings lithings-5 a img {      width: 80px;    top: 20px;    left: 34px;    }  I’ve created these images on the large side, so that if we wish  to scale them up, we can do so without stretching the image  beyond its native dimensions.  Now we’ll add a unique :hover treatment to each item, know- ing that the catch-all transition will smooth out and animate  whatever we fold in.  Scaling the big doughnut The big doughnut gets bigger on hover, so we’ll use the scale  transform here to scale up the image. Remember that the  original image in the markup is quite a bit bigger than what  we sized down to in the stylesheet. This was intentional, so  we could scale it up like this.  olthings lithings-1 a:hover img {    -webkit-transform: scale 1.25 ;    -moz-transform: scale 1.25 ;      74   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS     -o-transform: scale 1.25 ;    transform: scale 1.25 ;    }  These rules will scale the doughnut up by 25% on hover.  Figure 4.19 shows the normal and hover states, with the  doughnut getting a little bigger when moused over.  fig 4.19: The big doughnut gets bigger on :hover using scale.  Perspective with scale and position For the lawnmower left on the moon, we’ll do two things:  1.  Scale it larger with a transform. 2. Move it down and to the right.  These two changes plus the transition make the mower ap- pear like it’s coming at you  lookout! . It’s very subtle, but  simple and effective.  We’ll adjust the default position five pixels lower and 10 pixels  to the right. And we’ll also add a transform stack to scale the  mower 20% larger than the default.      TRANSFORMING THE MESSAGE    75    olthings lithings-2 a:hover img {    top: 25px;    left: 60px;    -webkit-transform: scale 1.2 ;    -moz-transform: scale 1.2 ;    -o-transform: scale 1.2 ;    transform: scale 1.2 ;    }  fig 4.20: The lawnmower uses position and scale to create a pseudo three-  dimensional effect.  Figure 4.20 shows the default and hovered state, and the illu- sion of a mower coming at you is complete.  The elusive astro cat We can add CSS transitions on a whole host of properties  not  just CSS3 ones ; simply smoothing out a position change can  make the astro cat appear as though it’s avoiding the mouse.   By adjusting the left position of the image on hover, the  catch-all transition will smooth that movement out, making  the astro cat appear like it’s sliding back and forth.     76   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   Here we’ll move the cat 15 pixels to the right by upping the  left value from 30px to 45px  fig 4.21 :  olthings lithings-3 a:hover img {    left: 45px;    }  Pretty simple. And it’s really the CSS transition that’s doing  the magic here.  fig 4.21: The cat slides back and forth, as cats often do.  Tipping back the recliner A good recliner tips back, and we can mimic that real-world  reaction with the aforementioned rotate transform.  Let’s add the transform stack to rotate the recliner slightly,  to the left. We’ll use the vendor-prefixed rules for WebKit,  Mozilla, and Opera-based browsers, as well as ending with  the actual transform property for future implementations.  olthings lithings-4 a:hover img {    -webkit-transform: rotate -15deg ;    -moz-transform: rotate -15deg ;       TRANSFORMING THE MESSAGE    77      -o-transform: rotate -15deg ;    transform: rotate -15deg ;    }  We used a negative value to tip the image to the left  counter- clockwise , and once again the transition will smooth out that  subtle rotation, completing the illusion of our comfy, plushy  chair on the moon  fig 4.22 .  fig 4.22: The recliner tips back to the left using a negative value on the rotate transform.  The disappearing gnome For the final item, we’ll take a lounging gnome and make him  partially disappear. Somehow, that seems like a perfectly natu- ral thing for a gnome to do.  We’ll use the opacity property to simply and quickly create  a hover style for the image, dimming it down considerably.  Because of the transition already in place for all property  changes on the image, the opacity swap will animate in  browsers that support transitions, creating a smooth disap- pearance for our little friend.  The declaration is simply:     78   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   olthings lithings-5 a:hover img {    opacity: 0.4;    }  Figure 4.23 shows how the gnome fades out to 40% opacity  on :hover.   fig 4.23: The gnome almost disappears by reducing opacity on :hover.  Now, remember, if we wanted this effect to work  sans transi- tions  in Internet Explorer, we could revisit the proprietary  filter property hack explained in Chapter 3.  Harmless degradation Like the photo gallery example we discussed earlier in the  chapter, the sprinkling of CSS3 we’re adding here is harmless  for browsers that don’t yet support it.   In the end, the important thing here is that each of these items  is a clickable link. What happens beyond that is an enriched  experience for those that are capable of receiving it.      TRANSFORMING THE MESSAGE    79    ONE MORE TIME NOW: BE SMART, BE SUBTLE By taking a little time to think about the meaning behind the  content we’re dealing with, we can choose to apply some of  the CSS3 properties that work today along with transitions  and transforms.   These experience enhancements can be the mark of a true  web craftsperson: attention to details that not everyone will  notice, care and feeding for non-critical visual events, and  elevating the message a step beyond the norm. For browsers  that support this stuff now, and those that will in the future,  the small amount of code and thought is well worth it.  Try and be subtle when it comes to CSS transforms. It’s easy  to get carried away, but when used appropriately, they can  make all the difference in the way the reader experiences the  message you’re delivering.  More “wow,” please Speaking of getting carried away, the next time your client  or boss says, “this design needs more ‘wow’” or “it’s miss- ing some pizzazz!” just add the following declaration to your  stylesheet  and make sure they’re using Safari, Chrome,  Firefox, or Opera, of course :  *:hover {    -webkit-transform: rotate 180deg ;    -moz-transform: rotate 180deg ;    -o-transform: rotate 180deg ;    transform: rotate 180deg ;    }  This little bit of CSS3 says, “hover over anything on the page,  and rotate it 180 degrees.” Try it. It’s a sure-fire way to make a  big impression  fig 4.24 .     80   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   fig 4.24: The chaos that results from the “rotate everything on hover” trick.  Actually, the sad thing is that there are some clients and bosses that  might love this.   “This is great! Ship it!”  Sigh.       TRANSFORMING THE MESSAGE    81    5 MULTIPLE   BACKGROUNDS  if you asked me two years ago, “What’s the one thing  you’re looking most forward to in CSS3?” I might’ve enthusi- astically replied, “Multiple background images!” At the time,  the ability to layer more than one background image on a  single element seemed as though it would cure a lot of the  headaches we’d been suffering as web designers.   To create flexible, bulletproof solutions to design problems,  we must figure out how we can get by using fewer graphics or  without adding extraneous markup as hooks for extra back- ground images. We’ve done the best with what we’ve had, but  the promise of being able to assign multiple background im- ages to an element had always seemed, to me, to be this won- derful promise of easier times with less code.  The reality, though, is that along the way, browsers have add- ed support for much of the Backgrounds and Borders Module      82   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   in CSS3  http:  bkaprt.com css3 9  .1 Many of the properties  we’ve discussed previously in the book have decent browser  support today in Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and IE9   Beta. And properties like border-radius, box-shadow, gra- dients, RGBA, and opacity make it possible in some cases to  solve common problems without images at all. Many of the  techniques that previously required images are possible en- tirely within the stylesheets themselves. All of that has obvi- ous benefits.  So while a few years ago, I was salivating over the prospect of  multiple background support, today, I’m less excited because  of all the other tools we have at our disposal. That said, there  are wonderful use cases for assigning multiple background im- ages on a single element, and we’re going to talk about one  particular technique in this brief chapter.  PARALLAX SCROLLING If we take a look back at the moon example site, I’ve used  multiple background images on the body element to create a  layered space environment. Instead of one flat image, there  are four semi-transparent PNGs stacked on top of each other.  Each has it’s own horizontal positioning to create an animated  effect when the browser window is resized  fig 5.01 .   fig 5.01: The background of  the moon example site, where  four PNGs are stacked to   create a sense of deep space.  1. The long URL: http:  www.w3.org TR CSS3-background       MULTIPLE BACKGROUNDS    83    This technique of speed-shifting layers has been dubbed   “parallax scrolling” which our friends at Wikipedia define as:  A special scrolling technique in computer graphics, seen first in  the 1982 arcade game Moon Patrol. In this pseudo-3D technique,  background images move by the “camera” slower than foreground  images, creating an illusion of depth in a 2D video game and add- ing to the immersion. The technique grew out of the multiplane  camera technique used in traditional animation since the 1940s.2  Many great examples of applying the parallax effect on   the web have been popping up over the last few years, and   a longtime favorite of mine is the site for Silverback  http:   silverbackapp.com , a handy piece of usability testing software  from the folks at Clearleft  fig 5.02 .  Resize the browser window back and forth and notice how  the layers of vines hanging down from the top shift back and   fig 5.02: Resize the browser window while visiting Silverback and enjoy the three-  dimensional jungle experience.  2. http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Parallax_scrolling     84   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   forth at slightly different speeds, creating a sense of dimension   I did that for probably an hour straight when I first encoun- tered the site .   Sure, not everyone is going to see it—but for those that do ex- perience it, it’s a wonderful detail and enhanced user experi- ence that can’t help but make you just a tiny bit happier.  THE OLD WAY: EXTRA MARKUP So how is it done? Paul Annett wrote up the techniques he  used to create the parallax effect specifically for the Silverback  site in an article for Think Vitamin back in early 2008  http:   bkaprt.com css3 10  .3  To layer the three layers of vines, each a separate PNG, you  must have at least three available block-level elements.  Two  extra wrapper divs are necessary to place a background image  on the body, midground, and foreground elements.  I’m loosely translating here, for simplicity, but the markup  would be something like:                                          The CSS to place the three images, each with varying horizon- tal positions, would be something like:   3. The long URL: http:  thinkvitamin.com design how-to-recreate-silverbacks- parallax-effect       MULTIPLE BACKGROUNDS    85    body {    background: url vines-back.png  repeat-x 20% 0;    }  midground {    background: url vines-mid.png  repeat-x 40% 0;    }  foreground {    background: url vines-front.png  repeat-x 150% 0;    }     Now this works perfectly well. But it’s made far simpler when  using the multiple backgrounds syntax introduced in CSS3.  Let’s take a look at how multiple backgrounds are applied to  the body of the moon example site, and how that creates a  simpler parallax effect for those that might experience it.  THE NEW WAY: MULTIPLE BACKGROUNDS   VIA CSS3 I’m using four semi-transparent PNGs to create the deep space  background used on the moon example site. They’re all lay- ered on the body element, stacked one on top of each other to  create that sense of dimension when the browser’s window is  resized by the user.  Figure 5.03 shows each of the four PNG images used:  1.  Dust clouds  clouds.png  2. Blue to purple gradient  space-bg.png  3. Layer of stars  stars-1.png  4. Another layer of randomly-placed stars  stars-2.png      86   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   fig 5.03: The four semi-transparent background PNGs that are layered underneath the  moon example site.  Multiple backgrounds syntax And here’s how simple it is to assign these four images as  backgrounds of the body element, using the updated CSS3  syntax:  body {    background:       url .. img stars-1.png  repeat-x fixed -130% 0,      url .. img stars-2.png  repeat-x fixed 40% 0,      url .. img space-bg.png  repeat-x fixed -80% 0,      url .. img clouds.png  repeat-x fixed 100% 0;    background-color: 1a1a1a;    }      MULTIPLE BACKGROUNDS    87    Here I’m layering the four images, with the clouds at the bot- tom, and stars on top in a comma-delimited list  notice the  stacking order starts with the image “closest” to the user . I’m  also repeating each of these horizontally, and setting them   at differing horizontal positions  using positive and negative  values  to make each layer “shift” at different speeds as the  window is resized. And finally, I’ve fixed them in a locked   position on the page with the fixed value.  The almost-black background color of 1a1a1a is added in last  as a separate background-color rule.  fig 5.04: The four PNGs layered on top of each other as well as a dark charcoal   background color.  And that’s it  fig 5.04 . What’s wonderful about this is that  there is no extraneous markup necessary. We’re putting all  of these images on the body element so that they’ll sit behind  the page’s content, but we didn’t need to add dummy wrapper  divs to layer them.     88   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   What about browser support? As mentioned back in Chapter 1, multiple backgrounds are  supported in Safari 1.3+, Chrome 2+, Firefox 3.6+, Opera 10.5+,  and IE9 Beta. So, really, they’re on par with many of the other  CSS properties we’ve been using throughout the book.   Once again, we’ve chosen to utilize this wonderful CSS3 gem  in a non-critical part of the design because of that imperfect  support: enriching the background of the page, heightening the  experience of resizing the window by creating a parallax effect  for those that are able to experience it.  Providing a fallback for all browsers Browsers that don’t yet support multiple backgrounds will  ignore the entire background rule. And that’s precisely why  we’ve defined the background-color in a separate rule.  Figure 5.05 shows the moon example site as viewed in IE7,  where the multiple background images we’ve declared are   ignored, showing only the charcoal background-color.   fig 5.05: IE7 ignores the rule where multiple background images are declared, showing  only the dark charcoal background color.      MULTIPLE BACKGROUNDS    89    Now, nothing is broken here—but losing all the space-y-ness in  the background is a shame. The solution is to specify a single  fallback background image first in the declaration, for brows- ers  like IE7 and 8  that don’t support multiple images. Then  we can override that rule with the multiple one  which will be  ignored by IE .  body {    background: url .. img space-bg.png  »      repeat-x fixed -80% 0;    background:       url .. img stars-1.png  repeat-x fixed -130% 0,      url .. img stars-2.png  repeat-x fixed 40% 0,      url .. img space-bg.png  repeat-x fixed -80% 0,      url .. img clouds.png  repeat-x fixed 100% 0;    background-color: 1a1a1a;    }  For the single image fallback, you could choose one of the im- ages used in the multiple declaration, or even go so far as to  create a flattened version of the multiple layers.   For the moon site, I’ve chosen to simply use space-bg.png,  which is the color gradient image  fig 5.06 , therefore serv- ing a starless, cloudless version of the background to brows- ers that don’t yet support multiple background images. How  appropriate.  USING MULTIPLE BACKGROUNDS TODAY In keeping with the theme of the other examples in the book,  here we’re using multiple background images today. We’re  forging ahead with a CSS3 property that has healthy support  in Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Opera, as well as IE9 Beta.  Instead of fearing that non-universal support and waiting it  out, we’re choosing to apply the property on a non-critical  visual event  a parallax-shifting background .      90   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   fig 5.06: With the single fallback image in place, IE7 now has a bit more   space-y-ness restored.  We also know that if the browser doesn’t support multiple  backgrounds, it will ignore the entire background rule. To  compensate, we’ll define a flat or alternate single graphic in a  background rule that comes before the multiple one.   And with all of that in mind, we can now more flexibly exper- iment with layering, shifting, and positioning background im- ages on top of each other, without the need for extra markup.  It’ll be exciting to see how this technique is used in creative  new ways.      MULTIPLE BACKGROUNDS    91    6ENRICHING   FORMS  forms are another aspect of a website that can involve  interaction, and therefore they offer additional visual events  that are ripe for enriching with CSS3.  By default, form elements themselves can differ drastically in  appearance depending on the browser or operating system  in which they’re viewed. Why not embrace that variation by  choosing to apply the portions of CSS3 that work today to  heighten the experience?  It’s important to strike a balance between subtle modification  of form elements and maintaining the familiar to ensure us- ability for your forms. In other words, an input should still  obviously appear as an input. Now that CSS is capable of  deep styling of form elements  in most browsers , we have to  be careful to not tamper with the most important part: the  functionality.     92   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   That said, there’s a lot we can do with forms in regards to  CSS3 to enrich the experience for browsers that support it  now, while degrading that experience gracefully for browsers  that don’t.  This chapter also gives us an excuse to talk about three por- tions of CSS3 that we haven’t yet touched on:  1.  Powerful new selectors  2. CSS Gradients 3. CSS Animations   Again, we’ll use the moon example site as a launching pad to  talk about how forms and CSS3 can work together in new  and creative ways. Specifically, the “New Thing Alerts” sign- up form that sits in the right sidebar  fig 6.01 .  fig 6.01: A simple form where users  can subscribe to updates as new items  are left on the moon.  MARKING UP THE SIMPLE SIGN-UP FORM In terms of HTML, this little form is about as simple as it gets.  Just a few inputs with labels and a submit button.      ENRICHING FORMS    93                 Your Name                         Your Email                                   Figure 6.02 shows the form with the default browser styles  as  viewed in Safari .  fig 6.02: The form viewed in Safari,  sans styles.  ADDING STYLES FOR FIELDSET AND LABEL The first bits of CSS we’ll add to start sculpting this form are  for the fieldset and label elements—just a bit of spacing  between each row.   thing-alerts fieldset {    margin: 0 0 10px 0;    }     94   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   thing-alerts label {    display: block;    font-weight: bold;    line-height: 1.4;    color: 666;    color: rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.6 ;    text-shadow: 0 1px 1px fff;    }  Looking at Figure 6.03 you’ll notice we’ve added a 10px  margin below each fieldset row, and we’ve set labels to  display: block to put them on their own line. We’ve also  assigned black at 60% transparency for the text, as well as a  backup color of solid gray for browsers that don’t yet support  RGBA. And we’ve applied a subtle white highlight with text- shadow, to make the text appear as though it’s inset on the  background.  fig 6.03: The fieldset and label   elements are now styled.  Now while we have nice 10 pixel spacing between fieldset  rows, because of the padding inside the gray box, we don’t  need the 10 pixel margin under the last row  containing the  submit button .  This is a common pattern: you have a list or succession of  elements, each with the same styles applied, but you’d like to  style the last element in that succession a little differently.      ENRICHING FORMS    95    Instead of adding class="last" to the final element, why  not take advantage of the :last-child pseudo-class in CSS3  to remove the bottom margin without having to touch the  markup:  thing-alerts fieldset {    margin: 0 0 10px 0;    }  thing-alerts fieldset label {    display: block;    font-weight: bold;    line-height: 1.4;    color: 666;    color: rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.6 ;    text-shadow: 0 1px 1px fff;    }  thing-alerts fieldset:last-child {    margin: 0;    }  Keep in mind that :last-child isn’t supported in IE8 and  below, but for minor presentational adjustments like this one,  it’s a great alternative to adding a class in the markup.  Figure 6.04 shows where we’re at currently, now with bottom  margin on the last fieldset element removed by way of the  :last-child pseudo-class.  More CSS3 selectors While we’re making good use of :last-child, it’s a good time  to point out that there are many more wonderfully conve- nient new selectors in CSS3.      96   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   fig 6.04: With the bottom margin  removed from the final fieldset,   our form spacing is looking good.  I highly recommend Roger Johansson’s article on the subject,  “CSS3 selectors explained”  http:  bkaprt.com css3 11  1 where  he demonstrates what they are and how they work. Support  for CSS3 selectors varies across browsers, so be sure to refer- ence Peter-Paul Koch’s thorough “CSS contents and browser  compatibility” tables  http:  bkaprt.com css3 12  2 and “CSS  Compatibility and Internet Explorer” from Microsoft  http:   bkaprt.com css3 13  3 to see who supports what.   STYLING THE TEXT INPUTS Next, let’s start adding the styles that turn default text inputs  into something a bit more customized. This time we’ll use a  CSS2.1 attribute selector to target the input type="text" ele- ments only  and not the input type="submit" button .  1. The long URL: http:  www.456bereastreet.com archive 200601 css_3_ selectors_explained  2. The long URL: http:  www.quirksmode.org css contents.html 3. The long URL: http:  msdn.microsoft.com en-us library   cc351024 VS.85 .aspx      ENRICHING FORMS    97    If we simply declared:  thing-alerts input  we’d be styling all inputs in the form  text and buttons , but if  we modify that to:   thing-alerts input[type="text"]   we’ll target the text inputs only.  Again, using a powerful selector in the stylesheet avoids hav- ing to add extra classes in the markup to style the various form  elements separately. This is beautiful.  Keep in mind that while attribute selectors are supported in  IE7 and above, they aren’t supported in IE6, but that’s OK  since we’re just modifying the non-critical appearance of these  form elements. IE6 will ignore these rules, and that’s perfectly  acceptable in this case.   The following declaration applies a specific width, padding,  and font-size, turns off default borders, adds a background- color, and rounds the corners of the inputs using our trusty  border-radius stack.  thing-alerts fieldset input[type="text"] {    width: 215px;    padding: 5px 8px;    font-size: 1.2em;    color: 666;    border: none;    background-color: fff;    -webkit-border-radius: 4px;    -moz-border-radius: 4px;    -o-border-radius: 4px;    border-radius: 4px;    }     98   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   fig 6.05: Flat, rounded text inputs.  Figure 6.05 shows our progress viewed in Safari  with similar  results in Firefox and Opera . We now have flat, rounded text  inputs which look quite nice, but let’s add some depth to make  them look more like a typical, editable input.  USING CSS3 GRADIENTS One crafty way we can add some of that depth is by way of  CSS gradients, which are new in CSS3. That is, create a gradi- ent from one color to another without the use of any images.  That sounds pretty enticing, doesn’t it?  CSS gradients are currently supported in Safari 4+, Chrome  2+, and Firefox 3.6+ only, but again, for non-critical uses, it  can be a flexible solution that degrades well.  CSS gradients can be assigned anywhere that an image can be  declared in the stylesheet. In other words, background-image,  list-style-image, border-image, and generated content.  The syntax for declaring CSS gradients differs slightly be- tween Safari’s implementation and Firefox. The  very prelimi- nary  spec, however, leans more toward the way Firefox han- dles things. Here’s a prime example of why vendor prefixing is  an important part of the process: these two varying syntaxes       ENRICHING FORMS    99    can be correctly declared for each browser, while the official  spec is still being hashed out.  I’ll be honest in saying that the syntax for either can be a tad  bit confusing. There’s an immense amount of control pos- sible in creating gradients, including the colors involved, color  stops, direction of the gradient, etc.   For example, here is the syntax for creating a simple linear  gradient for both WebKit and Mozilla-based browsers on the  background of an element:  foo {    background-image: -webkit-gradient linear, »      0% 0%, 0% 100%, from fff , to 999  ;    background-image: -moz-linear-gradient 0% 100% »      90deg, fff, 999 ;    }  It’s not entirely intuitive, and it’s also difficult to remember  the differences for each vendor.  The best way I’ve found to come up with the right code is  to use John Allsopp’s wonderful WYSIWYG editor  fig 6.06,   http:  bkaprt.com css3 14  .4  Use this tool to visually create the gradients you want, then  grab the appropriate syntax for both Safari and Firefox. John’s  tool does all the heavy lifting for you. And this is extremely  helpful as I haven’t been able to memorize the code  and the  differences between browsers  yet.

After fiddling  and entering some values into John Allsopp’s tool, we come  up with two short lines of CSS:  thing-alerts fieldset input[type="text"] {    width: 215px;    padding: 5px 8px;    font-size: 1.2em;    color: 666;    border: none;    background-image: -webkit-gradient linear, »      0% 0%, 0% 12%, from 999 , to fff  ;    background-image: -moz-linear-gradient 0% 12% »      90deg, fff, 999 ;    background-color: fff;    -webkit-border-radius: 4px;    -moz-border-radius: 4px;    -o-border-radius: 4px;    border-radius: 4px;    }      ENRICHING FORMS    101    fig 6.07: A zoomed view of the tiny gradient  at the top of each text input that makes it look  recessed.  We’re applying a linear gradient here, but radial gradients are  also possible with CSS.  And here you can see how the syntax differs between –webkit  and –moz implementations. We’re essentially adding a small  linear gradient that goes from light gray  999  to white  fff   for just 12% of the vertical height of the input. We’re apply- ing the vendor-prefixed background-image rules to make that  happen in Safari and Firefox.   Figure 6.08 shows the results, where you can see our rounded  inputs now sporting a little inner shadow using no images.   fig 6.08: Text inputs with the   CSS gradient in place.  Browsers that don’t yet support CSS gradients will ignore  those background-image rules and just be flat white. And  that’s perfectly fine. But the adjustment, flexibility, and con- trol that comes along with CSS gradients is rather compelling.      102   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   We’ll be using them a bit more in the next section regarding  the submit button.  A PURE CSS3 BUTTON If there’s one UI element that can demonstrate how trans- formative CSS3 can be, it just may be the button. Combining  many of the techniques we’ve already discussed throughout  the book, we’ll turn an ordinary form submit button into  something far more interesting—entirely with CSS  fig 6.09 .  fig 6.09: The default submit   button in Safari on the left vs.  one styled with CSS3—no   images!—on the right.  The beauty of applying CSS3 to style the button is that by   not using images, we’re left with something far more flexible.  If the browser doesn’t support the properties we’ll use to   elevate this button visually, that’s OK. It’ll degrade nicely to   a default form button in whatever browser the user happens  to be using.  So let’s walk through the steps needed to take a default   form button to the wonderfully shiny one on the right in  Figure 6.09.  Base button styles First, we’ll add some padding, change the font to Helvetica  to match the rest of the design, turn off borders, and set the  background color to white.  thing-alerts input[type="submit"] {    padding: 8px 15px;    font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;       ENRICHING FORMS    103      font-weight: bold;    line-height: 1;    color: 444;    border: none;    background-color: fff;    }  Figure 6.10 shows how things are looking in Safari with those  simple base styles applied. And we already have something  that looks nothing like a default input button.  fig 6.10: A submit button with default borders  and backgrounds removed.  Rounding to a pill shape Next, let’s add a border-radius stack to get the button round- ed down to a pill shape  fig 6.11 .  thing-alerts fieldset input[type="submit"] {    padding: 8px 15px;    font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;    font-weight: bold;    line-height: 1;    color: 444;    border: none;    background-color: fff;    -webkit-border-radius: 23px;    -moz-border-radius: 23px;    -o-border-radius: 23px;    border-radius: 23px;    }     104   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   fig 6.11: Rounding the submit button using  border-radius.  After a bit of experimenting with the right value, we’ve settled  on 23px to get the pill shape.   Appling a linear gradient Now let’s apply a gradient of light gray  bbb  from bottom  up to white  fff  at the top of the button. We’ll again rely  on Mr. Allsopp’s gradient tool to spit out the correct rules for  Safari, Chrome, and Firefox.  thing-alerts input[type="submit"] {    padding: 8px 15px;    font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;    font-weight: bold;    line-height: 1;    color: 444;    border: none;    background-image: -webkit-gradient linear, »      0% 0%, 0% 100%, from fff , to bbb  ;    background-image: -moz-linear-gradient 0 100% »      90deg, fff, bbb ;     background-color: fff;    -webkit-border-radius: 23px;    -moz-border-radius: 23px;    -o-border-radius: 23px;    border-radius: 23px;    }      ENRICHING FORMS    105    fig 6.12: The CSS gradient added to the submit button.  Figure 6.12 shows the progress as viewed in Safari. Now we  have a rounded button with a CSS gradient applied. So far, no  images have been used and we’ve only added a few lines in  our stylesheet.  Adding text-shadow to let the type sink in Let’s now add an almost-white text-shadow below the text  that will make it look as if the text is stamped into the button.  thing-alerts input[type="submit"] {    padding: 8px 15px;    font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;    font-weight: bold;    line-height: 1;    color: 444;    border: none;    text-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba 255, 255, 255, 0.85 ;    background-image: -webkit-gradient linear, »      0% 0%, 0% 100%, from fff , to bbb  ;    background-image: -moz-linear-gradient 0 100% »      90deg, fff, bbb ;     background-color: fff;    -webkit-border-radius: 23px;    -moz-border-radius: 23px;    -o-border-radius: 23px;    border-radius: 23px;    }     We’ll use RGBA to tone down pure white to 85%, letting  the gray gradient show through just a tiny bit. We’re also      106   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   specifying that the shadow sits directly under the text by one  pixel, and blurring the shadow one pixel as well.  Figure 6.13 shows a close-up of the subtle shadow in place, as  well as how the button is coming along so far.  fig 6.13: A zoomed-in view of  the subtle text-shadow we add- ed to create an embossed look.  Adding a box-shadow to the button Our last piece of CSS3 to add to this stylish little button is a  very slight box-shadow to add just another hint of dimension.  It’ll help it sit better on the gray background behind it.  Here’s a stack that adds the box-shadow to the browsers that  currently support it, as well as future ones.  thing-alerts input[type="submit"] {    padding: 8px 15px;    font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;    font-weight: bold;    line-height: 1;    color: 444;    border: none;    text-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba 255, 255, 255, 0.85 ;    background-image: -webkit-gradient linear, »      0% 0%, 0% 100%, from fff , to bbb  ;    background-image: -moz-linear-gradient 0% 100% »      90deg, bbb, fff ;    background-color: fff;       ENRICHING FORMS    107      -webkit-border-radius: 23px;    -moz-border-radius: 23px;    -o-border-radius: 23px;    border-radius: 23px;    -webkit-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.5 ;    -moz-box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.5 ;    box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.5 ;    }   fig 6.14: A zoomed-in view of  the small box-shadow added to  the bottom of the button, lifting  it off the background just a bit.  Figure 6.14 shows the results in Safari after adding a box- shadow to the button that’s just 1px from the top with a 2px  blur. For color, we’re using black at 50% using RGBA, so that  the shadow will have some transparency to it, letting the  background behind it shine through.  And that not only completes our button, but our entire form  as well. Using a few extra lines of CSS3, we’ve molded an oth- erwise default-looking form into something a bit more styl- ized and in line with the rest of the page design. We’ve chosen  to use CSS3 here instead of images, as it’s perfectly OK and  harmless for browsers that don’t yet support these advanced  rules. Let’s take a look to make sure.  WHAT ABOUT OTHER BROWSERS? If we view our form in Internet Explorer 7, a browser that has  zero support for CSS3, we see a perfectly acceptable, function- al form  fig 6.15 . And that’s great news! All the enhancements      108   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   fig 6.15: In IE7, the form looks like a  normal form. And functions like one,  too. This is good.  we added via a handful of CSS3 rules in the stylesheet have  been safely ignored, leaving a bare-bones form that acts ex- actly as it should. Mission accomplished.  USING BOX-SHADOW   TO CREATE FOCUS STATES We could go a step further in our enrichment of this form’s  interactions by using the box-shadow property on the inputs’  focus state. It’s quick, easy, and like the aforementioned CSS3,  degrades beautifully.  It requires simply creating a new declaration and adding the  :focus pseudo-class to the attribute selector for text inputs.   By the way, the preceding paragraph is a sure-fire pickup line,  should you be in need of one. Thank me later.   thing-alerts input[type="text"]:focus {    -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 12px rgba 51, 204, 255, 0.5 ;    -moz-box-shadow: 0 0 12px rgba 51, 204, 255, 0.5 ;    box-shadow: 0 0 12px rgba 51, 204, 255, 0.5 ;    }      ENRICHING FORMS    109    This declaration includes a box-shadow stack applying a   bright blue shadow at 50% opacity around the text inputs  when they are focused. We see the results in Figure 6.16,  where we’re mimicking the default OS behavior of focused  inputs, but in creating our own we have much more control  over the appearance.   fig 6.16: A box-shadow is applied to  the :focus state of the text inputs.  Browsers that don’t support box-shadow yet? Well they just  get a normal input when focused. And I’ll bet you can guess  what I’m about to say …  yep, that’s perfectly OK.  ADDING CSS ANIMATIONS   TO ENRICH FORM INTERACTIONS Going even a step further with the box-shadow on focus treat- ment, what if the shadow was animated as well, perhaps puls- ing as if waiting for you to type. Let’s briefly take a dip into  the world of CSS Animations to make that happen in WebKit- powered browsers.  I say WebKit-powered browsers in this case because CSS  Animations  like CSS Transforms and Transitions , were ini- tially developed by the WebKit team, then folded back into a  proposed standard at the W3C  http:  bkaprt.com css3 16  .6  However, unlike Transforms and Transitions, Animations   6. The long URL: http:  www.w3.org TR CSS3-animations      110   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   have yet to be implemented by anyone else. They currently  work in Safari and Chrome, but not Firefox or Opera, nor is  there planned support in IE9. For that reason, I don’t place  as much attention on Animations  at least for now . And  while they are powerful and exciting, it remains to be seen  whether their adoption will be as comprehensive and swift  as Transforms and Transitions have been, which already have  decent  and growing  support.  Nonetheless, the concept and syntax for creating CSS  Animations is rather straightforward, and for non-critical en- hancements that only WebKit browsers will enjoy for now,  it’s fun to inject them into appropriate places. Let’s add a  simple animation to the focus state of the input to get a sense  of how it all works.  Working with keyframes The first part of building a CSS animation is to create a key- frames declaration. Those familiar with programming might  relate this to building a function that can be called and refer- enced elsewhere in the stylesheet.  A keyframe is a specialized CSS at-rule. It’s similar to a normal  CSS declaration, but allows you to name it with an identifier  and specify CSS rules and changes over the duration with a  list of percentage values  or the keywords “to” and “from” .  It’ll make more sense to just see one in practice, so let’s   create a simple animation that will fade in and fade out the  box-shadow we previously added to focused form inputs.  We’ll name it “pulse” and set three rules that differ slightly:  one at the starting point  0% , one at the halfway point  50% ,  and one at the end  100% . Each percentage rule is just adjust- ing the level of opacity of the blue box-shadow, from 20% up  to 90% and back down to 20%. This change, transitioned over  time and looped, will create the appearance of the input puls- ing when focused in WebKit-powered browsers.      ENRICHING FORMS    111    @-webkit-keyframes pulse {    0% {      -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 12px rgba 51, 204, 255, 0.2 ;    }    50% {      -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 12px rgba 51, 204, 255, 0.9 ;    }    100% {      -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 12px rgba 51, 204, 255, 0.2 ;    }  }  Here I’m specifying rules for WebKit only, using the –webkit-  vendor prefix. Previously in the book we’ve been good about  writing duplicate rules for all the vendors that currently sup- port the properties, as well as adding the non-prefixed version  for future-proofing. In this case, with CSS Animations still  unsupported in anything but Safari and Chrome, and res-  ervations from other vendors about whether animations in  fact belong in CSS at all, I’m choosing to write the –webkit-  rules only.  Referencing the keyframe  The second part of a CSS animation is referencing the   keyframe by name using the animation property.  In this case, we want this pulsing of the box-shadow to run  when a user focuses a text input in the form.  Here we’ll call  the keyframe by name, set a duration for the animation to  run, loop it infinitely, and finally set the transition timing  function of easing in and then easing out. You can see how   the syntax for animation is similar to that of a transition.  thing-alerts input[type="text"]:focus {    -webkit-animation: pulse 1.5s infinite ease-in-out;    }     112   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   With that, we’re ensuring that the pulse animation runs only  when the user focuses a text input on the form  in Safari and  Chrome only .   The result is quite stunning. Figure 6.17 shows you what hap- pens: a slow, animated fade in out of the box-shadow as if the  input is waiting to be interacted with.   fig 6.17: The pulsing animation that we’ve  added to the :focus state of the text inputs.  I used the shorthand animation property to set the values for  calling the animation all in one rule. Alternatively, you can  specify each value with its own property like so:  thing-alerts input[type="text"]:focus {    -webkit-animation-name: pulse;    -webkit-animation-duration: 1.5s;    -webkit-animation-iteration-count: infinite;    -webkit-animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;    }      ENRICHING FORMS    113    Reusing the animation on button hover One of the nice things about creating keyframes is that they  can be reused throughout the stylesheet within multiple  declarations. For example, we could apply that same “pulse”  animation to the submit button when it’s hovered or focused,  adding a Wii-like, blue-pulsing glow.  It’s as simple as adding that same animation rule to a new  :hover :focus declaration for the submit button, just as we  did with the text inputs:  thing-alerts input[type="submit"]:hover,  thing-alerts input[type="submit"]:focus {    -webkit-animation: pulse 1.5s infinite ease-in-out;    }  The pulse animation we previously created for text inputs  fades in and out a blue box-shadow—but we can use it here  on the button as well, where the effect also works nicely  fig  6.18 , glowing softly when hovered or focused, as if waiting  for the user to submit.   Fig 6.18: The pulsing of the shadow behind the button as it’s  hovered.     114   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   What about other browsers? Adding CSS Animations is the first time in the book where  we’ve really targeted just one browser vendor with our expe- rience enriching: WebKit. One of the primary reasons we’re  seeing CSS3 being used more and more is because of it’s adop- tion by Firefox, Opera, and even IE9. You might be asking if  it’s worth adding CSS Animations at this point in time. It’s  certainly something to consider.   Either CSS Animations will remain a WebKit-only technol- ogy, or it will go the way of Transitions and Transforms and  be adopted by the others. Either way, CSS Animations are  simple, require little overhead, and are safely ignored by  browsers that don’t support them. What I’ve demonstrated  here with animations is rather rudimentary, barely scratch- ing the surface of what’s possible on screen with just markup  and stylesheets. It’s exciting stuff, and for that reason alone it’s  worth experimenting with.  FOCUS ON INTERACTION It’s rare when form elements are also crucial brand elements,  and that’s precisely why forms are a fantastic opportunity to  enhance with CSS3.   Form elements differ greatly in appearance depending on the  user’s environment—but we can embrace those differences by  choosing to enrich them with advanced CSS, knowing things  will degrade to fully-functional, familiar, default form controls  in browsers that don’t yet support CSS3.       ENRICHING FORMS    115    7CONCLUSION  okay, Let’s come back down to earth now and  decompress.  We’ve covered a lot of wonderful  if I may say so  ways to   use CSS3 right now in your daily work. My hope is that by  demonstrating how these techniques can enhance the experi- ence layer in browsers that support them, while gracefully   degrading in browsers that don’t, you’ll be inspired to use  them every day, regardless of the project you’re working on.   The real promise of CSS3 is that it enables us to solve com- mon design problems more efficiently, with less code and  more flexibility. So long as you  and your clients and bosses   can accept that websites may look and be experienced differ- ently in the browsers and devices that access them, then the  sky’s the limit. Jump right in.     116   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   I mentioned back in Chapter 1 that I often hear, “I can’t wait  to use CSS3—when it’s done.” My goal with this book was to  prove that you don’t need to wait. Start experimenting with  this stuff now. Begin using CSS3 for non-critical visual events  in your designs. Now that you’re armed with what works,  and—more importantly—how things degrade when they  don’t, you can comfortably achieve what previously took  more time and code, with only a few lines of CSS.  WHAT ABOUT CLIENTS AND BOSSES   WHO DON’T GET IT? Another question I often get asked when talking about CSS3  is how to use it in client work. How do you educate clients  on the benefits of using CSS3 over other solutions? It’s the  education that’s most helpful: Show your clients how much  less code and how many fewer images there are. Show them  how the experience differs in browsers that don’t yet support  CSS3. Explain the tradeoffs to them.   If that sounds like too much work, then just do it.   Start adding CSS3 to your daily work and let your clients and  bosses happily discover it. The truth is, many of the examples  I’ve demonstrated in this book are discoverable while expe- riencing the site: hovering, focusing, interacting, etc. That’s  intentional of course.   Often, with my own client work, I’ll add this experience en- hancment into the project without saying a word about it, sur- prising and delighting the client when they stumble on it. And  more importantly, surprising and delighting the client’s visitors  when they stumble upon it.  Getting this to work in every browser imaginable? Well, that  will cost extra. Ahem.      CONCLUSION    117    LOOKING AHEAD What about the future? The whole of CSS3 encompasses  much, much more than can be covered in this small book.  I wanted to focus very squarely on what’s practically usable  today, avoiding what’s still being hashed out in other modules  that perhaps don’t have such widespread implementation.  But the track is a positive one. New property support is be- ing added in almost every new iteration of WebKit, Mozilla,  and Opera. This rapid adoption via vendor prefixing is what’s  driving innovation. Keeping tabs on what’s new, and watching  for a tipping point in implementation among these forward- thinking browsers is what can educate you on real world use.  We also have exciting times ahead by way of IE9 Beta. Yes,   I really did say that. We’re seeing more and more CSS3 sup- port being added to Internet Explorer, and that means all   good things.   Eventually, we’ll be able to rely on CSS3 not only for experi- ence enhancement, but for those critical visual concepts as  well  layout being a primary example . It’s been a seemingly  slow path to get there, but that’s necessary for things to unfold  correctly. While on that slow path, don’t hesitate to grab hold  and use what works in the present. You, your clients, and the  web’s citizens will benefit.     118   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   FURTHER READING AND RESOURCES CSS3.info has long been rounding up news, examples,   and developments:    http:  www.CSS3.info  Also see their preview section for demos of specific   properties:    http:  www.CSS3.info preview  Earlier, I told you not to read the specs, but for a relevant  big picture view, to prepare for what’s ahead, and to see  which modules are in what state  Working Draft, Candidate  Recommendation, etc. , look here:    http:  www.w3.org Style CSS current-work  Or, go here for more on the modules themselves, how they’re  broken up, and what they contain:    http:  www.w3.org TR CSS3-roadmap  The development blogs for all the major browsers are a fantas- tic place to keep up on what’s being implemented and when.

We cover the emerging and   essential topics in web design and development with style,  clarity, and, above all, brevity—because working designer- developers can’t afford to waste time.  The goal of every title in our catalog is to shed clear light on  a tricky subject, and do it fast, so you can get back to work.  Thank you for supporting our mission to provide profession- als with the tools they need to move the web forward.   COLOPHON The text is set in FF Yoga and its companion, FF Yoga Sans,  both by Xavier Dupré. Headlines and cover are set in Titling  Gothic by David Berlow, code excerpts in Consolas by Lucas  de Groot.     124   CSS3 FOR WEB DESIGNERS   ABOUT THE AUTHOR  Dan Cederholm is a web  designer, author, husband  and father living in Salem,  Massachusetts.
