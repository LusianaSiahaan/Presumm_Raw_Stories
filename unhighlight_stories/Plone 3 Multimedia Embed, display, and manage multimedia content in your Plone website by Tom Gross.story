There is almost no site  with no pictures, videos, Flash animations, or audio content. The integration of  multimedia content is the daily mission of web editors and site integrators.   Plone is a mature, stable, and flexible content management system. With the   batteries included it provides a complete and user friendly system for managing   web content. Completely object-oriented, it is well suited for extensions written   in Python.   In this book you will learn to bring these two topics together. It will show you how  you can prepare multimedia data for the Web and turn it into valuable content using  Plone. With step-by-step examples you will learn how to use Plone and add-ons to  provide an appealing multimedia web experience.  What this book covers Chapter 1, Plone and Multimedia, tells you what multimedia is all about and what  you can expect from Plone. It also shows some reasons why we can, and should,   use our favorite Open Source CMS Plone for some additional multimedia candy. Chapter 2, Managing Image Content, shows how we can add images, organize them  in folders with thumbnail view, and how to access them. It also discusses two   gallery products. Chapter 3, Managing Audio Content, shows how to add audio content to Plone  and enhance its features with Plone4Artists products. It also shows how to include  audio data in HTML with plugins and Flash. Chapter 4, Managing Video Content, discusses how to add video content to Plone.  It also discusses the difference between downloading and streaming, and various  products used for enhancing videos in Plone.   Preface  Chapter 5, Managing Flash Content, shows how to include Flash and Silverlight in  Plone. It discusses two products that help in improving the inclusion of Flash   content in Plone. Chapter 6, Content Control, investigates classic categorization methods. It glances at  some products that ease or extend the categorization methods of the default Plone  CMS. It also looks at the important techniques of tagging and rating, and few more  techniques of content control. Chapter 7, Content Syndication, talks about syndication. It shows how to use RSS  syndication with an unmodified Plone installation with collections and searches.   It also shows how to enhance syndication with add-on products. Chapter 8, Advanced Upload Techniques, shows how to get content into Plone.  It shows various approaches to upload multiple files. It also shows how to   upload files using alternative protocols such as FTP and WebDAV. Chapter 9, Advanced Storage, shows some storage mechanisms in Plone. It also  investigates publisher hooks. Chapter 10, Serving and Caching, looks at applications other than Plone such as  reverse proxy cache Varnish and Red5, and how to use use CacheFu and also to   set cache headers. Appendix A, Multimedia Formats and Licenses, looks at details of formats and codecs  used for the storage and transmission of audio and video content. It also looks at the  Creative Commons licenses, which can be used to license open  multimedia  content. Appendix B, Syndication Formats, looks at specifications of RSS 2.0, Atom, and the  MediaRSS syndication format extension. Appendix C, Links and Further Information, discusses how to use different sources  such as the Web, e-mails, and so on to find Plone add-ons and links to selected  multimedia topics.  What you need for this book To run the examples included with the book, you will need Python   version 2.4 compiled from the sources or installed from an installer available from  http:  www.python.org . All the examples contain the full application stack  including Zope version 2.10.9 and Plone 3.3.3 in the form of a buildout configuration.  You can use a Plone from the UnifiedInstaller available at http:  plone.org  products plone and change the buildout configuration accordingly.   [ 2 ]   The examples are intended to work on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, if not  indicated otherwise. This book is for Plone integrators who want to extend the core  of Plone with multimedia features. It gives no introduction to Plone and readers  should know how to set up a Plone site using a buildout. The book can be read and  understood well without being a Python developer, though some examples have  Python code included.

[ 5 ]    Plone and Multimedia  Multimedia is the dominant part of the World Wide Web as we face it today. Every  site has at least some images to give the site visitor a better "picture" of the presented  content. Web-based multimedia services such as YouTube, Flickr, and Picasa are  growing rapidly and there seems to be no end in sight.  Plone is a Web Content Management System written to serve big amounts of web  content in a secure and professional manner. Do these two concepts go together?   Can Plone meet the requirements of a shiny multimedia web?  This book will show you how to turn your multimedia data into valuable web  content with Plone. It will show you how to utilize third-party products to make   the most out of your favorite CMS. Let's start with some general discussion about   the topics that this book will cover.  Some definitions Before we can dig into the topic, we need some definitions of the key terms.   These terms will follow us through the book.  CMS CMS stands for Content Management System. It is a general term covering several  types of software intended to store, manage, and provide digital data. Digital data  that is managed by a CMS is referred to as content.  There are several types of content management systems: Document management  systems, Digital Records Management systems, Electronic Content Management  systems, web-based content management systems, and others.   Plone and Multimedia  Plone is a classic web-based CMS. Editing and viewing of the content is completely  done through the Web. Although there are other means of feeding Plone with  data and getting it in and out again, the web browser is the main interface for the  interaction of humans with Plone.  In the book, we will see alternative methods for interacting with Plone.  ZCA The ZCA is the Zope Component Architecture. It was introduced with Zope 3 and  is now part of Zope 2, and therefore of Plone with the help of the Five product  2+3 .  This strategy, which shares many ideas with the Mozilla Component Architecture,  allows us the use of adapters and utilities.  With adapters, we can do so-called aspect oriented programming. An adapter  represents a certain aspect of a context object. A simple example of an adapter is a  size adapter that calculates the size of an object. How this is done depends on the  nature of the context. It can be as simple as calling the len method on the context,  or there can be a complex function behind it. A simple adapter call  without the  definition and the registration  looks like this:  >>> ISize context  >>> 587  Adapters can have more than one context. These adapters are called multi-adapters.  One example is a BrowserView, which takes a content object and the request as  context. BrowserViews are certain aspects of the content in a publishing situation.  Utilities are methods or classes  Callables  stored in a registry and, therefore,   easy to acquire. An example of a utility is a vocabulary. The underlying method  returns an iterator of term objects. These term objects may be used for choice or  selection widgets.  A good introduction to the ZCA can be found in Philipp von  Weitershausen's book Web Component Development with Zope 3.  The book is slightly outdated, but still a good source for learning  the ZCA with examples.  In this book we will focus on products utilizing the ZCA, if possible. These products  are more flexible, and overriding an adapter for custom purposes is easier and better  than monkey patching.  [ 8 ]   Chapter 1  WWW The WWW  World Wide Web  is the playground of Plone. Many web pages use the  domain name "www", but this is not meant here.  What is meant here is the sum of all web pages and portals that are reachable with  a web browser. Technically speaking, this is everything with an URL. Usually URLs  accessible with a web browser utilize HTTP  HyperText Transfer Protocol  or FTP   File Transfer Protocol .  Buildout The term buildout is used for two things: a piece of software, correctly spelled as  zc.buildout, and a concept for configuring software using zc.buildout.  Since version 3.0, Plone is distributed with a buildout. In the common use of the  term, buildout refers to one or more files used for configuration. This file is usually  called buildout.cfg and contains all the necessary bits and pieces for fetching the  Plone application from online resources and configuring it. This file can be extended  to install and configure arbitrary add-on products.  There are ready available buildouts for special use cases such as publication  management with Plone, a video suite for Plone, and a newsletter application   with Plone; or they can be put together with ZopeSkel templates.  Possibly, the shortest buildout for setting up Plone 3.3.3 is this:  [buildout] parts =     zope2     instance extends =     http:  dist.plone.org release 3.3.3 versions.cfg versions = versions  [zope2] recipe = plone.recipe.zope2install url = ${versions:zope2-url}  [instance] recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance zope2-location = ${zope2:location} user = admin:admin http-address = 8080 eggs =      Plone  [ 9 ]   Plone and Multimedia  The code examples in this book are available together with readymade buildouts,  which set up Plone and the necessary multimedia parts.  What is multimedia? According to Wikipedia, multimedia is:  ... media and content that uses a combination of different content forms. The term  can be used as a noun  a medium with multiple content forms  or as an adjective  describing a medium as having multiple content forms. The term is used in  contrast to media, which only use traditional forms of printed or hand-produced  material. Multimedia includes a combination of text, audio, still images, animation,  video, and interactivity content forms.  This is a very formal definition. In common language use, "multimedia" is simply  images, audio, video, and animations  including interactive ones . Today, we face  multimedia in many aspects of our daily life. Probably most of us have a digital  camera. We play with interactive multimedia terminals when we go to the museum.  We watch DVD movies now and then, and last but not least we use the World Wide  Web to enjoy and share multimedia of all different forms.  The Web did not always have the multimedia capabilities that it has today. It started  merely as a text and image platform with the brilliant idea of hyperlinks.  With the growth of the Web, the requirements followed. People wanted to publish  other forms of media. The browser companies reacted and Netscape, the leading  browser manufacturer at that time, introduced the embed element and Microsoft  the object element to include arbitrary multimedia contents into a web page.  Embedding a multimedia object  a MIDI soundfile  in Netscape looks like this:     Including a sound file in Microsoft looks like this:  <object  classid="clsid:22D6F312-B0F6-11D0-94AB-0080C74C7E95">          [ 10 ]   Chapter 1  This method is still the common technique to include multimedia content into an  HTML page. While the object element was included into the HTML standard, the  embed element was never officially supported. Still it is a common way to include  multimedia contents into Mozilla-based browsers  the successors of the Netscape  browser . It is possible to merge the embed and the object element to get maximum  availability on different browsers. We will learn how we can achieve this for audio,  video, and Flash content in this book.  In HTML5, the situation will change completely. With this version there will be  dedicated elements for audio and video. Including audio will be as simple as this:     Your browser does not support the audio element.     And video:     Your browser does not support the video tag     Today, the common browsers only partially support HTML5, and the W3C  consortium does not recommend it yet.  In the Web, there are other ways of distributing multimedia content than on HTML  pages. One common way to do it is with syndication.  Multimedia feeds are used  to provide audio and video content on a regular basis. This technique is known as  podcast or vodcast.  In this book, we will see how to present our multimedia content  from Plone in a syndication feed.  In this book, we will deal with the following types of multimedia in the first place:   	  Images: The classic type of multimedia. Besides playing with some metadata  we fetch from our digital camera, we will see how we can display images in  an appealing gallery in the Web.   	 Audios: We will learn about different audio formats and their qualification  for web usage. Audio is usually included into web pages with small player  applets, and we will see how.   	 Videos: Videos are really multimedia, as they combine moving images and  audio. We will see how to include videos from content stored in our Plone  CMS and from content fetched from external sources. We will learn the  differences between downloading and streaming, and see how to embed  video player applets into our Plone-served web pages.   	 Flash and SilverLight: Flash and SilverLight are interactive forms of   multimedia. To function properly through the Web, some requirements   have to be met. We will see how to meet these with Plone.  [ 11 ]   Plone and Multimedia  Why Plone? If you are reading this book, you have heard of Plone and used it before. You want  to know how to extend the great content management features with multimedia  goodies. Why is Plone suitable for managing multimedia content? First of all, Plone  is a great CMS. It is:   	 Secure: Plone builds on the Zope application server. In contrast to other   Web-based systems, security is an integral component of the application.  Every object in the object database is protected and all content in Plone   can be allocated to a security workflow.   	 Stable: Plone is a mature system, which has been around now for many   years and is widely used all over the world. A strong community fixes   the bugs quickly.    	 Easy to work with: With the CMS features of Plone, no HTML knowledge   is necessary to publish web content. Most configuration settings for  administrators and integrators are accessible through the Web.   	 Professional: There are Plone consultant companies in many countries.   Web solutions using Plone can be found in many intranets and extranets.  	 Extensible: One of the most interesting advantages of Plone for us is the   ability to extend it. There are hundreds of small and big add-ons for turning  Plone in a weblog, newsletter tool, or even a complete multimedia solution.  These features make Plone suitable for many different use cases dealing with the  problem of getting binary data into and out of the WWW.  For data storage, Plone uses the Zope Object DataBase  ZODB , which is an   object-oriented database written in Python and C. It is especially good at storing  objects, but is not so good at storing large files.  Unfortunately, multimedia data tends to be stored in large files. One minute of   CD-quality audio takes around 10 megabytes. There are compression methods   for images, audio, and video but a one-minute audio encoded with the MP3 format  still takes 1 megabyte.  Fortunately, there are methods for storing and accessing multimedia data outside   the ZODB. In Chapter 9, we will learn how to do this.  Since version 3.8, the ZODB has had BLOB  Binary Large Object  support. Large  binary data is not stored in the internal structure, but on the filesystem. This makes  storage and publishing more efficient. In Plone 4, this will be the standard backend  for the File and Image content types. In Chapter 9, we will see how we can use the  BLOB features with Plone 3.3.  [ 12 ]   Chapter 1  Plone Content Plone comes with eight content types useful for creating web content: Folder,  Collection, Page, Event, News Item, Link, File, and Image.  Folder and Collection are not real content on their own. Their purpose is to structure  content. Yet they play an important role in Plone because we can define views on  them showing certain aspects of the content included. This can be an image gallery  view, a blog view, a tabular listing, a summary view, or even an RSS feed view used  for syndication of the content.  While a Folder is an object in which data is actually stored, a Collection is an object   that gathers the main information about different objects. This information is   collected from various content objects of the portal with the help of the catalog.  All other content types are web content and depending on the definition of  multimedia, they are multimedia or can contain multimedia.  News items are meant to promote news on the website. They can contain rich  text and an image with a caption. They are made for special purposes and are not  appropriate for general multimedia content.   The Event content type is for calendric events. It has a start and an end date, and  some additional information concerning the event. It is not appropriate for the  storage of multimedia content. In a complete multimedia platform, it may still play  an important role. Consider a website of a band. It stores some demo material as  MP3, and announces concerts and CD releases as Events.  The Plone4Artists initiative provides an enhanced version of the Event content type  that supports recurring events.  The most important content type in real-life situations is probably the Page. A Page  is simply an HTML page edited with a Visual Editor. According to the definition  of multimedia, a text is multimedia already—especially if it contains other visual  elements such as images or videos. In the common usage of the term, a Page is  seldom recognized as multimedia.  The most important content types for multimedia are Image and File. The role of  the Image content type is quickly told. Its purpose is to wrap a digital image to be  treated as web content. Therefore, it comes with a set of metadata, some predefined  scales, and the ability to be included into a Page.  The File content type is a container for all other data that does not fit in another  category. Arbitrary files can be uploaded into Plone via the Web. These files are  displayed if possible  text  or provided as download  binary . Except for the usual  metadata, this is it for a default installation of Plone.  [ 13 ]   Plone and Multimedia  One important datum that is stored with a File is its MIME type. This helps other  products to distinguish between audios, videos, and other forms of multimedia,   and activate certain components and views available for this type.  It is notable that neither the Image nor the File content types have a workflow  attached by default. It is assumed that content objects of this type are always  available to the public audience of the site. Still, it is possible to define a workflow   for one or both of these content types.  Luckily, the behavior of Plone's content types can easily be enhanced with the  help of the ZCA. With some readymade add-ons, it is possible to have specialized  File content for audio, video, or Flash. With some Python knowledge, it is not too  difficult to write a custom add-on for the multimedia forms of the future.  Finally, there is the Link content type. With this, it is possible to store references to  arbitrary points in the WWW locatable by an URL. The standard behavior of Links  is to go to its stored location. But it is possible to change this. Some multimedia  add-ons for Plone utilize the Link content type for referring to external multimedia  resources, especially audio and video. The display of the content is handled by a  customized Plone view of the Link object, but the content is stored and published  from the external location. This saves bandwidth and storage space.  How do they fit? Now we know about multimedia in the Web context, and we know about Plone  and its advantages. But do they go together? Isn't it like breaking a butterfly on a  wheel to use a full-featured Content Management System like Plone for adding   some specific multimedia tags to an HTML page?  No, it is not! Adding these tags is not sufficient in many cases. Like other content,  it is protected by permissions and not all users are allowed to access every item.  Multimedia content may pass through a publishing workflow like textual content.  We need instruments to upload multimedia content from the creator to the server.  And we want alternate views on our multimedia content. We want to download   the binary file, we want an embedded player, and we want a syndicated feed.  For all these tasks, a sophisticated Content Management System is a number one  requirement. And Plone can do it! For some of the use cases, it needs a little help  from other products, but that's the way it is build—good at managing content and  extensible. Let's glance on the common multimedia extensions.  [ 14 ]   Chapter 1  Plone4Artists The main initiative, which aims at bringing multimedia features to Plone, is  Plone4Artists. Nate Aune, who is a musician himself, brought up the idea to   have a complete bundled add-on for Plone serving all the needs for musicians   and other artists.   The first implementation dates back to 2005 and was targeted at Plone 2.0. The  Plone4Artists suite was a set of content types, one for each form of multimedia:  ATVideo, ATAudio, and ATPhoto.  With the rise of the ZCA, the products were rewritten and the content types   were dropped. The version of P4A that was implemented for Plone 2.5 reuses   the existing content type File and attaches all multimedia specific parts via the   ZCA onto the content type. For Plone 3.0, all the relevant products where   repackaged in the p4a namespace. Then the development slowed down a little bit  and some packages even became orphaned. Recently, the code repository moved over from plone4artists.org to the collective  repository. This decision reactivated the contribution to the project.  The whole bundle now consists of the following parts:   	 p4a.ploneimage: Enhancements for the Image content type. Some   photo-specific metadata is attached to the image. Most of the code evolved  from the ATPhoto product. This is probably the most unfinished package of  all. The basic functionality is there, though.    	 p4a.ploneaudio: Enhancements for the File content type to bring audio   features. The code for this package evolved from ATAudio and brings  embedded players, additional metadata for audio content, and basic support  for podcasting.    	 p4a.plonevideo: Enhancements for the File content type to bring video  features. This package is meant for videos stored inside Plone as content.  Most of the code is taken from ATVideo. It comes with embedded players  for various video formats and basic support for vodcasting.    	 p4a.plonevideoembed: Enhancements for the Link content type. This  product is meant to include external video sources, such as YouTube,  Metacafe, or Yahoo video into Plone. It comes with views to integrate videos  from the external sources into the desired context.     	 p4a.plonecalendar and p4a.ploneevent: Probably the best maintained  part of the p4a bundle. These products bring extensions to the Folder and  the Event content type. They allow a Folder with Events to act as a calendar  with all the necessary logic and views. Additionally, recurring events   are supported.   [ 15 ]   Plone and Multimedia   	 p4a.plonetagging: Another more or less orphaned but working solution for   an alternative content tagging solution based on the ZCA.   Summary In this chapter, we did some position fixing about the subject. We saw what  multimedia is all about and what we can expect from Plone. We found some   reasons why we can, and should, use our favorite Open Source CMS Plone for   some additional multimedia candy.   The common approach for turning Plone into a "multimedia web machine" is to use  the Plone4Artists products. These add-on products turn the core content types of  Plone into multimedia-enhanced ones.  With Plone and its core features, it is possible to turn binary data into valuable   web content. In the following chapters, we will see how we can achieve this.   Let's start with images in the next chapter.  [ 16 ]   Managing Image Content  Images are one of the oldest and still one of the most popular and important types of  multimedia content of the Web. The img element has been available and supported  since the beginning of HTML. Displaying a few images on a static HTML page is  not sufficient in most cases today. Normally, we will have lots of images that we  want to organize and present as a slideshow and we probably want to provide  different views to different classes of users. We might want to display downscaled  and watermarked images to anonymous users, and original-sized images to  authenticated users. It's very likely that we have additional data, such as tags or  photographic details, that we want to store with the image or that we want to link  the image with other content we already have. Like every other sensible CMS, Plone  has support for managing images out of the box. Plone comes with the content type  "Image", which basically stores binary data from a file in the ZODB and marks it as  an image. With current versions of Plone, it is even possible to do some basic image  manipulations such as mirroring and flipping.  In this chapter, we will first investigate the default features of Plone's image  managing features and then see some mechanisms to enhance these features.   We will see how we can arrange image content nicely using gallery products   and present images in a slideshow.   Additionally, we will see how to access external image databases such as Flickr  or Picasa for including image content in our site. Finally, we will create a small  custom product that collects all the presented image enhancement products for us.  Furthermore, it does some missing and useful configuration of these products, and  provides an image view with a watermark included.  Here is a list of the topics that are covered in this chapter:   	 The Image content type of Plone  	 Accessing and manipulating images in Plone  	 Enhancing the Image content type with p4a.ploneimage   Managing Image Content  slideshowfolder  view with Plone   	 The gallery products collective.plonetruegallery and    	 Accessing external image resources such as Picasa or Flickr in a gallery     	 Using PIL to create a watermarked image  The Image content type The base for all considerations in this chapter is the content type Image. Most products  available use or refer to this content type for all their image actions. The most notable  exception is the use of external image data sources for displaying slideshows.  Adding images with an unmodified Plone Let's add an image first. We do so by choosing Image from the View  Add new...  menu as shown in the following screenshot:  Like any other content type in Plone, Image has a title, description, and some more  metadata to be specified when it is added. Unlike most other content types, the title  is not required. If it is omitted, the filename of the uploaded image is used as the  title. The filename is always used as the ID  short name  of the content. Thus, adding  another image with the same name to a container will result in an error.  [ 18 ]   Chapter 2  Adding an image with Plone 4 This behavior will change slightly from Plone 4 onwards. Like any other  content types, the ID will be computed from the title field rather than  just using the filename of the uploaded image. All other mechanisms   won't change.   After uploading the image, we see the usual View, Edit, and Sharing tabs.  Additionally, there is an image-specific Transform tab.   In the Transform tab, we find a selection of tools for limited image manipulation  support. The actual processing of the image is done by the PIL  Python Imaging  Library   http:  www.pythonware.com products pil  , which is a dependency  of Plone.  We have the following options for image transformation:   	 Flip around vertical axis  	 Flip around horizontal axis  	 Rotate 90 counterclockwise  	 Rotate 180  	 Rotate 90 clockwise  These options are pretty much self-explanatory. One use case might be to quickly   fix some digital camera photos, which were shot in portrait format instead of  landscape format.  [ 19 ]   Managing Image Content  Customizing image transforms If you want to change or extend these options, you should look at  the lib imagetransform.py module of the ATContentTypes  product. The relevant part is the transformImage method of the  ATCTImageTransform class. This is a base class of the ATImage class.  To get a custom behavior, you might want to hook it in here.   Working with sizes When we talk about the size of a digital image, we either mean the dimensions,  the length and width of an image, or we mean the size of the file containing the  image. The file sizes of images can vary enormously, depending on what format and  compression we use. JPEG  Joint Photographic Experts Group  is a commonly used  image format on the Internet, as it can compress image data very well. This saves  resources for storing and downloading images.  Dimension Normally if an image object is stored to the ZODB, the Archetype storage mechanism  will create some predefined scaled images and store them together with the original  image. The following sizes are generated:  Name Large Preview Mini Thumb Tile Icon Listing  Dimensions  width x height  in pixels 768 x 768 400 x 400 200 x 200 128 x 128 64 x 64 32 x 32 16 x 16  Limiting sizes If we allow the upload of images from different users, we can restrict the size for  uploaded images. With Plone it is possible to restrict both dimension and file size.  For this purpose, we will need a configuration file stored in one of three places. The  files are prioritized as follows:  [ 20 ]   Chapter 2  1.  A file called atcontenttypes.conf, which is stored in the etc directory of   our Zope instance.  2.  A file called atcontenttypes.conf, which is stored in the etc directory of   the Products.ATContentTypes product.  3.  A file called atcontenttypes.conf.in, which is stored in the etc directory   of the Products.ATContentTypes product.  Option 3 comes with the product and is mainly used as a fallback or as a template for  custom configuration.  Not all values present in the file are used for image configuration. To limit the sizes  of image content, we use the following snippet:       maximum file size in byte, kb or mb   max_file_size no    maximum image dimension  w, h     0,0 means no rescaling of the original image   max_image_dimension 0,0    The comment in the default configuration file is misleading. We can  specify only byte values here. For kilobyte  KB , multiply with 1024  and for megabyte  MB , multiply with 1024*1024. For example, if you  want to allow images up to 700 KB, the value would be 716800.  In a buildout environment, the persistence of a configuration file of the first type  cannot be guaranteed. There is a buildout recipe  plone.recipe.atcontenttypes   http:  pypi.python.org pypi plone.recipe.atcontenttypes   aimed at this  issue. The recipe manages the configuration in the buildout. All we need to do is to  specify the parameters in the buildout.cfg file. The recipe takes care of creating the  configuration file in the right place. This allows ATContentTypes to actually find and  use it. Here is an example buildout.cfg containing the plone.recipe.atconent types recipe:  [buildout] ... parts =     ...     atct-conf ...  [atct-conf]  [ 21 ]   Managing Image Content  recipe                 = plone.recipe.atcontenttypes zope-instance-location = ${instance:location}  allow files up to 500kb max-file-size          = ATImage:512000 max-image-dimension    = ATImage:1024,1024  If we run the buildout, a warning is emitted:  Installing atct-conf. The atct-conf install returned None.  A path or iterable os paths  should be returned.  We can safely ignore this warning as no path is actually affected, just a configuration  file is created.   Uploading a file, which exceeds the given file size limit will raise an error as shown  in the following screenshot:  [ 22 ]   The uploading will take place even if you specify image dimension limits. Specifying  an image dimension limit will not prevent the download but will simply downscale  the image to the given size..   Chapter 2  If you remove the recipe from your buildout, the configuration file  stays in its position. You have to remove it manually or reinstall  the instance part  not update!  of your buildout.  Accessing images We uploaded a standalone image to our CMS and surely want to work with it.  Therefore, we need to access it. There are many ways to access image content in  Plone. First, let's have a look at how images can be accessed with URLs. This is  probably the most common use case.  URL access We have four options to access an image per URL:   	 View  URL view : Shows the preview sized image in the current Plone   main_template.   	 Raw image  URL : Shows the original image.  	 Full-screen mode  URL image_view_fullscreen : Shows a fullscreen   version of the image with the original dimensions, without the   main_template, just with a back to the site link above the image.   	 Scaled image  URL image_SCALE : Shows a scaled version of the image.  For example, http:  mysite.com photo image_mini will display the content item  "photo" with the scaled maximum dimension  either height or width  of 200 pixels in  our browser.  Page template access Another way to access an Image in a page template is the use of the tag method.  It looks like this:  <img src="" alt=""       tal:replace="structure python:image.tag scale='thumb',                                                title=image.                                                     Description   "  >  [ 23 ]   Managing Image Content  The tag method takes the scale, height, width, alt, css_class, title parameters,  and additional keyword arguments. The tag methods are explained here:   	 scale: Choose one of the predefined Archetype scales here.  	 height and width: These values will be used for the img attributes with the   same name.  If the predefined scales don't match your needs, you can override the   display size of an image. But be aware that the image scaling algorithms   of the current browsers are usually very bad. If you have lots of images   of a certain size, consider adding a custom scale.  Let's assume you have an image with a size of one megabyte and you  use image.tag  height=40, width=40  in your template. Every  user who wants to see the 40x40 pixel image needs to download one  megabyte first. This is, of course, bandwidth-consuming.   	 css_class: Specify a CSS class for the image here.  	 alt and title: Set values for the img attributes with the same name.  	 Keyword arguments: Set custom attributes for the image tag. These will  be rendered in the form  key="value" . For example, you might want to   set the longdesc attribute, such as longdesc="some value".  Calling the tag method will result in a string of the form    to be embedded into a page template. Make sure to use the structure directive, if  doing so.  Python code access We can access image data in Python code. We get the data by calling the getImage  method of the image context.  >>> image = context.getImage    The getImage method will return the content of an Archetype image field, which  will be a Zope Image object. The raw data of the image, which we might need for  PIL manipulation, is stored in the data attribute. To get a file-like object out of it, we  need to do the following:  >>> rawimage = StringIO str image.data    [ 24 ]   Chapter 2  For additional information on how to work with image content with  low-level Python, take a look at the ImageField implementation of  the Archetypes product.  Field access If we write our own custom content types, we might want to include an image  as well. We can refer to the News content type as an example. For this purpose,  Archetypes provide a special field combined with a widget we have already seen  when working with an Image content type. The ImageField field is defined in the  Field module of Archetypes and exposed via the atapi module. It comes with the  following properties:  Key type original_size max_size sizes swallowResizeExceptions pil_quality pil_resize_algo widget content_class  Default value Image None None {'thumb': 80,80 } False 88 PIL_ALGO ImageWidget Image  The type property is used to distinguish the different field types and will not  change very often. For a custom implementation, photo might be a sensible option. An image is rescaled to the original_size value if this value is present. The  original_size value is stored as a tuple of width and height. An uploaded image  is downscaled to the max_size value if it exceeds the size keeping the aspect ratio.  If both original_size and max_size are present, the max_size value is used. The sizes value is stored as a dictionary. The scale names are used as keys, and size  tuples are the values. If an image is uploaded, pictures of these defined scales are  created. These scales can be accessed via URL as we have seen for an Image content  type already. As the name suggests, the swallowResizeExceptions value will swallow  exceptions occurring when scaling an image, if set to True.  [ 25 ]   Managing Image Content  The pil_quality and pil_resize_algo values are parameters used  for the PIL resizing mechanism. The PIL_ALGO is an alias for the  PIL.Image.ANTIALIAS algorithm. Like every other Archetype field, the ImageField supports the widget property,  which defaults to the ImageWidget defined by the Archetypes product. The content_class used for the ImageField is Image, which is a slightly modified  Image class from OFS.Image of Zope.  Of course, all the other properties commonly available to Archetype content such  as default_content_type, allowable_content_types, storage, and so on are  also available for the field. These properties do not play an important role for Image  content. The default_content_type is used if no MIME type can be guessed from  the extension or the information found in the binary data.  The field is now accessed by its accessor, which is either defined or constructed from  the name of the field. In the first case, we set the accessor property to the accessor  method. In the second case, the name of the accessor is the get prefix plus the  capitalized fieldname. Let's assume the field is called photo. In that case, the accessor  would be getPhoto. This will return an instance of the content_class. For the  default case, this would be the Image class and can be further processed as described  in the Python code access section earlier in this chapter.  Workflow One thing that is special about the Image content type, which is contrary to most other  content types, is the lack of a workflow with the standard Plone setup. Images inherit  the permission settings of the container they are placed in. If you need to, you still can  create a workflow for images and register it with the portal_workflow; or you can use  an existing one such as the plone_workflow or the simple_publication_workflow.  Creating a custom workflow is beyond of the scope of this book.  The thumbnail view In the beginning of this chapter we talked about organizing a bunch of images. The  technique we use for this in Plone is simple folders. Plone comes with a special view  for folders containing mainly images. This view provides thumbnails for all contained  images. To make a folder an "image folder", we need to change the default display of  the folder to the thumbnail view. What we will see then is an album of the images  stored in the container. The thumbnails used are the thumb-sized scales  128x128  pixels  of the images. The thumbnail view is batched with a batch size of 12 images.  [ 26 ]   Other content items are listed below the album view. The following screenshot  shows what a thumbnail view of images looks like:  Chapter 2  The template used is atct_album_view.pt from the ATContentTypes product.  Every subfolder that is created inside a thumbnail folder will  automatically inherit the thumbnail default view. Of course, you can  change this behavior if you want to later. This behavior only applies  to new subfolders. The subfolders present at the time of a change  keep their original view.  [ 27 ]   Managing Image Content  Using images in pages and news items We can use all images we add as a content type in any document of the site by  linking it with Kupu. Therefore, we create a page and open the image dialog box at  the position in the text where we want the image to be inserted. This is shown in the  following screenshot:  Using the dialog box, we navigate through the site until we find the image we  want to use; or we can use the Search at the top right of the screen. Globbing is not  available here. For example, duck.jpg will only find duck.jpg, while duck* will  find anything starting with "duck" such as "duckboy" and "duckgirl".  A preview of the navigated image is shown and we can set a couple of options  before including the image into the text. It is possible to specify the alignment, the  predefined Archetype scales, and a text equivalent. This text is rendered in the  alt attribute of the image tag. This is used for barrier-free browsing or pure-text  browsing. So we have to make sure we use something sensible here. The image title  is used as a standard value if the input is omitted.  [ 28 ]   Chapter 2  The link to the image is saved on the page, not on the image itself. If you  change the picture of the standalone image you have created before, the  new image will be displayed on the page.  All of the preceding is applicable to News Items, Collections, and custom content  types where Rich Text fields are used.  Customizing Kupu's image features Sometimes we need to customize the way the image is presented on a page. This  may be because the CD  Corporate Design  tells us to do so, or we simply want our  page to look very special. There are two ways of customizing Kupu. One way we can  customize it through the Web by accessing the Plone control panel  Visual editor. Here we have a lot of options to configure Kupu, but only some of them are of  interest for changing the image behavior. One of these is Link using UIDs. As this  is a general flag, it's not just the images that are affected. Every content object in  Plone has a unique identifier called the UID. This UID does not change for the entire  lifetime of an object, even if it is moved or renamed. If the Link using UIDs flag is  set, then this UID is used to store the reference between the edited rich text and the  content item instead of the path. This means that moving and renaming an image  object still keeps the reference to the rich text, where it is included, intact. This option  is not enabled by default; but most of the time, time enabling this is a good idea.  We will need the UID links if we want captioning of images turned on. If the  captioning feature is enabled, Kupu will display the description of the image in  a dd tag with the image-caption class under the image. The rendered HTML of  captioned images looks like this:                <img src="http:  localhost:8080 site mypic.jpg image_preview"              alt="mypic.jpg" title="mypic.jpg"          height="295" width="400">            Description        [ 29 ]   Managing Image Content  Around the image, there is a dl tag with the image-inline and captioned CSS  classes. The img tag is enclosed by the dt tag and a link pointing to the original  image. The dd tag with the caption has an extra style attribute containing the width  of the image. In the given example, the image is preview sized. Hence, the width is  set to 400 pixels.  Link to UID migration If you are considering using captions, you should set the two  necessary options, Link using UIDs and Allow captioned images  before adding content to the site. Yet there is the chance to migrate  path links to the UID links at a later time. Go to Visual Editor in  the control panel. At the Links tab, you can select the content types  available for migration. Clicking on relative path  uids triggers the  migration.  Finally, there's the Allow original size images flag for configuring the image  behavior of Kupu. Normally, we can choose one of the Archetype scales for  including an image into a page. We may want to allow the insertion of the   original-sized image by our editors with this flag.   Styling images Most of the styling options for displaying the image in the text can be found in  Plones' public.css.    * Kupu image alignment classes *  .image-left { float: left; clear: both; margin: 0.5em 1em 0.5em 0; border: 1px solid Black; } .image-inline { float: none; } .image-right { float: right; clear: both; margin: 0.5em; border: 1px solid Black; } dd.image-caption { text-align:left; padding: 0; margin:0; }  [ 30 ]   Chapter 2  We now assume our corporate design tells us to remove the black border from   the left-adjusted image.  For the customization, we have to do the following: From the Plone control panel   we go to the Zope Management Interface. There we descend to portal_skins   plone_styles  ploneCustom.css. We click on the Customize button to create an  editable copy in the custom folder of portal_skins. We put the following lines in  the editable area:  dl.captioned { padding: 10px; }  .image-left {    border: none; }  That's it. Displaying a page with a left-aligned image will show the wanted behavior.  To see the changes, you will probably have to turn on the development  mode of the portal_css; otherwise the stylesheets are cached. This is good  for production environments, but not so effective when developing  designing a site, as we do not see our changes immediately.  Use different sizes for presentation Now let's put together the things we have seen so far and make them persistent. We  probably want to reuse them with other sites.  Generating a package boilerplate First, let's generate a boilerplate product. As most Plone extensions share quite a bit of  common code, there is a product called ZopeSkel  http:  pypi.python.org pypi  ZopeSkel  that generates this boilerplate for us. ZopeSkel is easily installed with:  $ easy_install-2.4 "ZopeSkel>=2.12"  If you use the Unified Installer of Plone, you have ZopeSkel already  installed. Otherwise, you should consider putting it into a virtual Python  2.4 environment, instead of using the system Python. More information  on using virtual Python environments can be found on the home page of  virtualenv: http:  virtualenv.openplans.org .  [ 31 ]   Managing Image Content  We now create a theme template, which is not exactly what we want but it comes  very close. In the src directory of our buildout, we run:  $ paster create -t plone3_theme We are asked to make some settings. Most of these settings have default values and  we can leave them as they are.  Enter project name: mm.enhance Variables:   egg:      mm.enhance   package:  mmenhance   project:  mm.enhance Enter namespace_package  Namespace package  like plonetheme    ['plonetheme']: mm Enter package  The package contained namespace package  like example    ['example']: enhance Enter skinname  The skin selection to be added to 'portal_skins'  like  'My Theme'   ['']: Multimedia Enhancements ... Enter empty_styles  Override default public stylesheets with empty  ones?  [True]: False ... Enter description  One-line description of the package  ['An  installable theme for Plone 3']: Some Multimedia Enhancements For  Plone ...  These values are used as metadata for the egg. These are stored in the setup.py  file of the egg and can be changed at any time later. We choose mm.enhance  as the project name. mm is the namespace of the package and stands as a shortcut  for "multimedia". The actual name is "enhance" and refers to the purpose of the  product providing some multimedia enhancements for Plone  Depending on the version of ZopeSkel you are using, it might be  necessary to remove the following line in the setup.py file of the  freshly created product: paster_plugins = ["ZopeSkel"]  What we have now is the layout for a new egg  mm.enhance . We can now add this  to our buildout:  [buildout] ... develop =    ...    src mm.enhance  [ 32 ]   Chapter 2  [instance] ... eggs =     ...     mm.enhance  Adding functionality to the boilerplate If we rerun our buildout and restart our Zope instance, our product will be  installable via the Add-on Products in Plone's control panel. But for now, it does  nothing. Let's add the previously discussed functions to our freshly created product  starting with the CSS. This is the easiest one. We copy the content of our customized  ploneCustom.css into the main.css file in the browser stylesheets directory of  our product and remove it from the custom folder of our site afterwards.  We export the GenericSetup profile and copy the kupu.xml to the profiles  default directory of our product. The following steps can do this:  In the portal_setup, choose the Export tab.  1.  From the Plone control panel, enter the ZMI. 2.  3.  Browse to Kupu Settings  Export Kupu settings and when you click on the  Export selected steps button it triggers download of a tarball containing the  kupu.xml file.  The file contains most of the Kupu settings that we changed before at the  configuration screen in the control panel.  Unfortunately, not all of our Kupu configuration can be saved in this way. Allowing  original-sized images within the visual editor is not covered with the standard  generic setup XML profile for Kupu: kupu.xml. We need to put the code into the  setupVarious method of the setuphandler.py module:  from Products.CMFCore.utils import getToolByName  def setupVarious context :     if context.readDataFile 'mm.enhance_various.txt'  is None:         return      site = context.getSite        kupu_tool = getToolByName site, 'kupu_library_tool'      kupu_tool.allowOriginalImageSize = 1  The first condition checks the existence of a file called mm.enhance_various.txt.  This file is empty and used as a marker to make sure the configuration is taken from  the right place with the right context, which is our mm.enhance product in this case.  [ 33 ]   Managing Image Content  The second part of the code gets the Kupu tool of the site and sets the  allowOriginalImageSize attribute to 1, which equals true. This actually  allows the inclusion of original-sized images in Kupu. Next, we want to add an additional scale for accessing our image by a URL, a tag  method, or Kupu. The sizes and names for the predefined Archetype scales are  hardcoded with the Image content type of ATContentTypes. The scales are stored as  a dictionary called sizes with the name as the key and the dimensions tuple as the  value. We have seen these before when looking at the access methods for image data.  Fortunately, there is an easy way to patch the defined scales. We add the following  code to the __init__ module of our mm.enhance product:   from Products.ATContentTypes.content.image import ATImageSchema  sizes = ATImageSchema['image'].sizes sizes.update {'vga':  640, 480 }  ATImageSchema['image'].sizes = sizes  In the first line of the patch, we get the original schema for the Image content type.  It is imported from the ATContentTypes product. Then we get the sizes dictionary,  add our custom scale named vga with a width of 640 pixels and a height of 480  pixels, and write it back to the schema.  To make sure everything works as expected, we can unit test the patch with the  following unittest method:  def test_patch self :     self.setRoles ['Manager']      self.portal.invokeFactory type_name='Image', id='img'      self.assert_ 'vga' in                   self.portal.img.getPrimaryField  .sizes   As a manager, we create an image in a testing instance and check if our scale is  available in the sizes dictionary. To execute this test method, it needs to be part  of a PloneTestCase instance. The full code can be found in the tests.py file of the  mm.enhance product.  This technique is only recommended for small sites. If you have a big  site running, you should consider subclassing ATImage and providing  a custom Image content type. You might have a look at the Products. RichImage  http:  pypi.python.org pypi Products. RichImage  product on how to do so.  [ 34 ]   Chapter 2  After successfully processing these steps, we can restart our instance. Now we can  harvest the first fruits we seeded. There should not be much change in the Plone site  we created because we had already modified all the options through the Web. But we  made the changes persistent, and we can now take the product and install it on every  Plone site. We'll have exactly the same visual behavior as we have on our first site.  What we have seen until now is how we can store pictures and images in our vanilla  Plone site and how we can include them in our pages in a custom way. We wrote  a simple customization product, which removes the black border from displayed  images in a page and adds captions to images there. Further, it allows including  original-sized and 640x480 pixel-sized images into pages. Let's move on and  investigate how the image story of Plone can be enhanced further.  Enhancing images with p4a.ploneimage For a long time, the usual  and probably only  way to enhance Plone's content types  was to subclass existing types or write new content types from scratch. Fortunately,  those days are over now and the Plone4Artists products are a good example on  how to enhance existing content types with a small effort. Let's have a look at the  image enhancing product p4a.ploneimage  http:  pypi.python.org pypi p4a. ploneimage  now. The product is in an early development state, but the important  features are available and stable. The version number of the product is 0.2. We will add these packages as a dependency of our mm.enhance package. Therefore,  we add the following code to the setup.py of mm.enhance:  install_requires=[                  'setuptools',                   -*- Extra requirements: -*-                  'p4a.common',                  'p4a.ploneimage',                  ],  This will include the two eggs, p4a.ploneimage and p4a.common, if we include our  multimedia enhancement product mm.enhance in a buildout. The p4a.common egg is  an implicit dependency of p4a.ploneimage, but is not specified in the configuration  of the p4a.ploneimage egg  setup.py . To the configure.zcml of the package, add the following code:  <configure     xmlns="http:  namespaces.zope.org zope"     xmlns:five="http:  namespaces.zope.org five"     xmlns:cmf="http:  namespaces.zope.org cmf"     i18n_domain="mm.enhance">  [ 35 ]   Managing Image Content                               The inclusion of the ZCML slots assures that the ZCML configuration of both the  p4a.common and p4a.ploneimage products is loaded. To use the features of p4a.ploneimage, we will have to install it like every other  product as an add-on product. It will list as Install Plone4Artists Image. After we  have done this, we won't see much if we change back to the content space of Plone.  There is no new content type, no tab, no configlet, and no visual change. So what is  this product good for? As we said before, the enhancement works on the existing  parts of Plone. There is no confusion with new content types and there are no  additional steps or techniques we have to obey if we work with images.  So all we have to do is to add a standard image and we will get all the nice   p4a.ploneimage features too.  Existing images in the site will stay untouched. If you need migration of  these, you may need to do it manually.  [ 36 ]   Chapter 2  Let's add another image to our site. After doing so, the additions of p4a.ploneimage  will get more visible. One thing that obviously has changed is the image overview.  With p4a.ploneimage installed, we have a nice summary of the image type, its  dimensions, and its size. The URL accessing methods  full screen, scaled, and raw   for images stay untouched!  As you might see in the screenshot example shown previously, there is a  display bug in the view. Hopefully this will be fixed with a new release of  the product.  Technically speaking, the image gets marked with two interfaces when added  as content. The first one  p4a.subtyper.interfaces.ISubtyped  marks the  content object as being subtyped. The second one  p4a.image.interfaces. IImageEnhanced  defines the type of enhancement, which is image in this case. With  these markers, it is possible to bind special behavior on the object. We can create  views for the enhanced image, or collect these marked objects, or change the skin, or  add a custom traverser for them.  [ 37 ]   Managing Image Content  Moreover, we can bind additional attributes on our content object. The most   notable addition is the Exif information, which is added by the p4a.ploneimage  standard package.  The Exchangeable Image Format  Exif  Most modern digital cameras save some additional information about the picture,  together with the picture. This information contains the camera model and some  photographic details such as the focal length, the shutter, if the flash was used,  and the ISO value. This set of information is called Exif  Exchangeable Image  File Format   http:  www.exif.org  . The Exif format is also capable of storing  geographic information about the photo if the camera supports it. With p4a.ploneimage installed, this Exif information is read from the image and  is stored with the content type. We might find several use cases for using this  information. We could expose the camera model to the full text or advanced search  as Flickr does, or we could move the photos taken at a given geographical location to  a special folder triggered by a content rule.  Removing p4a.ploneimage Be extra careful when removing the plone4artists packages from your Zope  instance. If Zope does not find the definitions of the marker interfaces, it will die  awfully. You will have to process some manual steps to remove p4a.ploneimage.  First, remove all enhanced objects or remove the marker interfaces from the images.  Check the object_provides index of the catalog to see if the p4a interfaces are still  around. If not, you can remove the product from your Zope instance. Remember  to do this offline or in a very short time frame, as any new image will be p4a. ploneimage-enhanced right away.  Image-enhanced folders Additional to the image markers, the p4a.ploneimage package provides an image  folder marker too. Following the philosophy of Plone4Artists, there is no new  content type, but the product comes with the enhancement of an existing content  type  folder in this case . If converted to an image folder, a folder gets marked with  the two interfaces:  p4a.subtyper.interfaces.ISubtyped p4a.image.interfaces.IImageContainerEnhanced  [ 38 ]   At the time of writing, the image folder didn't provide any features by itself, except  for a view that comes with the standard package. Still the marker interfaces allow us  to register custom views and components.  Let's assume we want to present the pictures of a folder as a gallery. We have two  options. We can utilize the IImageContainerEnhanced interface to write our own  view. This would lead us to a ZCML configuration like this:  Chapter 2  <page       name="my_image_container_view"       for="p4a.image.interfaces.IImageContainerEnhanced"       permission="zope2.View"       template="my-image-container.pt"       class=".image.MyImageContainerView"        >  The shown ZCML configuration is just an example with no actual functionality. It  shows the necessary information needed to provide a custom view for enhanced  image containers. Obviously, we need a name—which we are free to choose. We  bind it to the p4a.image.interfaces.IImageContainerEnhanced interface. This is  the marker of our enhanced container. We probably have a template. The template  directive takes a path value. In the shown case, the my-image-container.pt  template lives in the same directory as the ZCML configuration. And finally, we have  a view class. The view class attribute is specified in the dotted name notation. We  would have a module called image with a view class called MyImageContainerView  in the given example. Or we could use another third-party product for creating an  appealing gallery.  Gallery products for Plone Until now we have exclusively dealt with single images. As stated at the beginning  of this chapter, today this is not sufficient in most cases. It is likely we have  thousands of images stored on our hard disk or at an external provider such as Flickr  or Picasa. Commonly, these images are grouped to albums. It is a common use case  to display these albums as an automatic or a manual slideshow. For Plone, there  are two products that aim to fulfill this need. One of these products is collective. plonetruegallery, which describes itself as:  A gallery slideshow product for plone that can aggregate from picasa and flickr  or use plone images  http:  pypi.python.org pypi collective. plonetruegallery  .  [ 39 ]   Managing Image Content  This describes it very well. The second gallery product is Products. Slideshowfolder, which is a bit simpler and more lightweight than collective. plonetruegallery. Both products are available as eggs on PyPI.  Creating galleries with collective. plonetruegallery Probably one of the best and most feature-rich gallery products available for Plone is  collective.plonetruegallery.  The most recent version when writing this book was 0.7.1. Some tests  showed that most of the features are implemented. The product works  stably and makes a good overall impression. The product is actively  developed, so some of the features may have changed meanwhile.  collective.plonetruegallery uses jQuery to provide a nice and smooth viewing  experience. Because it is available as an egg on PyPi, it can be included in our buildout  or as a dependency to our policy package. We will use the latter of the two options. We add to the setup.py of the mm.enhance package the following line:  install_requires=[         'setuptools',          -*- Extra requirements: -*-         'p4a.image',         'p4a.ploneimage',        'collective.plonetruegallery',        'gdata',   optional for picasa support         'flickrapi',   optional for flickr support        ],  We add the following snippet to the configure.zcml file of mm.enhance:  <configure     xmlns="http:  namespaces.zope.org zope"     xmlns:five="http:  namespaces.zope.org five"     xmlns:cmf="http:  namespaces.zope.org cmf"     i18n_domain="mm.enhance">                         [ 40 ]   Chapter 2  After doing so, we have to rerun our buildout using the following command:  $ bin buildout Now we need to restart the instance. Installing collective.plonetruegallery  as an add-on product will finally enable the gallery on our site. Unlike the p4a. ploneimage product, the collective.plonetruegallery product provides a  custom content type—gallery. A gallery is a folderish content type, which can be  added anywhere in the site. A gallery may contain images and other galleries.  A gallery cannot be marked as IImageContainerEnhanced. An image  folder is either a gallery OR an image folder. Of course, you can always  have different image folders with different types in your site. If you have  p4a.ploneimage installed, the pictures you add to your gallery will still  be image enhanced.  [ 41 ]   Managing Image Content  When adding a gallery, we can set some options for the gallery. Like any other   Plone content object, a gallery has a title. Additionally, we have to choose a couple   of parameters:   	 Type  required    With collective.plonetruegallery, we can use Plone images as a source  for the gallery or access external databases for feeding it. With the Type  option, we can switch between three styles:  	   	   	   Plone images: With this style standard  or enhanced , Plone  image objects stored in the gallery container are the source for  the gallery. Flickr: This option allows us to utilize a Flickr account to  present a photo album stored at the image site. Picasa: Like Flickr, there are no pictures stored in the Plone  database but they can be accessed from an external provider.  Only the source differs, which is Google's Picasa in this case.   	 Size  Small, Medium, and Large   We have three options for choosing the image size for our gallery view:  small, medium, and large. These options correspond with the following   image scales of Plone: mini  200x200 pixels , preview  400x400 pixels ,   and large  768x768 pixels . The default value is medium.   	 Gallery display type  classic, slideshow   We can choose how the gallery is displayed. While the classic view is quite  simple and only supports simple fading of images, the slideshow is quite  fancy and supports some more transition effects. We can configure it in the  Advanced section of the gallery edit page. The default value is classic for  this option.  [ 42 ]   Advanced settings for the gallery In the advanced section, we find some more options to fine-tune the behavior of  our gallery.  Chapter 2   	 Show Carousel?   	 Show Info pane?   	 Timed?  Shows the thumbnails of the current and the next five pictures at the top of  the screen.  Shows information about the picture at the bottom of the content area.  Changes pictures automatically if this feature is enabled.  [ 43 ]   Managing Image Content   	 Delay  required   Delay for changing pictures in milliseconds if Timed option is enabled.   	 Change Duration  required    	 Transition  Fade, Show   The amount of time the effects take in milliseconds when changing the image.  The transition used for fading in the image. The transition option is only used  for the classic gallery type. We have two choices here:  	  	   Fade: Fade to the next image with the parameters set above. Show: Show the next image with a non-fade transition.   	 Slideshow Effect  Flash, Fold, Ken Burns, Push, and None   The optical effect used for transition. This option is only available for the  "Slideshow" variant of display. For some examples of the single effects, you  may have a look at the home page of the slideshow JavaScript library  see  http:  www.electricprism.com aeron slideshow  .  All these values can be set when creating the gallery, but can be changed at any   time later.  Accessing Flickr To access Flickr, we first need to include the flickrapi  http:  pypi.python.org  pypi flickrapi  library in our instance. We also need a username and the name  of the set where the photos are placed. There is a special tab called Flickr for setting  these options:  [ 44 ]   Chapter 2  Accessing Picasa To access a photo album stored at Picasa, we need an additional egg containing the  API for accessing the service. It is called gdata and is available on PyPI  http:   pypi.python.org pypi gdata . What we need to do is select picasa: A Gallery  That Uses a Picasa Web Album For its Images as the gallery type. Then we have to  set some parameters for accessing the gallery. We need a Google account if we want  to access private albums.  If it is a public album, we just need to specify the name of the album in the  designated field of the Picasa tab. For a private album, we need to enter our  credentials and tell the gallery that we want to access a private gallery.  [ 45 ]   Managing Image Content Accessing external services If we choose an external service, all other options and parameters for the gallery are  the same as with the standard Plone image type.  Adding content to external galleries You can still add images and subgalleries to the gallery, but they won't  have any affect on the display if you choose to fetch the pictures from an  external source.  If we decide to use one or the other option to access the image data from internal or  external sources, we have to be aware of some facts. Here are some pro and cons listed:   Using external services has some advantages:   	 They save storage space on your machines  	 They save network bandwidth  These are some disadvantages:   	 They depend on uptime of the external provider  	 There is almost no  security  control over the images  The Slideshowfolder product An alternative product to collective.plonetruegallery is Products. slideshowfolder  http:  pypi.python.org pypi Products.slideshowfolder .  Like the previously shown collective.plonetruegallery package the actual  JavaScript code presenting the images is based on the Slideshow 2 library written by  Aeron Glemann. One advantage is the lack of a proprietary content type. This means  that we can turn any normal folder and even collections into a slideshow at any time.  After installing the package, we will find an additional action on folderish objects.  [ 46 ]   Chapter 2  Enabling this feature will give us a slideshow loop right away. There is a view  provided in the product that allows us to change the settings of the slideshow.  As it uses the same backend, the options are similar to those of the collective. plonetruegallery though not all of them are exposed. Unfortunately, this view is  not exposed as an action. Let's do so by adding the following XML as a actions.xml  file to the GenericSetup profile of our multimedia policy product:    <object name="portal_actions" meta_type="Plone Actions Tool"    xmlns:i18n="http:  xml.zope.org namespaces i18n">            Configure slideshow           <property       name="url_expr">string:${object_url} @@slideshow-settings            <property       name="available_expr">object @@folder_slideshow_view  isSlideshow                      True            [ 47 ]   Managing Image Content  This configuration file will add an action named configureSlideshow to the  object_buttons category. This action will only be available in the case that a folder  is a slideshowfolder.  Choosing a slideshow product Which of the two presented gallery products is good for my use case? You should use Products.slideshowfolder if either of these facts is true for you:  I want a quick solution and don't want to configure anything. I have many folders collections with existing images.  You should use collective.plonetruegallery if any of these facts is true for you:  I want all the fancy stuff and want to configure as much as possible. I want to organize my pictures in a deeper structure. I have galleries   and subgalleries. I want to include pictures from an external service such as Picasa   or Flickr. I have another external image provider that I want to use with the   gallery product.  You always can mix both packages in one site. You can have some folders  slideshowfolder enhanced and others created as galleries.   	  	   	  	   	   	  Manipulating Images We will do some programming at the end of this chapter, where we will utilize PIL  to do an on-the-fly image manipulation. But before we go on, we should make one  thing clear: Plone is not image manipulation software. If you want sophisticated  image manipulation, use Photoshop  http:  www.adobe.com de products  photoshop photoshop   or GIMP  http:  www.gimp.org  . These applications will  give you the full power of image manipulation possibilities. Nevertheless, Plone has  some limited features for standard image manipulation and can be easily enhanced  with at least everything that PIL provides. Some of these operations are already  exposed in the Transform tab as we have seen at the beginning of this chapter. Now let's see an example. We assume that we want to protect an image with a  watermark. Therefore, we write a view that renders the protected image. The image  itself should not be touched in any way. All operations should be handled on the fly  when calling the view.  [ 48 ]   Chapter 2  First, we register the BrowserView with ZCML:  <browser:page       for="p4a.image.interfaces.IImageEnhanced"       name="watermark"       class=".watermark.WatermarkView"       permission="zope2.View"        >  We define a view with the name watermark for enhanced images. These images  are marked with the p4a.image.interfaces.IImageEnhanced interface. We  allow everyone with view permission to see the view. The code for our view is in  the watermark module and the view class is called WatermarkView. We don't have  a template here, as we just want to render an image. This image may be used in  different contexts.   Next, we add the code to the view class:  from Products.Five import BrowserView  For defining view classes for Zope2, we need to inherit from Five's BrowserView.  Technically speaking, a BrowserView is a multi-adapter of a context and the request.  The BrowserView class is originally defined in zope.publisher.browser. Five just  adds an acquisition wrapper to it.  class WatermarkView BrowserView :      def __call__ self :  First, we set some commonly used variables. We get the image field from our context  and save it to "image". Now we load the watermark image included in the product  and set the value of opacity, which is used for the inclusion. This value can be set  between zero and one.          image = self.context.getImage           mark_data = open join dirname __file__ ,                      'watermark.png' , 'rb' .read           opacity = 0.5  Next, we generate a PIL image from our original image and the watermark. If there  is no alpha channel included in the image, we include one.  pil_img = PILImage.open StringIO str image.data            original_format = pil_img.format         if pil_img.mode != 'RGBA':             pil_img = pil_img.convert 'RGBA'           pil_mark = PILImage.open StringIO mark_data    [ 49 ]   Managing Image Content          if pil_mark.mode != 'RGBA':             pil_mark = pil_mark.convert 'RGBA'           pm = pil_mark.copy           alpha = pm.split  [3]         alpha = PILImageEnhance.Brightness alpha .enhance opacity          pil_mark.putalpha alpha   Now we create a new layer and resize it to the dimensions of our original image.          layer = PILImage.new 'RGBA', pil_img.size,  0,0,0,0            scale, but preserve the aspect ratio         ratio = min  float pil_img.size[0]    pil_mark.size[0],                      float pil_img.size[1]    pil_mark.size[1]                              w = int pil_mark.size[0] * ratio          h = int pil_mark.size[1] * ratio          pil_mark = pil_mark.resize  w, h           layer.paste pil_mark,                        pil_img.size[0] - w    2,                       pil_img.size[1] - h    2    Finally, we put it all together. We create a new file with StringIO and save the  converted data to this file-like object.  out_file = StringIO           composite = PILImage.composite layer, pil_img, layer          format = original_format or 'JPEG'         composite.save out_file, format          out_file.reset    We need to set some request header variables to let the browser know the type of  content it's fetching. These values include the MIME type of the image, its name, and  its binary size.          response = self.request.response         response.setHeader 'Content-type',                             'image %s' % format .lower            response.setHeader 'Content-Disposition',                            'inline;filename=%s' % image.filename          response.setHeader 'Content-Length',                              len self.context.getSize             return out_file.getvalue    [ 50 ]   That's it. Now we can add watermark to the URL of every p4a-enhanced image and  get a watermarked image as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 2  We are now free to protect the display of the original image with a view, or by  restricting permission. This is left to the reader as an exercise.  Summary In this chapter we saw how we can add images to Plone and organize them in folders  with a nice thumbnail view, and how to access them within the site. We investigated  the p4a.ploneimage product, which is made to enhance the Plone image-processing  features by adding some extra metadata and a marker interface for hooking in views  and other components. In addition, we took a detailed look at two gallery products   collective.plonetruegallery and Products.slideshowfolder . Finally, we  saw an example of how to use the image manipulation features of PIL with image  data stored in Plone.  [ 51 ]    Managing Audio Content  Another type of multimedia content besides images is audio. There are at least   four use cases when we think of integrating audio in a web application:   1.  We want to provide an audio database with static files for download. 2.  We have audio that we want to have streamed to the Internet     for example, as a podcast .  3.  We want a audio file live show streamed to the Internet as an Internet    radio service.  4.  We want some sound to be played when the site is loaded or shown.  In this chapter we will discuss three of the four cases. The streaming support is  limited to use case 2. We can stream to one client like a podcast does, but not to  many clients at once like an Internet Radio does. We need special software such   as Icecast or SHOUTcast for this purpose. Further, we will investigate how we   solve use cases 1, 2, and 3 with the Plone CMS and extensions.  These are the topics covered in this chapter:   	 Manipulation of audio content stored as File content in Plone  	 The different formats used for the binary storage of audio data  	 Storing and accessing MP3 audio metadata with the ID3 tag format  	 Managing metadata, formats, and playlists with p4a.ploneaudio in Plone  	  	 Using the Flowplayer product to include an audio player standalone in rich   Including a custom embedded audio player in Plone  text and as a portlet   	 Previewing the audio element of HTML5  	 Extracting metadata from a FLAC file using mutagen   Managing Audio Content  Uploading audio files with an unmodified  Plone installation The out of the box support of Plone for audio content is limited. What is possible to  do is to upload an audio file utilizing the File content type of Plone to the ZODB. A  File is nothing more and nothing less than a simple binary file. Plone does not make  any difference between a MP3 file and a ZIP, an EXE, or an RPM binary file.  When adding File content to Plone, we need to upload a file  of course! . We don't  necessarily need to specify a title, as the filename is used if the title is omitted. The  filename is always taken for the short name  ID  of the object. This limits the number  of files with any specific name to one in a container.  While uploading a file, Plone tries to recognize the MIME type and the size of the  file. This is the smallest subset of information shared by all binary files the content  type File was intended for. Normally, detecting the MIME type for standard audio  is not a problem if the file extension is correctly set.  Clicking on the link in the default view either downloads the file or opens it with  the favorite player of your operating system. This behavior depends on the settings  made on the target browser and corresponds with the method 1 of our audio use  cases. It goes without saying that we can add the default metadata to files and  organize them in folders.  Like Images, File objects do not have a workflow associated in a default Plone setup.  They inherit the read and write permissions from the container they are placed into.  Still, we can add an existing workflow to this content type or create a new one via the  portal_workflow tool if we want.  [ 54 ]   Chapter 3  That's pretty much it. Fortunately, we can utilize some extensions to enhance the  Plone audio story greatly.  What we will see in this chapter is as follows: First, we will go over some theoretical  ground. We will see what formats are available for storing audio content and   which is best for which purpose. Later we will investigate the Plone4Artists   extension for Plone's File content type—p4a.ploneaudio. We will talk about  metadata especially used for audio content and how to manipulate it. As a concrete  example, we will use mutagen to extract metadata from a FLAC file to add FLAC  support to p4a.ploneaudio. Finally, we will have a word on streaming audio data  through the Web and see how to embed a Flash player into our Plone site. We will   see how we can do this programmatically and also with the help of a third-party  product called collective.flowplayer. At the very end of the chapter, we have  a small technical preview on HTML5 where a dedicated audio element is available.  This element allows us to embed audio directly into our HTML page without the  detour with Flash.  Accessing audio content in Plone Once we upload a file we want to work with to Plone, we will link it with other content and display it in one way or another.  There are several ways of accessing  audio data in Plone. It can be accessed in the visual editor by editors, in templates   by integrators and in Python code by developers.  Kupu access Unlike for images, there is no special option in the visual editor to embed file audio  content into a page. The only way to access an audio file with Kupu is to use an  internal link. The file displays as a normal link and is executed when clicked.   Executed means  as for the standalone file  saved or opened with the music player   of your operating system as is done in the standard view of the File content type.  Of course, it is possible to reference external audio files as well.  Page template access As there is no special access method in Kupu, there is none in page templates. If we  need to access a file there, we can use the absolute_url method of the audio content  object. This computes a link we can refer to. So the only way to access a file from  another context is to refer to its URL.  <a tal:attributes="href audiocontext absolute_url"    tal:content="audiocontext Title">audio   [ 55 ]   Managing Audio Content Python script access If we need to access the content of an  audio  file in a Python script, we can get the  binary data with the Archetype accessor getFile.  >>> binary = context.getFile    This method returns the data wrapped into a Zope OFS.File object. To access the  raw data as a string, we need to do the following:  >>> rawdata = str binary.data   Accessing the raw data of an audio file might be useful if we want to do format  transformations on the fly or other direct manipulation of the data.  Field access If we write our own content type and want to save audio data with an object, we  need a file field. This field stores the binary data and takes care of communicating  with the browser with adequate view and edit widgets. The file field is defined  in the Field module of the Archetype product. Additional to the properties, it  exclusively defines that it inherits from the ObjectField base class. The following  properties are important.  Key type default primary widget content_class default_content_type  Default value 'file' ' ' False FileWidget File 'application octet-stream'  The type property provides a unique name for the field. We usually don't need  to change this. The default property defines the default value for this field. It  is normally empty. If we want to change it, we need to specify an instance of the  content_class property. One field of the schema can be marked as primary. This field can be retrieved by the  getPrimaryField accessor. When accessing the content object with FTP, the content  of the primary field is transmitted to the client. Like every other field, the file field needs a widget. The standard FileWidget is  defined in the Widget module of the Archetypes product.  [ 56 ]   Chapter 3  The content_class property declares the instance, where the actual binary data  is stored. As standard, the File class from Zope's OFS.Image module is used. This  class supports chunk-wise transmission of the data with the publisher. Field can be accessed like any other field by its accessor method. This method is  either defined as a property of the field or constructed from its name. If the name  were "audio", the accessor would be getAudio. The accessor is generated from the  "get" prefix with the capitalized name of the field.  Audio formats Before we go on with Plone and see how we can enhance the story of audio  processing and manipulate audio data, we will glance at audio formats. We will see  how raw audio data is compressed to enable effective audio storage and streaming.  We need to have some basic audio know-how about some of the terminology to  understand how we can effectively process audio for our own purposes.  As with images, there are several formats in which audio content can be stored.   We want to learn a bit of theoretical background. This eases the decision of   choosing the right format for our use case.  An analog acoustic signal can be displayed as a wave:     [ 57 ]   Managing Audio Content  If digitalized, the wave gets approximated by small rectangles below the curve. The  more rectangles are used the better is the sound  fidelity  of the digital variant. The  width of the rectangles is called the sampling rate. Usual sampling rates include:   	  	  	  	  	  44.1 kHz  44,100 samples per second : CD quality 32 kHz: Speech 14.5 kHz: FM radio bandwidth 10 kHz: AM radio 8 kHz: Telephone speech  Each sample is stored with a fixed number of bits. This value is called the audio bit  depth or bit resolution. Finally, there is a third value that we already know from the analog side. It is the  channel. We have one channel for mono and two channels for stereo. For the digital  variant, this means a doubling of data if stereo is used.  So let's do a calculation. Let's assume we have an audio podcast with a length  of eight minutes, which we want to stream in stereo CD quality. The sampling  rate corresponds with the highest frequency of sound that is stored. For accurate  reproduction of the original sound, the sample rate has to be at least twice that of  the highest frequency sound. Most humans cannot hear frequencies higher than 20  kHz. The corresponding sampling rate to 20 kHz is a sampling rate of 44100 samples.  We want to use a bit resolution of 16. This is the standard bit depth for audio CDs.  Lastly, we have two channels for stereo:  44100 x 16 x 2 x 60 x 8= 677376000 bits = 84672000 bytes ≈ 80.7 MB  This is quite a lot of data for eight minutes of CD-quality sound. We do not want to  store so much data and more importantly, we do not want to send so much data over  the Internet. So what we do is compress the data. Zipping the data would not give us  a big effect because of the binary structure of digital audio data. There are different  types of compressions for different types of data. ZIPs are good for text, JPEG is good  for images, and MP3 is good for music—but why? Each of these algorithms takes  the nature of the data into account. ZIP looks for redundant characters, JPEG unifies  similar color areas, and MP3 strips the frequencies humans do not hear from the   raw data.  [ 58 ]   Chapter 3  Audio compression algorithms are called codecs. There are two kinds of these  codecs—lossless codecs and lossy codecs. We don't want to go into further details  here. All we need to know is that lossless codecs don't lose data  quality  when they  compress. Lossy codecs compress better but loose data. Thus if we convert a raw  stream to a lossy format  such as MP3 or Ogg Vorbis , converting it back to raw, and  back again to MP3, the output will differ from the first one. Usually, one won't hear  the difference between a raw file and a lossy-encoded one after a single encoding  pass, but there is some recognizable quality loss after multiple passes. If we do the  same with a lossless codec, the output stays the same no matter how often we encode  and decode.  Some commonly used audio codecs are:   	 Lossy: MP3, Ogg Vorbis, Musepack, WMA, and AAC  	 Lossless: FLAC, WavPack, Monkey's Audio, and ALAC Apple Lossless  	 Raw: WAV and AIFF  Choosing the right audio format You may ask the question: There are so many formats, which one shall I use?   If you have a choice, which may not always be the case, you can rely on some   short guidelines:  Format MP3  Ogg Vorbis  FLAC  Other formats  Decision guidelines You want to reach as many people as possible. You want your audio content to be playable with almost all  mobile players. Your audio may be used together with Flash; MP3 is easily  embedded there. You want a format that is easily streamable. You want small file sizes for storing and streaming. You want most of the advantages of MP3. You want a patent-free format  this can be helpful if you plan  to use HTML5 . You have high-quality audio content. You have big disk space. You and your users don't care about Internet bandwidth. You have a special reason to do so  for example, if your users  stick to iTunes, you may probably use AAC .  [ 59 ]   Managing Audio Content  Converting audio formats Sometimes we need to convert one audio format to another. Most web audio players  understand only a few formats. Often, they are limited to MP3 only. If we want to  play our audio—available in the Ogg Vorbis format—with such players, we have  to convert it first. We will see how to do that in this section. If you work a lot with  multimedia, you probably know the VLC player from VideoLAN. VLC is a media  player and server. It is available on most platforms, including Windows, Mac OS X,  and Linux. If VLC doesn't support the format you need, check the home page of the  audio format.  Many audio players support the encoding of audio too. On Windows, the popular  audio player Winamp can be used to convert audio formats. On Linux, you probably  want to try Amarok. Amarok is a player for KDE and its plugins are scriptable with  Python. There are ready available plugins for converting audio data.  Sometimes it is not possible to convert directly. This makes it necessary to convert to  raw audio  WAV  first, and then convert it to the desired target format.  Converting audio with VLC If we use the VLC player for converting audio files, we are utilizing the streaming  mode of the player. We open the Streaming Export Wizard... from the File menu.  There we choose the second option Transcode Save to file in the dialog box. Next,  we select a file available in the playlist of the player or from the hard disk. After  doing so, we select the target format. As stated before most players support MP3,  so MP3 might be good choice. If the raw format is needed, we have to choose  Uncompressed, integer. On the next screen, we have to pick the encapsulation  format. If we have selected MP3 before, RAW is a good choice here because we are  able to read and manipulate the created file with most audio editing software  for  example. Audacity . If we have selected Uncompressed, integer in the earlier step,  we don't have a choice now as WAV is the only supported encapsulation format in  this case. As the last step we choose a filename for the file, which is created with the  new format.  After confirming the summary, we are ready and have a new item in our VLC  playlist: Streaming Transcoding Wizard  1 1 . We need to "play" this item to make  the actual transcoding happen. The process might take some time depending on the  source and target format. We don't hear anything during the transcoding process. In  the case of success, there is a new file on our hard disk that we can test with VLC and  then use with our favorite web player in Plone.  [ 60 ]   Chapter 3  Audio metadata As for most digital photo formats, it is also possible for most audio formats to store  some additional data on the binary file. This data contains information on the artist,  the album, the genre, the encoding itself, and some more information.  ID3 tag: The metadata format for MP3 The ID3 tag is the metadata format for MP3. ID3 stands for Identify an MP3. Before  it was introduced, the only chance of storing metadata was in the filename, which  tended to get very long. The ID3v1tag is capable of storing this information:  Offset 0 3 33 63 93 97 127  Length 3 30 30 30 4 30 1  Description "TAG" Identifier Song title Artist Album A four-digit year Comment Genre  There have been some revisions in the format. Nowadays, ID3v2 tags are commonly  used. The ID3v2 tag is a complete rewrite of the original ID3 tag implementation.  The format is capable of storing icons of the cover art, supports character encoding,  and the stored information is not limited to a few characters. The maximum for  storing metadata on MP3 with the ID3v2 tag is 256 megabytes. This is enough space  for storing karaoke lyrics in several languages.  Metadata of other audio formats Most other audio formats support storing metadata information on the file as  well. The Ogg Vorbis metadata is called Vorbis comments. They support metadata  tags similar to those implemented in the ID3 tag standard for MP3. Music tags  are typically implemented as strings of the [TAG]=[VALUE] form  for example,  "ARTIST=The Rolling Stones" .  Like the current version of the ID3 tag, users and encoding software are free to use  whichever tags are appropriate for the content.  [ 61 ]   Managing Audio Content  FLAC defines several types of metadata blocks. One of these blocks is favored.  It is the only mandatory STREAMINFO block. This block stores audio-centric  information such as the sample rate, the number of channels, and so on. Also  included in the STREAMINFO block is the MD5 signature of the unencoded   audio data. This is useful for checking an entire stream for transmission errors.  Metadata blocks can be any length and new ones can be defined. A decoder is  allowed to skip any metadata types it does not understand.  Editing audio metadata Let's see how the metadata comes into the audio. Most CD encoding programs  query an open metadata database such as freedb to generate the metadata for our  audio content automatically. If we have MP3 files that are not encoded on their own,  we need a tag editor. Almost every modern player supports accessing the ID3 tag  information nowadays. If you have a Mac, you can use iTunes to manipulate the ID3  tag information of every track. Use command for accessing the metadata window.  On Windows and Linux there is a product called EasyTAG  http:  easytag. sourceforge.net  , which allows you to manage the metadata of your audio files  for whole directories. You can use this software on the Mac too, if you have MacPorts.  EasyTAG also supports writing the Ogg Vorbis and FLAC metadata.  There are other options. Check the manuals of your favorite audio player. Very  likely, it comes with some support of reading and writing metadata.  Now we are perfectly prepared to manage our content with Plone: We chose a  compression format for our data. We structured the data with additional metadata.  What we want is to take this effort into Plone. A simple File content type is not  sufficient any longer. We will investigate an extension in the next section, which   aims to solve this issue.  [ 62 ]   Chapter 3  Audio enhancements with   p4a.ploneaudio One of the most advanced products to boost the audio features of Plone is p4a. ploneaudio. Like its image sister p4a.ploneimage it doesn't bring a content type  on its own, but expands existing ones. As you might have guessed already, the File  content type and the folderish ones  Folder, Large Folder, and Collection  are chosen  for the enhancement.  To install it, add the following code to the buildout of our instance:  [buildout] ...  [instance] ... eggs =     ${buildout:eggs}     Plone     p4a.ploneaudio zcml =     p4a.ploneaudio  After running the buildout and restarting the instance, we need to install   the product as an add-on product. We find it with the product name   Plone4Artists Audio  p4a.ploneaudio .  Enhancing files Installing the p4a.ploneaudio product enables the enhancement of the File content  type of ATContentTypes. Unlike with the image enhancement, not all files are  automatically enhanced with additional audio features. p4a.ploneaudio comes  with a MIME type filter. If we upload a file with one of the meta types such as audio  MPEG or application Ogg, the file will automatically be audio enhanced. All other  files  such as ZIP files, EXE files, and so on  stay untouched.  Technically speaking, this works via a named adapter.  [ 63 ]   Managing Audio Content  The first thing we see is the modified default view for audio-enhanced files:  [ 64 ]   Chapter 3  On the right side we see some technical information about the audio file itself. We  find the size, the format  MP3 or Ogg , the bitrate, the frequency, and the length of  the track there. As with any other content type, we have the title and the description  at the top of the content area. For the audio-enhanced content, the description  has changed from a simple text field to a rich text field. We find four buttons after  the usual CMS bar  the belowcontenttitle slot  containing the author and the  modification date of the file. Each of these buttons retrieves the audio file in a  different way:  Button  Action Play  Pop up  Stream  Download  Description An embedded audio player written in Flash.  Clicking on it starts playback immediately. Opens a pop-up window with a Flash player  playing the audio track. This is useful if  someone wants to play the track while  continuing to browse the site. Clicking on the button returns an M3U  playlist with the URL of the file. The browser  operating system needs to take care of the  handling of the stream. If you have a Mac, the  file will be streamed to iTunes. This is the standard behavior of Plone's File  content type. The file is returned to the client  like any other file object. It can be saved or  opened with the favorite media player of the  operating system.  We find a long list of additional information on the audio track below the player and  streaming buttons. This information is the metadata stored with the audio file and is  gathered during the enhancing process. It can be changed and written back to the file.  Let's take a closer look on the enhancement process.  One important step here is marking the content object with two interfaces:   	 One is p4a.subtyper.interfaces.ISubtyped. This interface marks   the content as subtyped.    	 The other interface is p4a.audio.interfaces.IAudioEnhanced. This  interface describes the type of enhancement, which is audio content in   this case.  All other views and components available with the enhanced version bind to the  p4a.audio.interfaces.IAudioEnhanced interface.  [ 65 ]   Managing Audio Content  Additionally, p4a.ploneaudio tries to extract as much of the metadata information  from the file as possible.  The title is retrieved from the metadata and changed.  Let's see what happens when a file is added in detail:  It is possible to write custom audio enhancers if needed. The enhancers are queried  as named adapters by the MIME type on the IAudioDataAccessor interface.  [ 66 ]   Chapter 3  Enhancing containers With p4a.ploneaudio, we can turn any Plone folder into an audio-enhanced folder  by choosing Audio container from the Subtype menu. Two marker interfaces are attached to the container:  p4a.subtyper.interfaces.ISubtyped  p4a.audio.interfaces.IAudioContainerEnhanced  The default view of the container is changed utilizing the  IAudioContainerEnhanced interface. The new default view is  audio-container.html, which comes with the p4a.ploneaudio product.  [ 67 ]   Managing Audio Content  In the View option we see one box for each track. For each track, the title and the cover  artwork is shown. There is also an embedded Flash player to play each track directly.  There are some other container views that come with the product as follows:   	 audio-album.html  album view   	 audiocd-popup.html  pop-up view   	 cd_playlist.xspf  And the default edit view for IAudioContainerEnhaced-marked folders  is overridden. The audio-album.html view presents the audio content of the container in a slightly  different way. The single tracks are arranged in a table. Two variants of this view  are exposed in the Display menu of the container—Album view and Album view  with no track numbers. Both these views are more compact than the default audio  container view and have the same layout, except that the second one omits the  column with the track numbers. As for the other audio container views, there is a  player for each track. Moreover, there are two buttons on the top of the page. One   and the other one is the familiar pop-up player  is the commonly used RSS icon  button  By clicking on the RSS icon, we get to the stream  or podcast of the folder . This may  not be too interesting for a standard static Folder, but can be for a Collection where  the content changes more dynamically.   .  The pop-up player for a folder looks and operates slightly differently as the file  standalone variant. It contains all tracks that are part of the audio container as   a playlist. Lastly, there is the cd_playlist.xspf view. This view is not exposed via a display  or as an action. It provides the audio data as a XSPF stream.  The XML Shareable Playlist Format: XSPF The XML Shareable Playlist Format  XSPF  is an XML file format for storing  playlists of digital audio. The audio can be located locally or online. Last.fm   uses XSPF for providing its playlists. An example playlist looks like this:                       example.mp3   [ 68 ]   Chapter 3         Tom         Thriller         A comment                     another.mp3         Tom               There is a list of applications supporting the XSPF format on the XSPF    http:  xspf.org   website. The default XSPF view of p4a.ploneaudio does not include all possible information.  It provides the following attributes:   	 location: This is the required location  URL  of the song.  	 image: The album artwork that may be included with each track.  	 annotation: p4a.ploneaudio collects information about the title, artist,   album, and year in this field.  It is easy to write a custom implementation of an XSPF view. Look at the available  fields at the XSPF home page and the XSPF implementation of p4a.audio. We find  the template named cd_playlist.xspf.pt in the p4a.audio.browser module.  p4a.ploneaudio and the Plone catalog Besides the customized default views and the additional views, p4a.ploneaudio  comes with a number of other changes. One very important change is the disclosure  of some audio metadata fields to the portal catalog. This allows us to use them in  catalog queries in general and smart folders in particular.  The following indexes are added:    	 Artist  	 Genre  	 Track  	 Format  The "Artist" attribute is exposed as metadata information in the catalog. Also, the  genre and the artist name are added to the full text index "SearchableText".  [ 69 ]   Managing Audio Content  The values for the genre field are hardcoded. The ID3 tag genre list  is used together with the Winamp extensions. They are stored as a  vocabulary. The term titles are resolved for Searchable Text, but not  for the index and the Collection field.  Accessing audio metadata in Collections To access catalog information in collections, it needs to be exposed to the collections  tool. This can either be done by a product or TTW in the Plone configuration panel.  p4a.ploneaudio comes with a modification of the fields:   	 Artist  Artist name   	 Genre  Genre   	 Format  MIME Types   Let's say we want a collection of all our MP3 files. All we have to do is add a MIME  Types criterion to our collection and set audio mpeg as the value:   [ 70 ]   Chapter 3  ATAudio migration If you have an older Plone site  2.5 , you probably have ATAudio installed to deal  with audio content. ATAudio has features similar to p4a.ploneaudio. This is not  surprising as p4a.ploneaudio was derived from ATAudio. The main difference is  that ATAudio provides a content type, while p4a.ploneaudio reuses an existing one.  If you want to switch from ATAudio to p4a.ploneaudio for one or the other reason,  p4a.ploneaudio comes with a migration routine. One reason for switching might  be that ATAudio is not actively developed any more and probably doesn't work  with recent versions of Plone. For migrating, you need to call migrate-ataudio- configlet.html and follow the instructions there. The migration view is available only if ATAudio is installed. There is a little bit  of a catch-22 situation because p4a.ploneaudio doesn't run on Plone 2.5 and  ATAudio doesn't run on Plone 3. This means there is no good starting point  for the migration. At least, there is a version of ATAudio that does install in  Plone 3 in the collective repository:  http:  svn.plone.org svn collective ATAudio tags 0.7- plone3migration .  Extracting metadata with  AudioDataAccessors The IAudioDataAccessor interface is used for extracting metadata from binary  audio content. If uploading a file, Plone tries to acquire a named adapter for the  interface with the MIME type as the key. It has the following layout:  class IAudioDataAccessor interface.Interface :             """Audio implementation accessor  ie MP3, ogg, etc .             """     audio_type = schema.TextLine title=_ u'Audio Type' ,                                  required=True,                                              readonly=True      def load filename :         """Load from filename"""      def store filename :         """Store to filename"""  The audio_type field contains a human-readable description of the audio type. In  the case of MP3, the Unicode string "MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3" is used. The load and  store methods are used for reading writing the metadata from to the audio file.  [ 71 ]   Managing Audio Content  The definition for the MP3 adapter looks like this:  <adapter     for="p4a.audio.interfaces.IPossibleAudio"                factory="._audiodata.MP3AudioDataAccessor"            provides="p4a.audio.interfaces.IAudioDataAccessor"     name="audio mpeg"      >  The component is registered for the p4a.audio.interfaces.IPossibleAudio  interface. All classes marked with this interface are capable of getting converted to an  audio-enhanced object. The standard product marks the File content type with this  interface. The adapter provides the p4a.audio.interfaces.IAudioDataAccessor  interface, which is the marker for the lookup. The name attribute of adapter is the  key for the lookup and needs to be set to the MIME type of the audio file that should  be processed. Now, the factory does the actual work of loading and storing the metadata from the  audio file.   p4a.ploneaudio and FLAC For the moment, p4a.ploneaudio only supports MP3 and Ogg Vorbis. This is a  reasonable choice. Both formats are streamable and were made for good audio  quality with small file sizes. We want to add FLAC support. We use mutagen for  metadata extraction. Mutagen is an audio metadata extractor written in Python. It is  capable of reading and writing many audio metadata formats including:   	 FLAC  	 M4A  	 Monkey's Audio  	 MP3  	 Musepack  	 Ogg Vorbis  	 True Audio  	 WavPack  	 OptimFROG    For a description of the individual formats, see Appendix A.   Let's remember the flow chart of the audio adding process. We recall that we need a  metadata extractor for our FLAC MIME type.  [ 72 ]   First, we need to register a named adapter for this purpose. This is very similar to the  MP3 adapter we saw before:  Chapter 3  <adapter       for="p4a.audio.interfaces.IPossibleAudio"       factory=".flac._audiodata.FlacAudioDataAccessor"       provides="p4a.audio.interfaces.IAudioDataAccessor"       name="application x-flac"        >  The adapter is used for objects implementing the p4a.audio.interfaces. IPossibleAudio interface. The factory does the work of extracting the metadata.  The adapter provides the p4a.audio.interfaces.IAudioDataAccessor interface.  This is what the adapter is made for and the name is application x-flac, which  is the MIME type of FLAC audio files.  Next, we define the metadata accessor:  from mutagen.flac import Open as openaudio ... from p4a.audio.ogg._audiodata import _safe  First, we need some third-party imports. For the metadata extraction, we use the  FLAC accessor of the mutagen library. _safe is a helper method. It returns the first  element if the given parameter is a list or a tuple, or the element itself.  class FlacAudioDataAccessor object :     """An AudioDataAccessor for FLAC"""      implements IAudioDataAccessor       def __init__ self, context :         self._filecontent = context  The first lines are the boilerplate part. The adapter class implements the interface the  adapter provides. In the constructor, we get the context of the adapter and save it in  the _filecontent variable of the instance.      @property     def audio_type self :         return 'FLAC'     @property     def _audio self :         return IAudio self._filecontent      @property     def _audio_data self :         annotations = IAnnotations self._filecontent          return annotations.get self._audio.ANNO_KEY, None   [ 73 ]   Managing Audio Content  The audio_type property is just for information purposes and required by the  interface. It is displayed in the audio view. The _audio property is a shortcut for  accessing the IAudio adapter for the context. The audio_data property is a shortcut  for accessing the metadata annotated to the context.      def load self, filename :         flacfile = openaudio filename           self._audio_data['title'] = _safe flacfile.get 'title', ''           self._audio_data['artist'] = _safe flacfile.get 'artist', ''           self._audio_data['album'] = _safe flacfile.get 'album', ''           self._audio_data['year'] = _safe flacfile.get 'date', ''           self._audio_data['idtrack'] = _safe flacfile.                                              get 'tracknumber', ''           self._audio_data['genre'] = _safe flacfile.get 'genre', ''           self._audio_data['comment'] = _safe flacfile.                                              get 'description', ''            self._audio_data['bit_rate'] = long flacfile.info.                                              bits_per_sample          self._audio_data['length'] = long flacfile.info.length          self._audio_data['frequency'] = long flacfile.info.                                               sample_rate   The load method is required by the IAudioDataAccessor interface. It fetches  the metadata using the mutagen method from the audio file and stores it as an  annotation on the context.  def store self, filename :         flacfile = openaudio filename           flacfile['title'] = self._audio.title or u''         flacfile['artist'] = self._audio.artist or u''         flacfile['album'] = self._audio.album or u''         flacfile['date'] = self._audio.year or u''         flacfile['tracknumber'] = self._audio.idtrack or u''          flacfile.save     The store method is required by the IAudioDataAccessor interface as well and its  purpose is to write the metadata from the context annotation back to the audio file.  [ 74 ]   Including audio into HTML Generally, we have two options to include a sound file on a HTML page:  Chapter 3   	 Streaming  	 Non streaming  Another option is to simply include a link to the file like this:  <a href="example.mp3" type="audio x-mpeg" title="MP3 audiofile , ...  kB">example.mp3    This is the standard way Plone includes files into the visual editor.  The advantage of this approach is that virtually everyone is able to access the file in  some way. What happens with the file after it has been downloaded depends on the  client browser and how it is configured. The shortcoming of this method is that we  depend on an external player to listen to the audio. Probably one needs to download  the file and start the player manually.  Including audio with plugin elements Another option to spread an audio file is to use the embed element or the object  element. The former looks like this:     The embed element was introduced by Netscape in browser version 2.0. However,  it has not yet made it into the HTML standard, and probably will never do so.  An alternative element to the Netscape variant is the object element that was  introduced by Microsoft. Including an example.mp3 file located in the data folder  looks like this:  <object type="audio x-mpeg" data="data example.mp3" width="200"           height="20">               alt :  example.mp3     Including audio with the embed or the object element assumes that there is a  plugin installed on the client side that can play the multimedia format. In most   cases, we can't tell what the client is equipped with and want a more robust solution.  [ 75 ]   Managing Audio Content  The third way to include audio into your site is Flash. We still need a plugin on the  client side, but Flash is more widespread than audio player plugins. There are a  couple of free audio players written in Flash. An older but easy-to-use Flash player   is EMFF.  A custom view with an embedded audio  player What we do now is to write a custom view for the audio-enhanced File content type  of Plone. We reuse the mm.enhance product we created in the previous chapter and  add the additional code there.  We utilize the p4a.audio.interfaces.IAudioEnhanced interface to register our  view on.  Let's do so:  <browser:page       for="p4a.audio.interfaces.IAudioEnhanced"       name="my-audioplayer-view"       class=".browser.AudioPlayerView"       permission="zope2.View"       template="player.pt"        >  <browser:resourceDirectory       directory="thirdparty emff"       name="emff"        >  The page is named my-audioplayer-view and has the AudioPlayerView view class  in the browser module. Further, we register a thirdparty emff directory where  we can put the Flash resources of the Flash player. Next, we need to create this view  class and add the player.pt template.  [ 76 ]   We fill the template with the HTML code we get from the EMFF code generator:   Chapter 3  Using the EMFF code generator Choose the first option URL to MP3, though it doesn't really matter what  you write into the text field. The value is overridden with the name we  retrieve from our context object. For the HTML version, you can either  choose HTML or XHTML as Plone 3 doesn't output valid XHTML itself.  Nevertheless, XHTML might still be the better option, as it is future proof.  Selecting XHTML closes the param elements inside of the object element.  We can copy this literally into our Zope page template.  <object type="application x-shockwave-flash" data="emff_lila_info.swf"           width="200" height="55">               [ 77 ]   Managing Audio Content  The Plone template is a standard one using the main_template. We copy the  generated code from the bottom of the codegenerator window and put into the main  slot of the template. There are just two changes we make. One is the location of the  Flash file, which is registered as a resource, and the other is the audio file itself,  which is our context.   <html xmlns="http:  www.w3.org 1999 xhtml" xml:lang="en"       lang="en"       i18n:domain="p4a.audio"       metal:use-macro="context main_template macros master">                 <object type="application x-shockwave-flash"                data=" ++resource++emff emff_lila_info.swf" width="200"                 height="55">                       <param name="FlashVars"                value="src=example.mp3&amp;autostart=yes"              tal:attributes="value string:src=${context getId}&amp;                                                  autostart=yes"   >                      Next, we download the necessary Flash code from its website. The player is provided  as a ZIP package with all sources and stuff included. We need to copy the chosen  skin file to the thirdparty emff directory of our mm.enhance product. In our  example we used the emff_lila_info skin.  Using Flowplayer If we want to use an audio Flash player on our site, but don't want to do any coding  and are not satisfied with the one from p4a.ploneaudio, there is an alternative.  It is possible to use the Flowplayer for our audio data. The Flash and JavaScript  application Flowplayer is mainly designed to be a video player, but can be used as  an audio player as well. Unfortunately, the only audio format the player understands  is MP3. So if we have any other format we have to convert it to the MP3 format  first. The Flowplayer is included with the Plone wrapper product collective. flowplayer. At the time of writing, the available version of the wrapper was 3.0b5.  There are four ways in which we can use collective.flowplayer to include the  audio into your site:  1.  As a standalone player for files with the filename extension .mp3  [ 78 ]   2.  As a playlist for folders containing MP3 files 3.  As a portlet 4.   Inline in any page supporting Rich Text  HTML   The product itself can easily be added to our Plone setup by adding the following  configuration lines to the instance in our buildout.cfg:  Chapter 3  [instance]  ...  eggs =     ...     collective.flowplayer  zcml =     ...     collective.flowplayer  After rerunning the buildout, restarting the instance, and installing Flowplayer  via Plone's add-on products, we are ready to go.  Standalone Flowplayer for audio files The most straightforward way to include the Flowplayer is to use the enhancing  feature of the File content type. If we upload a file with an .mp3 extension, the  file is recognized as a supported audio file. It is marked with the collective. flowplayer.interfaces.IAudio interface and the default view is changed to  Flowplayer. This view comes with collective.flowplayer and embeds a  minimal Flowplayer instance into the page.  [ 79 ]   Managing Audio Content  Combining p4a.ploneaudio and Flowplayer If you have both the p4a.ploneaudio and collective.flowplayer  products installed and you upload a file, it will get the default view of  Flowplayer. The p4a.audio.interfaces.IAudioEnhanced interface  still marks the file. Custom views binding on that interface will still work.  For example you will still be able to access the customskin view you  wrote binding on IAudioEnhanced. Calling the view view accesses the  p4a.ploneaudio default view.  It is not necessary to store the audio files in the Plone site itself. With collective. flowplayer installed, Plone recognizes Link content objects pointing to audio  data. If a URL ends with .mp3, Plone will change the default view to flowplayer  accordingly. From the UI perspective, there is no difference. The only difference  is the source of the audio file. While it is stored in the ZODB in the first case, it is  fetched through a URL in the other case.  Playlist Flowplayer for audio containers If we have folders or collections containing files with the .mp3 extension or links  pointing to MP3 files directly, we can provide a flowplayer view. All we have to do  is to call the flowplayer view on the container. Alternatively, the flowplayer view  can be chosen as default view for a container. The player looks the same as for single  media, including two buttons between the play pause button and the timeslide.  These two buttons provide skip to the next previous track functions.  Audio Flowplayer as a portlet We can expose the Flowplayer as a portlet. All we need is a file or a container, as  described before, as a data provider. We add the portlet as a Video player portlet in  the manage-portlets view at the desired location in our site.  Inline audio player with Flowplayer One killer feature of collective.flowplayer is the integration of the player applet  in normal pages. With the simple addition of a certain CSS class, every link to an  MP3 file can be turned into a Flowplayer. The code for doing this is here:                This text is replaced.    [ 80 ]   Chapter 3  If we only need a play button, the code will look like this:                This text is replaced.     For the integration of the Flowplayer in rich text, there is a shortcut in Kupu. We  need to create a link pointing to an MP3 file in a separate paragraph. It doesn't matter  if this link is internal or external. Then we choose one of Audio, Audio  left  or  Audio  right  as the paragraph style.  To get an inline playlist, the following code is required:       Audio one            Audio two            The documentation of the product suggests that the div element can be extended  with the random option to get a randomized playlist.  Configuring Flowplayer Look at the Flowplayer section in Chapter 4, Managing Video Content  to get details about additional configuration, to get a detailed list  of Flowplayer properties, and to know how to remove Flowplayer  properly from a site.  Technology preview: HTML5 Let's peek into HTML5. HTML5 is the successor of HTML4. It supports the inclusion  of audio and video without using Flash. There is a dedicated audio element for  audio content. This element supports the following attributes:  Attribute autobuffer  Value autobuffer  autoplay  autoplay  controls  controls  src  URL  Description If present, the audio will be loaded at page load and  will be ready to run. autobuffer has no effect if  autoplay is present. If present, the audio will start playing as soon as it  is ready.  If present, the user is shown some controls, such as  a play button. Defines the URL of the audio to play start  [ 81 ]   Managing Audio Content  A player view with HTML5 Writing a player view with HTML5 is extremely easy with the audio element.  Let's assume we have the following page definition in ZCML:  <browser:page       for="p4a.audio.interfaces.IAudioEnhanced"       name="newtechplayer"       permission="zope2.View"       template="html5player.pt"        >  The html5player.pt page template contains only one element:  <div metal:fill-slot="main"      tal:define="audio_info context @@audio_view">    -            <audio controls="controls"           tal:attributes="src context absolute_url">An audio player                   Browser support for HTML5 The described method works only with selected  preview  versions of  current web browsers. When tested, the best results were with Safari  4 and Firefox 3.5. Opera 10 beta and Internet Explorer 8 don't seem to  understand the audio element at all. And there is another limitation:  Different browsers play different audio formats. While Firefox plays only  the open codecs WAV, Ogg Vorbis and Ogg Theora; Safari seems to be  limited to MP3. Bear this in mind when experimenting with HTML5.  [ 82 ]   Chapter 3  Summary In this chapter we saw how to include audio content into Plone. We saw how the  File content type can be used to store audio data in Plone and how the data can  be fetched from it. Additionally, we investigated the storage and the compression  of audio data in general. We learned about different audio formats, and their  advantages and disadvantages if using them in the web context.  Next we saw how we can enhance the audio features of Plone with the Plone4Artists  product p4a.ploneaudio. We investigated the enhancement of single audio files,  containers, and collections of audio files.  We learned how to include audio data in HTML with plugins and Flash. We wrote  a simple player for our audio data and tried Flowplayer as an alternative player.  Finally, we did a small preview on HTML5 where playing audio files is a core  component of the Hypertext Markup Language.  [ 83 ]    Managing Video Content  Nowadays, video is the one of the most important types of Internet content if we  measure the bandwidth taken. Approximately one third of all consumer Internet  traffic is video data according to a Cisco  http:  www.cisco.com en US  solutions collateral ns341 ns525 ns537 ns705 ns827 white_paper_c11- 481360_ns827_Networking_Solutions_White_Paper.html  systems analysis. This  number doesn't take P2P traffic into account and the fraction is even growing. Videos  are used in many contexts. Videos include not only digitalized full-feature films, but  also tutorials, screencasts, and  not to forget them  fun movies. One characteristic of  videos is they are real multi-media. Videos contain audio and images, which makes  them a good carrier for a certain type of information but takes a lot of storage space  from the content perspective.  Videos are good for humans, but not for machines. It is easy for small programs called  robots, used by search engines such as Google or Yahoo!, to crawl websites with large  amounts of text and index it. This is difficult to do with binary  video  data; as for  other multimedia types, specifying valuable metadata eases this issue.  In this chapter, we will see how we can add videos to our Plone site and what Plone  does with them out of the box. As in the previous chapters, we will investigate some  third-party products that aim to improve the video story of Plone.  We will see the difference between streaming and downloading a video, and learn  techniques to provide both transport mechanisms with Plone.  As another topic, we will examine how to present our video content with   embedded video players. On our list there is a short introduction to Plumi, a  complete web-based video managing solution built on top of Plone. Finally,   we will glance at HTML5 where the video element is natively built-in and   presenting video through the Web will be very easy.   Managing Video Content  The topics covered in this chapter are:   	 Using the File content type of Plone for simple video management  	 Streaming videos stored in Plone with Flash  	 Embedding videos in rich text with Kupu  	 Enhancing the video features of Files, Folders, and Collections with    p4a.plonevideo   	 Embedding external videos utilizing the Link content type and the    p4a.plonevideoembed product   	 Using collective.flowplayer to include videos into a Plone site   in various ways   	 Trying Plumi, a complete video solution for Plone  	 Previewing the video element of HTML5 to include videos in web pages  Managing videos the Plone way If you have read the previous chapters carefully, you might already have guessed  what's coming now. Plone does not come with a Video content type out of the box. It  utilizes the File content type to provide limited support for binary data. All it does is  extract the MIME type and provide the file for download. This is practically the same  as to what Plone does with audio files.  [ 86 ]   Chapter 4  Accessing video content As it is the same content type, File, the accessing methods for audio and video  content are the same in a standard Plone installation. With the visual editor we   create internal Link objects. In page templates we use the absolute_url method  to provide a download link to the object, and in scripts we use the accessor  method of the file field:   >>> binary = context.getFile    This method returns the data wrapped into a Zope OFS.File object. To access the  raw data as a string, we need to do the following:  >>> rawdata = str binary.data   For additional details you may investigate the first part of the previous Chapter 3,  Managing Audio Data. The other File type restrictions and specials such as no workflow  and the ID that are generated from the filename apply here too.   [ 87 ]   Managing Video Content  Separate workflows for audio and video content If you host audio and video  and other binary  content with a Plone  site and plan to add a workflow, it is not possible to distinguish the  single binary types from each other. This means you must use the  same workflow for audio and video content. It is possible to have a  more complex scenario with the use of state script hooks, but this is  beyond the scope of this book. Another way of providing separate workflows for audio and video  content is to subclass the File content type. With two separate  content types for audio and video, it is possible to have two separate  workflows too.   Accessing video content through the Web For accessing video content through the Web, we have basically two options:  downloading and streaming.  When we download a file from a server we need to wait until the whole file is  transferred from the server to the client before we can access  play, manipulate,   and so on  it.  When we stream a file from a server, the file is accessed shortly after the download  has started. Streaming is very useful for video content. It is possible to preview  the first part of a video before downloading it as a whole. Although streaming  is commonly used for audio and video content, it is not limited to these types.  Documents stored as PDF can be streamed as well.  Downloading content Providing content for download is the easiest way from the CMS perspective. The  only thing that needs to be done is to provide a link pointing to the content.   My Video   [ 88 ]   Chapter 4  Doing so with Plone is very straightforward. We create File objects and link them  into our pages with the visual editor. It might be worth considering not storing  binary data in the ZODB with File objects. As an alternative, we can provide the  files from a separate web server or web cache and point to them with Link objects  in Plone. We lose some of the metadata and search capabilities, but may gain a  performance increase in this case. Additionally, we prevent the ZODB from growing  too big. Although the ZODB and the Zope publisher can handle binary data well,  they were not made for this purpose. Maintenance tasks do take a lot of time and  CPU resources if the ZODB gets unnecessarily big.  Streaming content There are several different methods to get content streamed to the Internet.  Unfortunately, there is no standard way to accomplish this task. Streaming content  is not part of the HTML specification until version 5. To stream content with HTML  4, we need a plugin for our browser that can handle the stream. There are different  browser plugins for different types of content. On some systems we even need extra  plugins for different types of video formats.  There are two HTML elements that are used to embed plugin content into   HTML pages: 1.  Object 2.  Embed  Traditionally, Microsoft uses the object element and Netscape Mozilla uses the  embed element. Nowadays, all common browsers understand both tags. In practice,  both elements are mixed to get maximum cross-browser compatibility. Using the HTML object element The object element is meant to embed a data source from an object outside the  HTML page. It is supposed to be generic enough to deal with a big number of use  cases. The object element is used to include Word texts, PDF documents, Excel  spreadsheets, videos, audios, Flash movies, SVG graphics, animations, and even  executables such as Java and ActiveX components.  The element itself does not display the content, but relies on an applicable plugin  being installed. Its intention is to simplify the HTML code. The inline element  object has a  param subelement that is used to communicate with the embedded  object by passing default options to it.  [ 89 ]   Managing Video Content  There are two methods to distinguish the type of object that will be embedded.  One is the MIME type and one is the ActiveX method. For the first case we specify  the MIME type of the embedded object with the type attribute.  <object type="video quicktime"         data=".. static mymovie.mov"          height="220" width="240">     Your browser cannot display Quicktime with MIME    The other option is to use ActiveX. This method works better on Windows and is less  error prone. Instead of specifying the MIME type, we use the classid attribute for  setting the class identifier for the corresponding ActiveX control.   <object classid="clsid:02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B"               height="220" width="240">               Your browser cannot display Quicktime with ActiveX     Using the HTML embed element Netscape introduced the embed element into its Navigator browser a long time ago.  The intention was to allow multimedia content to be embedded into a web page. The  element was never included into the HTML standard. Still, it is commonly used to  include multimedia plugins into HTML.  <embed type="video quicktime"        src=".. static mymovie.mov"        height="220" width="240">  Streaming the content using Flash All the streaming techniques presented so far are insecure because they depend on  special browser technologies and on third-party software installed on the web clients  to play a movie. There might be different plugins necessary for different movie  formats such as QuickTime or MPEG. To work around this problem, there is another  way for streaming content through the Web and that is Flash.  Adobe Flash is a multimedia platform that is used to create and publish multimedia  content consisting of vector graphics, audio, and video content.  [ 90 ]   Flash needs a browser plugin to be executed correctly, but this plugin is installed  in most operating systems out of the box. To stream videos with Flash, they are  transformed in a special format FLV  Flash Video  on the server side or embedded into  a Flash file  SWF . This file can be embedded easily into any web page.  Chapter 4  <object data="movie.swf"         type="application x-shockwave-flash"         width="500" height="500">              Today using Flash for presenting video content embedded into an HTML page  seems "the way" to go. The advantages of this solution are obvious. A data provider  only needs to make sure one plugin and not several different plugins exist on the  client. The appearance of the video can easily be controlled. On the one hand the  look of the video  its size, aspect ratio, and so on  is the same on all clients, and on  the other hand the visual appearance can easily be customized. Most of the time not  only is the video shown on the page, but it is also enclosed by some controls for the  video, such as the play, pause, full-screen, volume, and time slider buttons.  Streaming video content with Plone None of these embedding techniques work with Plone out of the box. But there are  two very simple methods to embed video content stored in the site without installing  any additional product. One method is to allow embedding videos in the visual  editor. The other method is to provide a custom content view to show the necessary  HTML parts for video embedding. Let's look at both.  Embedding videos with Kupu Since version 1.4, Kupu has supported including videos. However, this feature  is disabled by default for security reasons. The object, the embed, and the param  elements are stripped from HTML edited with Kupu. If we want to include videos  with Kupu, we need to do the following.  [ 91 ]   Managing Video Content  We need to go to the Plone control panel  Site Setup  and select HTML Filtering.  Alternatively, we can call the @@filter-controlpanel view on the site directly:  [ 92 ]   Chapter 4  This view is intended to manage the allowed HTML on the site globally. There are  three kinds of tags: the nasty, stripped, and custom tags. Plone allows all valid  XHTML elements except the ones listed in the nasty and stripped tags, plus the  ones listed in custom tags. The nasty tags are cleared completely including their  content. For the stripped tags the element is removed, but the content is preserved. To allow the embedding of videos into rich text, we have to remove the object and  the embed element from the list of the nasty tags. Further, we have to add the embed  tag to the list of custom tags. As stated earlier, the embed element is not part of the  official HTML specification and thus it needs to be allowed manually.  After saving the changes, we are ready to include videos into Kupu. There is no GUI  for this task. Probably the simplest way is to create an internal link to the object first.  We switch to HTML mode and replace the element with the necessary embed and or  object element.  If we want to enable video embedding in Kupu without doing a manual  site configuration, we can do this by including the following script into our  customization product.  Import the default lists of the valid and nasty tags, and define new lists  for manipulation:  def allowVideoTags portal :     from Products.PortalTransforms.transforms.safe_html       import VALID_TAGS     from Products.PortalTransforms.transforms.safe_html       import NASTY_TAGS     valid_tags = VALID_TAGS.copy       nasty_tags = NASTY_TAGS.copy    Remove the embed and object elements from the list of the nasty tags:      nasty_tags.pop 'embed'      nasty_tags.pop 'object'   Add both elements to the list of valid tags:      valid_tags['embed'] = 1     valid_tags['object'] = 1  Prepare a dictionary that is useable for the configuration of the portal_transforms:      kwargs = {'nasty_tags': nasty_tags,                                 'valid_tags': valid_tags}  [ 93 ]   Managing Video Content  Get the safe_html transform of the portal_transforms:      transform = getattr getToolByName portal,                         'portal_transforms' , 'safe_html'   Finalize the data. Because a dictionary can't be passed to the set_parameters  method, it has to be separated into keys and values. Also, the transform requires   all dictionary values to be set at the same time.      for k in list kwargs :         if isinstance kwargs[k], dict :             v = kwargs[k]             kwargs[k+'_key'] = v.keys                             kwargs[k+'_value'] = [str s  for s in v.values  ]                             del kwargs[k]  Set the new values:   transform.set_parameters **kwargs   If we call this method with the setuphandlers hook of our policy, product video  embedding with Kupu feature will be available on product installation.  This is probably the fastest way of embedding videos in pages served from Plone.  It can be done with a single configuration task, but there are security concerns.  If we use this method we need to trust the editors of our Plone site. The changes  we did are global for the site. HTML containing the embed and object elements  is considered to be safe now. Bear this in mind, if you use this solution. There is  another way to provide streaming video with an unmodified Plone. All we have to  do is to create a custom view for our video context.  A custom view for streaming videos Let's see how to embed a video file utilizing the object element in a custom view.  First, we create an empty Plone template:  <html xmlns="http:  www.w3.org 1999 xhtml" xml:lang="en"       xmlns:tal="http:  xml.zope.org namespaces tal"       xmlns:metal="http:  xml.zope.org namespaces metal"       xmlns:i18n="http:  xml.zope.org namespaces i18n"       lang="en"       metal:use-macro="here main_template macros master"       i18n:domain="plone">        [ 94 ]   Chapter 4           We use the MIME type variant of the object element for choosing the video format.  The MIME type is available as default for all uploaded files. If we want to use the  classid attribute as a separator, we need to provide a mapping from MIME type to  the classification identifier first. Let's fill the macro slot with the object element next.       <object type="video quicktime"           data=""          tal:attributes="type context get_content_type;                          data context absolute_url"           height="220" width="240">     Your browser cannot display Quicktime with MIME         Don't omit the height and width parameters. The video does not know of its  dimensions. We cannot extract the video dimensions from the standard file type either,  so we have to predefine a size. The video will not be scaled to this size. If the values  chosen are too big, an empty space is left around the video. If the values chosen are too  small, not all of the video will be displayed and the controls may be hidden.  That's it. We can put the view in a custom product if we have one. We can make   a BrowserView out of it, or we simply can place it in the custom folder of the  portal_skins.  [ 95 ]   Managing Video Content  This is probably the easiest way to teach Plone streaming video content with all the  advantages and shortcomings discussed before. To actually play the video, the client  browser needs to ensure the availability of the plugin used for playing the uploaded  video. And this is what it looks like playing a QuickTime movie on Firefox:  [ 96 ]   Chapter 4  Enhancing Plone's video features Now as we all know, a simple content type such as File with only the Dublin Core as  metadata set and a download link is not sufficient for modern video management.  Usually, we want more and, fortunately, there is more. For video enhancing content  in Plone there are two strategies. First, there is ATVideo. ATVideo is a classic Plone  product. It is mainly targeted at the 2.5 series of Plone and comes with its own  content type that takes care of all the logic with video processing. ATVideo was never  officially released, but there is an alpha version on plone.org that works for Plone  2.5 and the trunk from the collective repository might work for Plone 3.x.  If you start a new video project, don't use ATVideo but investigate  p4a.plonevideo or collective.flowplayer. Caring about  ATVideo is only sensible if you have to migrate video content to  one or the other recent video solution.  Like the other products from the Plone4Artists family, p4a.plonevideo does not come  with its own content type but modifies the File content type using marker interfaces  to get a standalone video content type. Taking the MIME type as the distinguishing  characteristic, File objects are separated into movie and non-movie objects.  The p4a.plonevideo product If you have read the previous chapters, this might be familiar for you. The product  p4a.plonevideo enhances individual content objects on the fly. Two types of  content objects are considered:   	 Files  	 Folders  [ 97 ]   Managing Video Content Converting standalone file content into videos All objects marked with p4a.video.interfaces.IPossibleVideo can get video  enhanced when created. For the default installation, only the File content type is  marked with this interface. As for audio, the MIME type is used to separate video  files from other content. The product recognizes the following MIME types:  Format QuickTime  Flash  Real-Media  Windows Media Video  MIME types video quicktime  video mp4  video mpeg  video x-m4v video x-flv  application x-shockwave-flash  application x-flash-video application vnd.rn-realmedia  video vnd.rn-realvideo  audio x-pn-realaudio video x-msvideo  video x-ms-asf  video x-ms-wmv  video x-ms-wma  video x-ms-avi  Files with one of the specified MIME types are marked with two interfaces:  p4a.subtyper.interfaces.ISubtyped  p4a.video.interfaces.IVideoEnhanced  The title of the object is set from the video title, which is taken from its metadata.  Additionally the width, height, and duration of the video are stored as annotations  on the Plone content and some additional input fields are provided for every object.  We find editable fields for a rich text description, image, author, and a read-only field  for the MIME type. Unlike for the p4a.ploneaudio type, this is a separate field and does not override  the original description.   [ 98 ]   Finally, the default view is changed and it looks like this:  Chapter 4  In the default view, we see an embedded applet of the video on the left side. On  the right side, we find the metadata extracted from the video and under the player  applet we find two links. One link is labeled with the name of the video and points  to a simple download of the video file. The other link, which is above the download  link, is labeled depending on the format of the video file  for example, it says Play  QuickTime version for QuickTime movies . This link starts playing the video with  an appropriate embedded player. For QuickTime, the link is handled with the vPIP  javaScript library  http:  vpip.org . vPIP stands for videos Playing in Place and  dynamically embeds a video after the user clicks on an enhanced link. The download  button can trigger a simple download    also.   [ 99 ]   Managing Video Content  Writing metadata Writing back metadata to the video file is not available  yet  in  the p4a.plonevideo product as it is with p4a.ploneaudio.  A pop-up player is planned but not implemented yet.  Enhancing containers with video features The product comes with a subtyper for containers  Folders and Collections . Every  object marked with the p4a.video.interfaces.IPossibleVideoContainer  interface can be converted into a Video Container by selecting the appropriate  subtype. By default "Folders", "Large Folders", and "Topics" are possible video  containers. If we need to, every folderish object type is suitable to be marked as  IPossibleVideoContainer.  Turning a possible video container into an actual video container marks it with two  extra interfaces:  p4a.subtyper.interfaces.ISubtyped  p4a.video.interfaces.IVideoContainerEnhanced  And the default view is changed to video-container.html, which is defined in  the p4a.video product:  [ 100 ]   Chapter 4  On this view we see a list of all video-enhanced objects in the folder. The view is very  similar to the summary view for Folders in Plone. On the right side, we see the full  title, plain description, and the number of video comments. Unique to this view is  the preview image of the video, if it is available, and the duration time below.  On the right top of the content area there is an RSS icon. Clicking on this icon gets us  a podcast feed of the container.  [ 101 ]   Managing Video Content Migrating ATVideo content to p4a.plonevideo  content If we have a site with ATVideo content and want to switch to p4a.plonevideo,  there is a migration utility available. p4a.plonevideo comes with the  migrate-atvideo-configlet.html page. Clicking on the migrate button on  the page walks all the ATVideo objects on the site and does a couple of actions  on them: it converts them to normal File objects, subtypes them, marks them with   the p4a.video.interfaces.IVideoEnhanced interface, and changes the default  view the newly created files. After we have migrated all the ATVideo content, we can  remove the ATVideo product from our instance.  Embedding external videos with   p4a.plonevideoembed Maybe we don't want to host all our videos ourselves, or we want to refer to a video  located at YouTube, Yahoo! video, or blib.tv. For this purpose there is a product  called p4a.plonevideoembed. This product patches the Link content type. All  we need to do is to add the URL to the video page and the video is automatically  embedded into our Plone site. The integration even works together with the video  container of p4a.plonevideo.  If we put media-enhanced links into a video container, the videos will be listed in the  video overview and will be present in the RSS feed of the container. You may now  ask—how does the extraction work? We don't have MIME types here. Right, all we  have is an URL that is parsed for certain providers. If it is known, a freshly created  link will be converted to a video-enhanced link by attaching the following two  interfaces:  p4a.subtyper.interfaces.ISubtyped  p4a.plonevideoembed.interfaces.IVideoLinkEnhanced  Additionally, the default view changes.   In Plone 3.3, the default view for the link content type is the   redirection to the URL it points. This behavior changes if you have   p4a.plonevideoembed installed. You get a view with the video  from the external provider embedded then.  [ 102 ]   p4a.plonevideoembed comes with a pluggable provider system for the inclusion  of video websites that are easily extendible. It comes with a long list of providers  out of the box. Unfortunately, video sites change their API from time to time or  disappear completely. For this reason it is hard for a third-party product such as  p4a.plonevideembed to keep up to date with link and page parsing.  The following providers worked when I tested them while writing the book:  Chapter 4   	 Vimeo  	 CollegeHumor  	 MySpace video  	 QuickTime movie links  	 blip.tv  	 YouTube  	 Flash movie links  *.flv   	 Video Detective  	 Google Video  	 Metacafe  	 Revver  	 USTREAM   	 Yahoo video  	 Veoh  	 V-Spot  	 LifeLeak  For the following services the inclusion didn't work, but it is likely that it will with   a future version of the product:  The following sites had problems, so the inclusion could not be tested:   	 VMIX  seems to provide content for paying customers only   	 SuperDeluxe  redirects to www.adultswim.com and videos couldn't be   viewed because the author is outside the USA  iFilm  does not exist any more, redirects to spike.com    	  [ 103 ]   Managing Video Content Adding a custom provider to p4a.plonevideoembed The p4a.plonevideoembed product comes with an impressive list and probably the  most common video providers on the Internet. Nevertheless, it might be necessary to  add another video site as a provider for a customer just because it is fresh and hot. It  is not very hard to do so. The main components for this purpose are named adapters  and a named utility. Let's analyze what happens when a link gets added to Plone  and p4a.plonevideoembed is installed.  After submitting the form with the required fields, title, and URL, a subscriber  to the IObjectModifiedEvent is called. This subscriber gets a utility providing  the p4a.videoembed.interfaces.IURLType interface. The utility takes the URL  and needs to return the name of the provider. Although it is possible, it will not  usually be necessary to change the standard utility. It works by collecting all  named utilities registered for the p4a.videoembed.interfaces.IURLChecker  interface and returning the name of the utility if the check succeeds. The URL comes  from adapting the object on the p4a.videoembed.interfaces.ILinkProvider  interface, which basically returns the remoteUrl attribute of the content attribute  in the standard case for the Link content type. We seldom need to change any of  these default components if we add a custom provider. What we mainly do is to  provide a named utility providing IURLChecker and an adapter with the same name  implementing the p4a.videoembed.interfaces import IEmbedCode interface.  This seems rather complicated when you read it, but it is very easy if you see the  code. Let's see an example. We want to support videos from links pointing to the  provider myvideo.de. First, we define the URL check utility and the HTML tag  generator adapter in zCML:   <configure     xmlns="http:  namespaces.zope.org zope"             xmlns:five="http:  namespaces.zope.org five">             <adapter name="myvideo"             factory=".myvideo.myvideo_generator"  >   <utility name="myvideo"            component=".myvideo.myvideo_check"  >      [ 104 ]   The utility checks if a specified URL is valid and the video information can be  extracted. The adapter provides the HTML snippet to embed the video player code.  Chapter 4  EMBED_HTML = """" <object     style='width:470px;height:406px;'     width='% width s'     height='% height s'>                  <embed src='% video_url s'       width='% width s'       height='% height s'       type='application x-shockwave-flash'                allowscriptaccess='always'              allowfullscreen='true'>   """"  First, we define the HTML snippet we need for the player. We have three   variables—width, height, and video_url. These values are replaced by the  values we get from the movie page.  Next we define the checker method:  @provider IURLChecker  def myvideo_check url :     """ ... """     host, path, query, fragment = break_url url   The break_url utility method breaks the URL in four parts—host, path, query,  and fragment. host contains the host component of the URL. path contains the  path component. The query variable contains the query as a dictionary. Finally,  the fragment variable contains the URL fragment after a  marker.  Let's see an example. We assume we have an URL of the form:  http:  www.myvideo.de watch 123450?foo=bar&param=21234  Calling break_url would give us the following values:   	 host: The value would be www.myvideo.de  	 path: The value would be  watch 123450  	 query: The output would be {'foo': 'bar', 'param':'2'}  	 fragment: The output would be 1234  [ 105 ]   Managing Video Content  This checker method is registered as a utility providing p4a.videoembed. interfaces.IURLChecker. In our case, the checker method is very easy. We check for the right host by  looking for the www.myvideo. pattern at the beginning of the host component and  we inspect the path component for matching the  watch 0934454 pattern. Only if  both of these checks succeed, do we return True, indicating we are on a video page  of our provider. This code might be very different for other providers. Look at the   p4a.plonevideoembed product for some more examples.      if host.startswith 'www.myvideo.' :         pieces = [x for x in path.split' '  if x]        if len pieces  == 2 \           and pieces[0] == 'watch' \           and pieces[1].isdigit  :            return True     return False  We can increase the priority of our provider by setting an index attribute on the  checker method. Before processing the video providers, the checkers are sorted  by the index attribute. Smaller values are considered as more important.  myvideo_check.index = 50  Finally, we need a named multi-adapter that does the data extraction. It takes the  URL for the human watchable web page and the width of the video, and returns  a string containing the final HTML snippet. This HTML part is included into the  default view of the link content object. Make sure the name of the adapter is the same  as the name of the previously defined utility. This is how they are linked together.  @adapter str, int  @implementer IEmbedCode  def myvideo_generator url, width :     """ ... """     host, path, query, fragment = break_url url                pieces = path.split ' '      videoid=''     for i, piece in enumerate pieces[:-1] :         if piece == 'watch':             videoid = pieces[i+1]                         break                  video_url = 'http:  %s movie %s' %  host, videoid            height = int round 0.815*width          kwargs = dict width=width,                                          height=height,                      video_url=video_url      return EMBED_HTML % kwargs   [ 106 ]   Chapter 4  With the IEmbedCode adapter we construct the HTML snippet we include in our web  page. In p4a.videoembed there is a video-embed.htm view that renders the snippet.  What we do here is to change the watch part of the video URL into movie. For our  provider, www.myvideo.de this is sufficient. The URL http:  www.myvideo.de  watch 0123456 results in a video_url http:  www.myvideo.de movie 0123456.  We get the width of the video as an option and the height is 0.815 times the width.  This equals to a ratio of 470:383 pixels. The method fills the string template we  defined before. The snippet is rendered in the video-embed.htm view, which is part  of in the link_view. The link_view is the default view for Link objects in Plone.    And that's it. After restarting or reloading our instance, it is possible to include  videos from www.myvideo.de by adding URLs of the form http:  www.myvideo. de watch 0123456 to Link objects.  Adding collective.flowplayer Besides ATVideo for older versions of Plone and p4a.plonevideo and  p4a.plonevideoembed for more recent versions of the CMS, there is a third  approach in dealing with the inclusion and presentation of videos with Plone.   The product is named collective.flowplayer and provides support for  playing videos on the content type File, on a folder or collection, in a portlet,  and even in the content space. It is a wrapper for the open source video player  Flowplayer  http:  flowplayer.org  . The product needs a recent version of  Plone from the 3.x series.  One main restriction of the product is that it assumes the used videos are in the Flash  video format  .flv . Fortunately, the conversion is not too hard to achieve. All we  need is some extra software to convert our existing videos to the desired format.  The Flash video format If we don't create our videos exclusively with Macromedia Flash, which will almost  never be the case, our videos will not be in the Flash video format. Therefore, we  need to convert our videos to this format. For this purpose, we utilize the ffmepg  library  http:  ffmpeg.org . The ffmpeg library is a fast video encoding, converter  and is available on all common platforms.  [ 107 ]   Managing Video Content  A GUI for FFmpeg The software marks itself as experimental and does not provide any  prebuilt packages. However, it is not too hard to find packages and  frontends for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux on the Web. A nice  frontend for Mac OS X is ffmpegX  http:  www.ffmpegx.com  .  On Windows or Linux you can use WinFF  http:  winff.org  .  FFmpeg can be executed directly using the command line. There are a lot of options  to specify. You will probably need a scientific degree if you want to understand them  all, but the program comes with sensible defaults. The simplest way to execute the  program is the following:  $ ffmpeg -i myvideo.avi myvideo.flv The source format will be recognized from the input file extension.  [ 108 ]   Chapter 4  In the screenshot of the Mac GUI for ffmpeg  FFmpegX , we see an example of the  types of options we may additionally specify. One group is the video parameters,  which contains the settings of video codec, the size, and the frame rate for the video.  Another group is the audio parameters group, which contains the settings of audio  codec and the sampling rate. Besides some general options, there is the filter group  where we may include subtitles or crop the video.  Using the collective.flowplayer product Now that we have our videos in the right format, we can install collective. flowplayer on our Plone site. We do so by including the egg and ZCML in our  buildout. After a buildout run and a restart, we are ready to install the product as   an add-on.  Enhancing files and links We know that there is no additional content type, from p4a.plonevideo  but files with the Flash video extension *.flv will be marked with the  collective.flowplayer.interfaces.IVideo interface and the default view  will be changed to flowplayer. Setting the layout property does the trick.  collective.flowplayer and p4a.plonevideo If you have both video-enhancing products installed on the site and add  a Flash movie as a File, the following will happen. The File will still be  marked with the marker interfaces of p4a.plonevideo, but the default  view will be taken from collective.flowplayer  flowplayer  in  the first place. You can change this to the p4a.plonevideo view   file_view  at any time.  Another way to include video content with collective.flowplayer is using the  Link content type. This is analogous to p4a.plonevideoembed. If we create a link  that points to a Flash video, we will get the flowplayer default view as we get  for Files.  [ 109 ]   Managing Video Content Enhancing containers If we install collective.flowplayer on our site, we will have an additional view  for containers. The view is named flowplayer and is available for "Folders", "Large  Folders", and "Collections". It shows a player applet with a playlist of all direct video  contents of the Folder. All other content of the Folder is ignored. If we have Flash  videos in a deeper structure of the Folder, they will be ignored also. The video player  resizes to the size of the largest video in the playlist.  Showing videos in portlets collective.flowplayer comes with a video portlet. As you might have guessed, a  Flowplayer instance is shown in the portlet. We need to specify a container in the site  with the videos to be displayed in the portlet. There are some more options to set:  [ 110 ]   Chapter 4  A required option is the title of the portlet, which is shown at the top in the   Portlet header section. The source of the videos, which is a container in the site, is  also an essential option. By default the player does not start automatically. To avoid  a blank  black  screen we may specify a Splash Image, which is shown before the  player is used.  [ 111 ]   Managing Video Content  Next, we may limit the number of videos to be played. No value or zero will play  all videos in the container. Setting the random flag will randomize the order of the  playlist by setting a CSS class random on the div enclosing the player applet in the  portlet. This will tell the Flowplayer to show the wanted behavior. Finally, there is a  flag for setting a Show more... link on the bottom of the portlet. This link points to  the video container of the portlet and is rendered in the footer section of the portlet.  The size of the video is set to a fixed value by CSS. The height of the video is 100  pixels and the width of it is set accordingly. This is defined in flowplayer.css file  in the CSS directory of the product.  .portletFlowPlayer .video {     display: block;     height: 100px;     width: 100%; }  Inline inclusion of videos Lastly, there is a fourth way of including a Flowplayer instance into the Plone UI.  It is simply done by adding a given CSS class to an a element or the div element  enclosing it. This method has two advantages. First, it works without JavaScript. This  can be important if JavaScript is disabled on the client side. The other positive aspect  is that the player can be included into every content page with rich text support.  To create a standalone player, we use a markup like this:                     We can also use a   ...   around the a  element if we prefer to. A video player showing the video in video-file.flv would replace this part. The  video would start with a splash screen image from splashscreen.jpg. The image is  optional, but if it is specified, the player will be sized to the dimensions of the image.  We can also get a more stripped-down player by using:  <a class="autoFlowPlayer minimal"     href="path to video-file.flv">               [ 112 ]   Chapter 4  To get a playlist, we can use a markup like this:       Video one            Video two              We can also add minimal to the list of classes for the outer div element to change  the appearance of the player, or add random to get a randomized playlist. The splash  image is optional.  Visual editor integration To make it easier to use the type of markup outlined above to insert a video or audio  player into a Plone content item, this product installs a few visual editor paragraph  styles. We can use them like this:  1.  We will insert the image we want to use as a splash image. We should insert  this "inline"  rather than left right floating , preferably in its own paragraph.  2.  We will select the image and make it link to the .flv file we want to play. 3.  We will select one of the video styles from the "styles" drop-down.  Setting options The Flowplayer has many options to show customized behavior. Most of these  options are not accessible using the Plone UI, but need the ZMI to be changed. The  options are global for the site. This implies all Flowplayers used will share them.  For example, if we set the autoplay flag, all Flowplayer instances in our site will  autoplay, no matter if they are Files, Links, or portlets. The only exceptions are inline  Flowplayers. They work without JavaScript, so setting JavaScript options has no  effect on them.  [ 113 ]   Managing Video Content  The options can be found in the flowplayer_properties property sheet in the  portal_properties. Let's see what options we can set. Only four properties are  Plone specific:  Property title  loop  showPlaylist  True  initialVolumePercentage  50  Value Flowplayer  properties False  Description The title of the property sheet. It is not  used any further. Start videos from beginning after they  have finished playing. Renders a video playlist on the container  view. Sets the initial audio volume of the video  in percent  0-100 .  All other properties are directly converted to the JavaScript code that is used to control  the Flash player applet. Not all possible configuration options Flowplayer supports  are exposed by the default installation of collective.flowplayer. We can add more  configuration options if we want to. For a complete list of possible options, browse  through the Flowplayer documentation  http:  flowplayer.org v2 player   configuration  . The following properties are set on installation of the product:  Property param src  plugins controls  url  plugins audio url  Default value ${portal_url}   ++resource++collective. flowplayer  flowplayer. swf ${portal_url}   ++resource++collective. flowplayer  flowplayer. controls.swf ${portal_url}   ++resource++collective. flowplayer  flowplayer. audio.swf false  clip autoPlay  clip autoBuffering  false  Description URL of the flowplayer Flash  applet.  URL of the controls Flash  applet.  URL of the audio flowplayer  Flash applet.  Start playing of media  immediately, if set. Flag indicating whether  loading of the clip into  player's memory should  begin straightaway.  [ 114 ]   Property clip scaling  Value fit  Chapter 4  Description Defines how video is scaled  on the video screen. Available  options are:  fit: Fit to window by  preserving the aspect ratio  encoded in the file's metadata.  half: Half-size  preserves  aspect ratio .  orig: Use the dimensions  encoded in the file. If the  video is too big for the  available space, the video is  scaled using the fit option.  scale: Scale the video  to fill all available space.  Ignores the dimensions in the  metadata. This is the default  setting.  Removing Flowplayer To remove the Flowplayer, we need to uninstall the product in the normal way.  Unfortunately, uninstalling the product doesn't remove all traces of the product.   If we remove the product from the instance and have Flowplayer-enhanced files   in our Plone site, we will get errors like:  TypeError:  'iteration over non-sequence', <function Provides at  0x10f4130>,   ,   , <InterfaceClass  p4a.subtyper.interfaces.ISubtyped>, <InterfaceClass p4a.video. interfaces.IVideoEnhanced>    This is simply because the import location of the collective.flowplayer. interfaces.IVideo interface is not available any longer. To get rid of  collective.flowplayer completely, we need to remove all of these markers  from our content. We can do this in the following steps:  1.  Uninstall the product as an add-on product. 2.  Call the following routine to remove all the marker interfaces from    the content:  [ 115 ]   Managing Video Content  We define the removal code as a conditional BrowserView: <browser:page   zcml:condition="installed collective.flowplayer.events"   for="Products.CMFPlone.interfaces.siteroot.IPloneSiteRoot"   name="remove-flowplayer"   class=".flowplayer.RemoveFlowPlayerView"   permission="cmf.ManagePortal"    >  The view is only available if collective.flowplayer is installed and is  protected by the ManagePortal permission: from Products.Five import BrowserView from zope.component.interface import interfaceToName from Products.CMFCore.utils import getToolByName from zope.component import getMultiAdapter from collective.flowplayer.events import remove_marker  class RemoveFlowPlayerView BrowserView :      def __call__ self :  Import the marker interface:        from collective.flowplayer.interfaces import IVideo  Get the catalog the Plone 3 way. This method is preferred over a   getToolByName call because the tools view returns contextless cached  versions of all Plone tools.          tools = getMultiAdapter  self.context, self.request ,                                   name='plone_tools'         catalog = tools.catalog    Get all objects providing the IVideo interface and iterate over them:         brains = catalog object_provides=interfaceToName                                          self.context, IVideo          for brain in brains:  Remove the marker from each object. The remove_marker method is  provided by collective.flowplayer itself. It removes the interface  and updates the index_provides index afterwards.             obj = brain.getObject              remove_marker obj   [ 116 ]   Chapter 4  Delete the layout property if it is set to flowplayer's default value  flowplayer. The view is no longer available after uninstalling the product.            if obj.getProperty 'layout'  == 'flowplayer':                obj._delProperty 'layout'   Finally, give a feedback on how many objects have been processed: return  'Removed IVideo interfaces from %i '                'objects for cleanup' % len brains   3.  Remove collective.flowplayer from the Zope instance. Normally this is   done be removing or commenting the corresponding lines in the buildout  configuration file and rerunning the buildout.  4.  Restart the instance.  Following these four steps will remove collective.flowplayer in such a way  that the site is still usable afterwards. The process preserves the content, the index,  and any additional metadata added to the content. There are still some persistent  adapters around, which give some logging noise but do not throw any serious errors  or prevent content from being accessed.  Removing audio markers You need to use the same technique to remove IAudio markers  from audio-enhanced content in your Plone site. You have to  replace all occurrences of IVideo with IAudio in the view used  in step two of the removal process.  Plumi: A complete video solution If we plan to provide a complete video site with content rating, content licensing, an  optional blogging extension, and other nice-to-have features available in other Web  2.0 sites, it may be worth investigating Plumi. Plumi is a complete video solution for  Plone. It combines video enhancements from p4a.plonevideo, the Plone blogging  engine Quills, and some other product candy. It comes with its own skin, which is  located in the plumi.skin package.  [ 117 ]   Managing Video Content  At the time of writing, the stable version 0.2.1 needed the quite old Plone 2.5.x as  a dependency, but a beta-version of 3.0 appeared on the screen. This version is a  complete rewrite of the package for recent versions of Plone. Some preliminary tests  showed the package was mainly working but still had some hard edges, which may  be softened or removed in the meantime:  Plumi supports the following features  from its product page   http:  plone.org products plumi  :   	 Upload video in any format  over HTTP   	 Custom templates for browsing videos  	 Expanded video metadata set   	 Classification system into country, genre, and topic using ATCountry    Widget and ATVocabulary Manager   	 Tagging using Vaporisation  [ 118 ]   Chapter 4   	 RSS feeds with media enclosures  or "vodcasts"  created automatically   based on taxonomy items, for example country, genre, member, topic,   or through creating custom collections using qRSS2Syndication   	 Playback of QuickTime, Flash video, Real, and Windows Media within    the browser using vPIP   	 Automatic server-side Flash transcoding and embedded playback     	 Custom profile page for site members with personal, latest videos    using IndyTube  vodcast feed   	 Customized workspaces and video publishing workflow  	 Content Licensing including Creative Commons licensing  through    their API , the GNU Free Documentation License, or you can add   custom licenses or use traditional Copyright   	 The addition of qPloneComments adds e-mail notification if someone   comments on a video or responds to a comment and allows fine-grained  administration of commenting; also addition of a comments portlet to the  front page  A strength of Plumi is the good classification system. It exposes the video metadata  to the catalog and makes it available for organizing videos in collections.  Installing Plumi To install the 0.2 series of Plumi, we download the tarball from www.plone.org and  put its contents in the Products folder of our site. If we have a buildout-based setup  of a Plone 2.5!, we can add the URL to the productdistros section:  [productdistros] recipe = plone.recipe.distros urls =   http:  plone.org products plumi releases 0.2.3 plumi-0.2.3-final.tgz nested-packages =   plumi-0.2.3-final.tgz  Plumi has a dependency on the imsvdex library. This library reads and writes  vocabularies in the IMS Vocabulary Definition Exchange format. It is available as an  egg on PyPi and can easily be added to the buildout:  [instance] ... eggs =     ${buildout:eggs}    imsvdex  [ 119 ]   Managing Video Content  The 3.0 series of Plumi, which is targeted on Plone 3, comes with its own buildout.  We find it in the public repository of EngageMedia:  svn co https:  svn.engagemedia.org project plumi-buildout-plone3 tags  plumi-3.0-beta1  plumi-buildout-plone3 Running the bootstap.py script and then the bin buildout script normally  processes the buildout. After this, we add a standard Plone site and install PlumiSkin for the 0.2 version  and Plumi Application Setup for the 3.0 version. These products install the  customized layout of the Plumi application and act as a policy product resolving  all product dependencies. For the 0.2 version, we need to make sure we install  ATVideo before we install the PlumiSkin product and we have a working MailHost  configured. Otherwise it refuses to install.   Getting more information Plumi has a wiki. You might get more information at   http:  plumi.org wiki and special information for the upcoming  version 3.0 at http:  plumi.org wiki Plumi3.0WorkPlan.  Plumi is registered as a product on www.plone.org and has a project  page there http:  plone.org products plumi  .  Preview: HTML5 As for audio content, there will be a separate video element on it's own in the  upcoming HTML version 5. The element name is hard to guess—video. The   video element comes with a handful of attributes:  Attribute autobuffer  Value autobuffer  autoplay  autoplay  controls  controls  height loop  pixels loop  Description If present, the browser will load the file because it  will most likely be played, but will be ignored if  autoplay is present. If present, the video will start playing as soon as it  is ready. If present, the user is shown some controls, such as  a play button. Sets the height of the video player. If present, the media file will start over again every  time it is finished.  [ 120 ]   Chapter 4  Attribute src width  Value url pixels  Description The URL of the video to play. Sets the width of the video player.  Unfortunately, there are major issues with choosing a codec, which will be included in  the standard HTML specification. The codec H.264  see Appendix A for a description   seems to be the most promising candidate for serving as default codec. Although it  is published under an open source license, it is still protected by license fees and not  all browser manufacturers are willing will be able to pay these. Some manufacturers  have concerns about the license-free Ogg Theora codec. So for now it is very unclear  which codec will be used in the final standard specification, if there is any.  A custom view with HTML5 Let's write a simple view utilizing the HTML5 video element.  <html xmlns="http:  www.w3.org 1999 xhtml" xml:lang="en"       xmlns:tal="http:  xml.zope.org namespaces tal"       xmlns:metal="http:  xml.zope.org namespaces metal"       xmlns:i18n="http:  xml.zope.org namespaces i18n"       lang="en"       metal:use-macro="here main_template macros master"       i18n:domain="plone">          <video src=""           tal:attributes="src context absolute_url"           controls="controls"          autoplay="autoplay">A Video            In this simple page we mainly include the HTML5 video element to provide a  streaming player. The player has the autoplay mode on. It will start when the page  is loaded and it will show controls at the bottom of the video because the controls  attribute is set.  [ 121 ]   Managing Video Content  Summary In this chapter we looked at managing video content with Plone. We saw the  difference between downloading and streaming video data, and how we can use  these techniques with Plone. Starting from the built-in File and Link content types,  we explored different methods to manage video data and embed videos in web  pages. For this purpose, we examined the enhancing products p4a.plonevideo,  p4a.ploneembedvideo and collective.flowplayer. As a practical example,  we wrote a custom adapter for p4a.ploneembedvideo to access a custom video  provider. We took a very short look at Plumi, which aims to be a complete video  management solution built on top of Plone. Finally, we previewed HTML5, which  provides a native video element. This element allows streaming video data on a  web page directly without the need of a Flash player or a client plugin.  [ 122 ]   Managing Flash Content  In this chapter we will take a closer look at Flash as content. In Chapter 4, Managing  Video Content, we already saw Flash and worked with it. There we used Flash as a  helper and as a container to stream video content. We will see other use cases for  Flash in the upcoming chapters  for example, a bulk uploader in Chapter 8 , but this  is not what we want to discuss here. In this chapter we will investigate Flash from  the content perspective. In that case, Flash is commonly referred to in the expressions  Flash movie or Flash applet. A Flash movie is the binary content itself looked at from  the backend side. A Flash applet is the content, embedded into HTML, looked at  from the frontend side.  Flash is a multimedia format designed especially for the Internet. It is used to  distribute multimedia content such as movies, games, interactive applications, and  banners. In this chapter we will see how we can include Flash in the web context  with Plone. In the usual manner, we will continue and see what support Plone has to  offer for Flash out of the box. We will learn how to include a Flash applet into Kupu  to display it inline on a page and as a portlet. Another topic in this chapter will be the Flash 10 issue. With version 10 of Flash,  Adobe—the manufacturer of Flash—introduced a security feature that is not  compatible with older versions of Plone's publishing mechanism for binary data.   In this chapter we will learn how to fix this issue.  Next, we will see some products that help us to manage Flash content with Plone.  We will investigate ATFlashMovie, which provides a dedicated content type for  Flash movies and allows presenting these in a standalone variant as a portlet or as a  Collage component. We will learn how to extract the metadata from Flash using the  Python product hexagonit.swfheader, and use this information to create a custom  view for Flash movies.    Managing Flash Content  Furthermore, we will take a little excursion to SilverLight. Silverlight is a relatively  new multimedia format, which is similar to Flash but not as widely adopted. It  allows the development of multimedia applications for the Web with the .NET  platform. We will see how to include such content with Plone.  Finally, we have a practical section where we will create a small Flash applet  ourselves with the help of the Python library pyswftools. In this chapter we will learn the following:  Including Flash applets into HTML pages   	  	 Using Kupu to embed Flash applets into Plone pages  	 Fixing the Flash 10 issue in Plone versions prior to 3.2  	  	 Working with Flash metadata with hexagonit.swfheader  	  	 Generating Flash applets on the fly with pyswftools  Including Flash content with ATFlashMovie  Including Silverlight content into Plone  What is Flash? A general definition of Flash can be found on Wikipedia  http:  en.wikipedia. org wiki Adobe_Flash :  Adobe Flash  previously known as Macromedia Flash  is a multimedia platform  originally acquired by Macromedia and currently developed and distributed   by Adobe Systems. Since its introduction in 1996, Flash has become a popular  method for adding animation and interactivity to web pages. Flash is commonly  used to create animation, advertisements, and various web page Flash components,  to integrate video into web pages, and more recently, to develop rich Internet  applications.  Flash is able to manipulate vector and raster graphics, supports streaming of  audio and video, and comes with a scripting language called ActionScript. Flash  content is either authored with dedicated authoring software such as the "Adobe  Flash Professional multimedia authoring program" or it can be put together  programmatically with libraries such as "Ming". Files in the Flash format usually have the .swf, or .flv extension. To display such  files we need player software. This player software can be a web browser plugin or  a standalone Flash player; or for simple videos, an FLV-aware player such as VLC,  QuickTime, or Windows Media Player can be used.  [ 124 ]   Chapter 5  Including Flash in HTML We now see an example of how to include Flash into a static HTML page:  <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD HTML 4.01  EN"        "http:  www.w3.org TR html4 strict.dtd">      Include a Flash-application as an object        Worms in Flash!    Click "Start". Then hit "space". Try to catch the number with the  worm. Don't touch obstacles or borders!       <object classid="CLSID:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"            width="600" height="400"           codebase="http:  active.macromedia.com flash2 cabs                       swflash.cabversion=4,0,0,0">                                   <embed src="nibbles.swf" quality="high" scale="exactfit"              menu="false" bgcolor="000000" width="600" height="400"              swLiveConnect="false"            type="application x-shockwave-flash"            pluginspage="http:  www.macromedia.com shockwave download                           download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash">                   The example contains an object element, which embeds the Flash application in  the Microsoft way. The classid attribute refers to the desired implementation.  For Flash applications, we always use classid="CLSID:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf- 96B8-444553540000".  [ 125 ]   Managing Flash Content  With the codebase attribute, we can specify a web address where the Flash plugin  can be downloaded, if it is not installed on the client side. In the preceding example,  we use version 4 of Flash. If we utilize a Flash application using version 5, the  codebase link would be http:  active.macromedia.com flash5 cabs  swflash.cabversion=5,0,0,0.  The codebase link for the recent version 10 of Flash is http:   download.macromedia.com pub shockwave cabs flash   swflash.cabversion=10,0,0,0.  We can pass parameters to a Flash application. They are specified as <param  name="..." value="..."  >. The most important one for Flash is the movie  parameter. Its value contains the address of the included Flash file. Further we include an additional embed element into the object element for all the  browsers that don't support the object notation. The address of the Flash application  is here specified with the src attribute. This cumbersome double inclusion of the object element with the nested embed  elements is considered a robust solution because it is supposed to work on almost  every web browser. The maker of Flash officially advises it. The disadvantage of this  strategy is the use of a non-standard HTML element. The produced HTML is invalid.  Another way of including Flash with valid HTML is the following:  <object width="425" height="350"   type="application x-shockwave-flash" data="movie.swf">        A movie with .... You need Flash to see it.     If we want valid XHTML, we need to close the param tag:  <object width="425" height="350"   type="application x-shockwave-flash" data="movie.swf">        A movie with .... You need Flash to see it.     This variant uses the object element that is part of the original HTML specification  with the type attribute. The type attribute takes the MIME type of the embedded  external object. The MIME type is application x-shockwave-flash in the case  of Flash.  [ 126 ]   Chapter 5  Flash and HTML5 There is no dedicated element for including Flash in HTML5. Some people believe  Flash will become obsolete as HTML5 and CSS3 are becoming standard in the  Web world. With audio and video support built in the standard, the need for an  additional plugin is superfluous.  But HTML5 is not the web standard now and it will still take years until it will  be. And there is the codec discussion. As long as the browser manufactures don't  agree on common codec for audio and video data, Flash is lesser evil in distributing  multimedia content through the Web.   Plone handles both Flash file types  FLV and SWF  as standard Files.  For a detailed explanation of File access methods, look at Chapter 3,  Managing Audio Content.  Flash in Kupu Since version 1.4 Kupu has understood Flash. For security reasons, including Flash  in content edited with Kupu is disabled by default. To enable Flash in Kupu, we  need to allow the object, embed, and param elements to be inserted into Kupu. We  have seen this before in Chapter 4. For including videos, allowing object and embed  elements is sufficient. For Flash, we additionally have to allow the param elements. The param element is a subelement of the object element and is used to set values  for the application called by the object element. So what we do is remove the param tag from the list of striped tags if we  just need a through-the-Web configuration. If we need a more persistent   site-independent solution, we have to modify the allowVideoTags method  of the mm.enhance product:  valid_tags['embed'] = 1 valid_tags['object'] = 1 valid_tags['param'] = 1  [ 127 ]   Managing Flash Content  The param tag is not in the nasty tags list, so we don't have to remove it from there.  After finishing the configuration, we can upload a Flash application as a Plone File  and refer to it with Kupu as we saw before in the Including Flash in HTML section. If  the inclusion is valid, Kupu will display a placeholder in the edit view:  The Flash 10 issue With Flash version 10, Adobe introduced a new security feature. A HTTP request  response has an optional header field ContentDisposition. The two allowed values  are attachment and inline.  [ 128 ]   Chapter 5  Content-marked inline will try to display itself on the page directly, assuming the  correct plugin handler is installed. The purpose of the attachment directive is to indicate to the browser that the file  being returned should not be rendered on the page as active content. For example,  imagine we are reading e-mail messages on a web-based service and we click on  a link that represents a file attached to a message. The server may well respond  with a ContentDisposition: attachment header—meaning, "Hey browser, don't  open this file. Save it to disk instead." This header can sometimes serve a security  purpose: If a server provides files that were uploaded by untrusted users, the  ContentDisposition: attachment header can help prevent those files from being  executed in the server's domain. Starting with version 10.0.2, if Flash Player sees a ContentDisposition: attachment  header while downloading a SWF file, it will ignore the SWF file rather than play it.  Working around the Flash 10 issue Older versions of Plone generally set the ContentDisposition to attachment. This  issue affects you only if you are using a Plone version up to 3.1.7. There are several  methods to work around it:   	 Upgrade Plone to 3.2 or later  	 Patch the file module of the Archetypes product manually  	 Use a patch product such as Flash10Fix  There is not much to say about option one. If you can, upgrade your Plone version;  upgrading within the series 3 should be smooth and easy to handle. There is one  main thing you need to know about it. All Plone versions from 3.2 come completely  eggified. This changes some parts of your buildout configuration significantly. The  "Plone" section used in Plone 3.1 downwards is obsolete. Plone is added like any  other egg to the instance. Additionally, you need to take care of pinning the versions  of all eggs Plone uses. There is a versions.cfg distributed for every Plone release at  http:  dist.plone.org release .  If for one or another reason you can't upgrade, you have to patch the Archetypes  product. You can do this manually by changing the following lines of the download  method of the FileField class in the Fields module:  1153.            else:    1154.               filename = unicode filename,                       instance.getCharset    1155.            header_value = contentDispositionHeader  1156.                disposition='attachment',  [ 129 ]   Managing Flash Content  to:  1157.                filename=filename  1158.

RESPONSE.setHeader "Content-Disposition",                                        header_value   This patch will change the request header for Flash files. If the filename ends with  .swf, the disposition header is set to inline. In all other cases the default behavior  is used. The default behavior is to set the disposition header to attachment.  If we don't want to fiddle with the sources of the Plone core, there is a product that  does the patch for us. The advantage of this solution is that we have better control  of what is going on. We can uninstall the product at any time if we don't need it any  longer and none of the original Plone code is touched.  To install the product, make the Products.Flash10Fix egg available to our Zope  instance. We don't have to install the product as an add-on, as it only contains  a patch. The patch of the Flash10Fix product works slightly differently from the  previously shown manual one. The File content type has an inlineMimetypes  attribute. It is a tuple containing MIME types, which will return with the  ContentDisposition as inline. It is hardcoded and cannot be changed through  Plone or the ZMI. The patch adds application x-shockwave-flash to the  inlineMimetypes tuple.  [ 130 ]   Chapter 5  Products targeting Flash There are some products for Plone that target the inclusion of Flash applications in  Plone. If we have a Flash movie, we can always use the movie products we already  saw in the previous chapter such as collective.flowplayer and p4a.plonevideo.  If we have more complex Flash content, such as games, tutorials, quizzes, and so on,  these products are not sufficient solutions. If we want to include the "raw" Flash and  not wrap it with a movie player, we could use ATFlashMovie.  Using ATFlashMovie to include Flash applets  in Plone ATFlashMovie  http:  plone.org products atflashmovie  is a product for  storing Flash movies in Plone. It brings its own content type derived from the File  content type. There are several enhancements done compared to the simple file.  While uploading a file, ATFlashMovie extracts the dimensions and uses them for  displaying the content later. The product is not available as an egg. We have to add it to the productdistros  section of our buildout. If we have a productdistros section already  this is the  case if we use a standard buildout generated by paster, or if we use one of Plone's  installer packages , all we need to do is to add the URL to this section. This section  allows the inclusion of classic Zope products. It takes a list of URLs as an option.  These URLs point to ZIPs or tarballs of classic products. While running the buildout,  the products from these URLs are downloaded, extracted, and made available to the  Zope instance. If we have no distro part, we have to add one first:  [buildout] newest = false parts =     zope2     instance     productdistros  ...  [productdistros] recipe = plone.recipe.distros urls = http:  plone.org products atflashmovie releases 1.0.3   ATFlashMovie-1.0.3.tar.gz  ... [instance]  [ 131 ]   Managing Flash Content  recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance ... products =    ...    ${productdistros:location}  Additionally, we need to announce the productdistros location to the instance part  to make sure the products are added to the search path of the Zope instance. After  running the buildout, we restart the instance and install the product as an add-on  product. It is listed as ATFlashMovie there. After doing so, the product is available to the Plone site and Flash Movies can be  added to the site. Let's add one and see what we get:  [ 132 ]   Chapter 5  The first three fields Title, Description, and File are inherited from the File content  type. The other three new ones are Scale, Background color, and Show technical  informations. As Flash content is vectorized, it can easily be scaled to any custom  size. ATFlashMovie provides the predefined scales of 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, 150%,  and 200%.  [ 133 ]   Managing Flash Content  Another parameter to customize is the background color. Flash movies support  transparency. With this option, we can set the value for the background color for  transparent areas. If Products.SmartColorWidget  http:  plone.org products  smartcolorwidget   is installed, the widget will be a nice jQuery color selector  as  shown in the previous screenshot . The color widget is optional. If it is not available,  setting the background color is done by a simple string-widget. The widget takes a  RGB hex value with a "" character in front. ff0000 is the right value for red and  2adf5a is a green color, as shown in the screenshot. Products.SmartColorWidget  is available as an egg on PyPi. Finally there is the Show technical information checkbox. If it is selected, there is a  collapsible area in the view mode showing the width, the height, and the version of  the Flash file.  After successfully submitting the Add Flash Movie form, Plone switches into the  view mode and shows the Flash applet we just uploaded. ATFlashMovie uses the  object element to display the content. A typical example looks like this:  <object     type="application x-shockwave-flash"              data="http:  localhost:8080 site nibbles.swf index_html"     width="700" height="420" bgcolor="2adf5a">   <param name="movie"          value="http:  localhost:8080 site nibbles.swf index_html"          bgcolor="transparent"  >            A Flash portlet The ATFlashMovie product comes with a portlet for displaying Flash. To use a Flash  applet as a portlet, we have to add a Flash content object first. The portlet has no  options to configure. It only comes with a selection widget to choose one from all the  Flash movie contents of the site. It is resized to the scale specified at the content type  itself. The technical information is not shown in any case. For the header, the title   filename  of the Flash movie object is used. The following screenshot shows what a  Flash portlet looks like:  [ 134 ]   Chapter 5  Flash in a Collage view ATFlashMovie comes with a third possibility for including Flash movies into a web  page. It provides a Collage slot. Collage is not a core component of Plone, but is an  additional product  http:  plone.org products collage  . It allows aggregating  and displaying multiple content objects on one page. Collage is available as an egg  on PyPi, and is installed in the usual way by adding the egg to the buildout and  installing the product as an add-on.  Collage is designed to be very extensible. It allows the registering of specific  content views that are exclusively used within the aggregated view. To expose a  view to Collage, it needs to be registered for the Products.Collage.interfaces. ICollageBrowserLayer layer.  [ 135 ]   Managing Flash Content  The definition of the ATFlashMovie Collage standard view is:  <browser:page      zcml:condition="installed Products.Collage"      name="standard"      for="Products.ATFlashMovie.interfaces.IFlashMovie"      permission="zope.Public"      template="collage_standard.pt"      class=".browser.CollageStandardView"      layer="Products.Collage.interfaces.ICollageBrowserLayer"       >  The standard view is just the Flash part itself. There is another layout "portlet"  available. This page includes the header and the footer portlet section all enclosed  by a definition list  the dl element , which makes it look like a portlet. In the header  section, the title of the Flash object is rendered. The footer section displays the  localized date field and the rights field of the content.  Extracting Flash metadata with   hexagonit.swfheader A developer product to work with Flash content is hexagonit.swfheader   http:  pypi.python.org pypi hexagonit.swfheader . The product is purely  Python with no dependencies on Zope or Plone. It is a metadata parser for Flash  files. It is commonly used to extract the dimensions of a Flash movie for rendering it  on a web page.  Let's look at the following scenario. We want to provide Flash support without the  use of ATFlashVideo, but utilizing the built-in File content type. We could do so by  providing extra components for files having the Flash MIME type application  x-shockwave-flash.  What we will do is to provide a marker interface for Flash content. While adding  Flash content, the dimensions of the movie will be extracted with the help of  hexagonit.swfheader and annotated to the content. Additionally, we will provide a  view using the annotated dimensions.  [ 136 ]   The basic components of a custom Flash content  type First, we need to define some interfaces for our components:  Chapter 5  from zope.interface import Interface  class IPossibleFlashVideo Interface : pass  class IFlashVideo Interface : pass  IPossibleFlashVideo is a marker interface for objects of certain content types that  potentially can be turned into an enhanced Flash movie. In our example, this is the  File content type. Another sensible use case could be to mark ATFlashVideo with the  interface to provide additional functionality.       <implements       interface=".interfaces.IPossibleFlashVideo"  >    IFlashVideo is the marker for enhanced objects. Adapters and views designed for  Flash applications bind on this interface. The interface itself does not require any  attributes or methods. Next, we need an activator for the IFlashVideo interface. We do this by subscribing  to zope.lifecycleevent.interfaces.IObjectModifiedEvent.  Next, we need a handler for our subscriber:    <subscriber       for=".interfaces.IPossibleFlashVideo        zope.lifecycleevent.interfaces.IObjectModifiedEvent"       handler=".flash.attempt_media_activation"        >     We import all the stuff that we need later.  from cStringIO import StringIO import zope.interface import hexagonit.swfheader from Products.Archetypes.annotations import getAnnotation from mm.enhance.interfaces import IFlashVideo  [ 137 ]   Managing Flash Content  Only files with the application x-shockwave-flash MIME type are considered.  def attempt_media_activation obj, event :      if obj.get_content_type   == 'application x-shockwave-flash':  Set the marker interface on the file object.  zope.interface.alsoProvides obj, IFlashVideo   The parse method of hexagonit.swfheader takes a file-like object or the path to a  Flash file. We use the first option and create a file-like object from the binary data of  the File content type.          rawdata = StringIO str obj.getFile  .data    Parse the metadata from the Flash movie.          metadata = hexagonit.swfheader.parse rawdata   Store the height and width of the Flash movie as a persistent annotation on the File  object. We use the helper method getAnnotation from the Archetypes product,  which saves us a lot of coding. The height is stored under the swf_height key and  the width under the swf_width key.          getAnnotation obj .set 'swf_width', metadata['width']          getAnnotation obj .set 'swf_height', metadata['height']   A view for the custom Flash content type We need to define the view in our configure.zcml. The main part is in the  flashmovie.pt template.  <browser:page       for=".interfaces.IFlashVideo"       name="flashmovie"       permission="zope2.View"       template="flashmovie.pt"       class=".flash.FlashMovieView"        >  [ 138 ]   Chapter 5  The FlashMovieView class is quite simple. It just exposes the height and width  attributes we extracted from the metadata earlier.  class FlashMovieView BrowserView :      @property     def height self :         return getAnnotation self.context .get 'swf_height'       @property     def width self :         return getAnnotation self.context .get 'swf_width'   The template looks like the following code snippet:                <object type="application x-shockwave-flash"       data=""       width="320"       height="200"       bgcolor="transparent"       tal:define="context_url context absolute_url"       tal:attributes="           width view widthdefault;           height view heightdefault;           data string:${context_url} index_html">     <param name="movie" value="" bgcolor="transparent"          tal:attributes="value string:${context_url} index_html"  >                         Using dimensions:  x<strong  tal:content="view height"  >        [ 139 ]   Managing Flash Content  Silverlight Microsoft Silverlight is a proprietary, programmable browser plugin for Windows  and Mac. It is available for Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari. For Linux,  Novell distributes the open source variant Moonlight with permission from Microsoft.  The goal of Silverlight is to be a direct competitor of Adobe Flash. It supports  the execution of Rich Internet Applications  RIAs  written on the basis of the  .NET platform.  Installing Silverlight On Windows and Mac systems, Silverlight is easily installed with the  system-specific installer provided at the Silverlight home page  http:  www. silverlight.net  . After installing and restarting the browser, we see the  plugin listed if we put about:plugins into the address bar of the Firefox browser:  Installing Moonlight on Linux The Linux open source distribution of Silverlight, called Moonlight, can be  downloaded from the project home page of Moonlight  http:  www.go-mono.com  moonlight  . The stable version of Moonlight was 2.0 at the time of writing, which  was able to execute Silverlight 2 and 3 applications.  [ 140 ]   Chapter 5  The plugin is mainly targeted at the Firefox web browser. There may be other web  browsers that are capable of using the plugin, but this is not supported. There are  some How-Tos on the Internet for solving this need. According to the home page,  Moonlight should work on any modern 32-bit and 64-bit Linux distributions under  Firefox 2.0, 3.0, and 3.5. The following distributions are explicitly mentioned: SUSE  Linux Enterprise Desktop 11, openSUSE 11.x, Ubuntu 9.10, and Fedora 12. Moonlight  will run on older distributions, but may require that you build Moonlight from  source code. To find out more about how to do this, check the Moonlight home page   http:  www.go-mono.com moonlight-beta  .  Including Silverlight content Silverlight content has the MIME type application x-silverlight-2 and the  .xaml or .xap extension for ready compiled and packed applications. The usual  inclusion of Silverlight content looks like:  <object data="data:application x-silverlight,"            type="application x-silverlight-2"         width="640" height="480">                <a href="http:  go.microsoft.com fwlink ?LinkID=124807"       style="text-decoration: none;">     <img src="http:  go.microsoft.com fwlink ?LinkId=108181"           alt="Get Microsoft Silverlight"          style="border-style: none" >         Plone doesn't know anything about Silverlight in its vanilla state. To allow the  inclusion of Silverlight content, we first need to tell it about the Silverlight MIME  type. For this purpose, we go to the mimetypes_registry of the Plone site and add  the Silverlight information there. Without any changes, the Silverlight application  content  *.xap  is recognized as an archive. The content type guesses of Plone works  correctly here, as the Silverlight application is nothing else than a ZIP archive of a  controller XML file and a set of DLLs containing the application itself.  [ 141 ]   Managing Flash Content  The mimetypes_registry can be accessed through the ZMI as the tool with the  name mimetypes_registry on the Plone site. This is the place where Plone  manages all its valid content types. On the first tab MimeTypes, we find a Add  a new mime type button, which we click to add the Silverlight MIME type. We  add the following values:   After doing so, we are ready to integrate Silverlight content into our site. We just  need to add a standard File object with the XAP file. Then we create a reference in  Kupu to the file. This assumes we allowed the object and the param element before.  If we don't want to create a custom view for this purpose, we can use the  FlashMovieView from before as an example. All we need to do is change the MIME  type and slightly modify the object element.  [ 142 ]   Chapter 5  pyswftools: Manipulating Flash   with Python With Python it is possible to create Flash applications on the fly. To do so, we need  the Ming library  http:  www.libming.org   and the Python implementation of  SWFTools: pyswftools. The Ming library is an open source library for writing Flash  applications with several languages including C, Perl, Ruby, PHP, and Python.  Installing pyswftools To install Ming, download the sources and build it with the usual cmmi commands  on Linux and Mac OS X:  $ make install This will install the Ming library written in C. To install the Python wrapper, we  have to go to the py_ext directory and install the extension:  $ . configure  $ make  $ cd py_ext  $ python setup.py install If the install fails with  running build  running build_py  error: package directory ' home anderson ming ming py_ext' does not exist we have to patch the setup.py:  srcdir = " home anderson ming ming py_ext" curdir = srcdir = os.getcwd    We need to comment out the srcdir line and define the srcdir variable the same  way the curdir variable is defined.  We have to make sure that we use the same Python interpreter that we use for our  Zope application. Otherwise, Zope is not able to find the libraries.   [ 143 ]   Managing Flash Content  Ming on Windows If you want to use Ming on Windows, you have to compile it  yourself. There is detailed documentation available on how to  install the library at  http:  eratosthenes.wordpress. com 2006 04 26 compiling-ming-on-windows  .  After installing Libming together with the Python wrapper, we can test if everything  works by starting a Python interpreter and importing the ming library:  $ python ... >>> import ming >>>  Doing so should not raise any errors. Next, we install the Flash tools wrapper for  Python. Its sources are available on SourceForge  http:  sourceforge.net  projects pyswftools files  . We download and unpack it, and install the egg  in the Python that we use for Plone. Unfortunately, the inclusion of the egg in the  buildout does not work. The sources are bundled into a directory and the buildout  mechanism doesn't descend into this, and thus does not find the setup.py.  $ tar xvzf flash-tools-0.2.0.tar.gz $ cd flash-tools-0.2.0 $ sudo python2.4 setup.py install After we have installed the library, we can use it in our code. pyswftools provides  three modules for accessing the Flash API:   	 flash_geometry  	 flash_svg  	 flash_utils  Using pyswftools pyswftools allows the transformation of SVG files into Python code. This powerful  mechanism is content of the flash_svg module 2. The explanation of this technique is  beyond the scope of this book. Let's look at a simple example with a handful of objects.  What we do is to create a movie with a green square that rotates and moves from top  to bottom.  We start with the usual imports. Most of the classes and methods are imported from  the pyswftools wrapper for Ming. Only the SWFSprite is taken from Ming directly  simply because there is no wrapper.  [ 144 ]   Chapter 5  from flash_utils import FlashShape, FlashMovie, FlashColor from flash_geometry import Point from ming import SWFSprite  We will start by defining a flashsquare.swf view for our dynamic Flash movie.  This view will be accessible everywhere in the site, but only be available if flash_ utils is installed. We do not need a template because all we return is a stream of  binary data.  <browser:page       zcml:condition="installed flash_utils"       for="*"       name="flashsquare.swf"       permission="zope2.View"       class=".flash.FlashRectangleView"        >  As we generate the Flash movie on the fly, we provide a BrowserView with just a call  method. This method returns the Flash movie as binary data. Calling this view in a  browser directly will not give a sensible result. It needs to be embedded in a page first.  class FlashRectangleView BrowserView :      def __call__ self :  Draw a green square with a length of 20 pixels and a green border of 2 pixels. The  canvas of Flash starts in the upper-left corner. This is the zero point  0, 0 . All other  points are relative to this point. Thus,  -10, -10  is outside the canvas. Our square  is drawn 10 pixels above and 10 pixels left of the origin.          shp = FlashShape           shp.setLine 2, clr=FlashColor.green          shp.drawRectangle Point -10, -10 , 20, 20   Add the previously created square to a sprite and fully rotate the square in 10 degree  steps. A sprite is a submovie in a Flash movie. It may contain its own animation and  can be controlled independently from the main movie.          spr = SWFSprite           di = spr.add shp          for idx in range 36 :             di.rotate 10              spr.nextFrame    [ 145 ]   Managing Flash Content  Create a movie with white background, a height and width of 100 pixels, and a frame  rate of 10 frames per second.          m = FlashMovie           m.setBackground clr=FlashColor.white          m.setDimension 100, 100          m.setRate 10   Add the sprite with the square to the movie, and move the rotating square from the  top to the bottom. As said before, the rotation of the sprite is independent of the  movement of the object.          di = m.add spr          for idx in range 0, 100 :             di.moveTo 50, idx              m.nextFrame    To get the raw data of the Flash content, we need to do a little trick. The base C  library of Ming contains a output method that allows outputting the Flash content as  a binary stream. Unfortunately, this method is not exposed to the Python wrapper.  In version 0.4.2 of the library, we save the Flash movie as a temporary file and fetch  the content from there.          fh, name = tempfile.mkstemp           m.save name          return os.fdopen fh, 'r' .read    To include the Flash movie into a page, we need to add the following snippet to the  HTML page:  <object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"  codebase="http:  active.macromedia.com flash5 cabs swflash. cabversion=5,0,0,0" height="100" width="100">         <embed width="100" height="100" align=""           src="flashsquare.swf"          play="true" loop="true" quality="high"           type="application x-shockwave-flash"            pluginspage="http:  www.macromedia.com go                         getflashplayer"  >    We can do this with Kupu if we allowed the object and embed tags earlier,  or we could write a custom view or even a portlet for this purpose. What about   a dynamic portlet showing a dynamic bar diagram with the number of objects for  each content type?  [ 146 ]   Chapter 5  The Ming library has a slowly growing codebase. It is heavily used in the PHP world,  but is kind of exotic in the Python world. There are some bugs in the code and not all  of the features of the base library are available in the Python wrapper  see the output  method . Still it is a good, if not the only way, to create Flash content dynamically. More examples are at the how-to page of pyswftools  http:  pyswftools. sourceforge.net howto.html .  Summary In this chapter we learned about including Flash and Silverlight content into Plone.  After a short introduction on Flash itself, we learned how to include Flash applets  into Kupu without using any third-party software.  Next, we showed some techniques and patches to work around the Flash 10 issue,  which prevents the serving of recent Flash content from older Plone sites.  Furthermore, we looked at the two products ATFlashMovie and hexagonit. swfheader. Both these products help to improve the inclusion of Flash content into  Plone. They provide ways to parse the Flash metadata and to present the Flash  movie in a stable way in several different locations on the site.  Another topic we investigated was Silverlight, a direct competitor of Flash from  Microsoft. We saw how to install the plugin and to add its MIME type to the Plone  registry to make the inclusion of Silverlight content into Plone possible.  Finally, we created some Flash content dynamically by utilizing the Ming library.  [ 147 ]    Content Control  In the first part of the book we learned about content types, and how they can be  used and enhanced to serve special needs for multimedia content. The next chapters  will be about working with this content. If the amount of content grows, we need  means to control it. Storing millions of videos in one Plone folder is inefficient in  many ways. In this chapter we will focus on the accessibility of content with Plone.  This chapter is not about barrier-free websites. It's about structuring big amounts of  data in an efficient way.  The main focus will be on categorizing data. As a full-grown content management  system, Plone does a lot for structuring its data. It comes with an index and provides  a dedicated content type for grouping selected content.  Another topic we will hit is tagging and rating. Almost every web platform with  user-generated content provides one of these techniques, if not both, for controlling  content. We will see some products that bring tagging and rating support to Plone,  and glance at some Tag Cloud products.  Finally, we will investigate some more means of content control such as geotagging  and licensing. Google maps has become a widespread Internet service nowadays.   We will see how to use this service to geolocate our Plone content.  Lastly, we will have a word on licensing. Often user-generated multimedia content  is released under a Creative Commons License. We will see how to attach such a  license to content in Plone.  The code examples for the chapters in this part will be in the  mm.process package. For better readability, the examples for the whole  book are split in packages corresponding to the part they are used in.    Content Control  We will learn the following things in this chapter:   	 Structuring content with folders and subfolders  	 Setting Dublin Core metadata for Plone content  	 Using Collections to collect and structure content  	 Automating content manipulation with content rules  	 Enhancing the categorization features of Plone with the PloneGlossary   product   	 Doing per user tagging with p4a.plonetagging  	 Writing a custom rating adapter for plone.contentratings  	 Using the Maps product for geolocating content in Plone  	 Attaching licenses to Plone content with collective.contentlicensing  Categorization Categorization is a process of our everyday life. We categorize papers in folders  like all bills for 2008 and all bills for 2009, or we put lentils in one box and peas  in another. It is no coincidence that the folders on our desktop and the according  content type in Plone are both called "folders".  Folder categorization This is the simplest way of categorization—the folder and subfolder structure.  A straightforward folder layout of a multimedia site could look like this:  APP  Plonesite  Public  Videos  Audios  Live  Studio  Images  Gallery1  Gallery2  Private  . . .  [ 150 ]   This organizes all different types of content in distinct folders and subfolders. The  advantage of this method is that it feels very natural. It is easily understandable  for both humans and machines. The structure can be translated to a path or a URL,  which makes it especially useful for web applications.  Chapter 6  Accessing web content methods Like many other content management systems and web applications,  Plone uses the folder structure for accessing the web content. Most web  servers share this behavior. Nevertheless, there are other techniques  for mapping URLs with web content. Another common approach is the  regular expression parsing that Django and Ruby on Rails use. They  map views with regular expressions. If the URL matches one of these  expressions, the according view is called.  Up to Plone 3.3, there were two kinds of folders—Folders and Large Folders. As  the name already suggests, Large Folders are meant to store large amounts of data.  They have two different storage strategies for the data they contain. Folders store the  data as a simple list. This approach is good for small amounts of data. The items are  ordered, but reading and writing gets expensive with more and more data.  Large Folders store the data in a B-Tree. B-Trees store their data in a binary structure  with a separate key. This makes them an effective solution for reading and writing  large amounts of data. Because of their internal structure, B-Trees are not ordered. If  we need an order, we need to do it manually.  Folders in Plone 4 In Plone 4, this arbitrary concept of Folders and Large Folders has  changed. There is only one content type Folder. This content type  takes the best from both worlds, that is, it stores the data as a B-Tree  internally and keeps a separate index for ordering the data.   Structuring the data in folders is a good thing, but has its limits with large amounts  of data. Then we either have folders with thousands of objects or we have very deep  folder structures. Luckily, there are other categorization methods, one of which is the  Dublin Core.  [ 151 ]   Content Control  The Dublin Core metadata Dublin Core  DC  is a standardized set of metadata information. Wikipedia  describes it as follows:  The Dublin Core metadata element set is a standard for cross-domain information  resource description. It defines conventions for describing things online in ways  that make them easy to find. Dublin Core is widely used to describe digital  materials such as video, sound, image, text, and composite media like web pages.  Implementations of Dublin Core typically make use of XML and are Resource  Description Framework based. Dublin Core is defined by ISO in ISO Standard  15836, and NISO Standard Z39.85-2007  Plone implements most of the simple Dublin Core definition for all its standard  content types. It is spread over all edit tabs. Let's see where the DC is available   in Plone:  Field name Title Creator Subject Description Publisher Contributor Date Type Format Identifier Source Language Relation Coverage Rights  Fieldset in UI Default Ownership Categorization  Categories  Default n. a. Ownership Date n. a. n. a. n. a. n. a. Categorization Categorization n. a. Ownership  Accessor method Title Creators Subject Description n. a. Contributors getEffectiveDate Type  Format  absolute_url n. a. Language getRelatedItems n. a. Rights  The first column contains the name of the DC field. The second column shows the  tab in the edit mode where the field can be modified for standard content objects in  Plone. In the third column, there are the Python accessor methods that we can call   to fetch the DC data programmatically.  [ 152 ]   Chapter 6  Managing keywords in Plone An outstanding exemplar of the DC fields is the subject field. The subject field is used  to describe the content with a set of phrases. Today, this usually is called tagging.  Plone does not come with a very feature-rich tagging engine out of the box, but still  has some support for marking content with verbal identifiers.  As we saw before, the Categorization field is used to store keywords. This field  comes with its very own widget. The widget consists of two parts. On the left side  there is a list of existing keywords. The list is aggregated from the keywords set on  all other content of the site. We can set new keywords in the textbox on the right  side. It takes one keyword per line as shown in the following screenshot:  Not all users may add new keywords. There is a property in portal_properties  site_properties allowRolesToAddKeywords. In this property, all roles that are  allowed to add new keywords are listed. As default, the property is set to Manager  and Reviewer.  On a fresh Plone site, there are no keywords available and thus the left textbox  is empty. There is a way to provide default tags if we need to. We might want to  support the editors not to add too many keywords, or want to forbid anyone to add  keywords. Another use case might be that we import the keyword data from an  external source and need the keywords that are already available to be accessible in  the system.  [ 153 ]   Content Control  Plone comes with a tool for managing metadata, portal_metadata. It is a legacy of  CMF and it is not really used in Plone. There is one thing that might be useful— setting a default vocabulary for the subject  categorization . To do so, we go to the portal_metadata in the ZMI. There we select DCMI, which is  the default DC policy for Plone. We get to a page saying Update Element Metadata  Policies. There we click on Subject. In the Vocabulary field, we are free to add  default values that are sensible for our needs.  It is possible to specify default values per content type. Look at the following example:  In the example we have three tags  Incredible, Awsome, and Amazing  that we  allow for all content types. Additionally, we have two tags  Video and Audio   that we allow only for file content objects. All the other settings of portal_metadata are not used in Plone.  [ 154 ]   Chapter 6  Categorization methods Adding category information to a content object is one thing; aggregating this  information is another. Plone comes with two powerful helpers for categorization,  Collections and Content Rules. While Collections are made for filtering content with  DC criteria, Content Rules seem more appropriate for folder categorization. But both  techniques are not limited to this behavior and can be easily extended with some  Python code. Let's look at Collections first.  Using Collections for structuring content Collections  or Topics  are folderish content types in Plone and can be explained as  something like saved searches. Collections do not contain actual content themselves,  but refer to data from the site acquired through the catalog. A Collection contains  criteria objects and may contain subcollections.  Like any other content object, a Collection has a title and a description. It may have  a body text, which is a richtext field edited with Kupu. Usually, a Collection shows  all content that matches the criteria it is given. We can change this behavior and limit  the amount of data "contained" by a Collection. To do so, we select the Limit Search  Results box in the edit page and add a positive number in the Number of Items field. We have the normal displaying options for folderish content such as Standard  view, Summary view, Tabular view, and Thumbnail view. Additionally, we have  a dedicated view with two variants. One displays it like the standard view and the  other displays it like a table. We choose the variant on the edit page and not in the  Display action we normally use for selecting the layout. On the edit page, we find a  Display as Table checkbox and a widget for selecting the columns to display. A collection doesn't show any content immediately after it is added to the site. We  need to specify some criteria for collecting content from other places of the site. There  is a content tab Criteria for adding search criteria. Every catalog index is a possible  candidate for being a criteria field and, in fact, most of the default ones are exposed  as such.  Adding a criterion is a two-step procedure. First, we add the criterion with the type  of value we want to allow. Some fields allow choosing the way in which the field  value is entered. For example, the Creator field allows four options  Select values  from list, Restrict to current user, Text, and List of values . While Select values  from list lets us select from a list of all portal members, Text lets us enter a custom  full text.  After adding the criterion, we need to set its value. Depending on what we chose  before, the input widget might be a text field, a selection widget, or even a complex  path widget with a popup for the Location criterion.  [ 155 ]   Content Control  The number of criteria for a Collection is not limited, but every field may only be  specified once.  Criterion concatenation The criteria are concatenated using the AND operator. This means  every criterion has to be fulfilled for an entry to be displayed. Some  fields provide an operator selector for the criterion value. This  operator works on the subvalues inside the field and not between  the fields.  When finished specifying the criteria, we switch to the collection view and see the  queried results as content of the Collection. The query is executed every time the  collection view is called. Assume that we choose Item Type as a criterion and Page  as its value. Adding an additional page anywhere on the site will magically update  the Collection.  Using Collections is very efficient, as all operations are "catalog only". The retrieval  process is a simple catalog query and the catalog metadata is used for display. As  stated earlier, Collections do not expose all catalog indexes and metadata to their edit  page. Let's see how we can modify these settings. Configuring Collections The index and metadata settings of Collections can be set in the Plone configuration.  There is a Collection section in the Plone control panel. We can access the tool  directly by accessing http:  localhost:8080 site portal_atct atct_ manageTopicIndex for index, and http:  localhost:8080 site portal_atct  atct_manageTopicMetadata for metadata configuration. These pages come with a  four-column table:  1.  Catalog index: Name of the index in the portal catalog 2.  Enable: Enable this index for Collections 3.  Friendly name: Use this name in the Collection pages 4.  Explanation: A text that is shown on the edit page for Collections   describing the index  On the index page, we have an additional selection widget in the fourth column  where we specify which type of selection we want to allow in the criteria edit pages.  For a default Plone installation, the values are chosen very sensibly and normally  don't need to be changed. But if we add custom indexes or metadata to the catalog,  we may want to expose them to Collections.   [ 156 ]   Chapter 6  We have already exposed custom indexes in Chapter 3, Managing  Audio Content. This was done by the p4a.ploneaudio product,  so we didn't care about this there. The examples given in this  chapter part are taken from this product. Look there for some more  examples or more example context if you need to.  If the configuration view is called, only the enabled fields are shown. To show   all possible indexes metadata fields, we click on the link on the upper-right side  saying All fields. Let's see if we can extend and customize Collections in Plone.  Extending Collections The easiest way to extend Collections is to add custom indexes metadata through  the Web. Let's take the following example. The human-readable size of an object  for  example 62.1 KB or 1.3 MB  is exposed for collections in the getObjSize metadata  field. We want to provide a collection view with the byte size for files displayed. First, we go to the portal_catalog of the site in the ZMI. There we open the Metadata  tab and add size as metadata. This is the attribute where the raw byte size is stored.  size is a method of the ATCTFileContent class in the Products.ATContentTypes. content.base module.  After we have added the field to the metadata, we need to refresh the catalog.   We do this by clicking on the Update Catalog button on the Advanced tab of  the portal_catalog. Next, we expose this attribute via the Collections configuration in the Plone control  panel as we discussed before.  [ 157 ]   Content Control  Finally, we create a Collection for File content types that is displayed as a table:     Let's see how we can achieve this programmatically.  First we need the catalog. The preferred way to get the catalog is from the tools view:  >>> from zope.component import getMultiAdapter >>> tools = getMultiAdapter  context, request , ...                         name="plone_tools"  >>> pc = tools.catalog    For custom indexes, we add the audio_genre_id field as a FieldIndex to  the catalog. We have to update this index after we have added it.:  >>> pc.addIndex 'audio_genre_id', 'FieldIndex'  >>> pc.manage_reindexIndex 'audio_genre_id'   [ 158 ]   For custom metadata, we add the audio_artist attribute to the metadata of the  catalog. We need to refresh the whole catalog after manipulating the metadata fields.  >>> pc.manage_addColumn 'audio_artist'  >>> pc.refreshCatalog    To expose catalog fields to Collections, we need to do the following:  Chapter 6  >>> index = 'audio_genre_id' >>> index_info = {'name': 'Genre', ...      'description': 'The genre id of the song.' ...                    'this is a number 0-147. ' ...                    'See genre.py for the genre names.', ...     'enabled': True, ...     'criteria':  'ATSimpleIntCriterion', } >>> atct_config = getToolByName portal, 'portal_atct'  >>> atct_config.updateIndex index,  ...     friendlyName=index_info['name'], ...     description=index_info['description'], ...     enabled=index_info['enabled'], ...     criteria=index_info['criteria']  >>> atct_config.updateMetadata index, ...     friendlyName=index_info['name'], ...     description=index_info['description'], ...     enabled=True   This enables the audio_genre_id field for both the collection indexes and the  collection metadata. The field is an integer value between 0 and 147. Thus, we choose  the ATSimpleIntCriterion as the criterion for setting values in the collection.  If we need information from the content that is not available as a standard method  or via an Archetype accessor, Plone allows us to register custom indexable attributes.  This might be sensible if the desired information is not stored in the context itself,  but in an annotation. Let's look at the following code:  from Products.CMFPlone.CatalogTool import registerIndexableAttribute  def audio_genre_id object, portal, **kwargs :     """Return the genre id of the audio file for use in            searching  the catalog.      """     try:         audiofile = interfaces.IAudio object          return audiofile.genre  [ 159 ]   Content Control      except  ComponentLookupError, TypeError, ValueError :                      The catalog expects AttributeError when a           value can't be found                   raise AttributeError  registerIndexableAttribute 'audio_genre_id', audio_genre_id   We define an audio_genre_id method, which returns the genre code from the  IAudio annotation. This method is registered as an indexable attribute with the same  name and may be added to the portal_catalog as an index.  This code is valid up to version 3.3 of Plone. For later versions of Plone, the  registerIndexableAttribute method has been deprecated in a more flexible  component-based solution. Let's see how the same example works in Plone 3.3 and  the later versions:  from plone.indexer.decorator import indexer   @indexer Interface  def audio_genre_id object, portal, **kwargs :     """Return the genre id of the audio file for use in            searchingthe catalog.     """     try:         audiofile = interfaces.IAudio object          return audiofile.genre     except  ComponentLookupError, TypeError, ValueError :                    The catalog expects AttributeErrors when a           value can't be found                 raise AttributeError  The audio_genre_id method is decorated with the indexer decorator. This has the  same effect as calling the registerIndexableAttribute method before. We may  choose a more specialized interface than Interface, which is not specialized at all.  In this case, p4a.audio.interfaces.IAudio would be a sensible variant.  To fully enable the component, we need to define a named adapter in ZCML:  <adapter factory='.indexers.audio_genre_id'          name='audio_genre_id'  >  Some people add custom criteria as in the collective.formcriteria product or  use AJAX to acquire criteria. The discussion of these solutions is beyond the scope   of this book.  [ 160 ]   Automated content actions with Content Rules Another mechanism for categorizing content is the concept of Content Rules. Content  Rules do not categorize the content itself, but provide an easy way for automating  document structuring. A Content Rule is triggered by a certain event and executes a  defined action. Some of the possible triggers are listed here:  Chapter 6   	 An object was added to a container  	 An object was modified  	 An object was removed from a container  	 The workflow state of an object has changed  To have a more fine-grained control for executing the defined action, there are  additional filters that can be set to specify the desired context. These filters include:   	 Content type: Checks whether the current object is in a given list of   content types   	 File Extension: Checks if the current object has a given file extension.  The extension without the dot  "."  has to be specified  for  example, 'mov', if we want to filter QuickTime movies .   	 Workflow state: Checks for the workflow state of the current object  	 User's group: Executes the Content Rule if the logged-in user is in one    	 User's role: Executes the Content Rule if the logged-in user has one of   of a given list of groups  a given list of roles  A Content Rule can have only one trigger, but as many filters as needed. Filters  are processed in a sequence in a defined order. This implies that the action is only  executed if all filters pass. The possible actions are:   	 Logger: A message is sent to the event log of Zope. A name for the logger,    a level, and the message can be specified when adding the action.   	 Notify user: A status message is generated and presented to the user on    the page that is displayed after finishing the transaction.   	 Copy to folder: The object is copied to a given location in the site.  	 Move to folder: The object is moved to a given location in the site.  	 Delete object: The object is deleted. This action takes no options.  	 Transition workflow state: Attempts to do a given workflow transition.  [ 161 ]   Content Control   	 Send e-mail: An e-mail is sent. This action takes the subject, the    recipients, and the message as required options and the e-mail source   as an optional parameter.  A Content Rule may have more than one action executed. We can log, send an  e-mail, and move an object with one Content Rule.  Although there are no theoretical limits for combining actions,  there are practical ones. For example, user notification and moving  objects don't play together well. The user notification is annotated to  the current request. If a transaction is committed when moving an  object, a new request is created and thus the previously annotated  message is lost.  Let's see an example. We assume we have dedicated folders for videos and images in  our site. We want to make sure all these objects are placed in these folders. One way  would be to trust the editors, and the other is Content Rules!  We create two rules—one for video content and the other for image content. Both  Content Rules are triggered on adding an object to the site. The filter condition for  images is easy because they have their own content type. To distinguish videos from  other uploaded files, we utilize the file extension filter. In our example, we assume  only Flash videos  .flv  get uploaded to the site. Finally, we have to declare the actions. The most important is the move action, which  moves the uploaded object from any position in the site to its dedicated position.   To set up Content Rules, we access the control panel of Plone and choose   Content Rules. We can access the configuration screen directly by the URL  http:  localhost:8080 site @@rules-controlpanel.  On this page, we find a checkbox allowing us to enable or disable content rules  globally for the whole Plone site. On a standard Plone site, Content Rules are  enabled. Below the checkbox there is a table listing all defined Content Rules. This  list is empty on a fresh Plone installation. We click on Add content rule to add the  content rule, set its trigger, and add some more general information:  [ 162 ]   Chapter 6  For better readability every Content Rule has a Title, which is required, and an  optional Description. Individual Content Rules can be turned on and off by using  the Enabled option. Finally, there is a Stop executing rules option. If this option is  selected, Plone stops looking for other Content Rules after processing this rule. We  don't want this for our current example rules.  [ 163 ]   Content Control  After adding the rule, we are sent back to the overview where we see our freshly  created Content Rule. We click on it to get to the management screen to add the filter  and the actions. For the images, we choose the content type filter Image. Next we  add the Move to folder action. We select the previously created image folder there. That's it for the image rule. The steps for the Content Rule moving the videos is  practically equal to a filter for the File content type and the .flv extension. When finished with this process, we have two enabled rules. To make them actually  work, we need to enable them on a special location. As Content Rules are linked with  the concept of a folder structure, they can be activated on folders in Plone. For this  purpose, an object action Rules is shown in Folders and Large Folders. A selection widget helps us to select the Content Rules for the individual folders. We  want images and videos from any position in the site moved to the special folders.  Therefore, we activate the rules on the site. If rules are activated on a container, they only affect the current container and not   the subfolders. If we want to change this behavior  we do want this , we have to  select the Content Rule and click on Apply to subfolders. After doing so, we are ready to test the configuration. We can go to any location in  the site and add an image or a file ending with FLV, and it is moved to the "images"  or "video" folder automatically.  [ 164 ]   Chapter 6  Extending Content Rules Content Rules can be easily extended. They are defined  as adapters, views, and custom components. For some  examples, look at the plone.app.contentrules  package where the default rules are defined.  Categorization products Plone's keyword categorization is easy to use and easy to query because it is a  simple list of terms stored in a list. However, for some use cases this functionality  is insufficient. The keyword engine does not support different languages. It does  not provide hierarchies, extended keyword information, and many other possible  features. To overcome this shortcoming, there are some add-on products available.  Let's take a look on some of them.  Products.PloneGlossary A special method of categorizing content is the glossary. Content glossaries have  been known since the ancient world. They are an alphabetical list of terms together  with the definition of these terms. The classic use cases for glossaries are books,  where important terms are selected and defined at the end of the book.  If we want to add glossary functionality to our site, we need a product called  PloneGlossary. This means certain terms occurring in the pages, news, and events  are stored as glossary definitions and are highlighted on the content views.  The product is available as an egg on PyPi  http:  pypi.python.org pypi  Products.PloneGlossary . Installing the usual inclusion of the egg in our buildout  or a policy product followed by installation as an add-on product is sufficient. With  the product installed, we have a new content type: Glossary. One glossary per site  is usually enough. A glossary is a container where we can add Glossary Definitions   the second content type coming with the product . A glossary definition has three  fields—a required term, a required body text, and optional term variants  synonyms .  [ 165 ]   Content Control  Let's assume we have added the term "Plone", "Plones" as a variant, and "A great  CMS written in Python!" as body text. If we change to the starting page that Plone  comes with, we see the result immediately:  All occurrences of our term and all its variants  actually there is none on this page   are highlighted by a dotted underline. If we move over one term with the mouse  cursor, a tooltip with the term and its description  the body text  is displayed.  Make sure the glossary is accessible by all the users who  should be allowed to see the glossary. Set the workflow state to  published if it should be usable by anonymous users.   You may have noticed that some elements on the page are not highlighted  for  example, the main title and links . This behavior is configurable. PloneGlossary  comes with a configlet for Plone's control panel. The options we can set there are:   Option Highlight content  Description length  Description ellipsis  Explanation Turns the highlighting on off  globally. Length of the description shown in  the tooltip. 0 always displays the  full body text. This string is shown if the  description is too long  more  characters than description length .  Default True  0  ...  [ 166 ]   Chapter 6  Default a h1 input textarea Document, Event,  News Item False  Option Not highlighted tags  Explanation The content of these tags is not  highlighted. The field takes one  HTML element per line. Default:   Allowed portal types  Use glossaries globally  for all content  Restricts the glossary mechanism to  selected portal types. If checked, all glossaries are used  to highlight terms globally for all  of the site's content. If this option is  unchecked, only the first glossary  found while traversing upwards  from the current location is used. If glossaries are used globally,  the selected ones are taken into  account.  General glossaries  All glossaries  The content type Glossary comes with a special view that allows us to browse the  glossary catalog. There are two options for doing so. One is a list of the letters A to  Z. If there are one or more terms starting with a "M", M displays as a link showing  all terms starting with a "M". Additionally, there is a full text for finding glossary  definitions. All definition fields are indexed. For an even better survey, PloneGlossary comes with a portlet. This portlet lists all  glossary terms occurring in the currently viewed page. The terms are linked with  their definition. The portlet does not take any configuration values and can be added  as "Glossary portlet" on the portlet management page.  Other categorization solutions for Plone As said earlier, Plone's keyword mechanism is not very sophisticated. The  system does not allow hierarchical categorization and it does not allow back  links. To overcome these drawbacks, there are approaches to extend the keyword  categorization in Plone. Two products are notable here—collective.categorizing  and collective.virtualtreecategories. Both products support hierarchical categories.  collective.categorizing comes with some additional content types, which  moves the categorization to the content space. The categorization is independent   of Plone's keywords. The second approach  collective.virtualtreecategories  integrates into Plone's  keywords. It provides an alternative widget on the basis of jQuery. The category tree  is managed in the Plone control panel.  [ 167 ]   Content Control  Tagging and rating with Plone A common need for current user-driven websites is tagging content. Wikipedia  defines tag as the following:  ... a tag is a non-hierarchical keyword or term assigned to a piece of information   such as an internet bookmark, digital image, or computer file . This kind of  metadata helps describe an item and allows it to be found again by browsing or  searching. Tags are chosen informally and personally by the item's creator or by its  viewer, depending on the system. ...  In the previous chapter we saw the keyword engine of Plone, which is a   simple tagging mechanism. All the necessary components are present. We have  a "non-hierarchical keyword" associated with our content. The keywords can be  searched and even be grouped to collections. Still, we want more features available.  We want to collect tags from certain users and we want to display the top tags used  in a Tag Cloud.  In Plone 4, "keywords" has been renamed to "tags" because they  are actually more like tags than keywords.  A tag cloud is a visual representation of tags. The number of occurrences of a tag   is represented in the font size for display. The more often a tag is used, the bigger   it is displayed.  Another way of classifying content is rating. Rating is a short form of tagging. The  tag narrows to a small integer number, which is commonly displayed as a number   of stars. The more the user likes the content, the more stars he or she awards.  For both types of content classification there are products for Plone. For tagging,  there is p4a.plonetagging and for rating there is plone.contentratings. Let's  look at them both.  Tagging content with the p4a.plonetagging  product A tagging product for Plone is p4a.plonetagging. The product is a wrapper for  lovely.tag, which is a tagging engine based on the ZCA. The product provides a  powerful backend for managing tags and comes with a simple UI for managing these  tags. For individual use cases, this UI probably needs to be customized. The product  supports per-user tags and comes with a tag cloud portlet as well. To install the  product, we need to customize our Plone buildout.  [ 168 ]   Chapter 6  Unfortunately there is no working, stable release of the product.  There is a   release of the product, but the zip_safe flag is set wrong so the product can't  be integrated into Plone . We need to access the product from its development  repository  http:  svn.plone.org svn collective p4a p4a.plonetagging  trunk . We check out the product in the src directory of our buildout:  $ svn co http:  svn.plone.org svn collective p4a p4a.plonetagging trunk  p4a.plonetagging Then we can add it to our buildout:  [buildout] ... develop =     src p4a.plonetagging  We need to include the checkout of the product and not the buggy version   from PyPi.  [zope2]  For more information on this step and configuration options see:  http:  pypi.python.org pypi plone.recipe.zope2install recipe = plone.recipe.zope2install fake-zope-eggs = true additional-fake-eggs =      ZODB3     zope.app.securitypolicy skip-fake-eggs = zope.testing url = ${versions:zope2-url}  Next we need to add an additional egg zope.app.securitypolicy to the fake  eggs of our Zope application. The egg is a dependency for lovely.tag and not  included normally.  ...  [instance] recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance ... eggs =     ${buildout:eggs}     Plone     p4a.plonetagging  zcml =     p4a.plonetagging  [ 169 ]   Content Control  Despite of the fake egg inclusion of zope.app.securitypolicy, the product is  included like every other product available as an egg. We need to add the egg   and the ZCML to our Zope instance. This allows the product to be installed as   an add-on product. For adding tags to a content object, p4a.plonetagging provides a content-tags. html view, which is exposed as an object action. The view has a single text input  where we can add our tags separated by spaces. The tags are stored per user and   can be queried that way. There are some views provided for querying tags. First we have a tagging view.  It is called from the site and shows all tags entered by all users. There is a link   "Your tags"on the page directing to the tags of the currently authenticated user . Every tag has its own URL: http:  localhost:8080 site tagging tags foobar  for the tag foobar. This view shows all content objects associated with the tag.  The tags live in an optimized ZCA utility, but are exposed to the catalog through   the tags, index, and metadata, which are usable with collections too.  Objects, being taggable, must provide the lovely.tag.interfaces.ITaggable  interface. All objects inheriting from Products.CMFCore.PortalContent. PortalContent provide the interface automatically.  As said in the chapter introduction, a common need for tagging engines is a Tag  Cloud, which is a visual representation of the entered tags. p4a.plonetagging  comes with a tag cloud portlet as a classic portlet. To use the portlet, we add a classic  portlet in the portlet management view in the desired location. The template we refer  to is portlet_tagcloud and the macro stays the default portlet.  There is a configlet in the Plone control panel where we can blacklist single terms   not to be displayed in the Tag Cloud.  Using Tag Clouds with Plone At the beginning of the tagging part, we said that Plone has a complete tagging  engine but without a Tag Cloud. Maybe we don't want to switch to a completely  new tagging mechanism, or maybe we have a site with lot of content tagged already,  or we are happy with the features Plone provides, except for the Tag Cloud. For  these cases there are Tag Cloud products available, which are built on top of Plone's  keywords  tags .  [ 170 ]   Chapter 6  There are three products rendering a Tag Cloud in a portlet: Vaporisation   http:  plone.org products vaporisation  , qi.portlet.TagClouds  http:   pypi.python.org pypi qi.portlet.TagClouds , and quintagroup.portlet. cumulus  http:  pypi.python.org pypi quintagroup.portlet.cumulus . The first one  Vaporisation  has not kept up with the development on recent  versions of Plone. A test with Plone 3.3 failed. The two other products made good  impressions. Both are very configurable and still come with good default values.  While qi.portlet.TagClouds provides a classic HTML tag cloud, quintagroup. portlet.cumulus is a port of the WP Cumulus WordPress plugin  http:   wordpress.org extend plugins wp-cumulus  . The portlet uses a Flash movie  that rotates the tags in 3D. The tags are sometimes a little bit difficult to click, but the  visual experience is certainly more exciting than the plain HTML version.  Both products are available at PyPi, and are normally included via an egg  dependency and include the ZCML slug.  Rating content with the plone.contentratings  product A common use case for multimedia content is the rating of content. It is an easy  way to say whether someone likes the content or not. Many desktop audio and   video players  such as Amarok, iTunes, and Winamp  have this feature as well.   To extend Plone with rating support, we need to install the plone.contentratings  product  http:  pypi.python.org pypi plone.contentratings  with the  normal buildout followed by the add-on products installation procedure. Installing the product adds a new control panel to Plone called Ratings. This panel  provides two configuration sections—one is for associating particular content types  with rating categories, and another for adding and managing rating categories. The  default rating is turned off and we have three rating categories available:   	 Rating: Uses 5 small stars for rating  	 Short Rating: Uses 3 small stars for rating  	 Large Rating: Uses 5 big stars for rating  [ 171 ]   Content Control  On the Rating Assignments tab, we choose a portal type and then select the rating  categories to associate with the type in the multiselect below the type selector. Once  we have selected the categories, we need to save the changes before selecting another  type. This will enable a rating UI in the view for the selected type:  We can disable ratings on an individual content object on the edit form for that  content object. We uncheck the Enable Ratings checkbox on the Settings tab. The Manage Categories tab of the control panel allows us to create custom  categories, and modify or remove categories that we have created. Initially, there   are no local categories, only Acquired Categories. These are the categories defined  in the Python packages products on the filesystem and cannot be edited. To add a new category, we click on the Add Local Categories button. A category  has a required title that appears in the rating UI. All other fields are optional. A  description is provided  primarily for documentation purposes . We can enter  TALES expressions for determining when users can and cannot view or set   ratings in the category. If left blank, all users  including anonymous  are able   to both view and set ratings.  [ 172 ]   To use permissions to restrict the ratings, use an expression like  python:checkPermission 'View', context . The order in which the categories  are displayed in the UI is determined by the order attribute, which should be an  integer.  The view setting determines how the rating should appear in the UI. Python  products can register rating views to provide different look and feel or behavior. We  must click on the Save button to record our changes  including removing categories .  Chapter 6  Notes on Category Names Internally, categories are registered and accessed using unique names. For  categories created through the Web, these names are generated from the  title using a mechanism similar to that used by Plone to generate IDs for  content objects. This has a couple of consequences. If you remove a custom  category that already has rated content, the ratings will still be stored  on the content under the original category name. So if you later create a  "new" category with the same title  and hence the same name , all content  previously rated under the category will still have rating information  attached. This makes it very easy to undo a mistaken removal of a category,  but may cause some unexpected behavior. Additionally, this also makes  it possible to override a category defined globally by creating one with an  identical name. However, there is no guarantee that the names of globally  defined categories are related to their titles, so it's not always obvious how  to do this, nor is doing this recommended. You may end up with two  categories with the same title that are differentiated only by their order,  which is likely to lead to confusion when assigning categories.  Creating a custom rating category with a view Let's see how we can customize the whole process by writing a new category  with a view. First we define the category in ZCML:  <configure   xmlns="http:  namespaces.zope.org zope" xmlns:contentratings="http:  namespaces.plone.org contentratings"   i18n_domain="mm.process">  <contentratings:category     for="Products.CMFCore.interfaces.IDynamicType"     name="rate_seven"     title="Rating seven options"     view_name="seven_stars_view"     read_expr="python:checkPermission 'Content Ratings: View User                                          Rating', context "     write_expr="python:checkPermission 'Content Ratings: User Rate',                                          context "      >  [ 173 ]   Content Control  If we want the category to appear in the control panel, we have to register it for the  Products.CMFCore.interfaces.IDynamicType interface. We will use seven rating  stars instead of five. Therefore, we call our category rate_seven and the associated  view seven_stars_view. For displaying and rating content, the Content Ratings:  View User Rating and Content Ratings: User Rate standard permissions are  used. We define the rating view with:     <browser:page     for="contentratings.interfaces.IUserRating"     name="seven_stars_view"     class=".rating.SevenStarUserRating"     template="stars.pt"     permission="zope.Public"     allowed_attributes="rate remove_rating"      >     With the additional configure directive enclosing the page directive, we set  the base module for calculating the path operations. This allows us to reuse the  stars.pt template of the contentratings.browser module without copying it  over to our product.  Before we do the view class, we need to define a vocabulary we can later use in   the view:  from contentratings.browser.base_vocabs import titled_vocab  seven_star_vocab = titled_vocab        1, _ u'Poor'  ,       2, _ u'Fair'  ,       3, _ u'Ok'  ,       4, _ u'Good'  ,       5, _ u'Very Good'  ,       6, _ u'Awesome'  ,       7, _ u'Excellent'      To activate the vocabulary in the component registry, we do the following in ZCML:  <zope:utility     name="mm.enhance.rating.seven_star_vocab"     component=".rating.seven_star_vocab"      >  [ 174 ]   Chapter 6  Content ratings comes with a base view  BasicUserRatingView , which can be  easily used for extending the rating UI. We simply provide the size of stars in pixels,  which is 12 in our case. This size is used for the original version as well. If we want  to change it, we have to provide additional rating stars or alternative images in  the CSS. For having seven stars instead of five, we use the name of the previously  defined vocabulary.  from contentratings.browser.basic import BasicUserRatingView  class SevenStarUserRating BasicUserRatingView :     """A view that specifies seven medium stars"""   star_size = 12  px       vocab_name='mm.process.browser.rating.seven_star_vocab'  That's it. Including this in our customization product mm.process enables the  seven-star rating category for our site. It looks like this:  Other means of content control There are many other forms of controlling and categorizing content. Probably there  are as many types of categorization as there are types of content. In the last part of  the chapter we want to investigate two more of them. We will take a closer look at  geolocation and licensing.  [ 175 ]   Content Control  Geolocation of content with Google Maps A common need nowadays is to locate content. As said in Chapter 2, Managing Image  Content, some digital cameras support the geolocation of their images and videos.  But it makes sense for other content types as well. Maybe we want to locate an audio  file with information about where it was recorded. Maybe it is the recording of a live  performance of a band.  A geolocation is nothing more than two floating-point numbers—the longitude and  the latitude. Latitude is the angle from a point on the Earth's surface to the equatorial  plane, measured from the center of the sphere. Longitude is the angle east or west of  a reference meridian between the two geographical poles to another meridian that  passes through an arbitrary point. A tuple of these values is called coordinates. Any  point on this earth can be exactly identified by this tuple. Luckily, we don't need to  know about these technical definitions to geolocate content with Plone. All we have  to know is that geolocation is as simple as storing two floating-point numbers.  Thanks to Google maps service, accessing and  more importantly!    presenting geodata is very easy. Google provides it own platform at   http:  maps.google.com where it provides access to the location service.  The service can be used with a given API. All we have to do is to sign up for   an API key at Google  http:  code.google.com apis maps signup.html .  For Plone there is a wrapper Product for integrating Google Maps into Plone.   It is called Products.Maps. The use of the product is very straightforward.  It provides the following features:   	 Adds locations to a folder  	 Sets the view of the folder to Map  	 Figures out how to center and zoom the map automatically  	 Provides flexibility for enhancement by using the ZCA  	 Offers sane fallbacks when JavaScript is not available  	 Works on Collections  Additionally, Maps can read data from older Google Maps products:   	 Support for existing markers from qPloneGoogleMaps  	 Support for content that has a location set with the geolocation product  [ 176 ]   Chapter 6  Installing and configuring Maps The product is available as egg on PyPi  http:  pypi.python.org pypi  Products.Maps   and is installed by adding the product to the buildout. We don't  need to add the ZCML slot because the product is in the Products namespace  and therefore doesn't need it. The configure.zcml file of the product is included  automatically.  After installing the product as an add-on product, it shows up as Maps in the control  panel. There we enter our Google Maps API key. Two keys  localhost:8080 and  testing:8080  are provided already. For some regions  UK and China , the location  search does not work  as of May 2007 . Therefore, the maker of the product has  added a workaround. In the cases where the location search is not available, the  AJAX Search API is used. To activate this feature we need an additional key for  the Google AJAX Search API. We can get one at http:  code.google.com apis  ajaxsearch signup.html.   On setting API keys Google Maps API keys are issued for domains. If signing up for a Google  Maps API key, you can and should! strip the subdomain from the domain  URL the key is for. For example, if you want to include a Google Map into  your site http:  www.example.org, request an API key for http:   example.org. In the Maps configuration in Plone, you need to specify  the actual domain name s  on which the site is deployed  http:   www.example.org in our case . Note that the keys get rendered via the  JavaScript resource registry and are cached rather long. Turn off caching  in your browser if you are testing changed and or new keys. If you have  a map on your site that sees much traffic, then you may want to register  another key for its URL. This makes sure you are nice to Google and the  volume limits from Google Maps are spread out a bit.   Two more options can be configured:   	   Standard Map View: Google provides three different map views:  	  	  	   Schematic map Satellite images Satellite images with semantic overlay  This is a mixture of  the two previous ones.   The user can change the view anytime. This option defines the standard view  when the content loads. Schematic map is the default value for this option.  [ 177 ]   Content Control   	 Default coordinates: If creating new location content, these coordinates are   used as the default position to start with. The default value is  0.0, 0.0  for  this option. This location is a rather pointless position in the Atlantic Ocean  on the equator and the prime longitude that passes through Greenwich.  All the options are stored as normal properties in the portal_properties in Plone.  If we want, we can modify them via the ZMI directly. The property sheet is called  maps_properties.  Using the Maps product Now we are ready to add some location content. Maps come with a content type  Location. A location has similar fields to a document. It has a title, a description, and  a richtext field. Unique to the Location content type are the location and the marker  field. Internally, the location field is a tuple of two floating-point numbers storing the  coordinates of the location. If Google Maps is configured right, we see a small search  field and a map focusing on the default coordinates we specified in the control panel.  We can search for a location or move to it on the map. With the controls on the left  side, the map can be zoomed in and out and moved in the four directions:   	 Up: North  	 Down: South  	 Left: West  	 Right: East  On the right side, we have three buttons for selecting the layout of the actual map.  The options are Map, Satellite, and Hybrid and correspond to the ones for selecting  the standard view of all site maps. The standard view of a Location object looks like  the following screenshot:   [ 178 ]   Chapter 6  The Maps product comes with another goodie. We assume we have a folderish  object—a folder, large folder, or a collection with a bunch of Locations. "Maps"  provides a special folder view for these scenarios, maps_map. We can select it  from the display menu of a folder. It is indicated with Map view there. What we get is a map containing all the markers set in the locations in the folder.   The view does not recurse into a deeper structure, but displays only Locations  directly contained by the folder.  What we have seen now is the use of Location objects and the collection of them in  folderish structures. In the introduction to this part, we talked about geotagging  arbitrary content. Multimedia content in Plone is commonly stored as File content  type. In the next part, we will see how to extend Maps to geolocate the standard File  content type of Plone.  [ 179 ]   Content Control Extending the Maps product Because of its component architecture, Maps is easily extensible. Together with  the archetypes.schemaextender  http:  pypi.python.org pypi archetypes. schemaextender , we can add geolocation features to every arbitrary content type.  archetypes.schemaextender is a very useful developer addition for Plone. It  allows adding custom fields to literally any content type. It works with the ZCA   and the additional fields are annotated to the existing content type classes. Let's   see an example:  First, we define the adapter for extending the File content type. The adapter is for   the ISchemaExtender interface, which we define in the factory and which adapts  the IATFile interface.     Next, we need an adapter for the IMap interface. This interface allows the inclusion  of the necessary JavaScript libraries from Google.  <adapter     for="Products.ATContentTypes.interface.IATFile"     factory="Products.Maps.adapters.ContextMap"      >  Finally, we need to enable the ATFile class of ATContentTypes. We do so by  letting it implement the IMapEnabled interface from Maps.          <implements           interface="Products.Maps.interfaces.IMapEnabled"  >      That's all we need in ZCML. Next, we define our components in the Python   module geolocate: We import stuff from the component architecture, the IATFile interface, and some  classes and interfaces we need from archetypes.schemaextender and from Maps.  from zope.component import adapts from zope.interface import implements  from Products.ATContentTypes.interface import IATFile  from archetypes.schemaextender.field import ExtensionField from archetypes.schemaextender.interfaces import ISchemaExtender  from Products.Maps.field import LocationField, LocationWidget from Products.Maps.interfaces import IGeoLocation, IMap  [ 180 ]   First, we define a custom field for adding a location field to the File content type. The  field itself is an unmodified LocationField. To make it usable with archetypes. schemaextender, we have to mix in the ExtensionField class. The order is  important here. We need to make sure the ExtensionField class comes before! any  other parent class because it patches methods defined in Archetype fields.  Chapter 6  class MyLocationField ExtensionField, LocationField :     """ A location field usable with archetypes.schemaextender      """  Finally, we define our extender adapter. It is a simple object adapting and  implementing the necessary interfaces as previously said in the ZCML part.  class FileExtender object :     """ Extend file content type with location field """      adapts IATFile      implements ISchemaExtender   This is probably the most interesting part. Here we add the field to the adapter. As in  a normal schema, we have the field with a name, a widget, and probably some more  options such as languageIndependent or required, which are omitted here for  reasons of simplicity.   Note that the field is named like the location field in the Location content  type. This allows us to reuse the IMap adapter.      fields = [             MyLocationField "geolocation",             widget = LocationWidget label="Location of File"               ]  These methods are necessary to make the extender adapter actually work.      def __init__ self, context :         self.context = context      def getFields self :         return self.fields  Now we have everything in place for a geolocation-enhanced file. Adding a new file  renders a location field together with the input form just as for the Location content  type. We could go further and add a marker color field or more specialized fields  with this method. We stop here and leave this as an exercise for the reader.  There are some extension products using the functionality of Maps. Namely, there is  redturtle.maps.portlet, which renders a location  map  in a portlet.  [ 181 ]   Content Control  Licensing content in Plone Especially for multimedia, content licensing is a very important topic. If content  is exposed to other people via the Internet or any other distribution channels,   there is some kind of license associated to it. It is normally not a problem to use   this content for private purposes if it is publicly available and fetched legally.  Licensing gets important if content is to be used commercially, or if modified   content gets re-released.  To manage content licenses with Plone, we need an extension product called  collective.contentlicensing. The product is available on PyPi  http:  pypi.python. org pypi collective.contentlicensing  and installed by adding the egg and  ZCML slot to our buildout and installing Content Licensing as an add-on product. Doing so enables a Content Licensing slot in the Plone control panel, which is  reachable by calling the @@prefs_content_licensing page on the site. On the  configuration screen we can set the Jurisdiction, which is the country in which  the content license is valid. While the Publisher is for metadata purposes and not  displayed anywhere, the Default Copyright and the Default Copyright Holder are  used to render a footer line for every content item. It is possible to choose one of the  Supported Licenses for every content item, and the Default License is chosen if no  other license is specified. We can see the Content Licensing Settings page in the following screenshot:  [ 182 ]   Chapter 6  The standard installation comes with the predefined license templates All Rights  Reserved, the GNU Free Documentation License, and all variants of the Creative  Commons Licenses.  More information on these licenses can be found in Appendix A.  If these licenses do not match our needs, we may add additional ones. There is a  New License tab on the configuration screen for this purpose. A license has a Name,  a Location, and an Icon. Location and Icon are a URL pointing to the full text of the  license and an image, which is displayed in the license footer together with the  content object.  [ 183 ]   Content Control  With the current version of collective.contentlicensing, it is not  possible to delete licenses. So be careful when creating licenses. The only  thing you could do with unwanted or erroneous licenses is to hide them if  you uncheck the Supported Licenses field.  After customizing collective.contentlicensing to our needs, it is ready  for use. The product adds two additional fields on every content object marked  as collective.contentlicensing.DublinCoreExtensions.interfaces. ILicensable under the Ownership tab. The product itself marks the content types  Document, File, Image, and Folder with this interface. These two fields are Copyright  Holder and Copyright license. Copyright Holder defaults to " site default ", which is  the value we specified in the Publisher field on the configuration page. The Copyright license field lets us choose one of the Supported Licenses. All  together, this renders a footer line on the default view for our content. It does so by  overriding the default views of Document, File, Image, and Folder. The footer line  is rendered with the views copyright_byline_view and citation_view. A license  footer with the Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 attached  which allows doing  practically everything with the work as long as the creator is named  looks like this:  The footer contains two links. The second link points to the fulltext of the license,  which is on the Creative Commons site in this case. The URL depends on the  jurisdiction we chose in the settings before. The first link shows a JavaScript   popup including a copyable line of text, which looks like this:   tom.  2009, October 13 . Please reuse and modify!. Retrieved October 13, 2009,   from Site Web site: http:  localhost:8080 site please-reuse-and-modify. It includes information about who created the document and when, the title of the  document, and when and from which URL it was retrieved. This line is in the APA  format and may be important if the content needs to be cited.  [ 184 ]   If we want to include the licensing information in our custom templates, we include  the following HTML snippet into the template:  <div tal:replace="structure context @@copyright_byline_view  nothing"   >    Chapter 6  Summary This chapter was all about controlling content. If the amount of content grows, we  need measures to control and structure our content to keep an overview.  In the first part of the chapter, we investigated classical categorization methods. We  saw how content is structured with folders in Plone and how we can use Collections  and Content Rules to make this process more flexible. In the practical part, we  extended Collections with custom catalog data.  We learned about the Dublin Core, a standard set of metadata, which can be attached   on most types of content and is part of standard Plone. It can be set by the editor   on every content object and is exposed via the metatags in HTML.  Additionally, we glanced at some products that ease or extend the categorization  methods of the default Plone CMS.  The second part of the chapter was dedicated to the important technique of tagging  and rating. We compared some products providing this form of content control and  extended the rating product to our custom needs by building a seven-star rating.  In the final third part, we inspected two more means of content control. One is  geolocation and the other is licensing. We tested the features of the geolocation  product for Plone  Maps , which interacts with the Google Maps API. And we  enhanced the standard File content type of Plone with the help of Maps and  archetypes.schemaextender with additional location data. Lastly, we talked about  licenses and how to manage them with Plone and attach them to CMS content.  [ 185 ]    Content Syndication  At this stage of our book we have all the content in place. We know how to set up  nice image galleries, store audio and video content, and we have learned how to  structure this content in the CMS. But we still want more! Everybody is talking  about podcasting nowadays, which has something to do with multimedia. What is it  exactly and can we do it with Plone? Yes, we can!  In this chapter we will take a closer look at syndication. Syndication is an umbrella  term for podcasting, vodcasting, and so on. We will see what these terms mean and  how they are connected to each other. There are several formats that can be used for  distributing content, the most common being RSS and Atom. Besides these, there are  alternative ones such as OPML, MediaRSS, and GeoRSS.  What we will see is how to distribute content from Plone by means of syndication.  As a first step, we will look what Plone has to offer out of the box. Later, we will  investigate some third-party products that allow a richer syndication experience   with Plone. These products are fatsyndication and Vice. First, we will use these  products as an addition to Plone and as a second step we will extend Vice with  custom functionality.  In the last part of the chapter, we will glance at the syndication extras of the  Plone4Artists products. We looked at these products in the first part of this book  where we investigated content extensions for the Plone content types. It is possible  to use these products for podcasting and vodcasting solutions for content that can  be managed with Plone easily. This part acts as an example on how to extend the  fatsyndication product too.   Content Syndication  Here is a list of the topics covered in this chapter. We will:   	 Define the key terms syndication, podcast, and vodcast  	  Investigate the most important syndication formats: RSS, Atom, RDF, OPML,  MediaRSS, and GeoRSS   	 Use Plone's collections and searches for content syndication  	 Extend the Plone syndication features with the Vice add-on  	 Develop custom syndication features with the fatsyndication add-on  What is Syndication? The term syndication is used seldom. More popular terms for syndication techniques  are podcasting and vodcasting. These techniques have two things in common:  syndication and aggregation. The process publishing of specially prepared  multimedia  content to a client is  called syndication. The client is updated automatically with the newest information  without manual interaction. This client-side process is called aggregation.  The production and distribution of media data  audio or video  over the Internet  is called podcasting. The term is constructed from the two words iPod and  broadcasting. A single podcast is a series of media episodes, aggregated and  distributed via a feed.  Syndication formats For exchanging information with syndication, special formats are needed. These  formats commonly store the metadata of the multimedia—information about  the data and not the actual data itself. For an audio podcast they store its title,  description, and the link to the sound file, but not the file itself. An aggregator  reads and presents the metadata, and is able to download and play the audio file.  Unfortunately, there is not just a single syndication format; there are several different  ones. And that's not enough. These different formats are incompatible with each  other. They all utilize XML as the description language, but the tags used by the  individual dialects and their meaning differ substantially. The most important  syndication formats are RSS and Atom.  [ 188 ]   The RSS syndication format RSS is probably the most popular syndication format. Many weblogs make content  available via RSS. What the abbreviation means depends on the version:  Chapter 7   	 Rich Site Summary  RSS versions 0.9x   	 RDF Site Summary  RSS versions 0.9 and 1.0   	 Really Simple Syndication in RSS 2.0  The extension for RSS files is .rss or .xml and the MIME type is application  rss+xml.  Pretty much anything that can be broken down into discrete items can be syndicated  via RSS—the "recent changes" page of a wiki, a changelog of checkins to a versioning  tool, or the revision history of a book. To have a little insight on the confusing history  of RSS and the strange version numbering here is a little history of the RSS format  found on http:  www.xml.com pub a 2002 12 18 dive-into-xml.html:  The name "RSS" is an umbrella term for a format that spans several different  versions of at least two different  but parallel  formats. The original RSS, version  0.90, was designed by Netscape as a format for building portals of headlines to  mainstream news sites. It was deemed overly complex for its goals; a simpler  version, 0.91, was proposed and subsequently dropped when Netscape lost interest  in the portal-making business. UserLand Software, which intended to use it as the  basis of its weblogging products and other web-based writing software, picked up  0.91.  In the meantime, a third, non-commercial group split off and designed a new  format based on what they perceived as the original guiding principles of RSS 0.90   before it got simplified into 0.91 . This format, which is based on RDF, is called  RSS 1.0. But UserLand was not involved in designing this new format, and, as  an advocate of simplifying 0.90, it was not happy when RSS 1.0 was announced.  Instead of accepting RSS 1.0, UserLand continued to evolve the 0.9x branch,  through versions 0.92, 0.93, 0.94, and finally 2.0.  [ 189 ]   Content Syndication  If we count the number of all the formats and subformats mentioned, we get an  impressive number of seven different formats, all called "RSS". Today most sites  using RSS provide version 2.0 of the format. Plone itself uses RSS 1.0 for its out of the  box syndication. If we want to distribute multimedia content, we have to stick to RSS  2.0. Luckily, we don't have to limit ourselves and choose one exclusive format we  want to provide. We may provide different formats for the same feed.  In Appendix B, you will find detailed information on the different variants  of RSS and decision guidelines as to which format to use in which case.  Now let's take a closer look at an RSS channel file  version 2.0 :             Multimedia feed            http:  www.multimedia-with-plone.com        Latest news for doing multimedia stuff with Plone.                             As said before, an RSS channel file that carries the metadata is an XML file. The  global tag is rss with the version as an attribute. Subordinate to the rss tag is a  single channel element that contains information about the channel  metadata  and  its contents. The channel has some required and some optional fields.  The following are the RSS channel tags:  Tag title link description item language docs  webMaster pubDate  Description The title of the channel, which contains the name URL of the website that provides this channel Summary of what the provider is Feed items The human language used for the text Where to find the doc for the format of the file,  may be Harvard E-mail address Publishing date  Required Yes Yes Yes Yes, at least one No No  No No  [ 190 ]   More about RSS tags and their usage can be found in Appendix B of this book.  An example RSS 2.0 feed displayed in Firefox looks as shown in the   following screenshot:  Chapter 7  As RSS is an XML format, it is stored as plain text and cannot include binary data  natively. To solve this issue for podcasts and vodcasts, the feed references the binary  data with so-called enclosures. These enclosures have been available since RSS 2.0.  Unlike e-mail attachments, enclosures are merely hyperlinks to files; the actual data  is not embedded into the feed. The support and implementation among aggregators  varies. Some clients understand the specified file format and automatically download  and display the content, whereas other clients provide a link to it or silently ignore it.  [ 191 ]   Content Syndication  In RSS 2.0, the syntax for the   element—an optional child of the    element—is as follows:  <enclosure url="http:  mysite.com audiostream.mp3"            length="123456789"            type="audio mpeg"  >  The value of the url attribute is a URL of a file, length is its size in bytes, and type  its MIME type. There may only be a single enclosure element per item.  Choosing a encoding format for enclosing files The encoding format of the enclosed files is not determined by the RSS  specification. Generally, we could use what we want. If we want to  reach a maximum audience for our multimedia data, we should choose  the MP3 format for our audio data and the MP4 format for our video  data. These formats are the native formats of iTunes. This proprietary  client is commonly used and very widespread. All other multimedia  syndication clients understand these formats too.  The Atom syndication format Generally speaking, the Atom Syndication Format  ASF  is an XML format for  platform-independent exchange of information. It is the aim of ASF to supersede the  RSS format and its incompatibilities.  Atom was created out of a need to combine the advantages of the different   RSS formats in a new format and to add new elements. It was designed to fill   the needs of weblogs and news sites. The ASF format is specified in RFC 4287   http:  tools.ietf.org html rfc4287 . The filename extension for Atom files is either .atom or .xml and the MIME type is  application atom+xml.  An example ASF file looks like this:                  Example Feed      A subtitle.                urn:uuid:60a76c80-d399-11d9-b91C-0003939e0af6      2003-12-13T18:30:02Z        [ 192 ]   Chapter 7         John Doe         johndoe@example.com                          Atom-Powered Robots Run Amok                 urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a         2003-12-13T18:30:02Z         Some text.           The file has a default XML header with the version of XML and the file encoding.  Instead of the channel tag that RSS uses, ASF has a feed tag enclosing the metadata  provided by an entry. More detailed information on ASF can be found in Appendix B.  Other syndication formats While RSS and Atom are the top dogs among the syndication formats currently used  in the Internet, there are some other formats available for syndication. Some formats  are designed for special purpose syndication and some others try to work around  shortcomings in the two major formats. RDF—The Resource Description Framework RDF stands for Resource Description Format and is an XML dialect too. It is a  semantic web standard language ideal for describing real-world objects related to  unique identifiers  URIs . Computers and software can consume RDF data resources   that is it is machine readable . The idea behind it is that every website can create  RDF resources for all the information on the website and make them available as  RDF feeds. Any other websites, if interested, can then acquire the data from the RDF  feeds and integrate them with other data obtained in the same fashion. The whole  thing is called the "web of data" or semantic web. The MIME type for RDF files is application rdf+xml and its filename extension is  either .xml or .rdf.  [ 193 ]   Content Syndication  Although these are high-flying visions, it is possible to use RDF feeds now. An  example feed looks like the following:     <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http:  www.w3.org 1999 02 22-rdf-syntax-ns"                    xmlns:dc="http:  purl.org dc elements 1.1 ">      <rdf:Description rdf:about="http:  de.wikipedia.org wiki                                 Resource_Description_Framework">           Resource Description Framework               Wikipedia - Die freie Enzyklopädie           OPML—The Outline Processor Markup Language OPML  Outline Processor Markup Language  is an XML format for outlines. Radio  UserLand originally developed it for an outline application. Meanwhile many users  adopted it for syndication purposes.  The OPML specification defines an outline as a hierarchical ordered list of   arbitrary elements. The specification is fairly open, which makes it suitable for many  types of list data.  The filename extension for OPML files is .opml and the MIME type is one of  application xml, text xml, and text x-opml.  An example playlist coded in OPML looks like this:                playlist.xml     Thu, 27 Jul 2000 03:24:18 GMT     Fri, 15 Sep 2000 09:01:23 GMT     Dave Winer     dave@userland.com     1,3,17     1     164     50     672     455        [ 194 ]   Chapter 7          <outline text="I've started to note the songs I was listening to                      as I was writing DaveNet pieces.

Like standard HTML, OPML is split  into a head, and a body section. The head section is used for general information  such as the title of the feed, its date, and owner. The body section takes the actual  information, which is an MP3 playlist in our example case. Extending RSS with GeoRSS The GeoRSS format is not a separate format, but an extension for other formats.  It is designed to include geographical information. In GeoRSS, location content  consists of geographical points, lines, and polygons of interest and related feature  description. It can be consumed by geographic software such as map generators.  There are two variants of the GeoRSS format, GML  Geography Markup Language   and GeoRSS Simple. An example using the Atom base format and the lightweight  GeoRSS Simple looks like this:    <feed xmlns="http:  www.w3.org 2005 Atom"                    xmlns:georss="http:  www.georss.org georss">         Earthquakes     Int. earthquake observation labs   [ 195 ]   Content Syndication         2005-12-13T18:30:02Z           Dr. Thaddeus Remor               tremor@quakelab.edu         urn:uuid:60a76c80-d399-11d9-b93C-0003939e0af6               M 3.2, Mona Passage                    urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a               2005-08-17T07:02:32Z       We just had a big one.              45.256 -71.92          The namespace for GeoRSS is defined as http:  www.georss.org georss. In  our example we use a geographical point to represent the center of an earthquake.  The point is represented by its longitude and latitude separated by a space. See the  previous Chapter 6, Content Control for more information on geolocating content. Extending RSS with MediaRSS The standard feeding protocols Atom and RSS only support a very limited number  of tags for enclosing multimedia information. This is because they are meant to be  generic and need to support a lot of use cases. There are special needs for a feed with  dedicated multimedia content. Luckily, there is a format that satisfies these needs— MediaRSS. Like GeoRSS, MediaRSS is just an extension to the main feed formats and  not a format on its own. It defines it own XML namespace, http:  search.yahoo. com mrss . The namespace already reveals the creator of this format, Yahoo!. They  worked together with the MediaRSS community to enhance the media enclosure  available in Atom and RSS 2.0.  A movie review with a trailer using MediaRSS looks like this:  <rss version="2.0"     xmlns:media="http:  search.yahoo.com mrss "          My Movie Review Site       http:  www.moviesite.com       I review movies.               Movie Title: Is this a good movie?         http:  www.foo.com item1.htm   [ 196 ]   Chapter 7        <media:content           url="http:  www.moviesite.com trailer.mov"            fileSize="12216320" type="video quicktime"            expression="sample" >        nonadult               Unlike the enclosure of RSS 2.0, MediaRSS supports several multimedia links in  one entry. It supports attaching licensing information and several other goodies. A  detailed description of the format can be found in Appendix B.   Autodiscovery A feed is usually packed in XML and it has its own URL. From this perspective it is  very similar to a standard web page, which is written in  X HTML  an XML dialect   and has a URL too. Often a feed is only an additional view on the content presented  in the Web. We might want to link the feed from our web page prepared for the  browser. There is a solution for this use case. It is possible to include a link tag into a  web page to refer to the alternative feed representation of the content.  The tag looks like this if we want to refer to an RSS feed:  <link rel="alternate"              href="http:  www.mysite.com feed RSS"              title="RSS 1.0"        type="application rss+xml"  >    For an Atom feed, the alternate link looks like this:  <link rel="alternate"       href="atom rss-legacy-plone"       title="My ATOM Feed"       type="application atom+xml"  >  These links are called autodiscovery elements. They are optional, but need to be set  in the head section of the  X HTML document if used. The rel attribute is obligatory  and must contain the alternate keyword. The type attribute is obligatory as well  and takes the format of the feed. The href attribute must be present and takes a  URL, which may be absolute or relative. The title attribute is optional, but is  strongly recommended.  [ 197 ]   Content Syndication  Syndication clients For actually using the feed we need a client. We have a lot of choices. The most  prominent member is probably iTunes for being the eponym of the name podcast.  iTunes is an umbrella term for a software and a web store. It is the software we   refer to when talking about syndication clients. iTunes is available on Mac and  Windows systems, and understands the .m4a, .mp3, .mov, .mp4, .m4v, and .pdf  multimedia formats. A very good client, especially for vodcasts, is Miro  http:  www.getmiro.com  .  Miro comes with a video player, a search engine for free podcasts and vodcasts, and  manages multiple feeds in a sophisticated way. The software is available on Linux,  Mac, and Windows and can be used as torrent client additionally.  Some mail clients  such as Thunderbird  support reading of feeds, but don't support  viewing videos or listening to audios. On Linux, there are dedicated syndication  clients for the desktop software GNOME  Liferea  http:  liferea.sourceforge. net index.htm   and KDE  akregator  http:  userbase.kde.org Akregator  .  Another approach is using web-based syndication clients such as Netvibes  http:   www.netvibes.com   or pageflakes  http:  www.pageflakes.com  . With these  sites, we can collect our feeds on a customizable dashboard. All the feeds are listed  there and the content  audios, videos, images, and documents  is directly linked and  shown in the browser.  Syndication features of Plone Plone comes with RSS 1.0  with some RDF additions  support out of the box. It  allows feeding two components—collections and searches. In every Plone site, there  is a tool for syndication—the "Plone Syndication Tool" at portal_syndication. The portal_syndication allows the site-wide configuration of syndication  for collections  or folder-like objects implementing the Products.CMFCore. interfaces.ISyndicatable interface . It is possible to:   	 Enable disable site-wide syndication  	 Set syndication defaults on the properties management form in the ZMI  Once site-wide syndication is enabled, the syndication action on collections is  activated, allowing tuning the syndication for specific collections. Once a collection  object is created, a syndication_information object is put inside the folder,  which acts as a property sheet for overriding sitewide defaults for each particular  syndication instance.  [ 198 ]   The site-wide configuration of the portal_syndication is done in its property  management form in the ZMI. There is a button allowing turning the syndication   on and off. If it is turned on, there are four properties that can be set:  Chapter 7  Property UpdatePeriod  Default daily  UpdateFrequency  1  UpdateBase  <current  time>  Max Items  15  Description Describes the period over which the channel  format is updated. Acceptable values are hourly,  daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly. Used to describe the frequency of updates  in relation to the update period. A positive  integer indicates how many times in  that period the channel is updated. For  example, an UpdatePeriod of daily and an  UpdateFrequency of 2 indicate the channel  format is updated twice daily. If omitted, a value  of 1 is assumed. Defines a base date to be used in connection with  the UpdatePeriod and UpdateFrequency  values to calculate the publishing schedule. By  default, the site-wide date is the date and time of  the tool initialization. The date format takes the  form: yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm. Defines the maximum number of items that  are included in a feed. The RSS Specification  recommends this not to exceed 15.  If we have a folderish content object that has a synContentValues method   ISyndicatable interface , we can turn on syndication by callingit with the  following lines.  >>> syn_tool = getToolByName context, 'portal_syndication'  >>> if  syn_tool.isSiteSyndicationAllowed   and not  ...    syn_tool.isSyndicationAllowed context  : ...    syn_tool.enableSyndication context   If it is an Archetype content object, this can be done in the initializeArchetype  method as the topic content type does it.  See Products.ATContentTypes.content. topic.py for an example.   [ 199 ]   Content Syndication  Using Collections for syndication Collections are folderish content objects in Plone. They are something called saved  searches that may change their content automatically if other content in the site is  created, deleted, or modified.  A detailed introduction on Collections is in Chapter 6.  For that reason, Collections are perfect candidates for syndication feeds. We don't  have to do anything special to prepare Collections for syndication. It is done  automatically. For an RSS feed of a Collection, we add RSS to the URL of the  Collection. To call a feed of a Collection named news-items located directly on  the site, we use the following URL:  http:  localhost:8080 site news-items RSS  This view is exposed via a document action. This action is only displayed if  syndication is allowed for the site and for the specific Collection. Additionally,   the autodiscovery link for RSS is rendered into the standard view for Collections. All the portal_syndication properties can be overridden on any collection.  To do so, we call the synPropertiesForm view on the collection:  [ 200 ]   Chapter 7  [ 201 ]   Content Syndication  There is a documentation bug in the Update Frequency description. As  in the default configuration for syndication, a positive integer needs to  be entered here. If you specify weekly in Update Period and 2 in Update  Frequency, the feed is updated twice a week.  Normally, a collection feed does not include the body text of the item. If we want to  include it, we have to customize the rss_template in plone_templates.  After the line    Description      we add the following snippet:  <content:encoded xmlns:content="http:  purl.org rss 1.0 modules  content "         tal:define="text obj_item getTextnothing;                 full request fullnothing"     tal:condition="python: text and full"           tal:content="structure python:                    '&lt;![CDATA[' + obj_item.getText   + ']]&gt;' ">    This includes the full text if the feed is called with full in the query string. Here is  an example:  http:  localhost:8080 site news-items RSS?full=1  Feeding a search Another way Plone makes use of RSS feeds is with searches. Normally, a search  is called with the search form. This form displays a fulltext input field on top  of the page and the search results below. The search view is called with query  string options passed through to the catalog. It can be called from several sources,  including the search portlet, the quick search, or the advanced search. The search view can be easily replaced with the search_rss view, which returns  the results as an RSS feed. Naturally, the feed comes without an input widget. An  autodiscovery link to the feed is included in the search view. If the client browser  supports feeds, it renders a corresponding icon in the address bar. The patch of the rss_template shown in the previous part works for this feed too,  because it uses the same base template for rendering the feed.  [ 202 ]   Chapter 7  Syndication products for Plone The standard syndication format of Plone is RSS 1.0 that uses XML and RDF  for feeding the data. As indicated earlier in this chapter, there are other   incompatible formats and the richer Atom format ASF. For the syndication of  multimedia content, the templates Plone provides are not sufficient. They were  developed mainly for textual content. If we want to provide different formats or  extend the existing one, we have two options. Either we procure the two existing  page templates rss_template and RSS, or we rely on third-party products. We can  choose between two add-ons. One is fatsyndication, which is the older product and  developed in the context of Quills—the weblog add-on for Plone. fatsyndication is  targeted at developers who want to extend the syndication features of Plone. It does  not provide its own UI.  The other product, which is actually a bundle, is called Vice. The Plone-specific parts  are implemented in the vice.outbound.plone package. Vice comes with a UI and is  targeted at both developers and end users. It comes with an API to extend syndication  and it has its own UI included that is meant to replace the existing one in Plone.  The fatsyndication product bundle The product fatsyndication is a pluggable solution for adding arbitrary syndication  formats to Plone. As it builds on top of the ZCA, it is very flexible, and easily  customizable and extensible. The whole product is split into two packages:  Products.basesyndication and Products.fatsyndication.  The basesyndication product In basesyndication, all of the interfaces are provided and the browser templates for  the following feed formats are defined:   	 RSS  version 2.0   	 Atom  	 RDF  version 1.0   	 RDF  version 1.1   	  iTunes  [ 203 ]   Content Syndication  For later use in the fatsyndication product and in custom components, the following  important interfaces are included:  class IEnclosure Interface :      """... """      def getURL  :         """ URL of the enclosed file. """      def getLength  :         """ Return the size length of the enclosed file. """         def __len__  :         """ Synonym for getLength. """      def getMajorType  :         """ Return the major content type of the enclosed             file.              e.g. content type = 'text plain' would              return 'text'.         """       def getMinorType  :         """ Return the minor content type of the enclosed              file. e.g. content type = 'text plain' would              return 'plain'.         """      def getType  :         """ Return the content type of the enclosed file. """  This interface is important for feeding binary content. This is the case almost any  time when working with multimedia. We have binary audio, video, image, and PDF  data. This data stored in Archetypes needs to be wrapped with the IEnclosure  interface so it is understood by the feeding mechanism of fatsyndication.  class IFeedEntry Interface :     """ A single syndication feed entry. """      def getWebURL  :         """ URL for the web view of this IFeedEntry. """         def getTitle  :         """Title of this entry. """      def getDescription  :         """Description of this entry. """  [ 204 ]   Chapter 7      def getBody  :         """The raw body content of this entry. """      def getXhtml  :         """ The  x html body content of this entry,             or None """      def getUID  :         """Unique ID for this entry. ... """  ...      def getEnclosure  :         """ Return an IEnclosure instance             or None.         """  An IFeedEntry interface corresponds with a document in the terminology of  Archetypes and an item element in the terminology of RSS. It is responsible for  transporting all the metadata of the context into the feed. Besides methods getting  the title and the description, the interface also defines methods for collecting the  author, the associated tags, and the enclosure. This method returns an object  implementing IEnclosure, if available, or none otherwise. In an Archetype context,  the getUID method fetches the UID from the reference catalog.  Let's assume that we have a container with ATDocuments. For syndication, each  document would be wrapped with an adapter providing the IFeedEntry interface.  The container itself needs to implement the IFeedSource interface:  class IFeedSource Interface :     """A source of IFeedEntry objects for a feed.  """       def getFeedEntries max_only=True :         """ A sequence of IFeedEntry objects. ... """      def getMaxEntries  :         """ Maximum number of IFeedEntries to show for             this feed. """  The IFeedSource interface can be seen as a marker adapter for the syndication data  provider. In Plone, this usually is a folder or collection but is not limited to that. It  could be a web service  such as SOAP  to fetch data from a different system. Finally, there is the IFeed interface:  class IFeed Interface :     """A syndication feed e.g. RSS, atom, etc. """  [ 205 ]   Content Syndication      def getUpdatePeriod  :         """          """       def getUpdateFrequency  :         """          """      def getImageURL  :         """ URL of an image that can be embedded in feeds.                     """      def getEncoding  :         """Character encoding for the feed. """       def getUID  :         """Unique ID for this feed.  """      def getWebURL  :                   """URL for the web view of this feed.  """      def getFeedSources  :         """A sequence of IFeedSource objects. """      def getFeedEntries max_only=True :        """ Return a sequence of IFeedEntry objects with which                 to build a feed.

"""      def getModifiedDate max_only=True :         """ The last modified datetime that applies to the                  whole feed.         """  The IFeed interface represents a whole feed. A feed is a list of feed entries  objects  implementing IFeedEntry  together with its configuration settings. Usually, the  interface is used for an adapter on a folderish object in Plone. The update properties  are taken from portal_syndication. This is the standard behavior of Plone. Most  of the other methods return properties of the adapted container in the default  implementation. For convenience purposes, there is a base class provided for custom  feeds. The class is fatysndication.adapters.feed.BaseFeed.  [ 206 ]   Chapter 7  The fatsyndication product Why is the product "FAT"? "F" stands for Five and "AT" for Archetypes. The  fatsyndictation product defines basic adapters and views for the use with customized  syndication components. It only comes with an IFeedEntry adapter for CMF  documents, mainly meant as an example.  If we want to syndicate other Plone components or our own, we have to follow   these steps:  1.  We declare adapters to IFeedEntry from those interfaces that we want  to appear in our syndication feeds. Commonly, this is the interface of an  Archetype content type or a marker for certain content objects.  2.  We declare adapters to IFeedSource from those  probably containerish    interfaces that we wish to supply the IFeedEntry instances to an IFeed. This  is a very simple interface to implement. All we need to do is return a list of  items implementing IFeedEntry in the getFeedEntries method.  3.  We declare adapters to IFeed from those interfaces that we wish to have  syndication feeds for. Normally, this is a container of Archetype content.  4.  We declare adapters to the IFeedSource interface. In most cases these   components will adapt to folderish content objects of Plone. They are the  actual data supplier for an IFeed and return a list of items implementing  IFeedEntry in the getFeedEntries method.  You will find examples in the syndication.py and syndication. zcml files from the quills.app package  in the Collective ,  http:   svn.plone.org svn collective quills.app  , and in the p4a. ploneaudio p4a.plonevideo packages. The syndication components  of the p4a.plonevideo package are covered at the end of this chapter.  Syndication with Vice In 2007, Plone sponsored a GSoC  Google Summer of Code  project to enhance its  syndication story. The result was vice  http:  www.coactivate.org projects  vice  , a syndication bundle that supports Zope3, Zope2, and Plone. Unfortunately,  the project never released a final version, though there is a release candidate  available. The packages did not get much attention from the community. This is  wrong because the approach is well designed, very flexible through the component  architecture, and well tested.  [ 207 ]   Content Syndication  fatsyndication is a product aimed at developers and does not provide any features  to the Plone user. Unlike fatsyndication, Vice comes as a full replacement of the  syndication mechanism of Plone. It has its own views and it is possible to configure  the product through the control panel. The product is aimed at both the developer  and the end user. The whole bundle consists of three packages—vice.outbound,  vice.zope2.outbound, and vice.plone.outbound.  To add Vice to our Plone site, we have to modify our buildout:  First, we have to add some additional eggs to the list of fake eggs that are already  available in the Zope2 bundle.  [zope2] recipe = plone.recipe.zope2install fake-zope-eggs = true additional-fake-eggs =      zope.app.securitypolicy     zope.app.zcmlfiles     zope.app.catalog url = ${versions:zope2-url}  [instance] recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance ... eggs =     ...     vice.plone.outbound     zope.app.wsgi==3.4.0  zcml =     ...     vice.plone.outbound  In addition to adding the vice.plone.outbound egg and including its ZCML slug,  we have to include version 3.4.0 of the zope.app.wsgi egg. There is an explicit but  undeclared dependency on this version of the egg in vice.outbound, so we have to  include it here. After running the buildout, restarting the instance, and installing Outbound  Syndication  Vice  as an add-on, the product is ready to use. The first thing we want  to do is to configure the product. There is a global configuration available in the  control panel of Plone. It is labeled Outbound Syndication  Vice  as well and can be  called with the syndication-controlpanel view on the site directly:  [ 208 ]   Chapter 7  [ 209 ]   Content Syndication  The configuration screen contains the following options:  Option Enabled  Default Description False  Maximum Items  -1  With this flag we can turn on off the syndication for  the whole site. This field takes an integer value that specifies the  default maximum number of items for all the feeds.  This value can be overridden on any single feed. A  negative value implies no limit. Setting this Boolean flag to True enables publishing  URLs for feeds that differ from their actual URL. If this Boolean flag is set to True, the default behavior  for feeds is to descend into the folder structure when  aggregating the information for syndication. The value  can be overridden on any single feed. Enabling this option shows a content view action  "Syndication" on every folderish object that allows  syndication.  Enable Published  URLs Enable Recursion  True  True  Show feed  configuration  actions  False  The configuration screen comes with a Migrate button that migrates the default  syndication mechanism of Plone to Vice. Clicking the migrate button will migrate all  syndication_information objects to IFeedConfig adapters used by vice.plone. outbound. It does so by extracting the content from the object, storing this information  as an IFeedConfig adapter, and deleting the original syndication_information  object. It also replaces the default portal_syndication of Plone with the one  from Vice.  If we choose to show the feed configuration for folderish content objects, users with  the appropriate permission have an additional Syndication option in the object tabs.  Otherwise, the syndication configuration of single content objects needs to be called  with the configurefeeds view. In this screenshot, we see the configuration screen of a singule folder  a collection in  this case :  [ 210 ]   Chapter 7  Of course, we can turn on off syndication on any folder there. Each feed can be  configured with the following options:  Option Select  Description This is not a real configuration, but this option is used to mark a feed  for removal.  Auto Discover Adds an auto-discover link to the view of the folder. Enabled  Enables disables a feed.  [ 211 ]   Content Syndication  Option Name  Format  Recurse  Published  URL  Local URL  Description The name of the feed. This name is the last part of the feed URL. This  URL is constructed using the following schema: <URL of content  object>    .  For example, the  URL of the folder is http:  www.mysite.com feed. If we feed  the Atom format and the name is "news", the feed URL would be  http:  www.mysite.com feed atom news.  We may select one of the available formats. The package comes with  templates for Atom, RSS 1.0, and RSS 2.0. With this option, the global recurse setting can be overridden for any  individual feed. Every feed contains its URL. If we want to change it from the default  constructed one, we can do so with this field. This option is valid  only if published URLs are enabled globally in the Vice settings. This is not a setting but a display of the URL of the feed. It is  constructed as described at the Name field.  Feeds can be disabled and removed at any time. Enabled views appear in the  document actions viewlet and in the autodiscover section, if activated.  Extending Vice Vice can be extended in many ways. We can add custom feed formats, custom feeds  for collections of data  not to be mixed up with Plone's content type Collection! , and  we can create custom feed items for our own content types.  The feed formats are defined in the vocabulary "Feed Formats". The default vocabulary  is set in vice.outbound.feedformats.feedformats and contains Atom, RSS 1.0,  and RSS 2.0. If we want to add an additional feed format, we have to extend this  vocabulary. Furthermore, we need to provide a page template for our feed format. The two key interfaces for extension are IFeed and IFeedItem. IFeed represents an  entire feed and should be used to adapt a content item that can provide individual feed  entries; usually, this is a folderish object. IFeedItem represents an individual entry in  a feed. Any items that should be able to become entries in a feed must be adaptable to  IFeedItem. Another important interface is IFeedable, which is used to mark objects  of types that are capable of being configured as a feed. Thus, to enable a new IFeed  adapter, we must both declare the new IFeed adapter in ZCML and also use ZCML to  mark any objects to be adapted by the new IFeed adapter as IFeedable.  [ 212 ]   Chapter 7  Let's take an example. We will enhance the RSS 2.0 feed of Vice to include   MediaRSS information.   First, we need to add the MediaRSS format to the vocabulary of available formats.  The vocabulary is created from a global utility providing vice.outbound. feedformats.interfaces.IFeedFormats.  <utility   factory=".syndication.ExtFeedFormats"   provides="vice.outbound.feedformats.interfaces.IFeedFormats"    >  We define this utility with ZCML and create the corresponding factory. The ZCML  snippet from above is put in the overrides.zcml file to override the default utility  from Vice.  from vice.outbound.feedformats.feedformats import DefaultFeedFormats  class ExtFeedFormats DefaultFeedFormats :      format_tuples = DefaultFeedFormats.format_tuples + [          'MediaRSS', 'mediarss', 'vice-default',          'mediarss-enhanced',          'text xml', 'utf-8', 'application rss+xml', True ,     ]  For the factory, we mainly take the DefaultFeedFormats class from vice. outbound.feedformats.feedformats and add the tuple for MediaRSS. The tuple  consists of eight values with the following meaning:   	 Name: The name of the feed. It can be freely chosen and is MediaRSS in our    	 View: The name of the view that renders the feed. We use lowercase   example case.  mediarss for this.   	 Feed adapter name: Feeds are named adapters. With this value we can select  the name of the adapter, which should be used. The default is vice-default.  We keep that one. Item adapter name: Like feeds, items are named adapters as well. The  default name is vice-default too. We changed this to mediarss-enhanced  because we overoide the feed item adapter for files.   	   	 MIME type: The MIME type of the feed file itself. We almost never need to   change the default value text xml.   	 Encoding: The encoding of the feed. The default value is utf-8, which is   sufficient for most cases.  [ 213 ]   Content Syndication   	 Autodiscover type: This value is set as an attribute in the link tag if the feed   is set to be auto-discovered on a page. A sensible value is application  rss+xml here.   	 Visible: We use this flag for deciding if the feed should be exposed to the   format vocabulary. True makes the value available.  For the next step we define a template we want to use for our feed. We take the RSS  2.0 template of Vice as a basis. If we want to use the MediaRSS tags in our feed, we  have to add the corresponding namespace in the header.    <rss version="2.0" xmlns:media="http:  search.yahoo.com mrss "  We change the link of the feed itself to point to the mediarss view.       xmlns:tal="http:  xml.zope.org namespaces tal"      xmlns:i18n="http:  xml.zope.org namespaces i18n"      tal:define="feed view feed">                           <link tal:content="string:${feed context absolute_url}  mediarss ${feed config id}"  >  The next part is taken literally from the RSS 2.0 template:                               vice                                                             <guid tal:content="string:urn:syndication:                                     ${feedentry UID}">                                     <description tal:content="feedentry                                   description">description                                    <author tal:condition="feedentry author"                         tal:content="feedentry author">                                         tag                                                                            [ 214 ]   Chapter 7  Next, we remove the enclosure part from RSS 2.0 and add the richer MediaRSS  tags. Most values for the simple implementation can be fetched either from the feed  item or from the enclosure. We only show a very simple example here. The only  extension we use is the medium attribute for the media:content tag. We need to add  this attribute to the IFeedItem adapter later. Of course, we could use the complete  rich API from MediaRSS here. We could extend the file type with archetypes. schemaextender to include a thumbnail and use it in the feed. There are no limits  for the imagination.                  <media:content                      tal:define="enclosure feedentry enclosure"                     isDefault="True"                     tal:attributes="                         url enclosure URL;                         fileSize enclosure size;                         type enclosure mimeType;                      medium feedentry medium;">                                        <media:description tal:content="feedentry  description"  >                   Finally, we have to close the item tag.                 Next we register the view with ZCML. Format views are registered for the  IFeedable interface. The name of the view  mediarss  must correspond to the  view name we defined in the formats utility.  <browser:page       for="vice.outbound.interfaces.IFeedable"       name="mediarss"       class=".syndication.MediaRSS_FeedView"       permission="vice.ViewFeeds"  >  For the view class itself, we use the base class provided by Vice and include   our template.  class MediaRSS_FeedView FeedViewWithUrlIdBase :        template = ViewPageTemplateFile 'mediarss.pt'      def getTemplate self :         return self.template  [ 215 ]   Content Syndication  As the last step, we define an adapter for IFeedItem to be able to include the  medium information in our feed. We need to make sure the name of the adapter is  the same as we defined before in the formats utility, otherwise it won't be found. In  our feed, we only consider file content objects. All other content objects are ignored  because there is no named adapter defined for them.  <adapter       factory=".syndication.ATFileEnhancedFeedItem"       name="mediarss-enhanced"       trusted="true"  >         <require         permission="vice.ViewFeeds"         interface="vice.outbound.interfaces.IFeedItem"  >      The factory for the adapter is very simple:  class ATFileEnhancedFeedItem ATFileFeedItem :      def medium self :         return self.enclosure.mimeType.split ' ' [0]  For the medium information that we want to provide, we use the first part of   the MIME type. If the value is "audio" or "video", which is true in most cases,   it will work.  After creating a folder, adding some video content, and setting up the syndication  for it, we can subscribe to it. Let's assume we use Miro. In the sidebar menu, we  select the Add Feed option. In the text field, we copy the link to our MediaRSS  feed and that's it. A simple feed with two video items looks as shown in the  following screenshot:  [ 216 ]   Chapter 7  Syndication of Plone4Artists products If we use the Plone4Artists products introduced in the first part of this book, we  don't have to care about setting up syndication too much. These products come  with good support for syndication already built in. As backend, the fatsyndication  product is used; but it is not a hard dependency for installation. It has to be added   to the buildout manually. For creating a vodcast with p4a.plonevideo, we have to include the Products. fatsyndication egg in our buildout. We don't necessarily need to install the  product; it only needs to be available to our Zope2 instance.  [ 217 ]   Content Syndication  Now we remember the Video container subtype of folderish objects we studied in  Chapter 4. With fatsyndication installed, we see the RSS icon at the top right of the  content area. Unfortunately, there is no autodiscovery link exposed in the template.  The following syndication formats are available:   Format RSS 2.0 ATOM RDF RDF 1.1 iTunes  trunk-only   View name rss.xml atom.xml rdf.xml rdf11.xml itunes.xml  Let's look at the feed configuration for audio-enhanced folders and files. We have  two files that are responsible for the syndication setup—syndication.py and  syndication.zcml. Both files can be found in the p4a.plonevideo package.   The implementation for video and audio syndication in p4a. plonevideo and p4a.ploneaudio is almost identical. We will  see the video variant in the next part. Everything said about the  video implementation is true for the corresponding audio variant.  The first component needed is the feed itself. It implements the IFeed interface  from base syndication and adapts to the IVideoContainerEnhanced interface.  The component consists of a class  VideoContainerFeed  and the registration  in ZCML. The class inherits unmodified from the BaseFeed class from the  fatsyndication product.          class VideoContainerFeed fatadapters.BaseFeed :      interface.implements baseinterfaces.IFeed       component.adapts interfaces.IVideoContainerEnhanced                  <adapter       factory=".syndication.VideoContainerFeed"      provides="Products.basesyndication.interfaces.IFeed"  >            Another component is the IFeedSource adapter. It also adapts to the  IVideoContainerEnhanced interface. The adapter factory is taken unmodified  from the fatsyndication.adapters.BaseFeedSource class. One method, which  is provided additionally, is the getFeedEntries method. In the case of p4a. plonevideo, it collects all video objects of a video-enhanced container and returns  IFeedEntry adapters of these objects:  [ 218 ]   Chapter 7                          class VideoContainerFeedSource fatadapters.BaseFeedSource :      interface.implements baseinterfaces.IFeedSource       component.adapts interfaces.IVideoContainerEnhanced      def getFeedEntries self :          """See IFeedSoure          """          video_items =              interfaces.IVideoProvider self.context .video_items          return [baseinterfaces.IFeedEntry x.context                  for x in video_items]                         The IFeedEntry adapter has a video-enhanced file as its context. It is represented  as an item in the feed. One main purpose is to get the IEnclosure adapter of the  context.          class VideoFeedEntry fatadapters.BaseFeedEntry :      interface.implements baseinterfaces.IFeedEntry       component.adapts interfaces.IVideoEnhanced                           def __init__ self, *args, **kwargs :          fatadapters.BaseFeedEntry.__init__ self, *args, **kwargs            self.video = interfaces.IVideo self.context        def getBody self :         """See IFeedEntry.          """         return ''                                                                                          def getEnclosure self :          return baseinterfaces.IEnclosure self.context                  def getTitle self :          return self.video.title         [ 219 ]   Content Syndication  There are separate IFeed and IFeedSource adapters for enhanced videos. They are  basically the same as the corresponding adapters for the video enhanced container.  The only difference is that their context is a single enhanced file not an enhanced  container with a number of files.          class VideoFeed fatadapters.BaseFeed :      interface.implements baseinterfaces.IFeed       component.adapts interfaces.IVideoEnhanced               <adapter         factory=".syndication.VideoFeed"                  provides="Products.basesyndication.interfaces.IFeed"   >  class VideoFeedSource fatadapters.BaseFeedSource :      interface.implements baseinterfaces.IFeedSource       component.adapts interfaces.IVideoEnhanced       def getFeedEntries self :               """See IFeedSoure"""               return [baseinterfaces.IFeedEntry self.context ]     Finally, there is the IEnclosure adapter. Its purpose is to fill the values of the  enclosure section of the RSS feed. The context of the adapter is a video-enhanced file.  class ATFileEnclosure object :      interface.implements baseinterfaces.IEnclosure       component.adapts interfaces.IVideoEnhanced        def __init__ self, context :          self.context = context       def getURL self :          return self.context.absolute_url         def getLength self :          return self.context.getFile  .get_size         def __len__ self :          return self.getLength       [ 220 ]   Chapter 7     def getMajorType self :        return self.getType  .split ' ' [0]     def getMinorType self :        return self.getType  .split ' ' [1]      def getType self :        return self.context.getFile  .getContentType                 Additional to the adapters, we need views responsible for rendering the feeds. As  a view class, the GenericFeedView from the fatsyndication product can be reused.  This class takes care of collecting the feed elements and finding the right template  for a given format. For our custom implementation we allow the syndication  from all objects marked with one of the two interfaces, p4a.video.interfaces. IVideoContainerEnhanced and p4a.video.interfaces.IVideoEnhanced. All 5  predefined formats  atom, rdf, rdf11, rss, and itunes  are exposed via ZCML:  <browser:pages        for="p4a.video.interfaces.IVideoContainerEnhanced"   class="Products.fatsyndication.browser.feed.GenericFeedView"        permission="zope2.View">                                       <browser:pages        for="p4a.video.interfaces.IVideoEnhanced"   class="Products.fatsyndication.browser.feed.GenericFeedView"        permission="zope2.View">                                       [ 221 ]   Content Syndication  This customization of the fatsyndication product by the p4a.plonevideo  product is a complete example of how to create a custom feed with the help of   the fatsyndication product. It can be easily modified to the needs for our own   custom products.  To see the product in action, we can use the buildout provided in  Chapter 4. All we have to do is to add Products.fatsyndication  to the list of available eggs of the instance.  Summary This chapter was all about syndication. After defining what syndication is and how it  is linked with the terms podcasting and vodcasting, we investigated some common  syndication formats such as RSS, Atom, and MediaRSS. We introduced some clients,  which can be used to display syndication feeds.  We learned how to use RSS syndication with an unmodified Plone with Collections  and searches. As Plone uses the RSS 1.0 format for syndication, it is not capable of  feeding multimedia content. For this task we need add-ons, which we found in the  two products—Vice and fatsyndication.  We saw how to use these products to enhance the syndication features of Plone from  the integrator and from the developer perspective. We extended Vice to provide  some basic MediaRSS features. Lastly, we stepped through the syndication code of the p4a.plonevideo product.  We used this product in Chapter 4 to enhance the video features of Plone. The  product comes with syndication features as well, which are a good example of how  to extend and customize fatsyndication.  [ 222 ]   Advanced Upload Techniques  In the last chapter we analyzed methods to get data out of Plone. This chapter is  all about getting data into Plone. Until now we only used the standard UI of Plone  to upload our image, audio, and video content. The UI has two characteristics: The  whole process is handled by the web browser  through the Web , and only one item  is processed per operation. This is mainly because of the nature of the underlying  protocol—HTTP. For large amounts of data, this can be very cumbersome. Let's  imagine a huge picture gallery with dozens of pictures, which has to be uploaded for  a site launch within a week. We need a better solution than calling the createObject  view again and again for uploading all of the pictures one by one.  This chapter covers the following topics:   	 Uploading multiple files in one go with the add-on products, collective.  uploadify, PloneFlashUpload, and atreal.massloader Installing atreal.massloader on Mac OS X   	  	 Pushing data into Plone with FTP  	 Manipulating Plone content with WebDAV  Uploading strategies Plone offers two strategies for getting data into the database in an effective way.  One strategy is to use alternative upload protocols. Besides the HTTP protocol,  the Zope server supports the FTP and the WebDAV protocols. Both can be used  to upload data  with drag-and-drop! . The other strategy is to utilize Flash or file  bundles to achieve bulk uploads through the Web. For these methods, we need  add-on products providing the desired mechanism including a web UI for uploads.  Let's look at them first.   Advanced Upload Teachniques  Web-driven bulk uploads An easy way to upload multiple files in one go is to use an add-on product for Plone  supporting this. We have the choice between three of these products: collective. uploadify, PloneFlashUpload, and atreal.massloader. Each of these products  has a different strategy on how to get the data into Plone. Two of them use Flash  for posting the asynchronous data, and one uses ZIP storage for bundling the data  before uploading. What they have in common is that they all use the native web GUI.  Editors of the content don't have to change the client to upload binary data.   All actions can be done in the web browser with the familiar GUI of Plone.  Using collective.uploadify for web-based  multiupload The youngest member of the bulk upload products is collective.uploadify.  The product adds a very thin layer on top of the jQuery plugin called uploadify   http:  www.uploadify.com  . The method used for uploading is a mixture  between Flash and JavaScript  jQuery .  To use the product, it needs to be added to the buildout in the normal way. We add  the product name to the egg and the ZCML section of our instance part. There is  no need to install the product as an add-on product in Plone. It provides an upload  view for uploading multiple files and an upload_file view for a single file upload.  Note that if we have multiple Plone sites in one Zope instance, they all have  uploadify enabled. Of course, it is possible to expose the view s  with an action. This  can be done through the Web in the portal_actions by adding an action with the  following values set in the ZMI:   	 URL  Expression : string:${object_url} @@upload  	 Condition  Expression : python:portal.portal_workflow.  getInfoFor context, "review_state", default=""  == "published"  and plone_context_state.is_folderish    This exposes the upload view for folderish objects that are in the published  workflow state.  [ 224 ]   Chapter 8  It might be necessary to adjust the workflow state to a custom value  if you have a workflow other than the default folder_workflow  workflow attached to folders.  Or including the following actions.xml file can expose the view.

With this button we can add files to the upload  queue. The upload queue is below the button. It shows the name of the file, a  progress bar, and a red button to remove the item from the queue. If we have added  all our files to the queue and are feeling lucky, we will click on the Upload Files  button. This triggers the upload batch and the content creation in Plone.  [ 226 ]   collective.uploadify can be configured using simple properties. The following  settings can be done in the site_properties:   Chapter 8  Property ul_auto_upload  Type Boolean  Default False  ul_allow_multi  Boolean  False  ul_sim_upload_ limit ul_size_limit  Int  Int  4  empty  ul_file_ description  String  empty  ul_file_extensions String  *.*  ul_button_text  String  BROWSE  ul_button_image  String  empty  ul_hide_button  Boolean  False  Description Files are uploaded immediately  after they are selected if this is  set to True.

The list separator,  which has a format like  *.ext1;*.ext2;*.ext3.  ul_file_description,  is required when using this  option. This text appears as default on  the button for accessing the files  on the local disc. The path to the image that is  used for the browse button. A True value hides the browse  button image.

[ 227 ]   Advanced Upload Teachniques  Web-based multiuploads with  PloneFlashUpload A similar approach to collective.uploadify is PloneFlashUpload   http:  pypi.python.org pypi Products.PloneFlashUpload . While in  collective.uploadify some components are written in jQuery  JavaScript ,  PloneFlashUpload comes with more portions of code written in Flash and only  some really necessary parts written in JavaScript.  PloneFlashUpload and collective.uploadify cannot coexist  in the same Zope instance. They depend on different versions of the  SWFObject JavaScript library. If both are available in one instance,   neither of them will work.  PloneFlashUpload is installed by adding Products.PloneFlashUpload to the  eggs section of the instance in the Plone buildout. The product needs to be installed  as an add-on product. After doing so, an action Upload is enabled on folders.  Additionally, a configlet is created in the control panel of Plone. We have two  configuration options:    	 Completion URL  default: flashupload : After a successful upload of all  files, Plone redirects to this URL. The default is set to flashupload. This is  the name of the upload page, and thus Plone will not redirect.   	 Valid Portal Types  default: File, Image : PloneFlashUpload ordinarily uses   the content type registry to determine what type of content to create. If the  acquired content type is in this list, PloneFlashUpload creates it accordingly.  If the type that the registry returns is not in this list, then the standard File  type is used.  The upload view of PloneFlashUpload is organized differently from collective. uploadify. The queue is shown above the Upload button. This button is a Flash  applet masking itself as a normal HTML button. Files are uploaded immediately  after they are selected. There is an additional Cancel All Uploads button.  [ 228 ]   Chapter 8  To limit the size for uploaded files, we need to set the pfu_file_size_limit  property in the site_properties of the portal_properties. The default limit is  100 MB.   Flash uploads and https: In some combinations there can be problems with Flash-based uploads.  From the technical perspective, the Flash applet posts a response with  the selected file to the Zope server. If you use basic authentication   directly or with WebServerAuth , the Flash client is not able to access  the credentials, and thus fails to upload. There are reports that it works  with combinations of session or cookie authentication. For collective. uploadify, there is a forum entry on this topic that you can find at  http:  www.uploadify.com forum viewtopic.php?f=4&t=591.  For PloneFlashUpoad, there is a bug filed in the tracker at http:   plone.org products ploneflashupload issues 10.  [ 229 ]   Advanced Upload Teachniques  Doing multiuploads of ZIP structures with  atreal.massloader There is a third solution of through the Web uploader. This one has a completely  different approach. Instead of using a Flash applet as a helper for doing the upload,  the product utilizes ZIP packages for the bulk upload. The product comes with a  form, which allows us to upload one single file that has to be ZIP or 7z packed. It  unpacks the file and creates content objects out of it. The advantages are clear:   	 The package does not depend on external solutions such as Flash     	 This approach also lets us create complex structures with nested folders    or JavaScript.  in one go.  Let's see how it works. To install the product, we simply point to the egg, which is  available on PyPi  http:  pypi.python.org pypi atreal.massloader   in the  instance section of our buildout. We need to include both the egg and the ZCML of  the package. Next, we install the product as an add-on product and are ready to go.  The product comes with a configlet registered at the control panel of Plone.   The options we can set are:   	 Limit size of each file in the zip file  in Megabytes   default: 20 : Each file  contained in the ZIP file must fit this maximum size. If the size exceeds this  limit, the object is not created. The field is required.   	 MassLoader Aware Types  default: Folder, Large Folder, and Plone Site :   These folderish content types can use MassLoader.    	 Treat Images like Files  default: False : If this Boolean value is set to True,  all uploaded files recognized as images will be created as content type File.   	 Portal Type for file  default: File : This content type is used to create  files. We have to be aware that the content type must implement the   setFile method.   	 Portal Type for folder  default: Folder : The content type used to create  folders. Be aware that the content type must be folderish and must allow  creating content objects of the file type selected.   	 Additional Fields  default: empty : In this field we can specify additional  fields that are copied from the base container. Let's assume the following  example. We add creators to the Additional Fields field. If importing a ZIP  archive, all created content objects will inherit the contents of the creator   field of the container.  [ 230 ]   Chapter 8  On a default installation, the permission for the ZIP import is set to the roles  "Manager" and "Owner". Users with this role see an Import tab in the object tabs.  atreal.massloader has the following replacement policy: If a folder with the same  ID already exists, it is conserved. If the same file exists with the same ID, just the data  is updated.  There are some issues with 7-Zip and empty folders. 7-Zip archives with empty  folders are not valid and thus not created.  After successful processing of all archive content, atreal.massloader generates  a nice summary, which can be built as a document too. The import screen with a  report looks as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 231 ]   Advanced Upload Teachniques atreal.massloader on Mac OS X If you are using Mac OS X, you might have problems installing atreal.massloader  with the buildout. This is because the product depends on the PyLZMA library,  which does the 7z decoding. As it is written in C, it needs to be compiled and this  creates problems on Mac OS X. For Windows there is an already compiled version of  PyLZMA, so you don't have to worry in this case.  To install the library, you have to apply a patch and install the library manually.

Web uploaders compared Here is a matrix as a decision guideline for helping to choose one or the other product:  Product  collective. uploadify  PloneFlashUpload  atreal.massloader ZIP  Recognized   Content   Types  jQuery and  Flash  Technology Special  Chars in  Filenames Normalized Images     Files     Documents Images    Files Images    Files    Folders  Flash and  JavaScript  Normalized   No  SSL  Size  Limit  Existing  Content  Yes  Partial Plone   standard  Yes  Yes  Partial Plone   standard Partial  Yes  [ 233 ]   Advanced Upload Teachniques   	   	   	  In the product collective.uploadify and PloneFlashUpload, the  SSL is partial because it depends on the authentication backend. Simple  authentication does not work. Other  session or cookie based  solutions may  work depending on the setup. In the product atreal.massloader the Existing Content is partial because  simple content types with existing IDs are updated, but folders with existing  IDs are kept. In the product atreal.massloader the special characters in filenames are  noramlized because ZIPs don't store the encoding of the filenames. If we  share ZIPs with special characters between different operating systems,   these characters will be doomed  http:  datadriven.com.au 2008 12  zip-files-and-encoding-i-hate-you  . In the best case it will result in  non-readable characters. In the worst case, the objects will not be accessible  any longer because of mysterious encoding errors.  Alternative protocols for uploading files Besides the previously shown through-the-Web approaches, there are some other  ways to get files into Plone. These approaches use different protocols for accessing  the database of Plone, the ZODB. Because it is not through the Web, we need other  clients for uploading the data. Of course, this has advantages and disadvantages.  It is another piece of software we use and probably have to learn. In the case of  WebDAV, it is usually the filesystem explorer that comes along with the operating  system and is understood by most people.  On the other hand, these clients are usually optimized for file transfer and provide  a user-friendly uploading experience. With the right protocol and the right client,  the process of uploading files is nothing more than a drag-and-drop operation. Let's  investigate the two options: WebDAV and FTP.  Using the File Transfer Protocol  FTP  with  Plone FTP is the abbreviation for File Transfer Protocol. This protocol is very old and  has existed since the early days of the Internet. Its only purpose is, as its name  already suggests, transferring files over the net. It is very good, but not suitable   for high-security needs because everything  including credentials  is transferred   in cleartext.  [ 234 ]   To enable FTP for Plone, we have to extend our buildout. FTP is a feature of Zope  and is deactivated in a default instance setup. To enable FTP for our Zope instance,  we have to change our buildout like this:  Chapter 8  [instance] recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance zope2-location = ${zope2:location} user = admin:admin http-address = 8080 ftp-address = 8021 debug-mode = on verbose-security = on ...  Additional to the server listening on 8080 for incoming HTTP requests, we tell the  ZServer to listen on 8021 for incoming FTP requests. Of course, we have to rerun  the buildout after the change. After this is done, all is in place and we can run the  instance in foreground mode to see if everything works. The output of starting the  instance should look the following:  $ bin instance fg   Users tom plonebook-buildout parts instance bin runzope -X debug-mode=on  2009-11-15 10:15:08 INFO ZServer HTTP server started at Sun Nov 15  10:15:08 2009          Hostname: 0.0.0.0          Port: 8080          Hostname: 0.0.0.0          Port: 8021  2009-11-15 10:15:09 INFO ZServer FTP server started at Sun Nov 15  10:15:09 2009  The most common reason why it does not work is that the selected FTP port is taken  by another process. If this is the case for you, simply choose another one. Any free  port will do the job. For the next step, we need an FTP client to upload our data.  Choosing an FTP client There are numerous clients available for every operating system. At least there is  the ftp command-line client that is available on every platform. This client supports  just the bare minimal features and we usually want something more user-friendly.  If we want to stick to the command line, ncftp  http:  www.ncftp.com   is a good  option. It is available for all common platforms and has some goodies such as tab  completion, bookmarks, recursive retrieval, and auto-resume downloads.  [ 235 ]   Advanced Upload Teachniques  A good graphical FTP client available on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows is FileZilla   http:  filezilla-project.org  . It comes with a double-column GUI and  supports drag-and-drop operations:  In the standard installation, only users with the Manager and the Owner roles have  FTP access, which is protected by the FTP access permission of Zope. Let's assume  we want to allow our contributors to upload data in a single folder called upload.  Therefore, we need to create this folder first. Next, we allow the FTP access for  contributors in this folder. We do this in the ZMI. In the security tab of the folder,   we enable FTP access for contributors as shown in the following screenshot:   [ 236 ]   Chapter 8  We have to make sure that all users who may need to upload data with FTP have  the Contributor role set on the folder. This can be either done globally or via local  roles on the folder, which can be set using the Sharing tab. That's it! Now we have  FTP access for our contributors in place. Let's assume our host is example.org, the  site is named site and the username of our contributor is jsmith with the password  secret. The FTP URL for uploading in this case is:  ftp:  jsmith:secret@example.org site upload  We can use content rules to spread the content to different locations in the site or we  can open more folders for uploading content. If we open the whole Plone site for FTP  access, all the tools living in the site will be visible with the FTP client.  Content manipulation with WebDAV A solution similar to FTP is the WebDAV approach. WebDAV is the acronym for  Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning and is an open standard for  supplying files through the Internet. Users can access files in the same way as if they  were stored locally.  Technically speaking, WebDAV is an extension of the HTTP 1.1 protocol that lifts  some restrictions of HTTP. With HTTP it is only possible to upload single files with  the POST method, but with WebDAV it is possible to transmit complete directories.  Also, there is a version control specified.  Setting up WebDAV for Zope is quite similar to FTP. We have to enable an  additional WebDAV component in the ZServer. We do so by adding the following  line to the instance section of our buildout.  [instance] recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance zope2-location = ${zope2:location} user = admin:admin http-address = 8080 webdav-address = 8022 debug-mode = on verbose-security = on ...  [ 237 ]   The startup sequence for running Zope in the foreground after updating the buildout  looks like this:    Users tom plonebook-buildout parts instance bin runzope -X debug-mode=on  2009-11-15 16:11:24 INFO ZServer HTTP server started at Sun Nov 15  16:11:24 2009  2009-11-15 16:11:26 INFO ZServer WebDAV server started at Sun Nov 15  16:11:26 2009  Advanced Upload Teachniques  $ bin instance fg          Hostname: 0.0.0.0          Port: 8080          Hostname: 0.0.0.0          Port: 8022  If the port 8022 is taken by another process, this will fail. As we have done for  FTP, it is safe to choose a different port in this case.  Finding a WebDAV client As the format promises, we can use our favorite operating system file manager as  a WebDAV client. If you use Linux with KDE, Konqueror will be your first choice.  With Konqueror you specify the URL together with the protocol. Again, we assume  our Plone site is named site and upload is the folder where we want to put our  stuff. The URL for Konqueror is:  webdav:  example.org:8022 site upload  The credentials are queried with a popup. We have to bear in mind that these are  transmitted unencrypted.  All other clients usually use HTTP as a prefix for WebDAV URLs. In Mac OS X, you  open the Go menu and select Connect to Server. In a dialog box, you need to enter  the WebDAV URL as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 238 ]   Chapter 8  After entering the URL, we are prompted for our credentials in a new popup.  Entering these enables an entry in the Shared section on the left side of our Finder  window. From then on, the share is accessible like a local folder. You can copy, paste,  and move arbitrary files there.   In Windows, the procedure is similar but the terminology is different. Instead of  connecting a Finder share, you add an additional network resource as shown in the  following screenshot:  The screenshot is from a German edition of Windows. On an  English edition or other language edition, the layout should  look basically the same.  [ 239 ]   Advanced Upload Teachniques  While there is only one permission involved for FTP access, there are some more  for WebDAV:    	 Manage WebDAV Locks  Default roles: Manager   	 WebDAV Lock items  Default roles: Manager Owner   	 WebDAV Unlock items  Default roles: Manager Owner   	 WebDAV access  Default roles: Authenticated   This is because WebDAV resources are locked when processed. For storing  reading operations, the WebDAV access permission is used. The WebDAV locking  mechanism is used in Plone for locking work copies.  If an object is locked erroneously, we can unlock it as an administrator. In the control  panel of Zope  the Control_Panel in the ZMI , there is an option WebDAV Lock  Manager. There is a list of all locked objects that can be unlocked there too. A search  field for searching locked objects by their path is provided there as well:  To unlock objects, we simply select them in the list and click on the Unlock  objects button.  [ 240 ]   Chapter 8  Using the Enfold Desktop as a Plone client  with Windows If you are using Windows, there is a complete integrated solution for managing  content with an alternative client. This client is called Enfold Desktop and is  available from its project page on the Plone site  http:  plone.org products  enfold_desktop . The client integrates in the Windows Explorer and aims to  provide as many Explorer features as possible.   Besides drag-and-drop, Cut, Copy, and Paste, it supports some Plone-specific  operations that are not available with standard WebDAV. These include:   	 Managing Workflows  	 Setting Metadata  	 Changing Permissions  	 Passing the Windows login to Plone  	 Bookmarks  	 Filename normalization, and a pluggable and customizable API  It is the only solution among those described that allows editing the metadata and  permissions directly. This is because it was made for interaction with Plone as its  only goal. All other approaches utilizing alternative protocols are not Plone specific  and serve a generic purpose. The downside is that Enfold Desktop works only on  Windows clients. While accessing the Enfold Desktop, we are prompted for the URL  and the credentials as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 241 ]   Advanced Upload Teachniques  Uploading files with Enfold Desktop is done with the following steps. As you might  notice, there is not much difference between using Enfold Desktop and local files:   	 Double-click on a file to edit it.  	 Right-click on the item to view or change properties on the file or folder.  	 Drag-and-drop the object  either between Plone folders, or between Plone    	 Use Cut Copy Paste commands  either between Plone folders, or between   and your file system .  Plone and your file system .   	 You can create new content by selecting File  New  or right-clicking on a   folder  and selecting the type of file you wish to create from the menu.  Here we have an images folder where we added the four default images  of Windows:   Summary This chapter was all about getting content into Plone. We saw two variants for  effectively uploading binary data. One approach was the web-based solution where  multiple files could be uploaded to Plone with the help of Flash or ZIP archives.  The other approach was to upload files using alternative protocols such as FTP or  WebDAV. For this solution separate clients are needed in addition to the web browser,  but the upload is very efficient and can usually be done by a drag-and-drop process.  Finally we saw Enfold Desktop, which is an integrated Plone client for Windows.  It allows the creation and manipulation of Plone content with the File Explorer for  Windows. With the help of one of these solutions, creating a gallery with many  images is fun again.  In the next chapter we will learn about the default and enhanced data storage  techniques of Plone.  [ 242 ]   Advanced Storage  Multimedia files tend to be very large—even with clever codecs, which shrink audio,  video, and image data enormously. Every database serves its purpose. Relational  databases  such as PostgresSQL or MySQL  are good for tabular-structured data with  many relations. Object databases  such as the ZODB  are especially good at mapping  complex data structures. The advantage of NOSQL databases  such as CouchDB or  MongoDB  is their scalability and their concurrency model. The best storage for files or  BLOBs  Binary Large Objects  is still the filesystem.  In this chapter, we will see how Plone stores files and images. The default way is  to put them into the ZODB like everything else. This is good because everything is  handled in one place: the data storage, the transaction machinery, and the global  permission system. Unfortunately, the ZODB is not very efficient for file storage.   In this chapter we try to find more efficient storage techniques.  Generally speaking, there are two bottlenecks with large files on web systems.   One is the storage of big files and the other is the publishing of big files. The key question for storage is: Where do I put my data? This question is usually  not fully answered by: in the ZODB or on the filesystem. There are many things to  consider: How efficient is reading and writing?, Does the storage integrate with the  transaction model of Zope?, Does the storage incorporate the permission model of  Plone?, and so on. The key question for publishing is: How do I get the data from the storage to the  client? The standard answer for Zope is through the ZPublisher. But is it really  necessary to block a whole thread while transmitting binary data? The questions  related to the transaction and permission model are applicable here too.   Advanced Storage  In this chapter, we will take a short look at the default storage mechanism of Plone  and how it is accessed via Archetypes' content. The main part of the chapter will be the  investigation of methods to bring an efficient storage of binary files to Plone. Ideally,  such a solution stores large data efficiently while it keeps all  or at least most  of the  CMS features such as the earlier mentioned transaction and permission features.  This part is split into two subparts. One will be about storage techniques and the  other about publishing techniques. While the storage mechanisms hook into the  backend where the data is actually made persistent, the publishing techniques hook  into the publisher where the data is transmitted between the server and the client.  In this chapter we will see:   	 How object content is stored into the ZODB  	 How the Archetype storage of Plone works  	 How to use the ExternalStorage and the FileSystemStorage products   as alternative storage backends for Archetypes  	 How we can store binary data as ZODB BLOBs  	 How filesystem content can be accessed via Reflecto  	 How we can hook into the publishing process with Tramline to serve    binary content  Default storage in Plone One big feature of Plone is the "batteries included". If we install Plone with the unified  installer or with a buildout, everything is in place for a full-featured CMS. We get a full  application with a web server, workflow system, layout, and a database backend. The  database of Plone is called ZODB  Zope Object DataBase . As the name indicates, it is  an object-oriented database, which stores object pickles. The advantage of this system  is the tight integration into the paradigms of the object oriented language Python.  Persistence is achieved by inheriting from a special base class. Set up a ZODB stored in the testdb.fs file:  >>> from ZODB import FileStorage, DB >>> storage = FileStorage.FileStorage 'testdb.fs'  >>> db = DB storage  >>> connection = db.open   >>> root = connection.root    [ 244 ]   To store objects in the ZODB, all we have to do is to inherit from the Persistent  class. All attributes will be pickled to the database automatically.  Chapter 9  >>> from Persistence import Persistent >>> class Person Persistent : ...     def __init__ self, name : ...         self.name = name  We create an instance of the Person class and save it to the ZODB with a simple  mapping. To make the object actually persistent, we need to commit the transaction.  After this, we can leave the command line. The Person object joe is stored as an  object pickle on the filesystem.  >>> joe = Person 'joe'  >>> root['persons'] = [joe] >>> import transaction >>> transaction.commit    This is basically how the ZODB works. As the example shows, there is nothing  Zope-specific in it, which means it can be used completely outside of Zope and  outside of web applications to store object data. Zope objects are far more complex  than the object shown in the example. They are a combination of base classes and  layers put on top of the persistence machinery. They have base classes for copy and  paste support, acquisition, properties, WebDAV access, FTP access, and so on; but  the principle of storage is the same as the simple example shown previously.  Archetypes storage The framework for Plone's content is called Archetypes. Archetypes' objects have a  schema describing their content fields. These fields define the type of the content.  Possible types are simple strings, numbers, Booleans, files, dates, and so on. The  fields contain restrictions and validators for the content, and they assign a widget to  the field. The Archetypes implementation of the default content types can be found  in the ATContentTypes product. We have already glanced at this topic when we  investigated field access for image, video, and audio content. The standard field and  widget definition for the Image content type looks like this:  ATImageSchema = ATContentTypeSchema.copy   + Schema               ImageField 'image',                         required=True,                         primary=True,                   languageIndependent=True,        storage = AnnotationStorage migrate=True ,         swallowResizeExceptions = zconf.swallowImageResizeExceptions.                                    enable,  [ 245 ]   Advanced Storage          pil_quality = zconf.pil_config.quality,          pil_resize_algo = zconf.pil_config.resize_algo,         max_size = zconf.ATImage.max_image_dimension,          sizes= {'large'   :  768, 768 ,                  'preview' :  400, 400 ,                  'mini'    :  200, 200 ,                  'thumb'   :  128, 128 ,                  'tile'    :   64, 64 ,                  'icon'    :   32, 32 ,                  'listing' :   16, 16 ,                 },          validators =   'isNonEmptyFile', V_REQUIRED ,                         'checkImageMaxSize', V_REQUIRED  ,         widget = ImageWidget                   description = '',                  label= _ u'label_image', default=u'Image' ,                  show_content_type = False,  ,         , marshall=PrimaryFieldMarshaller       All the common metadata is available via the ATContentTypeSchema. The important  bit is the ImageField, which stores the binary content of the image or the image  itself. Besides the validators, the widget, and some image-specific configuration,  there is the storage attribute. Archetypes have a pluggable storage system. In the  earlier Plone versions, the default storage was the AttributeStorage. This very  simple approach saves the field data as attributes on the content object. As content  objects inherit from the Persistent class, they are pickled automatically.  Another storage, which has become the new default storage, is the  AnnotationStorage. With this method, the field data is saved as annotations on  the content object. Annotations are persistent adapters. They can be understood as  certain aspects of an object that are stored in the ZODB. This is more efficient than  the AttributeStorage because annotations are stored as BTrees. To access modify the data, Archetypes uses generic getter and setter methods.  These getter and setter methods are constructed from the name of the Archetype  field following this schema:  getter: get  setter: set   The getter and setter methods for the image field are getImage and setImage.  These methods mask the actual access to the underlying storage, so it is possible to  change it without touching the high-level code.  [ 246 ]   Chapter 9  For AttributeStorage, accessing the field value via standard attribute  access is possible. But don't do it! Use the getter and setter methods  the Archetypes framework defines. If you change the storage strategy at a  later point, you will be in trouble with the direct attribute access.  The earlier versions of Archetypes were shipped with an SQL storage, but it was  dropped as it didn't work very well. It is not trivial to synchronize the transaction  machinery of Zope with the external transaction machinery of an RDBMS  Relational  Database Management System .  Outsourcing multimedia content Until now we have only considered the storage of data in the ZODB, the native  database of Zope and hence of Plone. As we stated earlier, the ZODB is not  optimized for binary data. A big ZODB with a lot of BLOBs inside will become slow  and hard to manage  pack, back up, and so on . There is a very simple solution  for working around this downside. The answer is "links". Linking content is the  vitality motor of the Web, as we know it. Although linking people seems to get more  important in Web 2.0, linking content is classic.   We can do linking content with Plone. In the chapters for audio and video, we saw  the collective.flowplayer product. This product allows us to integrate external  multimedia content as link objects. Plone does neither the storage nor the publishing  of this data. Everything is handled by an external web server. Something similar can  be done with the collective.plonetruegallery gallery product with images. It is  possible to include images from external providers such as Picasa or Flickr.  The method for outsourcing multimedia contents has several advantages. Neither  the ZODB storage nor the Zope publisher is needed for serving multimedia content.  On high-traffic sites, serving large binary files is usually a bottleneck. Another  advantage is the fact that this method is always there. Linking images can be done  with Kupu without any additional configuration, and allowing the embed and the  object tags in safe HTML can link other multimedia content.  We already did this in  Chapter 4, in the section Embedding videos with Kupu.  With additional views, the Link  content type can be utilized to integrate external multimedia content as collective. flowplayer does.  [ 247 ]   Advanced Storage  The obvious downside of this method is that it is only sensible for public content  because of the lack of authentication. Of course, we can limit the access to a Link  object in Plone, but still the link to the content needs to be world readable, as  the authentication mechanism can't communicate with a possible web server  authentication via a link. Another negative aspect is the external hosting of the binary  files. While outsourcing content we rely on an additional application. We either have  to administrate this application ourselves, or we depend on the administration and  uptime of a third-party provider. There is no guaranty for this on free services such as  Picasa or Flickr.  Optimized data storage in Plone Until now, we had two approaches for storing binary data in Plone. One was the  ZODB and one was completely external. The optimal storage for binary data is the  filesystem of the operating system. The advantage of storing data in the ZODB is  the tight integration of the transaction machinery and the authentication mechanism  of Zope. There are solutions that aim to provide the best of these two worlds. Let's  investigate some. We start with alternative Archetypes field storages.   Using ExternalStorage as an Archetype  storage backend ExternalStorage is an add-on product for Plone that provides an extra storage  for Archetypes. This storage puts the field contents in a given location on the  filesystem outside the ZODB. The product is available as an egg on PyPi: Products. ExternalStorage. It is included into the buildout configuration in the standard way,  but doesn't need to be installed as an add-on because it only provides the storage for  custom products. It is used for defining schemas the following way:   Usual Zope CMF Plone Archetypes imports ... from Products.ExternalStorage.ExternalStorage import ExternalStorage ... my_schema = Schema       FileField 'file',               ...               storage=ExternalStorage prefix='foo' ,               widget=FileWidget ...                 ,     ...         ...  [ 248 ]   Chapter 9  The constructor of ExternalStorage takes the following options:  Option prefix  archive rename suffix  path_ method  Type String  Default Files  String  ' '  String  getExternalPath  Description The name of a directory, which is  used as a container for the field data. Not used. Not used. This string is appended to the filename  of the file with the binary data. Returns the filesystem path  with  filename  where the field contents  should be stored. See some common  examples below.  Instance relative path to current portal  this is the default behavior :   	    path = portal_url.getRelativeContentURL instance   Instance absolute path, including portal name and all of the above:   	    path = ' '.join instance.getPhysicalPath      	 Flat Instance UID:    path = instance UID      	 Sorted by Portal Type:    path = instance.getTypeInfo  .getId   + ' ' + instance.getId    These are some examples that are shipped with the product. They can be found  in the ExternalExample directory in the examples directory. To play with these,  we have to copy the ExternalExample directory to the products directory of our  instance and restart our instance. The default storage root for the binary content is the var directory of the instance.  In buildout environments, this directory is in the parts directory. Hence it is very  likely to get deleted by a buildout run. There is a way to override the default storage  root. All we have to do is to define the OS environment variable EXTERNAL_STORAGE_ BASE_PATH with the desired path. A good place for us to do this is in the buildout  configuration file directly:  [instance] recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance eggs =     ${buildout:eggs}     Plone     Products.ExternalStorage  [ 249 ]   Advanced Storage  products =   ${buildout:directory} products environment-vars =   EXTERNAL_STORAGE_BASE_PATH ${buildout:directory} var externalstorage  This is almost everything that can be said about the ExternalStorage product. It  serves only one purpose and it does it well. From the code and functional perspective,  it has been very lightweight. There is almost nothing to configure, and the code has  stabilized because it is around for ages. It is not so lightweight from the memory  management perspective. For copy cut actions, the data is stored in a volatile attribute.  Volatile attributes are attributes of persistent classes that are not stored to  the database. All attributes starting with "_v_" are considered volatile for  the ZODB.  Another advantage of the product is that it can be combined with other solutions.  While some fields of one content type may be stored externally, others may not. This  makes ExternalStorage a flexible add-on for custom products. A shortcoming of  the product is that there are no patches prepared for using it with the default content  types including binary data.   Using FileSystemStorage as an Archetype  storage backend A similar approach to ExternalStorage is the FileSystemStorage  FSS . Because  it has existed for some time it is very stable and commonly used. It is still actively  maintained and improved. The basic technique of the FSS is to plug into the Archetypes  storage mechanism. In earlier versions of Plone, the product was called Products. FileSystemStorage and in Plone 3 and onwards the product is called iw.fss. The product is easily installed with buildout by adding the egg, the ZCML slug,  and the ZCML meta slug to the Zope instance section:  [buildout] ... eggs =   ...   iw.fss   ... [instance] ... zcml =   ...   iw.fss   iw.fss-meta ...  [ 250 ]   Chapter 9  Adding the product is not sufficient for a complete working solution. We have to  configure the storage first. The product uses the plone-filesystemstorage.conf  file for configuration. This file contains two filesystem paths—one for the storage and  one for the backup—and the storage strategy for each site. There are three possible  positions for the configuration file. The one with the highest preference is the etc  directory of the instance, the second location is the etc directory of the product, and  finally there is a fallback in the etc directory of the product with the .in suffix. This  fallback file serves as a documentation for the storage options too.  FSS is mainly configured with XML in the same way Zope itself is configured  in zope.conf. The ZConfig package is used by FSS too. A working sample  configuration is provided in plone-filesystemstorage.conf.in with all the  configuration documentation in place. It assumes we have the $INSTANCE_HOME  var fss_storage and the $INSTANCE_HOME var fss_backup directories, both  being read write enabled to the system user that runs the Zope process. Inconsistent  configuration features or missing directories raise explicit error messages at the  startup of Zope. Because we have no persistent access to the etc directory in a buildout environment  and we don't want to change an already bundled egg, there is a buildout recipe for  creating the config file for us. The recipe is called iw.recipe.fss and is available  on PyPi. It is used like this:  recipe = iw.recipe.fss zope-instances =     ${instance:location} storages =  The first is always generic     global    Others are always specific     site_flat  site flat  somewhere files  somewhere files_backup  The recipe points to the zope-instances, which use the FSS. If we have a ZEO  with multiple instances running, we need to specify all of them here. The second  configuration option is storages. It always starts with a global directive, which  is used as a fallback for all unconfigured sites. It is highly advised to specify a  configuration for every Plone site available in the ZODB. Doing so lets FSS assign  its maintenance tasks to the right Plone site. Take this for granted now; we will see  the reason for this in detail later in this chapter. There is one line of configuration  for every site. Each line takes up to five values. The first one is the name of the  configuration. It has to be unique, but may be chosen arbitrarily. It is a good practice  to set the name to the ID of the Plone site  or at least include the ID .  The second storage option is the full path of the Plone site in the ZODB. If we  have a Plone site called "Plone" in the root of our ZODB, the corresponding value   would be  Plone.  [ 251 ]   Advanced Storage  The third option is the storage strategy. It may be one of these values: directory   default , flat, site1, and site2.  The fourth option is the filesystem path for the storage of the data. It is optional and  points to the fss_storage_  directory inside the var directory of the buildout. The fifth option is the filesystem path for the data backup. It is optional as well and  points to the fss_backup_  directory inside the var directory of the buildout. Running the buildout now adds the egg and ZCML to our instance, and creates a  configuration file in the instance directory of the buildout. After restarting, we are  ready to install the iw.fss  FileSystemStorage  as an add-on.  If you add iw.fss to your Zope instance and have more than one Plone  site in your instance, you will have to install iw.fss in all the Plone  sites. Otherwise, the storage of files and images will cease to work in the  omitted sites.  Possible issue with certain versions of Plone and iw.fss If you are using iw.fss older than version 2.8.0rc1 and Plone 3.3, a bug  occurs when first starting the Zope instance. It says: AttributeError:  TranslationService. There is a patch to work around this problem.  It is bundled in the atreal.patchfss egg  http:  pypi.python. org pypi atreal.patchfss . The bug is described in http:   plone.org products filesystemstorage issues 39. For  Plone versions 3.3.1 and up, or iw.fss 2.8.0rc1 and up, this patch is not  necessary and should not be used because the issue is fixed!  Storage strategies of FSS A storage strategy defines how field values are stored in our filesystem. FSS comes  with four storage strategies. Each strategy requires two directories:   	 The storage directory stores field values in files according to the selected   storage strategy.   	 The backup directory keeps the files of deleted content for "Undo" purposes.  FSS supports the storage of RDF files to keep a set of metadata together with the  content. This feature is turned off by default. Using RDF together with FSS is beyond  the scope of this book.  [ 252 ]   Flat storage strategy All field values are stored in a flat structure. This strategy is the default one. The names  of the files are chosen following this pattern:  _ .  Here is an example of the flat storage:  Chapter 9  Directory storage strategy All field values are stored in a directory structure. Subdirectories are defined  on two levels. The first level of directories uses the first two characters of the   content UID. The second level of directories uses the first four characters of the  content UID. For the construction of the filenames, the following pattern is used:   _ .  Here is an example of the directory storage:  Some filesystems have performance problems with many files in the same directory.  If this is the case for our system and we have or expect lot of binary content, we  might want to choose the directory storage strategy over the flat storage strategy. Site storage strategy 1  [ 253 ]   Advanced Storage  All field values are stored in a directory structure mirroring the structure of the  Plone site. The filenames of these stored values are the filename of the field value,   or the field name if the filename is not defined.  Here is an example of the site storage strategy 1:  Site storage strategy 2 All field values are stored in a directory structure mirroring the structure of the Plone  site. Backup files are stored in a flat structure. The filenames of these stored values are  the filename of the field value, or the field name if the filename is not defined.  Here is an example of the site storage strategy 2:  [ 254 ]   Chapter 9  Some restrictions and guidelines for choosing the right storage strategy are:    	 Only one storage strategy can be selected for a given Plone site, but different   Plone sites in the same Zope instance may have distinct storage strategies.   	 For the best performance, we choose the flat storage strategy or the directory   storage strategy. If we need storage that looks like our Plone site  for example, to publish the  storage directory in a read-only Samba or NFS share , we choose the site  storage strategy 1 or the site storage strategy 2. If we need CMFEditions support  that means that one of the content types  using FSS is versioned with CMFEditions , we may NOT use the site storage  strategy 1 or the site storage strategy 2.   	   	  [ 255 ]   Advanced Storage  For all strategies, the backup files are kept in a flat structure following this  construction pattern:  _ .bak  Using FSS After installing and configuring FSS, it still does not do a lot. All it does is provide  a low-level functionality for storing binary contents on the filesystem. To actually  use it, we have to teach our content types to use this storage in our custom content  types. Or we can use FSS for the standard binary content types of Plone. These are  File, Image, and News Item. To exchange the Archetypes storage strategy, iw.fss  provides monkey patches. These patches can be triggered  using Zope 2.9 or later   with ZCML:   <configure xmlns="http:  namespaces.zope.org zope"        xmlns:zcml="http:  namespaces.zope.org zcml"        xmlns:fss="http:  namespaces.ingeniweb.com filesystemstorage">    <fss:typeWithFSS      zcml:condition="installed iw.fss"      class="Products.ATContentTypes.atct.ATFile"      fields="file"  >     The  required  attributes of this directive are:   	 class: The dotted name of the AT-based content type class  	 fields: One or more  space-separated  field names to wire with FSS  If we want to patch all three possible standard content types, there is a shortcut  ZCML file atct.zcml provided with FSS. It can be included with     [ 256 ]   in a custom product or with the following directives in our Plone buildout:  Chapter 9  [instance] recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance ... eggs =     ${buildout:eggs}     Plone     iw.fss zcml =     iw.fss     iw.fss-meta     iw.fss:atct.zcml  In the following screenshot, we see the management screen of FSS:  [ 257 ]   Advanced Storage  Under the title, we see the full path to the actual configuration file. If we use  buildout for generating this file, it can be worthwhile to know its exact position   to debug any FSS error. The next section displays the settings for the site. These  settings include the storage and the backup path, and the storage method  flat,  directory, site1, or site2 .   If FSS does not find any site-specific configuration, it prints a  prominent warning in red saying: THIS SITE USES THE COMMON  DEFAULT CONFIGURATION AND STORAGE AREA. IF THIS  DOES NOT MATTER ON DEVELOPMENT SITES, YOU SHOULD  NEVER DO THIS IN A PRODUCTION SITE. PLEASE FIX THE  CONFIGURATION AS DESCRIBED IN THE DOCUMENTATION  BEFORE ADDING ANY CONTENT IN THAT CASE.  The next section is reserved for the global settings. They are not used if there is a   site-specific configuration. They are there just for information purposes.  Then there is a table informing about the patched types. In the first column the  content classes are listed, and in the second column the fields and their original  storage methods are shown.  Finally, there is a section for configuring RDF.  This is not shown on the screenshot.   It is possible to turn RDF on and off here, and there is a field for specifying a custom  RDF script. This book does not cover using RDF with FSS. Migrating FSS It should go without saying that we should always back up a site before proceeding  to a deep migration like this one. It is safer to deny  writable  access to Zope during  the migration. This can be done by a rewrite rule of the frontend web server pointing  to a maintenance page. After the backup, we install iw.fss and the ZCML settings.  Next, we start our Zope instance in the foreground mode.  This is recommended if  we want to follow the migration logging.  For the actual migration process, we open  the FSS configlet in the control panel of Plone. We check that the main control panel  reports the expected settings  storage paths and strategies, supported content types,  and fields  and open the Migration tab.  Migration is available only if the site has its own configuration.  Otherwise, the following warning is issued: THE MIGRATION IS  DISABLED BECAUSE THIS SITE ACTUALLY USES THE FSS  COMMON DEFAULT CONFIGURATION. MIGRATING IN  SUCH SITUATION COULD LOSE CONTENT. PLEASE FIX THE  CONFIGURATION AND COME BACK HERE.  [ 258 ]   If we finished all previous steps successfully, we may check the options and proceed  to migrate.  After a successful migration, we may pack the ZODB immediately to finalize the  effect of using iw.fss.  Chapter 9  Migration between strategies Use the bin strategymigrator.py shell utility that ships with FSS.  Get more information on this utility using the Help option.  Using FSS in custom products Using FSS in custom Archetypes-based content types is very simple. All we  have to do is to select the FileSystemStorage as field storage in the schema of  the content type:   Usual Zope CMF Plone Archetypes imports ... from iw.fss.FileSystemStorage import FileSystemStorage ... my_schema = Schema       FileField 'file',               ...               storage=FileSystemStorage  ,               widget=FileWidget ...                 ,     ...         ...  FSS works with the following Archetypes fields:   	 FileField  	 AttachmentField  	 ImageField  	 TextField  	 StringField  For all other field types, the storage is useless and won't work. There is an example we can try in examples FSSItem.py to see a demo content type  using FSS. To play with this content type, we use  in the buildout directory :  $ bin instance stop $ export FSS_INSTALL_EXAMPLE_TYPES=1 $ bin instance fg  [ 259 ]   Advanced Storage Important things to know about FSS The five commandments of FSS are:   1.  We may never change any file in the storage paths unless we know exactly   what we are doing!  2.  We may never change the storage strategy of a Plone site once this site has   fields stored in the FSS storage path! If we share the same storage and backup paths among various Plone sites,  which is possible but not recommended, we may never click on any button   in the maintenance tab of the FSS configuration panel!  3.   4.  ZEXP exports don't embed the associated FSS storage. We may not move   our Plone site within Zope instances using ZEXP exports unless we move   the storage and backup directories along with the ZEXP file.  5.  After changing the FSS configuration, we always restart our Zope instance in  the foreground as configuration errors are not reported when Zope is started  as a daemon or as a Windows service.  If we use FSS, we need to make sure the filesystem data gets backed up together   with the Data.fs.   FSS and remote file systems In the cases where we use ZEO and split the load over several machines,  we need to make the FSS accessible with a remote filesystem  CIFS, NFS   and for all involved machines. If the connection of such a filesystem  breaks, the Zope instance will not respond. The process is still around  and the port is open, but it is in a non-working state. We can diagnose  this problem by reading writing to the remote filesystem manually. After  fixing the problem, we need to restart the instances.  Storing binary data as BLOBs The previous two solutions we investigated had the same strategy. They both provided  alternative storage implementations for Archetypes. These implementations were  made to put the binary data on the filesystem rather than in the ZODB.  The approach we want to look at now follows another strategy. It is more low level  and utilizes the BLOB feature of the ZODB, which has been available since version  3.8 of the database.  [ 260 ]   The easiest way to get ZODB blob support in Plone 3 is by using the plone.app. blob package to work with installations based on buildout.  Chapter 9  BLOB in Plone 4 The BLOB storage is the default storage mechanism for files and  images in Plone 4. The default migration mechanism of Plone will  handle all ZODB-stored files and images if upgrading to Plone 4.  To get started, we simply add the plone.app.blob package, which is available  on PyPi to the eggs and the zcml section in our buildout. Additionally, we need  to specify a blob-storage directory for the instance section. Then we rerun our  buildout, restart the Plone instance, and install plone.app.blob as an add-on.  A note on versions The example buildout works if you start fresh. If you have an older buildout,  you probably have to update it and or pin some versions to it. plone. app.blob works with ZODB version 3.8 and up, but Plone 3.x needs ZODB  3.8; thus, you have to pin the ZODB version to 3.8.x. The plone.recipe. zope2instance needs to be something between 1.0 and 4.0.  A sample buildout configuration looks like this:  [buildout] parts = zope2 instance extends = http:  dist.plone.org release 3.3 versions.cfg find-links =     http:  dist.plone.org release 3.3     http:  dist.plone.org thirdparty  versions = versions  [versions] ZODB3 = 3.8.4  [zope2] recipe = plone.recipe.zope2install url = ${versions:zope2-url}  [instance] recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance zope2-location = ${zope2:location} blob-storage = var blobstorage user = admin:admin eggs =  [ 261 ]   Advanced Storage      Plone     plone.app.blob zcml = plone.app.blob  The directory specified as blob-storage  usually a directory called blobstorage  in the var directory of the buildout  is created. The directory is just created; no  permissions are set. Starting the instance later will issue a warning about insecure  mode settings. If we want a secure BLOB storage directory and a non-complaining  Zope, we need to set the  POSIX  mode of the BLOB storage directory to 0700. This  permission setting gives only the owning user all rights on the directory; the group  and all others get no permissions. Installing plone.app.blob makes the File content type BLOB enabled. The binary  part of the file is now not stored to the ZODB, but on the filesystem. Theoretically,  the BLOB mechanism of the ZODB supports two layouts—lawn and bushy. Lawn is  a simple flat structure and bushy creates an eight-level directory structure  one level  per byte  in big-endian order from the OID of an object. The layout is set from the  content of a hidden file named .layout, which is created the first time the instance  is run.  An example BLOB storage directory with the bushy layout looks like this:  [ 262 ]   Chapter 9  A sample ZEO buildout configuration could look like this:  [buildout] parts = zope2 zeoserver instance1 instance2 extends = http:  dist.plone.org release 3.3.3 versions.cfg find-links =     http:  dist.plone.org release 3.3.3     http:  dist.plone.org thirdparty  versions = versions  [versions] ZODB3 = 3.8.4 zc.buildout = 1.4.2  [zope2] recipe = plone.recipe.zope2install url = ${versions:zope2-url}  [zeoserver] recipe = plone.recipe.zope2zeoserver zope2-location = ${zope2:location} zeo-address = 127.0.0.1:8100 zeo-var = ${buildout:directory} var blob-storage = ${zeoserver:zeo-var} blobstorage eggs = plone.app.blob  [instance1] recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance zope2-location = ${zope2:location} zeo-address = ${zeoserver:zeo-address} blob-storage = ${zeoserver:blob-storage} zeo-client = on shared-blob = on user = admin:admin eggs =     Plone     plone.app.blob zcml = plone.app.blob  [instance2] <= instance1 http-address = 8081  [ 263 ]   Advanced Storage  Please note the configuration options blob-storage and shared-blob specified  in [instance1] and [instance2]. To enable BLOB support on a ZEO client  or  a standalone instance , we always have to specify a path in the blob-storage  configuration option. If shared-blob is set to on, the ZEO client will assume it  can read BLOB files directly from within the path specified in the blob-storage  option. This path might also refer to a network share, if the ZEO client and server  are installed on separate machines. However, to stream BLOB files trough the ZEO  connection, we have to set the shared-blob option to off. The path specified in the  blob-storage option is ignored in this situation, but it needs to be set nevertheless.  A good source for documentation, including some troubleshooting information, is  the products page on plone.org: http:  plone.org products plone.app.blob.  BLOB images While files automatically use the BLOB storage, images have to be initialized  separately to make use of the alternative storage. To enable BLOB-enhanced images  on the site, we have to go to the portal_setup in the ZMI. There we select the  Import tab, and in the profile selection widget we choose plone.app.blob: Image  replacement type. We unselect the Include dependencies checkbox and click on the  Import all steps button. This enables the replacement of the Image content type with  a BLOB-enabled content type. There are no visual changes on the site. We can create  a test image and monitor the growth of the BLOB storage to verify that everything  works as expected.  The imaging part of the BLOB integration is bundled in a separate product:  plone.app.imaging. It comes with a configlet in the Plone control panel. On the  corresponding page, it is possible to manage the scales provided by the Image  content type through the Web.  plone.app.imaging can be used standalone without  plone.app.blob for scaling images. The installation and  usage procedures for ZODB-only content are the same as  those for BLOB content.   [ 264 ]   This configlet page looks like this:  Chapter 9  Each scale has one line of configuration. The first part is the name of the scale and the  second part is the image dimensions  width and height are separated by a colon . If  we want to add an additional scale, as we already did in Chapter 2, the configuration  line would be: vga 640:480  Migrating existing content In-place content migration is provided for existing File and Image content. The  Products.contentmigration package is required for this to work. To install  this package, we need to add its name to the eggs section of our buildout.cfg:  [instance] ... eggs =     ...     plone.app.blob     Products.contentmigration zcml +=     plone.app.blob  [ 265 ]   Advanced Storage  To migrate our existing file content to blobs, we can use the migration interfaces  provided at http:    @@blob-file-migration to migrate File content  as well as http:    @@blob-image-migration for Image content. We  need to replace   with the URL of our Plone site. The pages show the  number of available ATFile or ATImage instances, and then let us convert these to  the provided blob content types with a click on the Migrate x item s  button.  BLOB and Plone4Artists Currently, the Plone4Artists products have problems with BLOB-enabled  files. There are solutions, but they are very hacky and unfinished. To use  them, you really need to know what you are doing. A point to start is the  Plone4Artists users' mailing list with the [p4a-user] P4a subtyper   P4a  Audio Broken with Blob Storage thread.  Accessing filesystem content with Reflecto A completely different approach is Reflecto. The Reflecto product is a tool to  incorporate a part of the filesystem into a Plone site. It allows us to browse through  a filesystem hierarchy and access the files in it. Reflecto also indexes the filesystem  contents. This means the objects can be found via the integrated search of the site,  and the metadata can be accessed quickly without the need of reading or writing  to the original content on the filesystem. This approach is very good if we need  to preserve the original names of the files, have a central place for these files, and  need to share the files with other applications. The content may be fed by another  application too. It can be a NFS or CIFS share.  Reflecto is available as an egg on PyPi and is added to the buildout in the   common way.  [instance] ... eggs =     ...    Products.Reflecto  We install Reflecto: a window unto the filesystem as an add-on. This adds another  content type to the site: Reflector. As the product name suggests, a Reflector is a  window to the filesystem. If we are adding a Reflector, we need to specify a required  title and a required filesystem path.   [ 266 ]   Chapter 9  It goes without saying that the filesystem path needs to be on the  same server on which the Plone application runs.  Adding a Reflector might take some time because all subdirectories of the given path  are walked recursively and indexed in the Plone catalog. If we have TextIndexNG3  installed, all convertible files  PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, HTML, and so on  are  considered for indexing too.  After the object is created and the indexing is done, the filesystem path appears like a  standard folder in Plone:  [ 267 ]   Advanced Storage  Still, there are some differences when compared to standard folders. We can't  create objects inside the Reflector, but we can create directories and upload files   on the filesystem.  If the filesystem path is manipulated from outside of Plone  manually or with  another application , we need to refresh the catalog from time to time. This can be  done with the Reindex tab available in the content-edit mode. The process starts  immediately and displays a status message on successful processing. The reindex  action is protected by the Add Filesystem Object permission. This permission is  available for the Manager and the Owner role in the default setup. We may set up a  special user and a cron job what does the indexing for us regularly.  If we want to avoid the indexing of the data, there is the Show live data option  available for the Reflector. With this option set, the data of the filesystem is always   in sync, but  there always is a "but"  the data is not put in the catalog of Plone. This  means that the filesystem contents cannot be searched, but can only be viewed directly.  Publisher hooks All the storage solutions we have seen so far have one thing in common: They all  use the publishing engine of Zope. Actually, they have one more thing in common,  which is the storage of the binary content on the filesystem. But this behavior is  shared by the following solution too. So what is different then?  Usually, the ZServer of Zope—responsible for handling the web traffic—is not  exposed to the Internet directly, but is proxied by a dedicated web server such as  Apache, Ngnix, or lighttpd. The approach of the following section takes this fact  into account. It hooks into the proxy and with certain control flags in the request it  catches the binary data, stores it on the filesystem, and passes on a key to the CMS.  This key is later used for identification of the file if it is requested for download.  There is another solution that works with the publisher hook technology: WSGI   Web Server Gateway Interface . This is a Python standard for combining  middleware components and applications for web publishing. For the handling of  binary files, there is a WSGI component z3c.extfile. This component was written  for Zope3 exclusively and was never released officially. Additionally, the WSGI  support for Plone is still experimental. Pasting these two experimental components  together probably means a lot of effort. Let's investigate a more stable solution.  [ 268 ]   Chapter 9  The Tramline publisher hook product Tramline is a filter for the mod_python module of Apache. This means Apache is the  only web server with which this technique works. We need at least version 2.0.55 of the  web server. Version 2.0.54 and below do not work due to a bug in the mod_proxy filter  handling. The mod_proxy module is used for passing the incoming requests to Zope.  Additionally, we need the mod_rewrite and mod_python modules. mod_rewrite does  the rewriting of the URLs for the VirtualHostMonster of Zope. It is needed anyway if  we use Apache as a frontend for Zope and it is not a special requirement of Tramline.  Tramline setup preparations There are some things we have to do before we can go on. We have to patch  mod_python. With this patch the filter is not flushed. The patch needs to be done  in the apache.py file of the mod_python library, which is usually found in the site  packages directory of the python system. For the latest version  3.3.1  of mod_python,  this is line 249 and line 250, and the method is FilterDispatch:      else:         result = object filter        always flush the filter. without a FLUSH or EOS bucket,      the content is never written to the network.      XXX an alternative is to tell the user to flush   always     if not filter.closed:          filter.flush    except SERVER_RETURN, value:  We need a repository. The repository is a directory with two subdirectories  upload  and repository . This directory is referred to as the tramline storage or tramline  path in the following text and the original Tramline documentation. While uploading  a file, it is written to the upload directory first. It is moved over to repository  directory after the transaction is finished successfully.  We need to make sure both processes  Zope and Apache  can access the tramline  storage. A good way is to have a group that is shared by both processes and has  write permissions to the directory.  Before we go on with installing the Tramline product, it is worth noticing that the  Python version for mod_python and Tramline does not need to be the same Python  version that Zope uses. Usually, if we use the Apache web server provided by the  OS, the Python version for mod_python and Tramline will be the system one too,  and the version for Zope will be a self-compiled Python 2.4.  [ 269 ]   Advanced Storage  The version of Tramline we use depends on the Apache version we are using.  Apache 2.0.x works with the released version  0.5.1  of Tramline. The 2.2.x series  needs the unreleased version 0.6 of Tramline. Installing the released version can be  done with:  $ easy_install tramline This command needs to be executed with the same Python version as   mod_python uses.  Double-check the Python version you are using for every step if working  with Tramline!  A little more manual work is needed for installing Tramline 0.6:  $ svn export http:  codespeak.net svn rr tramline trunk  tramline  $ cd tramline  $ python bdist_egg  $ cd dist  $ easy_install tramline-0.6-py2.5.egg Again, this needs to be done with the same Python version as mod_python uses.  The name of the egg might vary depending on the version.  Configuring Apache for Tramline Configuring Apache is straightforward. Providing mod_python on our system may  hide some difficulties. If we are lucky, the support is compiled in the versions of  Python and Apache, which are shipped with the operating system. If not, we have to  compile it ourselves. This procedure varies with the operating system we are using.  To enable mod_python in the Apache configuration, we have to add the following  line to the httpd.conf file:  LoadModule python_module  usr libexec apache2 mod_python.so  The location of the mod_python.so file may vary slightly on different systems.  The next step is to include the Tramline configuration on the Apache side:  PythonInputFilter tramline.core::inputfilter TRAMLINE_INPUT   PythonOutputFilter tramline.core::outputfilter TRAMLINE_OUTPUT   SetInputFilter TRAMLINE_INPUT   SetOutputFilter TRAMLINE_OUTPUT   PythonOption tramline_path  var tramline files  [ 270 ]   The last line defines where files should be put on our filesystem. In our example, we  assume this is  var tramline files.  If we have not done so already, we need to set up the rewrite rule for Zope. A good  place to put this is a virtual host directive, but the Apache top-level configuration   can be used for testing purposes   Chapter 9  RewriteEngine On  RewriteRule ^  .*  \ http:  127.0.0.1:8080 VirtualHostBase \ http localhost:80 site VirtualHostRoot $1 [L,P]  To make the configuration active, we need to reload it:  sudo apachectl configtest  sudo apachectl graceful Depending on the system, these two commands may look different. On a RedHat   Fedora, CentOS  system, they look like this:   sbin service httpd configtest   sbin service httpd graceful If the reload runs successfully, we have finished with Apache. We may check the  error logs of Apache to see if any abnormalities occurred. Then we move over to   the Plone part.   Configuring Plone for Tramline The use of Tramline is not limited to Plone. It can be used with virtually any web  application that can be proxied by Apache. What Tramline does is to parse and  extract the binary part of a form post, and save it on a given path with a generated  unique ID. Then it passes on the unique ID to the application, that is in charge to  store it. If the resource is requested later, the application returns the key in the  request header tramline_id together with the request variable tramline_ok. The  presence of these values will trigger Tramline to attach the binary content from the  file repository to the request.  The application, Plone in our case, needs a mechanism to store the keys and send the  correct request headers for binary data. There are two products available that deal  with the integration of Tramline into Plone. One is PloneTramline and the other  is attramline. While PloneTramline provides a patch for the existing File type,  attramline aims more at developers. It provides a field and a widget to be included  into custom types. Using these components enables Tramline for the field data.  [ 271 ]   Advanced Storage  Both products are rather rough at the edges. They seem to be more on the proof-of- concept side than stable products for production environments. Nevertheless, they  provide examples for an interaction of Plone with Tramline. The core functionality  works, but most of it is done via monkey patching. Rewriting the code with the use  of event subscribers and other modern approaches is worth considering if Tramline  is to be used together with a recent version of Plone. Using attramline to integrate with Tramline As said before attramline is a developer product, which mainly provides a field  and a widget. These components handle the request variables that are necessary for  the communication with Tramline in the background. They provide an API that is  similar to the file field and widget from the Archetypes product. There is no eggified version available of the attramline product. It has to be  included via the distros recipe:  [buildout] ....  [productdistros] recipe = plone.recipe.distros urls = http:  plone.org products attramline releases 1.0          attramline-1.0.tar.gz  [instance] recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance .... products =   ${buildout:directory} products   ${productdistros:location}  Of course, we need to rerun the buildout and restart the instance. But before we  can actually use the product, we have to check the Tramline version we are using  again. If we use version 0.5.1 of Tramline, we have to patch it to work together with  attramline. This patch adds the processing of an additional request header variable   explicit_enable . Doing this allows bypassing tramline in certain situations. We  execute the patch with the following command:  cd  path to tramline-egg-0.5.1  patch <  path to attramline tramline_explicit.patch The current developer version 0.6 of Tramline does NOT need this patch. It is  included already.  [ 272 ]   After we have restarted the instance, we install attramline as an add-on.  This will add the Tramline-enabled example, the TypeWithTramlineSupport  content type, and will set up the tramline_tool on the site. In this tool, we have  to set the tramline storage path as a property. This is necessary for deletion of  Tramline-enabled content. If such a content object gets deleted, the corresponding  binary part gets removed directly without using Apache.  Chapter 9  The tramline storage path needs to be the same as is set in the Apache configuration.  After this, we are done with the configuration and may add a Tramline-enabled  content object. The example provided is very rough, but includes the necessary parts.  The ID is not normalized, only the bare minimum of information is stored, and there  is no nice GUI provided for the content objects.  The binary content is only served as expected if Apache with Tramline  is used. Using the ZServer directly in a test environment will store the  binary content in the ZODB and will only return the storage key for  already tramlined objects.   [ 273 ]   Advanced Storage  After adding some files, the repository looks like this:  Including the field and the widget in custom products is straightforward. For  importing, the API is exposed via the public module in the attramline product.  Here is the example, TypeWithTramlineSupport, which is provided by the product:  from Products.Archetypes.public import * from Products.attramline.public import TramlineField, TramlineWidget from Products.attramline.config import PROJECTNAME  Besides the Archetypes API import, the TramlineField and TramlineWidget are  imported from the attramline product.  schema = BaseSchema+Schema       TramlineField 'tramlineFile'     Next, the schema for the Archetypes-based content type is defined. It uses the  BaseSchema from Archetypes and adds a TramlineField named tramlineFile. A  better version of this code would use a copy of the BaseSchema rather than using the  BaseSchema itself like this:  schema = BaseSchema.copy   + Schema             TramlineField 'tramlineFile'     class TypeWithTramlineSupport BaseContent :     """A simple archetype with Tramline support"""     schema = schema     archetype_name = meta_type = "TypeWithTramlineSupport"     portal_type = 'TypeWithTramlineSupport'  registerType TypeWithTramlineSupport, PROJECTNAME   Finally, we define and register the content type. The base is the BaseContent object  taken from Archetypes using the previously defined schema.  [ 274 ]   Using PloneTramline to integrate with Tramline The PloneTramline product patches the File content type to use Tramline instead of  the standard ZODB storage. The product is not available as an egg on PyPi. There is  an alpha version of the product available on www.plone.org, which can be included  in the distros section of the buildout:  Chapter 9  [buildout] ....  [productdistros] recipe = plone.recipe.distros urls = http:  plone.org products plonetramline releases 0.1          plonetramline-0-1.tgz  [instance] recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance .... products =   ${buildout:directory} products   ${productdistros:location}  Before the product can be actually used, the tramline path needs to be set manually.  There is a file, filefield_patch.py, in the top level of the product. In this file, the  REPOSITORY_PATH variable needs to be set to the tramline storage path:  REPOSITORY_PATH = " var tramline files"  To make the product installable with Plone 3, some manual work needs to be done   in the Extensions Install.py file.  from Products.CMFCore.TypesTool import ContentFactoryMetadata from Products.CMFCore.DirectoryView import addDirectoryViews from Products.CMFCore.utils import getToolByName from Products.CMFCore.CMFCorePermissions import ManagePortal from Products.CMFCore.permissions import ManagePortal  The ContentFactoryMetadata import needs to be commented out or removed. It is  not used in the module and the import fails in Plone 3.3. Further, the import location  of the ManagePortal permission needs to be changed. Since Plone 3.0, the location  for the permissions constants has been Products.CMFCore.permissions and not  Products.CMFCore.CMFCorePermissions any longer.  [ 275 ]   Advanced Storage  When restarting the instance, the monkey patches are logged:  2009-12-07 13:58:08 INFO Archetypes  Users tom plone  parts  productdistros PloneTramline filefield_patch.py[33]:?

NOTICE: patched Archetypes.Field.FileField.get_size for tramline  The product is now installable as an add-on. From then on, the standard File  content type is Tramline enabled. The change is obvious if we upload a text file.  PloneTramline stores the Tramline key as content of the File object. Because the  GUI is not changed by the product, we can see this behavior by uploading a text   file with the .txt extension. If we call the view the Tramline key is shown and if  we trigger the download proxied by Apache the real content is served.   See the file view in the following screenshot:  [ 276 ]   Chapter 9  Summary In this chapter we have seen some storage mechanisms we can use with Plone.  We started with explaining storage in the ZODB and the storage mechanism of  Archetypes, the default content framework of Plone. The advantage of the default  setting is the unisolution. We have one storage place for everything: objects, binary  data, templates, scripts, and so on. Unfortunately, the performance is bad for large  amounts of binary data. That's why we looked for alternatives. The first one we  found was ExternalStorage. This is very easy to set up and provides a new storage  for binary data in custom products. A similar but more configurable approach is  FileSystemStorage. This solution is preferable, if we have more than one Plone site  in the ZODB. Another goodie of the product is that it allows patching the existing  content types dealing with BLOB content. Talking about BLOB content takes us to another solution: plone.app.blob.  This solution is preferable if we want to look into the future. The product, which uses   a new low-level feature of the ZODB, is relatively new and has still some edges. It  has stabilized recently as it will be the default storage for binary content in Plone 4.  A completely different approach is Reflecto. This product provides a content type  that acts as a window into the filesystem. This product can be combined with the  others, and is good if we need to preserve the names of our files and or share data  on the filesystem with other applications.  Finally, we investigated the publisher hook product Tramline. In contrast to all  the other solutions, this approach does not use the publisher of Zope, but hooks  in the publishing process itself. Binary data are grabbed and attached from to the  request when they are needed. This solution takes some effort to set up because  we need Apache with mod_python and need to patch some code. Nevertheless,  its performance is outstanding and outperforms all other solutions. So if we need  something really efficient, the effort of setting up Tramline might be worth it.  [ 277 ]    Serving and Caching  In the last chapter of the book, we want to put out a feeler for applications and tools  outside of Plone to improve the multimedia experience. We already have seen some  techniques in the previous chapter, where we stored large binary data outside the  ZODB or let them be served with a web server. In this chapter, we want to go further  and investigate some other hosting scenarios usable with Plone.  Plone does not provide a responsive user experience out of the box. This is not  because the system is slow, but because it simply does  too  much. It does a lot of  security checks and workflow operations, handles the content rules, does content  validation, and so on. Still, there are some high-traffic sites running with the popular  Content Management System. How do they manage?  "All Plone integrators are caching experts." This saying is commonly heard and read  in the Plone community. And it is true. If we want a fast and responsive system, we  have to use caching and load-balancing applications to spread the load. The tool of the day for caching on the application layer is Varnish. Varnish is a  reverse proxy designed to cache web content effectively in memory and on the   disk. In this chapter, we will learn how to install and configure this application   with a buildout.  For communicating with Varnish  or with any other caching application , Plone  provides a bundle of products called CacheFu. We will see how to fine-tune the  caching of content with this solution.  The second part of this chapter is reserved for another practical example. We will set  up a protected video-on-demand solution with Plone and a Red5 server. The Red5  server is an open source Flash server. We will see how to integrate it with Plone for  an effective and secure video-streaming solution.   Serving and Caching  In this last chapter we will cover:   	 How to integrate and configure the caching server Varnish into a    Plone buildout   	 How to set and manipulate caching headers with CacheFu  	 How to install, configure, and use the Red5 Flash server for streaming   protected videos managed by Plone on demand  The caching server Varnish Varnish is probably the number-one caching application today in the context of  the use of Plone. Varnish can be easily integrated into a buildout. It does not need  any special rights to be run and can be started with the same system user on which  Plone runs, or with a separate one. After reading the configuration and creating a  storage file, Varnish switches to an unprivileged user  usually nobody  before it takes  any requests.  To get a running application, we need to add two parts to our buildout. One builds  the application from the sources and the other one configures it. In our examples,  these parts are named varnish-build and varnish-instance. The zc.recipe.cmmi recipe downloads a source tarball from an URL, extracts  it, and calls the famous configure, make, and make install commands to  build the sources.  [varnish-build] recipe = zc.recipe.cmmi url = ${varnish-instance:download-url}  This recipe configures Varnish. It will listen on port 8000 and have a cache size of 1  gigabyte. It is of the job of the internal structure of Varnish to decide what part of this  amount is in the memory and what is on the disk. The ratio changes during runtime.  There is a cache size limit of 2 gigabytes on 32-bit systems.  [varnish-instance] recipe = plone.recipe.varnish daemon = ${buildout:parts-directory} varnish-build sbin varnishd bind = 127.0.0.1:8000 cache-size = 1G backends =    VirtualHostBase http www.example.org:80 site:127.0.0.1:8080  [ 280 ]   Chapter 10  Varnish parses the request URL for the  VirtualHostBase http www.mysite. com:80 site:127.0.0.1:8080 pattern and redirects this to our Plone site site  with the Zope server listening on port 8080. To run Varnish, we use the shortcut script in the bin directory of the buildout:  $ bin varnish-instance The name of the script is the name of the buildout configuration part.  Note that you have to use launchd instead of the built-in  daemon on the Mac OS X system. There is a blog entry on  http:  tomster.org blog nginx-and-varnish- on-mac-os-x showing how to do this. It is always possible  to run Varnish in the foreground by using the -F option.  Another variant is to use a supervisor to daemonize the  caching application.  Using Varnish Varnish comes with a set of tools to interact with the caching process. This helps to  keep the core lightweight. Even the logging runs in its own process. In the buildout,  these tools can be found in the parts varnish-build bin directory.

In the log, all the  header information and everything Varnish does with the data is listed for  debugging purposes. For these bits of information, the VCL_ entries are important.  For example, if a hit occurs, the data is taken from the cache. There is a flowchart  on http:  varnish.projects.linpro.no wiki VCLExampleDefault showing  the possible paths a request response might take.  To use other tools for debugging the Varnish actions, we can set the   verbose-headers property to on in the buildout:  [varnish-instance] recipe = plone.recipe.varnish verbose-headers = on  This will add the X-Varnish-Action response header containing the action that  Varnish executed before.  To customize the behavior of Varnish, and configure the conditions and actions   for the event hooks of the application, VCL  Varnish Configuration Language   is used. If we use the plone.recipe.varnish buildout recipe, it will take care  of creating a VCL configuration for us. It can be found in the parts  varnish-instance varnish.vcl file.  The recipe provides another way to specify a configuration file.  [varnish-instance] recipe = plone.recipe.varnish config = ${buildout:directory} etc myvarnish.vcl  If we decide to use this method to configure Varnish, we cannot specify the   backends and the verbose-headers directive.  If we start the machinery now, Varnish will cache all the JavaScript and CSS  resources and the icon images. We probably want to fine-tune this behavior a little  bit. For Plone, we use the CacheFu bundle to achieve this.  [ 283 ]   Serving and Caching  Setting caching headers with CacheFu The number-one solution for caching content in Plone is CacheFu. CacheFu  is a product bundle consisting of the four packages: Products.CacheSetup,  Products.CMFSquidTool, Products.PageCacheManager, and Products. PolicyHTTPCacheManager. CacheFu does a number of things to speed up Plone.  In the first place, it patches the template engine to cache the rendered templates  in memory. Additionally, it comes with a complex set of configuration options for  setting caching headers for external caching applications such as Varnish or Squid. To install CacheFu, we simply need to add the CacheSetup egg to our buildout. This  egg depends on all other eggs of the bundle and takes care of installing them too.  [instance] recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance zope2-location = ${zope2:location} user = admin:admin http-address = 8080 eggs =      Plone     Products.CacheSetup zcml =  No further action than running the buildout, restarting the instance, and installing  the CacheSetup add-on has to be done.  Configuring CacheFu To configure CacheFu, there is a configlet in the control panel of Plone—Cache  Configuration Tool. The main configuration screen looks like this:  [ 284 ]   Chapter 10  [ 285 ]   Serving and Caching  To actually use CacheFu for setting caching headers, it needs to be enabled. Then  we have to set a policy. In CacheSetup 1.2.1, there are two policies available: With  Caching Proxy and Without Caching Proxy. If we have Varnish  or Squid  and  Plone to choose from, we choose With Caching Proxy. Policies are sets of rules and  can be managed from the Policies tab from the CacheFu management page. With the Proxy Cache Purge Configuration, we set the method for constructing  purge URLs for the caching application. If the content is modified in Plone CacheFu,  it sends a purge request to Varnish in order to tell it that this data is updated and  needs to be removed from the cache. Depending on the architecture, the value of this  field is one of the following options:   	 No Purge  zope-only, or zope-behind-apache : We choose this option   if we don't use a reverse proxy cache. This will rarely be the case in a  production environment.   	 Simple Purge  squid varnish in front : This option is reserved for setups with   only a reverse proxy cache in front of Plone, and no web server included.  	 Purge with VHM URLs  squid varnish behind apache, VHM virtual   hosting : This option is for the most common setup: Internet  web  server  reverse proxy cache  Zope Plone.   	 Purge with custom URLs  squid varnish behind apache, custom virtual  hosting : This option is similar to the previous one, but is meant for more  complex scenarios. It can be used if we do inside-out hosting  with the _vh_  marker in the rewrite rule , or if we have more than one Plone site in our  ZODB. If using this option, we need to provide a rewritePurgeUrls script.  There is an example in the cache_setup skin, which can be customized.  The Site Domains field takes all the domains from which the site is reachable. We  need to make sure that all possible domains are listed and that the port is included  for each entry. The Proxy Cache Domains field takes the URL of the reverse proxy cache. If it is  on the same machine as Plone, this can be "localhost" instead of the external address.  We need to make sure to include the port here, too. With the Compression field, it is possible to enable the gzip compression of pages  before delivering them. Some load balancers  such as HAProxy  have problems with  compressed pages. If the architecture allows it, turning on this value may increase  performance because the amount of data sent over the network is smaller. The  possible values are:   	 Never: Turns off compression completely  	 Always: Turns on compression always  [ 286 ]   Chapter 10   	 Use Accept-Encoding header: Turns on compression if the browser explicitly   allows it   	 Use Accept-Encoding and User-Agent headers: Like the previous option,    turns off compression of data for some Netscape legacy browsers  The Vary Header field value indicates the set of request header fields that fully  determine whether a cache is permitted to use the response to reply to a subsequent  request without revalidation.  The power of CacheFu lies in the fine-grained manipulation of the caching headers.  We have three points to hook into. The first starting point is policies. As said before,  policies are sets of rules. If the two predefined policies do not match our needs,  which will hardly ever be the case, we can define our own. We can add, remove, and  rename policies under the Policies tab of the CacheFu management page. If we create a new policy, it is empty. We need to add rules. To manipulate the rules  associated with a policy, we use the Rules tab. Rules are the conditions under which  certain caching headers are set. As Plone is a content-centric CMS, these conditions  usually correspond with certain content types. Probably the most interesting rule  for multimedia content from the With Caching Proxy policy is Files & Images. It is  not hard to guess that this rule sets the caching header for objects of the File and the  Image content types. Let's see what we have:  Rules may set different headers for authenticated and anonymous access of an object.  For Files and Image content, there is a custom expression for both types:  python:object.portal_cache_settings.canAnonymousView object  and  'cache-in-proxy-24-hours' or 'no-cache'   This expression tells CacheFu to set the cache-in-proxy-24-hours header if the file  is anonymously accessible, and the no-cache header otherwise. To manipulate headers, there is a Headers tab in the CacheFu configuration. The  most common use cases for caching content in the browser and in the proxy cache  are shipped with the product. The cache-in-proxy-24-hours header sets the  s-maxage header to 86400. The no-cache header sets the private flag, which tells the  proxy not to cache this item.  [ 287 ]   Serving and Caching  Red5: A video-on-demand Flash server In the last chapter we talked about linking content. This technique has the advantage  that both storage and publishing are external, and do not put any load on Plone. The  downside of this method is that protecting content with permissions is not possible  in any way.  Is it really? There is this tool called Red5, which is an open source Flash server. It is  written in Java and is very extensible via plugins. There are plugins for transcoding,  different kinds of streaming, and several other manipulations we might want to do  with video or audio content. What we want to investigate here is how to integrate  video streams protected by Plone permissions.  Requirements for setting up a Red5 server The requirement for running a Red5 Flash server is Java 6. We can check the Java  version by running this:  $ java –version  java version "1.6.0_17"  Java TM  SE Runtime Environment  build 1.6.0_17-b04-248-9M3125   Java HotSpot TM  64-Bit Server VM  build 14.3-b01-101, mixed mode  The version needs to be 1.6 at least. The earlier versions of the Red5 server run with  1.5, but the plugin for protecting the media files needs Java 6. To get Java 6, if we do  not have it already, we can download it from the Sun home page. There are packages  available for Windows and Linux.  Some Linux distributions have different implementations of Java because  of licensing issues. You may check the corresponding documentation if  this is the case for you.  Mac OS X ships with its own Java bundled. To set the Java version to 1.6 on Mac OS  X, we need to do the following:  $ cd  System Library Frameworks JavaVM.framework Versions  $ rm Current*  $ ln –s 1.6 Current  $ ln –s 1.6 CurrentJDK After doing so, we should double-check the Java version with the command   shown before.  [ 288 ]   Chapter 10  The Red5 server is available as a package for various operating systems. In the next  section, we will see how we can integrate a Red5 server into a Plone buildout.  A Red5 buildout Red5 can be downloaded in several different ways. As it is open source, even the  sources are available as a tarball from the product home page. For the buildout, we  use the bundle of ready compiled Java libraries. This bundle comes with everything  needed to run a standalone Red5 server. There are startup scripts provided for  Windows and Bash  usable with Linux and Mac OS X . Let's see how to configure  our buildout.   The buildout needs the usual common elements for a Plone 3.3.3 installation. Apart  from the application and the instance, the Red5-specific parts are also present: a fss  storage part and a part for setting up the supervisor.  [buildout] newest = false parts =     zope2     instance     fss     red5     red5-webapp     red5-protectedVOD     supervisor extends =      http:  dist.plone.org release 3.3.3 versions.cfg versions = versions  find-links =     http:  dist.plone.org release 3.3.3     http:  dist.plone.org thirdparty     http:  pypi.python.org simple   There is nothing special in the zope2 application part.  [zope2] recipe = plone.recipe.zope2install fake-zope-eggs = true url = ${versions:zope2-url}  [ 289 ]   Serving and Caching  On the Plone side, we need—despite of the fss eggs—a package called  unimr.red5.protectedvod. This package with the rather complicated  name creates rather complicated one-time URLs for the communication with Red5.  [instance] recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance zope2-location = ${zope2:location} user = admin:admin http-address = 8080 eggs =      Plone     unimr.red5.protectedvod     iw.fss zcml =     unimr.red5.protectedvod     iw.fss     iw.fss-meta  [fss] recipe = iw.recipe.fss zope-instances =    ${instance:location} storages =   global     site  site site2  First, we need to configure FileSystemStorage. FileSystemStorage is used for  sharing the videos between Plone and Red5. The videos are uploaded via the Plone  UI and they are put on the filesystem. The storage strategy needs to be either site1  or site2. These two strategies store the binary data with its original filename and file  extension. The extension is needed for the Red5 server to recognize the file.  The red5 part downloads and extracts the Red5 application. We have to envision  that everything is placed into the parts directory. This includes configurations,  plugins, logs, and even content. We need to be extra careful with changing the recipe  in the buildout if running in production mode. The content we share with Plone is  symlinked, so this is not a problem. For the logs, we might change the position to  outside the parts directory and symlink them back.  [red5] recipe = hexagonit.recipe.download url = http:  www.red5.org downloads 0_8 red5-0.8.0.tar.gz  [ 290 ]   Chapter 10  The next part adds our custom application, which handles the temporary links used  for protection, to the Red5 application. The plugin is shipped together with the  unimr.red5.protectedvod egg we use on the Plone side. It is easier to get it from  the Subversion repository directly.  [red5-webapp] recipe = infrae.subversion urls = http:  svn.plone.org svn collective unimr.red5.protectedvod          trunk          unimr red5 protectedvod red5-webapp red5-webapp  The red5-protectedVOD part configures the protectedVOD plugin. Basically, the  WAR archive we checked out in the previous step is extracted. If the location of the  fss storage does not exist already, it is symlinked into the streams directory of the  plugin. The streams directory is the usual place for media files for Red5.   [red5-protectedVOD] recipe = iw.recipe.cmd on_install = true on_update = false cmds =      mkdir -p ${red5:location} webapps protectedVOD     cd ${red5:location} webapps protectedVOD     jar xvf ${red5-webapp:location}         red5-webapp protectedVOD_0.1-red5_0.8-java6.war     cd streams     if [ ! -L ${red5:location}              webapps protectedVOD streams fss_storage_site ];              then ln -s ${buildout:directory} var fss_storage_site .;              fi  The commands used above are Unix Linux centric. Until Vista  Server 2008, Windows didn't understand symbolic links. That's why  the whole idea of the recipe doesn't work. The recipe might work  with Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, or Windows 7; but the  commands look different.  Finally, we add the Red5 server to our supervisor configuration. We need to set the  RED5_HOME environment variable, so that the startup script can find the necessary  libraries of Red5.  [supervisor] recipe = collective.recipe.supervisor programs =   [ 291 ]   Serving and Caching  30 instance2 ${instance2:location} bin runzope ${instance2:location}  true   40 red5 env [RED5_HOME=${red5:location} ${red5:location} red5.sh]  ${red5:location} true   After running the buildout, we can start the supervisor by issuing the   following command:  bin supervisord The supervisor will take care of running all the subprocesses. To find out more  on the supervisor, we may visit its website: http:  supervisord.org manual  current index.html. To check if everything worked, we can request a status  report by issuing this:   bin supervisorctl status  instance            RUNNING    pid 2176, uptime 3:00:23  red5                RUNNING    pid 7563, uptime 0:51:25  Using Red5 To use Plone together with the Red5 server, we have to install two add-ons in  our site: iw.fss  FileSystemStorage  and unimr.red5.protectedvod setup. The  FileSystemStorage product allows Plone to store binary data on the filesystem  rather than in the ZODB  see the previous chapter for more information . The  protectedvod product does two things. It provides an API to create temporary  media links accessing the Red5 server, and it provides a simple content type. This  content type Red5Stream is similar to the File content type of Plone. It has a title,  a description, and a binary component. This binary component is stored on the  filesystem with the help of the FileSystemStorage. The directory of the filesystem  where the data is put is accessible from Plone and Red5. If a Red5Stream content  object is viewed, the data doesn't come from Plone or the FileSystemstorage,  but is streamed from the Red5 server with a specially created temporary link.  On the Plone side, the Red5 plugin can be configured with the following values:    	 red5_server_url: The complete URL of the protectedVOD plugin.   The default setting assumes the Zope server and the Red5 server run   on the same machine—rtmp:  localhost protectedVOD.   	 ttl: The time to live in seconds. This value sets how long a generated   video link is valid. The default value is 60.   	 secret: The password that is shared between Plone and the Red5 server.   Defaults to top_secret.  [ 292 ]   Chapter 10  The secret on the Red5 side is set in the red5-web.properties file, which is  stored in the WEB-INF directory of the protectedVOD plugin. The full path starting  from the buildout base is parts red5 webapps protectedVOD WEB-INF   red5-web.properties. The password is set with the sharedSecret property  like this:  webapp.contextPath= protectedVOD webapp.virtualHosts=*, localhost, localhost:5080, 127.0.0.1:5080 sharedSecret=top_secret provider=HmacMD5  The temporary URL The dynamically signed streaming URL takes the following format:  rtmp:    protectedVOD            The first part, rtmp:    protectedVOD, is defined by the  red5_server_url property of the Plone configuration. The other parts are  added as follows:   	 The rtmp protocol  Real Time Messaging Protocol  is a proprietary network   protocol developed by Adobe systems to transfer audio, video, and other  data to a Flash player over the Internet.   	 The baseURL is the relative path of the media content in the   FileSystemStorage.   	 The signature is calculated as follows: hmac.new secret + baseUrl  + streamName + client ip + expires .hexdigest  . The secret is  specified in the configuration of Plone and must match the value on the  Red5 server. More information on the hmac format can be found in the  documentation of the corresponding Python module.   	 expires is a timestamp given as a hex string. This is the number of seconds  since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 in hexadecimal notation plus the time to live   ttl  configured in Plone.   	 The streamName is the name of the video file, for example: dancing_clouds.  flv, funmovie.flv, or rocknroll.mp4. This part of the URL is optional.  An example URL is:  rtmp:  localhost protectedVOD fss_storage_site kleinesvideo.flv   27d8cbebbb446e95d158018e0e9d9c2f 4b264f22  [ 293 ]   Serving and Caching  In this example, the Zope server and the Red5 server are on the same machine. The  host in the URL points to localhost. The FileSystemStorage path is the standard  path for a Plone site called site  fss_storage_site  and the Flash video is called  kleinesvideo.flv. The hmac signature is 27d8cbebbb446e95d158018e0e9d9c2f  and the expires timestamp is 4b264f22. This timestamp corresponds to the date:  "Mon Dec 14 15:43:46 2009".  The Red5Stream content type The unimr.red5.protctedvod package comes with its own content type. The  content type is called Red5Stream, but there is nothing special about it. It inherits  the schema and the class from ATFile of ATContentTypes. All it does is override the  storage of the file field to make use of the FileSystemStorage. Also, it protects the  default and the download view with a custom permission DownloadRed5Stream.  This has the following effect: Users with a "view" permission can view the content  by the streaming technique of the Red5 server, but are not allowed to download the  content. By default, only clients with an owner or a manager role have the Download  Red5Stream permission to download the content from Plone.  Red5StreamSchema = ATFileSchema.copy    file_field = Red5StreamSchema['file'] file_field.storage = FileSystemStorage   file_field.registerLayer 'storage', file_field.storage  file_field.read_permission = DownloadRed5Stream  finalizeATCTSchema Red5StreamSchema   class Red5Stream ATFile :      implements IRed5Stream      portal_type    = 'Red5Stream'     archetype_name = 'Red5Stream'     inlineMimetypes= tuple        schema = Red5StreamSchema      security       = ClassSecurityInfo        security.declareProtected DownloadRed5Stream, 'index_html'      security.declareProtected DownloadRed5Stream, 'download'   The content type comes with a custom view—red5stream_view. This view  includes an instance of the flowplayer used for playing the stream fetched   from the Red5 server.  With the Flowplayer, it is possible to play FLV, H.264, and MP4-encoded video files,  as well as MP3-encoded audio files.   [ 294 ]   Chapter 10  Visual editor integration To make it easier to present Red5Streams within a Plone content item, unimr.red5. protectedvod comes with a dedicated Kupu paragraph style for video integration  into rich text. The technique is similar to that we have seen for collective. flowplayer.   1.  We insert the image we want to use as a splash image. We insert this   "inline"  rather than left right floating , preferably in its own paragraph.  Alternatively, we can also enter some text as a placeholder.  2.  We select the image  or placeholder text  and make it an internal link to a   red5stream content object we want to play.   3.  We select the Red5 Stream style from the styles dropdown.  We use this feature as shown in this screenshot:  [ 295 ]   Serving and Caching  Troubleshooting Red5 There are some problems we might run into while setting up a Red5 server.  Java version issues First, the Java version has to be at least 1.6.0. We have discussed already how to  check the Java version and how to upgrade it, if our dependency is not fulfilled.  Checking the logs A good starting point for troubleshooting is always the logs. In our buildout  environment, the logs are located in parts red5 log. There are two access logs,  an error log, a general log, and a log of our protectedVOD plugin. A successful  request of a video from Plone to Red5 looks like this in the protectedVOD.log:  2009-12-18 14:38:37,167 [main] DEBUG root -                           Starting up context protectedVOD 2009-12-18 14:40:05,911 [NioProcessor-1] INFO  unimr.vod.hmac.

There is a solution to this issue, which occurs on a default Mac OS X installation and  probably on other Unix systems too. We simply have to deactivate IPv6, which is  probably not used anyway. To switch off IPv6 for localhost, we have to comment  out the IPv6 addresses in the  etc hosts configuration file.  127.0.0.1       localhost 255.255.255.255 broadcasthost ::1            localhost  fe80::1%lo0    localhost  After doing this, we have to restart Red5 server to bind to the IPv4 interface and the  hash construction should work as expected. With supervisor, the command is:  bin supervisorctl restart red5 If we run the Red5 server and the Zope server on different machines, we have  to make sure the time of the both servers is in sync. Otherwise, the link may be  outdated before it is called.

We looked at the reverse  proxy cache Varnish and the video server Red5. The purpose of Varnish is to cache  certain resources of Plone to take the load of the publisher and the database access.  This speeds up the page rendering tremendously, especially for anonymous users.  We made a very short excursion on how to use CacheFu and set caching headers,  which can be used to manipulate the caching behavior of Varnish.  The second example we saw was the setup and use of the Red5 server. The main  purpose of this application is to serve streamed media data. We created a plugin on the  Red5 side and on the Plone side we created a video-on-demand solution that allows  the protection of video data by creating temporary links for accessing the streams.  And now it is time for us to build our own multimedia Plone site.  [ 299 ]    Multimedia Formats and  Licenses  In this part of the book, we will cover the details of the formats and codecs used   for the storage and transmission of audio and video content. Further, we will   look at the Creative Commons Licenses, which can be used to license open   multimedia  content.  This appendix collects the following information:   	 The most important audio formats together with some major lossy    and lossless audio codecs   	 A selection of video codecs and the codecs commonly used for     	 The Creative Commons Licenses conditions and some popular    web distribution  CC license models  Let's start with the definition of some key terms:   	 File format: "A file format is a particular way that information is encoded for   storage in a computer file." For media files, this can be the raw bitstream or  a dedicated container format. Usually, the name of a file format corresponds  with the extension of the filename. A common video file format is AVI   Audio Video Interleave .   	 Codec: A codec is a piece of software that compresses decompresses digital  audio video data according to a given file or streaming format. The objective  of a codec algorithm is to represent the high-fidelity audio video signal with  a minimum of data, while retaining its quality. The word "codec" is a blend  of the two words coder and decoder. A common audio codec is MP3  MPEG-1  Audio or MPEG-2 Audio layer III .   Multimedia Formats and Licenses  It is important to distinguish between file formats and codecs. A codec   performs the encoding and decoding of the raw audio data, while the   data itself is stored in a file with a specific audio file format.    	 Lossless: "Lossless data compression is a class of data compression   algorithms that allows the exact original data to be reconstructed from  the compressed data." A good example for a lossless format that is not  necessarily related to multimedia is the ZIP file format. All data that is  compressed with ZIP can be uncompressed without any loss of data.   	 Lossy: "A lossy compression method is one where compressing data and   then decompressing it retrieves data that is different from the original, but  is close enough to be useful in some way." This is a very general definition  because the subject is very general. Lossy codecs are available for many  different  multimedia  formats such as image, audio, and video data. A lossy  image codec is JPEG  Joint Photographic Experts Group . Similar colors  are grouped to rectangle blocks. Every time the file is saved, the encoding  process is repeated. This behavior changes the image and the original raw  image can't be reconstructed from a JPEG image.  Lossy audio codecs behave similarly, but are still different in certain   aspects. While lossy image codecs take into account what we see, lossy   audio codecs take into account what we hear. The investigation of this   topic is called psychoacoustics. That's why the definition is so generic.   Audio formats For storing audios, we have basically three choices:   	 Use the bitstream data raw  	 Encode the data with a lossless audio codec  	 Encode the data with a lossy audio-codec  The file format for raw audio bitstream data is WAV or AIFF. Though a WAV file  can hold compressed audio, the most common WAV format contains uncompressed  audio in the Linear pulse code modulation  LPCM  format. The standard audio file  format for CDs, for example, is LPCM encoded. It contains two channels of 44,100  samples per second and 16 bits per sample.  Another raw audio format is the "red book audio format". This format is the standard  for audio CDs  Compact Disc Digital Audio system, or CD DA . It is named after one  of the sets of color-bound books that contain the technical specifications for all CD  and CD ROM formats.  [ 302 ]   Appendix A  The advantages of storing audio data raw are clear. As there is no audio codec  involved, using the audio data is both fast and easy. It is available on all digital  systems because it does not need a decoder for processing. Additionally, the lack of a  codec makes loading and saving of audio files especially fast.  The downside of storing audio files with that method is the big file sizes. With  approximately 10 megabytes per minute of CD quality audio the raw format is not  our first choice for efficient storage and distribution of audio data as web content.  Luckily, we have two more options: lossless audio codecs and lossy audio codecs.  Lossless codecs Storing audio data with lossless codecs means constant sound quality with a smaller  file size compared with the original raw data. For transmitting audio over the  Internet, lossless codecs don't play a very important role mostly because of their still  big file size. They are mainly used for archiving audio.   The Free Lossless Audio Codec The Free Lossless Audio Codec, or short FLAC, is a lossless audio codec. It has  been around since about 2003. By compressing our audio data with FLAC, we gain  between 40 and 60 per cent on size. Unfortunately, mobile players do not commonly  support the format. Coding and decoding with FLAC is very fast, which makes it a  good choice for archiving high-quality audio data. FLAC is a codec and a file format.  Additionally, FLAC-encoded audio data can be stored in Ogg file containers too. The MIME type of FLAC is audio flac, audio x-flac or application x-flac.  Other lossless audio codecs Other lossless codecs include:   	 Shorten: A dated audio codec, which handles 44.1 kHz 16-bit stereo with a  low complexity algorithm. The file extension of the shortened encoded files   is .shn.   	 Apple Lossless  Apple Lossless Encoding or Apple Lossless Audio Codec    ALAC  : The ALAC is a codec for the MP4 container format.   	 Adaptive Transform Acoustic Coding  ATRAC —Advanced Lossless: This   codec is used as the native encoding for MiniDisc and is supported by  other Sony products such as PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, and digital  Walkmans too.   [ 303 ]   Multimedia Formats and Licenses   	 Meridian Lossless Packing  MLP : The MLP codec is a possible encoder   for audio tracks on DVDs. An MLP variant  Dolby TrueHD  is used for the  audio encoding of Blu-ray Discs.   	 Monkey's Audio  APE : The APE codec is a lossless codec with checksums   for error detection in the data and very good compression rates.   	 MPEG-4 Audio Lossless Coding  ALS : The MPEG-4 ALS coded is an   extension to the MPEG-4 audio standard. It's development was finished   in 2005.   	 OptimFROG: OptimFROG is a closed source freeware codec. It provides a   hybrid mode, which allows the reconstruction of the original file with a lossy  encoded file and a correction file.   	 TAK Tom's lossless audio compressor: The freeware TAK codec is a fast   lossless codec with high compression rates.   	 WavPack  WV WVC : The WavPack codec is included in the Winzip   program and used for packing raw WAV files.   	 Windows Media Audio Lossless  WMA Lossless : WMA lossless is a lossless   codec developed by Microsoft. The Windows Media Player from version 9  supports it, but no mobile device supports it.  Most of these codecs are closed source and or proprietary. They were designed  to fulfill some special use cases, or to be included into existing  audio  software  or operating systems such as ALAC for Apple Mac OS X or WMA Lossless for  Microsoft Windows.  Lossy codecs Lossy codecs, as said earlier, lose information when the audio data is coded. This  information is sound that is not hearable by humans and is therefore treated as  unnecessary and cropped.   Probably one of the most famous and widespread lossy codecs is MP3.  [ 304 ]   Appendix A  MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 The correct name of the music format MP3 is MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3. It is a patented  digital audio format and was designed by the Moving Pictures Experts Group. The  design goals were to greatly reduce the data used to represent the audio data while  preserving a good audio quality to most listeners. The format shrinks audio data to  about 1 10th of the original size and has become a de facto standard for processing  digital audio. It is widely used for streaming purposes and as a storage format for  mobile music players. For Internet applications, this is probably the format of choice  simply because it is capable of streaming, is small, and is widely supported by server  and client software. MP3 is a file format too. The MIME type of MP3 is audio mpeg.  Ogg Vorbis The Ogg format is a container format designed to store all kinds of multimedia data.  As for audio, the Vorbis codec is mostly used. There are two file extensions that are  used for classifying Ogg encoded audio data. They are .ogg and .oga.  The Vorbis format is a lossy audio format. It was designed as a free and open  source alternative for the proprietary MP3. One focus from the beginning was on  streaming support for the audio data. Many recent digital audio players support  .ogg these days.  The Ogg container format can be used to store FLAC-encoded data as well.  The MIME type of Ogg Vorbis is audio ogg or application ogg.  Other lossy codecs Besides MP3 and Ogg Vorbis, there are a number of other lossy audio codecs  available. Here is a list of some important ones:   	 AAC: AAC is a lossy audio codec developed by the MPEG workgroup ISO,  Moving Picture Experts Group. It is a redesign of the MPEG-2 Multichannel  format. The MIME types of AAC are audio AAC and audio AACP.   	 ATRAC: ATRAC is the lossy sibling of the lossless ATRAC codec from Sony.  	 Dolby AC-3  also Dolby Digital and ATSC A 52 : Dolby AC-3 is a   multichannel codec from the Dolby Company. It is used for movies    cinema , laserdiscs, DVDs, Blu-rays, and in television. It supports   up to six individual channels.  [ 305 ]   Multimedia Formats and Licenses   	 MP2  MPEG-1 Layer 2 Audio Codec : MP2 is a lossy codec also known as  MUSICAM. While it was superseded by MP3 in the PC and Internet area,   it is still the dominant format for digital broadcasting. It is part of the   DAB and DVB standard. Sometimes it is used on DVDs.   	 Musepack: Musepack is a lossy codec optimized for high bitrates and good   sound quality.   	 WMA: WMA is a proprietary audio codec of Microsoft and part of the   Windows Media Platform. It supports up to 7.1 channels.  Like most lossless codecs, these lossy codecs are proprietary formats with   patent restrictions. They are used for various special purposes  for example, as   audio channel for DVDs, such as Dolby, AC-3 or similar . Some of them are linked   to special operating systems such as MS Windows or Mac OS X. They are seldom  used for Internet distribution, as they often need special players or plugins that are  not widespread.  Video formats The landscape of video formats and codecs is more complex than its audio sibling.  This is due to the fact that video itself is more complex than audio. Videos usually  contain visual data and audio. A common approach separates the visual information  from the acoustic information. This allows using the normal audio codecs for the  audio data and dedicated visual codecs for the video data.  Lossless codecs Lossless video codecs are commonly used for video capturing and editing.  For the use as Internet content, the file size is usually too big.   	 Huffyuv: Huffyuv  or HuffYUV  is a very fast, lossless Win32 video    codec published under the terms of the GPL as free software.   	 Lagarith: A more up-to-date fork of the Huffyuv-codec is available    as Lagarith.  [ 306 ]   Appendix A  MPEG-4 Part 2 codecs This type of codec is very widespread. The compression ratio is very good and the  encoding can be done very fast. For most of these codecs, there is encoding and  decoding software available for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. The different types  of codecs are:   	 DivX Pro Codec: A proprietary MPEG-4 ASP codec made by DivX Inc.  	 Xvid: Free open source implementation of MPEG-4 ASP, originally based    on the OpenDivX project.   	 FFmpeg MPEG-4: Included in the open source libavcodec codec library,   which is used by default for decoding and or encoding in many open source  video players, frameworks, editors, and encoding tools such as MPlayer,  VLC, ffdshow, or GStreamer. Compatible with other standards of MPEG-4  codecs such as Xvid or DivX Pro Codec. 3ivx: A commercial MPEG-4 codec created by 3ivx Technologies.   	  H.264 MPEG-4 AVC codecs An implementation of the H.264 codec was meant to be the Internet codec. There  have been discussions about adding it to the HTML5 specification. Unfortunately,  patents protect it and the browser manufacturers are not able to or are not willing to  pay the patent fees. For this reason, probably no codec will be specified together with  HTML5 and every browser may choose its own video format and codec.  The H.264 codec has a lot of use cases:   	 HDTV: H.264 is one of the compulsory encodings of the HD DVD and    Blue-ray disc standards.   	 Portable video: The competing mobile television standards DVB-H and   DMB use H.264 for the video encoding for mobile clients such as phones   and PDAs. The fifth generation of the iPod and the Apple iPhone can play  H.264 videos.   	 Multimedia: Apple ships its multimedia framework, QuickTime, with    the H.264 codec since version 7.   	 Videoconferences: Some videoconference systems  iChat  use the     	 Video digicams: Many digital cameras support the H.264 encoding for    H.264 codec.  video recording.  [ 307 ]   Multimedia Formats and Licenses  There are different implementations of the codec:    	 x264: A GPL-licensed implementation of the H.264 encoding standard.     	 Nero Digital: Commercial MPEG-4 ASP and AVC codecs developed by    x264 is only an encoder.  Nero AG.   	 QuickTime H.264: H.264 implementation released by Apple.  	 DivX Pro Codec: An H.264 decoder and encoder were added in version 7.  Microsoft codecs The company from Redmond ships its own bundle of video codecs. There are  different codecs for different purposes and different qualities. Some open source  players  such as VLC  can decode these formats.    	 WMV  Windows Media Video : Microsoft's family of video codec   designs including WMV 7, WMV 8, and WMV 9. It can do anything  from low-resolution video for dial-up Internet users to HDTV. The latest  generation of WMV is standardized by SMPTE as the VC-1 standard.   	 MS MPEG-4v3: A proprietary and not MPEG-4 compliant video codec   created by Microsoft. It was released as a part of Windows Media Tools 4.   A hacked version of Microsoft's MPEG-4v3 codec became known as DivX.  Creative Commons Licenses The Creative Commons Licenses were created out of the need to:  ... provide free licenses and other legal tools to mark creative work with the freedom  the creator wants it to carry, so others can share, remix, use commercially, or any  combination thereof.  Open source licenses for software are common and available for some time now, and  have established well in the current software landscape. These licenses are targeted  at software and the legal needs that arise when publishing code to the community.  The Creative Commons Licenses are more generic and mainly aimed at content.  They don't restrict the type of the content. It can be any from books, images,  songs, movies, essays, web pages, designs, and so on. They are put together like a  construction kit. There are four relevant conditions, which can be mixed arbitrarily   to get a license deed.  [ 308 ]   License conditions The four conditions that are used as the basis for the license construction are:  Appendix A  1.  Attribution 2.  Share Alike 3.  Noncommercial 4.  No Derivative Works  Attribution  You let others copy, distribute, display, and perform your copyrighted work  and  derivative works based upon it , but only if they give credit the way you request.  What does "Attribute this work" mean?  The page you came from contained embedded licensing metadata, including how the  creator wishes to be attributed for reuse. You can use the license deeds provided on  the Creative Commons website  http:  creativecommons.org   to cite the work.  Doing so will also include metadata on your page so that others can find the original  work as well.   Share Alike  You allow others to distribute derivative works only under a license that is identical  to the license that governs your work.  [ 309 ]   Multimedia Formats and Licenses Noncommercial  You let others copy, distribute, display, and perform your work  and derivative  works based upon it , but for non-commercial purposes only.  No Derivative Works  You let others copy, distribute, display, and perform only verbatim copies of your  work; not derivative works based upon it.

[ 315 ]    Syndication Formats  As we have seen in the syndication chapter  Chapter 7, Content Syndication  already,  there are many formats and variants that can be used for syndication of multimedia  content. In this part, we will try to clarify this fuzzy situation a little bit by showing  some examples and elaborate on the technical specifications of various syndication  formats appropriate for multimedia feeds. In this appendix, we will have a closer  look at the specifications of:   	 RSS 2.0  	 Atom  	 The MediaRSS syndication format extension  RSS A very common format for syndication is RSS, which is a dialect of XML. All RSS  feeds must conform to the XML 1.0 specification, as published on the World Wide  Web Consortium  W3C  website. As we already saw in Chapter 7 the meaning of  the RSS abbreviation varies with each version of RSS:   	 Rich Site Summary  RSS versions 0.9x   	 RDF Site Summary  RSS versions 0.9 and 1.0   	 Really Simple Syndication in RSS 2.0   Syndication Formats  Here is a more detailed table on the individual versions and revisions:  Version 0.90  Owner Netscape  0.91  UserLand  Pros  Drop-dead  simple  0.92,  0.93, 0.94  UserLand  1.0  RSS-DEV  Working Group  2.0  UserLand  Allow richer  metadata than  0.91 RDF-based,  extensibility via  modules, and  not controlled  by a single  vendor Extensibility  via modules,  easy migration  path from 0.9x  branch  Status Obsoleted by  1.0 Officially  obsoleted by  2.0, but still  quite popular  Obsoleted by  2.0  Stable  core, active  module  development  Recommendation Don't use  Use for basic  syndication; easy  migration path  to 2.0 if you need  more flexibility Use 2.0 instead  Use for RDF-based  applications or if  you need advanced  RDF-specific  modules  Stable  core, active  module  development  Use for general  purpose,   metadata-rich  syndication  Meanwhile, the RSS 2.0 specs were released through Harvard under a Creative  Commons License. The full specifications can be found on the Harvard website:  http:  cyber.law.harvard.edu rss rss.html. Here are some excerpts.  RSS 2.0 specification An RSS 2.0 document is composed of XML elements containing the relevant feed  information. It has three required elements and a number of optional elements.   [ 318 ]   Required channel elements  Here's a list of the required channel elements, each with a brief description and   an example:  Element title  Example GoUpstate.com News Headlines  Appendix B  link  description  Element language  copyright  Optional channel elements  Here's a list of optional channel elements:  http:  www.goupstate.com   The latest news from   GoUpstate.com, a Spartanburg  Herald-Journal website  Example en-us  Copyright 2002, Spartanburg   Herald-Journal  managingEditor  geo@herald.com  George Matesky   webMaster  betty@herald.com  Betty Guernsey   Description The name of the channel.  It's how people refer to  your service. If you have an  HTML website that contains  the same information as  your RSS file, the title of  your channel should be the  same as the title of your  website. The URL to the HTML  website corresponding to  the channel. A phrase or a sentence  describing the channel.  Description The language the  channel is written in. Copyright notice  for content in the  channel. E-mail address of the  person responsible  for editorial content. E-mail address of the  person responsible  for technical issues  relating to channel.  [ 319 ]   Syndication Formats  Element pubDate  Example Sat, 07 Sep 2002 00:00:01 GMT  Description The publication date  for the content in  the channel. All date  times in RSS conform  to the Date and  Time Specification  of RFC 822, with  the exception that  the year may be  expressed with two  characters or four  characters  four  preferred . The date of the last  time the content  of the channel was  changed. Specify one or more  categories that the  channel belongs to. A string indicating  the program used to  generate the channel. A URL that points to  the documentation  for the format used in  the RSS file. Allows processes  to register with  a cloud to be  notified of updates  to the channel,  implementing a  lightweight publish- subscribe protocol for  RSS feeds. The number of  minutes that indicates  how long a channel  can be cached before  refreshing from the  source.

Subelement of channel—image   is an optional subelement of  , which contains three required  and three optional subelements.   The required elements are:   	   is the URL of a GIF, JPEG, or PNG image that represents the channel.  	   describes the image. It's used in the ALT attribute of the HTML     tag when the channel is rendered in HTML.   	   is the URL of the site. When the channel is rendered, the image   is a link to the site.  Note that in practice, the   and   of images should  have the same value as the channel's   and  .  The optional elements are:   	   is the width of the image in pixels. The maximum value for   width is 144 and the default value is 88   	   is the height of the image in pixels. The maximum value for   height is 400 and the default value is 31   	   contains text that is included in the title attribute of   the link formed around the image in the HTML rendering  [ 321 ]   Syndication Formats Elements of    A channel may contain any number of item tags. An item may represent a "story"  much like a story in a newspaper or magazine. If so, its description is a synopsis of  the story, and the link points to the full story. An item may also be complete in itself.  If so, the description contains the text  entity-encoded HTML is allowed , and the  link and the title may be omitted. All elements of an item are optional. However,  either the title or the description must be present.  Element title link  Example  Description The title of the item Venice Film Festival Tries to Quit Sinking The URL of the  item  description The item synopsis  http:  nytimes.com 2004 12   07FEST.html Some of the most heated chatter at the Venice  Film Festival this week was about the way that  the arrival of the stars at the Palazzo del Cinema  was being staged oprah@oxygen.net  author  category  comments  enclosure  guid  pubDate  source  E-mail address of  the author of the  item Includes the item  in one or more  categories URL of a page for  comments relating  to the item Describes a media  object that is  attached to the item A string that  uniquely identifies  the item Indicates when the  item was published The RSS channel  that the item came  from  http:  www.myblog.org cgi-local mt  mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=290  93456a40a6a945502893935f28d35606  Sun, 19 May 2002 15:21:36 GMT  [ 322 ]   Appendix B  Subelement of item—enclosure   is an optional subelement of  .  It has three required attributes:   	 url says where the enclosure is located. The URL must be an HTTP URL.   	 length says how big it is in bytes.  	 type says what its type is—a standard MIME type.   <enclosure url="http:  www.scripting.com mp3s                   weatherReportSuite.mp3" length="12216320"                   type="audio mpeg"  >  Subelement of item—guid   is an optional subelement of  . GUID stands for Globally Unique Identifier. It's a string that uniquely identifies the  item. When present, an aggregator may choose to use this string to determine if an  item is new.    93456a40a6a945502893935f28d35606   For Archetype content in Plone, this can be the UID.  There are no rules for the syntax of a guid. Aggregators must view them as a string.  It's up to the source of the feed to establish the uniqueness of the string. If the guid element has an attribute named isPermaLink with a value of true,  the reader may assume that it is a permalink to the item, that is, a URL that can  be opened in a web browser that points to the full item described by the    element. An example is:   http:  inessential.com 2002 09 01.phpa2     isPermaLink is optional, and its default value is true. If its value is false, the guid  may not be assumed to be a URL, or a URL to anything in particular.

The items  that a feed is composed of are known as  entries. Each entry is attached with an extensible set of metadata. For example, each  entry has a required title. The full specification is available as RFC 4287.  The primary use case that Atom addresses is the syndication of web content to other  websites as well as directly to web users.  The XML namespace URI [W3C.REC-xml-names-19990114] for the XML data  format described in this specification is http:  www.w3.org 2005 Atom.  For convenience, this data format may be referred to as "Atom 1.0". This specification  uses "Atom" internally.  Constructing Atom documents Atom documents conform to the XML standard. As in RSS 2.0, there are a number of  predefined elements that can be used for composing a feed document. Unlike RSS,  Atom has an attribute to specify the type of content, which makes it easy for client  software to interpret and display the element contents.  This generic approach allows the inclusion of any RSS extension  for example,  MediaRSS or geoRSS .  The type attribute Text constructs have an optional type attribute. If it is present, the value must be one  of text, html, or xhtml. The default value for the type attribute is text.  Here's an example atom:title with text content:      Less: &lt;    If the value is text, the content of the Text construct is not allowed to contain child  elements. The intention of such a text is to present it to humans in a readable fashion.  Here's an example atom:title with HTML content:      Less: &lt;em> &amp;lt; &lt; em>    [ 325 ]   Syndication Formats  If the value of type is html, the content of the Text construct must not contain child  elements and should be suitable for handling as HTML. Any markup within must be  escaped, for example,   as &lt;br&gt;. Here's an example atom:title with XHTML content:            Less:   &lt;          If the value of type is xhtml, the content of the Text construct must be a  single XHTML div element and should be suitable for handling as XHTML.  The XHTML div element itself is not part of the content.   Persons A Person construct is an element that describes a natural person, a corporation, or  a similar entity. Person constructs have one required element, atom:name, and two  optional elements—atom:uri and atom:email. If a uri or an email is specified, it  has to be unique.       John Doe     http:  www.example.com persons john.doe     johndoe@example.com         Dates Date constructs in an Atom feed conform to the date time format defined in RFC  3339. In addition, an uppercase T character must be used to separate date and  time, and an uppercase Z character must be present in the absence of a numeric  time zone offset.   2003-12-13T18:30:02Z   2003-12-13T18:30:02+01:00   2003-12-13T18:30:02.25+01:00   [ 326 ]   An Atom example An example Atom feed looks like this:  Appendix B         dive into mark     A &lt;em&gt;lot&lt; em&gt;                           of effort went into making this                           effortless         2005-07-31T12:29:29Z          tag:example.org,2003:3    <link rel="alternate" type="text html" hreflang="en"          href="http:  example.org " >   <link rel="self" type="application Atom+xml"          href="http:  example.org feed.Atom" >    Copyright  c  2003, Mark Pilgrim                 Example Toolkit              Atom draft-07 snapshot      <link rel="alternate" type="text html"            href="http:  example.org 2005 04 02 Atom" >     <link rel="enclosure" type="audio mpeg" length="1337"            href="http:  example.org audio ph34r_my_podcast.mp3"  >            tag:example.org,2003:3.2397            2005-07-31T12:29:29Z             2003-12-13T08:29:29-04:00                            Mark Pilgrim                http:  example.org                   f8dy@example.com                                      Sam Ruby                                      Joe Gregorio                      <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en"               xml:base="http:  diveintomark.org ">                             [Update: The Atom draft is finished.]                                        [ 327 ]   Syndication Formats  MediaRSS The MediaRSS format is not a standalone format like RSS or Atom, but an extension  to RSS 2.0. It is aimed at enhancing the enclosure capabilities already present in RSS  2.0. As said before, it is possible to use the extension with Atom too. Additionally,  to the syndication of audio files and images, MediaRSS can handle other enclosure  types like short films or TV and also provides additional metadata with the media.  The namespace for MediaRSS is defined to be http:  search.yahoo.com mrss .  The trailing slash of the namespace URL is important!  Primary elements The MediaRSS format comes with two base elements—media:group and  media:content. These two elements are used for primary multimedia  enclosure  media:content  and to structure these enclosures  media:group .      is a subelement of  . It allows grouping of the    elements that are effectively the same content, yet different  representations. For instance, the same song recorded in both the WAV and MP3  formats. It's an optional element that must only be used for this purpose.      is a subelement of either   or  . Media objects  that are not the same content should not be included in the same    element. The sequence of these items implies the order of presentation. While many  of the attributes appear to be audio video specific, this element can be used to  publish any type of media. It contains 14 attributes, most of which are optional.  <media:content    url="http:  www.foo.com movie.mov"    fileSize="12216320"    type="video quicktime"   medium="video"   isDefault="true"    expression="full"    bitrate="128"    framerate="25"   samplingrate="44.1"  [ 328 ]   Appendix B  Example http:  www.foo.com  movie.mov  12216320  video quicktime    channels="2"   duration="185"    height="200"   width="300"    lang="en"  >  Element url  fileSize  type  medium  isDefault  expression  bitrate  framerate  samplingrate  channels  Description The direct URL to the media object.

When an element appears at a shallow level, such as   or  , it means  that the element should be applied to every media object within its scope.  Duplicated elements appearing at deeper levels of the document tree have higher  priority over other levels. For example, the   level elements are  favored over the   level elements. The priority level is listed from strongest  to weakest:  ,  ,  , and  .    This allows the permissible audience to be declared. If this element is not included,  it assumes that no restrictions are necessary.

All HTML must be entity encoded. It is  an optional attribute.      allows particular images to be used as representative images  for the media object. If multiple thumbnails are included and time coding is not in  play, it is assumed that the images are in the order of importance.  <media:thumbnail url="http:  www.foo.com keyframe.jpg" width="75"                    height="50" time="12:05:01.123"  >  It has one required attribute and three optional attributes:   	 url specifies the URL of the thumbnail.

[ 334 ]   Links and Further Information  The very last part of the book is reserved for some hints about where and how to find  further information on Plone and multimedia topics. There are some pointers in the  text already. Here we will collect them and comment on them a little bit. Multimedia  and Plone is a broad field, and techniques and resources are constantly changing.  Here we will see some entry points on how to help ourselves when working on the  subject. The topics we will cover are:   	 How to use different sources such as search engines, the Web, e-mail, and   chat to find Plone-specific help   	 How and where to find Plone add-ons  	 Some further links to selected multimedia topics  Getting Plone help Plone has a strong, vibrant, and active community. There are many options to get  help if you are stuck in the middle of something. Let's see what you can do:   	 Documentation on plone.org  	 Google and blogs  	 Mailing lists   forums IRC  online support   	  	 Commercial support   Links and Further Information  Documentation on plone.org The documentation on the plone.org website is probably the number one place to  start if looking for Plone-related help. The site itself is Plone driven and comes with  the familiar fulltext search.  There is a special documentation section where you can find categories for all kinds  of Plone-related topics. These include:   	 Basic use  	 Configuration and setup  	 Managing content  	 Users, authentication, and permissions  	 Upgrading, moving, and so on  Each document entry has information attached about which Plone version it is  applicable to and what is the targeted audience: end users, site administrators,   or developers.   Google and blogs Not all documentation is hosted on plone.org itself. A good deal of it is widespread  over different blogs, private websites, and various other web resources. Search  engines such as Google are a big help here. There is a news collector at www.planet.plone.org. Everyone who is running a  Plone-centric blog may register there. You can subscribe to the provided RSS  syndication feed as a whole or to the RSS feed of individual participants.  Mailing lists forums The Plone community maintains a couple of mailing lists for the discussion of  relevant topics. These mailing lists are mirrored as forums on http:  plone.org  support forums. All the entries can be read there.  There are several ways to post to these lists forums. One option is to have a Nabble  account  http:  www.nabble.com  . Another option is to subscribe to the mailing  lists through Gmane  http:  gmane.org   with your favorite mail client.  [ 336 ]   Appendix C  The most important lists are probably:   	 Plone User: A list of questions for people using the Plone CMS. This list is    the most active one and it is OK for a newbie to ask questions there.   	 Plone Developers: The list for Plone core developers. On this list, possible   new features and problems with current ones in the Plone core are discussed.  It is for the core developers only.   	 Plone Product Developers: The list for add-on products. Questions and topics   related to third-party products and extensions are discussed on this list.  Always remember to check the documentation on plone.org and  other resources before asking any questions. Try to include as much  information as possible  Plone version, operating system, installed  products, and error traceback . Most of the communication rules  listed in the online support part apply here too.  Plone4Artists used to have its own website, but it seems to be gone. It still has its  own mailing list, which is hosted on Google groups: http:  groups.google.com  group p4a-user.  IRC  Online support  To get real-time support, it is possible to use an IRC  Internet Relay Chat . On irc. freenode.net, there is a dedicated Plone channel: plone. It can be accessed directly  through the Web or with a dedicated chat client. Information on working chat clients  can be found at http:  plone.org support chat.  The chat is a volunteer service. There is no guarantee that your question will   be answered. Here are some tips from plone.org to enhance your chance of  getting help:   	 Don't ask if you can ask a question—just ask it.  	 Tell what you're trying to achieve, what you're doing, and what's    not working.   	 Being polite is the best way to get the help you need.  	 Do your research before you ask questions. Use other means of getting    help before asking.  [ 337 ]   Links and Further Information   	 The level of activity varies, so if you don't get help at once, stay online for  a while.  Most chat participants are on North Central South America or  European time, and tend to be most active during normal business hours.   People will answer if they know, or ask for more details if they need it.  Repeating the same question again and again won't help.   	 Don't send private messages to people unless they have asked you to.  	 Don't paste code into the chat room—use a paster service     such as pastie.org  and paste the URL of the result to the channel instead.  Commercial support Another option is to enlist a professional consultant. On plone.net, there is list of  Plone providers for several countries. This list includes hosting, development, and  other consultant service providers.  Finding Plone add-ons In many parts of the book, we saw the power of Plone out of the box. It comes with  a sophisticated way of managing web content related to multimedia or not. Even  with this "vanilla power", it is built to be extensible and some really nice features   are provided by third-party products.  There is an enormous number of these products around and sometimes it feels like  looking for a needle in a haystack to find the right product for the right use case. The  following sections will give you some hints and guidelines for crawling through the  haystack.  If you are looking for products to match your specific use case, you have basically  three entry points:   	 PyPi: The Python package index  	 Plone products: A part of plone.org dedicated to third-party products   for Plone   	 Collective: A Subversion repository open for the versioning of third-party   products used with Plone in a broader sense  [ 338 ]   Appendix C  The PyPi Python egg index Probably the most important source for Python products in general is the PYthon  Package Index. Since Zope 2.10, it has been possible  without any additional effort   to include Python packages found in the Python search path directly as Zope   products. Since then, the number of Python packages targeted at Zope and especially  Plone has exploded.  Most of the publicly available packages commonly known as eggs are hosted on   PyPi. Each package has its own page with a description and the egg itself as a   binary bundle, as a source package, or both.  To find out if an egg is suitable for Plone, you may first look at the namespace.  Candidates for Plone add-ons are packages with the following namespaces: plone.*,  collective.*, archetypes.*, p4a.*, plonetheme.*, and Products.*. Some Plone  consulting companies use their own company name as namespace. If you know a  company that not only works with Plone but also uses it, if you find a package with  the company name as package namespace, the package is usually a Plone product.  Another indicator for Plone products is the category. Python eggs are categorized.  The setup method in the setup.py of a Python egg takes the classifiers  parameter. It takes a list of possible categories. The Framework :: Plone category  indicates that a package is targeted for use with Plone. Unfortunately, the use of  these categories is not authoritative and it is up to the package maintainer to specify  the right categories, if any.  The updates on PyPi are available as an RSS feed, but be warned that it is very noisy.  Plone products on plone.org Another important source for Plone products is, of course, the plone.org website  itself . The products section provides a form for searching products compatible  with your version of Plone. Unfortunately, the products and their releases and  descriptions are not always up to date. It is still a good idea to check both sources   if the product is available as an egg. For old-style products that are not available as eggs, plone.org is the main source  of research.  [ 339 ]   Links and Further Information  The Plone Collective Finally, there is the Subversion repository of Plone and the collective. If you use  products from there you have to know what you are doing. Sometimes it is necessary  to use the development sources from the trunk if you want a bleeding-edge feature  or if there is no release of a package available. There are three separate repositories  used for Plone products:  1.  Plone  http:  svn.plone.org svn plone  : This repository is reserved   for the Plone core. The repository is world readable, but you have to sign the  contributor agreement to write to it.  2.  Archetypes  http:  svn.plone.org svn archetypes  : This repository   is designated for the Archetypes framework and its extensions. You find  additional fields and widgets there. The repository is world readable. To  write to it, you need a plone.org account and you need to file a ticket in the  plone.org bug tracker.  3.  Collective  http:  svn.plone.org svn collective  : The Collective   repository is a loose collection of products associated with Plone in a broader  sense. Besides feature add-ons, you find themes there and buildout recipies  not necessarily tied to Plone. The repository is world readable. The procedure  for getting write access is the same as for the Archetypes repository.  Links for selected multimedia topics In the final section, there are some suggestions on where to start if looking   for help on selected multimedia topics. A general good starting point, besides   fulltext searches on Google, is Wikipedia for getting detailed information and   further links on multimedia formats and other topics.  Image links Images are usually acquired from another web resource, a digital camera, or a  scanner. Depending on your hardware setup, your operating system, and the image  manipulation program the techniques you use for preparing images for the Web  might differ. "Prepare images web gimp" or "prepare images web Photoshop" are  valuable queries on Google for this purpose.   [ 340 ]   Appendix C  Audio links A good tool for manipulating audio available on all major platforms is Audacity. On  the home page  http:  audacity.sourceforge.net  , there are some general tips  on processing digital audio. Processing audio files is called mastering, which might  be a good keyword to include if searching for help.  Video encoding and conversion resources A good starting point for getting help if working with videos is the home page of  Flowplayer  http:  flowplayer.org tutorials index.html . There are some  tutorials on encoding videos for use with the Web. Another good source, which does  not provide much information on its own but collects valuable resources from all  over the Web, is www.videohelp.com. It contains links to video players, encoders,  and other software and hardware tools. And it lists tutorials and How-Tos on  encoding, capturing, and processing videos.  Flash and Silverlight Both Flash and Silverlight are commercial solutions, and provide a good amount of  documentation on their websites. Besides general documentation, there are tutorials  and forums for both solutions. The Linux-specific part of Silverlight  Moonlight  can  be found at http:  www.go-mono.com moonlight .  The API and some examples for creating Flash applets from scratch can be found on  the pyswftools home page: http:  pyswftools.sourceforge.net .
