I was speaking at a PhoneGap Day  conference in Portland, Oregon, and I looked over to see Brian LeRoux speaking with someone I  didn’t recognize. I leaned over and asked a friend, “Hey, who’s the guy in the suit?,” to which the  friend responded, “Oh, that’s John Wargo. He’s an analyst.” The suit set John apart at this nerd  gathering, as most of the attendees were wearing t-shirts with funny slogans. This was before the  time when Mark Zuckerberg popularized the “coder wearing a hoodie” look.  If I remember correctly, my t-shirt had a pig on it with a speech bubble that said, “Mmmm . . .  bacon,” and as I reflect back on that time, it wasn’t even a suit John was wearing—it was just a  blazer. However, it’s not an exaggeration to say he was the best-dressed man at the conference, but  I digress.  “Oh boy!” I thought, “An analyst.” You see, I had just recently transitioned from the telecom  industry to full-on software development. In telecom, analysts do not have the greatest of  reputations. Then I talked to John. He proceeded to ask me insightful questions about my work  on PhoneGap and in the Apache Cordova community.  Folks, at this point, I’m resisting the urge to insert a don’t judge a book by its cover joke, and I’ve  never been good at not making a bad joke.  John went on to become an important member and educator of the Apache Cordova community  and to write not one, but four authoritative books on the subject, not unlike the one you hold in  your hands now on Progressive Web Apps.  One of the oft-cited tenets of the PhoneGap Cordova project was to ultimately “cease to exist,”  but the other less-mentioned tenet was to “make the web a first-class development platform.”  Now that promise of being a first-class platform has been fulfilled by Progressive Web Apps. Being  a major part of the Apache Cordova community for so long puts John in a great position, as he  has been there every step of the way to see the evolution of the mobile web.  Should you happen to bump into John at a conference or at a book-signing someday, come  prepared with a recommendation on where to get a fresh, delicious doughnut. This is one of the  two traits we share in common. The other being a dry, sardonic wit.  You have made an excellent decision in picking up this book. If I were just starting on my learning  path to mastery of Progressive Web Apps, there are not many folks I would trust more than John  to get me there. I only wish that you could hear John’s voice while you are reading this book like  I did.  —Simon MacDonald, Developer Advocate, Adobe November 2019   Preface When building apps targeting desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablets, developers have  generally two options to use: native apps built specifically for the target platform or web apps that  ultimately can run on most any system due to the abstraction layer provided by web browsers.  Building native apps for any target platform is a time-consuming and expensive proposition,  especially when your app targets multiple types of systems  desktop computers, smartphones,  televisions, etc. .  Web apps were challenging because a user’s experience could vary dramatically depending on  which type of system the user accessed the app from. Desktop browsers are fully capable, but  mobile device browsers have limitations due to reduced screen real estate, processor speed,  network bandwidth, and more. Many of these limitations have disappeared, but there’s still  considerable disparity between native app and web app capabilities.  Web developers have a lot of tools and technologies at their disposal to help them build rich,  engaging apps. Over the years, different technologies such as Sun Microsystems’ Java1 and Adobe  Flash2 appeared with the expectation that they’d change the world for web apps—delivering a  more engaging experiences for users. Both did that but ultimately disappeared from the browser  for good reason.  What developers and users need is a way to enable web apps to work more like native apps. If  we had that, our web apps would soar and enable us to more easily deliver cross-platform apps  through the browser rather than handcrafting native apps for each supported platform.  Over the years, web browsers, especially those running on mobile devices such as smartphones  and tablets, started exposing more native capabilities to web apps. For example, modern web apps  can access the device’s file system and let a browser-based app know the device’s geolocation. This  enables web apps to work more like native apps, but there were still limitations. Service workers  are a relatively new technology that makes it easier for web apps to bridge the gap between native  and web capabilities, removing many limitations from web apps.  This is a book about service workers.  Yes, I know, the title says the book is about Progressive Web Apps  PWAs , and it is, but the book  focuses on how to use service workers to enhance the capabilities of a web app and create PWAs.  There are several books out there that focus on the engagement impact of PWAs; how to build  PWAs that delight and inspire users to do more in the app. This isn’t that kind of book.  This book is focused as much as possible on the technologies enabling PWAs and how to use them  to enhance your web apps to deliver a more native-like experience in your web apps.  I come to you with 15 years of experience with mobile development  I wrote the first book on  BlackBerry development so many years ago , and, as Simon said in the Foreword, PWAs are the   1.  https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Java_ software_platform  2.  https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Adobe_Flash   Preface  xiii  next step in making the web a first-class development platform—especially for mobile apps. My  interest in writing this book focuses on PWAs’ impact on mobile developers, but everything here  applies to web apps running on a desktop browser as well.  If you’ve read any of my books, you already know that this manuscript contains no phrases or  content in any language but English  I refuse to make you put down the book to go look up some  obscure phrase in Latin or French to understand a point . This book also contains no pop culture  references  well, except for one that I describe completely so you won’t feel left out if you don’t  already know it .  Unlike my previous technical books, which were focused on the technologies and how to use  them  with lots of code examples , this book is project- based. As you work through the chapters,  at different points you’ll start with one of three complete, standalone web apps, then convert  them into PWAs using service workers and other technologies.  The sample apps for this book were written specifically to be simple and easy to understand, so  they’re not fancy. I could have built them as amazing, reactive, modern web apps, leveraging  JavaScript frameworks such as VueJS3 or React,4 but instead I built them using plain, vanilla  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This approach removes a lot of extraneous code from the apps and  leaves just what you need to understand the topic at hand.  You can find all of the source code for the sample apps on GitHub at https:  github.com  johnwargo learning-pwa-code. To make it easier for readers consuming the printed version of  this book, I added a resources.md5 file to the source code folder for each chapter; it lists all of  the links used in the chapter. Rather than typing in long URLs from the chapter content, you can  simply open the resources file in a browser and quickly access any link from the chapter.  Unlike the source code repositories for other books, the book’s source code doesn’t contain only  before and after versions of the apps. Instead, as you complete a chapter section, you’ll find the  source code modifications for just that section in a separate file. This enables you to more easily  build the app along with the chapter content while having just that section’s code available  in case you have an issue and want to compare the completed code with yours. This approach  should streamline your following along, especially if you create typos or bugs as you work.  If you have any questions or comments about the book or if you find an error in the text or  code, please submit them through the issues area in the book’s GitHub repository at https:   github.com johnwargo learning-pwa-code issues. The code there is open source, so feel free to  use it in your applications  it would be especially nice if you referenced the source for the code so  others can learn about this book .  If you find a bug in the code and want to fix it yourself, do so, then submit a pull request against  the repository, and I’ll take a look. I’m usually very good about responding, so you should hear  back from me in a day or so. Please be nice—GitHub is a very public forum, and we should all  treat people there as we expect to be treated by others.  3.  https:  vuejs.org  4.  https:  reactjs.org  5.  https:  github.com johnwargo learning-pwa-code blob master chapter-01 resources.md   xiv  Preface  I created a public web site for the book at https:  learningpwa.com. I’ll publish errata and,  hopefully, related content there over time. Forestalling any complaints, as I write this, the site  isn’t a PWA. It isn’t a PWA because it doesn’t need to be a PWA. It’s just a marketing landing page  for the book, and there are no browser notifications I want to send to visitors, nor is there a need  to cache the site’s content for increased performance or offline use. Just because I can make the  site into a PWA doesn’t mean that I should. Use the power of PWAs only for those sites that really  need them.  Two of the three sample apps from the book are published online as well. The first is the Tip  Calculator from Chapter 2, which you can access at https:  learningpwa.com tipcalc . The other  is the PWA News site from Chapters 3, 4, and 5—you can find that app at https:  pwa-news.com.  The Learning Progressive Web Apps site is a static site hosted at Netlify,6 so that one will probably  stay active as long as the book is publicly available. The PWA News site requires computing  resources  its server-side is a node.js7 application , so I’ll leave the site up as long as there is  interest in the book. Eventually, I’ll shut it down, but the full source for the server is included  with the book’s source code, so you’ll always be able to run a local copy of the server or host the  site somewhere else yourself.  That’s it! This preface contains everything I wanted to tell you about the book. I believe in PWAs  and think they are the future of mobile app development, so that’s why I worked to put this book  into your hands. I really enjoyed writing it, and I hope you enjoy reading it as much or more.

Thank you, Greg Doench at  Pearson, for having the faith in me to publish this book  this is our sixth book together . I’m an  experienced software developer, but I suck at making apps beautiful, so the only reason you have  cool-looking sample apps to work with herein is due to the styling magic of my friend Scott Good.  Thank you, Simon MacDonald, for your kind words in the Foreword and for sharing the same  love for doughnuts that I have. It’s so cool to know that when I speak at a developer conference  somewhere, Simon will be there to lead me to another cool doughnut shop.  Thank you, Maxim Salnikov, for providing feedback on the first draft of the manuscript and  connecting me to the PWA community.  Thanks to Jeff Burtoft, David Rousset, and Justin Willis from the PWABuilder team for bringing  me up to speed on PWABuilder and helping me with the content for Chapter 8.  This book absolutely wouldn’t exist except for the hard work from the Pearson production team  to bring it to print. Thanks to Julie Nahil, Carol Lallier, Vaishnavi Venkatesan, and others at  Pearson working diligently behind the scenes to finish the manuscript and take it to print.  Finally, I would never be able to even write a sentence of this book without the full support of my  wife Anna. I spend a lot of time in my office tinkering, writing apps, and learning new technologies  for fun, profit, and career growth. Whenever I start a book project  this is my seventh, the eighth  if you count the collection of magazine articles I wrote that ultimately became a book , I make  sure she understands how the effort is going to consume a lot of my time. She always laughs and  reminds me that a book project isn’t any different in her eyes, as it’s just a bunch of time I spend  toiling away in my office while she hangs out with the kids and the dogs. I do get away without  doing many dishes while working on a book, but I try to make up for that later.   About the Author John M.

He lives in Charlotte, North Carolina, with his wife Anna, 16-year-old twins, and two dogs.   1 Introducing  Progressive Web Apps  A Progressive Web App  PWA  is a web app that leverages special browser capabilities that enable  the app to act more like a native or mobile app when running on capable browsers. That’s it,  that’s all that needs to be said—the rest of this book is all about showing you how to build them   with lots of code examples, of course .  Developers build PWAs primarily using two technologies available in most modern browsers: web  app manifest files and service workers. Chapter 2, “Web App Manifest Files,” tells you pretty much  everything you need to know about web app manifest files. The remaining chapters cover service  workers and what you can do with them.  There’s no standard or standards body for PWAs; a PWA is just a web app built to act a certain  way. Use as much or as little PWA functionality as you want in your web apps. You can have  web apps that use some PWA capabilities but aren’t PWAs and PWAs that use only some PWA  capabilities.  PWA has its own community-driven logo, shown in Figure 1.1. You can even create your own  version of the logo, specifying any color for the W portion using the tool at https:  diekus.net  logo-pwinter.  Figure 1.1  The Community-Driven PWA Logo  Unfortunately, there are different views of what PWAs are; let me fill you in on my view. . .    18  Chapter 1  Introducing Progressive Web Apps   First, a Little Bit of History Google and other browser vendors add special features to their browsers all the time, striving to  provide more tools developers can use to enhance the web. In 2015, a designer named Frances  Berriman and a Google Chrome engineer named Alex Russell coined the term Progressive Web  Apps to describe, according to Wikipedia, “apps taking advantage of new features supported by  modern browsers, including service workers and web app manifests, that let users upgrade web  apps to progressive web apps in their native operating system  OS .”  Google Chrome was the leading browser at the time that supported the required technologies, so  Google started heavily promoting this new approach to building web apps.  PWAs Are . . . Google’s Progressive Web Apps landing page1 says that PWAs are    Reliable   Fast   Engaging  These terms describe a user’s perception of an app, not anything about how the app is built, what  technologies it uses, or what it can do. The technologies used to build PWAs enable developers  to build web apps that are reliable, fast, and engaging, but only if web developers have the skills  and take the time to do it. I think Google’s description is off base, since there are a lot of inexperi- enced web developers out there who can build PWAs that aren’t reliable, fast, or engaging, but the  apps are still PWAs.  So, with that in mind, in this book, PWAs are about the technologies used and how to make  them. There are a lot of online articles and books available about how PWAs are more engaging  and the impact they’ve had on businesses’ success or revenue; the best place to start for that  information is on PWA Stats.2  I align with Jeremy Keith’s definition from What Is a Progressive Web App?3 Here’s my take: PWAs  are web apps with a little bit of special magic that enable them to act more like mobile apps. It’s  the concept of web apps working more like mobile apps that makes PWAs so interesting.  If you think about most native mobile apps you use on your phone, they   Are installable from the phone platform’s public app store  and enterprise stores for   employee apps , putting an app icon on the device’s home screen.   Will load and operate  although in a potentially limited fashion  regardless of whether the  device has network connectivity. The app’s UI is embedded in the application binary and  loads locally when you open the app  pulling data from the network when it can .  1.  https:  developers.google.com web progressive-web-apps  2.  https:  www.pwastats.com  3.  https:  adactio.com journal 13098   PWAs Are . . .  19   Can run in the background, even doing things or processing data while you’re doing   something else on the device.   Can receive push notifications  messages sent to the device or an app from an external   system .   With some extra work, can even deliver a rich and robust offline experience, caching new   records for upload later and synchronizing data with a server-based app.  Does that describe many of the mobile apps you use today? Does your email  or fill in another app  name here  app work regardless of whether the device has network connectivity? If you turn off  the radio and open the app, does the app’s UI open and display much of the data that was there  earlier? When you send a message while offline, does the app queue the data for transmission  later? Does the app receive notifications  like when new mail is available ? Yeah, I thought so;  those are core capabilities of modern mobile apps.  Turning to PWAs:   PWAs are installable: mobile and desktop users can quickly install them on their phone’s  home screen or desktop using an installation UI provided in the app. Mobile phones have  pretty much always had the ability to copy a web site’s URL to the device’s home screen, but  installing the app is better. I explain more about it in Chapter 2.   PWAs cache the app’s core UI on the local device, so when the user opens the app, the  UI loads quickly before the app tries to go out and get updated data from the network.  Consequently, PWAs feel snappier than traditional web apps.   PWAs run background tasks, enabling resource caching and background processing.   Traditional web apps can’t do this  well, they can, but it takes a lot of handcrafted code or a  third-party library .   PWAs can receive push notifications from a backend server regardless of whether the app is   running.  When Apple announced the iPhone, they famously failed when they assumed developers would  be happy having the ability to build web apps only for the platform. Steve Jobs and company arro- gantly assumed the browser was enough and could accommodate most app needs. The developer  community quickly rebelled, forced Apple’s hand, and that’s how we got the ability to code native  apps on iOS.  They rebelled because even though the Safari was quite capable on iOS, and Apple provided some  great developer tools  no, not Xcode, anyone remember Dashcode?4 , there were things that app  developers just couldn’t do in the browser. These limitations were also the motivation for the  PhoneGap project  which later became Apache Cordova ; the project started specifically to enable  cross-platform mobile development and give browser developers access to device capabilities that  weren’t, at the time, available in the native browser.  Over the years, many of those capabilities made it into the browser through open standards cover- ing things like the device accelerometer, camera, compass, microphone, and much more. Browser  apps became more capable, but the few final requirements giving the browser equal footing   4.  https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Dashcode   20  Chapter 1  Introducing Progressive Web Apps   with native mobile apps were—and this should sound familiar—the capabilities to install a web  app on a device, cache code and content locally, run background tasks  even when the app isn’t  running , and receive push notifications. The technologies enabling PWAs deliver those final  required capabilities to the browser; and, with these capabilities in place, a web app can now act  more like a native app.  Making a Progressive Web App Several technologies enable PWAs; without them, a web app simply can’t be a PWA. Those  technologies are web app manifest files, service workers, and Hypertext Transfer Protocol  Secure  HTTPS  or, more accurately, HTTP over Transport Layer Security  TLS . HTTPS enables  secure communication between a client and server and isn’t a topic I cover in this book except  to describe later that it’s required for most PWA capabilities and I explain why. The following  chapters describe in detail how to use web app manifest files and service workers to build a PWA.  For now, it’s good to know that web app manifest files enable installation of a web app on the  local system running the app, and service workers make everything else PWAs do possible.  Table 1.1 lists the app capabilities from the previous section mapped against the PWA  technologies that enable them.  Table 1.1  PWA Capabilities by Implementation Technology  Capability  Install shortcut  Cache content  Background processing  Push notifications  Yes  No  No  No  Yes  Yes  Yes  Web Manifest  Service Workers  TLS  HTTPS   Required, but not involved  Yes  Yes  No  Yes  A developer must do a lot of work to make a web site interesting, engaging, and useful. This  means crafting the site’s pages so they look good and work well on screens or browser windows  of varying dimensions  width and height . Web developers must take the client-side browser’s  capabilities into account when building these sites, and many developers deliver different  capabilities in their sites based on what does or doesn’t work in the browser used at runtime.  Some mobile browsers  like the ones on feature phones  can’t process a lot of client-side code, so  JavaScript may be disabled or have limited capabilities on that device.  The process developers use to build web pages for these scenarios is called progressive enhancement,  where the developer focuses on the content first, then layers on additional functionality for  more capable browsers. This means that the app simply works, displaying the required content,  regardless of whether the browser supports the extra bells and whistles  like fancy CSS transforms   the developer added for more robust browsers. If those capabilities are there, then the user gets  the full experience. If they’re not, the user can at least view the content.  Web apps are more interactive, like Wikipedia  web site  vs. Gmail  web app . Web apps use  client-side scripting languages such as JavaScript  or its sister language TypeScript  to deliver    Making a Progressive Web App  21  a more dynamic and exciting client-side experience. With a web app, when you first hit the  app’s URL, the app’s shell downloads and renders before the app goes out to the server for the  app’s data.  You can see an example of this in Figure 1.2. The app shell consists of the side navigation and the  top button bar, while the content in the content area  bound within the orange border  changes  dynamically based on the choices the user makes in the app.  Figure 1.2  Web App Shell Structure  PWAs progressively enhance web apps—that’s, um, why they’re called Progressive Web Apps.  So, let’s assume we have a dynamic web app that’s all about user interaction and dynamic data.  The app requires a more capable browser and certainly means that there’s JavaScript involved   to deliver the dynamic nature of the app . The app runs in the browser and uses the system’s  network connection to download the shell, then, or perhaps in parallel, it retrieves the app’s data  from a server. When the browser running the app doesn’t have network connectivity, the browser  displays a spinner or an error message, and the user simply can’t use the app.  True to PWA’s progressive moniker, you’ll enhance the app when you add a web manifest file  to enable client-side installation and add a service worker to enable caching, background pro- cessing, and support for push notifications. On browsers that support those capabilities, the  PWA becomes installable and lets the user run the app when there’s no network connection    22  Chapter 1  Introducing Progressive Web Apps    service worker caching , holds new or updated records for upload later when there’s a network  connection  service worker caching coupled with background processing , and notifies users  when new push messages arrive  service worker background processing .  On systems that don’t support web manifest files and or service workers? The app works the same  way it did before you added the web manifest file or service worker to the app. When you access  the app, the app content and data are requested in real time from one or more servers.  PWA Market Impact So, what impacts are PWAs having in the market? Development organizations quickly  adopted the technology because the progressive enhancement nature of the approach enables  development teams to dramatically affect performance  for any user running a browser that  supports it  for their users with just a few small, simple changes. When users run the app on a  browser that doesn’t support PWA technologies, they won’t notice anything different—the app  simply continues to work as it always had.  Web app performance, especially on mobile devices, suddenly seems better for some apps. That’s  because many app developers implement web manifest files and service workers, and these apps  now actively manage their client-side behavior  using background processing and caching  to the  user’s benefit.  Users engage more with PWA-enabled apps. That’s just because the apps are snappier  load faster   and work even when the mobile device its running on doesn’t have a network connection. The  app might not have all its features when offline, but it still works, and that’s likely all that it takes  to make users happy.  Modern web application frameworks and cross-platform development tools adopted PWAs in a  big way. For example, React, a very popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces  UIs    their words, not mine , preloads its default sample project with a service worker automatically.  It disables it by default, but all you must do to turn a React app into a PWA is change one line of  code, as described in Listing 1.1.  Listing 1.1  Sample React app index.js import React from 'react'; import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'; import '. index.css'; import App from '. App'; import * as serviceWorker from '. serviceWorker';   ReactDOM.render  , document.getElementById 'root'  ;      if you want your app to work offline and load faster, you    can change unregister   to register   below. Note this comes    with some pitfalls. Learn more about service workers:    https:  bit.ly CRA-PWA serviceWorker.unregister  ;   Wrap-Up  23  I’ve been doing a lot of work lately using the Ionic Framework. Ionic is a cross-platform UI and  component framework for building mobile and desktop apps. Until a short time ago, Ionic apps  were typically built using Angular, but the Ionic team recently switched to web components  and Stencil  their open web component compiler  and published a PWA Toolkit that delivers a  PWA-first approach to web apps.  Most important, PWAs are easier  much, much easier  to create than native mobile apps. That  means these apps cost less to make and maintain. When you package a PWA in an Apache  Cordova, Ionic Capacitor, or GitHub Electron app, you address the needs of users who want a  native version for mobile devices or desktop computers.  The technology is so popular that research firm Gartner predicts that by 2020, 50% of consumer  mobile apps will be PWAs  I would give you an online reference for this, but that statement is  everywhere online . But you knew that, right? You already purchased, borrowed, or stole this  book to learn how to create PWAs.  PWAs and App Stores Developers build native mobile apps for many reasons, but one of them is so that they can  distribute their apps through the mobile device platform’s public app store. While you can install  a PWA by just opening a web app in the mobile browser  you’ll learn all about this in the next  chapter , the mobile platform vendors trained their users to look for apps in the app stores. This  means that users looking for your app are going to look for it in their phone’s app store first.  Some interesting things are happening in this space. In early 2019, Google announced Trusted  Web Activity5  TWA  for Android. TWA enables developers to bundle a PWA into a native mobile  app for Android. A TWA is essentially a chromeless  no browser UI , full-screen Chrome browser  inside an Android app. With it, you get a PWA packaged with a browser in a native app—fresh and  ready for deployment through the Google Play Store.  Microsoft took a different approach, announcing in mid-2018 that developers can publish their  PWAs to the Microsoft Store. If they don’t publish their app to the store, Microsoft will do it  for them anyway  if the PWA meets specific criteria . You’ll learn more about this in Chapter 8,  “Assessment, Automation, and Deployment.”  Wrap-Up In this chapter, I gave you a quick introduction to Progressive Web Apps. You’ll find a lot more  material online and many authors who dig deeper into the marketing and engagement side  of PWAs. Since this is really a book about service workers, I want to get to coding as quickly as  possible.  In the next chapter, I show you all about how to make your PWA installable using service workers  and web manifest files. After that, the remainder of the book is all about service workers and  everything you can do with them.  5.  https:  developers.google.com web updates 2019 02 using-twa   This page intentionally left blank    2 Web App Manifest Files  One of the features of Progressive Web Apps  PWAs  is the ability to configure a web app so users  can install the app on the device running the app. Mobile users have been able to do this sort of  thing for a long time, through the Save to Home Screen option available in mobile browsers, but  PWAs deliver a better user experience.  The component that delivers this capability to PWAs is an app’s web app manifest file. In this  chapter, I introduce web app manifests and show you how you can use them to make your web  app installable.  Note Throughout the remainder of the book, I refer to a web app manifest by its full name but may  also refer to it as a manifest or manifest file.        For those who already know a bit about manifests and PWAs, the placement of this chapter may  seem odd because it takes more than just a manifest file to make a web app installable. We talk in  more depth later about the requirements for installability, but an app must meet specific criteria  and have a manifest file and a service worker installed to be installable. The rest of the book  covers service workers in detail, so rather than stick a chapter that isn’t about service workers in  the middle of the book, I decided to cover this topic now and leave the remainder of the book all  about service workers.  For the purpose of the examples in this chapter, I’ve added a simple service worker, just to make  installation possible, but I provide only cursory coverage of the topic. You’ll get more than  enough coverage in the following chapters, so I ask you to just ignore the service worker for now  with the promise that you’ll learn all you need to know later in the book.  If you’re not happy with this approach, please skip this chapter and come back to it after you’ve  completed Chapter 3, “Service Workers.”  In this chapter, we use the first of several apps I created for this book, the Tip Calculator shown  in Figure 2.1. It is a simple single page app  SPA  that renders a rudimentary tip calculator. When  users open the app, they enter a meal cost in the input field, and the app automatically calculates  several tip options based on the overall quality of the meal  food, service, environment, etc. .   10  Chapter 2  Web App Manifest Files  You can access the app today at https:  learningpwa.com tipcalc, and the full source for the  app is in the book’s GitHub repository at https:  github.com johnwargo learning-pwa-code in  the chapter-02 folder. I’d like to give a special shout out to my friend Scott Good who took my  horrible-looking app and converted it  through the application of some masterful styling  into  the beautiful page you see in the figure  Scott suggested his version is “less horrible” but I decided  to stick with “beautiful page” .  We start with a rudimentary version of the app  Tip Calc 1.0 , then enhance it throughout this  chapter by adding a web app manifest to give users a better installed app experience.  Figure 2.1  Tip Calculator App  Another great learning example of an installable web app is Google’s Air Horner app   https:  airhorner.com  with source at https:  github.com GoogleChromeLabs airhorn .   Save to Home Screen  11  Save to Home Screen Browser users can install web apps on the system desktop and device home screens today. For  example, in Chrome  and most Chrome-based browsers  running on a desktop PC, just open  the Chrome menu  the three vertical dots on the upper-right corner of the browser window   and select More Tools, then Create Shortcut. Chrome will prompt you for a title for the shortcut,  grabbing the app’s favicon to use in the shortcut icon, and save it to the desktop.  On Android devices, you open the browser menu and select Add to Home screen, as shown in  Figure 2.2. For iOS devices, the process is similar: in the browser, tap the Share button in the bot- tom of the browser window and select the Add to Home Screen button, highlighted in Figure 2.3.  Figure 2.2  Add to Home Screen Option on Android  Chrome Browser    12  Chapter 2  Web App Manifest Files  Figure 2.3   iPhone Share Button  Safari Browser   Next, the browser gives you a chance to name the shortcut, as shown in Figure 2.4.   Save to Home Screen  13  Figure 2.4  Setting the Home Screen Icon Title  The browser then gives you a chance to decide where you want the shortcut placed, or you can  let the browser do it for you, as shown in Figure 2.5. Note that on iOS, Safari doesn’t give you a  choice—it just throws the icon wherever the device wants to put it.   14  Chapter 2  Web App Manifest Files  Figure 2.5  Setting Home Screen Icon Placement  Finally, the Figure 2.6 shows the shortcut where I placed it in the top-left corner of the device  home screen.  When you tap the icon, the device opens the browser and renders the same page you see in  Figure 2.1. This is not too horrible a user experience, but it could be better, right? The user  probably doesn’t want that huge Chrome logo covering a portion of the shortcut, and opening  the browser with all its chrome doesn’t make this app feel like an app. Also, you probably want  the app shortcut in the applications list as well, since not all users want a lot of icons on their  home screen.   Save to Home Screen  15  Figure 2.6  Home Screen Icon Added  Note The word chrome with a lowercase c is used to describe the browser’s UI elements outside of  the web page rendered in the browser  e.g., menu, address input, borders, toolbar, and so on   and should not be confused with Chrome, Google’s browser.        Another problem with this approach is that the act of “installing” the app is an out-of-app  experience. Users must interact with the browser’s menu system to save the app for later access.  PWAs, through the web app manifest file, solve this problem and a few more.   16  Chapter 2  Web App Manifest Files  Making a Web App Installable OK, so I told you that adding a web app manifest file to your web app enables you to make the app  installable; throughout the remainder of this chapter, I’ll show you how.  Web App Manifest1 is an evolving specification published by the World Wide Web Consortium   W3C . The specification “defines a JSON-based manifest file that provides developers with a  centralized place to put metadata associated with a web application.” It describes how user agents   browsers  should act when a manifest file is linked to a web application. As Google has done the  most to support web manifests on Chrome, it has a lot of good information available on its Web  App Manifest page in an article written by Matt Gaunt and Paul Kinlan.2  Note Web app manifests aren’t supported in all modern browsers; in fact, as I type this, support  is rather dismal. For example, as popular as the Safari browser is for iOS and macOS users,  Apple still hasn’t added full support for PWAs; its Safari browser supports manifest files but  not the events you need to install the PWA on the device. The good news is that browser developers frequently update their products, so your favorite  browser should have support soon. The best way to tell if browsers your app targets support  the technology is to check the Can I Use site.3 Normally, I’d include a screenshot of the results  here, but things change so quickly that it would be a waste of time to do so.       For PWAs, the metadata we’re talking about are properties in the manifest file that define what  the app looks like when it’s installed  basically just the app icon and title  and runs  splash screen,  browser chrome options, etc.  and how the browser launches and runs the app when the user  clicks or taps the app icon.  We’ll get to the specific format of this file in a bit, but first let’s talk about how a browser decides  that an app’s installable. The criteria browsers use to determine if a web app is installable varies  depending on the browser. Using Google’s Chrome browser as an example, it looks like this:   Is not already installed on the local system.   Meets a user engagement heuristic; basically, users must look like they’re interested in the   app.   Includes a web app manifest that defines a minimum set of properties  a short_name   and or name, the icons array must reference icons at 192 and 512 pixels, a start_url, and  display property of fullscreen, standalone, or minimal-ui . You’ll learn more about  these properties later.   Served over HTTPS  or localhost for testing .   Has registered a service worker with a fetch event handler.  1.  https:  www.w3.org TR appmanifest  2.  https:  developers.google.com web fundamentals web-app-manifest  3.  https:  caniuse.com feat=web-app-manifest   Anatomy of a Web App Manifest  17  To make a web app manifest available to your web app, you must add a link reference to it in the    section of the web app’s index.html file:     In this example, the link reference points to a file called app.webmanifest located in the root  folder of the web app. For the chapter’s sample project, the   section looks a little like this:           Tip Calculator                 Now that I’ve shown how a browser uses a manifest and how to link the manifest into the app,  let’s talk about what goes in the manifest file.  Anatomy of a Web App Manifest A web app manifest is a simple JavaScript Object Notation  JSON  file. The file doesn’t have  to have a specific file name or file extension; all that matters is that it contains a JSON object  with specific properties as shown in Listing 2.1. In the early days, developers usually called it  something like manifest.json, but nowadays the convention is to use a file name with the  .webmanifest extension. We’re going to use the file shown in Listing 2.2 later, but for now let’s  use it as an example of a simple .manifest file.  Listing 2.1  A Sample Web App Manifest File  {   "short_name": "TipCalc",   "name": "Tip Calculator",   "icons": [     {       "src": "icons android-icon-192x192.png",       "sizes": "192x192",       "type": "image png"     },     {       "src": "icons android-icon-512x512.png",       "sizes": "512x512",       "type": "image png"     }   ],   "start_url": " index.html?source=pwa",   "display": "standalone",   "background_color": "FFFFFF",   "theme_color": "3653B3" }   18  Chapter 2  Web App Manifest Files  Note If an app’s index.html file has multiple link elements referencing manifest files, the browser will  use the first one  in tree order  and ignore all others, even if the first reference is invalid.       In the sections that follow, I highlight the manifest properties used in this chapter’s sample app,  then cover some of the other options as well before showing you the app in action.  Setting the App Name A web app’s manifest file uses one of two JSON string values to define the name or title for the  app: short_name and name. According to the specification, it’s up to the browser to decide which  one to use when displaying the app icon or information about the app on the device where the  app is installed.  "short_name": "TipCalc", "name": "Tip Calculator",  Both properties are string values, and your manifest can have either or both values specified. In  my testing in the Chrome browser on the desktop and on an Android device, Chrome uses the  name property value in the installation prompt and the applications list. On Android, it uses the  short_name property value for the app title on the screen.  For installable apps, you must provide a value for either the name or short_name property.  Setting App Icons A web app’s manifest file uses the icons property to define the array of icon objects for the app.  The browser uses one of these icons, depending on the screen resolution of the device, for the  shortcut icon for the app on the desktop or mobile device home screen. Populate the array with  the list of icon files you have defined for the app, as shown in the following example:  "icons": [   {     "src": " icons app_icon_192x192.png",     "sizes": "192x192",     "type": "image png"   }, {     "src": " icons app_icon_512x512.png",     "sizes": "512x512",     "type": "image png"   } ],  Note Requirements will differ based on the browser running the app, but according to Google’s  documentation, at a minimum you’ll need icons 192 × 192 and 512 × 512 pixels. The browser  scales one of the available icons to fit the target device’s requirements. The app source  includes some extra icons at different resolutions if you want to add them to the manifest.         Anatomy of a Web App Manifest  19  When you create the icon files for your app, pay special attention to how the icons render  on the target device. They must render properly against any possible home screen or desktop  background, so you may want to skip transparency unless your app icon can render cleanly  against any background.  For installable apps, you must provide an icons property containing icons at 192 and 512 pixels.  Configuring Display Mode The web app manifest specification enables developers to set how the browser renders an installed  app’s UI using the display property. The available options control how much of the browser’s UI   its chrome  displays around the app window. The supported options are   fullscreen   standalone   minimal-ui   browser  Each option is described in the following sections.  Remember, one of the criteria for a browser to consider an app installable is a display property  set to fullscreen, standalone, or minimal-ui. The browser property value does not affect  PWA app installation through the web app manifest.  The specification allows developers to use display-mode in Cascading Style Sheets  CSS  media  selectors in their web apps to adjust the UI styling depending on which display mode is in play  when the app launches, as shown in the following CSS example:  @media all and  display-mode: fullscreen  {    * some styling stuff for the `fullscreen` version*    }  Using this approach, you can add a toolbar or status bar to the top of the screen to mimic the look  of a native mobile app when the app is installed as a full screen app.  fullscreen Display Mode With display set to fullscreen, the installed web app opens without any browser UI and con- sumes the entire screen, as shown in Figure 2.7.  If the browser doesn’t support fullscreen mode, it falls back to standalone mode.   20  Chapter 2  Web App Manifest Files  Figure 2.7  The Tip Calculator App in fullscreen Display Mode  standalone Display Mode With display set to standalone, the installed web app opens without any browser UI  chrome   but does not consume the entire screen. Instead, the device displays the app as it would display  other native apps. On Android, it doesn’t hide the device status bar, as shown in Figure 2.8, but  may show other UI elements depending on the browser.  If the browser doesn’t support standalone mode, it falls back to minimal-ui mode.   Anatomy of a Web App Manifest  21  Figure 2.8  The Tip Calculator App in standalone Display Mode  minimal-ui Display Mode With display set to minimal-ui, the installed web app opens with a subset of the browser  window’s default UI, as shown in Figure 2.9. In this example, the Android Chrome browser shows  the address bar but none of the other navigational elements  for example, the next and previous  buttons . Don’t forget, it’s the browser developer, not the W3C, who decides what UI to display in  this mode.  If the browser doesn’t support minimal-ui mode, it falls back to browser mode.   22  Chapter 2  Web App Manifest Files  Figure 2.9  The Tip Calculator App in minimal-ui Display Mode  browser Display Mode With display set to browser, the installed web app opens using the standard way the device  opens hyperlinks  URLs , which basically means opening a new window  or tab  using the default  browser app, as shown in Figure 2.10.  Remember, browser display mode isn’t supported for installable PWAs, so the figure shows the  results after saving the app to the home screen, not installed using an in-app installation process.  There is no fallback mode for the browser display mode; all browsers conforming to the  specification must support browser.   Anatomy of a Web App Manifest  23  Figure 2.10  The Tip Calculator App in browser Display Mode  Setting the Installed App’s Start URL A browser uses the start_url property to define the URL used to launch the app. Using it is just  a recommendation in the specification, so it’s possible that the browser will just ignore it. There’s  a lot of flexibility in how you use this property for your PWAs; how you configure it depends on  how your app is coded and served.  Some examples show setting start_url like this:  "start_url": ".",  In this case, it instructs the browser to open the root folder for the web app. Other examples  suggest using the following:  "start_url": ". ",   24  Chapter 2  Web App Manifest Files  This is essentially doing the same thing but applying a Unix convention for specifying the current  folder.  Other examples show doing something like this:  "start_url": " ?utm_source=homescreen",  or this:  "start_url": " ?source=pwa",  These examples tack a query parameter on to the URL, enabling the app to distinguish whether  the app was loaded directly from the hosted site via the browser or launched as an installed PWA.  For example, when loading an app from the server using https:  myapp.com, if the query string  doesn’t include the parameter, the app knows the request comes directly from a URL typed or  clicked in the browser. When the user launches the PWA version, the extra query string parameter  tells the app it’s a PWA, and based on that knowledge, the app can then do things differently if it  wants to.  The query string parameter doesn’t have to be anything special; you could use  ?pwa=1 or   ?pwa=99 if you wanted. How you use this is up to you; you could change the page content to  somehow show it’s a PWA  like changing the background color or adding “ PWA ” to the first  heading.  Later, when we’re adding a web manifest to the Tip Calculator app, I’ll have you install a local web  server to use for testing. The server doesn’t enable you to set the startup page for the server, so  I changed the start_url property value to  "start_url": " index.html?source=pwa",  This forces the browser to open the folder’s index.html file and enables my PWA to install  correctly in a variety of environments.  On the book’s web site, I have the Tip Calculator app serving from a subfolder in the site,  https:  learningpwa.com tipcalc , so I had to do things a little differently. For my hosting  environment, I had to configure my manifest file with the following:  "start_url": " tipcalc index.html?source=pwa", "scope": " tipcalc ",  In this example, I had to specify the target folder for my app plus add the scope parameter pointing  to the same folder. If I didn’t have the scope parameter defined, the app would install, but when  I launched it, the hosted site’s 404  not found  error page displayed instead of the Tip Calculator.  As Gaunt and Kinlan describe it:  The scope defines the set of URLs that the browser considers to be within your app, and  is used to decide when the user has left the app. The scope controls the URL structure  that encompasses all the entry and exit points in your web app. Your start_url must  reside within the scope.  In this case, I’m using the scope property to tell the installed app that the root of all its code  begins at the tipcalc folder.   Anatomy of a Web App Manifest  25  Warning If the web app contains links that point to resources outside the scope defined in the manifest  file, the browser will load the links in the current browser window. If the target page doesn’t  provide navigation help to get the user back to the launching PWA, the user will be stuck in the  new location. To avoid this, include the target="_blank" attribute in any HTML anchor     tags on the  page; with this in place, clicking those links will open them in a new browser window and leave  the PWA window intact:      Learning PWA      Setting App Options All I’ve shown so far are manifest options required to make an app installable. In this section,  I cover other options that are useful but not required to install your PWA.  When launching an installed PWA, the browser builds a simple splash screen using the app icon  and title  defined by the name or short_name properties in the manifest  and displays that screen  while it loads your app’s start page and other content. The background for the splash screen  defaults to white, but if your app’s main page uses a different color, the transition from the splash  screen’s stark white to your app’s background color may be jarring for users. To improve the user  experience, use the manifest file’s background_color property to set the background color for  the splash screen to match the background color of your app’s main page. With this in place, the  UI transitions more smoothly from the splash screen to the app.  In the manifest file for the Tip Calculator app, I’ve set the background color to white to match the  background color in the icon file, as shown here:  "background_color": "FFFFFF",  If I was better at making app icons, I’d put a fancy border around the app icon, leaving the icon  background white, then use a contrasting, but cool, color for the background so the icon pops off  the page as it loads. I’ll leave this work to you.  Additional Options The complete list of supported properties is provided in the specification at https:  www.w3.org  TR appmanifest. There are just a couple more I want to bring to your attention here. Look to the  specification for other interesting things you can do with manifest files.  On compatible browsers such as Google Chrome, the manifest’s theme_color property is a hint  that tells the browser what color to use for styling around the installed app  for example, the  styling of the address bar . For the Tip Calculator app, I set the theme color to match the blue in  the app icon’s jacket sleeve:  "theme_color": "3653B3",  You can also force an orientation for your installed app using  "orientation": "landscape",   26  Chapter 2  Web App Manifest Files  Available options are defined in the OrientationLockType defined at https:  www.w3.org  TR screen-orientation screenorientation-interface and include any, landscape, portrait,  and many others. One example of this property in action is a game app that must operate in  landscape mode for the best user experience.  Controlling the Installation Experience All right, we’ve spent a lot of time in this chapter talking about the manifest file and how you  can use it to describe how you want the app to look and work when installed as a PWA. In this  section, I cover the capabilities exposed through the browser that give developers control over the  installation process.  If you add the manifest file to the Tip Calculator’s index.html file and the app meets the other  criteria for installation described earlier in “Making a Web App Installable,” when you load the  app in the Chrome browser, the browser displays the installation prompt shown in Figure 2.11.  Figure 2.11  Chrome App Installation Banner   This is the browser’s helper, showing users that they can add this app to the device’s home screen.  Firefox does it a little differently, showing a badge in the address bar, as shown in Figure 2.12.  Preparing to Code  27  Figure 2.12  Firefox App Installation Badge  Note You may be wondering why you’re not seeing a lot of iOS screenshots in the chapter so far.  That’s because at the time I wrote the app, Apple’s Safari browser didn’t support installing a  PWA using the mechanisms discussed in this part of the chapter. Safari may support installing  PWAs by the time you read this; if it does, installing PWAs should work the same way it does  on Android. I’m not showing any iOS examples because iOS doesn’t support installing PWAs either  no  matter which browser you use . You can’t even add an icon to the home page using Chrome on  iOS. It’s a dismal state of affairs that I hope will get better over time.        What if you want more control over this process? What if you want to display the installation  prompt inside your app or want to offer installation only after the user logs into your app or  completes some initial configuration? Well, the browser exposes capabilities enabling you to  do so.  Right before the browser displays the installation banner, it fires the beforeinstallprompt  event. A web app listening for that event can manage the process any way it wants to. I’ll show  how to do this later when we make the Tip Calculator app installable.  Preparing to Code Before we start modifying code to make the Tip Calculator installable, you must install some  software prerequisites you’ll use as you follow along. Who knows, you may already have them  installed  you should .   28  Chapter 2  Web App Manifest Files  Node.JS To test the PWA capabilities of the Tip Calculator app, you must run the app through a web server,  so shortly, I’m going to have you install a node-based web server. If your development workstation  already has Node.js installed, then skip ahead to the next paragraph. If not, hop over to https:   nodejs.org en  and follow the instructions to install the client on your development workstation.  To confirm that you have Node.js installed, open a new terminal window and execute the  following command:  node -v  If the terminal returns a version number  mine reports v10.16.0 , then Node.js is properly  installed. If you see an error message, then you have some work to do resolving the error before  continuing.  To test the web app locally, we’ll use the HTTP Server app from https:  github.com http-party  http-server. The server is node based, so to install it, just open a terminal window and execute the  following command:  npm install http-server -g  When the installation completes, execute the http-server command, and the system should  respond with something like the following:  Starting up http-server, serving .  Available on:   http:  172.20.154.161:8080   http:  172.28.224.1:8080   http:  192.168.86.247:8080   http:  192.168.60.1:8080   http:  192.168.19.1:8080   http:  127.0.0.1:8080 Hit CTRL-C to stop the server  If that’s what you see, then you’re good. Hit Ctrl-C to kill the process. If not, look for any error  messages and troubleshoot the installation until you get it right.  Git Client I published the source code for the book in a GitHub repository at https:  github.com johnwargo  learning-pwa-code. The easiest way to get the code, and to update it when I publish changes,  is through Git. If your development workstation already has Git installed, then you’re good.  If not, hop over to https:  git-scm.com  and follow the instructions to install the client on your  development workstation.  To confirm that you have Git installed, open a new terminal window and execute the following  command:  git --version   App Installation in Action  29  If the terminal returns a version number  mine reports git version 2.22.0.windows.1  then  Git is properly installed. If you see an error message, then you have some work to do resolving the  error before continuing.  With Git installed, open a terminal window or command prompt, navigate to the folder where  you want the book’s code stored, then execute the following command:  git clone https:  github.com johnwargo learning-pwa-code  Once the cloning process completes, navigate the terminal into the cloned project’s  \learning-pwa-code\chapter-02\tip-calculator-start folder. This folder contains the  non-PWA version of the Tip Calculator web app, and that’s where we’ll work.  Note If you want to leave this version of the app in a pristine state, then copy the project’s  tip-calculator-start folder to a different location and work there.        Visual Studio Code I use Visual Studio Code as my primary code editor for most projects; this isn’t because I work for  Microsoft  I do , but because it’s a very capable editor and the large catalog of available extensions  enables me to configure the editor environment with some really cool capabilities to make coding  easier. If you haven’t tried it out yet, hop over to https:  code.visualstudio.com  and give it a try.  As you’ll learn later, there’s a feature in Visual Studio Code I use in the project’s JavaScript files to  automatically catch errors in my code as I write them. This alone is the best reason to give Visual  Studio Code a try.  App Installation in Action OK, so we’ve spent a lot of time so far learning all about manifest files and how you use them to  make a PWA installable. In this section, we take an initial version of the Tip Calculator app and  add stuff to it to turn it into a PWA and make it installable. At the end of this section, you’ll have  the Tip Calculator app running against a local web server and be able to test app installation in  the desktop browser.  Note We’re going to test the app modifications only on desktop browsers because accessing the app  on a mobile device is more complicated. One of the requirements to make an app installable is  to access it over a TLS  HTTPS  connection. To do this in your local development environment  requires that you generate a TLS certificate for the local web server or host the app on a web  server somewhere. Hosting the app on a web server requires a web server, a custom domain,  and a TLS certificate—setting up all of that is beyond the scope of this book.         30  Chapter 2  Web App Manifest Files  Adding a Service Worker As explained earlier, installable apps must have a service worker registered, and the service worker  must offer specific capabilities. The remaining chapters deal with service workers in detail, so for  now we’re just going to use a simple one I included in the project and dig into how they work  in later chapters. I’ll explain a little about what’s going on here, but I promise you’ll get all the  details you need on service workers starting with the next chapter.  Open the project’s index.html file, and add the following code to the end of the file’s    section:         does the browser support service workers?   if  'serviceWorker' in navigator  {        then register our service worker     navigator.serviceWorker.register '. sw.js'        .then function  reg  {            display a success message         console.log `Service Worker Registration  Scope: ${reg.scope} ` ;       }        .catch function  error  {            display an error message         console.log `Service Worker Error  ${error} ` ;       } ;   } else {        happens when the app isn't served over a TLS connection  HTTPS      console.warn 'Service Worker not available' ;   }          Tip In this sample code and much of the code in the remainder of the book, I use JavaScript’s tem- plate literals4 to format console output with values from the running app. Pay special attention  to the quote marks used: templates use the back tick  `  character, whereas nontemplate code  uses the single-quote mark  ' .    This code checks whether the browser supports service workers, then installs the service worker if  it does or writes a warning to the console if it doesn’t. The service worker is in a file called sw.js;  it doesn’t do much of anything—it’s there just to help make the app installable  fill one of the  installable requirements .  Could you put this code in an external JavaScript file? Yes. There’s no reason it’s here instead of in  a JavaScript file. I use that approach in the remaining chapters of this book.  4.  https:  developer.mozilla.org en-US docs Web JavaScript Reference Template_literals   App Installation in Action  31  Next, add the following line to the   section of the project’s index.html file:     This code links the manifest file  we haven’t created yet  to the web app. Listing 2.2 shows the  complete source code for the project’s index.htm file.  Listing 2.2  Tip Calculator index.html File               Tip Calculator                                                            <link rel="icon" type="image png" sizes="192x192"     href="icons android-chrome-192x192.png">                                              does the browser support service workers?     if  'serviceWorker' in navigator  {          then register our service worker       navigator.serviceWorker.register '. sw.js'          .then function  reg  {              display a success message           console.log `Service Worker Registration  Scope: ${reg.scope} ` ;         }          .catch function  error  {   32  Chapter 2  Web App Manifest Files               display an error message           console.log `Service Worker Error  ${error} ` ;         } ;     } else {          happens when the app isn't served over a TLS connection  HTTPS        console.warn 'Service Worker not available' ;     }                   Tip Calculator           Meal Cost                             Rating         Tip         Amount                     Poor         10%         $0.00                     OK         15%         $0.00                     Good         18%         $0.00                     Great         20%         $0.00                     Excellent         22%         $0.00          App Installation in Action  33                Adding a Web Manifest File The app’s web app manifest file tells the browser how to install and run the app. We don’t have  one yet, so create a file called app.webmanifest in the same folder as the project’s index.html  file. Populate the new file with the JSON code from Listing 2.1.  Running the App Before we make the app fancy, lets test it in the browser to make sure the manifest file is  configured correctly. Open a terminal window, navigate to the folder where you modified the  code, and execute the following command:  http-server  The server task should report something like the following:  Starting up http-server, serving .  Available on:   http:  172.20.154.161:8080   http:  172.28.224.1:8080   http:  192.168.86.247:8080   http:  192.168.60.1:8080   http:  192.168.19.1:8080   http:  127.0.0.1:8080 Hit CTRL-C to stop the server  Due to security concerns I’ll explain in Chapter 3, “Service Workers,” a PWA will work correctly  only over an HTTPS connection or when accessed via the localhost hostname. Even though the  HTTP Server task tells you it’s listening on all those IP addresses, the browser won’t treat the app  like a PWA unless you access it through localhost. You won’t even be able to access the local web  server from an Android emulator running on the device, since localhost on the Android device  is on the actual device. To access the web server from the Android emulator, you must use the IP  address 10.0.2.2, and since that’s not localhost, Chrome won’t allow you to install the app from  that host.  Jot down the port number listed after the colon in each IP address line  for example, the 8080  in http:  172.20.154.161:8080 . Open a PWA-compatible browser  for help selecting the right  browser, see Can I Use5—in my testing on Windows, it worked only in Chrome and the Chrome- based Edge browsers  and navigate to the following URL:  http:  localhost:8080 index.html  5.  https:  caniuse.com feat=web-app-manifest   34  Chapter 2  Web App Manifest Files  substituting your actual port number for the 8080 in the example. Chances are, it will be 8080 on  most systems, but if your development workstation already has a task listening on that port, the  HTTP Server will select a different port from a range of available ports.  The Tip Calculator app should open and display the page shown in Figure 2.1. Most desktop  browsers don’t display the installation banner  see Figure 2.11 , so we won’t be able to install the  app yet. At this point, we’re just checking to make sure the browser sees the manifest correctly.  Open the browser’s developer tools and look for an Application or Service Workers tab and  select it. The browser should display manifest information, as shown in Figure 2.13. If the pane  doesn’t list any errors, you’re good and the browser should eventually allow you to install the app.  Figure 2.13  Chrome Dev Tools App Manifest Page   App Installation in Action  35  If Chrome has any issues with the manifest file, it will list them here. Some of the issues aren’t  easily understood, so see the troubleshooting section at the end of the chapter for more details.  Creating an Environment to Test the App on a Physical Device or Device  Emulator Simulator If you point a mobile device browser to https:  learningpwa.com tipcalc, you can test installing  the app on the device. This is because that version of the app fulfills many of the requirements  for the app to be installable:   Includes a web app manifest that defines a minimum set of properties  a short_name   and or name, icons must reference icons at 192 and 512 pixels, a start_url, and  display property of fullscreen, standalone, or minimal-ui .    Has a registered service worker with a fetch event handler.  Is served over HTTPS  or localhost when testing .  The first two are covered by the manifest and service worker files, but the last requirement in  that list can be done only if you have an SSL TLS certificate installed in the local web server  running on your development workstation or you’re hosting the app via a service provider that  provides the certificate. There’s an easy and relatively inexpensive way to set this up yourself. All you need is a domain   I get mine from Google Domains6 at US$12 each  and a hosting provider. For the Learning  Progressive Web Apps site, I’m hosting the app at Netlify,7 which offers a free hosting pack- age that’s perfect for your testing. All you must do is point Netlify at your web project’s GitHub  repository and it will build and host the app for free. Once you configure your domain to point  to the Netlify DNS servers and set up an SSL TLS certificate for the domain, you’re all set.  When you hit the domain from the browser on an Android device  iOS doesn’t support installing  PWAs yet  the Install button will appear, and you can install the app. The reason I’m not proposing you install a self-signed certificate in your local web server is  that you must generate your own SSL certificate, which creates all sorts of trust issues in the  browser. I don’t want to get into all that in this book  it’s about PWAs, not configuring SSL TLS  certificates .        Enhancing the Installation Process All right, remember that we want to be able to control the process, so we’re going to make some  changes to the app. Open the project’s index.html file and add the following code to the top of  the   section, right above the pagelogo div:       Install     6.  https:  domains.google   7.  https:  www.netlify.com    36  Chapter 2  Web App Manifest Files  Note The styling for this button is already in the app’s main.css file. The button is hidden by  default, so it won’t appear until we want it to.        This adds the install button the user taps or clicks to install the app.  Open the project’s  js main.js file. At the bottom of the file, add the following code:     get a handle to the install button let installButton = document.getElementById 'installButton' ;    now set the click handler for the install button installButton.onclick = doInstall;  This creates an installbutton variable that points to the install button page element  we’ll need  this later to hide the button after installation  and adds a click event handler for the button.  Now, let’s start working on the installation process, which all centers around the  beforeinstallprompt event described earlier. At the bottom of the file, add the following code:     create an object we'll use to hold the reference to the PWA     install event let deferredPrompt;      now add an event listener to respond to the event. Right     before the browser installs the PWA, it fires the     beforeinstallprompt event. Here, we'll manage the     installation ourselves window.addEventListener 'beforeinstallprompt',  event  => {        don't allow the browser to do its install now, we want to         do it when the user taps our install button     event.preventDefault  ;        stash the event object so we can use it later  when the         user taps the install button      deferredPrompt = event;        now unhide the Install button so the user can tap it!     installButton.style.display = 'block'; } ;  The code creates the deferredPrompt object, which we’ll use later to capture the event object  created with the beforeinstallprompt event. You’ll see why this is important in a little bit.  Next, it creates the beforeinstallprompt event listener. The first thing the listener does is make  a call to event.preventDefault  , which tells the browser not to worry about installing the  app and should suppress the installation banner shown in Figure 2.11. The suppression feature is  in the desktop version of Chrome today and hasn’t made it into the Android version of Chrome  yet, but it should be there by the time you read this book.  Next, the code stores the event object passed to the listener in the deferredPrompt object  created earlier. We’ll use methods on this object later to actually install the app.   App Installation in Action  37  Finally, the code sets the button’s display style to block, unhiding the button on the page so the  user can now see it. With that in place, we now need the code that does the installation. Above  the beforeinstallprompt event listener we just added to the project’s js main.js file, add the  following function:  function doInstall   {      we've tapped the install button, so hide it   installButton.style.display = 'none';      execute the deferred installation prompt   deferredPrompt.prompt  ;      wait for the response from the deferred prompt   deferredPrompt.userChoice.then  res  => {        did the user approve installation?     if  res.outcome === 'accepted'  {       console.log 'doInstall: accepted' ;     } else {       console.log 'doInstall: declined' ;     }        clear the deferred prompt object so we        can only do this once     deferredPrompt = null;   } ; }  As described in the comments, this code   Hides the Install button  no need to install the app twice .   Calls the prompt method on the deferredPrompt object; we captured that object   specifically for this reason, so we could call its prompt method later to prompt the user to  install the app.   Waits for the user to decide whether or not to install the app.   Once the user decides what to do, logs the results to the console and clears the   deferredPrompt object so it’s not used again.  When the browser fires the beforeinstallprompt event, it passes an object that the app uses  later to prompt the user to install the app. This code just defers the installation and puts it in the  hands of the app through the Install button.  In the terminal window, press Ctrl-C to kill the server process, then execute the http-server  command again  this reloads the modified code into the server . Next, refresh the Tip Calculator  page in the browser and you should see the Install button appear. Remember, the browser shows  the installation prompt when the app encounters a user engagement heuristic, which means it  may take a while to show the prompt. When the prompt appears, use it to install the app locally,  then close the browser and open the installed shortcut to see how it works.  Some operating systems install the app on the desktop  Windows , while others install the  app in an apps area in the browser. In my testing on Windows, Chrome installs the PWA in  chrome:  apps as well as on the desktop. Figure 2.14 shows the Chrome Apps page with the  installed Tip Calculator app.   38  Chapter 2  Web App Manifest Files  Figure 2.14  Chrome Apps Page  Deleting the PWA from the apps page  right-click and select Remove from Chrome…, as shown  in Figure 2.15  also removes it from the desktop. The new Edge browser  based on Chromium   from Microsoft installs the app in the apps area but not on the desktop.  Figure 2.15  Chrome Removing an Installed PWA   App Installation in Action  39  The browser fires one additional event during the installation process: the appinstalled event.  At the bottom of the project’s js main.js file, add the following event listener:     register an event listener for after the app installs window.addEventListener 'appinstalled',  event  => {   console.log 'App Installed' ; } ;  An app uses this event to perform any post-installation cleanup or anything else it wants to do  after the installation completes.  Finally, do you remember when I mentioned that you could pass an extra query parameter when  launching the installed PWA? We set this up using the start_url in the manifest file:  "start_url": " index.html?source=pwa",  This configures the installed shortcut to pass ?source=pwa on the query string when launching  the PWA. If you add the following code to the project’s main.js file, it changes the Tip Calculator  page title when it runs as an installed PWA:     did we launch as a PWA? var urlParams = new URLSearchParams window.location.search ;    look for the source parameter, if it's `pwa` then it's installed if  urlParams.get 'source'  === 'pwa'  {   console.log 'Launched as PWA' ;      add the PWA moniker to the title   let theTitle = document.getElementById 'title' ;   theTitle.innerHTML = theTitle.innerHTML + '  PWA '; }  Listing 2.3 lists the complete source for the project’s main.js file.

Remember when I said  that Visual Studio Code added a special feature that enabled me to write better code? With  that directive in a .js file, Visual Studio Code applies the TypeScript compiler to the code  as I type, looking for errors in real time—even when I’m editing a JavaScript file instead of a  TypeScript file. This means that I get the benefits of TypeScript without using TypeScript for my  app. You can read more about this feature here: https:  code.visualstudio.com docs nodejs  working-with-javascript_type-checking-javascript.        Troubleshooting Browsers don’t tell you much when processing a PWA for installation. Basically, it works or it  doesn’t work, and to pop up warnings and errors would only confuse users. So, with that in mind,  adding a manifest and service worker to an app to make it installable either works or it doesn’t.  There are some things you can do to debug the process. One of the simplest is to put breakpoints  in the code, and watch the process through the browser developer tools. I’m also a big fan of  adding a bunch of console.log   calls in my code so I can watch it run through the console.  Most modern browsers offer developer tools that understand manifest files and service workers.  Figure 2.16 shows the App Manifest pane in the Chrome Developer tools. Whenever an app links a  manifest file, information about the manifest appears in this pane. When the browser encounters  an error parsing the manifest, or the manifest doesn’t meet minimum requirements to make  an app installable, it will display error messages like the ones you see in the figure. In this case,  I configured the scope property incorrectly and had some error with my service worker, which  had me scratching my head.   42  Chapter 2  Web App Manifest Files  Figure 2.16  Chrome Developer Tools: App Manifest Pane  Manifest Generation and More Even though Apple doesn’t fully support them on iOS or Safari, PWAs have been around for  a while, so there are a lot of nice tools around to help make your life easier. I cover some tools  in Chapter 8, “Assessment, Automation, and Deployment,” but here’s a list of some free tools  available online to help you configure web app manifests for your PWA:   PWA Builder: https:  www.pwabuilder.com   Web App Manifest Generator: https:  app-manifest.firebaseapp.com    another  Web App Manifest Generator: https:  tomitm.github.io appmanifest   PWA Fire Developer: https:  pwafire.org developer tools get-manifest  Google also publishes the pwcompat library,8 which brings web app manifest support to  noncompatible browsers, enabling a PWA-like experience on older browsers.   Wrap-Up In this chapter, I showed you how to add a manifest file to a web app to make it installable on  compatible browsers. In the next chapter and beyond, we’ll dig into all the cool things you can do  with service workers.  8.  https:  github.com GoogleChromeLabs pwacompat   3 Service Workers  If building Progressive Web Apps  PWAs  is like building a house, the web app manifest file is like  a real estate agent working to get people interested in buying your house and prepping it so that  it’s move-in ready for buyers. Service workers, on the other hand, are live-in general contractors  working behind the scenes to make sure the house has a solid foundation and all the walls stay up  after the buyer moves in.  This chapter introduces service workers and shows how to use them to enable cool background  processing in your web app. Here we build a foundation of what service workers do and how  they do it, starting with simple web app resource caching and the service worker lifecycle. In the   chapters that follow, I show how to add additional functionality to an app’s service worker to give  the app some pizazz.  PWA News For this and the next few chapters of the book, you’ll work with the PWA News web app shown in  Figure 3.1. The app is publicly available at https:  pwa-news.com, but you’ll run a version of the  app on a local server as you work through the chapter. I’d like to give a special shout out to my  friend Scott Good who created the app UI and, through the application of some masterful styling,  made it into the beautiful app you see in the figure.  The app is a simple news site, aggregating news articles on PWAs from sites around the world. The  app’s server process uses the Microsoft Bing News Search API1 to locate articles with the keyword  PWA and displays the top 20 results. The app hosts a simple About page describing the site  and  promoting the book  plus a Feedback page that renders data about how people feel about the site.  You’ll play with that one in a later chapter. In Chapter 5, “Going the Rest of the Way Offline with  Background Sync,” we’ll add the ability for visitors to submit their feedback when we talk about  going offline.  1.  https:  azure.microsoft.com en-us services cognitive-services bing-news-search-api    44  Chapter 3  Service Workers  Figure 3.1  PWA News Web Site  Introducing Service Workers A service worker is a block of JavaScript code a web app installs in the browser under certain   conditions and runs when the browser needs it to  based on events that fire . Web apps use service  workers to add additional capabilities to the app, capabilities that aren’t generally available to web  apps but are available in many mobile apps.  For install conditions, a browser installs a service worker if   The browser supports service workers.   The browser loaded the web app using a TLS  HTTPS  connection or from the system’s   localhost address  referring to the local device running the browser .   The web app loads the service worker code within the same context  from the same server   location  as the web app for which it’s associated.  Unlike with web app manifest files, most modern browsers support service workers; you can check  the current support matrix on Can I Use.2 As I write this, the following browsers support service  workers: Chrome  Google , Edge  Microsoft , Firefox  Mozilla , Opera  Opera , and Safari  Apple .   2.  https:  caniuse.com feat=serviceworkers   Introducing Service Workers  45  Many other browsers support them as well; check first if you know your app’s target audience   prefers a specific browser that’s not in that list.  Depending on how web developers take advantage of service workers in their apps, service workers:   Cache app content. Google calls service workers programmable network proxies; as you’ll see  in this chapter and the next, you have a lot of options for controlling which resources the  browser caches and which ones are pulled from the server when requested by the app. You  can even replace requested resources  files or data  dynamically at runtime using a service  worker.   Perform background processing. Web apps use service workers to deliver background  data synchronization and offline support. Service workers install in the browser, they’re  associated with the web app, but they run in the browser’s execution context. This means  they’re available to do work whenever the browser is open, even when the app is not  loaded. You’ll learn more about this in Chapter 5, “Going the Rest of the Way Offline with  Background Sync” and Chapter 6, “Push Notifications.”   Receive push notifications. With the right protocols and a backend server to send   notifications, web apps use the background processing capabilities of service workers to  enable the processing and display of push notifications sent to the app. You’ll learn more  about this in Chapter 7, “Passing Data between Service Workers and Web Applications.”  The primary reasons browsers require a TLS connection to install and enable a service worker are  those included in the bulleted list you just read through. Considering all you can do with the  capabilities described in that list, the service worker has complete control over data coming in  and out of the app. Browsers require the TLS connection to enforce that the web app and service  worker load from the same location.  Without a TLS connection and the requirement that the service worker loads from the same con- text as the web app, hackers could compromise a site and load service worker code from another  location and take complete control of the app. A rogue service worker could redirect all requests  to alternate servers, capture auth and push tokens, and more.    The Dreadful Application Cache Earlier, I said, “Web apps use service workers to add additional capabilities to the app, capabil- ities that aren’t generally available to web apps,” but that wasn’t exactly true. Web developers  have been able to implement resource caching in web apps for some time now, through an old  feature in many browsers called the Application Cache3  or just AppCache . Unfortunately, AppCache is a pretty horrible technology, as famously described in Jake  Archibald’s “Application Cache Is a Douchebag.”4 It’s so bad that the AppCache page at the  above link starts with two warnings against using it in your apps. Furthermore, it also warns  that the technology has been removed from many browsers and that the feature may cease to  work at any time. How’s that? Don’t use it.  3.  https:  developer.mozilla.org en-US docs Web HTML Using_the_application_cache 4.  https:  alistapart.com article application-cache-is-a-douchebag    46  Chapter 3  Service Workers  Developers used it because AppCache support was built into many browsers, but few devel- opers were happy with it. Writing your own cache implementation was problematic as well,  because, for performance reasons, it must run on a separate thread, which was challenging in  web apps as well. The CacheStorage5 API described in Chapter 4, “Resource Caching,” was the community’s  attempt to fix AppCache, and it’s one of the key technologies that make PWAs interesting and  useful today. My apologies for lying to you, but hopefully now you see why I did.  Of course, service workers have limitations:   Service workers don’t run unless the browser is open. The web app doesn’t have to be open,   but the browser does.   Service workers don’t have access to the web app’s document object model  DOM , but   we’ll discuss workarounds for this in Chapter 7.  The first limitation may not be a big deal depending on the browser and operating system  OS .  On many mobile devices, the browser always runs, so it’s there to run the service worker. On   desktop systems, some browsers run in the background as well or can be configured to do so.  Chrome exposes an advanced setting. Continue running background apps when Google Chrome  is closed, as highlighted in Figure 3.2.  Figure 3.2  Chrome Advanced Settings  I’ll show you more about what service workers can do and how they do it as we work through the  rest of the chapter.  Preparing to Code Throughout the remainder of the chapter, you’ll start with a base version of the PWA News site  and add a service worker to it. Then we’ll tweak and tune the service worker to demonstrate its  capabilities. Before we do that, you must configure your local development environment with the  components you’ll need.  5.  https:  developer.mozilla.org en-US docs Web API CacheStorage   Preparing to Code  47  Prerequisites Before we start modifying code to enhance the PWA News app, you must install some software  prerequisites you’ll use as you follow along. Who knows, you may already have them installed   you should . This setup is different from previous chapters, so please don’t skip ahead until  you’ve ensured that you have everything you need in place.  Node.js I built the PWA News site using Node.js and Express  a web framework for Node.js . It hosts the  static PWA News web site plus the application programming interface  API  used by the web  app. If your development workstation already has Node.js installed, then skip ahead to the next   section. If not, hop over to https:  nodejs.org and follow the instructions to install the client on  your development workstation.  To confirm that you have Node.js installed, open a new terminal window and execute the   following command:  node -v  If the terminal returns a version number  mine reports v10.16.0 , then Node.js is properly  installed. If you see an error message, then you have some work to do resolving the error before  continuing.  TypeScript With Node.js installed, now it’s time to install the TypeScript compiler. In the terminal window,  execute the following command:  npm install -g typescript  This installs the tsc command you’ll use many times through the remainder of the book to   compile the web server app TypeScript code into JavaScript.  Git Client I published the source code for the book in a GitHub repository at https:  github.com johnwargo  learning-pwa-code. The easiest way to get the code, and to update your local copy when I publish  changes, is through Git. If your development workstation already has Git installed, then you’re  good. If not, hop over to https:  git-scm.com and follow the instructions to install the client on  your development workstation.  To confirm that you have Git installed, open a new terminal window and execute the following  command:  git --version  If the terminal returns a version number  mine reports git version 2.22.0.windows.1 , then  Git is properly installed. If you see an error message, then you have some work to do resolving the  error before continuing.   48  Chapter 3  Service Workers  With Git installed, open a terminal window or command prompt, navigate to the folder where  you want to store the book’s code, and then execute the following command:  git clone https:  github.com johnwargo learning-pwa-code  Once the cloning process completes, navigate the terminal into the cloned project’s  \learning-pwa-code\chapter-03\ folder. This folder contains the PWA News server app,  and that’s where we’ll work.  While we’re here, we might as well install all the dependencies required by the app. In the   terminal window pointing to the project folder  \learning-pwa-code\chapter-03\ , execute  the following command:  npm install  This command uses the Node Package Manager  npm  to install Node.js modules used by the server.  Visual Studio Code I use Visual Studio Code as my primary code editor for most projects; this is not because I work for  Microsoft  I do , but because it’s a very capable editor, and the large catalog of available  extensions  enables me to configure the editor environment with some really cool capabilities to make coding  easier. If you haven’t tried it out yet, hop over to https:  code.visualstudio.com  and give it a try.  Navigating the App Source The folder structure for the PWA News app source is shown in Figure 3.3. The public folder shown  in the figure holds the web app files we’ll use in this chapter. The code you’re looking at is for a web  server app, and the public folder is where the web server looks for the static files it serves.  Figure 3.3  PWA News App Source Folder   Preparing to Code  49  I wrote server code  the APIs the web app uses  using TypeScript,6 a typed superset of JavaScript.  Using TypeScript allowed me to define types for all my app’s variables and more easily find errors   based on that typing . TypeScript code compiles to JavaScript using the TypeScript Compiler   tsc , so the .js files you see in the figure are compiled versions of my code located in the   project’s app folder.  If you decide you want to make changes to how the server and API work, you must make your  modifications in the app folder. Once you’re ready to apply your changes, open a terminal   window, navigate to the root project folder  the one shown in Figure 3.3 , and execute the   following command:  tsc  This compiles the server’s .ts files into the .js files you see in the root folder shown in the   figure. You’ll see some errors and warnings from the code’s references to some of the objects, but  the unmodified code runs as is, so look for errors from the code you modified.  Configuring the Server API The server process consumes the Bing News Search API from Microsoft Azure to collect the news  data displayed in the app. You’ll need an Azure account and a Bing API key to work with the code  in this chapter.  If you already have an Azure account, log in to your account at https:  portal.azure.com. If you  don’t have an account, create a free one at https:  azure.microsoft.com en-us free . Once you’ve  created the account, log in to the portal using your new account at https:  portal.azure.com.  To use the Bing Search API, you must first generate an API key for the service. The key is free,  and you can use up to 3,000 searches per month in the free tier. Point your browser of choice to  https:  portal.azure.com create Microsoft.CognitiveServicesBingSearch-v7 and log in. Populate  the form with the following information:   Name: Enter a name for the resource  use something such as Learning PWA, or PWA News .    Subscription: Select Pay-As-You-Go.   Location: Select an Azure Region from the drop-down. It doesn’t matter which one you   pick; I suggest you pick one near your current location  I selected East US .   Pricing Tier: Select the free tier.  RG-PWA or RG-PWA-News .   Resource Group: Create a new one, and give it any name you want  use something such as   Click the Create button when you’re done with the form.  6.  https:  www.typescriptlang.org    50  Chapter 3  Service Workers  Note Microsoft Azure offers a robust free tier you can use as you work through this chapter. The  free tier gives customers three transactions per second  up to 3,000 per month , so in your  testing of this app, you’re unlikely to exceed the free plan limits. To help even further, I coded  the server app to restrict how often it connects to Bing to get news articles. By default, it only  checks every 15  minutes, no matter how often a client hits the server API. If you do the math,  you’ll see there’s no way for the server to ever exceed that free limit.        When you get to the page shown in Figure 3.4, click the copy icon to the far right of either the  KEY 1 or KEY 2 field to copy the selected key to the clipboard. You’ll need one of these keys in the  next step.  Figure 3.4  Azure Portal  Next, in the project source code folder, open the project’s app congfig.ts file. This file exports  a single property, the BING_ACCESS_KEY shown in Listing 3.1. Paste the key you just copied to the  clipboard between the empty quotes in the file.  Listing 3.1  PWA News app config.ts File  export const config = {      enter your private Bing Search API access key   BING_ACCESS_KEY: '' };   Preparing to Code  51  For example, you’ll change  BING_ACCESS_KEY: ''  to something like this:  BING_ACCESS_KEY: 'your-super-secret-api-key'  Save the file, then open a terminal window, navigate to the root project folder  the one shown in  Figure 3.3 , and execute the following command:  tsc  This step invokes the TypeScript compiler to compile the config.ts file into a new config.js  file in the project root folder  not shown in Figure 3.3 . With this in place, you’re all set to start  the server process and begin interacting with the app.  You’ll need this same config.js file as you work through the code in subsequent chapters, so  I included a batch file and shell script to automate copying the compiled file to the other project  folders. If your development system runs Windows, in the terminal window pointing to  \learning-pwa-code\chapter-03\, execute the following command:  If your development system runs macOS, in the terminal window pointing to  \learning-pwa-code\chapter-03\, execute the following command:  copy-config.cmd  . copy-config.sh  At the end of either process, you should see the config.js file copied into the root project folder  for each chapter folder that uses the PWA News app.  Starting the Server With all the parts in place, it’s time to start the server. If you don’t have a terminal window open point- ing to the project folder, open one now, and navigate to the \learning-pwa-code\chapter-03\  folder. Once there, execute the following command:  npm start  If everything’s set up properly in the code, the server will respond with the following text in the  terminal:  pwa-news-server@0.0.1 start D:\learning-pwa-code\chapter-03 node . bin www  At this point, you’re all set—the server is up and running and ready to serve content. If you see an  error message, you must dig through any reported errors and resolve them before continuing.  To see the web app in its current state, open Google Chrome or one of the browsers that supports  service workers and navigate to  http:  localhost:3000   52  Chapter 3  Service Workers  After a short delay, the server should render the app as shown in Figure 3.1. When you look in  the terminal window, you should see the server process start, then log messages as it serves the   different parts of the app, as shown here:  > pwa-news-server@0.0.1 start D:\learning-pwa-code\chapter-03 > node . bin www   2019-07-29T22:27:25.054Z GET   304 8.365 ms - - 2019-07-29T22:27:25.075Z GET  css custom.css 304 2.004 ms - - 2019-07-29T22:27:25.079Z GET  img bing-logo.png 304 0.935 ms - - 2019-07-29T22:27:25.104Z GET  js sw-reg.js 304 0.746 ms - - 2019-07-29T22:27:25.114Z GET  js utils.js 304 0.756 ms - - 2019-07-29T22:27:25.115Z GET  js index.js 304 0.731 ms - - Router: GET  api news 2019-07-29T22:27:26.376Z GET  sw-34.js 404 1132.392 ms - 565 2019-07-29T22:27:26.381Z GET  app.webmanifest 304 1.766 ms - - 2019-07-29T22:27:26.420Z GET  icons android-icon-192x192.png 404 20.681 ms - 565 Returning result  1  2019-07-29T22:27:26.788Z GET  api news 200 1645.317 ms - 12222  The server hosts the app at port 3000 by default  the port number is the numeric value after the  last colon in the example , but if your system has another process listening on that port, then it’s  not going to work. To change the port number used by the app, open the project’s bin www file  and look for the following line:  var port = normalizePort process.env.PORT  '3000' ;  Change the '3000' to another port  hopefully an available one , save your changes, then restart  the server and access the site at the new port. You can also set the port using local environment  variables7 if you want.  Registering a Service Worker Web apps follow a specific process to install a service worker; there’s no automatic way to do it  today. The app basically executes some JavaScript code to register the service worker with the  browser. In the Tip Calculator app in Chapter 1, “Introducing Progressive Web Apps,” I added the  code to do this directly in the app’s index.html file. For the PWA News app, we use a different  approach.  In this section, you’ll modify the project’s existing public index.html file plus add two  JavaScript files: public js sw-reg.js and public sw.js.  In the   section of the project’s public index.html file, add the following code:        7.  https:  stackoverflow.com questions 18008620 node-js-express-js-app-only-works-on-port-3000   Registering a Service Worker  53  This tells the web app to load a JavaScript file that registers the service worker for us. Next, let’s  create that file. Create a new file called public js sw-reg.js and populate the file with the  code shown in Listing 3.2.  Listing 3.2  PWA News sw-reg.js File     does the browser support service workers? if  'serviceWorker' in navigator  {      then register our service worker   navigator.serviceWorker.register ' sw.js'      .then reg => {          display a success message       console.log `Service Worker Registration  Scope: ${reg.scope} ` ;     }      .catch error => {          display an error message       let msg = `Service Worker Error  ${error} `;       console.error msg ;          display a warning dialog  using Sweet Alert 2        Swal.fire '', msg, 'error' ;     } ; } else {      happens when the app isn't served over a TLS connection  HTTPS       or if the browser doesn't support service workers   console.warn 'Service Worker not available' ; }  The code here isn’t very complicated; it all centers around the call to  navigator.serviceWorker.register. The code first checks to see if the serviceWorker  object exists in the browser’s  navigator object. If it does, then this browser supports service  workers. After the code verifies it can register the service worker, it does so through the call to  navigator.serviceWorker.register.  The register method returns a promise, so the code includes then and catch methods to  act depending on whether the installation succeeded or failed. If it succeeds, it tosses a simple   message out to the console. If the call to register fails  caught with the catch method , we  warn the user with an alert dialog.  Two potential error conditions exist here: if the browser doesn’t support service workers and if  service worker registration fails. When the browser doesn’t support service workers, I log a simple  warning to the console  using console.warn . I don’t do anything special to warn the user because  this is progressive enhancement, right? If the browser doesn’t support service workers, the user just  continues to use the app as is, with no special capabilities provided through service workers.  On the other hand, if registration fails, then the code is broken  because we already know the  browser supports service workers , and I want to let you know more obnoxiously with an alert  dialog. I did this because you’re learning how this works, and I wanted the error condition to be  easily recognized. I probably wouldn’t do this for production apps because if the service worker  doesn’t register, the app simply falls back to the normal mode of operation.   54  Chapter 3  Service Workers  Service workers don’t start working until the next page loads anyway, so to keep things clean, you  can defer registering the service worker until the app finishes loading, as shown in Listing 3.3.  Listing 3.3  PWA News sw-reg.js File  Alternate Version      does the browser support service workers? if  'serviceWorker' in navigator  {      Defer service worker installation until the page completes loading   window.addEventListener 'load',    => {        then register our service worker     navigator.serviceWorker.register ' sw.js'        .then reg => {            display a success message         console.log `Service Worker Registration  Scope: ${reg.scope} ` ;       }        .catch error  => {            display an error message         let msg = `Service Worker Error  ${error} `;         console.error msg ;            display a warning dialog  using Sweet Alert 2          Swal.fire '', msg, 'error' ;       } ;   }  } else {        happens when the app isn't served over a TLS connection  HTTPS         or if the browser doesn't support service workers     console.warn 'Service Worker not available' ; }  In this example, the code adds an event listener for the load event and starts service worker reg- istration after that event fires. All this does is defer the additional work until the app is done with  all its other startup stuff and shouldn’t even be noticeable to the user.  Next, let’s create a service worker. Create a new file called public sw.js and populate it with the  code shown in Listing 3.4. Notice that we created the service worker registration file in the proj- ect’s public js  folder, but this one goes into the web app’s root folder  public  ; I’ll explain  why in “Service Worker Scope” later in this chapter—I’m just mentioning it now to save you a  potential problem later if you put it in the wrong place.  Listing 3.4  First Service Worker Example: sw-34.js   self.addEventListener 'fetch', event => {      fires whenever the app requests a resource  file or data    console.log `SW: Fetching ${event.request.url}` ; } ;  Note To save you typing in all the service worker example code, I’ve placed each service worker  example, named using the listing number, in a folder called public service-workers. You  can see the file name in the listing heading above: sw-34.js for Listing 3.4.         Registering a Service Worker  55  This code is simple as well. All it does is create an event listener for the browser’s fetch event,  then logs the requested resource to the console. The fetch event fires whenever the browser, or  an app running in the browser, requests an external resource  such as a file or data . This is differ- ent from the JavaScript fetch method, which enables an app’s JavaScript code to request data or  resources from the network. The browser requesting resources  such as a JavaScript or image file  referenced in an HTML script or img tag  and a web app’s JavaScript code requesting a resource  using the fetch method will both cause the fetch event to fire.  This is the core functionality of a service worker, intercepting fetch events and doing some- thing with the request—such as getting the requested resource from the network, pulling the  requested file from cache, or even sending something completely different to the app requesting  the resource. It’s all up to you: your service worker delivers as much or as little enhancement as  needed for your app.  With this file in place, refresh the app in the browser and watch what happens. Nothing, right?  There’s not much to see here since, everything happens under the covers. In this example, the  service worker does nothing except log the event; as you can see in the browser, the app loaded as  expected, so the app’s still working the same as it did before.  Open the browser’s developer tools and look for a tab labeled Application  or something similar   and a side tab labeled Service Workers. If you did everything right, you should see your service  worker properly registered in the browser, as shown in Figure 3.5  in Google Chrome .  Figure 3.5  Chrome Developer Tools Application Tab   56  Chapter 3  Service Workers  If the browser can’t register the service worker, it displays error messages in this panel to let  you know.  In the latest Chrome browser and the Chromium-based Edge browser, you can also open a  special  page that displays information about all service workers registered in the browser. Open the  browser and enter the following value in the address bar:  chrome:  serviceworker-internals   The browser opens the page shown in Figure 3.6, listing all registered service workers.  Figure 3.6  Chrome Service Worker Internals Page  The one thing missing from the service worker as it stands today is for it to actually do something  with the fetch request. Listing 3.5 adds an additional line of code to our existing service worker:  event.respondWith fetch event.request  ;  This code instructs the browser to go ahead and get the requested file from the network. Without  this statement in the event listener, the browser was doing this anyway. Since the event listener  didn’t act on the request and return a promise telling the browser it was dealing with it, then the  browser goes ahead and gets the file anyway. That’s why the app works without this line. Adding  the line just completes the event listener.   Registering a Service Worker  57  Listing 3.5  Second Service Worker Example: sw-35.js  self.addEventListener 'fetch', event => {      fires whenever the app requests a resource  file or data    console.log `SW: Fetching ${event.request.url}` ;      next, go get the requested resource from the network,       nothing fancy going on here.   event.respondWith fetch event.request  ; } ;  The browser passes the fetch event listener an event object service workers query to determine  which resource was requested. Service workers use this mechanism to determine whether to get  the resource from cache or request it from the network. I cover this in more detail later  in this  chapter and the next , but for now this extra line of code simply enforces what we’ve already seen  the browser do—get the requested resource from the network.  The browser fires two other events of interest to the service worker developer: install and   activate. Listing 3.6 shows a service worker with event listeners for both included.  Listing 3.6  Third Service Worker Example: sw-36.js  self.addEventListener 'install', event => {      fires when the browser installs the app      here we're just logging the event and the contents      of the object passed to the event. the purpose of this event      is to give the service worker a place to setup the local       environment after the installation completes.   console.log `SW: Event fired: ${event.type}` ;   console.dir event ; } ;   self.addEventListener 'activate', event => {      fires after the service worker completes its installation.      It's a place for the service worker to clean up from      previous service worker versions.   console.log `SW: Event fired: ${event.type}` ;   console.dir event ; } ;   self.addEventListener 'fetch', event => {      fires whenever the app requests a resource  file or data    console.log `SW: Fetching ${event.request.url}` ;      next, go get the requested resource from the network,      nothing fancy going on here.   event.respondWith fetch event.request  ; } ;   58  Chapter 3  Service Workers  The browser fires the install event when it completes installation of the service worker. The  event provides the app with an opportunity to do the setup work required by the service worker.  At this point, the service worker is installed but not yet operational  it doesn’t do anything yet .  The browser fires the activate event when the current service worker becomes the active service  worker for the app. A service worker works at the browser level, not the app level, so when the  browser installs it, it doesn’t become active until the app reloads in all browser tabs running the  app. Once it activates, it stays active for any browser tabs running the app until the browser closes  all tabs for the app or the browser restarts.  The activate event provides service workers with an opportunity to perform tasks when the  service worker becomes the active service worker. Usually, this means cleaning up any cached  data from a previous version of the app  or service worker . You’ll learn a lot more about this in  Chapter 4, “Resource Caching”; for now, let’s add this code to our existing service worker and see  what happens.  Once you’ve updated the code, reload the page in the browser, then open the developer tools  console panel and look for the output shown in Figure 3.7. Chances are, you won’t see it—that’s  because the previous version of the service worker is still active. You should see the install event  fire but not the activate event.  Figure 3.7  Chrome Browser Tools Console Pane with Installation Output   Registering a Service Worker  59  You have several options for activating this new service worker. I explain two here and cover   programmatic options in “The Service Worker Lifecycle” later in the chapter. One option is to  close and reopen the browser, then reload the app; this automatically enables the registered   service worker.  Another option is to configure the browser developer tools to automatically activate the new  service worker once it registers the service worker; this approach is useful only when debugging  or testing a PWA. At the top of the service workers pane shown in Figure 3.5 is a checkbox labeled  Update on reload; when you enable  check  this checkbox, the browser automatically updates  and activates new service workers every time you reload the page with a new service worker.  Force the browser to activate the new service worker, then look at the console page. You should  now see the output shown in Figure 3.8 with each network request logged to the console.  Figure 3.8  Chrome Browser Tools Console Pane with Service Worker Output  At this point, the app has a functioning service worker listening for all relevant events and   fetching all requested resources from the network. In the next sections, we talk about service  worker scope  as promised  and the service worker lifecycle; then I’ll show you more you can do  with service workers.   60  Chapter 3  Service Workers  Service Worker Scope Remember early on when I said that one of the requirements for PWAs was that the browser  accesses the app using a TLS  HTTPS  or localhost connection? This layer of security helps protect  apps from rogue agents loading a service worker from another location.  As another layer of security, the location of the service worker file matters. When an app registers  a service worker, by default the service worker can work only with resources hosted in the same  folder location and below; anything higher up in the folder structure is ignored.  If you remember the code that registers the app’s service worker  Listing 3.2 , when registration  completes successfully, the code executes the following line:  console.log `Service Worker Registration  Scope: ${reg.scope} ` ;  This lets the developer know that the service worker registered correctly, and it outputs the   contents of the reg object’s scope property:  Service Worker Registration  Scope: http:  localhost:3000    This scope defines the service worker’s operational domain, the part of the web app over which  the service worker has providence. In this example, the service worker scope begins at localhost  and covers anything available under that host.  If your app includes content and code in subfolders, for example, app1 and app2, and you want  to register a separate service worker for each, you can easily do that. One option is to place the  appropriate service worker in each folder; they automatically inherit scope from the folder where  the service worker code is hosted when you register the service worker.  Another option is to set the scope for the service worker during registration; as an example, look  at the following code:  navigator.serviceWorker.register ' sw1.js', {scope: ' app1 '}   This example registers the sw1.js service worker and sets the scope for the service worker to the  app1 folder. With this in place, this service worker will process fetch requests only for resources  located in the app1 folder and below  subfolders .  The Service Worker Lifecycle Each service worker cycles through multiple states from the moment the browser calls   navigator.serviceworker.register until it’s discarded or replaced by the browser. The  states defined in the service worker specification are   Installing   Waiting   Active   The Service Worker Lifecycle  61  When an app registers a service worker, the browser   Locates the service worker  requests it from a server    Downloads the service worker   Parses and executes the service worker  If the browser can’t download or execute the service worker, it discards the service worker  if it has  it  and informs the code that called navigator.serviceworker.register. In Listing 3.3, that  means that the catch clause executes and whatever code is there executes.  If the browser successfully downloads the service worker, it executes the service worker, and  that’s how the service worker registers the install and activate event listeners in the service  worker code.  At this point, the install event listener fires; that’s where a service worker creates its local cache  and performs any additional setup steps. A representation of the service worker  version 1  at the  Installing state is shown in Figure 3.9.  Figure 3.9  Service Worker 1 Installing  If a service worker isn’t currently registered, the service worker transitions to the Active state, and  it’s ready to process fetch requests the next time the app reloads, as shown in Figure 3.10.  Figure 3.10  Service Worker 1 Active  If the web app attempts to install a new version of the service worker  version 2, for example ,  then the process starts all over again for the new service worker. The browser downloads and   executes service worker v2, the v2 install event fires, and it completes its initial setup.  At this point, the app is still active and has an active service worker  v1  in play. Remember, the  current service worker remains active until you close the browser  or at least all tabs running  the web app  or the browser is configured to force reloading the service worker. With an existing   service worker active, service worker v2 goes into a waiting state, as shown in Figure 3.11.   62  Chapter 3  Service Workers  Figure 3.11  Two Service Workers in Play  Once the user closes all browser tabs running the app or restarts the browser, the browser discards  service worker v1 and sets service worker v2 to active as shown in Figure 3.12.  Figure 3.12  Service Worker V2 Active  When you update the service worker and a user navigates to the app, the browser attempts to  download the service worker again. If the newly downloaded service worker is as little as one  byte different from the one currently registered, the browser registers the new service worker and  the activation process kicks off again. Regardless of whether or not it has changed, the browser   downloads the service worker every time the page reloads.  Forcing Activation Earlier I described ways to force the browser to activate a service worker by reloading the page or  enabling the Reload option in the browser developer tools. Both of those options are great but  require some action by the user. To force the browser to activate a service worker programmati- cally, simply execute the following line of code somewhere in your service worker:     force service worker activation self.skipWaiting  ;  You’ll typically perform this action during the install event, as shown in Listing 3.7.  Listing 3.7  Fourth Service Worker Example: sw-37.js  self.addEventListener 'install', event => {      fires when the browser installs the app      here we're just logging the event and the contents      of the object passed to the event. the purpose of this event      is to give the service worker a place to setup the local       environment after the installation completes.   console.log `SW: Event fired: ${event.type}` ;   The Service Worker Lifecycle  63    console.dir event ;      force service worker activation   self.skipWaiting  ; } ;   self.addEventListener 'activate', event => {      fires after the service worker completes its installation.       It's a place for the service worker to clean up from previous       service worker versions   console.log `SW: Event fired: ${event.type}` ;   console.dir event ; } ;   self.addEventListener 'fetch', event => {      fires whenever the app requests a resource  file or data    console.log `SW: Fetching ${event.request.url}` ;      next, go get the requested resource from the network,       nothing fancy going on here.   event.respondWith fetch event.request  ; } ;  Claiming Additional Browser Tabs In some cases, users may have multiple instances of your app running in separate browser tabs.  When you register a new service worker, you can apply that new service worker across all relevant  tabs. To do this, in the service worker’s activate event listener, add the following code:     apply this service worker to all tabs running the app self.clients.claim    A complete listing for a service worker using this feature is provided in Listing 3.8.  Listing 3.8  Fifth Service Worker Example: sw-38.js  self.addEventListener 'install', event => {        fires when the browser installs the app        here we're just logging the event and the contents        of the object passed to the event. the purpose of this event        is to give the service worker a place to setup the local         environment after the installation completes.     console.log `SW: Event fired: ${event.type}` ;     console.dir event ;        force service worker activation     self.skipWaiting  ; } ;     64  Chapter 3  Service Workers  self.addEventListener 'activate', event => {        fires after the service worker completes its installation.         It's a place for the service worker to clean up from previous         service worker versions     console.log `SW: Event fired: ${event.type}` ;     console.dir event ;        apply this service worker to all tabs running the app     self.clients.claim   } ;   self.addEventListener 'fetch', event => {        fires whenever the app requests a resource  file or data      console.log `SW: Fetching ${event.request.url}` ;        next, go get the requested resource from the network,         nothing fancy going on here.     event.respondWith fetch event.request  ; } ;  Observing a Service Worker Change In the previous section, I showed how to claim service worker control over other browser tabs  running the same web app after a new service worker activation. In this case, you have at least two  browser tabs open running the same app, and in one tab a new version of the service worker was  just activated.  To enable the app running in the other tabs to recognize the activation of the new service worker,  add the following event listener to the bottom of the project’s sw.js file:  navigator.serviceWorker.addEventListener 'controllerchange',    => {   console.log "Hmmm, we’re operating under a new service worker" ; } ;  The service worker controllerchange event fires when the browser detects a new service worker  in play, and you’ll use this event listener to inform the user or force the current tab to reload.  Forcing a Service Worker Update In the world of single-page apps  SPAs , browsers load the framework of a web app once, and the  app then swaps in the variable content as often as needed while the user works. These apps don’t  get reloaded much because users simply don’t need to. This is kind of a stretch case, but if you’re  doing frequent development on the app or know you’re going to update your app’s service worker  frequently, the service worker’s registration object  reg in all the source code examples so far    provides a way to request an update check from the app’s code  To enable this, simply execute the following line of code periodically to check for updates:  reg.update  ;   The Service Worker Lifecycle  65  The trick is that you must maintain access to the registration object long enough that you can do  this. In Listing 3.9, I took the service worker registration code from Listing 3.2 and modified it a bit.  First, I created a variable called regObject, which the code uses to capture a pointer to the reg  object exposed by the call to navigator.serviceWorker.register. Next, I added some code  to the registration success case  the .then method  that stores a pointer to the reg object in  the regObject variable and sets up an interval timer for every 10 minutes. Finally, I added a  requestUpgrade function that triggers every 10 minutes to check for a service worker update.  Listing 3.9  Alternate Service Worker Registration: sw-reg2.js     define a variable to hold a reference to the    registration object  reg  var regObject;      does the browser support service workers? if  'serviceWorker' in navigator  {      then register our service worker   navigator.serviceWorker.register ' sw.js'      .then reg => {          display a success message       console.log `Service Worker Registration  Scope: ${reg.scope} ` ;          Store the `reg` object away for later use       regObject = reg;          setup the interval timer       setInterval requestUpgrade, 600000 ;      }      .catch error => {          display an error message       let msg = `Service Worker Error  ${error} `;       console.error msg ;          display a warning dialog  using Sweet Alert 2        Swal.fire 'Registration Error', msg, 'error' ;     } ; } else {      happens when the app isn't served over a TLS connection       HTTPS  or if the browser doesn't support service workers   console.warn 'Service Worker not available' ;      we're not going to use an alert dialog here       because if it doesn't work, it doesn't work;      this doesn't change the behavior of the app      for the user }   function requestUpgrade  {   console.log 'Requesting an upgrade' ;   regObject.update  ; }   66  Chapter 3  Service Workers  You could even trigger execution of this code through a push notification if you wanted to force  the update only when you publish updates by sending a special notification message whenever  you publish a new version of the service worker.  Service Worker ready Promise There’s one final service worker lifecycle topic I haven’t covered yet. The serviceWorker object  has a read-only ready property that returns a promise that never rejects and sits there waiting  patiently until the service worker registration is active. This gives your service worker registration  code a place to do things when a page loads with an active service worker.  We already have the install and activate events, both of which get involved during service  worker registration and replacement. If your app wants to execute code only when a service  worker is active, use the following:  if  'serviceWorker' in navigator  {   navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then  reg  => {        we have an active service worker working for us     console.log `Service Worker ready  Scope: ${reg.scope} ` ;        do something interesting...     } ;   } else {      happens when the app isn't served over a TLS connection  HTTPS    console.warn 'Service Worker not available' ; }  You’ll see an example of this in action in Chapter 6.  Wrap-Up In this chapter, we covered a lot about service workers and have one running in our app. You  learned all about the service worker lifecycle and the special events and methods the service  worker provides developers.  Unfortunately, the service worker we have doesn’t do much. In the next chapter, we’ll expand the  capabilities of the service worker and explore many ways to manage caching the resources used by  the app.   4 Resource Caching  In Chapter 3, “Service Workers,” we added a service worker to a web app and learned all about the  service worker lifecycle. The service worker didn’t do much of anything, but at least we got one  working in the app. In this chapter, we cover many of the ways you can cache web app content  using a service worker.  Web apps use a cache for two reasons: to speed up app loading and so the app, or parts of the app,  function when the system running the app does not have network connectivity. Launching a web  app using cached resources is one of the things that makes Progressive Web Apps  PWAs  perform  more like native mobile apps. When the app UI appears quickly, users don’t mind too much if it  takes a little longer to populate the page with data, whereas users get frustrated when it takes a  long time to load the app UI and then even longer to load its data.  The caching strategy you pick depends on the nature of the web app you’re writing and how  much of it you want available when the browser running the app is offline.  Service Worker Cache Interface One of the core capabilities enabling service workers is the browser’s Cache Interface.1 This cache  provides service workers with a built-in way to cache resources used by a web app. The cache is  a local repository of request response pairs; the request is an object representing the resource  request from the web app, and the response is an object representing the response from the server  for that specific resource.  With a properly populated cache, a service worker can respond to resource requests from the  cache and the app doesn’t know any better; as far as the app is concerned, those resources came  directly from the web server. The cache doesn’t just cache the resource files  for example, .css,  .html, or .js files , it caches the full server response for the requested resource  which includes  headers, other stuff, plus the actual requested file .  1.  https:  developer.mozilla.org en-US docs Web API Cache   68  Chapter 4  Resource Caching              Note The cache is an interface included with a browser’s support for service workers, but you can  use the cache outside of a service worker if you need for other parts of your application.  JavaScript and Promises One of the things we haven’t spent any time discussing is modern JavaScript development  approaches and promises.2 Stuffy old JavaScript used callbacks to enable asynchronous  operation: when an app called an asynchronous function or method  which took some time  to complete , the app passed in a function it wanted executed when the time-consuming pro- cess completed. When you had asynchronous tasks calling other asynchronous tasks, things  became quite messy. This created a situation commonly known as callback hell3 and created  some very hard-to-read JavaScript code. Recent work by the JavaScript community introduced the concept of promises, a construct  that fixes much of this problem. The reason JavaScript promises is important is that service  workers and their associated cache mechanisms make heavy use of promises. In previous  chapters, any function or method we called that used promises were easily handled by the  .then and .catch methods tacked on to the end of the function or method call. In this chapter, we dig into topics that make much heavier use of promises, so you’re going to  have to be up to speed on how they work. This book isn’t about promises, and there are a lot  of great resources online that cover the topic better than I can. So, if you’re not familiar and  comfortable working with promises, why don’t you put the book down for a little while and do  some external reading on promises before picking this back up again?  The Cache interface exposes the following methods:   add—Retrieves the requested resource from the network and adds the request  and   associated response  to the cache.   addAll—For an array of request objects, retrieves the requested resource represented by   each object in the array and adds each result to the cache.   delete—Deletes the specified request entry from the cache.   keys—Returns a promise that resolves to an array of keys from the cache; keys in this case   are request objects.   match—Returns a promise that resolves to the response for the first matching request in  the cache. Basically, the app passes in a request object, and this method returns the first  matching response from the cache.   matchAll—Returns a promise that resolves to an array of all request responses matching   the specified request in the cache.   put—Adds a request response object pair to the cache.  We use most of these methods throughout the remainder of this chapter.  2.  https:  developers.google.com web fundamentals primers promises 3.  http:  callbackhell.com    Preparing to Code  69  Preparing to Code The work we do in this chapter revolves around the code for the server app available in the book’s  GitHub repository at https:  github.com johnwargo learning-pwa-code. I provided complete  instructions for how to download the code and configure your development environment in the  section “Preparing to Code” in Chapter 3. If you haven’t already completed those steps, go there  and complete them first before picking up here again.  Note I’m writing most of this book on Windows  not because I work for Microsoft but because that’s  my primary development system . Consequently, all the file path examples in this chapter and  beyond use the backslash  \  character as a path delimiter. If you’re following these examples  on a system running Linux or macOS, please just replace the backslash characters in the folder  path examples with forward slashes    , and everything will be OK.       Open a terminal window and navigate the terminal into the cloned project’s  \learning-pwa-code\chapter-04\ folder. This folder contains the Chapter 4 version of the  PWA News server app  which has all the code changes you were supposed to make in Chapter 3 .  Install all the dependencies required by the app by executing the following command:  This command uses the Node Package Manager  npm  to install Node.js modules used by the  server.  If you ran the copy-config command during the setup process in Chapter 3, you’re good—skip  ahead to running the npm command after the next paragraph. If not, copy the config.ts file  from \learning-pwa-code\chapter-03\app\ to \learning-pwa-code\chapter-04\app\.  This copies the configuration file holding the Bing API key you used in Chapter 3. With the file  copied, execute the following command:  This compiles the server’s .ts files  including the copied config.ts file  into the .js files you  see in the project root folder. You’ll see some errors and warnings from the code’s references to  some of the objects in the code, but you should be OK if it all worked in Chapter 3.  With all the parts in place, it’s time to start the server; in the terminal window, execute the  following command:  npm install  tsc  npm start  If everything’s set up properly in the code, the server will respond with the following text in the  terminal:  pwa-news-server@0.0.1 start D:\learning-pwa-code\chapter-04 node . bin www  At this point, you’re all set—the server is up and running and ready to serve content. If you see an  error message, you must dig through any reported errors and resolve them before continuing.   70  Chapter 4  Resource Caching  To see the web app in its current state, open Google Chrome or a browser that supports service  workers and navigate to  http:  localhost:3000  After a short delay, the server should render the app as shown in Figure 3.1.  Tip In this chapter, we’re making a lot of changes to a node-based server app while the server  runs.  Rather than forcing you to kill the server and restart it every time you make changes, you can  use nodemon4 to automatically restart the node server process whenever you make changes to  the server’s web app. To use the module, follow the installation instructions on the module’s home page, then use it  to start the server by executing the following command:  nodemon node bin www     instead of the npm start command described earlier.     Caching Application Resources One option for enabling app resource caching in a PWA is to preload the app with all the  resources the app needs to launch. In the case of the PWA News app, it means caching the app UI  and other required parts, then letting the app’s code reach out to the server to get the latest data  once the UI completes loading.  To do this, you can use a simple array like the following:  var urlList = [   ' ',   ' app.webmanifest',   ' index.html',   ' css custom.css',   ' img bing-logo.png',   ' js index.js',   ' js sw-reg.js',   ' js utils.js' ];  In this example, I built the array from the files I knew I had to have to render the app’s home page  in the browser. The first entry in the array is probably a surprise. When I tested this app against  my local server, as you soon will, I found the server accepts either   or  index.html to load the  app, so I had to accommodate both options in the cache.  4.  https:  www.npmjs.com package nodemon   Caching Application Resources  71  You don’t need the app.manifest file either, since it doesn’t matter when the app is already  installed. I added it here to avoid the error the index.html file generates when loading the app  offline and it tries to load the manifest.  Let’s add this to the service worker and use it to cache some data. Open the project’s service  worker file  sw.js  located in \learning-pwa-code\chapter-04\public\sw.js. Copy the  urlList array code from the previous example to the top of the file.  Next, update the install event listener to cache the web resources during service worker installation.  Copy or type the following code to replace the existing install event in the sw.js file:  self.addEventListener 'install', event => {   console.log `SW: ${event.type} event fired` ;      the service worker is installing, so it's our chance      to set up the app. In this case, we're telling      the browser to wait until we've populated the cache      before considering this service worker installed   event.waitUntil         create a local cache for our app resources     caches.open 'pwa-learn-cache'           Once it's open...       .then cache => {         console.log 'SW: Cache opened' ;            cache all the resources from the array         return cache.addAll urlList ;       }        .catch error => {         console.error error ;       }     ; } ;  What this code does is use the service worker event object’s waitUntil method to instruct the  browser to hold off completing the service worker installation process until the code in the paren- theses completes. The method expects a promise, so internally it doesn’t do anything until the  promise resolves.  The code opens the cache, but other interesting stuff happens inside as well:   The call to caches.open opens the pwa-learn-cache cache and returns a promise   When the cache opens, the .then method of caches.open calls the cache’s addAll   method, which returns a promise   The cache’s addAll method uses the urlList array to request all the resources needed by  the app. Given an array of URLs, addAll retrieves each target URL and adds the resulting  response object for each to the cache. Our array doesn’t look like an array of URLs, but from  the scope of the running web app, it is.  At the end of all this code, the app has a new cache populated with the response objects for each  element in the urlList array.   72  Chapter 4  Resource Caching  This code is just the first example of why I mentioned in the sidebar that you must understand  promises to work with service workers and caches. The code is a lot less complicated than it would  be with callbacks, but there’s still a lot going on. Keeping your code’s .then methods with the  right promise or making sure you’re returning a promise when you should will save you some  troubleshooting time later.  Finally, update the fetch event listener so it looks to the cache first before reverting to the  network for requested resources. Copy or type the following code to replace the existing fetch  event in the project’s sw.js file:  self.addEventListener 'fetch', event => {   console.log `SW: ${event.type} ${event.request.url}` ;      fires whenever the app requests a resource  file or data    event.respondWith         check to see if it's in the cache     caches.match event.request        .then response => {            if it is, then return the cached response            object from the cache         if  response  {           console.log `SW: Return Cache ${event.request.url}` ;           return response;         }            otherwise, tell the browser to go get the            resource from the network         console.log `SW: Return Network ${event.request.url}` ;         return fetch event.request ;       }     ; } ;  In this event listener, the code responds to the request with a promise; in this case, it is the prom- ise from the call to caches.match. The match method returns a promise that should resolve to  a fetch response. If the call to match finds the request, the code returns the response object  from the cached request  essentially the result of the same request processed during the install  event .  If the requested resource is not in the cache, the code returns a promise from the call to fetch  to get the requested resource from the network. When the fetch completes, the code returns the  result of the fetch  a response object containing the requested resource or an error  to the browser  for processing.  Listing 4.1 shows the complete listing for this version of the service worker. The file is in the  project’s \learning-pwa-code\chapter-04\public\service-workers folder along with any  other service worker files we create in this chapter.   Caching Application Resources  73  Listing 4.1  First Service Worker Example: sw-41.js  var urlList = [   ' ',   ' app.webmanifest',   ' index.html',   ' css custom.css',   ' img bing-logo.png',   ' js index.js',   ' js sw-reg.js',   ' js utils.js', ];   self.addEventListener 'install', event => {   console.log `SW: ${event.type} event fired` ;      the service worker is installing, so it's our chance      to setup the app. In this case, we're telling      the browser to wait until we've populated the cache      before considering this service worker installed   event.waitUntil         create a local cache for our app resources     caches.open 'pwa-learn-cache'           once it's open...       .then cache => {         console.log 'SW: Cache opened' ;            cache all of resources from the array         return cache.addAll urlList ;       }        .catch error => {         console.error error ;       }     ; } ;   self.addEventListener 'activate', event => {      fires after the service worker completes its       installation. It's a place for the service worker      to clean up from previous service worker versions   console.log `SW: ${event.type} event fired` ; } ;   self.addEventListener 'fetch', event => {   console.log `SW: ${event.type} ${event.request.url}` ;      fires whenever the app requests a resource  file or data    event.respondWith         check to see if it's in the cache     caches.match event.request        .then response => {            if it is, then return the cached response   74  Chapter 4  Resource Caching             object from the cache         if  response  {           console.log `SW: Return Cache ${event.request.url}` ;           return response;         }            otherwise, tell the browser to go get the            resource from the network         console.log `SW: Return Network ${event.request.url}` ;         return fetch event.request ;       }     ; } ;  If you launched the app after you started the server, you have an existing service worker active for  the app. Unregister the current service worker, as shown in Figure 3.5, then reload the app in the  browser. When you open the developer tools pane and switch to the Console tab, you’ll see that  the cache opened, as shown in Figure 4.1.  Figure 4.1  Chrome Developer Tools—Service Worker Cache Opened   Caching Application Resources  75  The service worker doesn’t activate until you reload the app again, so do that now and look at the  output. You should see the service worker grabbing files from the cache or the network, depend- ing on the resource, as shown in Figure 4.2.  Figure 4.2  Chrome Developer Tools—Service Worker Activated  Now, if you navigate to the Developer Tools Cache Storage tab, shown in Figure 4.3, you’ll see  the cache we created as well as the contents of the cache. As you work with different caching strat- egies and test out your apps, you can use this tool to view cached resources, delete the cache, and  even delete individual cached resources.  Figure 4.3  Chrome Developer Tools—Cache Storage  Earlier, I mentioned that many cache methods return response objects instead of just the cached  resource  such as an HTML, a CSS, or a JavaScript file . Each column shown in the figure maps to  the individual properties of the response object.   76  Chapter 4  Resource Caching  Let’s take the app offline and see how the code works; there are three ways to do this:   Stop the server by pressing Ctrl-C in the terminal window.   Enable the Offline checkbox in the browser, as shown in the top-left corner of the   Developer Tools Service Workers panel highlighted in Figure 4.4.   Change the network status from Online to Offline in the Developer Tools Network pane   highlighted in Figure 4.5.  Figure 4.4  Chrome Developer Tools—Service Workers Panel  Figure 4.5  Chrome Developer Tools—Network Panel  Take the browser offline, then reload the page. When you look at the console output, you should  see many of the app’s resources loaded from cache and network errors for a bunch of other  resources. That’s good, that’s what we expected.  Next, look at the page; it should appear as expected except that there’s no data from Bing dis- played. All you see is an error message, but we can probably do better than that. When you try    Caching Application Resources  77  to load the app’s About and Feedback pages, you get the browser’s default “Can’t find that page”  error message. We can do better there too. I’ll show you how to fix those issues, but only after  I show you first how to manage an app’s caches.  Offline Awareness When Scott and I created the PWA News site, I knew we’d take the app online and offline as we  tested different caching strategies, so I wanted to show in the app whether the app was online  or offline—to make it as easy as possible for you to tell. The good news is that the browser  makes this easy to implement. If you look in the project’s \public\js\utils.js file, you’ll find the following:     register event listener for both online and offline events     so we can make sure the UI updates accordingly and it always     understands the current state  console.log 'Registering Network Status event listeners' ;  window.addEventListener "offline", setNetworkStatus ;  window.addEventListener "online", setNetworkStatus ;  function setNetworkStatus   {         what's our network status?      let netStatus =  navigator.onLine  ? ONLINE_STR : OFFLINE_STR;         tell the developer  just for fun       console.log `Network status: ${netStatus}` ;         get a handle to the page body, offline status is page body           wide, just in case      let body = document.querySelector 'body' ;         remove the online class  if it's there       body.classList.remove ONLINE_STR.toLowerCase   ;         remove the offline class  if it's there       body.classList.remove OFFLINE_STR.toLowerCase   ;         set the presence value  text       document.getElementById 'presenceValue' .textContent = netStatus;         add the status class to the object      body.classList.add netStatus.toLowerCase   ;           }  The PWA News app registers event listeners for both the online and offline states, then  updates content in the footer whenever the app enters either state. This is something you can  easily add to your PWAs to let app users know in which mode the app is operating.       78  Chapter 4  Resource Caching  Cache Management We updated our service worker so it caches the main resources the app uses, but what do you  do when you update your app? How do you get the new versions of the app’s resources into the  cache? In this section, we discuss strategies for managing your local cache before we get back into  caching strategies in the sections that follow.  The first question we must answer as we address the issue of cache management is, How can the  app recognize that there’s a new version of the web app? In Chapter 2, “Web App Manifest Files,”  I mentioned that the browser downloads the service worker every time you reload the app and  checks to make sure it is the same as the one currently installed in the browser. If it’s different  if  it changes by at least one byte , the browser parses the service worker, executes it, and completes  the installation and activation process for the downloaded service worker. This process gives us a  useful option: at the top of the service worker file, add a simple variable or constant like this:     service worker version number const SW_VERSION = 1;  This constant defines a simple service worker version identifier, and when you publish a new ver- sion of the app, you simply increment this value. With that in place, the browser detects the new  service worker version, installs the updated service worker, and rebuilds the cache with the new  resources for the app.  Note The browser doesn’t detect the service worker version change because it reads that variable.  It detects the service worker version change because it does a byte comparison between the  active service worker and the one loaded by the app. If they’re different, the browser knows  there’s a new version to register. You could just as easily toggle the constant between two  values every time you update your service worker to get the same result.        What if the new app version uses different file names for app resources? What do you do now?  Well, one option is to simply cache the new resources and ignore the old ones using the code we  already have in place in Listing 4.1. The problem with that approach is that you’ll be caching data  you’ll never need again, and that’s wasteful  especially on mobile devices .  Thinking out loud here for a while  no changes for you to make to the app , you could delete the  cache using something like the following:  caches.delete 'pwa-learn-cache' .then    => {   console.log 'SW: Cache deleted' ;      do something else here...   } ;  From the service worker lifecycle, we know that the current service worker is active and still using  this cache. If we delete the cache under the current service worker, who knows what would hap- pen  probably something bad . No, there must be a better way.   Caching Application Resources  79  You could extend the earlier example to something like this:     service worker version number const SW_VERSION = 1;    generates a custom cache name per service worker version const CACHE_NAME = `pwa-learn-cache-v${SW-VERSION}`;  This generates a custom name for each app cache version: pwa-learn-cache-v1, pwa-learn-cache- v2, pwa-learn-cache-v3, and so on. Every time the swVersion value changes, the code generates  a new cacheName and therefore a new cache. This requires a small change to the service worker’s  install event handler, replacing the original version’s  caches.open 'pwa-learn-cache'   with  caches.open CACHE_NAME   Here’s the complete listing for the new event handler:  self.addEventListener 'install', event => {   console.log `SW: ${event.type} event fired` ;   event.waitUntil         create a local cache for our app resources     caches.open CACHE_NAME           once it's open...       .then cache => {         console.log 'SW: Cache opened' ;            cache all of resources from the array         return cache.addAll urlList ;       }        .catch error => {         console.error error ;       }     ; } ;  Well, this gets us part way there. We’ve created and populated a new cache for this new service  worker version, but we left behind the previous cache. This would work, but we’re still leaving  around cached files we’ll never use again. Users would never notice, but it would bother me.  OK, so what do we do? Well, the service worker activate event fires after the service worker  installs and just as the service worker becomes the active service worker. At this point, the pre- vious service worker is no longer active, so this seems like a perfect place for us to clean up the  earlier cache. The following code shows an updated service worker activate event that deletes all  caches that don’t match the name of the current service worker’s cache:  self.addEventListener 'activate', event => {      fires after the service worker completes its installation.      it's a place for the service worker to clean up from       previous service worker versions   console.log `SW: ${event.type} event fired` ;   80  Chapter 4  Resource Caching       don't complete the activation until all the code runs   event.waitUntil         get the list of cache keys  cache names      caches.keys  .then cacheList => {          don't stop until all complete       return Promise.all          cacheList.map theCache => {              is the cache key different than the              current cache name?           if  CACHE_NAME !== theCache   {                if yes, then delete it.              return caches.delete theCache ;           }         }         ;     }     ; } ;  The problem with this code is that it whacks all caches except for the current one used by the  service worker. That’s fine if the app has only one cache, but if the app opened other caches, this  process would delete all caches except for the only one the service worker cares about.  In the following example, I added a CACHE_ROOT constant the service worker uses to build the  cache name. We can use this to identify all versions of the service worker cache separately from all  others:     service worker version number const SW_VERSION = 1;    the root name for our cache const CACHE_ROOT = 'pwa-learn-cache'    generates a custom cache name per service worker version const CACHE_NAME = `${CACHE_ROOT}-v${SW_VERSION}`;  All it requires is a slight change to the if statement buried deep within the activate event  listener:  if   CACHE_NAME !== theCache  &&  theCache.startsWith CACHE_ROOT    {  Here’s the complete listing for the event listener:  self.addEventListener 'activate', event => {      fires after the service worker completes its installation.       it's a place for the service worker to clean up from previous       service worker versions   console.log `SW: ${event.type} event fired` ;      don't complete the activation until all the code runs   event.waitUntil         get the list of cache keys  cache names      caches.keys  .then cacheList => {          don't stop until all complete       return Promise.all    Caching Application Resources  81          cacheList.map theCache => {              is the cache key different than the               current cache name and has the same root?           if   CACHE_NAME !== theCache  &&  theCache.startsWith CACHE_ROOT    {                if yes, then delete it.              console.log `SW: deleting cache ${theCache}` ;             return caches.delete theCache ;           }         }         ;     }     ; } ;  With this in place, the service worker creates a new cache during the install event and whacks  all its older caches during the activate event, leaving other caches alone.  Listing 4.2 shows the complete code listing for this updated service worker. Take a moment to  update the app’s service worker with the code shown in Listing 4.2 and check it out. Make sure  to check the contents of the local cache in the browser’s Developer Tools  refer to Figure 4.3  to  validate correct operation.  Listing 4.2  Second Service Worker Example: sw-42.js     service worker version number const SW_VERSION = 1;    the root name for our cache const CACHE_ROOT = 'pwa-learn-cache';    generates a custom cache name per service worker version const CACHE_NAME = `${CACHE_ROOT}-v${SW_VERSION}`;   var urlList = [   ' ',   ' app.webmanifest',   ' index.html',   ' css custom.css',   ' img bing-logo.png',   ' js index.js',   ' js sw-reg.js',   ' js utils.js', ];   self.addEventListener 'install', event => {   console.log `SW: ${event.type} event fired` ;      the service worker is installing, so it's our chance      to setup the app. In this case, we're telling      the browser to wait until we've populated the cache      before considering this service worker installed   event.waitUntil         create a local cache for our app resources     caches.open CACHE_NAME    82  Chapter 4  Resource Caching           once it's open...       .then cache => {         console.log 'SW: Cache opened' ;            cache all of resources from the array         return cache.addAll urlList ;       }        .catch error => {         console.error error ;       }     ; } ;   self.addEventListener 'activate', event => {      fires after the service worker completes its installation.       it's a place for the service worker to clean up from previous       service worker versions   console.log `SW: ${event.type} event fired` ;      don't complete the activation until all the code runs   event.waitUntil         get the list of cache keys  cache names      caches.keys  .then cacheList => {          don't stop until all complete       return Promise.all          cacheList.map theCache => {              is the cache key different than the               current cache name and has the same root?           if   CACHE_NAME !== theCache  &&               theCache.startsWith CACHE_ROOT    {                if yes, then delete it.              console.log `SW: deleting cache ${theCache}` ;             return caches.delete theCache ;           }         }         ;     }     ; } ;   self.addEventListener 'fetch', event => {   console.log `SW: ${event.type} ${event.request.url}` ;      fires whenever the app requests a resource  file or data    event.respondWith         check to see if it's in the cache     caches.match event.request        .then response => {            if it is, then return the cached response            object from the cache         if  response  {   Caching Application Resources  83            console.log `SW: Return Cache ${event.request.url}` ;           return response;         }            otherwise, tell the browser to go get the            resource from the network         console.log `SW: Return Network ${event.request.url}` ;         return fetch event.request        }     ; } ;  Return a Data Object on Error In the app’s current state, when the browser can’t fetch news data from the server, the page dis- plays the generic error highlighted above the footer in Figure 4.6. The app knows it received an  error retrieving the data, so it correctly updates the status in the bottom-right corner of the page,  but we can do better. Since we have a service worker working on our behalf, let’s let it manage  dealing with the fetch error.  Figure 4.6  PWA News Data Fetch Error  What we want to do is to make the service worker return an empty data set plus the error code  the app needs to update the footer. To do this, first add the following constant to the top of the  project’s public sw.js file:  const EMPTY_NEWS_OBJECT = {   "status": 3,   "lastUpdated": 0,   "items": [] };   84  Chapter 4  Resource Caching  What this does is create a generic results object the service worker serves up when it can’t fetch  the data live from the server. Next, update the fetch event listener so it deals differently with  data requests than with the other resources used by the app. Start by refactoring the existing  event listener so it looks like the following:  self.addEventListener 'fetch', event => {   console.log `SW: ${event.type} ${event.request.url}` ;      is the request for news data?    if  event.request.url == `${location.origin} api news`  {     console.log 'SW: Data request detected' ;     } else {        non-data request, so respond with fetch results     event.respondWith           check to see if it's in the cache       caches.match event.request          .then response => {              if it is, then return the cached response              object from the cache           if  response  {             console.log `SW: Return Cache ${event.request.url}` ;             return response;           }              otherwise, tell the browser to go get the              resource from the network           console.log `SW: Return Network ${event.request.url}` ;           return fetch event.request ;         }       ;   } } ;  The if clause checks to see whether the requested resource is the call to the server’s News API.  The else clause includes the original code from the initial event listener. If you load the app now,  it should work exactly as it did before, even when offline, as all we’ve really done is add a log item  for the special data case.  Now, in the event listener’s if clause, after the log item, copy in the following code:  event.respondWith       then see if you can get the data   fetch event.request         oops, error, can't complete the fetch     .catch    => {          return the empty news object       return new Response JSON.stringify EMPTY_NEWS_OBJECT ,         { "status": 200, "statusText": "Dummy data!" } ;     }   ;   Caching Application Resources  85  The code tries to get the data from the server; if it can’t, the catch method kicks in and responds  with the empty news object we added at the top of the file. Now when you try to load the page  while offline, you’ll get the friendlier message already built into the app, as shown in Figure 4.7.  Figure 4.7  Delivering a Nicer Offline Error Message  Here’s the complete source code listing for the new event handler:  self.addEventListener 'fetch', event => {   console.log `SW: ${event.type} ${event.request.url}` ;      is the request for news data?    if  event.request.url == `${location.origin} api news`  {     console.log 'SW: Data request detected' ;     event.respondWith           then see if you can get the data       fetch event.request             oops, error, can't complete the fetch         .catch    => {              return the empty news object           return new Response JSON.stringify EMPTY_NEWS_OBJECT ,             { "status": 200, "statusText": "Dummy data!" } ;         }       ;   } else {        non-data request, so respond with fetch results     event.respondWith           check to see if it's in the cache   86  Chapter 4  Resource Caching        caches.match event.request          .then response => {              if it is, then return the cached response              object from the cache           if  response  {             console.log `SW: Return Cache ${event.request.url}` ;             return response;           }              otherwise, tell the browser to go get the              resource from the network           console.log `SW: Return Network ${event.request.url}` ;           return fetch event.request ;         }       ;   } } ;  You can easily tweak this code to deliver a different data object for each type of data request.  Note I’m not going to show this here, because I think it’s a silly example, but you could also use this  approach to tweak an app’s content or styling on the fly based on some condition in the app.  Using the online offline example from the earlier sidebar, you could code your service worker  so it delivers different CSS styling depending on whether the app is online or not. I bring this up because most books and articles start their coverage of this topic showing how  to return a flipped version of an image or setting a different background color for a page via  CSS on the fly, and I didn’t want you to wonder why I never mentioned these approaches. ☺        The complete service worker code for this example is in the project folder’s  public\service-workers\sw-43.js file.  Adding an Offline Page At the beginning of this chapter, I omitted the app’s other pages, About and Feedback, from the  list of cached resources. I did this not because I hate those pages but because I needed some pages  to not be available offline for this section of the chapter.  When you take the browser offline and try to load the About or Feedback page, you’ll see an error  page like the one shown in Figure 4.8. This isn’t the best experience for the user, as it’s a stark  change from the look and style of our app and doesn’t say much about what really happened. The  browser tries to explain some of the possible causes for the current error condition but fails rather  spectacularly.   Caching Application Resources  87  Figure 4.8  Browser Page Error  We, on the other hand, know a lot more about why the pages didn’t appear and can give the user  a better experience through service workers. There are a lot of different options for doing this,  ranging from simple to complex. I’ll highlight a few here and leave it up to you to figure out some  others.  One option is to use the approach taken in the previous section and return custom content when- ever a fetch request fails. Rather than return a data object as we did in the previous section, you  return text or HTML content.  Here’s an example of a fetch event listener that does just that:  self.addEventListener 'fetch', event => {   console.log `SW: ${event.type} ${event.request.url}` ;   event.respondWith         check to see if it's in the cache     caches.match event.request        .then response => {            if it is, then return the cached response            object from the cache         if  response  {           console.log `SW: Return Cache ${event.request.url}` ;           return response;         }            otherwise, tell the browser to go get the            resource from the network         console.log `SW: Return Network ${event.request.url}` ;         return fetch event.request          .catch    => {   88  Chapter 4  Resource Caching            return new Response "Hmmm, I can't seem to access that page." ;         }        }     ; } ;  In this case, when the fetch fails, the code creates a new Response object with the content and  returns it as the response for the fetch operation. When you try this in a browser in offline mode,  you get the page shown in Figure 4.9.  Figure 4.9  Custom Content in Response to an Error  Now, you can get fancy and return HTML in the response; the affected portion of the code would  look like this:  return fetch event.request    .catch    => {     return new Response        "   " +       " Access Error " +       " Hmmm, I can't seem to access that page. " +       "  ",       { headers: { "Content-Type": "text html" } }      ;   }   The code returns an HTML page to the browser, but the browser doesn’t recognize it as an HTML  page until you add the headers as a parameter when creating the response object. When you  load the page in an offline browser, you get a slightly better experience because the resulting page  has a formal heading and some styling around the body, as shown in Figure 4.10.  Figure 4.10  An HTML Response to an Error   Caching Application Resources  89  Now, you can spruce the content up with styling and other bells and whistles, but you’re still  generating HTML on the fly in your service worker, and that’s not efficient. Another issue is that  this is a rather brute-force approach, as it affects any requested resource even though the browser  is already quite capable of dealing with missing images, CSS files, and other stuff. What we need is  something that returns HTML only when the request says it can handle HTML, like this:  if  event.request.headers.get 'accept' .includes 'text html'   {      do something cool   }  Here’s a full implementation with the accepts check and generated HTML content:  return fetch event.request    .catch    => {     if  event.request.headers.get 'accept' .includes 'text html'   {       return new Response          "   " +         " Access Error " +         " Hmmm, I can't seem to access that page. " +         "  ",         { headers: { "Content-Type": "text html" } }        ;     }   }   This approach limits when the service worker responds with HTML, but we’re still sending gener- ated HTML. What we should do is send a custom HTML page that looks like the rest of our site.  We’ve already cached the site’s CSS file, so all we need to do is add the page we want returned  when the app is offline, or the browser can’t locate the page.  The app already has this offline page located at the project’s public\offline.html. Let’s add  the file to the cache using a slightly different approach. First, add the following line to the top of  the project’s sw.js file:  const OFFLINE_PAGE = ' offline.html';  This creates a reference to the offline file we’ll use when we serve it up when a resource can’t be  found. Next, update the urlList array by adding OFFLINE_PAGE as the last item in the array:  var urlList = [   ' ',   ' app.webmanifest',   ' index.html',   ' css custom.css',   ' img bing-logo.png',   ' js index.js',   ' js sw-reg.js',   ' js utils.js',   OFFLINE_PAGE ];   90  Chapter 4  Resource Caching  With this in place, the app knows about the offline file and will cache it during service worker  installation. Finally, in the fetch event listener, add the following code to the end of the event  listener when the service worker knows the resource isn’t in the cache:  return fetch event.request    .catch    => {     if  event.request.headers.get 'accept' .includes 'text html'   {       return caches.match OFFLINE_PAGE ;     }   }   At this point, the service worker has given up; it knows the requested resource isn’t in the cache,  and it tried to fetch it from the network and failed. All that’s left to do is serve up the offline file if  it happens to be in the cache. Here’s the complete event listener code:  self.addEventListener 'fetch', event => {   console.log `SW: ${event.type} ${event.request.url}` ;      is the request for news data?    if  event.request.url == `${location.origin} api news`  {     console.log 'SW: Data request detected' ;     event.respondWith           then see if you can get the data       fetch event.request             oops, error, can't complete the fetch         .catch    => {              return the empty news object           return new Response JSON.stringify EMPTY_NEWS_OBJECT ,             { "status": 200, "statusText": "Dummy data!" } ;         }       ;   } else {        non-data request, so respond with fetch results     event.respondWith           check to see if it's in the cache       caches.match event.request          .then response => {              if it is, then return the cached response              object from the cache           if  response  {             console.log `SW: Return Cache ${event.request.url}` ;             return response;           }              otherwise, tell the browser to go get the              resource from the network           console.log `SW: Return Network ${event.request.url}` ;           return fetch event.request              .catch    => {               if  event.request.headers.get 'accept'    Implementing Additional Caching Strategies  91                  .includes 'text html'   {                 return caches.match OFFLINE_PAGE ;               }             }          }       ;   } } ;  Bring the app back online, reload the page in the browser, then go offline again. When you try  to load the About page while the browser is offline, you get the much prettier page, shown in  Figure 4.11, which includes the app header, menu, and footer, just like the rest of the app’s pages.  This is a much better user experience, don’t you agree?  Figure 4.11  Serving an Offline Page from Cache  The complete service worker code for this example is in the project folder’s  public\service-workers\sw-44.js file.  Implementing Additional Caching Strategies Up to this point, we’ve built a powerful set of skills you can use to make your web apps more resil- ient to network issues. Our service worker example from the previous chapter delivered a service    92  Chapter 4  Resource Caching  worker that merely logged each request and then went to the network for the latest version of  every resource  no big deal . In this chapter so far, you’ve seen different variations on a service  worker caching strategy that caches resources just in case they’re not available from the network  but gets the latest from the network whenever possible. Where a resource can’t be dragged from the  network and isn’t in the cache, I’ve shown you several ways to soften the blow for your app users.  In this section, I expand coverage to include additional caching strategies you can use in your  PWAs. This will by no means be complete coverage of all possible options, but with these as a  base, you can probably cobble together any weird or obscure caching strategy you want for your  own apps. What you implement for your apps depends on the app and how frequently app  resources change.  For the following examples, I don’t expect you to update the app with the different caching strate- gies shown. You can if you want to, but the purpose of the remainder of the chapter is to simply  highlight other options for you to use.  Cache-Only For an installed PWA, especially simple apps such as the Tip Calculator from Chapter 2, the app  is entirely static; there’s no dynamic content in the app. You can easily build a URL array into the  service worker and use it to cache all app resources at startup, as I showed in an earlier example.  With that in place, the app works regardless of whether the browser has network connectivity.  In the PWA News app, only parts of the app rarely change. To enable the app to run even if the  device running the app doesn’t have network connectivity, you can update the urlList array  from our recent service worker examples to contain every possible static resource needed by the  app. With that in place, you can implement the cache-only approach highlighted in the follow- ing fetch event listener:  self.addEventListener 'fetch', event => {   console.log `SW: ${event.type} ${event.request.url}` ;      fires whenever the app requests a resource  file or data    event.respondWith         check to see if it's in the cache     caches.match event.request        .then function  response  {            if it is, then return the cached response            object from the cache         if  response  {           console.log `SW: Return Cache ${event.request.url}` ;           return response;         }       }     ; } ;  If the resource isn’t in the cache, the code does nothing; the service worker lets the browser deal  with its failure. In this case, the browser displays the generic resource-not-found error page shown  in Figure 3.8. You can add an offline file to the resource array, as shown in an earlier example,    Implementing Additional Caching Strategies  93  which is needed only if you forget to put a file in the resource array. The fetch event listener code  looks like the following:  self.addEventListener 'fetch', event => {   console.log `SW: ${event.type} ${event.request.url}` ;      fires whenever the app requests a resource  file or data    event.respondWith         check to see if it's in the cache     caches.match event.request        .then function  response  {            if it is, then return the cached response            object from the cache         if  response  {           console.log `SW: Return Cache ${event.request.url}` ;           return response;         }            otherwise check to see that the request accepts HTML         if  event.request.headers.get 'accept' .includes 'text html'   {              then return the offline page           console.log `SW: serving offline page ${OFFLINE_PAGE}` ;           return caches.match OFFLINE_PAGE ;         }       }     ; } ;  For this approach, I had to make sure every file the app needed to run was in the cache. What  caused me the most pain was figuring out that I also needed the service worker file even though it  was already installed. Remember, the browser requests the service worker file every time the page  loads, regardless of whether the service worker changed.  The complete service worker code for this example is in the project folder’s  public\service-workers\sw-45.js file.  Network First, Then Cache For many apps, especially ones that display dynamic data, you want the app to always pull con- tent from the network if possible, then fall back to the cache when the device running the app is  offline.  Like the cache-only example from the previous section, with this approach, you build the list of  static resources and use it to populate the cache at service worker activation. The service worker  attempts to pull requested resources from the network and serves them from the cache if the net- work version is not available.  For dynamic sites, your cache of local files is a little different. What you need in the cache is all  the resources required to render the app UI plus cached data or some extra content to explain why  there’s no data. You can spoof the data as we did earlier in the chapter, or, in the next chapter, I’ll  show you how to cache data for offline use.   94  Chapter 4  Resource Caching  With the list of cached resources in place, the following fetch event listener shows how to imple- ment a network-first, cache-next approach:  self.addEventListener 'fetch', event => {   console.log `SW: ${event.type} ${event.request.url}` ;      fires whenever the app requests a resource  file or data    event.respondWith         try to get the file from the network     fetch event.request        .catch    => {            rats, network resources are not available            do we have it in the cache?         console.log `SW: Trying Cache ${event.request.url}` ;         return caches.match event.request            .then response => {                if it is, then return the cached response                object from the cache             if  response  {               console.log `SW: Return Cache ${event.request.url}` ;               return response;             }           }        }     ; } ;  The complete service worker code for this example is in the project folder’s  public\service-workers\sw-46.js file.  Network First, Update Cache In all the examples so far, the cache we used was static, populated during service worker installation  and never updated again. That’s not very exciting, is it? This approach forces the service worker to  manually rebuild the cache with every version, even if the file didn’t change or wasn’t used again.  Another approach is to let the service worker build the cache as the app runs, automatically  populating the cache with every resource requested by the app. This one’s a little tricky, so hold  on while I lay it all out for you.  For the Tip Calculator app from Chapter 2, this is the perfect caching strategy. Every request the  app makes is automatically cached. So, if you install the app or later try to hit the app while the  device is out of network connectivity, the app will load, in its entirety, from cache.  When I implemented this caching strategy for the PWA News app, I was a little worried about the  app’s news data. The way that Bing structures its news results, the data comes back as a JSON object  with URLs pointing to any images associated with the articles  typically thumbnail images . I  didn’t want to cache those images because they’d change with every news update and I didn’t want  to fill up the cache with unused images, nor did I want to figure out a way to clean them up either.  As I tested the code I’ll share with you in a minute, I noticed that everything was taken care of  automatically for me. Woohoo! Let me explain.   Implementing Additional Caching Strategies  95  The following code implements a service worker fetch event listener that caches every request  made by the server. What I found in my testing was that it cached every resource request, even  the API request to the server to retrieve new data. What it didn’t do was cache the image files— automatically, not because I did anything special to make that happen. Not only did it not cache  the image files for me, the web app still displayed the image files for me when I disabled the  network and reloaded the page. Surprised? Yeah, me too. Take a moment to look through the  code, and I’ll explain everything on the other side.  self.addEventListener 'fetch', event => {   console.log `SW: ${event.type} ${event.request.url}` ;      fires whenever the app requests a resource  file or data    event.respondWith         try to get the file from the network     fetch event.request           whew, we got it       .then response => {            do we have a valid response?         if  response && response.status == 200  {              clone the response; it's a stream, so we can't              write it to the cache and return it as well           let responseClone = response.clone  ;              try to open the cache           caches.open CACHE_NAME                 if we successfully opened the cache             .then function  cache  {               console.log `SW: Adding ${event.request.url} to the cache` ;                  then write our cloned response to the cache               cache.put event.request, responseClone ;             } ;              return the original response           return response;         } else {              return whatever error response we got from the server           return response;         }       }        .catch    => {            rats, network resources not available            do we have it in the cache?         console.log `SW: Trying Cache ${event.request.url}` ;         return caches.match event.request            .then response => {                if it is, then return the cached response                object from the cache             if  response  {               console.log `SW: Return Cache ${event.request.url}` ;               return response;             }           }        }      catch    ; } ;   96  Chapter 4  Resource Caching  The complete service worker code for this example is in the project folder’s  public\service-workers\sw-47.js file.  All right, for every resource request, this service worker does the following:   Tries to retrieve the resource from the network.   If it gets a response, it   Checks to see if the response is a valid response and not an error.  Clones the response  responses are streams, so the service worker can’t pass a response to   the browser and write it to the cache at the same time .   Writes the cloned response to the cache.  Returns the original response to the requestor.  If the response is not an HTTP response of 200  success , it returns whatever it has to the   requestor for the requestor to process the error.   If it gets an outright error, it   Checks the cache to see if it has the resource there.  If it does, it returns the cached resource.  Otherwise, it does nothing and lets the requestor deal with the problem  usually by   showing the page shown in Figure 4.8 .  As it processes all of the app’s requests, the requests return with different response types5 depend- ing on how the browser views the resource origin based on security settings in the browser and in  the app. Remember, service workers are all about security, so if you request a resource that’s not  from the same origin as the page requesting the resource, the service worker’s going to complain.  The way it complains here is by not caching the resource.  The service worker checks to see if the response is valid using the following code:  if  response && response.status == 200   Some examples you see online do it this way:  if  response && response.status == 200 && response.type == 'basic'   What I learned while testing this code is that the service worker will cache only resources with  a type of basic. There’s no need to check the type before caching. All the same origin requests  arrive as basic, but the image requests, because their origin is Bing and not the local API server,  are ignored and not added to the cache. To prove this, look at Figure 4.12; it shows the complete  resource cache generated by this fetch event listener.  5.  https:  developer.mozilla.org en-US docs Web API Response type   Implementing Additional Caching Strategies  97  Figure 4.12  Populated PWA News Cache  I mentioned that when I disabled the network, the news thumbnail image files appeared properly  in the app anyway. Why is that? Well, even though I have a service worker managing my cache  for me, the browser still respects the cache headers6 in the response headers. If you look at a Bing  image request response header in Fiddler,7 as shown in Figure 4.13, you’ll see that Bing sets a  Cache-Control max-age header for the resource in the highlighted portion of the image. This tells  the browser it can hold onto the image for 1,209,600 seconds if it wants to.  Figure 4.13  Bing Image Headers in Fiddler  6.  https:  developer.mozilla.org en-US docs Web HTTP Headers Cache-Control 7.  https:  www.telerik.com fiddler   98  Chapter 4  Resource Caching  So, even though you think the service worker has complete control over the cache, it doesn’t; it  has complete control over cache storage, but the browser controls the HTTP cache. If you’re test- ing away and notice that things aren’t refreshing properly for you, that’s because the browser may  be interfering. You may have to clear the browser cache for your latest resources to show.  Now, I’m not saying you couldn’t configure the cross-origin resource sharing  CORS  settings for  the app and allow the service worker to cache resources from another origin—you probably can.  My point is that this extra security protection worked in my favor as I implemented this service  worker caching example.  Wrap-Up In this chapter, I demonstrated many ways to build service workers to cache resources for a PWA.  I didn’t show you every possible caching strategy, but I did give you a strong foundational skill set  to use when you’re building your own PWAs.  In the next chapter, I’ll demonstrate how to use other capabilities of the browser to cache web app  data and deliver a different sort of offline operation than what I showed here.   5 Going the Rest of  the Way Offline with  Background Sync  In Chapter 4, “Resource Caching,” I showed multiple ways to use service workers and the  browser cache to cache web app resources, including application data. That approach works  well, because the browser is great at fetching resources and displaying them. All we did was add  a manager in the middle to enable our code to control what’s cached and what isn’t. In this  chapter, we take app resource caching to the next level, using service workers to enable offline  mode in a web app.  We do this using the PWA News app’s Feedback page, shown in Figure 5.1. This page currently  displays randomly generated feedback from imaginary site visitors. As we work through the  concepts in this chapter, we’ll add an input form to the page to capture visitor sentiment and use  the service workers background sync capabilities to ensure that the feedback is delivered to the  server when the browser has a network connection to the server.  The version of the app used in this chapter is a little different than the one from previous   chapters. In this version, I added the ability to submit sentiment to the server and update the  graph shown in the figure. In the coding examples for this chapter, we’ll make that  functionality  work even when the browser is offline, uploading recorded sentiment when the browser goes  back online.   100  Chapter 5  Going the Rest of the Way Offline with Background Sync  Figure 5.1  PWA News Feedback Page  Introducing Background Sync Background sync is a feature of service workers that enables web apps to ensure that user actions  aren’t lost even if the browser loses network connectivity or the user switches to another app or  closes the browser or the current tab. By user actions, I mean things such as:   Sending an email.   Subscribing to a newsletter.   Sending a chat message.   Submitting a form.  These actions are essentially any data created or updated in the web app that must be sent to the  server. The ability to fire and forget application actions and know they’ll complete whenever the  app  or the browser running the app  regains network connectivity is one of the most powerful  mobile app features enabled by PWAs. Web apps do this using service workers.   Introducing Background Sync  101  Developers have two options for implementing this functionality. The first option uses the  background sync process described in this chapter, and the other uses the browser’s ability to send  data between a service worker and a web app, as described in Chapter 7, “Passing Data between  Service Workers and Web Applications.” The difference between these two approaches is that back- ground sync accommodates scenarios in which service workers can’t send the data to the server  immediately; instead, the service worker retries the action whenever the browser comes back online   described later . The options described in Chapter 7 enable a web app to pass data between the two  entities  the web app and the service worker  and is really only useful for real-time operations.  To make background sync work, web apps share data with service workers through a local  database shared by both processes:   The service worker and the web app both open the same local database. The web app writes   action data to the database. The service worker reads action data from the database, then  deletes the action data once it’s successfully processed.   When the web app invokes background sync to process an action, it writes the action’s data   to the database and then fires off a sync event to the service worker to process the action.   When the service worker’s sync event listener receives the event, code in the event listener   reads the action data from the local database and does whatever it needs to do with the data.   If the browser  and therefore the service worker  has network connectivity and can perform   the action immediately, it does so. If the action succeeds, the service worker deletes the  action’s data from the local database. If it fails, it leaves the data there for the service worker  to try again the next time the sync event fires.   If the browser doesn’t have network connectivity, the browser queues up the event to try it   again later.   This can’t go on forever. After some time, the action must be allowed to pass on to greener   pastures. In this case, the browser warns the service worker that it’s done trying to complete  the action and the service worker must remove the data from the queue.  Figure 5.2 illustrates the process, highlighting the roles the browser and service worker play in the  process.  Figure 5.2  Service Worker Background Sync Overview   102  Chapter 5  Going the Rest of the Way Offline with Background Sync  To trigger a sync, a web app registers a sync event using the following code:  navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then reg => {   reg.sync.register 'doThatSyncThing' ; } ;  The call to navigator.serviceWorker.ready returns the current service worker’s registration  object  reg in the example  that the code uses to register the sync event.  You can also register a sync event inside of a service worker using the following code:  self.registration.sync.register 'doThatSyncThing' ;  Passed to the register method is an event tag identifying the sync event to the service worker.  You can use as many event tags as you want in your app; all that matters is that your service  worker has code ready to recognize and process the events  through their tags  as they come in.  The browser keeps track of all registered sync events for the service worker and fires the service  worker’s sync event listener repeatedly until the sync event resolves. How a browser manages  processing sync events varies depending on the browser, but in general it works like this:   If the browser is online, the sync event fires immediately, and the service worker attempts   to complete the action.   If the action fails, the browser waits a while before trying again. It should implement an   exponential backoff strategy whereby easy subsequent retry occurs after a longer delay.   If the browser status changes from offline to online, the browser tries again.   Eventually, the browser gives up, since it knows it’s likely never going to complete the   action—how long that takes is up to the browser.  Inside the service worker, an event listener listens for the sync event, then executes the code asso- ciated with the event tag passed with the sync event:  self.addEventListener 'sync', event => {   if  event.tag == 'doThatSyncThing'  {        do something...     } } ;   AddContact   DeleteMessage   SendMessage   SetStatus  Tags play an interesting role in this process. In general, an app uses tags in a way that enables  them to group actions together. For example, a chat app may use something like the following:   Offline Data Sync  103  Then, in the service worker, the app processes each type of event using separate blocks of code.  When the app registers a sync event, and there’s already a sync event queued up with the same  tag, the browser’s SyncManager doesn’t add a new event to the queue using the duplicate tag; it  sees that there’s already an event registered with that tag and ignores the new one, assuming the  service worker code processing the event will deal with all queued data for that particular event.  Earlier I mentioned that the browser will eventually give up on processing a sync event after it  tried a bunch of times without success. When this happens, it stops processing that event until  another sync event fires with the same tag. To protect itself from the impact of this, a web app  could generate a unique tag for each event, as shown here:  navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then reg => {   reg.sync.register 'doThatSyncThing-1' ; } ;  Then, when processing events, the service worker processes all events that match the specific  pattern, as shown here:  self.addEventListener 'sync', event => {   if  event.tag.startsWith 'doThatSyncThing'   {        do something...     } } ;  Like everything else with service workers, background sync makes heavy use of promises, so if you  didn’t feel comfortable with promises in the previous chapter, you should probably sharpen your  promises skills now before continuing.  Offline Data Sync Service workers don’t offer capabilities for managing offline data in web apps. Service work- ers run in the browser but don’t run all the time, and this limitation prohibits their use for real  background data synchronization. The browser wakes the service worker up only when there’s  work for it to do, using the event interfaces shown in previous chapters. Unfortunately, there is no  option for data events or timer events in service workers  today anyway; apparently, Google has  periodic background sync1 as a feature, but it’s not mainstream .  If your app requires data synchronization, you should use one of the many sync software   development kits  SDKs  available in the market, such as the ones from Amazon,2 Couchbase,3  and Firebase.4 Don’t write your own—it’s been done many times already by people smarter than  both of us.  1.  https:  www.chromestatus.com feature 5689383275462656 2.  https:  aws.amazon.com appsync  3.  https:  www.couchbase.com  4.  https:  firebase.google.com    104  Chapter 5  Going the Rest of the Way Offline with Background Sync  There is, in some cases, a simple workaround for this limitation. The PWA News app pulls data from  a server process, and users can’t make any updates to the news data, so a service worker–based sync  process can be easily implemented. The approach uses browser push and the poke-and-pull method   illustrated in Figure 5.3 :   Update the service worker so it creates a local database to host the news data and populates   it on activation.  the server.   Modify the web app so it looks for its news data in the database rather than getting it from    Update the server process so it sends a push notification  the poke  to the app whenever   there’s new news data available. Push notifications are covered in Chapter 6, “Push  Notifications.”   Add a push event listener to the service worker so it requests a news update from the server    the pull  whenever it receives a specific push notification from the server.  Figure 5.3  Service Worker-Based Poke and Pull   Choosing a Sync Database  105  The code in the web app that loads the news data from the local database must have a fallback  process that pulls the data from the server when it runs on a browser that doesn’t support service  workers. Remember, PWAs are progressively enhanced web apps, so they must work even when  service workers aren’t supported.  Is the poke-and-pull method the best approach for this app? No, probably not. But, for certain  types of apps, it is a reasonable approach. For example, many chat apps are built this way, using  push notifications or web sockets to let client applications know about new data.  Choosing a Sync Database As I showed in an earlier section, browsers don’t provide a direct mechanism for a web app to send  data to service workers for background sync. You must create a shared store accessible by both the  web app and the service worker. The web app queues data to the store then notifies the service  worker to pick it up and process it via the sync event.  There are many different ways you can implement this cache store in your web apps, but Google  recommends, and pretty much all background sync examples on the Internet use, the browser’s  IndexedDB5 database. The reason, described in Live Data in the Service Worker6 and Offline Storage  for Progressive Web Apps7 is that IndexedDB is asynchronous and available to service workers. Other  available options have limitations  synchronous instead of asynchronous, limits in data types,  etc. . With that in mind, we’ll use an IndexedDB database for the PWA News sync queue.  I’m not going to provide a detailed primer on IndexedDB; there’s a lot of good material available  online that I’m not inclined to duplicate. I will, however, share some core examples here to get us  both on the same page before we jump into enhancing the PWA News app for background sync.  If you’re already familiar with IndexedDB, feel free to skip ahead to the next section.  IndexedDB provides an outdated approach to asynchronous operation. Instead of using the  modern promise approach, it uses callbacks to handle asynchronous operations. This approach  leads quickly to the callback hell described in Chapter 4. To help developers avoid this problem,  the community responded with several promise-based wrappers around the IndexedDB API; you  can use these libraries to simplify the readability of your IndexedDB code. For this book, I decided  not to arbitrarily point you to a third-party library and instead to show you the old-school  callback hell way to interact with an IndexedDB database, but in the enhancements to the PWA  News application, I’ll implement a promise-based approach.  Create Database To create an IndexedDB database, a web app must execute the following code:  var theDB = window.indexedDB.open DATABASE_NAME, 1 ;  5.  https:  developer.mozilla.org en-US docs Web API IndexedDB_API 6.  https:  developers.google.com web ilt pwa live-data-in-the-service-worker 7.  https:  developers.google.com web fundamentals instant-and-offline web-storage offline-for-pwa   106  Chapter 5  Going the Rest of the Way Offline with Background Sync  This creates a theDB object pointing to an open database. If the database doesn’t exist when this  code executes, the browser creates the database. Service workers don’t have access to the browser’s  window object, so to create open an IndexedDB database, use the following code:  var theDB = self.indexedDB.open DATABASE_NAME, 1 ;  We want code that runs in both locations, because both the web app and the service worker must  open the database, so we’ll use the latter example for the PWA News app.  Remember, there are no promises here, so to report or act on database operation success or failure,  you must create callback functions. For IndexedDB operations, the two you’ll care the most about  are the onsuccess and onerror callbacks:  theDB.onsuccess = function  event  {   console.log 'Open Success' ;      get a handle to the database   let db = event.target.result;    };   theDB.onerror = function  event  {   console.log 'Open Error' ;   };  theDB.onclose = function  event  {   console.log 'Closing database' ;    }   theDB.abort = function  event  {   console.log 'Aborting...' ;    }  The onsuccess callback gets an event object you can use to get a handle to the database object,  as shown in the example. If you keep a reference to the theDB object, you can also access the  database later from  let db = theDB.result;  The database object also supports other callback options:  You may have noticed that I passed a number to the call to the IndexedDB open method. That  parameter specifies the version number for the database. When you open an IndexedDB database,  the browser checks the version number you provided against an existing database; if they’re different,  as will be the case when you create a new database, the browser fires the onupgradeneeded callback.  This callback gives the app an opportunity to make any database changes required by the new version.  theDB.onupgradeneeded = function  event  {   console.log 'Database upgrade needed' ;      do something interesting   }   Choosing a Sync Database  107  Create Store IndexedDB groups related data into stores;8 you’ll need at least one store to manage data for an  application. The database’s onupgradeneeded callback is the perfect place to create it:  const STORE_NAME = 'my-store'; theDB.onupgradeneeded = function  event  {   console.log 'Database upgrade needed' ;      does the store already exist?   if  !db.objectStoreNames.contains STORE_NAME   {        no? Then create it     console.log 'creating store' ;     var storeOptions = { keyPath: "idx", autoIncrement: true };     var theStore = db.createObjectStore STORE_NAME, storeOptions ;   } else {     console.log 'Store already exists' ;   } }  As you can probably tell from the name, IndexedDB is an indexed database, so you can create  multiple indexes in a store and use them to more easily locate objects in the store. In this example,  I simply created an index called idx that the IndexedDB engine automatically increments for me.  This gives the app a unique identifier it can use to locate and work with every object in the store.  Add Data Using the previous examples as a base, an app adds a data object to a store by executing the  following code:  That’s a lot of intermediate variables, right? Well, you can simplify this using the following:     get a handle to the db let db = theDB.result; let transaction = db.transaction [STORE_NAME], "readonly" ;    get a handle to the store let store = transaction.objectStore STORE_NAME ;    finally, add the record let request = add { key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2' } ;     get a handle to the db let db = theDB.result; let request = db.transaction [STORE_NAME], "readwrite"    .objectStore STORE_NAME    .add { key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2' } ;   request.onsuccess = function  event  {   console.log 'Add successful' ;   };    8.  https:  developer.mozilla.org en-US docs Web API IDBObjectStore   108  Chapter 5  Going the Rest of the Way Offline with Background Sync  request.onerror = function  event  {   console.error 'Add failure' ;   }  And, of course, we have the standard callback functions for success and failure.  IndexedDB is a transactional database system, so an app must make database updates through  transactions that you can later abort using the transaction object’s abort method. IndexedDB  is also an indexed object store, so in this last example, the code added an object to the store.  To see the results of this code, you must use the browser’s developer tools, as shown in Figure 5.4.  In this figure, I opened the developer tools, then selected the Application tab across the top. Next,  I expanded the IndexedDB option in the left navigator. Chrome doesn’t automatically refresh the  contents of this pane, so I had to right-click on IndexedDB and select Refresh IndexedDB before  I could see my database and store.  Figure 5.4  Chrome Developer Tools: IndexedDB Data  In the figure, you can see the generated key plus the data object associated with the key. Notice  that the code didn’t include the idx object in the call to add, but IndexedDB added it there  automatically for you.  Delete Objects To delete an object from an IndexedDB store, an app needs the index for the object and the  following code:     get a handle to the db let db = theDB.result; let idx = 3;   Choosing a Sync Database  109  Iterating through Data Using Cursors To loop through objects in a store, IndexedDB uses cursors. A web app opens a cursor and, if the  cursor is not null, uses it to retrieve the data object from the store:  let request = db.transaction [STORE_NAME], "readwrite"    .objectStore STORE_NAME    .delete idx ;      success! request.onsuccess = function  event  {   console.log 'Item ${idx} deleted' ;   }      ugh, error request.onerror = function  event  {   console.log 'Unable to delete item ${idx}' ;   }     get a handle to the db let db = theDB.result; var request = db.transaction [STORE_NAME], "readonly"    .objectStore STORE_NAME    .openCursor  ;      success! request.onsuccess = function  event  {      get a handle to the cursor   var cursor = event.target.result;      do we have a valid cursor?   if  cursor  {        get the object value from the cursor     item = cursor.value;        do something with the item's data          Move onto the next item in the object store     cursor.continue  ;   } else {        no valid cursor, so must be at the end     } };      ugh, error request.onerror = function  event  {   console.error request.error ;      do something with the error   }   110  Chapter 5  Going the Rest of the Way Offline with Background Sync  In the example, item points to the object {key1: "value1", key2: "value2", idx: 1}.  The app accesses object values through item.key1, item.key2, and item.idx.  When the app’s done processing the data accessible through the cursor, it makes a call to cursor. continue, which moves the cursor to the next object in the store. This creates a loop where the  cursor moves through all the store objects until it’s done, at which point the code drops into the  else clause to wrap up the process.  This is basically everything you need to know about IndexedDB to add background sync to the  PWA News app. In the following sections, we’ll take the PWA News app’s existing process of  directly POSTing user sentiment data to the server and update it to use service worker background  sync instead. I’ll fill in all the details about how background sync works through the code we add  to the PWA News app.  Preparing to Code The work we do in this chapter revolves around the code for the server app available in the book’s  GitHub repository at https:  github.com johnwargo learning-pwa-code. I provided complete  instructions for how to download the code and configure your development environment in the  section “Preparing to Code” in Chapter 3, “Service Workers.” If you haven’t already completed  those steps, go there and complete them before picking up here again.  Open a terminal window and navigate the terminal into the cloned project’s  \learning-pwa-code\chapter-05\pwa-news\ folder. This folder contains the Chapter 5 version  of the PWA News server application  which has all the code changes you were supposed to make  in Chapter 4 .  Install all the dependencies required by the application by executing the following command:  This command uses the Node Package Manager  npm  to install Node.js modules used by the  server.  If you ran the copy-config command during the setup process in Chapter 3, you’re  good. Skip ahead to running the npm command after the next paragraph. If not, copy the  config.ts file from \learning-pwa-code\chapter-03\app\ to  \learning-pwa-code\chapter-05\pwa-news\app\. This copies the configuration file holding  the Bing API key you used in Chapter 3. With the file copied, execute the following command:  This compiles the server’s .ts files  including the copied config.ts file  into the .js files you  see in the project root folder. You’ll see some errors and warnings from the code’s references to  some of the objects in the code, but you should be OK if it all worked in Chapter 3.  With all the parts in place, it’s time to start the server. In the terminal window, execute the  following command:  npm install  tsc  npm start   Enhancing the PWA News Application  111  If everything’s set up properly in the code, the server will respond with the following text in the  terminal:  pwa-news-server@0.0.1 start D:\learning-pwa-code\chapter-05\pwa-news node . bin www  At this point, you’re all set—the server is up and running and ready to serve content. If you see an  error message, you must dig through any reported errors and resolve them before continuing.  To see the web app in its current state, open Google Chrome or a browser that supports service  workers and navigate to:  http:  localhost:3000  After a short delay, the server should render the app as shown in Figure 3.1. At this point, you’re  ready to code.  Enhancing the PWA News Application The PWA News app’s Feedback page displays a chart showing visitor sentiment for the site. There’s  also a select dropdown and a button that visitors can use to submit their feedback about the  site. At this point in our chapter progression, the app’s service worker has code to cache all app  resources, including the feedback page, so the app will run using cached data even when the  device running the app is outside of network coverage. What the app can’t do, which we’ll fix in  this chapter, is accept visitor feedback when offline. We’ll use background sync and some compli- cated code writing to accomplish this goal. Ready?  For the rest of this chapter, we’ll work with the web app code found in the book’s GitHub reposi- tory’s chapter-05\pwa-news\public\ folder.  Preparing the Service Worker for Background Sync Start by opening the project’s public\sw.js file; the service worker doesn’t know anything about  sync events, so we’re going to fix that first. At the bottom of the file, add the following code:  self.addEventListener 'sync', event => {      process the Submit Feedback action items   if  event.tag == 'feedback'  {     console.log 'SW: Processing Feedback sync' ;     } else {     console.log `SW: Unrecognized sync event:  ${event.tag} ` ;   } } ;  This code registers the event listener for the sync event discussed earlier in the chapter. It doesn’t  do anything right now except log the event; we’ll add code later to act on feedback requests. For  now, we just need a place in the service worker to validate the changes we’ll make next in the  feedback page.   112  Chapter 5  Going the Rest of the Way Offline with Background Sync  Tip Remember, the service worker registers from the project’s index.html file, so if you make any  changes to the service worker, you must refresh the service worker from the app’s home page,  then switch to the Feedback page to see the results.        Updating the Web App to Use Background Sync Now we need to implement changes to the web app’s Feedback page so it uses background sync to  upload visitor sentiment to the server.  Open the project’s public\js\feedback.js file. If you look toward the bottom of the file, you’ll  find the following code:  function submitFeedback event  {   console.log 'submitFeedback  ' ;      get the selected item from the form   var theSelect = document.getElementById "sentiment" ;   let selectedSentiment = theSelect.options[theSelect.selectedIndex].value;   console.log `Selected Sentiment: ${selectedSentiment}` ;      do we have a sentiment value? We should.   if  selectedSentiment  {        post it to the server using fetch     postFeedback selectedSentiment ;   } }  This is the function that starts the process of sending visitor feedback to the server. The code  checks to see that there’s a sentiment value selected on the page, then calls the file’s postFeed- back function to POST it to the server using fetch. There should always be one value selected on  the form, but I prefer to make few assumptions when it comes to user input.  Note I could easily have added the code to POST the feedback to the server in this same function,  and the first version of this code did that, but I knew I’d be expanding the capabilities of this  function in this chapter, so I broke the POST process into a separate function to make things  cleaner for you later.        Now, replace the call to postFeedback with the following code:  if  'serviceWorker' in navigator && 'SyncManager' in window  {      yes, save the feedback to the database     } else {      service worker or background sync not supported      so we'll do this the old-fashioned way   postFeedback selectedSentiment ; }   Enhancing the PWA News Application  113  This is an if statement that checks to see if the browser supports service workers and the  SyncManager. If they are supported, IndexedDB should be available as well, and we can create a  database and use background sync to submit visitor sentiment to the server. You could also check  for indexedDB if you wanted to be completely thorough.  This code moves the call to postFeedback to the else clause of the if statement. It is our  fallback to regular operation when a visitor uses a browser that doesn’t support service workers.  If you omit this fallback, users on older browsers will curse you because their sentiment never  seems to make it to the server no matter how many times they click the button.  The last piece of this is to add the code that opens the local IndexedDB database and writes the  selected sentiment value to the store. Now, the code we’re about to add refers to functions that  don’t exist yet, so don’t panic when your integrated development environment  IDE  or editor  starts to complain about some of the code. Add the following code inside the if clause of the  if then statement we just added a minute ago; I’m hoping it’s clear what the code does, but I’ll  explain it anyway on the other side.  openIDB     .then db => {     queueFeedback db, selectedSentiment        .then    => {         console.log 'submitFeedback: Successfully queued feedback' ;       }        .catch error => {         console.error error ;         Swal.fire 'Sync Error', error, 'error' ;       }    }  All right, what’s happening here is that we’re calling a function called openIDB  which we haven’t  written yet , and when the promise it returns resolves, we’re calling another function called  queueFeedback  another function we haven’t written yet  that adds the selected sentiment value  to the database we just opened. Both functions return promises, so that’s why there are so many  thens and catches in the code. The call to openIDB returns a handle to the database that was  just created or opened. The code then passes that value to the call to queueFeedback so it doesn’t  have to figure out where it’s writing its stuff.  Here’s the complete listing for the new submitFeedback function:  function submitFeedback   {      the user tapped the Share Sentiment button   console.log 'submitFeedback  ' ;      get the selected item from the form   var theSelect = document.getElementById "sentiment" ;   let selectedSentiment = theSelect.options[theSelect.selectedIndex].value;      do we have a sentiment selected? we should   if  selectedSentiment  {     console.log `submitFeedback: '${selectedSentiment}' selected` ;        is IndexedDB supported?     if  'serviceWorker' in navigator && 'SyncManager' in window  {          yes, save the feedback to the database   114  Chapter 5  Going the Rest of the Way Offline with Background Sync        openIDB           .then db => {           queueFeedback db, selectedSentiment              .then    => {               console.log 'submitFeedback: Successfully queued feedback' ;             }              .catch error => {               console.error error ;               Swal.fire 'Sync Error', error, 'error' ;             }          }      } else {          service worker or sync not supported          so do this the old-fashioned way       postFeedback selectedSentiment ;     }   } };  The call to Swal refers to SweetAlert2,9 an open source library for generating visually pleasant  alert dialogs in web apps. The first quoted string is the title for the alert dialog. The second  parameter  error  is the error message returned from the call to queueFeedback, and the final  'error' tells SweetAlert2 to display an error dialog.  The complete feedback code for this example is in the project folder’s  \public\chapter-code\feedback-5.js file.  With that code in place, it’s time to start writing the code that interacts with the local IndexedDB  database. If you remember the description of how the sync process works, both the web app  and the service worker access the database at different times. The web app accesses the database  with write capabilities when it queues up the sentiment value for processing. The service worker  accesses the database with read and write capabilities when it processes the queue of sentiment  data. The service worker requires read and write access because it uses read to read the data from  the store and write when it deletes the value after successful processing.  If you’re thinking the way I do about the code I just described, you probably realized that both  processes probably run some of the same code to do what they do. To minimize typing the same  code in both the web app and service worker, we’re going to put all of it in the same file and access  it from both processes. Add a new file to the project called \public\js\db.js, then open it for  editing.  At the top of the file, add the following constants:     IndexedDB DB and Store Properties const DB_NAME = 'pwa-news'; const DB_VERSION = 1; const STORE_NAME = 'feedback-store';  9.  https:  sweetalert2.github.io    Enhancing the PWA News Application  115  The module code references the store name in several places, so I moved the value into a con- stant so I wouldn’t have to type it everywhere. I pulled the database version into a constant here  because I may change this value with every app version, and I wanted the value in an easy place  to find later. It’s used only once, but putting it at the top of the file makes it very easy to change  later. Finally, I moved the database name into a constant here just because; I had everything else  here, so it made sense to have the database name here as well.  Next, add the openIDB function, shown next, to the new file. The function uses the concepts  described earlier in the chapter to open the IndexedDB database and return the database object to  the calling function so it can use it later to interact with the open database.  function openIDB   {      open the indexedDB database used by the app   return new Promise  resolve, reject  => {        open the feedback database     var theDB = self.indexedDB.open DB_NAME, DB_VERSION ;          success, callback     theDB.onsuccess = function  event  {       console.log 'openIDB: Successfully opened database' ;          success, return the db object result       resolve event.target.result ;     };          define the database error callback     theDB.onerror = function  event  {       let msg = `Database error ${theDB.error}`;       console.error `openIDB: ${msg}` ;       Swal.fire 'Database Error', msg, 'error' ;          reject the promise, we failed          include the error message with the failure       reject msg ;     };       theDB.onupgradeneeded = function  event  {       console.log 'openIDB: Database upgrade needed' ;          get a handle to the database       var db = event.target.result;          does the store already exist?       if  !db.objectStoreNames.contains STORE_NAME   {            no? Then create it         console.log `openIDB: Creating store ${STORE_NAME}` ;            first create the configuration options for the store         var storeOptions = { keyPath: "idx", autoIncrement: true };            then create the store         var theStore = db.createObjectStore STORE_NAME, storeOptions ;       };     };   } ; };   116  Chapter 5  Going the Rest of the Way Offline with Background Sync  When you open an IndexedDB database, and it doesn’t already exist, the act of opening it creates  it for you.  In the onupgradeneeded callback, the code checks to see if the store we need already exists and  creates it if it’s not already there.  The last piece of this is the code that follows. It takes the selected sentiment and stores it in the  database inside the feedback-store store. Like the generic example shown earlier, this function  adds a data object  in this case, { timestamp: Date.now  , sentiment: feedback }  to the  store, then registers the sync event that tells the service worker there’s data there for it to process.  I added a timestamp to the data object thinking I might display the submission date in the con- sole as the service worker processed each queued feedback item. I never got around to doing that,  but if you want, it’s there for you to use in your version of the app.  Add the following function to the project’s db.js file:  function queueFeedback db, feedback  {   console.log 'queueFeedback  ' ;   return new Promise  resolve, reject  => {     let request = db.transaction [STORE_NAME], "readwrite"        .objectStore STORE_NAME        .add { timestamp: Date.now  , sentiment: feedback } ;       request.onsuccess = function  event  {       console.log 'queueFeedback: Successfully added feedback' ;       navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then reg => {         console.log 'queueFeedback: Registering sync event' ;            fire off the sync request            to the service worker         reg.sync.register 'feedback'            .then    => {                tell the user             Swal.fire {               type: 'info',               title: 'Request Queued',               text: 'Your sentiment rating was queued for ' +                 'submission to the server.',               footer: 'Please refresh the page.'             } ;                and resolve the promise             resolve  ;           }            .catch    => {                I can't think of why this would happen             reject  ;           }          } ;     };     Enhancing the PWA News Application  117      request.onerror = function  event  {          unable to create transaction       reject db.error ;     };   } ; };        Refresh on Success In the submitFeedback function in feedback.js, the code automatically refreshes the feed- back data after successfully POSTing the data to the server. The function can do this because  the code submitting the data to the server and refreshing the feedback data are both available  to the Feedback page. When we switch the app to use background sync for this, we lose the  ability to refresh the page because the page never knows that the data was successfully sub- mitted. The service worker does, but it can’t directly refresh the page on success  more on this  later . In the background sync version of the app, the success dialog suggests a page refresh after  queueing the data in the hope that the data will upload by the time the user refreshes the  page. If the browser is offline or there’s some other issue with data upload, then refreshing the  page is a waste of time. There are other options. What I could have done, but chose not to, was check for network connectivity when the user  clicks the Share Sentiment button, then call postFeedback if there’s network connectivity and  queueFeedback when there isn’t. This approach would give the app an online offline feel, and  it’s probably the best solution, but as this chapter is all about going offline, I decided to go all  in on offline. I mentioned earlier that the browser can’t directly refresh the page, and that was almost a lie   sorry . In the next chapter, you’ll learn about a mechanism that allows service workers to send  messages to a browser window, and you could easily use this feature to send a refresh mes- sage to the web app after uploading data. I left that topic out of this chapter because it makes  more sense in the next chapter and would have thoroughly complicated this chapter. If you  want extra credit, after finishing the next chapter, come back here and implement it and post  your results somewhere for others.     The complete service worker code for this example is in the project folder’s  \public\chapter-code\db.js file.  Finally, we need the Feedback page to load this new JavaScript file. Open the project’s  public\feedback.html and add the following lines to the bottom of the page’s body section,  along with the other script tags.        Save your changes to both files and refresh the Home page, then switch to the Feedback page.  Remember, the service worker loads from the project’s index.html file but reigns over all pages of  the app. You must refresh the Home page to load the updates to the service worker, then switch to  the Feedback page to load the other half of our code changes.   118  Chapter 5  Going the Rest of the Way Offline with Background Sync  Select one of the sentiments from the dropdown field and click the Share Sentiment button. The  app should immediately display the queue dialog shown in Figure 5.5. At this point, we think we  queued some data for processing by the service worker—let’s check.  Figure 5.5  Submitting Feedback  Open the browser’s developer tools and switch to the Application tab. In the left navigator,  expand the IndexedDB option and refresh the content. You should see the feedback data queued  up, as shown in Figure 5.6.  Figure 5.6  Feedback Data Queued for Processing by the Service Worker   Enhancing the PWA News Application  119  The data is still there because we haven’t added any code to the service worker to process it; we’ll  do that in the next section.  Finishing the Service Worker Our final step is to complete the enhancements to the service worker so it knows how to process  the feedback queue. In this section, we   Add a reference to the new db.js file in the service worker.   Finish the code in the service worker’s sync event listener.   Add two functions to the project’s db.js file.  Open the project’s public\sw.js file and add the following lines of code to the top of the file:     the server feedback API endpoint const FEEDBACK_URL = `${self.location.origin} api sentiment`;  This service worker will use this constant to connect to the server when processing feedback.  Next, add the following line to the install event listener before the call to skipWaiting  :  self.importScripts '. js db.js' ;  Remember, the service worker runs in a separate process from the web application, so it doesn’t  know you’ve already loaded the database library in the feedback page. You must explicitly load it  in the service worker as well.  The result should look like this:  self.addEventListener 'install', event => {      fires when the browser installs the app      here we're just logging the event and the contents      of the object passed to the event. the purpose of this event      is to give the service worker a place to set up the local       environment after the installation completes.   console.log `SW: Event fired: ${event.type}` ;   console.dir event ;   self.importScripts '. js db.js' ;      Force service worker activation   self.skipWaiting  ; } ;  All right, now it’s time to tell the service worker how to process the queued feedback. The code  we’re about to work through is probably the most complicated code we’ve looked at so far. To  explain it as cleanly as I can, I’ve identified the high-level steps in Table 5.1.   120  Chapter 5  Going the Rest of the Way Offline with Background Sync  Table 5.1  Service Worker Queue Processing Step Description  Method  1  2  3  4  5  event.waitUntil    Instruct the service worker to stay active  not shut down   until everything completes.  getFeedbackItems    Get the feedback items from the data store.  Promise.all   and  data.items.map    Loop through each of the feedback items.  fetch    POST the data to the server.  deleteFeedback    Delete processed feedback from the data store.  Everything the service worker does here is asynchronous, so I’m using promises everywhere.  Update the existing sync event listener in the project’s service worker; I’ll explain the code after  you’re done reading it:  self.addEventListener 'sync', event => {   console.log 'SW: Sync event fired' ;   if  event.tag === 'feedback'  {     console.log 'SW: Processing Feedback sync' ;     event.waitUntil        getFeedbackItems           .then data => {           return Promise.all                 loop through the items array             data.items.map function  feedbackItem  {                  update the server if you can               return fetch FEEDBACK_URL, {                 method: 'post',                 headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application json' },                 body: JSON.stringify {                   sentiment: feedbackItem.sentiment                 }                }                  .then    => {                      successfully posted,                       so whack the record at idx                   return deleteFeedback data.db, feedbackItem.idx                  }                  .catch error => {                      ruh roh, something went wrong                   console.error `SW: Sync Error: ${error}` ;                 }              }             ;         }  ;   Enhancing the PWA News Application  121    } else {        this should never happen     console.log `SW: Unrecognized sync event  ${event.tag} ` ;   } } ;  Here’s what the code does:   We don’t want the browser to shut down the service worker until it’s done processing the  queue, so the code starts with a call to event.waitUntil   that instructs the browser’s  SyncManager to wait until we’re done.   waitUntil expects a promise, so getFeedbackItems creates one  we’ll add that code in a   minute  then gets to work.   getFeedbackItems connects to the database and builds an array of all the feedback items,   then returns it as the result of the promise.   The code loops through the feedback item array. It uses Promise.all   to say it’s about to  make a bunch of promises, and it will resolve  success  if they all succeed or reject  failure   if one fails.   Inside that Promise.all  , it uses the array.map   method to execute a function against   each element in the array.   The map method makes a call to fetch   to POST the data to the server for each item in the   array. The fetch method returns a promise, so that makes Promise.all   happy.   When the POST completes successfully, the code calls deleteFeedback  , which   deletes the processed item from the store  we’ll add that code in a minute . Oh, and  deleteFeedback returns a promise too.  The result is that if the feedback item is successfully uploaded to the server  using fetch , the  processed item is deleted from the store. That was a lot of code to accomplish that simple act,  wasn’t it?  The reason promises are so important here is because promises give the code an easy way to filter  results back up through the cascading method calls I just explained. If just one part of the process  fails, for whatever reason, we want everything left in place for the next time the service worker  wakes up to process the queue. Promises give us an easy way to manage that.  The complete service worker code for this example is in the project folder’s  \public\chapter-code\sw-5.js file.  Most browser developer tools provide a way to send sync messages to a service worker directly  from the browser  rather than having to do it via code . In Google’s Chrome browser, open the  developer tools, switch to the Application tab, then select the Service worker panel, as shown in  Figure 5.7. Look for the Sync input field highlighted in the figure. Enter the sync tag, then click  the Sync button to send the tag to the sync event listener in the service worker.   122  Chapter 5  Going the Rest of the Way Offline with Background Sync  Figure 5.7  PWA News Feedback Page  With the service worker all sorted out, open the project’s public js db.js file. At the bottom of  the file, add the following function:  function getFeedbackItems   {   console.log 'DB: getFeedbackItems  ' ;        will hold the array of feedback items   let items = [];     return new Promise  resolve, reject  => {        yes, save the feedback to the database     openIDB         .then db => {         let request = db.transaction [STORE_NAME], "readonly"            .objectStore STORE_NAME            .openCursor  ;              success!         request.onsuccess = function  event  {              get a handle to the cursor           var cursor = event.target.result;              do we have a valid cursor?           if  cursor  {                add the feedback item to the array             items.push cursor.value ;                move onto the next item in the object store             cursor.continue  ;           } else {   Enhancing the PWA News Application  123                 no valid cursor, so must be at the end             resolve { db: db, items: items } ;           }         };              ugh, error         request.onerror = function  event  {           console.error request.error ;           reject request.error ;         }       }      openIDB         .catch error => {         console.error request.error ;         reject request.error ;       } ;    openIDB     } ; };  The getFeedbackItems function   Creates a promise  of course .   Opens the IndexedDB database.   Opens a cursor in the feedback-store store.   Loops through each object in the store using the cursor.   Adds each object to the items array.   Returns the database object and items array.  Finally, add the following function to the bottom of the db.js file:  function deleteFeedback db, idx  {   console.log `DB: deleteFeedback: Processing index ${idx}` ;     return new Promise  resolve, reject  => {        create a transaction     let request = db.transaction [STORE_NAME], "readwrite"        .objectStore STORE_NAME        .delete idx ;          success!     request.onsuccess = function  event  {       console.log `DB: deleteFeedback: Item ${idx} deleted` ;       resolve idx ;     }    The code returns the database object so the next function we’ll add can use it. It simplifies the  code by not forcing me to create an ugly global variable to hold the database object.   124  Chapter 5  Going the Rest of the Way Offline with Background Sync         ugh, error     request.onerror = function  event  {       console.log `DB: deleteFeedback: Unable to delete item ${idx}` ;       console.error transaction.error ;       reject transaction.error ;     }   } ; };   Gets the database object and the index of the feedback item being deleted as parameters   The deleteFeedback function  passed to the function.   Creates a promise  of course .   Using the database object, creates a transaction for managing the changes to the data store.    Deletes the selected item  using its index as a pointer to the feedback item being deleted .  The complete service worker code for this example is in the project folder’s  \public\chapter-code\db.js file.  At this point, we’re done with code changes. Save all the changes to the files, switch to the browser,  and refresh the Home page. Remember, the service worker loads from the project’s index.html file  but reigns over all pages of the app. You must refresh the Home page to load the updates to the ser- vice worker, then switch to the Feedback page to load the other half of our code changes.  Go ahead and submit a new feedback, then switch to the Developer Tools console page. You  should see your queued-up feedback items processing, as shown in Figure 5.8.  Figure 5.8  Chrome Developer Tools Console Output Showing Feedback Queue Processing   Enhancing the PWA News Application  125  Try taking the application offline and submitting some feedback. When you turn the network  connection back on, the service worker should wake up and immediately process the queued items.  We just went through a lot of code and generated a lot of promises, but we now have a version of  the PWA News site that works as expected online or offline.  Dealing with Last Chances Early on, I mentioned that if background sync fails, then the browser will retry it again later. What  I didn’t say, and what is not documented, is how many times the browser will retry until it gets it  right. I heard somewhere that browsers use an internal exponential backoff algorithm to control  how frequently they retry. Looking around to understand this better, I came across an article titled  Chrome, the Background Sync API and Exponential Backoff, which looks at this specific question.  Thinking about this problem, you’d think the browser would retry 5, 10, or 20 times before  abandoning a sync event, but it turns out that browsers such as Chrome retry the sync only  twice before abandoning it. To quote a line from Kevin Kline’s character in A Fish Called Wanda:  “Disappointed!”  For our simple PWA News Feedback page, trying to deliver the data only three times isn’t a big  deal. For a more transactional app such as a chat app or banking app, I really want more. The  good news is that the browser’s SyncManager at least tells you when it’s about to abandon your  request. The following listing contains a quick copy and paste of the event object passed to the  service worker’s sync event listener. In there you should see the lastChance property. It’s false  now, because it was grabbed from a first pass at processing the sync event.  bubbles: false cancelBubble: false cancelable: false composed: false currentTarget: ServiceWorkerGlobalScope {clients: Clients, registration:   ServiceWorkerRegistration, onactivate: null, onfetch: null, oninstall: null, ...}  defaultPrevented: false eventPhase: 0 isTrusted: true lastChance: false path: [] returnValue: true srcElement: ServiceWorkerGlobalScope {clients: Clients, registration:   ServiceWorkerRegistration, onactivate: null, onfetch: null, oninstall: null, ...}  tag: "feedback" target: ServiceWorkerGlobalScope {clients: Clients, registration:   ServiceWorkerRegistration, onactivate: null, onfetch: null, oninstall: null, ...}  timeStamp: 0 type: "sync" _ _proto_ _: SyncEvent  When the browser’s SyncManager has had enough with this sync event, it switches lastChance to  true so you’ll know what’s coming next and can act the way that makes the most sense for your app.   126  Chapter 5  Going the Rest of the Way Offline with Background Sync  In the service worker, you could do something like this:     is this the last time the browser will     process this event? if  event.lastChance  {   console.warn `SW: ${event.tag.toUpperCase  } sync last chance` ; }  This just throws a warning to the console, but the user will never see that, and it doesn’t actually  do anything. Do you remember earlier when I mentioned that you could register a sync event  inside of the service worker? Well, that is one way to keep this sync event alive. If your code learns  that the SyncManager is about to abandon this sync event and there’s still data to process, simply  resubmit the background sync using  self.registration.sync.register 'feedback'   This is a little dangerous in that it forces the service worker to process the event forever, but hey, it  works.  So, in our current service worker example, the preceding code would go into the sync event listener:  self.addEventListener 'sync', event => {   console.log 'SW: Sync event fired' ;      is this the last time the browser will       process this event?   if  event.lastChance  {     console.warn `SW: ${event.tag.toUpperCase  } sync last chance` ;   }   if  event.tag === 'feedback'  {     console.log 'SW: Processing Feedback sync' ;     event.waitUntil        getFeedbackItems           .then data => {           return Promise.all                 loop through the items array             data.items.map function  feedbackItem  {                  update the server if you can               return fetch FEEDBACK_URL, {                 method: 'post',                 headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application json' },                 body: JSON.stringify {                   sentiment: feedbackItem.sentiment                 }                }                  .then    => {                      successfully posted,                       so whack the record at idx                   return deleteFeedback data.db, feedbackItem.idx                  }                  .catch error => {                      ruh roh, something went wrong                   console.error `SW: Sync Error: ${error}` ;   Enhancing the PWA News Application  127                    if  event.lastChance  {                        do something to handle the last event                        warn the user, submit the event again                     self.registration.sync.register 'feedback' ;                   }                 }              }             ;         }  ;   } else {        this should never happen     console.log `SW: Unrecognized sync event  ${event.tag} ` ;   } } ;  All right, back to this exponential fallback algorithm. Because the referenced article was a  little old, I thought things might have changed in the browser, so using the article’s code  as a starting point, I embellished it a bit and ran it in the browser to see how the browser  manages fallback. Trust, but verify, right? You can find my complete code listing in  \learning-pwa-code\chapter-05\fallback-test.  What I did to test this code was load it in the browser, then stop the server process running in the  terminal window. What I learned is highlighted in Figure 5.9.  Figure 5.9  Chrome Background Sync Fallback Results   128  Chapter 5  Going the Rest of the Way Offline with Background Sync  When the SyncManager detects that it can’t complete processing a sync event, it waits 5 minutes  and tries again. If the retry fails, the SyncManager waits 15 minutes and tries it again, but this  time it switches the lastChance property from false to true. That’s not a very sophisticated  algorithm; I can’t imagine a PhD over at Google spent a lot of time on that one.  Anyway, that’s a limitation of background sync you must be aware of and accommodate in your  apps. If the data is important, you’re going to have to force the browser to retry the sync more  than twice using the strategy I presented in this section.  Wrap-Up We covered a lot of code in this chapter, and you learned a lot about background sync. Our PWA  News app is feature complete; it works while online and offline using resource and data caching  plus background sync for data submission. I hope you had as much fun reading this chapter as  I had writing it.  In the next chapter, we dig into the last real PWA topic covered in the book: browser notifications.   6 Push Notifications  One of the things that makes mobile apps so engaging is the mobile platform push notifica- tion capabilities that enable app developers to send information to the device running the app.  Depending on the device OS and the type of notification, the information sent to the device  displays in the device’s notification area or appears in-app. Notifications expand the scope of the  app beyond what’s currently available on the device and deliver a clean way to keep app users  informed of almost anything.  Service workers give web apps some of the same capabilities. In this chapter, I show how to  configure a web app to support notifications plus how to send notifications to subscribed browsers  through a server process. Like the previous one, this chapter is chock-full of code, so let’s get started.  Introducing Push Notifications In web apps, notifications are little pop-up windows browsers display when they receive a notifi- cation message. The web app can send notifications to itself, or you can send them to the browser  from a remote system, usually an app or web server. Notifications appear only when the target  browser is running, but the default browser on many smartphones runs constantly, and Google  Chrome has a setting that users can enable to keep that browser running in the background as  well. Figures 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 show the same notification on Windows, macOS, and Android.  Windows notifications appear at the bottom-left corner of the desktop, while macOS  notifications appear in the upper-right corner of the desktop. On Android, notifications appear  alongside other notifications displayed by the device. If you’re wondering why I’m not saying  anything about iOS, that’s because as I write this, iOS doesn’t support browser notifications.  Figure 6.1  A Browser Notification on Windows   130  Chapter 6  Push Notifications  Figure 6.2  A Browser Notification on macOS  Figure 6.3  A Browser Notification on Android  These are often called push notifications because they’re usually pushed to the browser over a  network connection. I prefer to call them remote notifications because they’re sent from a remote  service. The other type of notification is what I call local notifications, that is, notifications sent to  the browser by the web app running in that browser. You’ll see examples of both in the code we  use later in the chapter.   Introducing Push Notifications  131  Local notifications work only when the web page requesting them is hosted. If you open the page  directly from the file system  rather than using a URL , notifications don’t work.  Remote notifications, however, require service workers to function. For notifications sent by a  remote system, it’s the service worker that processes the notification when it arrives and decides  what to do with it.  Before the browser can receive notifications from a web app or a remote system, the browser user  must first grant permission to authorize the browser to show notifications on behalf of the app. If  the user doesn’t grant permission, you can’t send notifications to the browser.  You’ve probably seen this permissions prompt periodically as you surf the web, sites that  immediately ask for permission to send notifications to your browser before you even know  whether the site contains anything of interest. This approach leads to greatly annoyed users and  causes tweets such as the one shown in Figure 6.4.  Figure 6.4  Twitter Complaint about Push Permission Prompts  Web apps should wait until they’re certain site visitors are interested in receiving notifications  before asking permission to send them. You could gauge interest based on how many pages users  visit or how much time they spend on each, then display the permissions prompt only when  you’re sure they may want them. One option is to use the beforeinstallprompt event discussed  in Chapter 2, “Web App Manifest Files,” to unhide a subscribe button or link. This event only fires  once the browser thinks the visitor has shown real interest in the app. In the app we work on in  this chapter, the code never prompts automatically; it instead provides a button the visitor must  click to subscribe to notifications.  The browser provides several events a web app can listen for to know when the user clicked or  closed the notification window. Notifications can even be interactive; you can provide action  buttons with your notifications and execute specific code depending on which action button the  user clicks or taps. We cover all this and more as we work through the chapter’s code.   132  Chapter 6  Push Notifications  Remote Notification Architecture Before we jump into all the examples and code, let’s talk about how push works. The ability to  send notifications to browsers requires three things:  1.  A browser capable of receiving, processing, and displaying notifications.  2.  An app to send notifications to one or more browsers. This is your app backend.  3.  Some hardware software solution to manage delivering notifications to the   browser—a push service.  The first one probably makes a lot of sense; the forced split between the second and third  requirements causes some confusion.  The browser is a container for running other people’s code, and consequently, there’s risk that  ill-behaved or malicious code could wreak havoc on the user’s system. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  are properly sandboxed by the browser, and there are limits on how they can affect anything  outside of the current app. Service workers change that, of course, but we already talked about the  extra security surrounding them.  Early on, many browser vendors allowed developers to publish extensions that tweaked the inner  workings of the browser, but over the years, browsers became increasingly restrictive in what they  would allow inside the guts of the browser. To deliver a secure environment for notifications,  support for them must be a core component of the browser, available outside of your app’s  context and able to wake up a service worker when necessary.  Sending notifications to browsers must be streamlined as well. Backend apps won’t have direct  connections to the browser, especially when the app is not loaded in the browser. The browser  requests a page, then closes the connection. Yes, I know you could use WebSockets to do this, but  who wants to maintain thousands or millions of socket connections to target browsers? When a  browser has ten or more service workers listening for notifications, do you really want each back- end server maintaining a connection into your browser? No, you really don’t.  So, to make all this possible and minimize the impact on the browser and the computer system or  smartphone running the browser, the push specification uses an intermediate server process to  manage subscription and notification delivery. That server runs somewhere in the cloud and typi- cally comes from the browser vendor. When a web app subscribes to notifications, the browser  knows exactly where to go to register the subscription—to its own cloud push service.  Now that you know why browser push works like it does, let me show you how it works, starting  with the subscription process:   A web app asks the user for permission to display notifications in the browser. Due to the  invasive nature of browser notifications, the notification standard requires user approval  before any notifications can be sent to the browser.   If approved, the web app subscribes the app for notifications through the browser’s push   service.   The push service subscribes the app browser combination, stores the information   somewhere internally, then returns a subscription object that contains everything a  backend app needs to send notifications to this app running on the subscribed browser.   Remote Notification Architecture  133   The subscribing web app sends the subscription object  plus whatever additional   information it thinks is pertinent  to the backend app where it’s stored away for future use  when sending notifications.  The process  except for requesting permission  is highlighted in steps 1 through 3 in Figure 6.5.  Figure 6.5  Browser Push Notification Process  Note To protect the user from rogue notifications, the app backend sends all notification requests in  encrypted format. To do this, the web app generates a set of encryption keys to use in its inter- action with the push service. The web app includes the public key in the subscription request  sent to the push service. When the web app backend server sends notification requests to the push service, it encrypts  the request using the server’s private key. Since the push service has the public key  from the  subscription request , it can decrypt the message and know for certain the request was sent by  the right server.        134  Chapter 6  Push Notifications  When the backend app server has information or data to send to a browser, the server   Encrypts the notification request using the server’s private key.   Sends the request to the push service using the Push API.1   The push service decrypts the request, verifies the identity of the sender, and, if verified,   sends the notification to the target browser.   The browser wakes up the app’s service worker to process the notification.  In this book, I do not cover anything related to implementation of the Push API. It’s an open stan- dard with community-supported libraries, so I’m going to skip all the hard work and use a popular  open source solution for managing delivery of notification requests to a push service. I show how  the server uses the open source solution to send notifications at the end of the chapter.  Preparing to Code The work we do in this chapter revolves around a new app I created for this chapter  styled by  Scott Good, of course . Notifications don’t work unless the web app receiving them is hosted  somewhere  rather than just loaded from the file system , so I included a server process much like  the one used in the previous chapters. The setup process is a little different than what you’ve seen  previously, so don’t skip the instructions here or in the next section.  The code for the server app is available in the book’s GitHub repository at https:  github.com  johnwargo learning-pwa-code. I provided complete instructions for how to download the code  and configure your development environment in the section “Preparing to Code” in Chapter 3,  “Service Workers.” If you haven’t already completed those steps, go there and complete them first  before picking up here again.  Open a terminal window and navigate the terminal into the cloned project’s  \learning-pwa-code\chapter-06\ folder. This folder contains a relatively empty version of  the web app we’ll build out as we work through the chapter. Install all the dependencies required  by the app by executing the following command:  npm install  This command uses the Node Package Manager  npm  to install Node.js modules used by the  server.  Generating Encryption Keys The notification process requires a set of encryption keys: public and private keys used to ensure  the integrity of the notification process. Browser notifications use Voluntary Application Server  Identification  VAPID  for Web Push2 encryption keys to encrypt communication with the  push service. I don’t to go into detail about these keys and how they’re made, as knowing that   1.  https:  www.w3.org TR push-api  2.  https:  datatracker.ietf.org doc rfc8292    Generating Encryption Keys  135  information won’t help you learn push. The push process uses them, so you must have a set of  keys for any web app you create that sends browser notifications.  One of the ways to generate a set of keys is to use the Secure VAPID key generator.3 The server pro- cess included with this chapter’s code uses the popular web-push module4 to manage delivery of  notification requests to the browser cloud service. It includes a function that generates the keys  automatically, so that’s what we’ll use.  Open a terminal window, navigate to the cloned project’s \learning-pwa-code\chapter-06\  folder, and execute the following command:  node generate-keys.js  This executes a little node app I wrote that generates a set of VAPID keys and writes them to  some configuration files used by the web app. The app calls the web-push modules  webpush.generateVAPIDKeys   method, which handles the whole process5 for us.  I mentioned earlier that the client app requires the server’s public key and the server uses the  private key, so the process generates two files. The first is \chapter-06\app\config.ts, which  looks like this:  export const Config = {   GCMAPI_KEY: '',   VAPID_PUBLIC: 'SUPER-SECRET-PUBLIC-KEY',   VAPID_PRIVATE: ' SUPER-SECRET-PRIVATE-KEY ' };  The server uses this file to provide the private encryption key when sending notification messages  through a push service.  The other file is \chapter-06\public\js\config.js, which looks like this:  const Config = {   VAPID_PUBLIC: 'SUPER-SECRET-PUBLIC-KEY', };  The web app uses this file to provide the public encryption key when subscribing to notifications.  Note You don’t have to break your VAPID keys out into separate configuration files as I did here. I did  this because I knew the server source code would be publicly available through the book’s GitHub  repository, and saving the keys to separate files enabled me to omit them from the repository.       As in previous chapters, I coded the server app in TypeScript, so before you can use the server  process with the new configuration file, you must open a terminal window, navigate to the  project folder, and execute the following command:  tsc  3.  https:  tools.reactpwa.com vapid 4.  https:  www.npmjs.com package web-push 5.  You can read about the web-push process at https:  www.npmjs.com package web-pushusage.   136  Chapter 6  Push Notifications  This command invokes the TypeScript compiler, which compiles \chapter-06\app\config.ts  to \chapter-06\config.js. With this in place, we’re ready to go.  You probably noticed that I neglected to explain the GCMAPI_KEY shown in the first file example.  Google provided support for browser notifications long before there was a push standard, and  Google’s implementation used the now-deprecated Google Cloud Messaging  GCM  service.  In this chapter, I’m assuming we’re targeting modern browsers that support the standard; if  your app must support older browsers, you must set up an account in Google’s Firebase Cloud  Messaging  FCM  service and generate the key required to support older browsers the GCMAPI_KEY  mentioned earlier. For more information on this topic, refer to Matt Gaunt’s “What Is the Deal  with GCM, FCM, Web Push and Chrome?”6 at Google’s Web Fundamentals FAQ.  With all the parts in place, it’s time to start the server. In the terminal window, execute the  following command:  npm start  If everything’s set up properly in the code, the server will respond with the following text in the  terminal:  learning-pwa-push@0.0.1 start D:\dev\learning-pwa-code\chapter-06 node . bin www  At this point, you’re all set—the server is up and running and ready to serve content. If you see an  error message, you must dig through any reported errors and resolve them before continuing.  Note The server process for this chapter runs on port 3001, which is different from the server for  previous chapters. I did this because the browser caches resources for you automatically, and  we need a different service worker and associated files for the work we’re doing here. Yes, I know I could provide instructions on how to manually clear the cache and do whatever  other cleanup is required, but since I know both of us will be going forth and back between  this project and earlier ones, I decided to run them on different ports to keep the browser from  getting confused.        To see the web app in its current state, open a browser that supports service workers and  navigate to  http:  localhost:3001  After a short delay, the server should render the simple web page shown in Figure 6.6. The app  doesn’t do anything yet, but we’ll fix that soon. When we’re done, the app will let users subscribe  to notifications, as shown in the figure, and will have a service worker that processes and displays  any remote notifications sent to it through the server.  I created the web app for this chapter using the HTML5 Boilerplate7 template and grabbed a push  icon from https:  icons8.com icon 25175 push-notifications. You’ll see jQuery and other stuff in  the app, but we won’t make use of much of it—it’s just there because of the template.  6.  https:  developers.google.com web fundamentals push-notifications faq 7.  https:  html5boilerplate.com    Generating Encryption Keys  137  Figure 6.6  The Chapter’s Sample Client App  The server also includes an admin app, shown in Figure 6.7. It’s available at http:  localhost:3001  admin; we’ll use it to manage subscriptions  edit and delete them  plus send notifications  to selected browsers. We won’t make any changes to this app; it’s just here to make testing  notifications easier.  Figure 6.7  The Chapter’s Sample Admin App   138  Chapter 6  Push Notifications  Validating Notification Support Some browsers, such as Safari on iOS, don’t support notifications, so before an app does anything  with them, the app must first check to see if notifications are even available in the browser. To do  this, check for the existence of the Notification object using the following:     does the browser support notification? if   "Notification" in window   {      yes! Do something interesting   } else {      no? Then display a warning message      or disable the part of the ui that handles notifications   }  This check is a core component of the updateUI function in the project’s  chapter-06 public js index.js. The web app executes this function to update the UI at  startup and every time the browser’s subscription status changes.  Does your app have to check for notification support before doing anything related to notifications?  No, not really. If you don’t, any code that uses the Notification object will simply fail on browsers  that don’t support notifications.  Checking Notification Permission Once a web app knows the browser supports notifications, it should check whether the user has  granted permission using the Notification object’s permission property, as shown in the  following code:  if  Notification.permission === "granted"  {   console.log 'User has approved notifications' ;   }  The supported permission values are   granted   denied   default  A permission value of ‘granted’ means that the user approved use of notifications for this  app. A permission value of ‘denied’ means the opposite: the user did not grant permission for  notifications for this app. Easy, right?  The ‘default’ value is a weird one as it means that the browser is not sure whether the user approved  notifications. In this case, the browser simply assumes the user has not granted permission. This  happens when the user closes the permissions prompt dialog without making a selection.   Getting Permission for Notifications  139  Getting Permission for Notifications Now that you know how to check that the browser supports notifications and whether the user  has granted permission for notifications, it’s time to get the user’s permission for notifications. To  do this, an app calls the Notification object’s requestPermission method, and the browser  takes over the approval process from there.  The requestPermission method returns a promise; when the promise resolves, it returns a  DOMString containing ‘granted’, ‘denied’, and ‘default’ values described in the previous section.  The following code illustrates the requestPermission method in action. Open the web app  project’s chapter-06\public\js\index.js file and add the code to the existing doSubscribe  function.  Notification.requestPermission  .then result => {   switch  result  {     case 'granted':          the user gave us permission,           so we can go ahead and subscribe         break;     case 'denied':          code block       console.error 'Denied' ;       Swal.fire {         type: 'info',         title: 'Subscribe',         text: 'You denied access to notifications.',         footer: 'Please try again when you are ready.'       } ;       break;     default:          the user closed the permissions dialog          without making a selection       console.warn 'Default' ;       Swal.fire {         type: 'info',         title: 'Subscribe',         text: 'Dialog closed without making a selection.',         footer: 'Please try again later.'       } ;   } } ;  When an app user clicks or taps the Subscribe button, this code requests permission for  notifications, then notifies the user of the result. We’ll do more with this result a little later, but  for now let’s just get this working.   140  Chapter 6  Push Notifications  Note The call to Swal you see in different places in the code refers to SweetAlert2,8 a popular  JavaScript library for displaying cool dialogs in web apps.        I could have checked to see if the user had already granted permission  using the code from the  previous section  before requesting it again, but if the user has already granted permission, the  call to requestPermission simply returns the previous result.  Save the changes to the file, then switch to a browser and open http:  localhost:3001. The  browser should display the page shown in Figure 6.6. If it doesn’t, then go back and check your  code. When it’s working correctly, tap the Subscribe button and you should see the notifications  prompt shown at the top of Figure 6.8.  Figure 6.8  Prompting for Notification Permission  Open the browser’s developer tools, switch to the Console tab, then make a selection in the noti- fications prompt. You should see the permission result written to the console and, in some cases,  dialogs popping up when you don’t allow notifications.  8.  https:  sweetalert2.github.io    Getting Permission for Notifications  141  One of the things that I learned as I worked through the code for this chapter is that browsers are  a little persnickety when you close the notifications prompt without making a selection too many  times. After I closed the prompt a few times, Chrome stopped showing me the prompt at all, and  a quick trip to the console showed me the following:  Notifications permission has been blocked as the user has dismissed the permission  prompt several times. This can be reset in Page Info which can be accessed by clicking the  lock icon next to the URL. See https:  www.chromestatus.com features 6443143280984064  for more information.  Looking at the link provided in the message let me know that Chrome will wait a week before  allowing me to attempt to grant permissions for notifications again. The good news is that this is  easily fixed; following the instructions in the console message, click the information icon to the  left of the URL input field, and change the Notifications option to Ask, as shown in Figure 6.9.  Figure 6.9  Resetting Notification Permissions    142  Chapter 6  Push Notifications  Note You may be asking yourself why I told you to click the information icon when the message  clearly said to click the lock icon. That’s because we’re loading this app from a local server  over an HTTP connection, so the lock icon isn’t there. If this site were hosted on a server and  had a TLS SSL certificate in place, you would see a lock icon there instead.        Local Notifications At this point, when you approve notifications, you can send one to the browser using the  following code:  let theNotification = new Notification 'I read Learning PWA, '   + 'and all I got was this silly notification!' ;  Add that code to the project’s index.js file’s doSubscribe function, in the granted case.  When you reload the page and reset notification permissions  using the trick I showed you in  Figure 6.9 , then click the Subscribe button, you should see something like what is shown in  Figure 6.10 pop up somewhere on the screen.  Figure 6.10  Displaying a Local Notification  You’ve just sent your first notification to a browser. How does it feel?  Notifications can be more robust than I’ve shown here; we’re only passing in a title, which  generates the simple notification you see in the figure. You can also pass in a notification options  object that enables you to create more sophisticated and interactive notifications. I describe these  options in the next section.  The Notification object exposes several events that you can handle in your app:   onclick   onclose   onerror   onshow   To handle them in the app, add the following code to the granted case, immediately following  the definition of the theNotification object.  Local Notifications  143  theNotification.onclick = function  event  {   console.log 'Notification clicked' ;   console.dir event ; };   theNotification.onclose = function  event  {   console.log 'Notification closed' ;   console.dir event ; }   theNotification.onerror = function  event  {   console.error 'Notification error' ;   console.dir event ; }   theNotification.onshow = function  event  {   console.log 'Notification shown' ;   console.dir event ; }  Play around with the different options, making note of the event object in the console output.  Your app can use data in the object to act according to the user’s selection or browser activity.  As fun and exciting as that was, if you try that code on a smartphone, you’ll get the error shown  in Figure 6.11. Showing notifications that way is supported only on desktop browsers.  To display the same notification on both desktop and mobile browsers, you must let the registered  service worker send the local notification for you using the following code:  navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then registration => {   registration.showNotification 'I read Learning PWA, '   'and all I got was this silly notification!' ; } ;  Replace all the notification code  defining the theNotification object and its callbacks  you  added earlier with the service worker–driven version just shown. With this in place, the notifica- tion will work on desktop and mobile browsers. The service worker–compatible version supports  notification events as well; you’ll see them when we work with the service worker later.  The complete code for the project’s index.js file up to this point in the chapter is in the project’s  chapter-06\public\chapter-code\index-61.js file.   144  Chapter 6  Push Notifications  Figure 6.11  Notification Error on an Android Device  Notification Options As I explained in the previous section, what you saw in Figure 6.10 was just a simple notification  using a title string passed to the Notification object’s constructor or, in the second example, to  the registration.showNotification method. The browser is capable of much more.  Note Since using the Notification object is restricted to desktop browsers  today, anyway , I’m  going to ignore that form of notification going forward. The good news is that everything I show  in the rest of the chapter applies to that type of notification, so if you want to use them in your  apps, you can apply the details from this section to it as well.        To take advantage of additional notification options, you must pass an options object to the call  to registration.showNotification, as shown in the following example:   registration.showNotification title, options ;   Notification Options  145  The options object is a simple JavaScript object containing one or more of the following  properties:   actions: An array of items representing the actions the user can perform with this   notification. You’ll see an example of this later.   badge: A URL pointing to an image file used to represent the notification when there isn’t   enough space to display the full notification.   body: The body text for the notification. You’ll seen an example of this in use in a minute.   data: An arbitrary data object associated with the notification. The service worker can use   this data as it processes the notification.   dir: The notification text display direction. This property defaults to auto; additional   options are rtl  right to left  and ltr  left to right .   icon: A URL pointing to an image file displayed in the notification  typically to the left of   the notification on Windows and to the right for macOS .   image: A URL pointing to an image file displayed in the notification  typically above the   notification .   lang: Specifies the language for the notification.   renotify: A Boolean value  true false  specifying whether the browser should notify the   user when a new notification replaces the previous one. This property defaults to false.   requireInteraction: A Boolean value  true false  specifying whether the notification  should remain active until the user clicks or dismisses it. The default value is false, which  directs the browser to close the notification automatically after a few seconds.   tag: A string value identifying the notification. To keep the browser from cluttering up the   user’s system with notifications, when a new notification comes in with the same tag, it  replaces any previous notifications in the queue with the same tag.   vibrate: Specifies a vibration pattern array to use when notifying users of new   notifications. The array contains play pause items specifying number of milliseconds for  each. For example, to vibrate for 200 milliseconds, pausing for 100 milliseconds, repeated  three times, you would use [200, 100, 200, 100, 200, 100].  A more thorough description of these options plus listing of newer options not currently  supported in many browsers can be found in Notification.Notification  .9  Warning Many of the options described here work only on Microsoft Windows. macOS especially, but  Android as well, do not support all the available notification options. I could not get image files  or action buttons to display on anything but Windows. All I can do is hope that these operating systems  notifications are displayed by the OS, not the  browser  continue to add support for other options over time.       9.  https:  developer.mozilla.org en-US docs Web API notification Notification   146  Chapter 6  Push Notifications  Now it’s time to see some of these in action. The following example sets the body text and an icon  for a notification:  let options = {   body: "Isn't this cool?",   icon: " img push-icon-red.png" }; let title = 'I read Learning PWA, and ' +   'all I got was this silly notification!' registration.showNotification title, options ;  When you run this in the browser, you’ll see the notification shown in Figure 6.12.  Figure 6.12  A Notification with a Body and Icon  One of my favorites is to include a random image file along with the notification, as shown in the  following:  You can also include actions for your notifications, as shown in the following example:  let options = {   body: "Isn't this cool?",   image: "https:  picsum.photos 200 100",   icon: " img push-icon-red.png", }; let title = 'I read Learning PWA, and ' +   'all I got was this silly notification!' registration.showNotification title, options ;  This generates the notification shown in Figure 6.13.  let options = {   body: "Isn't this cool?",   image: "https:  picsum.photos 200 100",   icon: " img push-icon-red.png",   actions: [     { action: 'like', title: 'Like' },     { action: 'dislike', title: 'Dislike' }   ] }; let title = 'I read Learning PWA, and ' +   'all I got was this silly notification!' registration.showNotification title, options ;   Notification Options  147  Figure 6.13  A Notification with a Body, Icon, and Random Image  This code generates the notification shown in Figure 6.14.  Figure 6.14  A Notification with a Body, Icon, Random Image, and Actions  Processing the user’s interaction with the action buttons requires some additional code in your  service worker, which I cover when we get to service workers later in the chapter.   148  Chapter 6  Push Notifications  Subscribing to Notifications In this section, we subscribe the browser for notifications with the push server and share the  subscription details with the server so it can send notifications to the browser later. At this  point in the process, we need the server’s VAPID public key, which we put in the project’s  chapter-06\public\js\config.js file earlier in the chapter.  Open the project’s chapter-06\public\index.html file and add the following lines to the  bottom of the file’s body section        This makes the file’s Config object available to the web app.  Next, open the project’s chapter-06\public\js\index.js file and add the following code to  the top of the file  I’ll explain later what it’s used for :  const UUID_KEY = 'subscription-uuid';  With those changes in place, let’s talk through the subscription process and add the required  code to the project’s index.js file. In the following paragraphs, and through the rest of the  chapter, I’ll describe the building blocks we need, then ask you to add complete code blocks to  the project. I apologize if this is confusing; just use the finished files in the project’s  chapter-06\public\chapter-code folder if that helps.  To subscribe the browser for notifications, the web app must execute the  registration.pushManager.subscribe method. Getting access to the registration object  and setting up the parameters for the method takes a bit of work we must do first.  The browser doesn’t have direct access to the registration object, but the app’s service worker  does, so we can get the object through the following:  navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then registration => {   } ;  The subscribe method requires a special set of options defined in the subOptions object:  var subOptions = {   userVisibleOnly: true,   applicationServerKey: urlBase64ToUint8Array Config.VAPID_PUBLIC  };  The userVisibleOnly is the app’s promise to the browser that it will display a notification for  every push item sent to it. There’s only one supported value, and that’s true. The notification  subscription won’t work with any other value assigned to the property.  The applicationServerKey is a specially formatted version of the server’s public key, which we  have available through the Config.VAPID_PUBLIC property in the project’s config.js file. The    function for converting the VAPID public key into the correct format is borrowed directly from  “Using VAPID Key for applicationServerKey”10 and is shown here:  Subscribing to Notifications  149  function urlBase64ToUint8Array base64String  {      this code borrowed from:      https:  www.npmjs.com package web-push   const padding = '='.repeat  4 - base64String.length % 4  % 4 ;   const base64 =  base64String + padding      .replace  - g, '+'      .replace  _ g, ' ' ;     const rawData = window.atob base64 ;   const outputArray = new Uint8Array rawData.length ;     for  let i = 0; i < rawData.length; ++i  {     outputArray[i] = rawData.charCodeAt i ;   }   return outputArray; }  Add the urlBase64ToUint8Array function to the project’s index.js file; we’ll need it in a little  while.  Putting all of this together, the code to subscribe the browser for notifications is the following:  navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then registration => {   var subOptions = {     userVisibleOnly: true,     applicationServerKey: urlBase64ToUint8Array Config.VAPID_PUBLIC    };   registration.pushManager.subscribe subOptions      .then subscription => {       console.log 'Browser subscribed' ;       }    ;  If the browser successfully subscribes for notifications, the push service returns the  subscription object, which looks like this:  {   endpoint: "https:  fcm.googleapis.com fcm send some-unique-id"   expirationTime: null   options: PushSubscriptionOptions   applicationServerKey: ArrayBuffer 65  {}   userVisibleOnly: true }  10.  https:  www.npmjs.com package web-pushusing-vapid-key-for-applicationserverkey   150  Chapter 6  Push Notifications  Remember, we need the subscription object on the server to send notifications to the  browser later, so next we must upload the object to the server. To accommodate this, add the  postRegistration function to the project’s index.js file:  function postRegistration subscription  {   const serverUrl = `${location.origin} api subscribe`;     return new Promise  resolve, reject  => {     if  subscription  {          build the URL to the app's APIs       console.log `Submitting subscription to ${serverUrl}` ;            the data we're passing to the server       const data = {         subscription: subscription,         name: `${platform.name}  ${platform.version} `,         platformName: platform.name,         platformVersion: platform.version,         platformLayout: platform.layout,         platformOS: platform.os,         platformDesc: platform.description       };            POST the data to the server       fetch serverUrl, {         method: 'POST',         headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application json' },         body: JSON.stringify data ,       }          .then response => {           console.log 'Received response from the server' ;           if  response.status == 201  {             console.log 'Subscription submitted' ;             response.json                 .then data => {                 console.log `UUID: ${data.uuid}` ;                 localStorage.setItem UUID_KEY, data.uuid ;                 resolve  ;               }            } else {                tell the user it failed             Swal.fire 'POST Error', response.statusText, 'error' ;             reject response.statusText ;           }         } ;     } else {       reject 'Missing endpoint value' ;     }   } ; }   Subscribing to Notifications  151  This code sends the subscription object to the server along with some additional information  about the browser. You’ll see an example of this data later when we test out the changes. The code  also writes the unique ID for the subscription generated by the server. We’ll store this value in  the app’s local storage  using the UUID_KEY we added to the app earlier  so we have it during the  unsubscribe process.  The final piece of this is how an app checks the status of a subscription. The app may want  to update the UI on the basis of the browser’s subscription status; the code to do this is the  following:  navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then registration => {   console.log 'Checking subscription' ;      check to make sure the browser isn't already subscribed   registration.pushManager.getSubscription       .then subscription => {       if  subscription  {            the browser is subscribed         } else {            the browser is not subscribed         }     } ; } ;  It’s finally time to wrap this section up and add the ability to subscribe to notifications to the web  app. The following code replaces the entire granted case in the existing doSubscribe function  in the app. It’s a slight variation on the subscription code shown earlier; in this case, it checks to  make sure the browser isn’t subscribed before subscribing it. Go ahead and add this code to the  doSubscribe function in the project’s index.js file:  case 'granted':      the user gave us permission,       so go ahead and do the registration   console.log 'Permission granted' ;   navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then registration => {     console.log 'Checking subscription' ;        check to make sure the browser isn't already subscribed     registration.pushManager.getSubscription         .then subscription => {         if  subscription  {           console.log 'Browser is already subscribed' ;           Swal.fire {             type: 'info',             title: 'Subscribe',             text: 'This browser is already subscribed for notifications'           } ;         } else {              subscribe the browser           console.log 'Subscribing the browser' ;           var subOptions = {   152  Chapter 6  Push Notifications              userVisibleOnly: true,             applicationServerKey:               urlBase64ToUint8Array Config.VAPID_PUBLIC            };           registration.pushManager.subscribe subOptions              .then subscription => {               console.log 'Browser subscribed' ;               registration.showNotification 'I read Learning PWA, and ' +                 'all I got was this silly notification!' ;               postRegistration subscription                  .then    => {                   console.log 'Subscription POSTed to server' ;                   updateUI  ;                   Swal.fire {                     type: 'info',                     title: 'Subscribe',                     text: 'The browser was successfully subscribed for   notifications',                      timer: 2000                   } ;                 }                  .catch error => {                   console.error error ;                 }              }              .catch error => {                  hmmm, that didn't work               console.error error ;                  tell the user what we can               Swal.fire {                 type: 'error',                 title: 'Subscribe Error',                 text: error               } ;             } ;         }       } ;     updateUI  ;   } ;   break;  Now that we know how to tell if the browser is subscribed, let’s update the updateUI function  to hide the subscribe button and unhide the unsubscribe button, depending on the browser’s   subscription status:  function updateUI   {   console.log 'updateUI  ' ;      does the browser support notification?   if   "Notification" in window   {         navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then registration => {   Subscribing to Notifications  153           check to make sure the browser isn't already subscribed       registration.pushManager.getSubscription           .then subscription => {           if  subscription  {             console.log 'Browser is already subscribed' ;             document.getElementById "subscribeDiv" .style.display = 'none';             document.getElementById "unsubscribeDiv" .style.display = 'block';           } else {                no? Then unhide the subscribe div             document.getElementById "subscribeDiv" .style.display = 'block';             document.getElementById "unsubscribeDiv" .style.display = 'none';           }         }      } ;   } else {        no? Then display a warning     document.getElementById "noNotificationsWarning" .style.display = 'block';   } }  Go ahead and save your changes and refresh the page in the browser. When you reset the   notification permission  shown in Figure 6.9  and then click the Subscribe button, you should  see the results shown in Figure 6.15.  For this project, I added a timeout value to the call to SweetAlert2 so the dialog closes automati- cally after two seconds, so don’t be surprised if these dialogs start disappearing.  Figure 6.15  Successful Notification Subscription   154  Chapter 6  Push Notifications  The complete code for the project’s index.js file up to this point in the chapter is in the project’s  chapter-06\public\chapter-code\index-62.js file.  Unsubscribing from Notifications Unsubscribing from notifications is much easier than subscribing to them. You still need access  to the registration object, and you must use the registration object to get access to the  subscription object. Once you have that, it’s a simple call to subscription.unsubscribe to  unsubscribe from notifications.  Of course, everything involved uses promises, so the complete code looks like this:  navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then registration => {   registration.pushManager.getSubscription       .then subscription => {       subscription.unsubscribe           .then status => {           if  status  {                successfully unsubscribed             } else {                Failure             }         } ;     } ; } ;  The status value returned from unsubscribe is a Boolean value  true or false  indicating result  of the operation.  For our app, we need a little more than that. We want to tell the user the subscription completed  successfully  or not , plus we must remove the subscription from the server so it knows it can’t  send notifications to this browser again. With that in mind, add the following code to the empty  doUnsubscribe function in the project’s chapter-06\public\js\index.js file.  navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then registration => {   registration.pushManager.getSubscription       .then subscription => {       subscription.unsubscribe           .then status => {           console.log `doUnsubscribe: status: ${status}` ;           if  status  {             updateUI  ;             Swal.fire {               type: 'info',               title: 'Unsubscribe',               text: 'Successfully unsubscribed',               timer: 2000             } ;   Unsubscribing from Notifications  155                 get the UUID from storage             let uuid = localStorage.getItem UUID_KEY ;                do we have a UUID?             if  uuid  {                  build a server URL using it               let serverUrl =                 `${location.origin} api unsubscribe ${uuid}`;                  POST the data to the server               fetch serverUrl, { method: 'POST' }                  .then response => {                   console.log `doUnsubscribe: ${response.status} response` ;                 } ;             }           } else {             Swal.fire {               type: 'error',               title: 'Unsubscribe Error',               text: "I'm not sure what happened here"             } ;           }         } ;     } ; } ;  Save the updated code and refresh the app in the browser. The app should now have an awareness  of subscription status and display the Subscribe or Unsubscribe button depending on the  subscription status. When you click the Unsubscribe button, the app should unsubscribe the  browser and display the notification shown in Figure 6.16.  Figure 6.16  Successful Unsubscribe   156  Chapter 6  Push Notifications  The complete code for the project’s index.js file up to this point in the chapter is in the project’s  chapter-06\public\chapter-code\index-63.js file.  At this point, we’re done with the web app’s index.js file. The web app has the UI we need to  subscribe and unsubscribe the browser for notifications. All that’s left is to set the app up to pro- cess remote notifications sent from the server. This work must be done in the project’s sw.js file.  Remote Notifications The browser delivers push notifications to the service worker to process. The browser fires a spe- cial push event in the service worker whenever the browser receives a remote browser notification   a notification sent by an external app, routed through the push service .  Earlier, when we created the subscription, we promised the browser’s push service that we’d dis- play any notification alert that came from our app’s server. Now it’s time to deliver the code that  does that. In the project’s service worker at chapter-06\public\sw.js, add the following code  to the bottom of the file:  self.addEventListener 'push', event => {     console.log 'SW: Push event fired' ;     console.dir event ;     const data = event.data.json  ;     console.dir data ;     self.registration.showNotification data.title, data ; } ;  This adds an event listener for the push event and contains all the code you need to respond to  notifications sent to the browser by a remote server. When a notification arrives, the code pulls  the title from the notification data included with the push event, then passes the title and  the data object to the showNotification method.  In-Browser Testing The browser’s developer tools give developers an easy way to test their app’s service worker  code for processing browser notifications. In the Push section highlighted in Figure 6.17,  you can enter the content for a push message, then click the Push button to send it. This  delivers the message under the covers; the browser doesn’t know it came from the local  developer tools. When the browser receives the notification, it fires the push event  as expected , and the  service worker’s push event listener executes to process the message. Normally, you would just send a simple text string to the browser using this feature, and the  event listener’s code would just create a generic notification like the first one shown in this  chapter. For our app, the event listener expects a JSON object in the notification payload,  so to make it display the notification using the title plus other options, you must format the  notification string as follows:  {"title": "test", "body": "Test push message from DevTools"}  This is a quick and easy way to test notifications without involving external tools to send the  notification through the browser’s push service.         Remote Notifications  157  Figure 6.17  Browser Developer Tools: Sending Push Messages  If the notification includes an actions array, there’s still one more thing you must do: add an  event listener for the notificationclick event to the sw.js file, which looks like this:  self.addEventListener 'notificationclick', function  event  {   console.log 'SW: Notification clicked' ;   console.dir event ;   if  event.action === 'like'   {     event.waitUntil           do something for the like action        ;   } else {     event.waitUntil           do something for the dislike action        ;   }   } ;  Notice that the event listener uses waitUntil to let the service worker know not to shut down  the event listener until it’s done processing the user’s action click.  The complete code for the project’s sw.js file up to this point in the chapter is in the project’s  chapter-06\public\chapter-code\sw-62.js file.  At this point, the web app is ready to test; I’ll show you two different ways to test the work we’ve  done so far. We’ll start using a third-party developer tool, but also work with the project’s admin  process  accessible through http:  localhost:3001 admin .   158  Chapter 6  Push Notifications  Developers building backend apps like the server used in this chapter need some way to test the  server’s API before they’ve completed building the frontend app that uses the API. They use tools  such as Postman to exercise their APIs as they build them. Download a copy of Postman from  https:  www.getpostman.com  and install it on your development workstation. Launch the app  and create a new API call, as shown in Figure 6.18:  1.  Select GET as the API request method.  2.  Enter http:  localhost:3001 api subscriptions for the API endpoint.  3.  Click the Send button.  With the server running and at least one previous browser subscription completed during our  work in this chapter, you should see a subscriptions list like the one shown in the bottom of  the figure.  Figure 6.18  Displaying Browser Subscriptions Using Postman   Remote Notifications  159  Next, let’s try sending a notification like the ones shown earlier in the chapter. Change the  configuration of the request in Postman, as shown in Figure 6.19.  1.  Start by changing the request type to POST.  2.  Change the request URL to localhost:3001 api send 1. Select the Body tab, select Raw,   and switch the input type to JSON, as shown in the figure.  3.  Populate the Body of the request as shown in the figure.  4.  Click the Send button.  You should see a notification like the one shown in Figure 6.13 with a slightly different icon.  Figure 6.19  Sending a Browser Notification Using Postman  The 1 in the URL refers to the index  represented as idx in the subscription list shown in  Figure 6.18  of the target browser from the database maintained by the server process. As you  subscribe and unsubscribe browsers, that index will change, so make sure you grab the right  value from the subscriptions list before trying to send notifications to browsers.   160  Chapter 6  Push Notifications  Lost Subscriptions One of the things I noticed as I tested the client app used in this chapter was that when  I unregistered the service worker to force loading an updated version, then refreshed the  page, the Unsubscribe button disappeared and was replaced by the Subscribe button. I didn’t  expect that and thought there was a problem with the application logic that hid unhid those  buttons. Remember, subscribing for browser notifications requires service workers, so when I  unregistered the service worker, the browser unsubscribed the browser from the push service.  Unexpected but cool, right? You can prove this by unregistering the service worker, then trying to send a notification to the  browser using Postman. You’ll get a response from the server that looks like this:  {  }       "msg": "push subscription has unsubscribed or expired.\n"     Notice that the content we’re sending the server is a little different than what you saw in previous  examples:  {     "title": "I read Learning PWA, and all I got was this silly notification!",     "body": "Isn't this cool?",     "image": "https:  picsum.photos 200 100",     "icon": " img push-icon-transparent-green.png" }  This is because we’re sending the notification content through the server process and we must  pass that content as a big string value to the server. What we’re sending is a JavaScript object as a  string, so you must put both the keys and values in quotes.  Because I wanted to make it easy for you to test the browser notification process from end to end,  Scott Good and I created an admin client you can use to manage subscriptions on the server and  send notifications to browsers from a simple interface. You can see an example of this app in  Figure 6.7. Open a new tab in the browser and navigate to localhost:3001 admin. You should  see the list of browser registrations you have so far.  Hover your mouse over one of the browsers listed on the page, then select the Notify button that  appears. A popup appears allowing you to edit the content of the notification message, as shown  in Figure 6.20. Click the Send Message button highlighted in the figure to send the message to  the selected browser.  Use the drop-down on the bottom of the form  highlighted in Figure 6.21  to select from canned  notification options available in the app. Click the Reset button when you’ve completed the  selection to copy the selected message content into the editor window.  To adjust the default options, or to add your own, modify the contents of the project’s  chapter-06\public\admin\index.html and chapter-06\public\admin\js\admin.js files.   Remote Notifications  161  Figure 6.20  Sending a Notification Using the Server’s Admin App  Figure 6.21  Selecting Message Content   162  Chapter 6  Push Notifications  Dealing with Subscription Expiration One topic we haven’t covered yet is what happens when the browser’s subscription expires. The  browser push services won’t hold onto these subscriptions forever, so they eventually whack them  and let the browser know. When this happens, the browser fires the pushsubscriptionchange  event to which the service worker can react through an event listener:  self.addEventListener "pushsubscriptionchange", event => {   console.log 'SW: Push Subscription Change event fired' ;   console.dir event ;   event.waitUntil      self.pushManager.subscribe regOptions        .then subscription => {         console.log 'Browser re-subscribed' ;         console.log subscription             now, send the subscription object to the server            just like we did in index.js         }        .catch error => {         console.error error ;       }     ; } ;  In this example, the event listener simply re-subscribes the browser for notifications. In a  real-world application, you would probably want to ask users if they want to subscribe again.   You can add this code to your project’s sw.js file if you want, but none of your subscriptions will  expire as you work through this book.  The complete code for the project’s sw.js file up to this point in the chapter is in the project’s  chapter-06\public\chapter-code\sw-63.js file.  Sending Notifications to Push Services The one thing I haven’t shown you yet is how the server sends notifications to the browser’s push  service. This is all done through code in the project’s chapter-06\app\routes\api.ts file. If  you open the file and look through it, you’ll find the following code at the top of the file:     initialize the Web Push Module    borrowed from https:  www.npmjs.com package web-push if  Config.GCMAPI_KEY  {      if we have a GCM key, use it   webpush.setGCMAPIKey Config.GCMAPI_KEY ;    * in an early implementation of Push  in 2014       Google used Google Cloud Messaging  GCM       before any standards were in place. So      If you're supporting users running    Sending Notifications to Push Services  163       really old browsers, then you'll want to       populate this value in the config file *  } webpush.setVapidDetails    'mailto:john@johnwargo.com',   Config.VAPID_PUBLIC,   Config.VAPID_PRIVATE  ;  This TypeScript code  it doesn’t look much different from JavaScript, does it?  reads values from  the external config.ts file we created earlier and sets the appropriate configuration values in the  web-push module’s configuration. Remember, the server uses the third-party web-push module11  to send notifications through the browser push services, so this code simply initializes that  module.  With module configuration out of the way, the server sends notifications using the  following code:  router.post ' send :idx', function  req: any, res: any, next: any  {      send a notification message   console.log 'Router: POST  send' ;   const pushBody = JSON.stringify req.body ;      convert the parameter to a number   let idx = parseInt req.params.idx, 10 ;      do we have a number in idx?   if  idx && pushBody  {     console.log `Sending notification to Idx: ${idx}` ;     console.log `Payload: ${pushBody}` ;       storage.getItem STORAGE_KEY        .then theResult: any => {         let browsers = theResult ? theResult : [];            get the item from the array at idx         let index = browsers.findIndex function  subscription: any  {           return subscription.idx === idx;         } ;            did we find it?         if  index > -1  {              get the subscriber           let browser = browsers[index];           webpush.sendNotification browser.subscription, pushBody, {}              .then result: any => {               console.log 'Notification sent successfully' ;               res.json result ;             }              .catch result: any => {               console.log 'Notification failure' ;               console.log result ;  11.  https:  www.npmjs.com package web-push   164  Chapter 6  Push Notifications                   does the response have an error code?               if  result.statusCode  {                    then return it to the calling application                 res.status result.statusCode .send { msg: result.body } ;               } else {                    otherwise who knows?                 res.status 500 .send result ;               }             }          } else {           console.log 'Browser not found' ;           res.sendStatus 404 ;         }       }        .catch error: any => {         console.log error ;         res.sendStatus 500 ;       }    } else {     res.sendStatus 400 ;   } } ;  This function handles the POST request highlighted in Figure 6.18; this code   Pulls the browser index off the request’s query string.   Grabs the message content from the request body.   Makes sure it has an index and message content to send.   Tries to retrieve the subscription object for the browser specified in idx. The subscriptions   are stored in a local file using the node-persist module.12   If it has the browser subscription object, it sends it plus the message   content to the browser’s push service through the call to  webpush.sendNotification browser.subscription, pushBody, {} .  The web-push module abstracts away the complexities of the Push API, enabling a server process  to reliably send browser notifications with just a few lines of code.  Wrap-Up Well, this was a big chapter. We covered the complete browser notifications process from web  client permission and subscriptions through notifications and the server process that sends the  notification through the browser’s push service.  The next chapter is the book’s final chapter about service workers. In it, I’ll show how to send data  between a service worker and the web app it services.  12.  https:  www.npmjs.com package node-persist   7 Passing Data between  Service Workers and  Web Applications  Service workers and web apps have a symbiotic relationship on modern browsers that support  service workers; the two work closely together to deliver an improved experience for users. So far,  the only interactions I showed between web apps and service workers are situations in which the  service worker helps the web app, such as by managing resource fetching and processing push  notifications as they arrive. In this chapter, I show how to pass data between a service worker and  a web app running in a browser  desktop or mobile . This data communication goes both ways:  from a service worker to the web app, from a web app to the service worker, or even from the  service worker to all browser tabs running the web app  I show examples of each in this chapter .  As I’ve described throughout this book, the service worker isn’t running all the time: the browser  awakens it only when there’s work for the service worker to do. Therefore, you cannot implement  a full data synchronization solution in a web app using a service worker, as described in Chapter 5,  “Going the Rest of the Way Offline with Background Sync.” We can, however, use event-triggered  actions in a service worker or web app to split processing between the service worker and the app.  A web app, for example, could   Pass data calculation activities off to the service worker to complete.   Let the service worker know when page data changed so it can let other app instances   running in other browser tabs know they need to refresh page content.   Share application state, such as logged-in user or shopping cart data, across browser tabs   through the service worker.  Web developers can already use the window.postMessage method to send messages  between window objects  between a window and a pop-up it created or between different page  components like the page and an iframe embedded in the page . In this chapter, we cover the  serviceWorker.postMessage method that enables similar communication between a  service worker and the web app it serves. We also cover how the MessageChannel object creates  a two-way communication channel that apps can use to streamline communication between a  service worker and the web app it serves.   166  Chapter 7  Passing Data between Service Workers and Web Applications  We build upon the simple push client app we used in Chapter 6, “Push Notifications.” Our task  in this chapter doesn’t relate to push, but the app exhibits certain behavior that lends itself well  to the topics in this chapter. For this topic, I deliberately didn’t try to manufacture contrived app  scenarios because I didn’t want to detract from the core capabilities provided by the browser for  interprocess communication. I leave it up to you to figure out how to apply these capabilities in  your own apps.  Preparing to Code The work we do in this chapter revolves around adding some enhancements to the app used in  the previous chapter. The code for the server app is available in the book’s GitHub repository at  https:  github.com johnwargo learning-pwa-code. I provided complete instructions for how to  download the code and configure your development environment in the section “Preparing to  Code” in Chapter 3, “Service Workers.” If you haven’t already completed those steps, go there and  complete them first before picking up here again.  Open a terminal window and navigate the terminal into the cloned project’s  \learning-pwa-code\chapter-07\ folder. This folder contains the completed version of the  app as of the end of the previous chapter. Install the app’s dependencies by executing the  following command:  npm install  Next, execute the following command:  node generate-keys.js  This executes a little node.js utility I wrote to generate a set of Voluntary Application Server Iden- tification  VAPID  keys and write them to the configuration files used by the web app. The utility  calls the web-push module’s webpush.generateVAPIDKeys   method, which handles the whole  process1 for us.  As in previous chapters, I coded the server app in TypeScript, so before you can use the new  configuration files just created, you must execute the following command to compile the code  into JavaScript:  tsc  npm start  With all the parts in place, it’s time to start the server; in the terminal window, execute the  following command:  If everything’s set up properly in the code, the server will respond with the following text in the  terminal:  learning-pwa-push@0.0.1 start D:\dev\learning-pwa-code\chapter-07 node . bin www  1.  You can read about the process at https:  www.npmjs.com package web-pushusage.   Send Data from a Web App to a Service Worker  167  At this point, you’re all set—the server is up and running and ready to serve content. If you see an  error message, you must dig through any reported errors and resolve them before continuing.  To see the web app in its current state, open Google Chrome or a browser that supports service  workers and navigate to  http:  localhost:3001  After a short delay, the server should render the simple web page shown in Figure 6.6. We’ll add  some extra stuff to the page as we work through this chapter.  Send Data from a Web App to a Service Worker We kick off the coding sections of this chapter highlighting how to send data between a web app  and a service worker. In the sample app from Chapter 6, the state of the browser changes when  the user clicks or taps the Subscribe and Unsubscribe buttons. When that happens, what if the  service worker needed to know this and act in some way with that information? The service  worker’s postMessage method enables an app to do this.  When an app needs to send data to a service worker, it can send the data using the following:  navigator.serviceWorker.controller.postMessage DATA_OBJECT ;  In this example, the DATA_OBJECT object is simply a JavaScript object containing whatever data  the app wants delivered to the service worker.  To see this in action, open the project’s chapter-07\public\js\index.js file, and in the file’s  doSubscribe function, look for the block of code that executes after the browser successfully  subscribes for notifications. There you’ll find the following code:  console.log 'doSubscribe: Browser subscribed' ;  Immediately following that line of code, add the following:     send a message to the service worker letting it know navigator.serviceWorker.controller.postMessage { subscription: true } ;  This code sends a message to the service worker with a data object consisting of the subscription  property with a value of true. This data tells the service worker the notification subscription state  for this browser  true  immediately after the browser subscribes. I show you soon how the service  worker uses this information.  Next, in the file’s doUnsubscribe function, look for the following:  if  status  {  Immediately following that line of code, add     tell the service worker we unsubscribed navigator.serviceWorker.controller.postMessage { subscription: false } ;   168  Chapter 7  Passing Data between Service Workers and Web Applications  This sends the same data object to the service worker with a different subscription property  value  false . This tells the service worker that the browser is no longer subscribed for notifica- tions immediately after the unsubscribe completes.  Note At this point, you may be asking, Why am I going through all of this when the service worker  can check for a subscribed browser using code from Chapter 6? That’s true, but the service  worker doesn’t have a trigger it can use to react to the event. It must rely on the app code  completing the subscribe or unsubscribe process to notify it of the event.        Now that our app informs the service worker when subscription status changes, let’s look at how  the service worker responds to the message. As you probably expect, the arrival of the message  from the web app triggers an event in the service worker. To process the message, the service  worker must register the message event.  Open the project’s chapter-07\public\sw.js file and add the following code to the end  of the file:  self.addEventListener 'message', event => {   console.log 'SW: Message event fired' ;   console.dir event ;   console.log `SW: Subscription status: ${event.data.subscription}` ;      do something interesting with the subscription status   } ;  If you save your changes, open the web app in the browser  http:  localhost:3001 , and click the  Subscribe and Unsubscribe button on the page, you should see output from both the web app and  the service worker in the console as shown in Figure 7.1. The “Browser Subscribed” text is from the  web app’s index.js file, and the items prefaced with SW: come from the service worker.  Figure 7.1  Web App Output from PostMessage  The service worker accesses the content of the data object passed with the message through the  event.data.subscription object. I had you write the event’s event object to the console so  you can inspect it and see what other data elements it exposes for the service worker to use.  Now, I agree that the example provided here isn’t very exciting, but all I’m trying to do is show  the moving parts—how you’ll use this in your app will vary. What I’ve shown is getting data from  the web app to the service worker and the distinct place where that data goes into the service  worker. In the next section, we do something interesting with the data.   Send Data from a Service Worker to a Web App  169  Send Data from a Service Worker to a Web App To send data from a service worker to a web app window, the process is a little more complicated.  Notice that I said web app window instead of web app. That’s because it’s easy for a web app to send  data to a service worker, since there’s only one service worker. On the service worker side, it can  send data to any browser window or browser tab running the web app serviced by the service  worker. Because of that, the service worker must do extra work to figure out which window should  get the message.  Note This is probably a good time to remind you that the browser wakes the service worker to pro- cess the message sent from the web app window. The service worker therefore has a limited  window where it knows about the sender of the message. Once the service worker finishes pro- cessing the message, the browser shuts the service worker down and it forgets everything  it knew about the sender and the message it sent.        The browser maintains a list of the client windows served by the service worker in the service  worker’s clients object. The service worker needs the ID for the sending window to send a mes- sage back to the window. Fortunately, the sending window includes that value in the message  event’s event.source.id property. In its simplest form, the service worker can send a message  back to the sending window using the following code:  self.clients.get event.source.id .then client => {   client.postMessage DATA_OBJECT ; } ;  Knowing the service worker has access to an object storing an array of all the client windows  served by the service worker, a service worker can send a message to every associated browser  window using the following code:  self.clients.matchAll  .then clients => {   clients.forEach client => {     client.postMessage DATA_OBJECT ;   }  } ;  If the browser has copies of the web app open in other windows or tabs, we can use this approach  to reset each window to the correct state when one window subscribes or unsubscribes to  notifications. Open the project’s chapter-07 public sw.js file, and update the service worker  message event listener from the earlier example to the following code:  self.addEventListener 'message', function  event  {   console.log 'SW: Message event fired' ;   console.dir event ;   console.log `Subscription status: ${event.data.subscription}` ;      get all the client windows   self.clients.matchAll  .then clients => {        loop though each window     clients.forEach client => {   170  Chapter 7  Passing Data between Service Workers and Web Applications           send a message to the window       client.postMessage { subscription: event.data.subscription } ;     }    } ; } ;  In this example, the listener uses self.clients.matchAll to build an array of all the client win- dows. It returns a clients object, which we can iterate over using JavaScript’s forEach iterator.  The code sends, to each client window, a simple data object containing the current subscription  status for the app:  { subscription: event.data.subscription }  You could also accomplish the same result using  client.postMessage event.data} ;  For the web app to process the message, we must add a message event listener there. Open the  project’s chapter-07\public\js\index.js file and add the following event listener to the  bottom of the file:  navigator.serviceWorker.addEventListener 'message', event => {   console.log 'Message listener fired' ;   console.dir event ;      do we have a subscription object?   if  typeof event.data.subscription !== 'undefined'  {     console.log `Subscription event: ${event.data.subscription}` ;     updateUI  ;   } }, false ;  This code checks to see if the message event includes the subscription property. If it does, it  logs the subscription status to the console and then calls the app’s updateUI function to refresh  the page. It’s in this function that the app decides whether to enable the Subscribe and Unsub- scribe buttons depending on subscription status. The result of this is that the subscription state  reflected in the button shown by the app synchronizes across all browser windows.  The web app doesn’t use the data passed to it from the service worker because the updateUI func- tion checks subscription status anyway. But there’s no reason the app couldn’t use the data—we  just don’t need it to in this case.  Tip Remember, the data passing affects only windows that are running the service worker in the  current browser  e.g., Chrome . Any browser windows running the app in other browsers at the  same time  e.g., Firefox  won’t be affected.        Looking at that code, it’s clear that there’s one flaw with it. The preceding example sends the mes- sage to all browser windows, but if you think about it, there’s no need to send the message to the  window that triggered the original message to the service worker. Let’s update the code a bit by    Two-Way Communication Using MessageChannel  171  adding a check to see if the window we’re sending to is the same one that sent the original  message. If it is, we skip it and move on to the next one.  self.addEventListener 'message', function  event  {   console.log 'SW: Message event fired' ;   console.dir event ;   console.log `SW: Subscription status: ${event.data.subscription}` ;      get all the client windows   self.clients.matchAll  .then clients => {        loop though each window     clients.forEach client => {       if  client.id === event.source.id  {            is the window the same one that told us about            the subscription event?         console.log `SW: Skipping affected window  ${client.id} ` ;       } else {            send a message to the window         console.log `SW: Notifying ${client.id}` ;         client.postMessage { subscription: event.data.subscription } ;       }     }    } ; } ;  Save all the changes and refresh the app in the browser, then open additional browser windows or  tabs pointing to the web app. When you’re all set, subscribe or unsubscribe one of the windows  and watch what happens in the others.  Pretty cool, right? I know I often have multiple Amazon windows open as I decide what to pur- chase; this approach could easily enable Amazon’s web app to synchronize shopping cart item  count across all browser windows, saving me a refresh to see what the current count is as I switch  windows.  The complete code for these modifications is in the project’s index-71.js and service  worker-71.js files in the project’s chapter-07\public\chapter-code\ folder.  Two-Way Communication Using MessageChannel The browser and service worker also support a two-way communication channel using  postMessage; this approach uses the browser’s MessageChannel2 interface. When you create  a message channel, you essentially create two communications ports: port1 and port2; and  each participant uses one of the ports exclusively to send messages and data to the other.  A message channel was essentially designed to let two parts of a web app  for example, the app’s  main page and an iFrame embedded in it  to create a channel and communicate across it. When  used with service workers, things get a little weird because service workers don’t run all the time— they’re awakened when the browser needs them. Service workers don’t maintain state, so a mes- sage channel is active only until the service worker is shut down by the browser.  2.  https:  developer.mozilla.org en-US docs Web API MessageChannel   172  Chapter 7  Passing Data between Service Workers and Web Applications  Using a message channel in a web app looks like this:  const messageChannel = new MessageChannel  ; messageChannel.port1.onmessage = function  event  {   console.log 'Message received on channel' ;      do something with the message };      send the message to the service worker navigator.serviceWorker.controller.postMessage DATA_OBJECT,   [messageChannel.port2] ;  Start by creating the message channel, then define an event listener for the messages sent to this  side of the channel using port 1. Finally, send a message to the other participant, passing in port 2  as the second parameter to postMessage. It doesn’t matter which side uses which port: all that  matters is that the app uses one for each end of the communication channel and uses that port  exclusively on that end of the conversation.  In the service worker, the message event handler uses the value in event.ports[0] to send a  response back to the web app. The value in event.ports[0] contains the value the web app  passed in the second parameter to the call to postMessage.  self.addEventListener 'message', function  event  {   console.log 'SW: Message event fired' ;   let responsePort = event.ports[0];      send a message back to the web app using    reponsePort.postMessage "Some message" ; } ;  Let me show you the whole process in an example. Open the project’s chapter-07 public  index.html file. Add the following HTML to the bottom of the existing page’s content, before  the script tags:                     Playback Text                  Playback               This adds an input field and a button to the page.  Open the project’s chapter-07\public\js\index.js file then add the following code to the  bottom of the file:  document.getElementById "btnPlayback"    .addEventListener "click", doPlayback ;  This creates a click event listener for the Playback button on the page.   Two-Way Communication Using MessageChannel  173  Finally, add the doPlayback function above the event listener you just added:  function doPlayback   {   console.log 'doPlayback  ' ;      create the new message channel    const messageChannel = new MessageChannel  ;   messageChannel.port1.onmessage = function  event  {     console.log 'Message received on channel' ;     Swal.fire {       type: 'info',       title: 'Message Channel',       text: JSON.stringify event.data      } ;   };      send the message to the service worker   navigator.serviceWorker.controller.postMessage {     action: 'playback',     content: $ 'playbackText' .val     }, [messageChannel.port2] ; }  This function creates the message channel, defines the message event handler for messages  returned across the channel, and sends a message with some data  including the channel’s  port 2—which the service worker will use to send data back to it  to the service worker for  processing. The message sent to the service worker includes the content entered in the input field  we just added.  What we’re going to do next is update the service worker code to process the message when it  arrives, then parrot back the text it received from the web app. It will convert the provided text  into upper case then send it back to the web app across the message channel’s port 2. Back in the  web app, the message event handler grabs the result and displays it in a fancy dialog.  Open the project’s service worker file located in chapter-07\public\sw.js. Refactor the  message event listener so it looks like the following:  self.addEventListener 'message', event => {   console.log 'SW: Message event fired' ;   console.dir event ;      do we have an 'action' message?   if  typeof event.data.action !== 'undefined'  {     console.log 'SW: Action message received' ;     } else {     console.log `SW: Subscription status: ${event.data.subscription}` ;        get all the client windows     self.clients.matchAll  .then clients => {          loop though each window       clients.forEach client => {         if  client.id === event.source.id  {              is the window the same one that told us about   174  Chapter 7  Passing Data between Service Workers and Web Applications               the subscription event?           console.log `SW: Skipping affected window  ${client.id} ` ;         } else {              send a message to the window           console.log `SW: Notifying ${client.id}` ;           client.postMessage { subscription: event.data.subscription } ;         }       }      } ;   } } ;  What you’re doing here is making room for a couple of actions sent through message channels.  In this case, we relegated the existing subscription processing message to the else clause and  added a new check for an action object to the message event handler.  With that in place, we need something to process the actions as they come in. Here’s what we use  to do that:  let theAction = event.data.action; switch  theAction  {   case 'playback':     console.log 'SW: Processing Playback message' ;     event.ports[0].postMessage event.data.content.toUpperCase   ;     break;   default:     console.log 'SW: Unrecognized action  ignored ' ; }  The code pulls the value for the action object from the received message and uses it in a case  statement we’ll add to later. In the solo playback case, it takes the content passed in the message,  converts it to uppercase, and sends it back to the web app. Add that code to the message event  listener inside the if portion of the if then statement, as highlighted in the following code.  Here’s the complete code for the event listener:  self.addEventListener 'message', function  event  {   console.log 'SW: Message event fired' ;   console.dir event ;      do we have an 'action' message?   if  typeof event.data.action !== 'undefined'  {     console.log 'SW: Action message received' ;     let theAction = event.data.action;     switch  theAction  {       case 'playback':         console.log 'SW: Processing Playback message' ;         event.ports[0].postMessage event.data.content.toUpperCase   ;         break;       default:         console.log 'SW: Unrecognized action  ignored ' ;     }   Two-Way Communication Using MessageChannel  175    } else {     console.log `SW: Subscription status: ${event.data.subscription}` ;        get all the client windows     self.clients.matchAll  .then clients => {          loop though each window       clients.forEach client => {         if  client.id === event.source.id  {              is the window the same one that told us about              the subscription event?           console.log `SW: Skipping affected window  ${client.id} ` ;         } else {              send a message to the window           console.log `SW: Notifying ${client.id}` ;           client.postMessage { subscription: event.data.subscription } ;         }       }      } ;   } } ;  Save your changes to both files, refresh the web app in the browser, enter some text in the input  field, and click the Playback button. You’ll see the inputted text returned in uppercase letters, as  shown in Figure 7.2.  Figure 7.2  Playing Text Back through a Service Worker  I agree that this example is a little silly, but I merely wanted to show how to define a communica- tions channel between the two entities. You can use this capability to pass calculations on to the    176  Chapter 7  Passing Data between Service Workers and Web Applications  service worker to perform, or you can even ask the service worker to fetch and process data  from a  local database or server  using this approach.  If your service-worker-side processing will take a little while to complete, remember that you must  wrap it in a waitUntil to keep the browser from shutting down the service worker until the job’s  complete. Let me show you an example of this in action.  In the project’s index.html file, add the following div to the bottom of the  actionsContainer div:       Long Action          When you’re done, the actionsContainer div will look like this:                     Playback Text                  Playback                       Long Action                Next, in the project’s index.js file, add the following code to the bottom of the file  near the  other click event listeners :  document.getElementById "btnLongAction"  .addEventListener "click", doLongAction ;  Finally, add the doLongAction function to the file, somewhere above the event listener you just  added:  function doLongAction   {   console.log 'doLongAction  ' ;      clear any previous content if we have it   $ "longActionOutput" .empty  ;      create a message channel   const messageChannel = new MessageChannel  ;      set up the message listener for the message channel   messageChannel.port1.onmessage = function  event  {     console.log 'Message received on channel' ;   Two-Way Communication Using MessageChannel  177         append content to the page element     $ "longActionOutput" .append ` ${event.data} ` ;   };      send the message to the service worker   navigator.serviceWorker.controller.postMessage      { action: 'longaction' }, [messageChannel.port2] ; }  In the service worker  sw.js , add the following new case to the existing message listener:  case 'longaction':   let limerick = [     'There once was a farmer from Leeds',     'Who swallowed a packet of seeds.',     'It soon came to pass',     'He was covered with grass',     'But has all the tomatoes he needs.'   ]   console.log 'SW: Processing longAction message' ;      do something interesting here   event.waitUntil      new Promise resolve => {          loop around for 5 seconds       let i = 0;       let wait = setInterval    => {            increment the counter         let msg = `${limerick[i]}`         ++i;         event.ports[0].postMessage msg ;            are we done?          if  i > 4  {              shut down the timer           clearInterval wait ;              resolve the promise           resolve  ;         }       }, 1000 ;     }        break;  For the new long action, the event listener wraps a waitUntil around a promise. Inside the  promise, the code sends a limerick back to the page one line at a time, one second apart, until all  five lines have been transmitted and displayed. This is another silly example, but at least you can  see clearly how to create a promise in a waitUntil.  Here’s the complete listing for the service worker’s message listener:  self.addEventListener 'message', function  event  {   178  Chapter 7  Passing Data between Service Workers and Web Applications    console.log 'SW: Message event fired' ;   console.dir event ;      do we have an 'action' message?   if  typeof event.data.action !== 'undefined'  {     console.log 'SW: Action message received' ;     let theAction = event.data.action;     switch  theAction  {       case 'playback':         console.log 'SW: Processing Playback message' ;         event.ports[0].postMessage event.data.content.toUpperCase   ;         break;       case 'longaction':         console.log 'SW: Processing longAction message' ;            do something interesting here         event.waitUntil            new Promise resolve => {                loop around for 5 seconds             let i = 0;             let wait = setInterval    => {                  increment the counter               ++i;               console.log `Loop ${i}` ;               event.ports[0].postMessage i ;                  are we done?                if  i > 4  {                    shut down the timer                 clearInterval wait ;                    resolve the promise                 resolve  ;               }             }, 1000 ;           }                    break;       default:         console.log 'SW: Unrecognized action  ignored ' ;     }   } else {     console.log `SW: Subscription status: ${event.data.subscription}` ;        get all the client windows     self.clients.matchAll  .then clients => {          loop though each window       clients.forEach client => {         if  client.id === event.source.id  {              is the window the same one that told us about              the subscription event?           console.log `SW: Skipping affected window  ${client.id} ` ;         } else {              send a message to the window   Two-Way Communication Using MessageChannel  179            console.log `SW: Notifying ${client.id}` ;           client.postMessage { subscription: event.data.subscription } ;         }       }      } ;   } } ;  Save your changes, refresh the page in the browser, then click the Long Action button. The  browser should respond with the limerick, one line every second, as shown in Figure 7.3.  Figure 7.3  Long Action Results  The complete code for these modifications is in the project’s index-72.js and sw-72.js files in  the project’s chapter-07\public\chapter-code\ folder.   180  Chapter 7  Passing Data between Service Workers and Web Applications  Wrap-Up In this chapter, I showed several ways to pass data between a web app and the service worker  that services it. With this skill, you have a simple way to manage content across multiple browser  windows through a service worker.  This is the last service worker chapter in the book. The remaining chapters deal with the tools  available to PWA developers to make their lives easier.   8 Assessment, Automation,  and Deployment  Throughout this book, we focused on the core capabilities of the browser, and we handcrafted  the manifest files and code that make a PWA a PWA. Now that we’re past all that, it’s time to talk  about available tools to help you build and deploy PWAs.  In this chapter, I show tools from Google that developers use to validate the quality of a PWA,  identifying where an app fulfills PWA requirements and what must be done to make the app a  full-featured PWA. Next, I show some tools from Microsoft that developers can use to convert a  web app into a PWA. The first tool shows you how well you’ve done at delivering your PWA, and  the second tool automates much of the stuff you need to do to create a PWA.  Assessing PWA Quality Using Lighthouse As I described at the beginning of the book, there are different views of what makes a PWA a PWA.  Google tells the story that PWAs are   Reliable   Fast   Engaging  But I argued that there are specific capabilities that define a PWA:   PWAs are installable: mobile and desktop users can install them on their phone’s home   screen or desktop using an installation UI provided in the app.   PWAs cache the app’s core UI on the local device, so when the user opens the app, the UI   loads quickly before the app goes out to get updated data from the network.   PWAs run background tasks, enabling background processing and offline resource caching.   PWAs can receive push notifications from a backend server regardless of whether the app is   running.   182  Chapter 8  Assessment, Automation, and Deployment  To make it easier for developers to deliver PWAs that meet either criteria, Google created Light- house.1 Lighthouse is an open source tool that assesses web apps against Google’s criteria for  PWAs; the good news is that Google’s criteria encompass mine. The tool tests your app, then  delivers a report highlighting what must be fixed to create a complete PWA.  There are three ways to run Lighthouse:   Google Chrome extension   Google Chrome DevTools   Node Module  In the sections that follow, I show you how each approach works plus show some sample reports  from running Lighthouse against two different versions of the Tip Calculator app from Chapter 2,  “Web App Manifest Files.”  Preparing to Code In this chapter, we work with a stripped-down version of the Tip Calculator app, which doesn’t  require a lot of coding for our purposes.  The app in Chapter 2 had a rudimentary service worker but no manifest file, so we built out the  manifest and associated code to make the app installable. In this chapter, there’s no manifest file  or service worker; it’s just a bare bones web app. You can find the app in the cloned project’s  \learning-pwa-code\chapter-08\tip-calc folder.  Assuming you’ve worked along with all the code in the book so far and have all the prerequisites  installed, you’re good to go. If not, please hop over to the Preparing to Code section of Chapter 2  and complete the steps outlined therein before picking back up here.  To use this chapter’s version of the app, open a terminal window or command prompt, navigate  to the project folder, and execute the following command:  http-server  You should then be able to open a web browser, navigate to http:  localhost:8080 index.html,  and see the Tip Calculator we’re so familiar with.  We’re going to use the Chrome browser next, so if you don’t already have it installed, please open  a browser, navigate to https:  www.google.com chrome , and install the latest Chrome version.  Using the Lighthouse Plugin The easiest way to use Lighthouse is through the Lighthouse extension2 Google publishes. To  install the extension,  1.  https:  developers.google.com web tools lighthouse  2.  https:  chrome.google.com webstore detail lighthouse blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk   Preparing to Code  183   Open Chrome or one of the browsers built using Chromium  like Microsoft Edge , and  open the Chrome Web Store  by either opening the Extensions page or searching for it .   Search for the Lighthouse extension in the store.   Click the Add to Chrome button to install the extension in the browser.  With the extension installed, Chrome adds a lighthouse icon to the toolbar, as shown in Figure 8.1.  Figure 8.1   Invoking Lighthouse in Chrome  In the browser, navigate to the Tip Calculator app running in the local server process  started in  Preparing to Code , then click the Lighthouse button.  Note For the screenshot shown in Figure 8.1, I published the app to a GitHub repository, then used  Netlify to host the app for free. I did this as an easy way to get an SSL certificate for my app   to increase my Lighthouse scores for this chapter’s screenshots .         184  Chapter 8  Assessment, Automation, and Deployment  When you click the Options button, Chrome opens a dialog allowing you to set the scope for the  audit performed by the extension, as shown in Figure 8.2. All we care about right now is the PWA  report, so enable the Progressive Web App option and disable all others, then click the OK button  to return to Lighthouse. You can come back later and try out the other options.  Figure 8.2  Lighthouse Options   Click the Generate Report button shown in Figure 8.1, and Chrome opens a new window hosting  the selected web app in a simulated mobile device and exercises the app in different conditions. I  haven’t studied exactly what tests it performs, but you can tell that it’s loading the app with and  without network connectivity and recording what happens in the app. When it completes its  assessment, Chrome opens the page shown in Figure 8.3 listing the results of the audit.  As you can see from the figure, the results are dismal. Remember though, this is the bare bones  version of the Tip Calculator app; it doesn’t have a manifest file or a service worker, so the results  should not be a surprise. Knowing what you know by now about service workers and manifest  files, you should be able to see where these files would bolster the results.  Since I’m hosting the app on Netlify, and they automatically provide an SSL certificate, I get a few  extra points here. For your locally hosted app, this result should be different, although in my test- ing, Lighthouse seemed to incorrectly think I was hosting over an HTTPS connection even when  I wasn’t. This is probably an internal browser hack that enables the browser to run PWAs from  localhost.  It’s a little hard to see, but at the top of the page is the PWA logo I highlighted in Figure 1.1 so  many pages ago. In the report in Figure 8.3, it’s greyed out and hard to see because the app is not a  PWA, and that’s a simple way the extension highlights this fact.   Preparing to Code  185  Figure 8.3  Lighthouse Results for the Basic Tip Calculator App  If you rerun the report against the complete PWA from the end of Chapter 2, you get the happier  results shown in Figure 8.4. Notice that the PWA logo at the top of the report is complete and   colored, plus you have this bold green checkmark proudly proclaiming success.   186  Chapter 8  Assessment, Automation, and Deployment  Figure 8.4  Lighthouse Results for the PWA Version of the Tip Calculator App   Lighthouse offers several output options, shown in the upper-right corner of Figure 8.5. You can  print short or expanded versions of the report or get the report as HTML or JSON.   Preparing to Code  187  Figure 8.5  Lighthouse Report Output Options  The report lets you know what work you need to do to deliver the full PWA version of the selected  app. You may or may not want to do all the work it recommends, but that’s up to you. Lighthouse  is just a quick and simple litmus test for PWAs.  The browser extension is my preferred approach for running Lighthouse, although I expect  that most developers prefer the option outlined in the following section. Generating the report  through the extension delivers the report in a new browser window, making it easy to review and  print for later reference.  Using the Lighthouse Tools in the Browser To make it easier for developers to run Lighthouse during the development process, Google   provides a Lighthouse audit right inside the Chrome DevTools. There’s no extension to install or  any extra setup—it’s just there, ready to go to work.  To access Lighthouse through Chrome DevTools, open a web app in the browser, then open   DevTools and look for the Audits tab, shown in Figure 8.6.   188  Chapter 8  Assessment, Automation, and Deployment  Figure 8.6  Running Lighthouse through Chrome DevTools  Here you have a few more options than what’s available through the extension; you can specify  to test the mobile or desktop version of the app and control how the tools throttle the network   connection during the audit. Select the options that work for your app, then click the Run Audits  button to start the test. When Lighthouse finishes its test, it displays the results in the audit   window shown in Figure 8.7.   Preparing to Code  189  Figure 8.7  Lighthouse Results in Chrome DevTools  From the report page, you have limited options: you can  1  create a new audit, clear  2  the  report, or  3  download the report in JSON format.  Using the Lighthouse Node Module You can also install Lighthouse as a node module and run it from a command-line or in a node  app. To install the module, open a terminal window or command prompt, then execute the   following command:  With the module installed, you can run the report against a site using the following command:  npm install -g lighthouse  lighthouse    In this example,   is the site URL you want to audit. For the book’s public Tip Calculator app,  you would use the following:  lighthouse https:  learningpwa.com tipcalc    190  Chapter 8  Assessment, Automation, and Deployment  The module launches Chrome and performs the same tests you’ve seen before. The only differ- ence is what it does with the results, as shown in the following output:  status Generating results... +1ms Printer html output written to  Users johnwargo learningpwa.com_2019-09-05_07-28-40.  CLI Protip: Run lighthouse with `--view` to immediately open the HTML report in your   report.html +79ms  browser +2ms  ChromeLauncher Killing Chrome instance 54056 +1ms  The Lighthouse module generates its output directly to an .html file in the current folder. If you  want the module to launch the report in the browser immediately after generating it, you must  add the –-view parameter to the command line, as shown in the following example:  lighthouse https:  learningpwa.com tipcalc  --view  Since the module writes its results to the current folder, you must make sure you have write  rights to the folder before running the test. As I tested this for this chapter’s content, I opened  a  command prompt in Windows, switched to the root of my system’s C drive, and executed the  command. When the report completed, I received the following error:  ChromeLauncher Killing Chrome instance 52092 +80ms Runtime error encountered: EPERM: operation not permitted, open  'C:\tip-calc-test.netlify.com_2019-08-31_15-43-46.report.html'  Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, open   'C:\tip-calc-test.netlify.com_2019-08-31_15-43-46.report.html'  This happened because Windows users don’t have access to the root of drive C by default. When  I switched to a folder where I had write permissions, the module worked as expected.  You can also use the module in a node app, and Google provides complete instructions.3 I must  admit that I struggle to find a use case for this; the results you get from running Lighthouse is a  lot of data, and I can’t see the need to write an app that parses and understands the results.  PWABuilder When you’re just getting started building PWAs, Google’s Lighthouse is a great tool to help you  understand what you must do to your app to make it a PWA and validate your work as you do it.  What beginning PWA developers really need is something that helps them do the work to convert  an app into a PWA. To address that need, Microsoft created the open source PWABuilder4 project.  As with Lighthouse, you can use PWABuilder to scan your web site to determine what must be  done to it to make it into a PWA, but PWABuilder takes it a step further and actually gives you the  code you need to convert the web app to a PWA. You can even use PWABuilder to use your PWA to  generate native apps for deployment to Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows devices.  Microsoft also offers a command-line version of PWABuilder that you can use to validate web  app manifest settings and generate apps for deployment to Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows   3.  https:  github.com GoogleChrome lighthouse blob master docs readme.mdusing-programmatically 4.  https:  www.pwabuilder.com    PWABuilder  191  devices. By the time you read this, Microsoft should have released the PWABuilder extension for  Visual Studio Code.  Note PWABuilder started as a Microsoft open source project called ManifoldJS, a framework that  enabled developers to create a manifest file and web app, then use a command-line tool to  generate apps for multiple target platforms. The framework basically took a web app and gener- ated Apache Cordova apps for several target platforms. It created native apps for each target  platform, but the app consisted mainly of the web app running in a native app container.        Using the PWABuilder UI To use PWABuilder, fire up your browser of choice and navigate to https:  pwabuilder.com; the  browser will open the page shown in Figure 8.8. Enter the URL for a publicly available web app  in the input field, then click the Start button to continue. You can use my https:  tip-calc-test. netlify.com  app if you’d like.  Figure 8.8  PWABuilder Home Page   192  Chapter 8  Assessment, Automation, and Deployment  Note The site scanned by PWABuilder must be hosted on a publicly available server, since the   scanner employed by the PWABuilder server must be able to access the site remotely to do its  scan. This is another reason why I hosted this chapter’s Tip Calculator app on Netlify.        The app churns for a little while, then delivers the report shown in Figure 8.9. Here, PWABuilder  highlights the PWA deficiencies for the provided web app. Reading through this report, you  should see that it lists a lot of the same information provided by Lighthouse. What happens next  is what differentiates PWABuilder from Lighthouse.  Figure 8.9  PWABuilder Scan Results  Notice the options on the report page to View Generated Manifest and Choose a Service Worker.  As part of the work it did scanning the app, it built a manifest file using information it gleaned  from the app. PWABuilder also offers a catalog of service workers you can use in your app. I’ll  cover both options in a minute.   PWABuilder  193  If you scroll down the report page, you’ll see a list of options for adding additional features to an  app, shown in Figure 8.10. This links you to a catalog of free code snippets you can use. The snip- pet catalog lists some standard browser capabilities, such as geolocation, copy to clipboard, and  the ability to install a PWA  a topic covered in Chapter 2 , plus some code to interact with several  Microsoft services from Microsoft Graph.  Figure 8.10  PWABuilder Add Features Pane  This version of the Tip Calculator app doesn’t have a manifest file, so PWABuilder generates one  for the app automatically and gives you the ability to tweak it through the web UI. If the app had  a manifest file configured, PWABuilder would let you edit it.  At the top of Figure 8.9 is a Manifest tab; click it and you’ll see the page shown in Figure 8.11.  PWABuilder builds this manifest file using information it’s able to learn about the app by scan- ning its contents. For example, it pulls the values for the manifest file’s name and short_name  properties from the index.html file’s title attribute. For app icons, it pulls in all of the icons  referenced in the index.html file’s icon link elements.   194  Chapter 8  Assessment, Automation, and Deployment  Figure 8.11  PWABuilder Manifest Editor Page  Use the edit fields, shown on the left side of the figure, to change the properties in the manifest  file. You can use the Images and Settings tabs in the editor to tweak other aspects of the manifest,  adding or removing image files, setting the scope for the app, and more.  With all manifest settings in place, use the code areas on the right side of the page to copy the  manifest file and the link to load it over to your web app. The code box in the top-right corner  contains the code you must add to your index.html file’s head section to load the manifest. The  code box in the lower-right corner of the editor contains the actual manifest file content. You  should copy the content, then make a new file in the web app project’s root folder called  manifest.webmanifest and place the copied code there.  This process adds the manifest to the project. To make the app installable, use the code snippet  available by clicking View Snippet, as shown in the lower-left corner of Figure 8.10. What you’ll  find there is pretty much the same code you’ll find in early code examples in Chapter 2.  Next, click on the Service Worker tab, and you’ll see the page shown in Figure 8.12. Here you’ll  find sample code and implementation instructions for many of the caching strategies discussed in    Chapter 4, “Resource Caching.” PWABuilder doesn’t generate anything here specific to your web  app. It just offers some standard options you can copy over into your web app and configure for  your app’s needs.  PWABuilder  195  Figure 8.12  PWABuilder Service Worker Page  When you add the manifest file to the project and implement a service worker, then run the scan  again; you should see different, and hopefully better, results than the ones shown in Figure 8.9. As  you can see, letting PWABuilder help you through the process is much easier than all that coding  we did in earlier chapters of this book.  Creating Deployable Apps Another feature of PWABuilder is its ability to generate starter projects for deployable apps for  Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows, as shown in Figure 8.13. The technologies used to build or  package these apps vary depending on the selected target platform.   196  Chapter 8  Assessment, Automation, and Deployment  For Android, PWABuilder generates a Trusted Web Activities  TWA 5 app, a type of Android app  that enables PWAs to run in a simple app shell on Android devices. For iOS, PWABuilder generates  an Apache Cordova app you can build and deploy to iOS devices. I cover the options for Windows  in PWAs and the Microsoft Store later in the chapter. In my testing, I found that some of the   projects were half-baked and missing complete instructions. My suggestion is that you download  the packages from this page and look at them; perhaps by the time you read this, what’s available  will be more useful.  Figure 8.13  PWABuilder Packaged App Options  5.  https:  developers.google.com web updates 2019 02 using-twa   PWABuilder  197  Using the PWABuilder CLI PWABuilder supports a command-line option as well, and what you get is essentially an updated  version of what was available with the ManifoldJS project many years ago: the ability to generate  deployable apps for multiple target platforms based on a single manifest file.   To install the PWABuilder command-line interface  CLI , open a terminal window or command  prompt and execute the following command:  Next, to generate apps based on the web app at a specific URL, execute the following command:  npm install -g pwabuilder  pwabuilder    Replace   with the full URL pointing to the source web app. For example, to generate apps  for the public Tip Calculator app, you would execute the following command:  pwabuilder https:  learningpwa.com tipcalc   For a locally hosted web app like the ones we created in this book, use the following command:  pwabuilder http:  localhost:3001  The PWABuilder CLI will scan the file and warn you if it finds any issues with the app, as shown  in the top of Figure 8.14. Since it’s generating apps for each target platform, you should fix these  errors before continuing. Next, the tool creates app for multiple target platforms in a folder  named with the short name of the scanned app.  Figure 8.14  PWABuilder CLI Output and Results  You can open the newly created folder and read through the instructions provided with each   target platform to build and deploy apps for each.   198  Chapter 8  Assessment, Automation, and Deployment  PWABuilder and Visual Studio Right after I finished this chapter, Microsoft released a preview version of the PWABuilder   extension for Visual Studio Code. It’s still in preview, so I don’t know exactly how this will work  when it’s released, but I can at least show you how it works today and hope it’s not too much   different in its final form.  To get the extension, open Visual Studio Code and then open the extensions pane, as shown  in Figure 8.15. Type pwabuilder in the search field, as shown in the figure, and you should see  the extension appear. Click the Install button to add the extension to your Visual Studio Code  installation.  Figure 8.15  Visual Studio Code: PWABuilder Extension  With the extension in place, open a web app project in Visual Studio Code, then open the   command palette, as shown in Figure 8.16. Type pwa, and the command dropdown should show  the available options for PWABuilder, as shown in the figure.   PWABuilder  199  Figure 8.16  Visual Studio Code Command Palette  Right now, the only available options are to generate a manifest file or generate a service worker  for the selected app project. Since it’s PWABuilder under the covers, what happens next shouldn’t  be a surprise. If you select Generate Manifest, Visual Studio Code opens the Manifest Generator  page, shown in Figure 8.17.   200  Chapter 8  Assessment, Automation, and Deployment  Figure 8.17  Visual Studio Code: PWABuilder Manifest Generator  Populate the form with the same options discussed earlier in the chapter, selecting an icon for  the app as well as providing additional settings for the manifest file. When you’re done, click the  Generate button on the bottom of the form. At this point, Visual Studio Code prompts you to  select the target folder for the manifest, which should be the root folder of the app. When you  make your selection, the extension saves the manifest file in a file called manifest.json, then  opens the file for editing, as shown in Figure 8.18.   PWABuilder  201  Figure 8.18  Visual Studio Code: PWABuilder Generated Manifest File  The extension doesn’t update your project’s index.html file to use the manifest, so at this point,  you should open that file and add the following line to the   section of the file:     Save your changes to the file, and your app has the first requirement of an installable PWA: a  manifest file.  Adding a service worker to your project follows the same process: open the command palette,  type pwa, then select Generate Service Worker. When you select this option, you’ll see the screen  shown in Figure 8.19. In this case, the extension isn’t generating a service worker for your project,  it’s merely displaying the same service worker options you saw in Figure 8.12.   202  Chapter 8  Assessment, Automation, and Deployment  Figure 8.19  Visual Studio Code: PWABuilder Options  Follow the instructions on the page to update your project’s landing page  typically the project’s  index.html file  with the code necessary to load a service worker, then select the service worker  you want to use and add it to the project as well.  PWAs and the Microsoft Store On the Microsoft Windows platform, Microsoft took a unique approach and announced that it  would scan the Internet for PWAs and automatically add them to the Microsoft Store. What this  means is that Microsoft Windows customers now have a searchable database of PWAs they can  install.   PWAs and the Microsoft Store  203  The process is automatic, but you can opt out if you don’t want your app in the store. To do so,  add a robots.txt file to the root folder of the app  if one doesn’t already exist  and add the   following to the file:  User-agent: bingbot Disallow:  manifest.json  This tells Bing to ignore the app’s manifest for PWA indexing purposes.  You can also package your PWA and deploy it to the Microsoft Store in several ways. One way is  through the Windows option shown in Figure 8.12. When you click the Download icon on the  Windows section in that figure, PWABuilder displays the dialog shown in Figure 8.20. When  you click the Download button, you get a zip file you can use to create a package you can submit  to the Microsoft Store. Just download the file, extract the contents to a folder, and follow the   instructions in the extracted file’s projects\windows10\Windows10-next-steps.md file.  Figure 8.20  PWABuilder Windows App Options  When you click the Generate button, PWABuilder opens the dialog shown in Figure 8.21.   Populate the form with the appropriate values from your Microsoft Dev Center account, and  PWABuilder will generate the package you need to deploy this app through the Microsoft Store.   204  Chapter 8  Assessment, Automation, and Deployment  Figure 8.21  PWABuilder Generate Windows Store AppX Package  A third option involves using Visual Studio to package the app for deployment manually. Visual  Studio 2017 included a special project type for Progressive Web Apps, as shown in Figure 8.22.  When you create a project using this project type, you can add your PWA files to the project and  package it for deployment using the instructions in Progressive Web Apps in the Microsoft Store.6  6.  https:  docs.microsoft.com en-us microsoft-edge progressive-web-apps microsoft-store   Wrap-Up  205  Figure 8.22  Visual Studio PWA Project  Warning This capability is available only in Visual Studio 2017; Microsoft dropped the Windows  JavaScript project type in Visual Studio 2019.        Wrap-Up In this chapter, I showed you some of the tools available to web developers to help them deliver  better PWAs. When you’re just starting out, these tools help kickstart your efforts and help you get  the job done. I also showed how to use PWABuilder to help you build deployable versions of your  PWAs.  In the next, and final, chapter, I’ll show you another tool from Google called Workbox7 that  automates adding offline support to web apps.  7.  https:  developers.google.com web tools workbox    This page intentionally left blank    9 Automating Service Workers  with Google Workbox  In Chapter 4, “Resource Caching,” we wrote a lot of code to implement different caching strate- gies for the PWA News app. You probably completed that chapter and said something along the  lines of “there’s got to be a better way.” Well, there is. With Google Workbox,1 Google, along with  the PWA developer community, provides a toolkit developers can use to more easily deliver robust  and capable service workers. I’d like to say that you’re writing less code with Workbox, but that’s  not the case. You’re still writing code, but you’re writing code that describes how you want your  service worker to work rather than the code to actually make it work.  In this chapter, I introduce you to Workbox and show you how you can use it to implement  caching strategies for your web apps. I don’t cover every capability of Workbox; the library  documentation is good, thorough, and full of examples. What I’ll show here is how to apply  Workbox to an app, using the Tip Calculator app from the beginning of the book.  In the source code for this chapter, I included a slightly modified version of the Tip Calculator  used in Chapter 2, “Web App Manifest Files.” Rather than start with a clean project and enhance  it as you work through the chapter, in this chapter, you’ll copy the clean version and work in a  copy as you proceed through the different sections.  Introducing Workbox Workbox is a service worker toolbox consisting of JavaScript libraries, a Node command-line  interface  CLI , and Node modules developers use to create service workers and manage how  they work. The JavaScript libraries deliver the service worker–side capabilities of the toolbox,  something Google describes as “adding offline support to web apps.” The CLI and Node modules  automate app resource precaching during the coding and build process.  With Workbox, you can build a service worker that   Precaches the resources used by a web app and serves them from the cache.   Implements multiple caching strategies for your web app’s resources.  1.  https:  developers.google.com web tools workbox    208  Chapter 9  Automating Service Workers with Google Workbox   Implements offline capabilities for Google Analytics.   Queues network requests for later processing using background sync  similar to what you   learned in Chapter 5, “Going the Rest of the Way Offline with Background Sync” .   Programmatically sets expiration for cached resources.   Does all sorts of other stuff.  Workbox abstracts away the complexity of the work that service workers do, letting you describe  how you want things to work, and the toolbox handles everything else for you.  In this chapter’s examples, I show you how to use the CLI and the JavaScript framework in your  PWAs. I leave working with the Node module and build tools for you to research later. Everything  you learn in this chapter easily applies to those other topics as well.  Generating a Precaching Service Worker With precaching and service workers, you build a list of all the local file resources used by your  app, then use code to preload those resources into a device’s local cache the first time the app  runs on the device; we implemented an example of this in Listing 4.1. In Workbox, Google  delivers tools that automate generating that file list plus generating the service worker that caches  the files and serves them from the cache.  Start by making a copy of the project’s chapter-09 tip-calc folder. Copy the folder, then paste  it back to the same location, renaming the folder copy to tc1 during the process. When you’re  done, you’ll have two folders in the chapter-09 folder: tip-calc and tc1.  Next, open a terminal window or command prompt, navigate into the tc1 folder, and execute the  following command:  This command installs the Workbox CLI for us to use. After the installation completes, execute  the following command:  npm install –g workbox-cli  workbox wizard  This starts the process Workbox uses to generate the resource list and service worker for your  PWA. The wizard will ask you a few questions, then create the configuration file that drives the  precaching and service worker generation process. Figure 9.1 shows the first step in the process.  The wizard assumes you have a folder structure with a source and distribution folder  or some  variant , so the first thing it does is ask for the location of the app’s source files. For this simple  project, everything is in the tc1 folder, so select Manually enter the path, as highlighted in the  figure, then press Enter.  The wizard then requests the following:  ? Please enter the path to the root of your web app:   Generating a Precaching Service Worker  209  Figure 9.1  Workbox Wizard Starting Up  Enter a single period  . , then press Enter. The period indicates the current folder  make sure  you’re in the tc1 folder when you start the wizard .  Next, the wizard asks you to select the subfolders containing resources that require precaching:  ? Which file types would you like to precache?  Press   to select,   to   toggle all,   to invert selection   > *  css   *  png   *  ico   *  html   *  js   *  md   *  svg  The wizard selects all folders by default, so for this project just press Enter to accept the defaults. If  you want to omit a folder, use the arrow keys to move up or down the list, then press the a key to  toggle the selected folder or i to invert the current selections.  Next, the wizard asks for the file name for the generated service worker file. In this project, I’ve  already configured the code that registers the service worker  in  js sw-reg.js  to look for  the service worker in a file called sw.js, so you can just press Enter to accept the default value  provided.  ? Where would you like your service worker file to be saved?  sw.js   Note If you change this value to a different file name, be sure to update the sw-reg.js file to use  the new service worker file name.         210  Chapter 9  Automating Service Workers with Google Workbox  Finally, the wizard asks for the file name for the configuration file used by Workbox to store the  settings you just provided. Press Enter to accept the default  workbox-config.js .  ? Where would you like to save these configuration options?  workbox-config.js   Note The Workbox CLI assumes this file name for related CLI commands, so if you change this value  from the default, you must provide the file name in every CLI command that uses this file. For  that reason, it’s probably best to just leave it at the default value.        When you press Enter, the Workbox CLI writes the configuration values you provided to the  configuration file you specified in the last step. At the conclusion of the process, the CLI outputs  the following message:  To build your service worker, run     workbox generateSW workbox-config.js   as part of a build process. See https:  goo.gl fdTQBf for details. You can further customize your service worker by making changes to workbox-config.js.   See https:  goo.gl 8bs14N for details.  At this point, all you have is the Workbox configuration file shown in Listing 9.1. Nothing’s been  done to generate the service worker file we need for this app; we’ll do that next.  Listing 9.1  Workbox Configuration File: workbox-config.js  module.exports = {   "globDirectory": ".",   "globPatterns": [     "** *.{css,png,ico,html,js,svg}"   ],   "swDest": "sw.js" };  In the terminal window, execute the following command:  workbox generateSW workbox-config.js  This launches the Workbox process that generates the service worker file specified in the  configuration file. Since we used the default configuration file name, you can simplify things and  execute the following instead:  workbox generateSW  At this point, Workbox scans the selected source code folders, then generates the service  worker shown in Listing 9.2  redacted to show only the first and last resources in the precache  manifest array .   Generating a Precaching Service Worker  211  Listing 9.2  Workbox Generated sw.js File in tc1   **  * Welcome to your Workbox-powered service worker!  *  * you'll need to register this file in your web app, and you should  * disable HTTP caching for this file too.  * see https:  goo.gl nhQhGp  *  * the rest of the code is auto-generated.

Workbox uses this hash to determine when the  file changes so it can update the cache.  At the end of the generated file is the following code:  workbox.precaching.precacheAndRoute self.__precacheManifest, {} ;  This code initiates resource precaching and instructs the Workbox JavaScript library to serve  resources from the cache. That’s it; that’s a complete precaching service worker using Workbox.  Switch back to the terminal window and start the local web server we used in Chapter 2 by  executing the following command:  http-server  Open a browser and point it to http:  localhost:8080 index.html; the browser will show the page  you’ve already seen from Figure 2.1. Nothing has changed in the UI; what’s different is under  the covers. Open the browser’s developer tools panel and look at the console. You should see the  output shown in Figure 9.2.  Figure 9.2  Workbox Precaching Tip Calculator Files  Our generated service worker cached 40 files, and those resources are cached and ready to enable  the browser to run the app offline. To test it, turn off the network, reload the app, and look at the  console output. You’ll see output indicating the service worker serving resource files from cache,  as shown in Figure 9.3.   Generating a Precaching Service Worker  213  Figure 9.3  Chrome DevTools Error: Missing Service Worker File  When you look at the local cache, there are some extra files in the cached file list that we know  we’ll never need, such as the sw-start.js and workbox-config.js files. Fortunately for us,  there’s a solution. The workbox-config.js file supports a globIgnores property you can use to  list the files or file specifications for files you want ignored during the cache manifest generation  process. To omit those two files, add the following property to the workbox-config.js file:  "globIgnores": [   '** sw-start.js',   '** workbox-config.js' ],  You’ll find the complete contents for the file in Listing 9.3.  Listing 9.3  Workbox Configuration File: workbox-config.js in tc1  module.exports = {   "globDirectory": ".",   "globPatterns": [     "** *.{css,png,ico,html,js,svg}"   ],   "globIgnores": [     '** sw-start.js',     '** workbox-config.js'   ],   "swDest": "sw.js" };  Figure 9.3 shows a few errors as well, so apparently not everything the app needs is cached  correctly.   214  Chapter 9  Automating Service Workers with Google Workbox  The last error in the list doesn’t tell you much about its cause; the browser generates that error  when it attempts to load the service worker file as it loads the page. If you look at the precache  array, you’ll see that the service worker isn’t listed. As you probably remember from Chapter 3,  “Service Workers,” the browser loads the service worker with every page load to check whether  there’s a new version to install. Since Workbox omits the service worker, you get this error.  I got around this error in Chapter 3 when I included the service worker in the list of cached files.  You don’t need to include your service worker in the cache. If it’s not there, the browser generates  an error and continues. To help me learn more about how Workbox works, and to avoid the error,  I set about trying to figure out how to include the service worker in the cache  just for fun .  Since we’re using Workbox to generate the service worker, I don’t want to manually add the file to  the precache array because Workbox will overwrite it whenever I generate the file.  I thought a possible solution existed in the workbox-config.js file. Open the file and look for  the following:  This is the file specification that tells Workbox how to identify files we want precached. I tried  adding the service worker to the list of precached files by adding the following entry to the  globPatterns array:  "globPatterns": [   "** *.{css,png,ico,html,js,svg}" ],  ". sw.js"  Here’s the complete array definition:  "globPatterns": [   "** *.{css,png,ico,html,js,svg}",   ". sw.js" ],  When I regenerated the service worker and tested it in the browser, Workbox dutifully added  the service worker to the cache as instructed, but the browser still reported the same error.  Apparently, Workbox can’t handle caching its own service worker. Sorry.  I’m going to ask you to ignore the other errors for now; I’ll cover them in “Controlling Caching”  Strategies later in the chapter.  As you can see, for simple static sites, this approach generates a service worker in no time and  immediately improves the offline performance of the site. Unfortunately, it caches everything for  the site, even if it’s not used  like many of the icon files I have in the app .  You can also use the Workbox NodeJS module and Webpack plugin to generate or update the  service worker in your project at build time. Since the focus of this book is service workers and  PWAs, I’m going leave the details of that for your future research.2   2.   You can learn more about this topic at https:  developers.google.com web tools workbox modules   workbox-build.   Add Precaching to an Existing Service Worker  215  Add Precaching to an Existing Service Worker Many developers want more control over their app’s service worker, so Workbox supports a  workflow for that use case as well. With this approach, you make some simple changes to a service  worker, then use the Workbox CLI to populate the resource array you saw in the previous section.  With the resource list in place, you add code to the service worker to enable the appropriate  caching strategies for your app’s resource types.  To get started, make another copy  our second  of the project’s chapter-09 tip-calc folder,  and call this version tc2. If, for some reason, you didn’t complete the Node module installation  in the previous section, open a terminal window, navigate to the new tc2 folder, then execute the  following command:  npm install –g workbox-cli  The chapter’s sample project includes a simple service worker in a file called sw-start.js. Open  that file now in the tc2 folder and add the following lines of code to the top of the file:  importScripts 'https:  storage.googleapis.com workbox-cdn releases 4.3.1   workbox-sw.js' ;    workbox.precaching.precacheAndRoute [] ;  This adds the Workbox library to the service worker and a placeholder for the resource array you  saw in the previous section.  In the same terminal window, execute the following command:  workbox wizard –injectManifest  This runs the Workbox Wizard, as we did in the previous section, enabling a mode that instructs  the CLI that it must prepare its configuration file to update an existing service worker rather than  generate a new one. The wizard works the same way we saw in the previous section with only one  additional change.  The wizard starts by asking for the app’s source code folder:  ? Please enter the path to the root of your web app:  Enter a single period  . , then press Enter. The period indicates the current folder  make sure  you’re in the tc2 folder .  Next, the wizard asks you to select the subfolders containing resources that require precaching:  ? Which file types would you like to precache?  Press   to select,   to   toggle all,   to invert selection   > *  css   *  png   *  ico   *  html   *  js   *  md   *  svg   216  Chapter 9  Automating Service Workers with Google Workbox  At this point, the wizard asks for the existing service worker file you want updated with the  resource array:  ? Where's your existing service worker file? To be used with injectManifest, it   should include a call to 'workbox.precaching.precacheAndRoute [] '  Enter sw-start.js and press Enter.  Next, the wizard asks for the file name for the generated service worker file. In this project, I’ve  already configured the software that registers the service worker   js sw-reg.js  to look for the  service worker in a file called sw.js, so you can just press Enter to accept the default value.  ? Where would you like your service worker file to be saved?  sw.js   Note If you change this value to a different file name, be sure to update the sw-reg.js file to use  the new service worker file name.     Finally, the wizard asks for the file name for the configuration file used by Workbox to store the  settings you just entered or selected. Press Enter to accept the default  workbox-config.js .  ? Where would you like to save these configuration options?  workbox-config.js   Note The Workbox CLI assumes this file name for related CLI commands, so if you change this value  from the default, you must provide the file name in every CLI command that uses this file. For  that reason, it’s probably best to just leave it at the default value.           When you press Enter, the Workbox CLI writes the configuration values you provided to the  configuration file you specified in the last step. At the conclusion of the process, the CLI outputs  the following message:  To build your service worker, run     workbox injectManifest workbox-config.js   as part of a build process. See https:  goo.gl fdTQBf for details. You can further customize your service worker by making changes to   workbox-config.js. See https:  goo.gl 8bs14N for details.  At this point, all you did is create the Workbox configuration file shown in Listing 9.4.   Listing 9.4  Workbox Configuration File: workbox-config.js in tc2  module.exports = {   "globDirectory": ".",   "globPatterns": [     "** *.{css,png,ico,html,js,svg}"   ],   Add Precaching to an Existing Service Worker  217    "swDest": "sw.js",   "swSrc": "sw-start.js" };  For the most part, the configuration file has a lot of the same settings from the previous section.  What’s new is the swSrc property, which tells Workbox what file to use as the base for the  updated service worker.  In the terminal window, execute the following command:  workbox injectManifest  This command kicks off the resource manifest generation we saw in the previous section.  Remember, we selected the default configuration file name, so we don’t have to pass its file name  on the command line here.   In this case, it updates the existing service worker shown in Listing 9.5  redacted to show only the  first and last resources in the precache manifest array .  Listing 9.5  Workbox Generated sw.js File in tc2  self.addEventListener 'install', event => {      fires when the browser installs the app      here we're just logging the event and the contents      of the object passed to the event. the purpose of this event      is to give the service worker a place to setup the local       environment after the installation completes.   console.log `Event fired: ${event.type}` ;   console.dir event ; } ;   self.addEventListener 'activate', event => {      fires after the service worker completes its installation.       it's a place for the service worker to clean up from previous       service worker versions   console.log `Event fired: ${event.type}` ;   console.dir event ; } ;   importScripts 'https:  storage.googleapis.com workbox-cdn releases 4.3.1   workbox-sw.js' ;    workbox.precaching.precacheAndRoute [   {     "url": "css main.css",     "revision": "50c72ce0e72508baa767491be65455cd"   },     218  Chapter 9  Automating Service Workers with Google Workbox       redacted: MORE RESOURCE FILES HERE     {     "url": "safari-pinned-tab.svg",     "revision": "7a812aea31a92da37ba82be39fa3084a"   } ] ;  When you load this version of the Tip Calculator app in the browser, you should see the same  results from the previous section. The only difference between the two is that we provided the  starter service worker file for this version.  You can also use the Workbox Node module and Webpack plugin to generate or update the  service worker in your project at build time. Since the focus of this book is service workers and  PWAs, I’m going to leave the details of that for your future research.3  Controlling Cache Strategies Many developers want more control over what’s cached by the service worker and how the service  worker caches the resources. If you look at the cache from one of the examples from the previous  sections, shown in Figure 9.4, you’ll see that the app cached all application icons even though the  app doesn’t need all of them on this browser.  Figure 9.4  Tip Calculator Precached Files  3.   You can learn more about this topic at https:  developers.google.com web tools workbox   modules workbox-build.   Controlling Cache Strategies  219  When we skip the whole precaching process, we can build a service worker that uses Workbox  to implement caching strategies for only the app resources needed by the app. Before I show you  how to do that, I must first cover the different caching strategies available through Workbox. Here  we go!  Workbox provides support for the following caching strategies:   CacheFirst: Return the cached version of a resource, retrieving the resource from the   network  and adding it to the cache  if it’s not already in the cache.   CacheOnly: Return the resource from the cache. If the resource is not in the cache,   the fetch will fail. Your service worker must populate the cache during service worker  installation to enable this option.   NetworkFirst: Return the network version of the resource, retrieving the resource from  the cache if the network is not available. The fetch fails when the network version is not  available and the resource is not in the cache.   NetworkOnly: Return the network version of the resource, failing if it’s not available.   StaleWhileRevalidate: Return the cached version of a resource, then update the cached  version from the network so it’s there the next time the app requests the resource. This gets  resources to an app quickly, but it may not always be the most recent version.  To use a caching strategy when a web app requests resources, register a route to the resource using  the following code:  workbox.routing.registerRoute  match, handler  ;  In this example, the match parameter refers to one of the following options used to match the  requested resource with this route:   Callback function   Regular expression   String  Let’s see all of this in action.  The handler parameter refers to one of the caching strategies listed earlier in this section.  For the callback option, you provide a function Workbox executes to determine whether the  requested resource matches the selection criteria for this route. Here’s an example:  const matchX =  { url, event }  => {     return url.href.includes 'x' ; };   workbox.routing.registerRoute    matchX,   new workbox.strategies.StaleWhileRevalidate    ;   220  Chapter 9  Automating Service Workers with Google Workbox  In this example, the route matches the request URL if the full URL to the requested resource  contains an x. If it does, the service worker uses the StaleWhileRevalidate strategy for the  resource. If not, this resource is ignored and hopefully picked up by some other route.  You can match resources using a regular expression, as shown in the following example:  workbox.routing.registerRoute     \. ?:html $ ,   new workbox.strategies.NetworkFirst  ,  ;  In this example, the regular expression in the first parameter matches any file that has .html  in the resource path. When the app requests an HTML file, the service worker will return the  resource using the NetworkFirst strategy.  You can also use different caching strategies for different types of files. For example, the following  code uses the StaleWhileRevalidate strategy for .js and .css files, but NetworkFirst  for .html files:  workbox.routing.registerRoute     \. ?:jscss $ ,   new workbox.strategies.StaleWhileRevalidate  ,  ;   workbox.routing.registerRoute     \. ?:html $ ,   new workbox.strategies.NetworkFirst  ,  ;  workbox.routing.registerRoute    ' img my-logo.png',   new workbox.strategies.CacheFirst  ,  ;  Finally, you can match resources using a string value, as shown in the following example:  In this example, the route matches if the requested resource is the app’s  img my-logo.png  file. When the app requests the logo file, the service worker will return the resource using the  CacheFirst strategy.  Let’s add some caching to the Tip Calculator app. Make another copy of the project’s  chapter-09 tip-calc folder, and call this version tc3. Next, rename the copied project’s  sw-start.js file to sw.js and open the renamed file in your code editor.  importScripts 'https:  storage.googleapis.com workbox-cdn releases 4.3.1   At the top of the file, add the following import:  workbox-sw.js' ;  This adds the Workbox library to the app.   Controlling Cache Strategies  221  Next, at the bottom of the file, add the following code:  workbox.routing.registerRoute     \. ?:pngsvgjscsshtml $ ,   new workbox.strategies.StaleWhileRevalidate    ;  This uses a regular expression to apply the StaleWhileRevalidate caching strategy to all  .png, .svg, .js, .css, and .html files for the app. This is a simple but effective approach to  caching app resources and should cover most web app resource types.  If you have other file types in your web app, you can add the resource’s file extension to the  regular expression.  When you load the app in the browser and look at its cache storage, as shown in Figure 9.5, you’ll  see that all matching file types are cached.  Figure 9.5  Workbox Cache in Action  To see the caching strategy in action, disable the network in the browser developer tools, then  look at the results in the Network panel, shown in Figure 9.6. As you can see from the figure, the  service worker returns the requested resource if it has it, then the fetchWrapper.mjs file tries to  retrieve an updated version of the file from the network  and fails .   222  Chapter 9  Automating Service Workers with Google Workbox  Figure 9.6  Workbox Caching Shown through Developer Tools Network Panel  Workbox supports plugins as well, and there are many available for you to use. For example,  there’s an expiration plugin you can use to keep resources in a cache for a specific number of  seconds:  workbox.routing.registerRoute     \. ?:pngjpgsvg $ ,   new workbox.strategies.CacheFirst {     cacheName: 'app-images',     plugins: [       new workbox.expiration.Plugin {         maxEntries: 50,         maxAgeSeconds: 864000       } ,     ],   } ,  ;  This example caches a maximum of 50 .png, .jpg, and .svg files for 10 days  864,000 seconds .  The example also adds an additional cache called app-images just for those image files.   Controlling Cache Strategies  223  When you turn off the network connection in the browser developer tools and reload the app,  you’ll see that this version of the app has some of the same problems highlighted in Figure 9.3. In  this case, the issue is that our caching strategy isn’t caching several of the external resources used  by the app  some fonts and the SweetAlert2 library . There are several approaches to solving this  problem.  You can add handlers for specific resources, putting them in a separate cache, as follows:  workbox.routing.registerRoute    'https:  cdn.jsdelivr.net npm sweetalert2@8',   new workbox.strategies.CacheFirst {     cacheName: 'external-cache',     plugins: [       new workbox.cacheableResponse.Plugin {         statuses: [0, 200],       }      ]   }   ;  In this example, I use the cacheableResponse plugin to enable caching resources that won’t  normally be cached by a service worker because of cross-origin resource sharing  CORS  issues. I  explained this issue in Chapter 4, “Resource Caching.”  You can also implement a route that matches any requests for fonts from https:  fonts.googleapis. com and stores them off in a cache:  workbox.routing.registerRoute     ^https:\ \ fonts\.googleapis\.com ,   new workbox.strategies.StaleWhileRevalidate {     cacheName: 'external-cache',   } ,  ;  workbox.routing.setDefaultHandler    new workbox.strategies.NetworkFirst {     cacheName: 'default-cache'   }   ;  Probably the easiest solution in this case is to just set a default handler for any missed resources,  catching any resources that aren’t matched using any other routes. Add the following code to the  bottom of the service worker:  In this example, we added a cache called default-cache and told Workbox to put all unmatched  resources there. When you reload the app and look at cache storage, you’ll see the external  resources cached, as shown in Figure 9.7.   224  Chapter 9  Automating Service Workers with Google Workbox  Figure 9.7  The Tip Calculator’s Default Cache  Wrap-Up In this whirlwind chapter, I showed you how to use Google’s Workbox toolkit to generate service  workers for your app or build service workers using Workbox’s modular caching strategies rather  than writing and maintaining all the caching code yourself. The material provided in this chapter  merely scratches the surface of what you can do with Workbox. You should spend some time with  Google’s Workbox documentation and samples to learn more about how Workbox can make your  life easier.  This chapter wraps up the book as well. I truly hope you enjoyed this journey from manifest files  to service workers and all the capabilities they provide.
