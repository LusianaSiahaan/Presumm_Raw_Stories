[ xi ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Getting Started with OpenCV  Computer Vision applications are interesting and useful, but the underlying  algorithms are computationally intensive. With the advent of cloud computing, we  are getting more processing power to work with. The OpenCV library enables you to  run Computer Vision algorithms eficiently in real time. It has been around for many  years and it has become the standard library in this ield. One of the main advantages  of OpenCV is that it is highly optimized and available on almost all platforms. The  discussions in this book will cover everything, including the algorithm we are using,  why we are using it, and how to implement it in OpenCV.  In this chapter, we are going to learn how to install OpenCV on various operating  systems. We will discuss what OpenCV offers out of the box and the various things  that we can do using the in-built functions.  By the end of this chapter, you will be able to answer the following questions:     How do humans process visual data and how do they understand    image content?     What can we do with OpenCV and what are the various modules available    in OpenCV that can be used to achieve those things?     How to install OpenCV on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X?  Understanding the human visual system Before we jump into OpenCV functionalities, we need to understand why those  functions were built in the irst place. It's important to understand how the human  visual system works so that you can develop the right algorithms. The goal of the  Computer Vision algorithms is to understand the content of images and videos.  Humans seem to do it effortlessly! So, how do we get machines to do it with the  same accuracy?  [ 1 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Getting Started with OpenCV  Let's consider the following igure:  The human eye captures all the information that comes along such as color, shapes,  brightness, and so on. In the preceding image, the human eye captures all the  information about the two main objects and stores it in a certain way. Once we  understand how our system works, we can take advantage of this to achieve what  we want. For example, here are a few things we need to know:     Our visual system is more sensitive to low frequency content than high   frequency content. Low frequency content refers to planar regions where pixel  values don't change rapidly and high frequency content refers to regions with  corners and edges, where pixel values fluctuate a lot. You will have noticed  that we can easily see if there are blotches on a planar surface, but it's difficult  to spot something like that on a highly textured surface.     The human eye is more sensitive to changes in brightness as compared to   changes in color.     Our visual system is sensitive to motion. We can quickly recognize if   something is moving in our field of vision even though we are not directly  looking at it.  [ 2 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 1     We tend to make a mental note of salient points in our field of vision. Let's   consider a white table with four black legs and a red dot at one of the corners  of the table surface. When you look at this table, you'll immediately make  a mental note that the surface and legs have opposing colors and there is a  red dot on one of the corners. Our brain is really smart that way! We do this  automatically so that we can immediately recognize it if we encounter   it again.  To get an idea of our ield of view, let's take a look at the top view of a human and  the angles at which we see various things:  Our visual system is actually capable of a lot more things, but this should be good  enough to get us started. You can explore further by reading up on Human Visual  System Models on the internet.  How do humans understand image  content? If you look around, you will see a lot of objects. You may encounter many different  objects every day, and you recognize them almost instantaneously without any  effort. When you see a chair, you don't wait for a few minutes before realizing that it  is, in fact, a chair. You just know that it's a chair right away! Now, on the other hand,  computers ind it very dificult to do this task. Researchers have been working for  many years to ind out why computers are not as good as we are at this.  [ 3 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Getting Started with OpenCV  To get an answer to this question, we need to understand how humans do it. The  visual data processing happens in the ventral visual stream. This ventral visual  stream refers to the pathway in our visual system that is associated with object  recognition. It is basically a hierarchy of areas in our brain that helps us recognize  objects. Humans can recognize different objects effortlessly, and we can cluster  similar objects together. We can do this because we have developed some sort of  invariance toward objects of the same class. When we look at an object, our brain  extracts the salient points in such a way that factors such as orientation, size,  perspective, and illumination don't matter.  A chair that is double the normal size and rotated by 45 degrees is still a chair. We  can easily recognize it because of the way we process it. Machines cannot do this  so easily. Humans tend to remember an object based on its shape and important  features. Regardless of how the object is placed, we can still recognize it. In our  visual system, we build these hierarchical invariances with respect to position,   scale, and viewpoint that help us to be very robust.  If you look deeper in our system, you will see that humans have cells in their visual  cortex that can respond to shapes, such as curves and lines. As we move further  along our ventral stream, we will see more complex cells that are trained to respond  to more complex objects, such as trees, gates, and so on. The neurons along our  ventral stream tend to show an increase in the size of the receptive ield. This is  coupled with the fact that the complexity of their preferred stimuli increases as well.  Why is it dificult for machines to understand  image content? We now understand how visual data enters the human visual system and how our  system processes it. The issue is that we still don't completely understand how our  brain recognizes and organizes this visual data. We just extract some features from  images and ask the computer to learn from them using machine learning algorithms.  We still have those variations such as shape, size, perspective, angle, illumination,  occlusion, and so on. For example, the same chair looks very different to a machine  when you look at it from the side view. Humans can easily recognize that it's a chair  regardless of how it's presented to us. So, how do we explain this to our machines?  [ 4 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 1  One way to do this would be to store all the different variations of an object,  including sizes, angles, perspectives, and so on. But this process is cumbersome and  time-consuming! Also, it's actually not possible to gather data that can encompass  every single variation. The machines will consume a huge amount of memory and  a lot of time to build a model that can recognize these objects. Even with all this, if  an object is partially occluded, computers still won't be able to recognize it. This is  because they think that this is a new object. So, when we build a Computer Vision  library, we need to build the underlying functional blocks that can be combined  in many different ways to formulate complex algorithms. OpenCV provides a lot  of these functions and they are highly optimized. So, once we understand what  OpenCV provides out of the box, we can use it effectively to build interesting  applications. Let's go ahead and explore this in the next section.  What can you do with OpenCV? Using OpenCV, you can pretty much do every Computer Vision task that you can  think of. Real-life problems require you to use many blocks together to achieve the  desired result. So, you just need to understand what modules and functions to use to  get what you want. Let's understand what OpenCV can do out of the box.  In-built data structures and input output One of the best things about OpenCV is that it provides a lot of in-built primitives  to handle operations related to image processing and Computer Vision. If you have  to write something from scratch, you will have to deine things, such as an image,  point, rectangle, and so on. These are fundamental to almost any Computer Vision  algorithm. OpenCV comes with all these basic structures out of the box, and they  are contained in the core module. Another advantage is that these structures have  already been optimized for speed and memory, so you don't have to worry about the  implementation details.  The imgcodecs module handles reading and writing image iles. When you operate  on an input image and create an output image, you can save it as a jPg or a Png  ile with a simple command. You will be dealing with a lot of video iles when you  are working with cameras. The videoio module handles everything related to the  input output of video iles. You can easily capture a video from a webcam or read a  video ile in many different formats. You can even save a bunch of frames as a video  ile by setting properties such as frames per second, frame size, and so on.  [ 5 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Getting Started with OpenCV  Image processing operations When you write a Computer Vision algorithm, there are a lot of basic image  processing operations that you will use over and over again. Most of these functions  are present in the imgproc module. You can do things such as image iltering,  morphological operations, geometric transformations, color conversions, drawing  on images, histograms, shape analysis, motion analysis, feature detection, and so on.  Let's consider the following igure:  The right-hand side image is a rotated version of the left-hand side image.   We can do this transformation with a single line in OpenCV. There is another  module called ximgproc that contains advanced image processing algorithms   such as structured forests for edge detection, domain transform ilters, adaptive  manifold ilters, and so on.  Building GUI  OpenCV provides a module called highgui that handles all the high-level   user interface operations. Let's say that you are working on a problem and you want  to check what the image looks like before you proceed to the next step. This module  has functions that can be used to create windows to display images and or video.  There is also a waiting function that will wait until you hit a key on your keyboard  before it goes to the next step. There is a function that can detect mouse events as  well. This is very useful to develop interactive applications. Using this functionality,  you can draw rectangles on these input windows and then proceed based on the  selected region.   [ 6 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Consider the following image:  Chapter 1  As you can see, we have drawn a green rectangle on the image and applied a negative  ilm effect to that region. Once we have the coordinates of this rectangle, we can  operate only on that region.  Video analysis Video analysis includes tasks such as analyzing the motion between successive frames  in a video, tracking different objects in a video, creating models for video surveillance,  and so on. OpenCV provides a module called video that can handle all of this. There is  a module called videostab that deals with video stabilization. Video stabilization is an  important part of video cameras. When you capture videos by holding the camera in  your hands, it's hard to keep your hands perfectly steady. If you look at that video as it  is, it will look bad and jittery. All modern devices use video stabilization techniques to  process the videos before they are presented to the end user.  [ 7 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Getting Started with OpenCV  3D reconstruction 3D reconstruction is an important topic in Computer Vision. Given a set of 2D  images, we can reconstruct the 3D scene using the relevant algorithms. OpenCV  provides algorithms that can ind the relationship between various objects in these  2D images to compute their 3D positions. We have a module called calib3d that can  handle all this. This module can also handle camera calibration, which is essential to  estimate the parameters of the camera. These parameters are basically the internal  parameters of any given camera that uses them to transform the captured scene into  an image. We need to know these parameters to design algorithms, or else we might  get unexpected results. Let's consider the following igure:  As shown in the preceding image, the same object is captured from multiple poses.  Our job is to reconstruct the original object using these 2D images.  [ 8 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 1  Feature extraction As discussed earlier, the human visual system tends to extract the salient features  from a given scene so that it can be retrieved later. To mimic this, people started  designing various feature extractors that can extract these salient points from  a given image. Some of the popular algorithms include SIFT  Scale Invariant  Feature Transform , SURF  Speeded Up Robust Features , FAST  Features from  Accelerated Segment Test , and so on. There is a module called features2d that  provides functions to detect and extract all these features. There is another module  called xfeatures2d that provides a few more feature extractors, some of which are  still in the experimental phase. You can play around with these if you get a chance.  There is also a module called bioinspired that provides algorithms for biologically  inspired Computer Vision models.  Object detection Object detection refers to detecting the location of an object in a given image. This  process is not concerned with the type of object. If you design a chair detector, it will  just tell you the location of the chair in a given image. It will not tell you whether it's  a red chair with a high back or a blue chair with a low back. Detecting the location  of objects is a very critical step in many Computer Vision systems. Consider the  following image:  [ 9 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Getting Started with OpenCV  If you run a chair detector on this image, it will put a green box around all the  chairs. It won't tell you what kind of chair it is! Object detection used to be a  computationally intensive task because of the number of calculations required to  perform the detection at various scales. To solve this, Paul Viola and Michael Jones  came up with a great algorithm in their seminal paper in 2001. You can read it at  https:  www.cs.cmu.edu ~efros courses LBMV07 Papers viola-cvpr-01.pdf.  They provided a fast way to design an object detector for any object. OpenCV has  modules called objdetect and xobjdetect that provide the framework to design  an object detector. You can use it to develop detectors for random items such as  sunglasses, boots, and so on.  Machine learning Computer Vision uses various machine learning algorithms to achieve different  things. OpenCV provides a module called ml that has many machine learning  algorithms bundled into it. Some of the algorithms include Bayes Classiier,  K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Neural   Networks, and so on. It also has a module called flann that contains algorithms   for fast-nearest-neighbor searches in large datasets. Machine learning algorithms   are used extensively to build systems for object recognition, image classiication,   face detection, visual searches, and so on.  Computational photography Computational photography refers to using advanced image processing techniques  to improve the images captured by cameras. Instead of focusing on optical  processes and image capture methods, computational photography uses software  to manipulate visual data. Some applications include high dynamic range imaging,  panoramic images, image relighting, light ield cameras, and so on.   Downloading the example code You can download the example code iles for all Packt books you have  purchased from your account at http:  www.packtpub.com. If you  purchased this book elsewhere, you can visit http:  www.packtpub. com support and register to have the iles e-mailed directly to you.  Instructions for running example are available in the README.md ile  present in the root folder of each project.  [ 10 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Let's take a look at the following image:  Chapter 1  Look at those vivid colors! This is an example of a high dynamic range image and  it wouldn't be possible to get this using conventional image capture techniques.  To do this, we have to capture the same scene at multiple exposures, register those  images with each other, and then blend them nicely to create this image. The photo  and xphoto modules contain various algorithms that provide algorithms pertaining  to computational photography. There is a module called stitching that provides  algorithms to create panoramic images.  The preceding image can be found at https:  pixabay.com en  hdr-high-dynamic-range-landscape-806260 .  [ 11 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Getting Started with OpenCV  Shape analysis The notion of shape is crucial in Computer Vision. We analyze the visual data by  recognizing various different shapes in the image. This is actually an important step  in many algorithms. Let's say you are trying to identify a particular logo in an image.  Now, you know that it can appear in various shapes, orientations, sizes, and so on.  One good way to get started is to quantify the characteristics of the shape of the  object. The module shape provides all the algorithms required to extract different  shapes, measure similarities between them, transform shapes of objects, and so on.  Optical low algorithms Optical low algorithms are used in videos to track features across successive frames.  Let's say you want to track a particular object in a video. Running a feature extractor  on each frame would be computationally expensive; hence, the process would  be slow. So, you just need to extract the features from the current frame and then  track these features in successive frames. Optical low algorithms are heavily used  in video-based applications in Computer Vision. The optflow module contains a  number of algorithms required to perform optical low. There is also a module   called tracking that contains more algorithms that can be used to track features.  Face and object recognition Face recognition refers to identifying the person in a given image. This is not the  same as face detection where you identify the location of a face in the given image.  So, if you want to build a practical biometric system that can recognize the person  in front of the camera, you irst need to run the face detector that can identify the  location of the face, and then, run a face recognizer that can recognize who that  person is. There is a module called face that deals with face recognition.  As discussed earlier, Computer Vision tries to model algorithms based on how  humans perceive the visual data. So, it would be helpful to ind salient regions and  objects in the images that can help different applications, such as object recognition,  object detection and tracking, and so on. There is a module called saliency that's  designed for this purpose. It provides algorithms that can detect salient regions in  static images and videos.  [ 12 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 1  Surface matching We are increasingly interacting with devices that can capture the 3D structure of  the objects around us. These devices basically capture the depth information along  with the regular 2D color images. So, it's important for us to build algorithms that  can understand and process 3D objects. Kinect is a good example of a device that  captures the depth information along with the visual data. The task at hand is to  recognize the input 3D object by matching it with one of the models in our database.  If we have a system that can recognize and locate objects, then it can be used for  many different applications. There is a module called surface_matching that  contains algorithms for 3D object recognition and a pose estimation algorithm   using 3D features.  Text detection and recognition Identifying text in a given scene and recognizing the content is becoming  increasingly important. Some applications include nameplate recognition,  recognizing road signs for self-driving cars, book scanning to digitize the contents,  and so on. There is a module called text that contains various algorithms to handle  text detection and recognition.  Installing OpenCV Let's see how to get OpenCV up-and-running on various operating systems.  Windows To keep things easy, let's install OpenCV using prebuilt libraries. Let's go to   http:  opencv.org and download the latest version for Windows. The current  version is 3.0.0, and you can go to the OpenCV homepage to get the latest link to  download the package.  You need to make sure you have admin rights before you proceed. The downloaded  ile will be an executable ile, so just double-click on it to start the installation process.  The installer expands the content into a folder. You will be able to choose the  installation path and check the installation by inspecting the iles.  [ 13 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Getting Started with OpenCV  Once you are done with the previous step, we need to set the OpenCV environment  variables and add it to the system path to complete the installation. We will set up an  environment variable that will hold the build directory of the OpenCV library. We will  be using this in our projects. Open the terminal and type the following command:  C:\> setx -m OPENCV_DIR D:\OpenCV\Build\x64\vc11  We are assuming that you have a 64-bit machine with Visual Studio  2012 installed. If you have Visual Studio 2010, replace vc11 with  vc10 in the preceding command. The path speciied earlier is where  we will have our OpenCV binaries, and you will see two folders  inside this path called lib and bin. If you are using Visual Studio  2015, you should be able to compile OpenCV from scratch.  Let's go ahead and add the path to the bin folder of our system's path. The reason  we need to do this is because we will be using the OpenCV library in the form of  Dynamic Link Libraries  DLLs . Basically, all the OpenCV algorithms are stored  here, and our operating system will only load them during runtime. In order to do  this, our operating system needs to know where they are located. The system's PATH  variable will contain a list of all the folders where it can ind the DLLs. So, naturally,  we need to add the path to the OpenCV library to this list. Now, why do we need  to do all this? Well, the other option is to copy the required DLLs to the same folder  as the application's executable ile  the .exe ile . This is an unnecessary overhead,  especially when we are working with many different projects.  We need to edit the PATH variable in order to add it to this folder. You can   use software such as Path Editor to do this. You can download it from   https:  patheditor2.codeplex.com. Once you install it, start it and add the  following new entry  you can right-click on the path to insert a new item :  %OPENCV_DIR%\bin  Go ahead and save it to the registry. We are done!  Mac OS X In this section, we will see how to install OpenCV on Mac OS X. Precompiled  binaries are not available for Mac OS X, so we need to compile OpenCV from   scratch. Before we proceed, we need to install CMake. If you don't have CMake  already installed, you can download it from https:  cmake.org files v3.3  cmake-3.3.2-Darwin-x86_64.dmg. It's a DMg ile! So, once you download it,   just run the installer.  [ 14 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 1  Download the latest version of OpenCV from opencv.org. The current version  is 3.0.0, and you can download it from https:  github.com Itseez opencv  archive 3.0.0.zip.  Unzip the contents into a folder of your choice. OpenCV 3.0.0 also has a new package  called opencv_contrib that contains user contributions that are not yet considered  stable. One thing to keep in mind is that some of the algorithms in the opencv_ contrib package are not freely available for commercial use. Also, installing this  package is optional. OpenCV will work just ine if you don't install opencv_contrib.  Since we are installing OpenCV anyway, it's good to install this package so that you  can experiment with it later on  as opposed to going through the whole installation  process again . This package is a great way to learn and play around with new  algorithms. You can download it from https:  github.com Itseez opencv_ contrib archive 3.0.0.zip.  Unzip the contents of the ZIP ile into a folder of your choice. For convenience, unzip  it into the same folder, as mentioned earlier, so that the opencv-3.0.0 and opencv_ contrib-3.0.0 folders are in the same main folder.  We are now ready to build OpenCV. Open your terminal and navigate to the folder  where you unzipped the contents of OpenCV 3.0.0. Run the following commands  after substituting the right paths in the commands:  $ cd  full path to opencv-3.0.0   $ mkdir build  $ cd build  $ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX= full path  to opencv-3.0.0 build -D INSTALL_C_EXAMPLES=ON -D BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -D  OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH= full path to opencv_contrib-3.0.0 modules ..   It's time to install OpenCV 3.0.0. Go inside the  full path to opencv-3.0.0  build directory and run the following commands on your terminal:  $ make -j4  $ make install  In the preceding command, the -j4 lag indicates that it is using four cores to install  it. It's faster this way! Now, let's set the library path. Open your ~ .profile ile in  your terminal using the vi ~ .profile command, and add the following line:  export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH= full path to opencv-3.0.0 build lib:$DYLD_ LIBRARY_PATH  [ 15 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Getting Started with OpenCV  We need to copy the pkg-config ile opencv.pc to  usr local lib pkgconfig  and name it opencv3.pc. This way, if you already have an existing OpenCV 2.4.x  installation, there will be no conlicts. Let's go ahead and do this:  $ cp  full path to opencv-3.0.0 build lib pkgconfig opencv.pc  usr local  lib pkgconfig opencv3.pc  We need to update our PKg_COnFIg_PATH variable as well. Open your ~ .profile  ile, and add the following line:  export PKg_COnFIg_PATH= usr local lib pkgconfig :$PKg_COnFIg_PATH  Reload your ~ .profile ile using the following command:  $ source ~ .profile  We are done! Let's see if it's working:  $ cd  full path to opencv-3.0.0 samples cpp  $ g++ -ggdb 'pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv3' opencv_version.cpp -o   tmp opencv_version &&  tmp opencv_version  If you see Welcome to OpenCV 3.0.0 printed on your terminal, you are good to   go. We will be using CMake to build our OpenCV projects throughout this book.   We will cover this in more detail in the next chapter.  Linux Let's see how to install OpenCV on Ubuntu. We need to install some dependencies  before we begin. Let's install them using the package manager by running the  following command on your terminal:  $ sudo apt-get -y install libopencv-dev build-essential cmake  libdc1394-22 libdc1394-22-dev libjpeg-dev libpng12-dev libtiff4-dev  libjasper-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libxine-dev  libgstreamer0.10-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev libv4l-dev libtbb- dev libqt4-dev libmp3lame-dev libopencore-amrnb-dev libopencore-amrwb-dev  libtheora-dev libvorbis-dev libxvidcore-dev x264 v4l-utils  Now that you have installed the dependencies, let's download, build, and install  OpenCV:  $ wget "https:  github.com Itseez opencv archive 3.0.0.zip" -O opencv.zip  $ wget "https:  github.com Itseez opencv_contrib archive 3.0.0.zip" -O  opencv_contrib.zip  $ unzip opencv.zip –d .  [ 16 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 1  $ unzip opencv_contrib.zip –d .  $ cd opencv-3.0.0  $ mkdir build  $ cd build  $ make –j4  $ sudo make install  $ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX= full path  to opencv-3.0.0 build -D INSTALL_C_EXAMPLES=ON -D BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -D  OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH= full path to opencv_contrib-3.0.0 modules ..   Let's copy the pkg-config ile's opencv.pc to  usr local lib pkgconfig and  name it opencv3.pc:  $ cp  full path to opencv-3.0.0 build lib pkgconfig opencv.pc  usr local  lib pkgconfig opencv3.pc  We are done! We will now be able to use it to compile our OpenCV programs from  the command line. Also, if you already have an existing OpenCV 2.4.x installation,  there will be no conlicts. Let's check whether the installation is working properly:  $ cd  full path to opencv-3.0.0 samples cpp  $ g++ -ggdb 'pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv3' opencv_version.cpp -o   tmp opencv_version &&  tmp opencv_version  If you see Welcome to OpenCV 3.0.0 printed on your terminal, you are good   to go. In the following chapters, you will learn how to use CMake to build your  OpenCV projects.  Summary In this chapter, we learned how to install OpenCV across various operating systems.  We discussed the human visual system and how humans process visual data. We  understood why it's dificult for machines to do the same and what we need to  consider while designing a Computer Vision library. We learned what can be done  using OpenCV and the various modules that can be used to do those tasks.  In the next chapter, we will discuss how to operate on images and how we can  manipulate them using various functions. We will also learn how to build a project  structure for our OpenCV applications.  [ 17 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   An Introduction to the Basics  of OpenCV  After covering the installation of OpenCV on different operating systems in   Chapter 1, Getting Started with OpenCV, we are going to introduce the basics of   OpenCV development in this chapter.  In this chapter, you will learn how to create your project using CMake.  We will also introduce the image basic data structures, matrices, and other structures  that are required in our projects.  We will learn how to save our variables and data in iles using the XML YAML  persistence OpenCV functions.  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:   	 Configuring projects with CMake  	 Reading writing images from to disk  	 Reading videos and accessing camera devices  	 The main image structures  matrices   	 Other important and basic structures  vectors, scalars, and so on   	 An introduction to basic matrix operations  	 File storage operations with the XML YAML persistence OpenCV API  [ 19 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   An Introduction to the Basics of OpenCV  Basic CMake coniguration iles To conigure and check all the required dependencies of our project, we are going  to use CMake; but it is not mandatory, so we can conigure our project in any other  tool or IDE such as Makeiles or Visual Studio. However, CMake is the most portable  way to conigure multiplatform C++ projects.  CMake uses coniguration iles called CMakeLists.txt, where the compilation and  dependency processes are deined. For a basic project, based on an executable build  from one source code ile, a two-line CMakeLists.txt ile is all that is needed. The  ile looks like this:  cmake_minimum_required  VERSIOn 2.6  project  CMakeTest  add_executable ${PROjECT_nAME} main.cpp   The irst line deines the minimum version of CMake required. This line is  mandatory in our CMakeLists.txt ile and allows you to use the cmake functionality  deined from a given version deined in the second line; it deines the project name.  This name is saved in a variable called PROjECT_nAME.  The last line creates an executable command  add_executable    in the main.cpp  ile, gives it the same name as our project  ${PROjECT_nAME} , and compiles our  source code into an executable called CMakeTest, which we set as the project name.  The ${} expression allows access to any variable deined in our environment.   Then, we can use the ${PROjECT_nAME} variable as an executable output name.  Creating a library CMake allows you to create libraries, which are indeed used by the OpenCV build  system. Factorizing the shared code among multiple applications is a common and  useful practice in software development. In big applications or when the common  code is shared in multiple applications, this practice is very useful.  In this case, we do not create a binary executable; instead, we create a compiled ile  that includes all the functions, classes, and so on, developed. We can then share this  library ile with the other applications without sharing our source code.  CMake includes the add_library function for this purpose:   Create our hello library add_library Hello hello.cpp hello.h   [ 20 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2   Create our application that uses our new library add_executable executable main.cpp    Link our executable with the new library target_link_libraries  executable Hello    The lines starting with  add comments and are ignored by CMake.  The add_library Hello hello.cpp hello.h  command deines our new   library called, where Hello is the library name and hello.cpp, hello.h are the  source iles. We add the header ile to allow IDEs such as Visual Studio to link to the  header iles.  This line will generate a shared ile  So for OS X and Unix or .dll for Windows   or a static library  A for OS X and Unix or .dll for Windows , depending on our  operating system or if it is a dynamic or static library.  target_link_libraries  executable Hello  is the function that links our  executable to the desired library; in our case, it's the Hello library.  Managing dependencies CMake has the ability to search our dependencies and external libraries, giving us  the facility to build complex projects depending on external components in our  projects and by adding some requirements.  In this book, the most important dependency is, of course, OpenCV, and we will add  it to all our projects:  cmake_minimum_required  VERSIOn 2.6  cmake_policy SET CMP0012 nEW  PROjECT Chapter2   Requires OpenCV FInD_PACKAgE  OpenCV 3.0.0 REQUIRED    Show a message with the opencv version detected MESSAgE "OpenCV version : ${OpenCV_VERSIOn}"  include_directories ${OpenCV_InCLUDE_DIRS}  link_directories ${OpenCV_LIB_DIR}   Create a variable called SRC SET SRC main.cpp    Create our executable ADD_EXECUTABLE  ${PROjECT_nAME} ${SRC}    Link our library TARgET_LInK_LIBRARIES  ${PROjECT_nAME} ${OpenCV_LIBS}    [ 21 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   An Introduction to the Basics of OpenCV  Now, let's understand the working of the script:  cmake_minimum_required  VERSIOn 2.6  cmake_policy SET CMP0012 nEW  PROjECT Chapter2   The irst line deines the minimum CMake version; the second line tells CMake  to use the new behavior of CMake so that it can correctly recognize numbers and  Booleans constants without dereferencing variables with such names. This policy  was introduced in CMake 2.8.0, and CMake warns when the policy is not set to  version 3.0.2. Finally, the last line deines the project title:   Requires OpenCV FInD_PACKAgE  OpenCV 3.0.0 REQUIRED    Show a message with the opencv version detected MESSAgE "OpenCV version : ${OpenCV_VERSIOn}"  include_directories ${OpenCV_InCLUDE_DIRS}  link_directories ${OpenCV_LIB_DIR}   This is where we search for our OpenCV dependency. FInD_PACKAgE is the function  that allows us to ind our dependencies and the minimum version required if this  dependency is required or optional. In this sample script, we look for OpenCV in  version 3.0.0 or greater and it is a required package.  The FInD_PACKAgE command includes all OpenCV submodules,  but you can specify the submodules that you want to include in the  project by making your application smaller and faster. For example,  if we are going to work only with the basic OpenCV types and core  functionalities, we can use the following command: FIND_PACKAGE OpenCV 3.0.0 REQUIRED core   If CMake does not ind it, it returns an error and does not prevent us from compiling  our application.  The MESSAGE function shows a message on the terminal or CMake GUI. In our  case, we will show the OpenCV version, as follows:  OpenCV version : 3.0.0  ${OpenCV_VERSIOn} is a variable where CMake stores the OpenCV package version.  [ 22 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The include_directories   and link_directories   add the header and the  directory of the speciied library to our environment. OpenCV's CMake module  saves this data in the ${OpenCV_InCLUDE_DIRS} and ${OpenCV_LIB_DIR} variables.  These lines are not required in all platforms, such as Linux, because these paths are  normally in the environment, but it's recommended that you have more than one  OpenCV version to choose from the correct link and include directories:  Chapter 2   Create a variable called SRC SET SRC main.cpp    Create our executable ADD_EXECUTABLE  ${PROjECT_nAME} ${SRC}    Link our library TARgET_LInK_LIBRARIES  ${PROjECT_nAME} ${OpenCV_LIBS}    This last line creates the executable and links it to the OpenCV library, as we saw in  the previous section, Creating a library.  There is a new function in this piece of code called SET. This function creates a new  variable and adds any value that we need to it. In our case, we set the SRC variable  to the main.cpp value. However, we can add more and more values to the same  variable, as shown in this script:  SET SRC main.cpp         utils.cpp         color.cpp    Making the script more complex In this section, we will show you a more complex script that includes subfolders,  libraries, and executables, all in only two iles and a few lines, as shown in this script.  It's not mandatory to create multiple CMakeLists.txt iles because we can   specify everything in the main CMakeLists.txt ile. It is more common to use  different CMakeLists.txt iles for each project subfolder, making it more lexible  and portable.  [ 23 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   An Introduction to the Basics of OpenCV  This example has a code structure folder that contains one folder for the utils  library and the other for the root folder, which contains the main executable:  CMakeLists.txt main.cpp utils    CMakeLists.txt   computeTime.cpp   computeTime.h   logger.cpp   logger.h   plotting.cpp   plotting.h  Then, we need to deine two CMakeLists.txt iles: one in the root folder   and the other in the utils folder. The CMakeLists.txt root folder ile has the  following contents:  cmake_minimum_required  VERSIOn 2.6  project  Chapter2    Opencv Package required FInD_PACKAgE  OpenCV  3.0.0 REQUIRED    Add opencv header files to project include_directories  ${OpenCV_InCLUDE_DIR}   link_directories ${OpenCV_LIB_DIR}   add_subdirectory utils     Add optional log with a precompiler definition option WITH_LOg "Build with output logs and images in tmp" OFF  if WITH_LOg    add_definitions -DLOg  endif WITH_LOg    generate our new executable add_executable  ${PROjECT_nAME} main.cpp    link the project with his dependencies target_link_libraries  ${PROjECT_nAME} ${OpenCV_LIBS} Utils   Almost all the lines are described in the previous sections except for some functions  that we will explain in later sections.  [ 24 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2  The add_subdirectory   tells CMake to analyze the CMakeLists.txt of a   desired subfolder.  Before we continue with an explanation of the main CMakeLists.txt ile, we will  explain the utils CMakeLists.txt ile.  In the CMakeLists.txt ile in the utils folder, we will write a new library to  include it in our main project folder:   Add new variable for src utils lib SET UTILS_LIB_SRC   computeTime.cpp    logger.cpp    plotting.cpp    create our new utils lib add_library Utils ${UTILS_LIB_SRC}    make sure the compiler can find include files for our library target_include_directories Utils PUBLIC ${CMAKE_CURREnT_SOURCE_DIR}   This CMake script ile deines an UTILS_LIB_SRC variable where we add all the  source iles included in our library, generate the library with the add_library  function, and use the target_include_directories function to allow our main  project to detect all header iles.  Leaving out the utils subfolder and continuing with the root cmake script, the  Option function creates a new variable—in our case, WITH_LOg, with a small  description attached. This variable can be changed via the ccmake command line or  CMake GUI interface, where the description and a checkbox appears that allow users  to enable or disable this option.  This function is very useful and allows the user to decide about compile-time  features such as enabling or disabling logs, compiling with Java or Python support   as with OpenCV, and so on.  In our case, we use this option to enable a logger in our application. To enable the  logger, we use a precompiler deinition in our code:  ifdef LOg logi "number of iteration %d", i ; endif  [ 25 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   An Introduction to the Basics of OpenCV  To tell our compiler that we require the LOg compile time deinition, we use the   add_definitions -DLOg  function in our CMakeLists.txt. To allow the user to  decide whether they want to enable it or not, we only have to verify whether the  WITH_LOg CMake variable is checked or not with a simple condition:  if WITH_LOg    add_definitions -DLOg  endif WITH_LOg   Now, we are ready to create our CMake script iles to be compiled in any operating  system our Computer Vision projects. Then, we will continue with the OpenCV  basics before we start with a sample project.  Images and matrices The most important structure in a Computer Vision is without any doubt the images.  The image in Computer Vision is a representation of the physical world captured  with a digital device. This picture is only a sequence of numbers stored in a matrix  format, as shown in the following image. Each number is a measurement of the light  intensity for the considered wavelength  for example, red, green, or blue in color  images  or for a wavelength range  for panchromatic devices . Each point in an  image is called a pixel  for a picture element , and each pixel can store one or more  values depending on whether it is a gray, black, or white image  called a binary  image as well  that stores only one value, such as 0 or 1, a gray-scale-level image that  can store only one value, or a color image that can store three values. These values  are usually integer numbers between 0 and 255, but you can use the other range. For  example, 0 to 1 in a loating point numbers such as HDRI  High Dynamic Range  Imaging  or thermal images.  [ 26 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The image is stored in a matrix format, where each pixel has a position in it and can  be referenced by the number of the column and row. OpenCV uses the Mat class for  this purpose. In the case of a grayscale image, a single matrix is used, as shown in the  following igure:  Chapter 2  [ 27 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   An Introduction to the Basics of OpenCV  In the case of a color image, as shown in the following image, we use a matrix of size  width x height x number of colors:  The Mat class is not only used to store images, but also to store different types of  arbitrarily sized matrices. You can use is it as an algebraic matrix and perform  operations with it. In the next section, we are going to describe the most important  matrix operations such as add, matrix multiplication, create a diagonal matrix,   and so on.  However, before that, it's important to know how the matrix is stored internally  in the computer memory because it is always better to have eficient access to the  memory slots instead of access to each pixel with the OpenCV functions.  [ 28 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   In memory, the matrix is saved as an array or sequence of values ordered by columns  and rows. The following table shows the sequence of pixels in the BGR image format:  Chapter 2  Row 0  Row 1  Row 2  Col 0  Col 0  Col 1  Col 2  Col 0  Col 1  Col 2  Col 1  Col 2  Pixel 1  Pixel 2  Pixel 3  Pixel 4  Pixel 5  Pixel 6  Pixel 7  Pixel 8  Pixel 9  B G R B G R B G R B G R B G R  B  G R  B  G R  B  G R  B  G R  With this order, we can access any pixel, as shown in the following formula:  Value= Row_i*num_cols*num_channels + Col_i + channel_i  OpenCV functions are quite optimized for random access, but sometimes  direct access to the memory  working with pointer arithmetic  is more  eficient—for example, when we have access to all the pixels in a loop.  Reading writing images After the introduction of this matrix, we are going to start with the basics of the  OpenCV code. Firstly, we need to learn how to read and write images:  include   include   include   using namespace std;     OpenCV includes include "opencv2 core.hpp" include "opencv2 highgui.hpp" using namespace cv;  int main  int argc, const char** argv   {      Read images   Mat color= imread ".. lena.jpg" ;   Mat gray= imread ".. lena.jpg", 0 ;         Write images   imwrite "lenagray.jpg", gray ;     [ 29 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   An Introduction to the Basics of OpenCV       get same pixel with opencv function   int myRow=color.cols-1;   int myCol=color.rows-1;   Vec3b pixel= color.at  myRow, myCol ;   cout << "Pixel value  B,g,R :  " <<  int pixel[0] << "," <<        int pixel[1] << "," <<  int pixel[2] << " " << endl;         show images   imshow "Lena BgR", color ;   imshow "Lena gray", gray ;      wait for any key press   waitKey 0 ;   return 0; }  Let's try to understand this code:     OpenCV includes include "opencv2 core.hpp" include "opencv2 highgui.hpp" using namespace cv;  First, we have to include the declarations of the functions that we need in   our sample. These functions come from core  basic image data handling  and   high-gui  the cross-platform I O functions provided by OpenCV are core and  highui. The irst includes the basic classes, such as matrices, and the second   includes the functions to read, write, and show images with graphical interfaces .     Read images Mat color= imread ".. lena.jpg" ; Mat gray= imread ".. lena.jpg", 0 ;  The imread is the main function used to read images. This function opens an  image and stores the image in a matrix format. The imread function accepts two  parameters: the irst parameter is a string that contains the image's path, and the  second parameter is optional and, by default, loads the image as a color image.   The second parameter allows the following options:   	 CV_LOAD_IMAgE_AnYDEPTH: If set to this constant, returns a 16-bit 32- bit image when the input has the corresponding depth; otherwise, the  imread function converts it to an 8-bit image   	 CV_LOAD_IMAgE_COLOR: If set to this constant, always converts the     	 CV_LOAD_IMAgE_gRAYSCALE: If set to this constant, always converts the   image to color  image to grayscale  [ 30 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2  To save images, we can use the imwrite function, which stores a matrix image in   our computer:     Write images imwrite "lenagray.jpg", gray ;  The irst parameter is the path where we want to save the image with the extension  format that we desire. The second parameter is the matrix image that we want to  save. In our code sample, we create and store a gray version of the image and then  save it as a JPG ile the gray image that we loaded and store in gray variable:     get same pixel with opencv function int myRow=color.cols-1; int myCol=color.rows-1;  Using the .cols and .rows attributes of a matrix, we can access the number of  columns and rows of an image—or in other words, the width and height:  Vec3b pixel= color.at  myRow, myCol ; cout << "Pixel value  B,g,R :  " <<  int pixel[0] << "," <<  int  pixel[1] << "," <<  int pixel[2] << " " << endl;  To access one pixel of an image, we use the cv::Mat::at  row,col   template function from the Mat OpenCV class. The template parameter is the desired  return type. A typename in an 8-bit color image is a Vec3b class that stores three  unsigned char data  Vec=vector, 3=number of components, and b = 1 byte . In the case  of the gray image, we can directly use the unsigned char or any other number format  used in the image, such as uchar pixel= color.at  myRow, myCol :     show images imshow "Lena BgR", color ; imshow "Lena gray", gray ;    wait for any key press waitKey 0 ;  Finally, to show the images, we can use the imshow function that creates a window  with a title as the irst parameter and the image matrix as the second parameter.  If we want to stop our application by waiting for the user to press a  key, we can use the OpenCV waitKey function with a parameter set  to the number of milliseconds we want to wait. If we set the parameter  to 0, then the function will wait forever.  [ 31 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   An Introduction to the Basics of OpenCV  The result of this code is shown in the following picture; the left-hand image is a  color image and right-hand image is a gray scale:  Finally, as an example for the following samples, we are going to create the  CMakeLists.txt to allow you to compile our project and also see how to compile it.  The following code describes the CMakeLists.txt ile:  cmake_minimum_required  VERSIOn 2.6  cmake_policy SET CMP0012 nEW  PROjECT project    Requires OpenCV FInD_PACKAgE  OpenCV 3.0.0 REQUIRED   MESSAgE "OpenCV version : ${OpenCV_VERSIOn}"   include_directories ${OpenCV_InCLUDE_DIRS}  link_directories ${OpenCV_LIB_DIR}  ADD_EXECUTABLE  sample main.cpp   TARgET_LInK_LIBRARIES  sample ${OpenCV_LIBS}    [ 32 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2  To compile our code, using the CMakeLists.txt ile we have to perform the  following steps:  1.  Create a build folder.  2.   Inside the build folder, execute cmake or open the CMake gui app in  Windows, choose the source folder and build folder, and click on the  Conigure and Generate buttons.  3.  After step 2, if we are in Linux or OS, generate a makefile; then we have   to compile the project using the make command. If we are in Windows,  we have to open the project with the editor that we selected in step 2 and  compile it.  4.  After step 3, we have an executable called app.  Reading videos and cameras This section introduces you to reading a video and camera with this simple example:  include   include   include   using namespace std;     OpenCV includes include "opencv2 core.hpp" include "opencv2 highgui.hpp" using namespace cv;     OpenCV command line parser functions    Keys accecpted by command line parser const char* keys = {     "{help h usage ?   print this message}"     "{@video   Video file, if not defined try to use webcamera}" };  int main  int argc, const char** argv   {     CommandLineParser parser argc, argv, keys ;     parser.about "Chapter 2. v1.0.0" ;  [ 33 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   An Introduction to the Basics of OpenCV        If requires help show     if  parser.has "help"       {       parser.printMessage  ;       return 0;     }     String videoFile= parser.get  0 ;             Check if params are correctly parsed in his variables     if  !parser.check        {         parser.printErrors  ;         return 0;     }      VideoCapture cap;    open the default camera     if videoFile != ""          cap.open videoFile ;     else         cap.open 0 ;     if !cap.isOpened        check if we succeeded         return -1;      namedWindow "Video",1 ;     for ;;      {         Mat frame;         cap >> frame;    get a new frame from camera         imshow "Video", frame ;         if waitKey 30  >= 0  break;     }        Release the camera or video cap     cap.release  ;          return 0; }  [ 34 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2  Before we explain how to read video or camera inputs, we need to introduce   a useful new class that will help us manage the input command line parameters;   this new class was introduced in OpenCV version 3.0 and is called the  CommandLineParser class:     OpenCV command line parser functions    Keys accepted by command line parser const char* keys = {     "{help h usage ?   print this message}"     "{@video   Video file, if not defined try to use webcamera}" };  The irst thing that we have to do for a command-line parser is deine the parameters  that we need or allow in a constant char vector; each line has this pattern:  { name_param  default_value  description}  The name_param can be preceded with @, which deines this parameter as a default  input. We can use more than one name_param:  CommandLineParser parser argc, argv, keys ;  The constructor will get the inputs of the main function and the key constants  deined previously:    If requires help show if  parser.has "help"   {         parser.printMessage  ;         return 0; }  The .has class method checks the parameter's existence. In this sample, we  check whether the user has added the –help or ? parameter, and then, use the  printMessage class function to show all the description parameters:      String videoFile= parser.get  0 ;  [ 35 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   An Introduction to the Basics of OpenCV  With the .get  parametername  function, we can access and read any of  the input parameters:         Check if params are correctly parsed in his variables     if  !parser.check        {         parser.printErrors  ;         return 0;     }  After getting all the required parameters, we can check whether these parameters are  parsed correctly and show an error message if one of the parameters is not parsed.  For example, add a string instead of a number:  VideoCapture cap;    open the default camera if videoFile != ""      cap.open videoFile ;     else     cap.open 0 ;     if !cap.isOpened        check if we succeeded     return -1;  The class to read a video and camera is the same. The VideoCapture class belongs to  the videoio submodel instead of the highgui submodule, as in the former version  of OpenCV. After creating the object, we check whether the input command line  videoFile parameter has a path ilename. If it's empty, then we try to open a web  camera and, if it has a ilename, then we open the video ile. To do this, we use the  open function, giving the video ilename or the index camera that we want to open  as a parameter. If we have a single camera, we can use 0 as a parameter.  To check whether we can read the video ilename or the camera, we use the  isOpened function:  namedWindow "Video",1 ; for ;;  {     Mat frame;     cap >> frame;    get a new frame from camera      if frame         imshow "Video", frame ;     if waitKey 30  >= 0  break; }    Release the camera or video cap cap.release  ;  [ 36 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Finally, we create a window to show the frames with the namedWindow function  and, with a non-inish loop, we grab each frame with the >> operation and show  the image with the imshow function, if we correctly retrieve the frame. In this case,  we don't want to stop the application, but we want to wait for 30 milliseconds to  check whether users want to stop the application execution with any key using  waitKey 30 .  Chapter 2  To choose a good value to wait for the next frame, using a camera  access is calculated from the speed of the camera. For example, if a  camera works at 20 FPS, a great wait value is 40 = 1000 20.  When the user wants to inish the app, he has to only press a key, and then we have  to release all the video resources using the release function.  It is very important to release all the resources that we use in a  Computer Vision application; if we do not do it, we can consume  all the RAM memory. We can release the matrices with the  release function.  The result of the code is a new window that shows a video or web camera in the BGR  format, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 37 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   An Introduction to the Basics of OpenCV  Other basic object types We have learned about the Mat and Vec3b classes, but we need to learn about other  classes as well.  In this section, we will learn about the most basic object types required in most   of the projects:  The vec object type vec is a template class that is used mainly for numerical vectors. We can deine any  type of vectors and a number of components:  Vec  myVector;  Or we can use any of the predeined types:   	 Vec  	 Scalar  	 Point  	 Size  	 Rect  	 RotatedRect  typedef Vec  Vec2b; typedef Vec  Vec3b; typedef Vec  Vec4b;  typedef Vec  Vec2s; typedef Vec  Vec3s; typedef Vec  Vec4s;  typedef Vec  Vec2i; typedef Vec  Vec3i; typedef Vec  Vec4i;  typedef Vec  Vec2f; typedef Vec  Vec3f; typedef Vec  Vec4f; typedef Vec  Vec6f;  [ 38 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   typedef Vec  Vec2d; typedef Vec  Vec3d; typedef Vec  Vec4d; typedef Vec  Vec6d;  Chapter 2  All the expected vector operations are also implemented, as follows: v1 = v2 + v3 v1 = v2 - v3 v1 = v2 * scale v1 = scale * v2 v1 = -v2 v1 += v2 and other augmenting operations v1 == v2, v1 != v2 norm v1   euclidean norm   The Scalar object type The Scalar object type is a template class derived from Vec with four elements.   The Scalar type is widely used in OpenCV to pass and read pixel values.  To access the values of Vec and Scalar, we use the [] operator.  The Point object type Another very common class template is Point. This class deines a 2D point speciied  by its x and y coordinates.  Like the Point object type, there is a Point3 template class for  3D point support.  Like the Vec class, OpenCV deines the following Point aliases for our convenience:  typedef Point_  Point2i; typedef Point2i Point; typedef Point_  Point2f; typedef Point_  Point2d;  [ 39 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   An Introduction to the Basics of OpenCV  The following operators are deined for points:  pt1 = pt2 + pt3;  pt1 = pt2 - pt3;  pt1 = pt2 * a;  pt1 = a * pt2;  pt1 = pt2   a;  pt1 += pt2;  pt1 -= pt2;  pt1 *= a;  pt1  = a;  pt1 == pt2;  pt1 != pt2;  double value = norm pt ;    L2 norm  The Size object type Another template class that is very important and used in OpenCV is the template  class used to specify the size of an image or rectangle, Size. This class adds two  members: the width and height and a useful area  function.  The Rect object type Rect is another important template class used to deine 2D rectangles by the  following parameters:   	 The coordinates of the top-left corner  	 The width and height of a rectangle  The Rect template class can be used to deine a ROI  region of interest  of an image.  RotatedRect object type The last useful class is a particular rectangle called RotatedRect. This class  represents a rotated rectangle speciied by a center point, the width and height   of a rectangle, and the rotation angle in degrees:  RotatedRect const Point2f& center, const Size2f& size, float angle ;  [ 40 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   An interesting function of this class is boundingBox; this function returns a Rect that  contains the rotated rectangle:  Chapter 2  Basic matrix operations  In this section, we will learn some basic and important matrix operations that we can  apply to images or any matrix data.  We learned how to load an image and store it in a Mat variable, but we can manually  create a Mat variable. The most common constructor that provides the matrix size  and type is as follows:  Mat a= Mat Size 5,5 , CV_32F ;  You can create a new Matrix link with a stored buffer from third-party  libraries, without copying the data, using the following constructor:  Mat size, type, pointer_to_buffer   The supported types depend on the type of the number you want to store and the  number of channels. The most common types are as follows:  CV_8UC1 CV_8UC3 CV_8UC4 CV_32FC1 CV_32FC3 CV_32FC4  [ 41 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   An Introduction to the Basics of OpenCV  You can create any type of a matrix using CV_number_typeC n ,  where number_type is 8U  8 bits unsigned  to 64F  64 loat  and   n  is the number of channels. The number of channels allowed is  from 1 to CV_Cn_MAX.  This initialization does not set up the data values and you can get undesirable  values. To avoid undesirable values, you can initialize the matrix with zeros or ones  values with the zeros or ones function:  Mat mz= Mat::zeros 5,5, CV_32F ; Mat mo= Mat::ones 5,5, CV_32F ;  The output of the preceding matrix is as follows:  A special matrix initialization is the eye function that creates an identity matrix  with the speciied type  CV_8UC1, CV_8UC3…  and size:  Mat m= Mat::eye 5,5, CV_32F ;  The output is as follows:  [ 42 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   All matrix operations are allowed in the OpenCV Mat class. We can add or subtract  two matrices with + and - operators:  Chapter 2  Mat a= Mat::eye Size 3,2 , CV_32F ; Mat b= Mat::ones Size 3,2 , CV_32F ; Mat c= a+b; Mat d= a-b;  The results of the previous operations are as follows:  We can multiply a matrix by a scalar with the * operator, a matrix per element matrix  with the mul function, or a matrix by matrix multiplication with * operator:  Mat m1= Mat::eye 2,3, CV_32F ; Mat m2= Mat::ones 3,2, CV_32F ;    Scalar by matrix cout << "\nm1.*2\n" << m1*2 << endl;    matrix per element multiplication cout << "\n m1+2 .* m1+3 \n" <<  m1+1 .mul m1+3  << endl;    Matrix multiplication cout << "\nm1*m2\n" << m1*m2 << endl;  The results of the previous operations are as follows:  The other common mathematical matrix operations are transposition and matrix  inversion, deined by the t   and inv   functions, respectively.  [ 43 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   An Introduction to the Basics of OpenCV  Other interesting functions that OpenCV provides us with are array operations in a  matrix; for example, count the non-zero elements. This is useful to count the pixels or  area of an object:  int countnonZero  src  ;  OpenCV provides some statistical functions. The mean and standard deviation by  channel can be calculated using the meanStdDev function:  meanStdDev src, mean, stddev ;  The other useful statistical function is minMaxLoc. This function inds the minimum  and the maximum of a matrix or array and returns its location and value:  minMaxLoc src, minVal, maxVal, minLoc, maxLoc ;  Here, src is the input matrix, minVal and maxVal are double values detected, and  minLoc and maxLoc are point values detected.  Other core and useful functions are described in detail at   http:  docs.opencv.org modules core doc core.html.  Basic data persistence and storage Before we inish this chapter, we will explore the OpenCV functions to store   and read our data. In many applications, such as calibration or machine learning,  when we are done with the calculations, we need to save the results in order to  retrieve them in the next executions. For this purpose, OpenCV provides an   XML YAML persistence layer.  Writing to a ile storage To write a ile with some OpenCV data or other numeric data, we can use the  FileStorage class using the streaming c operator such as STL streaming:  include "opencv2 opencv.hpp" using namespace cv;  int main int, char** argv  {        create our writter  [ 44 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2      FileStorage fs "test.yml", FileStorage::WRITE ;        Save an int     int fps= 5;     fs << "fps" << fps;        Create some mat sample     Mat m1= Mat::eye 2,3, CV_32F ;      Mat m2= Mat::ones 3,2, CV_32F ;      Mat result=  m1+1 .mul m1+3 ;         write the result     fs << "Result" << result;        release the file     fs.release  ;      FileStorage fs2 "test.yml", FileStorage::READ ;      Mat r;     fs2["Result"] >> r;     std::cout << r << std::endl;      fs2.release  ;      return 0; }  To create a ile storage where we save the data, we only need to call the constructor  by giving a path ilename with the desired extension format  XML or YAML  with  the second parameter set to WRITE:  FileStorage fs "test.yml", FileStorage::WRITE ;  If we want to save the data, we only need to use the stream operator by giving an  identiier in the irst stage and the matrix or value that we want to save in the later  stage. For example, to save an int, we need to write the following code:  int fps= 5; fs << "fps" << fps;  A mat is as follows:  Mat m1= Mat::eye 2,3, CV_32F ; Mat m2= Mat::ones 3,2, CV_32F ; Mat result=  m1+1 .mul m1+3 ;    write the result fs << "Result" << result;  [ 45 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   An Introduction to the Basics of OpenCV  The result of the preceding code is in YAML format, which is as follows:  %YAML:1.0 fps: 5 Result: !!opencv-matrix    rows: 2    cols: 3    dt: f    data: [ 8., 3., 3., 3., 8., 3. ]  Reading from a saved ile previously is very similar to save functions:  include "opencv2 opencv.hpp" using namespace cv;  int main int, char** argv  {     FileStorage fs2 "test.yml", FileStorage::READ ;     Mat r;    fs2["Result"] >> r;    std::cout << r << std::endl;     fs2.release  ;     return 0; }  First, we have to open a saved ile with the FileStorage constructor using the  appropriate path and FileStorage::READ parameters:  FileStorage fs2 "test.yml", FileStorage::READ ;  To read any stored variable, we only need to use the common >> stream operator  using our FileStorage object and the identiier with the [] operator:  Mat r; fs2["Result"] >> r;  [ 46 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 2  Summary In this chapter, we learned the basics of how to access images and videos and how  they are stored in matrices.  We learned the basic matrix operations and other basic OpenCV classes to store  pixels, vectors, and so on.  Finally, we learned how to save our data in iles to allow them to be read in other  applications or executions.  In the next chapter, we will learn how to create our irst application by learning the  basics of a Graphical User Interface that OpenCV gives us. We will create buttons  and sliders and introduce some image processing basics.  [ 47 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Learning the Graphical User  Interface and Basic Filtering  In the previous chapter, we learned the basic classes and structures of OpenCV and  the most important class called Mat.  We learned how to read and save images, videos, and the internal structure in the  memory of images.  We are ready to work now, but we need to show our results and have some basic  interaction with our images. OpenCV provides us with a few basic user interfaces to  work with and help create our applications and prototypes.  To better understand how the user interface works, we are going to create a small  application called PhotoTool at the end of this chapter. In this application, we will  learn how to use ilters and color conversions.  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:     The basic OpenCV user interface    The OpenCV QT interface    Sliders and buttons    An advanced user interface—OpenGL    Color conversion    Basic filters  [ 49 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning the Graphical User Interface and Basic Filtering  Introducing the OpenCV user interface OpenCV has its own cross-operating system user interface that allows developers   to create their own applications without the need to learn complex libraries for the  user interface.  The OpenCV user interface is basic, but it gives Computer Vision developers the  basic functions to create and manage their software developments. All of them are  native and optimized for real-time use.  OpenCV provides two options for the user interface:     A basic interface based on native user interfaces, such as Cocoa or Carbon   for OS X and GTK for Linux or Windows user interfaces, that are selected by  default when you compile OpenCV.     A slightly more advanced interface based on the QT library that is cross-  platform. You have to enable the QT option manually in CMake before you  compile OpenCV.  [ 50 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 3  A basic graphical user interface with  OpenCV We are going to create a basic user interface with OpenCV. The OpenCV user  interface allows us to create windows, add images to it, move it, resize it, and   destroy it.  The user interface is in the OpenCV's module called highui:  include   include   include   using namespace std;     OpenCV includes include "opencv2 core.hpp" include "opencv2 highgui.hpp" using namespace cv;  const int CV_gUI_nORMAL= 0x10;  int main  int argc, const char** argv   {      Read images   Mat lena= imread ".. lena.jpg" ;   Mat photo= imread ".. photo.jpg" ;         Create windows   namedWindow "Lena", CV_gUI_nORMAL ;   namedWindow "Photo", WInDOW_AUTOSIZE ;       Move window   moveWindow "Lena", 10, 10 ;   moveWindow "Photo", 520, 10 ;         show images   imshow "Lena", lena ;   imshow "Photo", photo ;        Resize window, only non autosize   resizeWindow "Lena", 512, 512 ;        wait for any key press   waitKey 0 ;  [ 51 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning the Graphical User Interface and Basic Filtering       Destroy the windows   destroyWindow "Lena" ;   destroyWindow "Photo" ;       Create 10 windows   for int i =0; i< 10; i++    {     ostringstream ss;     ss << "Photo " << i;     namedWindow ss.str   ;     moveWindow ss.str  , 20*i, 20*i ;     imshow ss.str  , photo ;   }    waitKey 0 ;      Destroy all windows   destroyAllWindows  ;   return 0; }  Let's understand the code.  The irst task that we need to perform in order to enable a Graphical User Interface is  import the OpenCV's module highui:  include "opencv2 highgui.hpp"  Now, we are prepared to create our new windows, and then we need to load some  images that are to be shown:     Read images Mat lena= imread ".. lena.jpg" ; Mat photo= imread ".. photo.jpg" ;  To create the windows, we use the namedWindow function. This function has two  parameters: the irst parameter is a constant string with the window's name, and   the second parameter is the lags that we require, which is optional:  namedWindow "Lena", CV_gUI_nORMAL ; namedWindow "Photo", WInDOW_AUTOSIZE ;  In our case, we create two windows: the irst window is called Lena and the second  is called Photo.  [ 52 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 3  By default, there are the three lags for QT and native interfaces:     WInDOW_nORMAL: This flag allows the user to resize the window    WInDOW_AUTOSIZE: If this flag is set, the window size is automatically   adjusted to fit the display image and it is not possible to resize the window     WInDOW_OPEngL: This flag enables OpenGL support  QT has some more lags, which are as follows:     WInDOW_FREERATIO or WInDOW_KEEPRATIO: If set to WInDOW_FREERATIO, then  the image is adjusted with no respect to its ratio. If set to WInDOW_FREERATIO,  then the image is adjusted with respect to its ratio.     CV_gUI_nORMAL or CV_gUI_EXPAnDED: The first flag enables the basic   interface without the status bar and toolbar. The second flag enables the most  advanced graphical user interface with the status bar and toolbar.  If we compile OpenCV with QT, all the windows that we create are,  by default, in the expanded interface, but we can use native and  more basic interfaces by adding the CV_gUI_nORMAL lag. By default, the lags are WInDOW_AUTOSIZE, WInDOW_KEEPRATIO,  and CV_gUI_EXPAnDED.  When we create multiple windows, they are superimposed one above the other, but  we can move the windows to any area of our desktop with the moveWindow function:  In our code, we move the Lena window to the left 10 pixels 10 pixels to the top; and  the Photo window to the left 520 pixels and 10 pixels to the top:     Move window moveWindow "Lena", 10, 10 ; moveWindow "Photo", 520, 10 ;     show images imshow "Lena", lena ; imshow "Photo", photo ;     Resize window, only non autosize resizeWindow "Lena", 512, 512 ;   After showing the images that we loaded previously with the imshow function,   we resize the Lena window to 512 pixels, calling the resizeWindow function.   This function has three parameters: window name, width, and height.  [ 53 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning the Graphical User Interface and Basic Filtering  The speciic window size is for the image area. Toolbars are not  counted. Only windows without the enabled WInDOW_AUTOSIZE  lag can be resized.  After waiting for a key press with the waitKey function, we will remove or delete  our windows with the destroyWindow function in which the name of the window is  the only parameter that is required:  waitKey 0 ;     Destroy the windows destroyWindow "Lena" ; destroyWindow "Photo" ;  OpenCV has a function that is used to remove all the windows that we create in  only one call. The function is called destroyAllWindows. To show how this function  works, in our sample we create 10 windows and wait for a key press. When the  user presses any key, we destroy all the windows. Anyway, OpenCV automatically  handles the destruction of all the windows when the application is terminated, and it  is not necessary to call this function at the end of our application:     Create 10 windows for int i =0; i< 10; i++  {   ostringstream ss;   ss << "Photo " << i;   namedWindow ss.str   ;   moveWindow ss.str  , 20*i, 20*i ;   imshow ss.str  , photo ; }  waitKey 0 ;    Destroy all windows destroyAllWindows  ;  The result of this code can be seen in the following images in two steps. The irst  image shows two windows:  [ 54 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 3  After pressing any key, the application continues and draws several windows by  changing their positions:  [ 55 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning the Graphical User Interface and Basic Filtering  The graphical user interface with QT The QT user interface gives us more control and options to work with our images.  The interface is divided into three main areas:     The toolbar    The image area    The status bar  The toolbar has the following buttons from left to right:     Four buttons for panning    Zoom x1    Zoom x30 and show labels    Zoom in  [ 56 ]  www.it-ebooks.info      Zoom out    Save the current image    Show the properties windows  These options can be seen more clearly in the following screenshot:  Chapter 3  The image area shows an image and a contextual menu when we push the right  mouse button over the image. This area can show an overlay message at the top of  the area using the displayOverlay function. This function accepts three parameters:  the window name, the text that we want to show, and the period in milliseconds  when the overlay text is displayed. If the time is set to 0, the text never disappears:     Display Overlay displayOverlay "Lena", "Overlay 5secs", 5000 ;  [ 57 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning the Graphical User Interface and Basic Filtering  Finally, the status bar shows the bottom part of the window, the pixel value, and the  position of the coordinates in the image:  We can use the status bar to show messages, such as an overlay. The function that  can change the status bar message is displayStatusBar. This function has the same  parameters as overlay functions: the window name, the text to show, and the period  of time to show it:  Adding slider and mouse events to our  interfaces Mouse events and slider controls are very useful in Computer Vision and OpenCV.  Using these controls, users can interact directly with the interface and change the  properties of their input images or variables.  [ 58 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   In this section, we are going to introduce you to the concepts of adding slider and  mouse events for basic interactions. To understand this correctly, we will create a  small project, where we paint green circles in the image using the mouse events and  blur the image with the slider:     Create a variable to save the position value in track int blurAmount=15;  Chapter 3     Trackbar call back function static void onChange int pos, void* userInput ;    Mouse callback static void onMouse  int event, int x, int y, int, void* userInput  ;  int main  int argc, const char** argv   {      Read images   Mat lena= imread ".. lena.jpg" ;         Create windows   namedWindow "Lena" ;         create a trackbark   createTrackbar "Lena", "Lena", &blurAmount, 30, onChange, &lena ;      setMouseCallback "Lena", onMouse, &lena ;       Call to onChange to init   onChange blurAmount, &lena ;           wait app for a key to exit   waitKey 0 ;         Destroy the windows   destroyWindow "Lena" ;      return 0; }  Let's understand the code!  [ 59 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning the Graphical User Interface and Basic Filtering  First, we create a variable to save the slider position, and then we need to save the  slider position for access from other functions:     Create a variable to save the position value in track int blurAmount=15;  Now, we deine our callbacks for our slider and mouse events that are required for  the OpenCV setMouseCallbac and createTrackbar functions:     Trackbar call back function static void onChange int pos, void* userInput ;    Mouse callback static void onMouse  int event, int x, int y, int, void* userInput  ;  In the main function, we load an image and create a new window called Lena:  int main  int argc, const char** argv   {      Read images   Mat lena= imread ".. lena.jpg" ;         Create windows   namedWindow "Lena" ;  It is time to create the slider. OpenCV has the createTrackbar function that is used  to generate a slider with the following parameters in order:     The track bar name.    The window name.    An integer pointer to be used as a value; this parameter is optional. If the   pointer value is set, the slider gets this position during its creation.     The maximal position on the slider.    The callback function when the position slider changes.    The user data to be sent to the callback. It can be used to send data to   callbacks without using global variables:       create a trackbark   createTrackbar "Lena", "Lena", &blurAmount, 30, onChange,  &lena ;  [ 60 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 3  After creating the slider, we add the mouse events that allow you to paint circles  when the user pushes the left mouse button. OpenCV has the setMouseCallback  function. This function has three parameters, which are as follows:     The window name where we get the mouse events    The callback function to be called when there are mouse interactions    User data refers to any data that will be sent to the callback function when it's   fired. In our example, we'll send the entire Lena image:  setMouseCallback "Lena", onMouse, &lena ;  To inalize the main function, we only need to initialize the image with the same  parameter as the slider. To perform the initialization, we only need to call the  callback function manually and wait for events before we close the windows:  The slider callback applies a basic blur ilter to the image using the slider value as a  blur quantity:       Call to onChange to init   onChange blurAmount, &lena ;           wait app for a key to exit   waitKey 0 ;         Destroy the windows   destroyWindow "Lena" ;     Trackbar call back function static void onChange int pos, void* userData  {   if pos <= 0      return;      Aux variable for result   Mat imgBlur;       get the pointer input image   Mat* img=  Mat* userInput;       Apply a blur filter   blur *img, imgBlur, Size pos, pos  ;         Show the result   imshow "Lena", imgBlur ; }  [ 61 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning the Graphical User Interface and Basic Filtering  This function checks whether the slider value is 0 using the pos variable; in this case,  we do not apply the ilter because it generates a bad execution. We cannot apply a 0  pixels blur.  After checking the slider value, we create an empty matrix called imgBlur to store  the blur result.  To retrieve the image sent via the user data in the callback function, we have to cast  the void* userData to correct the pointer Mat* image type.  Now, we have the correct variables to be applied to the blur ilter. The blur function  applies a basic median ilter to an input image, *img in our case, to an output image.  The last parameter is the size of a blur kernel  a kernel is a small matrix used to  calculate the means of convolution between the kernel and image  that we want to  apply. In our case, we are using a squared kernel of the pos size.  Finally, we only need to update the image interface using the imshow function.  The mouse events callback has ive input parameters: the irst parameter deines the  event type, the second and third parameters deine the mouse position, the fourth  parameter deines the wheel movement, and the ifth parameter deines the user  input data.  The mouse event types are shown in the following table:  Event type EVEnT_MOUSEMOVE  EVEnT_LBUTTOnDOWn  EVEnT_RBUTTOnDOWn  EVEnT_MBUTTOnDOWn  EVEnT_LBUTTOnUP  EVEnT_RBUTTOnUP  EVEnT_MBUTTOnUP  EVEnT_LBUTTOnDBLCLK  EVEnT_RBUTTOnDBLCLK  EVEnT_MBUTTOnDBLCLK  EVEnTMOUSEWHEEL  EVEnT_MOUSEHWHEEL  Description  When the user moves the mouse  When the user pushes the left mouse button  When the user pushes the right mouse button  When the user pushes the middle mouse button  When the user releases the left mouse button  When the user releases the right mouse button  When the user releases the middle mouse button  When the user double-clicks with the left mouse button  When the user double-clicks with the right mouse button  When the user double-clicks with the middle mouse button  When the user does a vertical scroll with the mouse wheel  When the user does a horizontal scroll with the mouse wheel  [ 62 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 3  In our sample, we only go to manage events that come from a left-push mouse  button, and then any other event different from EVEnT_LBUTTOnDOWn is discarded.  After discarding other events, we get the input image, such as a slider callback, and  draw a circle in the image with the circle OpenCV function:    Mouse callback static void onMouse  int event, int x, int y, int, void* userInput   {   if  event != EVEnT_LBUTTOnDOWn             return;       get the pointer input image   Mat* img=  Mat* userInput;         Draw circle   circle *img, Point x, y , 10, Scalar 0,255,0 , 3 ;       Call on change to get blurred image   onChange blurAmount, img ;  }  Adding buttons to a user interface In the previous chapter, we learned how to create normal or QT interfaces and  interact with them with a mouse and slider, but we can create different types of  buttons as well.  Buttons are only supported in QT Windows.  The types of buttons supported are as follows:     The push button    The checkbox    The radiobox  The buttons only appear in the control panel. The control panel is an independent  window per program, where we can attach buttons and track bars.  [ 63 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning the Graphical User Interface and Basic Filtering  To show the control panel, we can push the last toolbar button, right-click on   any part of the QT window, and select the Display properties window or the   Ctrl + P shortcut.  Let's see how to create a basic sample with buttons. The code is large, and we  will irst explain the main function and later explain each callback separately to  understand each one of them:  Mat img; bool applygray=false; bool applyBlur=false; bool applySobel=false; … int main  int argc, const char** argv   {      Read images   img= imread ".. lena.jpg" ;         Create windows   namedWindow "Lena" ;         create Buttons   createButton "Blur", blurCallback, nULL, QT_CHECKBOX, 0 ;    createButton "gray",grayCallback,nULL,QT_RADIOBOX, 0 ;   createButton "RgB",bgrCallback,nULL,QT_RADIOBOX, 1 ;    createButton "Sobel",sobelCallback,nULL,QT_PUSH_BUTTOn, 0 ;         wait app for a key to exit   waitKey 0 ;         Destroy the windows   destroyWindow "Lena" ;      return 0; }  We are going to apply three types of blur iters, a sobel iter, and a color conversion  to gray. All these ilters are optional and the user can choose each one of them using  the buttons that we are going to create. Then, in order to get the status of each ilter,  we create three global Boolean variables:  bool applygray=false; bool applyBlur=false; bool applySobel=false;  [ 64 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   In the main function after we load the image and create the window, we have to use  the createButton function to create each button.  There are three button types deined in OpenCV, which are as follows:  Chapter 3     QT_CHECKBOX    QT_RADIOBOX    QT_PUSH_BUTTOn  Each button has ive parameters with the following order:     The button name    The callback function    A pointer to user variable data passed to callback    The button type    The default initialized state used for the checkbox and radiobox    button types     Then, we create a blur checkbox button, two radio buttons for color   conversion, and a push button for the Sobel filter:      create Buttons   createButton "Blur", blurCallback, nULL, QT_CHECKBOX, 0 ;    createButton "gray",grayCallback,nULL,QT_RADIOBOX, 0 ;   createButton "RgB",bgrCallback,nULL,QT_RADIOBOX, 1 ;    createButton "Sobel",sobelCallback,nULL,QT_PUSH_BUTTOn,       0 ;     This is the most important part of the main function. We are going to    explore the callback functions. Each callback changes its status variable to  call another function called applyFilters and adds the filters activated by  the input image: void grayCallback int state, void* userData  {   applygray= true;   applyFilters  ; } void bgrCallback int state, void* userData  {   applygray= false;   applyFilters  ; }  [ 65 ]  www.it-ebooks.info      The applyFilters function checks the status variable for each filter:  Learning the Graphical User Interface and Basic Filtering  void blurCallback int state, void* userData  {   applyBlur=  bool state;   applyFilters  ; }  void sobelCallback int state, void* userData  {   applySobel= !applySobel;   applyFilters  ; }  void applyFilters  {   Mat result;   img.copyTo result ;   if applygray {     cvtColor result, result, COLOR_BgR2gRAY ;   }   if applyBlur {     blur result, result, Size 5,5  ;     }   if applySobel {     Sobel result, result, CV_8U, 1, 1 ;     }   imshow "Lena", result ; }  To change the color to gray, we use the cvtColor function that accepts three  parameters: an input image, an output image, and the color conversion type.  The most useful color spaces conversions are as follows:     RGB or BGR to gray  COLOR_RgB2gRAY, COLOR_BgR2gRAY     RGB or BGR to YcrCb  or YCC   COLOR_RgB2YCrCb, COLOR_BgR2YCrCb     RGB or BGR to HSV  COLOR_RgB2HSV, COLOR_BgR2HSV     RGB or BGR to Luv  COLOR_RgB2Luv, COLOR_BgR2Luv     Gray to RGB or BGR  COLOR_gRAY2RgB, COLOR_gRAY2BgR   We can see that the code is easy to memorize.  [ 66 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 3  Remember that OpenCV works, by default, with the BGR format,  and the color conversion is different for RGB and BGR, when  converting to gray. Some developers think that gray equals  R+G+B 3, but the optimal gray value is called luminosity and has  the formula 0.21*R + 0.72*G + 0.07*B.  The blur ilter was described in the previous section. Finally, if the applySobel  variable is true, we apply the sobel ilter.  The sobel ilter is an image derivatives that uses the sobel operator, commonly   used to detect edges. OpenCV allow us to generate different derivatives with  different kernel sizes, but the most common is a 3x3 kernel used to calculate the   x derivatives or y derivatives.  The most important sobel parameters are as follows:     An input image    An output image    An output image depth  CV_8U, CV_16U, CV_32F, CV_64F     The order of the derivatives x    The order of the derivatives y    The kernel size  3 value by default     To generate a 3x3 kernel and first x order derivatives, we have to use the   following parameters: Sobel input, output, CV_8U, 1, 0 ;     To generate the y order derivatives, we use the following parameters:  Sobel input, output, CV_8U, 0, 1 ;  In our example, we use the x and y derivatives simultaneously to overwrite   the input:  Sobel result, result, CV_8U, 1, 1 ;  [ 67 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning the Graphical User Interface and Basic Filtering  The output of the x and y derivatives is as shown:  OpenGL support OpenCV includes OpenGL support. OpenGL is a graphical library that is integrated  in graphic cards as a standard. OpenGL allow us to draw from 2D to complex 3D  scenes.  OpenCV includes OpenGL support due to the importance of representing 3D   spaces in some tasks. To allow a window support in OpenGL, we have to set up   the WInDOW_OPEngL lag when we create the window with the namedWindow call.  The following code creates a window with OpenGL support and draws a rotated  plane that shows the web camera frames:  Mat frame; gLfloat angle= 0.0; gLuint texture;   [ 68 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 3  VideoCapture camera;  int loadTexture   {      if  frame.data==nULL  return -1; glgenTextures 1, &texture ;    glBindTexture  gL_TEXTURE_2D, texture  ;     glTexParameteri gL_TEXTURE_2D,gL_TEXTURE_MAg_FILTER,gL_LInEAR ;    glTexParameteri gL_TEXTURE_2D,gL_TEXTURE_MIn_FILTER,gL_LInEAR ;    glPixelStorei gL_UnPACK_ALIgnMEnT, 1 ;     glTexImage2D gL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, gL_RgB, frame.cols, frame.rows,0,  gL_BgR, gL_UnSIgnED_BYTE, frame.data ;    return 0;  }  }  void on_opengl void* param  {     glLoadIdentity  ;          Load frame Texture     glBindTexture  gL_TEXTURE_2D, texture  ;         Rotate plane before draw     glRotatef  angle, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f  ;        Create the plane and set the texture coordinates     glBegin  gL_QUADS ;            first point and coordinate texture      glTexCoord2d 0.0,0.0 ;       glVertex2d -1.0,-1.0 ;             seccond point and coordinate texture      glTexCoord2d 1.0,0.0 ;       glVertex2d +1.0,-1.0 ;             third point and coordinate texture      glTexCoord2d 1.0,1.0 ;       glVertex2d +1.0,+1.0 ;            last point and coordinate texture      glTexCoord2d 0.0,1.0 ;       glVertex2d -1.0,+1.0 ;     glEnd  ;  [ 69 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning the Graphical User Interface and Basic Filtering  int main  int argc, const char** argv   {        Open WebCam     camera.open 0 ;     if !camera.isOpened            return -1;         Create new windows     namedWindow "OpengL Camera", WInDOW_OPEngL ;             Enable texture     glEnable  gL_TEXTURE_2D  ;        setOpenglDrawCallback "OpengL Camera", on_opengl ;      while waitKey 30 !='q' {         camera >> frame;            Create first texture         loadTexture  ;         updateWindow "OpengL Camera" ;         angle =angle+4;     }              Destroy the windows   destroyWindow "OpengL Camera" ;      return 0; }  Mat frame; gLfloat angle= 0.0; gLuint texture;  VideoCapture camera;  camera.open 0 ;     if !camera.isOpened            return -1;  [ 70 ]  Let's understand the code.  The irst task is to create the required global variables where we store the video  capture, save the frames, control the animation angle plane, and the OpenGL texture:  In our main function, we have to create the video camera capture to retrieve the  camera frames:  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 3  If the camera is opened correctly, then we have to create our window with OpenGL  support using the WInDOW_OPEngL lag:     Create new windows namedWindow "OpengL Camera", WInDOW_OPEngL ;  In our example, we want to draw the images in a plane that come from the web  camera, and then we need to enable the OpenGL textures:     Enable texture glEnable  gL_TEXTURE_2D  ;  Now, we are ready to draw with OpenGL in our window, but we need set up a  draw OpenGL callback such as a typical OpenGL application. OpenCV give us the  setOpengLDrawCallback function that has two parameters: the window name and  the callback function:  setOpenglDrawCallback "OpengL Camera", on_opengl ;  With the OpenCV window and callback function deined, we need to create a loop  to load the texture and update the window content by calling the OpenGL draw  callback; inally, we need to update the angle position.  To update the window content, we use the OpenCV function update window with  the window name as the parameter:  while waitKey 30 !='q' {         camera >> frame;            Create first texture         loadTexture  ;         updateWindow "OpengL Camera" ;         angle =angle+4;     }  We are in the loop while the user press the q key.  Before we compile our application sample, we need to deine the loadTexture  function and our on_opengl callback draw function.  The loadTexture function converts our Mat frame to an OpenGL texture image that  is ready to be loaded and used in each callback drawing. Before we load the image as  a texture, we need to ensure that we have data in our frame matrix to check whether  the data variable object is not empty:  if  frame.data==nULL  return -1;  [ 71 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning the Graphical User Interface and Basic Filtering  If we have data in our matrix frame, then we can create the OpenGL texture binding  and set the OpenGL texture parameters as a linear interpolation:  glgenTextures 1, &texture ;  glBindTexture  gL_TEXTURE_2D, texture  ;     glTexParameteri gL_TEXTURE_2D,gL_TEXTURE_MAg_FILTER,gL_LInEAR ;     glTexParameteri gL_TEXTURE_2D,gL_TEXTURE_MIn_FILTER,gL_LInEAR ;  Now, we need to deine how the pixels are stored in our matrix and how to generate  the pixels with the OpenGL's glTexImage2D function. It's very important to note that  OpenGL uses the RGB format and OpenCV has the BGR format by default, and we  need to set it up correctly in this function:  glPixelStorei gL_UnPACK_ALIgnMEnT, 1 ; glTexImage2D gL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, gL_RgB, frame.cols, frame.rows,0, gL_ BgR, gL_UnSIgnED_BYTE, frame.data ;     return 0;  Now, we only need to inish drawing our plane for every callback when we call the  updateWindow in the main loop. We use the common OpenGL functions, and then  we load the identity OpenGL matrix to reset all our previous changes:  glLoadIdentity  ;  Load the frame texture into the memory:         Load Texture     glBindTexture  gL_TEXTURE_2D, texture  ;   Before we draw our plane, we apply all the transformations to our scene; in our case,  we are going to rotate our plane in the  1, 1, 1  axis:         Rotate plane     glRotatef  angle, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f  ;  Now, we have the scene set correctly to draw our plane, so we will draw quads faces  and use glBegin gL_QUADS for this purpose:     Create the plane and set the texture coordinates     glBegin  gL_QUADS ;  [ 72 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   We draw a plane centered at the  0, 0  position with a two units of size. Then, we  have to deine the texture coordinate to be used and the vertex position using the  glTextCoord2D and glVertex2D functions:  Chapter 3         first point and coordinate texture  glTexCoord2d 0.0,0.0 ;   glVertex2d -1.0,-1.0 ;         seccond point and coordinate texture  glTexCoord2d 1.0,0.0 ;   glVertex2d +1.0,-1.0 ;         third point and coordinate texture  glTexCoord2d 1.0,1.0 ;   glVertex2d +1.0,+1.0 ;        last point and coordinate texture  glTexCoord2d 0.0,1.0 ;   glVertex2d -1.0,+1.0 ;     glEnd  ;  This OpenGL code is becoming obsolete, but it is important  to better understand the OpenCV and OpenGL integration  without the complex OpenGL code.

We can see the result in the following image:  [ 73 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning the Graphical User Interface and Basic Filtering  Summary In this chapter, we learned how to create different types of user interface to show  images or 3D interfaces using OpenGL. We learned how to create sliders and buttons  and draw in 3D. We learned some basic image processing ilters as well.  In the next chapter, we will learn how to construct a complete photo tool application  using all that we learned using the graphical user interface. We will also learn how to  apply multiple ilters to an input image.  [ 74 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Delving into Histograms   and Filters  In the previous chapter, we learned the basics of user interfaces in OpenCV using  QT or native libraries and how to use advanced OpenGL user interfaces. We learned  basic color conversions and ilters that helped us create our irst application.  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:     Histogram and histogram equalization    Look up tables    The blur and median blur    The Gaussian Canny filter    Image color equalization    Understanding conversion between image types  After we learn the basics of OpenCV and user interfaces, we will create our irst  complete application and a basic photo tool with the following functionalities   in this chapter:     Calculate and draw a histogram    Histogram equalization    The lomography camera effect    The cartoonize effect  This application will help you understand how to create a whole project from scratch  and understand the histogram concept. We will see how to equalize the histogram of  a color image and create two effects using a combination of ilters and the use of look  up tables.  [ 75 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Delving into Histograms and Filters  Generating a CMake script ile Before we start creating our source ile, we will generate the CMakeLists.txt ile  that will allow us to compile our project, structure, and executable. The following  cmake script is simple and basic but enough to compile and generate the executable:  cmake_minimum_required  VERSIOn 2.6   cmake_policy SET CMP0012 nEW   PROjECT Chapter4_Phototool    Requires OpenCV FInD_PACKAgE  OpenCV 3.0.0 REQUIRED    include_directories ${OpenCV_InCLUDE_DIRS}  link_directories ${OpenCV_LIB_DIR}   ADD_EXECUTABLE  ${PROjECT_nAME} main.cpp   TARgET_LInK_LIBRARIES  ${PROjECT_nAME} ${OpenCV_LIBS}    Let's try to understand the script ile.  The irst line indicates the minimum cmake version required to generate our project,  and the second line sets the CMP0012 policy variable to allow you to identify numbers  and Boolean constants and remove the CMake warning if it is not set:  cmake_minimum_required  VERSIOn 2.6  cmake_policy SET CMP0012 nEW   After these two lines, we deine the project name:  PROjECT Chapter4_Phototool   Of course, we need to include the OpenCV library. The irst thing to do is ind the  library and show a message about the OpenCV library version with the MESSAgE  function:   Requires OpenCV FInD_PACKAgE  OpenCV 3.0.0 REQUIRED   MESSAgE "OpenCV version : ${OpenCV_VERSIOn}"   If the library with the minimum version 3.0 is found, then we include the headers  and library iles in our project:  include_directories ${OpenCV_InCLUDE_DIRS}  link_directories ${OpenCV_LIB_DIR}   [ 76 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now, we only need to add the source iles that are to be compiled; in order to link  them to the OpenCV library, we use the project name variable as an executable name  and use only a single source ile called main.cpp:  ADD_EXECUTABLE  ${PROjECT_nAME} main.cpp   TARgET_LInK_LIBRARIES  ${PROjECT_nAME} ${OpenCV_LIBS}     Chapter 4  Creating the Graphical User Interface Before we start with the image processing algorithms, we will create the main user  interface for our application. We will use a QT-based user interface to allow us to  create single buttons.  The application receives one input parameter to load the image to be processed,   and we will create the following four buttons:     Show histogram    Equalize histogram    Lomography effect    Cartoonize effect  We can see the four results in the following screenshot:  [ 77 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Delving into Histograms and Filters  Let's develop our project. First of all, we will include the required OpenCV headers.  We deine an img matrix to store the input image, and create a constant string to  use the new command-line parser, which is only available in OpenCV 3.0. In this  constant, we allow only two input parameters: common help and the required   image input:     OpenCV includes include "opencv2 core utility.hpp" include "opencv2 imgproc.hpp" include "opencv2 highgui.hpp" using namespace cv;    OpenCV command line parser functions    Keys accecpted by command line parser const char* keys = {     "{help h usage ?   print this message}"     "{@image   Image to process}" };  The main function starts with the command-line parser variable. We then set the  instructions and print the help message. The following lines will help you set up   the help instructions for our inal executable:  int main  int argc, const char** argv   {     CommandLineParser parser argc, argv, keys ;     parser.about "Chapter 4. PhotoTool v1.0.0" ;       If requires help show     if  parser.has "help"       {         parser.printMessage  ;         return 0;     }  If the user doesn't require help, then we need to get the ile path image in an imgFile  variable string and check whether all the required parameters are added to the  parser.check   function:  String imgFile= parser.get  0 ;         Check if params are correctly parsed in his variables     if  !parser.check        {         parser.printErrors  ;         return 0;     }  [ 78 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now, we can read the image ile with the imread function and then create the  window in which the input image will be shown later using the namedWindow  function:  Chapter 4         Load image to process     img= imread imgFile ;        Create window     namedWindow "Input" ;  With the image loaded and window created, we only need to create the buttons  for our interface and link them to the callback functions. Each callback function  is deined in the source code, and we will explain them later in this chapter. We  will create the buttons with the createButton function with the QT_PUSH_BUTTOn  constant in the button style:         Create UI buttons     createButton "Show histogram", showHistoCallback, nULL, QT_PUSH_ BUTTOn, 0 ;     createButton "Equalize histogram", equalizeCallback, nULL, QT_ PUSH_BUTTOn, 0 ;     createButton "Lomography effect", lomoCallback, nULL, QT_PUSH_ BUTTOn, 0 ;     createButton "Cartonize effect", cartoonCallback, nULL, QT_PUSH_ BUTTOn, 0 ;  To complete our main function, we show the input image and wait for a key press to  inish our application:         Show image     imshow "Input", img ;     waitKey 0 ;     return 0;  Now, we only need to deine the callback functions in the following sections,   and we will deine and describe each one of them.  Drawing a histogram A histogram is a statistical graphic representation of variable distribution. This  allows us to understand the density estimation and probability distribution of data.  The histogram is created by dividing the entire range of variable values into a ixed  number of intervals and then counting how many values fall into each interval.  [ 79 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Delving into Histograms and Filters  If we apply this histogram concept to an image, it seems to be complex to  understand, but it is really very simple. In a gray image, our variable values can  take any possible gray value ranging from 0 to 255, and the density is the number  of pixels in the image that have this value. This means that we have to count the  number of image pixels that have the value 0, count the number of pixels of value 1,  and so on.  The callback function that shows the histogram of the input image is called  showHistoCallback. This function calculates the histogram of each channel   image and shows the result of each histogram channel in a new image.  Now, let's check the following code:  void showHistoCallback int state, void* userData  {        Separate image in BRg     vector  bgr;     split  img, bgr  ;         Create the histogram for 256 bins        The number of possibles values [0..255]     int numbins= 256;          Set the ranges   for B,g,R   , last is not included     float range[] = { 0, 256 } ;     const float* histRange = { range };      Mat b_hist, g_hist, r_hist;      calcHist  &bgr[0], 1, 0, Mat  , b_hist, 1, &numbins,           &histRange  ;     calcHist  &bgr[1], 1, 0, Mat  , g_hist, 1, &numbins,           &histRange  ;     calcHist  &bgr[2], 1, 0, Mat  , r_hist, 1, &numbins,           &histRange  ;         Draw the histogram        We go to draw lines for each channel     int width= 512;     int height= 300;        Create image with gray base     Mat histImage  height, width, CV_8UC3, Scalar 20,20,20   ;  [ 80 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 4       normalize the histograms to height of image   normalize b_hist, b_hist, 0, height, nORM_MInMAX  ;   normalize g_hist, g_hist, 0, height, nORM_MInMAX  ;   normalize r_hist, r_hist, 0, height, nORM_MInMAX  ;    int binStep= cvRound  float width  float numbins ;   for  int i=1; i< numbins; i++    {     line  histImage,        Point  binStep* i-1 , height-cvRound b_hist.at  i-1     ,         Point  binStep* i , height-cvRound b_hist.at  i     ,           Scalar 255,0,0  ;     line  histImage,        Point  binStep* i-1 , height-cvRound g_hist.at  i-1     ,         Point  binStep* i , height-cvRound g_hist.at  i     ,           Scalar 0,255,0  ;     line  histImage,        Point  binStep* i-1 , height-cvRound r_hist.at  i-1     ,         Point  binStep* i , height-cvRound r_hist.at  i     ,           Scalar 0,0,255  ;     }     imshow "Histogram", histImage ; }  Let's try to understand how to extract each channel histogram and how to draw it.  First, we need to create three matrices to process each input image channel. We use  a vector type variable to store each one, and use the split OpenCV function to divide  the input image into three channels:     Separate image in BRg     vector  bgr;     split  img, bgr  ;  Now, we will deine the number of bins in our histogram; in our case, one bin per  possible pixel value:  int numbins= 256;  Now, we need to deine our range of variables and create three matrices to store   each histogram:          Set the ranges   for B,g,R        float range[] = { 0, 256 } ;     const float* histRange = { range };     Mat b_hist, g_hist, r_hist;  [ 81 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Delving into Histograms and Filters  Now, we can calculate the histogram using the OpenCV calcHist function.   This function has several parameters, which are as follows:     The input image; in our case, we use one image channel stored in the       The number of images required to calculate the histogram in the input; in our   bgr vector  case, we only use one image  we use 0 in our case     The dimensions of the number channel used to compute the histogram;       The optional mask matrix    The variable used to store the calculated histogram    The histogram dimensionality  the dimension of the space where the image    here, it's a gray plane  takes its values ; in our case, it's 1     The number of bins to be calculated; in our case, we use 256 bins, one per      The range of the input variable; in our case, it's a range of possible pixel   pixel value  values from 0 to 255  Our calcHist function for each channel looks like the following code:  calcHist  &bgr[0], 1, 0, Mat  , b_hist, 1, &numbins, &histRange  ;     calcHist  &bgr[1], 1, 0, Mat  , g_hist, 1, &numbins,           &histRange  ;     calcHist  &bgr[2], 1, 0, Mat  , r_hist, 1, &numbins,         &histRange  ;  Now, we have calculated the histogram for each channel. We need to draw each  channel histogram and show it to the user. To do this, we will create a color image  with a size of 512 x 300 pixels:     Draw the histogram        We go to draw lines for each channel     int width= 512;     int height= 300;        Create image with gray base     Mat histImage  height, width, CV_8UC3, Scalar 20,20,20   ;  [ 82 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Before we draw the histogram values in our image, we will normalize the histogram  matrices between the min value 0 and a max value; in our case, the same value as that  of the height of our image, 300 pixels:  Chapter 4         normalize the histograms to height of image     normalize b_hist, b_hist, 0, height, nORM_MInMAX  ;     normalize g_hist, g_hist, 0, height, nORM_MInMAX  ;     normalize r_hist, r_hist, 0, height, nORM_MInMAX  ;  Now, we need to draw a line from bin 0 to bin 1 and so on. We need to calculate the  number of pixels between each bin, and then a binStep variable is calculated by  dividing the width by the number of bins.  Each small line is drawn from the horizontal position, i-1 to i, and the vertical  position is the histogram value in the corresponding i. It is drawn with the color  channel representation, which is as follows:  int binStep= cvRound  float width  float numbins ;   for  int i=1; i< numbins; i++    {     line  histImage,        Point  binStep* i-1 , height-cvRound b_hist.at  i-1     ,         Point  binStep* i , height-cvRound b_hist.at  i     ,           Scalar 255,0,0  ;     line  histImage,        Point  binStep* i-1 , height-cvRound g_hist.at  i-1     ,         Point  binStep* i , height-cvRound g_hist.at  i     ,           Scalar 0,255,0  ;     line  histImage,        Point  binStep* i-1 , height-cvRound r_hist.at  i-1     ,         Point  binStep* i , height-cvRound r_hist.at  i     ,           Scalar 0,0,255  ;     }  Finally, we show the histogram image with the imshow function:      imshow "Histogram", histImage ;  [ 83 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Delving into Histograms and Filters  This is the result of the lena.png image:  Image color equalization In this section, we will learn how to equalize a color image. Image equalization  and histogram equalization try to obtain a histogram with a uniform distribution  of values. The result of equalization is an increase in the contrast of an image. The  equalization allows lower local contrast areas to gain higher contrast, spreading out  the most frequent intensities.  This method is very useful when the image is almost dark or completely bright and  there are very small differences between the background and foreground. Using  histogram equalization, we increase the contrast and the details that are over- or  under-exposed. This technique is very useful in medical images, such as X-rays.  However, there are two main disadvantages to this method: it increases the  background noise and decreases useful signals.  We can see the effect of equalization in the following image and see how the  histogram changes and spreads on increasing the image contrast:  [ 84 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 4  Let's try to implement our histogram equalization. We will implement it in the  callback function deined in the user interface's code:  void equalizeCallback int state, void* userData  {     Mat result;        Convert BgR image to YCbCr     Mat ycrcb;     cvtColor  img, ycrcb, COLOR_BgR2YCrCb ;         Split image into channels     vector  channels;     split  ycrcb, channels  ;             Equalize the Y channel only     equalizeHist  channels[0], channels[0]  ;         Merge the result channels     merge  channels, ycrcb  ;         Convert color ycrcb to BgR     cvtColor  ycrcb, result, COLOR_YCrCb2BgR  ;         Show image     imshow "Equalized", result ; }  [ 85 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Delving into Histograms and Filters  To equalize a color image, we only need to equalize the luminance channel. We  can do this with each color channel, but the result is not usable. Then, we can use  any other color image format, such as HSV or YCrCb, that separates the luminance  component in an individual channel. We choose this last color format and use a Y  channel  luminance  to equalize it. Then, we perform the following steps:  1.  We convert our input BGR image into YCrCb using the cvtColor function:  Mat result;        Convert BgR image to YCbCr     Mat ycrcb;     cvtColor  img, ycrcb, COLOR_BgR2YCrCb ;  2.  After converting our image, we split the YCrCb image into different   channels matrices:    Split image into channels     vector  channels;     split  ycrcb, channels  ;  3.  We then equalize the histogram only in the Y channel using the   equalizeHist function, which has only two parameters: input and   output matrices:        Equalize the Y channel only     equalizeHist  channels[0], channels[0]  ;  4.  Now, we only need to merge the resulted channels and convert the result to   the BGR format to show the user the result:         Merge the result channels     merge  channels, ycrcb  ;         Convert color ycrcb to BgR     cvtColor  ycrcb, result, COLOR_YCrCb2BgR  ;         Show image     imshow "Equalized", result ;  [ 86 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The process applied to a low contrast Lena image will have the   following result:  Chapter 4  Lomography effect In this section, we will create another image effect, a photographic effect that is  commonly used in different mobile applications, such as Google Camera   or Instagram.  In this section, we will discover how to use a Look up Table or LUT. We will discuss  LUTs later in this chapter.  We will learn how to add an over image; in this case, a dark halo to create our  desired effect.  [ 87 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Delving into Histograms and Filters  The function that implements this effect is the callback lomoCallback and has the  following code:  void lomoCallback int state, void* userData  {     Mat result;      const double exponential_e = std::exp 1.0 ;        Create Lookup table for color curve effect     Mat lut 1, 256, CV_8UC1 ;     for  int i=0; i<256; i++      {         float x=  float i 256.0;          lut.at  i = cvRound  256 *  1  1 + pow exponential_e,  -  x-0.5  0.1       ;     }            Split the image channels and apply curve transform only to red  channel     vector  bgr;     split img, bgr ;     LUT bgr[2], lut, bgr[2] ;        merge result     merge bgr, result ;            Create image for halo dark     Mat halo  img.rows, img.cols, CV_32FC3, Scalar 0.3,0.3,0.3   ;        Create circle      circle halo, Point img.cols 2, img.rows 2 , img.cols 3,  Scalar 1,1,1 , -1 ;      blur halo, halo, Size img.cols 3, img.cols 3  ;             Convert the result to float to allow multiply by 1 factor     Mat resultf;     result.convertTo resultf, CV_32FC3 ;             Multiply our result with halo     multiply resultf, halo, resultf ;             convert to 8 bits     resultf.convertTo result, CV_8UC3 ;         show result     imshow "Lomograpy", result ; }  Let's understand the code.  [ 88 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 4  The lomography effect is divided into different steps, but in our example we applied  a very simple lomography effect using the following two steps:  1.  A color manipulation with a look up table that applies a curve to the    red channel  2.  A vintage effect that applies a dark halo to the image.  The irst step is to manipulate the red color with a curve transform that applies   this function:  This formula generates a curve that makes the dark values darker and light values  lighter, where x is the possible pixel value  0 to 255  and s is a constant that we set  to 0.1 in our tutorial. A lower constant value that generates pixels with values lower  than 128 is very dark and over 128 is very bright. Values that are near to 1 convert  the curve to a line and do not generate our desired effect:  [ 89 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Delving into Histograms and Filters  This function is very easy to implement by applying a Look Up Table, more  commonly called a LUT. A LUT is a vector or table that returns a preprocess value  for a given value to perform computation in the memory. A LUT is a common  technique used to spare CPU cycles by avoiding performing costly computations  repeatedly. Instead of calling the exponential divide function for each pixel, we  perform it only once for each possible pixel value  256 times  and store the result  in a table. Thus, we save the CPU time at the cost of a bit of memory. While this  may not make a great difference for the standard PC with small image sizes, this  makes a huge difference for CPU-limited hardware, such as the Raspberry Pi. In our  case, if we want to apply our function for each pixel, we need to make the width by  calculating the height; in 100 x 100 pixels, there are 10,000 calculations, but there are  only 256 possible values for a pixel. We can then precalculate the pixel values and  save them in a LUT vector.  In our sample code, we deine the E variable and create a lut matrix of 1 row and 256  columns. Then, we do a loop over all possible pixel values by applying our formula  and saving them in the lut variable:  const double exponential_e = std::exp 1.0 ;        Create Lookup table for color curve effect     Mat lut 1, 256, CV_8UC1 ;     Uchar* plut= lut.data;     for  int i=0; i<256; i++      {         double x=  double i 256.0;          plut[i]= cvRound  256.0 *  1.0  1.0 + pow exponential_e, -              x-0.5  0.1       ;     }  As mentioned earlier, in this section we don't apply the function to all channels.   We need to split our input image by channels using the split function:         Split the image channels and apply curve transform only to red  channel     vector  bgr;     split img, bgr ;  We then apply our lut table variable to the red channel. OpenCV give us the LUT  function that has the following three parameters:     An input image    A matrix of a look up table    An output image  [ 90 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 4  Then, our call to the LUT function and red channels looks like this:  LUT bgr[2], lut, bgr[2] ;  Now, we only have to merge our computed channels:     merge result     merge bgr, result ;  The irst step is done, and we only have to create the dark halo to inish our   effect. Then, we create a gray image with a white circle inside with the same   input image size:     Create image for halo dark     Mat halo  img.rows, img.cols, CV_32FC3, Scalar 0.3,0.3,0.3   ;        Create circle      circle halo, Point img.cols 2, img.rows 2 , img.cols 3,   Scalar 1,1,1 , -1 ;   However, if we apply this image to our input image, it will change from dark to  white, and we can then apply a big blur using the blur ilter function to our circle  halo image to get a smooth effect:      blur halo, halo, Size img.cols 3, img.cols 3  ;  [ 91 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Delving into Histograms and Filters  The result after applying the blur ilter is shown in the following image:  Now, we need to apply this halo to our image from step 1. An easy way to do this is  to multiply both the images. But we need to convert our input image from an 8-bit  image to a 32-bit loat because we need to multiply our blurred image that has values  ranging from 0 to 1 by our input image that has integer values:         Convert the result to float to allow multiply by 1 factor     Mat resultf;     result.convertTo resultf, CV_32FC3 ;  After we convert our image, we only need to multiply each matrix per element:         Multiply our result with halo     multiply resultf, halo, resultf ;  Finally, we convert the loat image matrix result to an 8-bit image and show   the result:         convert to 8 bits     resultf.convertTo result, CV_8UC3 ;         show result     imshow "Lomograpy", result ;  [ 92 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 4  The cartoonize effect In the last section of this chapter, we create another effect called cartoonize. The  purpose of this effect is to create an image that looks like a cartoon. To do this,   we divide the algorithm into two steps: edge detection and color iltering.  The cartoonCallback functions deine this effect with the following code:  void cartoonCallback int state, void* userData  {      ** EDgES **         Apply median filter to remove possible noise     Mat imgMedian;     medianBlur img, imgMedian, 7 ;         Detect edges with canny     Mat imgCanny;     Canny imgMedian, imgCanny, 50, 150 ;             Dilate the edges     Mat kernel= getStructuringElement MORPH_RECT, Size 2,2  ;     dilate imgCanny, imgCanny, kernel ;  [ 93 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Delving into Histograms and Filters         Scale edges values to 1 and invert values     imgCanny= imgCanny 255;     imgCanny= 1-imgCanny;             Use float values to allow multiply between 0 and 1     Mat imgCannyf;     imgCanny.convertTo imgCannyf, CV_32FC3 ;         Blur the edgest to do smooth effect     blur imgCannyf, imgCannyf, Size 5,5  ;       ** COLOR **         Apply bilateral filter to homogenizes color     Mat imgBF;     bilateralFilter img, imgBF, 9, 150.0, 150.0 ;         truncate colors     Mat result= imgBF 25;     result= result*25;       ** MERgES COLOR + EDgES **         Create a 3 channles for edges     Mat imgCanny3c;     Mat cannyChannels[]={ imgCannyf, imgCannyf, imgCannyf};     merge cannyChannels, 3, imgCanny3c ;         Convert color result to float      Mat resultf;     result.convertTo resultf, CV_32FC3 ;         Multiply color and edges matrices     multiply resultf, imgCanny3c, resultf ;         convert to 8 bits color     resultf.convertTo result, CV_8UC3 ;         Show image     imshow "Result", result ;  }  Let's try to understand the code.  [ 94 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The irst step is to detect the most important edges of the image. We need to remove  noise from the input image before we detect the edges. There are several ways  and methods to do this. We will use a median ilter to remove any possible small  noise, but we can use other methods such as Gaussian blur and so on. The OpenCV  function is called medianBlur and accepts three parameters: an input image, an  output image, and the kernel size  a kernel is a small matrix used to apply some  mathematical operation such as convolutional to an image .  Chapter 4  Mat imgMedian; medianBlur img, imgMedian, 7 ;  After removing any possible noise, we detect the strong edges with a canny ilter:     Detect edges with canny Mat imgCanny; Canny imgMedian, imgCanny, 50, 150 ;  The canny ilter accepts the following parameters:     An input image    An output image    The first threshold    The second threshold    The Sobel size aperture    The Boolean value to check whether to use a more accurate image    gradient magnitude  The smallest value between the irst and second threshold is used for edge linking.  The largest value is used to ind initial segments of strong edges. The solbel size  aperture is the kernel size of the sobel ilter that will be used in the algorithm.  After detecting the edges, we will apply a small dilation to join the broken edges:         Dilate the edges     Mat kernel= getStructuringElement MORPH_RECT, Size 2,2  ;     dilate imgCanny, imgCanny, kernel ;  Similar to what we did in the Lomography effect, we need to multiply our edges'  result image by the color image. Then, we require a pixel value between 0 and 1,   and so we divide the canny result by 256 and invert the edges to black:         Scale edges values to 1 and invert values     imgCanny= imgCanny 255;     imgCanny= 1-imgCanny;  [ 95 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Delving into Histograms and Filters  Transform the Canny 8 unsigned bit format to a loat matrix:         Use float values to allow multiply between 0 and 1     Mat imgCannyf;     imgCanny.convertTo imgCannyf, CV_32FC3 ;  To give a cool result, we can blur the edges to give a smooth result line, and then we  apply a blur ilter:     Blur the edgest to do smooth effect     blur imgCannyf, imgCannyf, Size 5,5  ;  The irst step of the algorithm is complete, and now we will work with the color.  To get a cartoon look and feel, we will use the bilateral ilter:     Apply bilateral filter to homogenizes color     Mat imgBF;     bilateralFilter img, imgBF, 9, 150.0, 150.0 ;  A bilateral ilter is a ilter used to reduce the noise of an image while keeping   edges, but we can get a cartoonish effect with appropriate parameters that we   will explore later.  The bilateral ilter parameters are as follows:     An input image    An output image    The diameter of a pixel neighborhood; if it's set to negative, it is computed   from a sigma space value     A sigma color value    A sigma coordinate space  With a diameter greater than 5, the bilateral ilter becomes slow.  With sigma values greater than 150, a cartoonish effect appears.  To create a stronger cartoonish effect, we truncate the possible color values to 10 by  dividing and multiplying the pixel values. For other values, and to better understand  the sigma parameters, read the OpenCV documentation:     truncate colors     Mat result= imgBF 25;     result= result*25;  [ 96 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 4  Finally, we need to merge the color and edges' results. Then, we need to create a  3-channel image from the irst step:     Create a 3 channles for edges     Mat imgCanny3c;     Mat cannyChannels[]={ imgCannyf, imgCannyf, imgCannyf};     merge cannyChannels, 3, imgCanny3c ;  Then, we convert our color result image to a 32 loat image and then multiply both  the images per element:         Convert color result to float      Mat resultf;     result.convertTo resultf, CV_32FC3 ;         Multiply color and edges matrices     multiply resultf, imgCanny3c, resultf ;     convert to 8 bits color     resultf.convertTo result, CV_8UC3 ;         Show image     imshow "Result", result ;  Finally, we only need to convert our image to an 8-bit image and show the resulting  image to the user:  In the following image, we can see the input image  the left-hand side image  and the  result after applying the cartoonize effect  the right-hand side image :  [ 97 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Delving into Histograms and Filters  Summary In this chapter, we learned how to create a complete project that manipulates images  after applying different effects. We also split a color image in multiple matrices in  order to apply effects to only one channel. We learned how to create look up tables,  merge multiple matrices in one, use a canny and bilateral ilter, draw circles, and  multiply images to perform halo effects.  In the next chapter, we will learn how to do object inspection and how to segment an  image in different parts and detect it.  [ 98 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Automated Optical  Inspection, Object  Segmentation, and Detection  In the previous chapter, we learned about histograms and ilters that allowed us to  understand image manipulation and create a photo application.  In this chapter, we will introduce you to the basic concepts of object segmentation  and detection, which means isolation the objects that appear in an image for future  processing and analysis.  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:     Noise removal    The basics of light background removal    The thresholding operation    A connected component for object segmentation    Finding contours for object segmentation  The industry sector uses complex Computer Vision systems and hardware.  Computer Vision tries to detect the problems and minimizes errors produced   in the production process and increases the quality of inal products.  [ 99 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Automated Optical Inspection, Object Segmentation, and Detection  In this sector, the name for Computer Vision tasks is Automated Optical Inspection  or AOI. This name appears in the inspection of printed circuit board manufacturers,  where one or more cameras scan each circuit to detect critical failures and quality  defects. This nomenclature was used by other manufacturers to use optical camera  systems and Computer Vision algorithms to increase the product quality. Nowadays,  the use of optical inspection using different camera types such as infrared, 3D  cameras, and so on depends on the problem requirements, such as measure objects,  detect surface effects, and so on; and complex algorithms are used in thousands of  industries for different purposes, such as defects detection, recognition, classiication,  and so on.  Isolating objects in a scene In this section, we will introduce you to the irst step of any AOI algorithm, that is,  isolating different parts or objects in a scene.  We will take the example of object detection and classiication of three object types:  a screw, a packing ring, and a nut and develop these in this chapter and Chapter 6,  Learning Object Classiication.  Let's say we are in a company that produces these three objects. All of them are in  the same carrier tape, and our objective is to detect each object in the carrier tape and  classify each one to allow a robot to put each object on the correct shelf:  [ 100 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 5  In this chapter, we will isolate each object and detect its position in the image in  pixels. In the next chapter, we will classify each isolated object to check whether   it is a nut, a screw, or a packing ring.  In the following image, we show our desired result where there are a few objects  in the left-hand side image, and in the right-hand side image, we draw each one  in different colors. We can show different features such as the area, height, width,  countour size, and so on.  To achieve this result, we will follow different steps that allow us to better  understand and organize our algorithm, as shown in the following diagram:  [ 101 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Automated Optical Inspection, Object Segmentation, and Detection  Our application is divided into two chapters. In this chapter, we will develop and  understand the preprocessing and segmentation steps. In Chapter 6, Learning Object  Classiication, we will extract the characteristics of each segmented object and train  our machine learning system algorithm to identify each object class to allow you to  classify our objects.  Our preprocessing steps are divided into three more substeps, which are as follows:     Noise removal    Lighting removal    Binarization  In the segmentation step, we will use two different algorithms, which are as follows:     The contour detection algorithm    The connected component extraction  labeling   We can see these substeps in the following diagram along with the application low:  Now, it's time to start the preprocessing step to get the best binarization image   by removing the noise and lighting effects in order to minimize the possible  detection errors.  [ 102 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                       Chapter 5  Creating an application for AOI To create our new application, we require a few input parameters when the user  executes them; all of them are optional, excluding the input image to be processed:     An input image to be processed    The light image pattern    The light operation, where the user can choose between difference or    division operations:  If the input value of the user is set to 0, then a difference operation   is applied  If the input value of the user is set to 1, then a division operation   is applied     Segmentation, where the user can choose between connected components   with or without statistics and findContours methods:  If the input value of the user is set to 1, then the connected  components method for the segment is applied  If the input value of the user is set to 2, then the connected  components with the statistics area is applied  If the input value of the user is set to 3, then the findContours  method is applied to the segmentation  To enable this user selection, we will use the command line parser class with   these keys:     OpenCV command line parser functions    Keys accecpted by command line parser const char* keys = {    "{help h usage ?   print this message}"    "{@image  Image to process}"    "{@lightPattern  Image light pattern to apply to image input}"    "{lightMethod  1  Method to remove background light, 0  difference, 1 div }"    "{segMethod  1  Method to segment: 1 connected Components, 2  connected components with stats, 3 find Contours }" };  [ 103 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Automated Optical Inspection, Object Segmentation, and Detection  We use the command line parser class that checks the parameters in the   main function:  int main  int argc, const char** argv   {   CommandLineParser parser argc, argv, keys ;   parser.about "Chapter 5. PhotoTool v1.0.0" ;     If requires help show   if  parser.has "help"     {       parser.printMessage  ;       return 0;   }    String img_file= parser.get  0 ;   String light_pattern_file= parser.get  1 ;   int method_light= parser.get  "lightMethod" ;   int method_seg= parser.get  "segMethod" ;         Check if params are correctly parsed in his variables   if  !parser.check      {       parser.printErrors  ;       return 0;   }  After parser class our command line user data, we check whether the input image is  correctly loaded, and then we load the image and check whether it has data:     Load image to process   Mat img= imread img_file, 0 ;   if img.data==nULL {     cout << "Error loading image "<< img_file << endl;     return 0;   }  Now, we are ready to create our AOI process of segmentation. We will start with the  preprocessing task.  Preprocessing the input image This section introduces you to some of the most common techniques that can be  applied to preprocess images in the context of object segmentation detection. The  preprocess is the irst change that we make in a new image before we start with our  work and extract the information that we require from it.  [ 104 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Normally, in the preprocessing step, we try to minimize the image noise, light  conditions, or image deformations due to the camera lens. These steps minimize   the errors when you try to detect objects or segment our image.  Chapter 5  Noise removal If we don't remove the noise, we can detect more objects than we expect because  normally noise is represented as a small point in the image and can be segmented as  an object. The sensor and scanner circuit normally produce this noise. This variation  of brightness or color can be represented in different types, such as Gaussian noise,  spike noise, and shot noise. There are different techniques that can be used to remove  the noise. We will use a smooth operation, but depending of the type on the noise,  we will use some that are better than others. For example, a median ilter is normally  used to remove the salt-pepper noise:  [ 105 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Automated Optical Inspection, Object Segmentation, and Detection  The left-hand side image is the original input with a salt-pepper noise. If we   apply a median blur, we get an awesome result where we lose small details. For  example, the borders of a screw for which we maintain the perfect edges. Refer to the  top-right igure. If we apply a box ilter or a Gaussian ilter, the  noise if not removed.  It is just smoothed and the details of objects are loosed and smoothed as well. Refer  to the bottom-right igure.  OpenCV provides us with the medianBlur function that requires the following   three parameters:     An input image with a 1, 3, or 4 channel image. When the kernel size is   greater than 5, the image depth can only be CV_8U.     An output image,which is the resulting image, that has the same type and      The kernel size that has the aperture size greater than 1 and an odd value.   depth as that of the input.  For example, 3, 5, 7.  This piece of code used to remove the noise looks like this:    Mat img_noise;   medianBlur img, img_noise, 3 ;  Removing the background using the light  pattern for segmentation In this section, we will develop a basic algorithm that enables us to remove the  background using a light pattern. This preprocessing gives us better segmentation.  Refer to the following igures. The top-left igure is the input image without noise,  and the top-right igure is the result of applying a thresholding operation; we can  see the top artifact. The bottom-left igure is the input image after the removal of the  background, the bottom-right igure is the thresholding result where there are no  artifacts in it and it's better to segment it.  [ 106 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 5  How can we remove the light from our image? It is very simple; we only need  a picture of our scenario without any object that is taken from exactly the same  position from where the other images have been taken, and to have the same light  conditions. This is a very common technique in AOI because the external   conditions are supervised and known. The image result of our case is similar   to the following igure:  [ 107 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Automated Optical Inspection, Object Segmentation, and Detection  Then, with a simple mathematical operation, we can remove this light pattern.   There are two options to remove it, which are as follows:     Difference    Division  R= L-I  R= 255* 1- I L    The difference images are the simplest approach. If we have the light pattern L and  the image picture I, the removal R result is the difference between them:  This division is a bit more complex but simple at the same time. If we have the light  pattern matrix L and the image picture matrix I, the removal R result is as follows:  In this case, we divide the image by the light pattern. We make the assumption that  if our light pattern is white and the objects are darker than the background carrier  tape, then the image pixel values will always remain the same or will be lower than  the light pixel values. Then, the result that we obtain from I L is between 0 and 1.  Finally, we invert the result of this division to get the same color direction range and  multiply it by 255 to get values between the 0-255 range.  In our code, we will create a new function called removeLight with the   following parameters:     An input image to remove the light background    Light pattern mat    Method, 0 is difference, 1 division  The output is a new image matrix without the light background.  The following code implements the background removal using the light pattern:  Mat removeLight Mat img, Mat pattern, int method  {   Mat aux;      if method is normalization   if method==1    {        Require change our image to 32 float for division     Mat img32, pattern32;     img.convertTo img32, CV_32F ;     pattern.convertTo pattern32, CV_32F ;        Divide the image by the pattern     aux= 1- img32 pattern32 ;  [ 108 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 5         Scale it to convert to 8bit format     aux=aux*255;        Convert 8 bits format     aux.convertTo aux, CV_8U ;   }else{     aux= pattern-img;   }   return aux; }  Let's try to understand this. After creating the aux variable, in order to save the  result, we select the method that is chosen by the user and passed via a parameter to  the function. If the method selected is 1, we apply the division method.  The division method requires a 32-bit loat image to allow us to divide the images.  The irst step is to convert the image and light pattern mat to 32-bit depth:     Require change our image to 32 float for division Mat img32, pattern32; img.convertTo img32, CV_32F ; pattern.convertTo pattern32, CV_32F ;  Now we can perform the mathematical operations in our matrix, as described,  dividing the image by the pattern and inverting the result:     Divide the image by the pattern aux= 1- img32 pattern32 ;    Scale it to convert o 8bit format aux=aux*255;  Now, we have the result, but we need to return an 8-bit depth image, and then,   use the convert function, as we did previously, to convert it to a 32-bit loat:     Convert 8 bits format aux.convertTo aux, CV_8U ;  Now we can return the aux variable with the result. For the difference method, the  development is very easy because we don't have to convert our images, we only  need to perform the difference and return. If we don't assume that the pattern is  equal to or greater than the image, then we will require a few checks and truncate  values that can be less than 0 or greater than 255:  aux= pattern-img;  [ 109 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Automated Optical Inspection, Object Segmentation, and Detection  The following igure is the result of applying the image light pattern to our   input image:  In the results that we obtain, we can check how the light gradient is removed and the  possible artifacts are removed as well.  However, what happens when we don't have a light background pattern? There  are a few different techniques to do this, and we are going to present the most  basic one. Using a ilter, we can create one that can be used, but there are better  algorithms from which you can learn the background from a few images, where the  pieces appear in different areas. This technique sometimes requires a background  estimation image initialization, where our basic approach can play very well. These  advanced techniques are explored in the video surveillance chapter.  To estimate the background image, we will use a blur with a large kernel size that  is applied to our input image. This is a common technique used in OCR where  the letters are thin and small relative to the whole document, and allows us to  perform an approximation of the light patterns in the image. We can see the light  background pattern reconstruction on the left-hand side igure and the ground truth  on the right-hand side igure:  [ 110 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 5  We can see that there are minor differences in the light patterns, but this result is  enough to remove the background, and we can see the result in the following igure  using difference images.  In the following igure, we can see the result of applying the image difference  between the original input image and the estimated background image that are  computed with the previous approach:  The calculateLightPattern function creates this light pattern or background  approximation:  Mat calculateLightPattern Mat img  {   Mat pattern;      Basic and effective way to calculate the light pattern from one  image   blur img, pattern, Size img.cols 3,img.cols 3  ;   return pattern; }  [ 111 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Automated Optical Inspection, Object Segmentation, and Detection  This basic function applies a blur to an input image using a big kernel size relative  to the image size. From the code, it is one-third of the original width and height.  The thresholding operation After removing the background, we only have to binarize the image for future  segmentation. Now, we will apply the threshold function using two different  threshold values: a very low value when we remove the light background because  all non-interest regions are black or very low values, and a medium value when we  do not use a light removal method because we have a white background and the  object images have lower values. This last option allows us to check the results with  and without the background removal:       Binarize image for segment   Mat img_thr;   if method_light!=2 {     threshold img_no_light, img_thr, 30, 255, THRESH_BInARY ;   }else{     threshold img_no_light, img_thr, 140, 255, THRESH_BInARY_InV ;   }  Now, we will continue with the most important part of our application: the  segmentation. We will use two different approaches or algorithms: connected  components and contours.  Segmenting our input image Now, we will introduce you to the following two techniques used to segment our  thresholded image:     The connected components    The findContours function  With these two techniques, we will be allowed to extract each region of interest of  our image where our target objects appear; in our case, a nut, screw, and ring.  The connected component algorithm The connected component is a very common algorithm used to segment and identify  parts in binary images. A connected component is an iterative algorithm used for  the purpose of labeling an image using an 8- or 4-connectivity pixel. Two pixels are  connected if they have the same value and are neighbors. In the following igure,  each pixel has eight neighbor pixels:  [ 112 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 5  A 4-connectivity means that only the 2, 4, 5, and 7 neighbors can be connected to the  center if they have the same value. In the case of 8-connectivity, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and  8 can be connected if they have the same value.  In the following example, we can see the difference between an eight and four  connectivity algorithm. We will apply each algorithm to the next binarized image.  We used a small 9 X 9 image and zoomed it to show how connected components,  and the difference between an 4- and 8-connectivity, work:  [ 113 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Automated Optical Inspection, Object Segmentation, and Detection  The 4-connectivity algorithm detects two objects, as shown on the left-hand side  image. The 8-connectivity algorithm detects only one object  the right-hand side  image  because two diagonal pixels are connected, whereas in a 4-connectivity  algorithm, only vertical and horizontal pixels are connected. We can see the result   in the following igure, where each object has a different gray color value:  OpenCV 3 introduces you to the connected components algorithm with the  following two different functions:     connectedComponents image, labels, connectivity=8, type=CV_32S     connectedComponentsWithStats image, labels, stats, centroids,   connectivity=8, ltype=CV_32S   Both the functions return an integer with the number of detected labels, where the  label 0 represents the background.  The difference between these two functions is basically the information that returns  each one. Let's check the parameters of each one. The connectedComponents  function give us the following parameters:  Image: This is the input image to be labeled.        Labels: This is a mat output with the same size of an input image, where   each pixel has the value of its label, and all 0's represent the background, the  pixels that have 1 as values represent the first connected component object,  and so on.     Connectivity: This has two possible values: 8 or 4 that represents the   connectivity we want to use.  [ 114 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 5     Type: This is the type of the label image that we would want to use: only two   types are allowed, CV32_S or CV16_U. By default, it is CV32_S.  The connectedComponentsWithStats function has two more parameters that are  deined: stats and centroids parameters:     Stats: This is an output parameter for each label, including the background  label. The following statistics values can be accessed via stats  label, column ,  where columns are defined as well, as follows:                      CC_STAT_LEFT: This is the leftmost x coordinate of a connected  component object  CC_STAT_TOP: This is the topmost y coordinate of a connected  component object  CC_STAT_WIDTH: This is the width of a connected component object  defined by its bounding box  CC_STAT_HEIgHT: This is the height of a connected component object  defined by its bounding box  CC_STAT_AREA: This is the number of pixels  area  of the connected  component object     Centroids: The centroid points in float type for each label inclusive of    the background  In our example application, we will create two functions that are to be applied to  these two OpenCV algorithms and show the user the obtained result in a new image  with colored objects in the basic algorithm and draw the area of the stats algorithm  for each object.  Let's deine the basic drawing of the connected component function:  void ConnectedComponents Mat img  {      Use connected components to divide our possibles parts of images    Mat labels;   int num_objects= connectedComponents img, labels ;      Check the number of objects detected   if num_objects < 2  {     cout << "no objects detected" << endl;     return;   }else{     cout << "number of objects detected: " << num_objects - 1 << endl;   }  [ 115 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Automated Optical Inspection, Object Segmentation, and Detection       Create output image coloring the objects   Mat output= Mat::zeros img.rows,img.cols, CV_8UC3 ;   Rng rng  0xFFFFFFFF  ;   for int i=1; i<num_objects; i++ {     Mat mask= labels==i;     output.setTo randomColor rng , mask ;   }   imshow "Result", output ; }  First of all, we call the OpenCV connectedComponents function that returns the  number of objects detected. If the number of objects is less than two, this means that  only the background object is detected, and then, we don't need to draw anything  and inish. If the algorithm detects more than one object, then we show the number  of objects detected via the terminal:  Mat labels;   int num_objects= connectedComponents img, labels ;      Check the number of objects detected   if num_objects < 2  {     cout << "no objects detected" << endl;     return;   }else{     cout << "number of objects detected: " << num_objects - 1 << endl;  Now, we will draw all the detected objects in a new image with different colors,  and then we need to create a new black image with the same input size and three  channels:  Mat output= Mat::zeros img.rows,img.cols, CV_8UC3 ;  Then, we need to loop over each label, except the 0 value because it's the   background label:  for int i=1; i<num_objects; i++ {  To extract each object from the label image, we need to create a mask for each label i  using a comparison, and save it in a new image:      Mat mask= labels==i;  Finally, we set a pseudo-random color to the output image using the mask:      output.setTo randomColor rng , mask ;   }  [ 116 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   After we loop all images, we have all the objects with different colors in our output  image, and we only have to show the output image:  mshow "Result", output ;  This is the result where each object is painted with a different color or gray value:  Chapter 5  Now, we will explain how to use the connected components with the stats OpenCV  algorithm and show some more information in the output result image. The  following function implements this functionality:  void ConnectedComponentsStats Mat img  {      Use connected components with stats   Mat labels, stats, centroids;   int num_objects= connectedComponentsWithStats img, labels, stats,  centroids ;      Check the number of objects detected   if num_objects < 2  {     cout << "no objects detected" << endl;     return;   }else{     cout << "number of objects detected: " << num_objects - 1 << endl;   }      Create output image coloring the objects and show area   Mat output= Mat::zeros img.rows,img.cols, CV_8UC3 ;   Rng rng  0xFFFFFFFF  ;   for int i=1; i<num_objects; i++ {     cout   i     i, CC_STAT_AREA  << endl;     Mat mask= labels==i;  [ 117 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Automated Optical Inspection, Object Segmentation, and Detection      output.setTo randomColor rng , mask ;        draw text with area     stringstream ss;     ss   i, CC_STAT_AREA ;      putText output,        ss.str  ,        centroids.at  i ,        FOnT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX,        0.4,        Scalar 255,255,255  ;   }   imshow "Result", output ; }  Let's understand the code, as we did in the non-stats function. We call the connected  components algorithm; but, in this case, using the stats function, we check whether  we can detect more than one object:  Mat labels, stats, centroids;   int num_objects= connectedComponentsWithStats img, labels, stats,  centroids ;      Check the number of objects detected   if num_objects < 2  {     cout << "no objects detected" << endl;     return;   }else{     cout << "number of objects detected: " << num_objects - 1 << endl;   }  Now we have two more output results: the stats and centroids variables.   Then, for each label that we detect, we will show its centroid and area via the  command line:  for int i=1; i<num_objects; i++ {     cout   i     i, CC_STAT_AREA  << endl;  You can check the call to the stats variable in order to extract the area using the  stats.at  I, CC_STAT_AREA  column constant.  Now, as mentioned earlier, we paint the output image of the object labeled with the  i number:  Mat mask= labels==i; output.setTo randomColor rng , mask ;  [ 118 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Finally, we need to add over the image, in the centroid of the object segmented,  some info like the area. To do this, we use the stats and centroid variables using  the putText function. First, we need to create a stringstream to add the stats area  information:  Chapter 5     draw text with area     stringstream ss;     ss   i, CC_STAT_AREA ;  Then, use the putText using the centroid as the text position:      putText output,        ss.str  ,        centroids.at  i ,        FOnT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX,        0.4,        Scalar 255,255,255  ;  The result of this function looks like this:  The indContours algorithm The findContours algorithm is one of the most frequently used OpenCV algorithms  to segment objects. This algorithm has been included in OpenCV since its irst  version and provides more information and descriptors, such as shapes, topological  organizations, and so on, to the developers:  void findContours InputOutputArray image, OutputArrayOfArrays  contours, OutputArray hierarchy, int mode, int method, Point  offset=Point     [ 119 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Automated Optical Inspection, Object Segmentation, and Detection  Let's explain each parameter, as follows:  Image: This is the input binary image.        Contours: This is the contours output where each detected contour is a vector   of points.     Hierarchy: This is the optional output vector where we store the hierarchy   of contours. This is the topology of the image where we can get the relations  between each contour.     Mode: This is the method used to retrieve the contours:  RETR_EXTERnAL: This retrieves only the external contours.  RETR_LIST: This retrieves all the contours without establishing   the hierarchy.  RETR_CCOMP: This retrieves all the contours with two levels of  hierarchy: external and holes. If another object is inside one hole, then  this is put on the top of the hierarchy.  RETR_TREE: This retrieves all the contours that create a full hierarchy  between contours.     Method: This allows you to perform the approximation method to retrieve   the contours' shapes:  CV_CHAIn_APPROX_nOnE: This does not apply any approximation to  the contours and stores all the contours points.  CV_CHAIn_APPROX_SIMPLE: This compresses all the horizontal,  vertical, and diagonal segments that store only the start and end  points.  CV_CHAIn_APPROX_TC89_L1,CV_CHAIn_APPROX_TC89_KCOS This  applies the Teh-Chin chain approximation algorithm.     Offset: This is the optional point value used to shift all the contours.   This is very useful when we work in a ROI and is required to retrieve   the global positions.                             Note The input image is modiied by the findContours function. Create a  copy of your image before it is sent to this function if you need it.  [ 120 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 5  Now that we know the parameters of the findContours function, let's apply them to  our example:  void FindContoursBasic Mat img  {   vector  > contours;   findContours img, contours, RETR_EXTERnAL, CHAIn_APPROX_SIMPLE ;   Mat output= Mat::zeros img.rows,img.cols, CV_8UC3 ;      Check the number of objects detected   if contours.size   == 0  {     cout << "no objects detected" << endl;     return;   }else{     cout << "number of objects detected: " << contours.size   << endl;   }   Rng rng  0xFFFFFFFF  ;   for int i=0; i<contours.size  ; i++      drawContours output, contours, i, randomColor rng  ;   imshow "Result", output ; }  Let's understand our implementation line by line.  In our case, we don't require any hierarchy, so we will retrieve only the external  contours of all possible objects. To do this, we use the RETR_EXTERnAL mode, and  we use the basic contour encoding scheme using the CHAIn_APPROX_SIMPLE method:  vector  > contours; vector  hierarchy; findContours img, contours, RETR_EXTERnAL, CHAIn_APPROX_SIMPLE ;  Similar to the connected components examples mentioned earlier, we irst check how  many contours we have retrieved. If there are none, then we exit from our function:     Check the number of objects detected   if contours.size   == 0  {     cout << "no objects detected" << endl;     return;   }else{     cout << "number of objects detected: " << contours.size   << endl;   }  [ 121 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Automated Optical Inspection, Object Segmentation, and Detection  Finally, we draw each detected contour that we detect, and we draw it in our output  image with a different color. To do this, OpenCV provides us with a function to  draw the result of the ind contours image:  for int i=0; i<contours.size  ; i++      drawContours output, contours, i, randomColor rng  ;   imshow "Result", output ; }  The drawContours function allows the following parameters:  Image: This is the output image used to draw the contours.        Contours: This is the vector of contours.    Contour index: This is a number that indicates the contour to be drawn; if it   is negative, all the contours are drawn.     Color: This is the color used to draw the contour.    Thickness: If this is negative, then the contour is filled with the color chosen.    Line type: This is used when we want draw with antialiasing, or other   drawing methods.     Hierarchy: This is an optional parameter and is only needed if you want to   draw only some of the contours.     Max level: This is an optional parameter and taken into account only when   the hierarchy parameter is available. If it is set to 0, only the specified contour  is drawn, and if it is set to 1, the function draws the current contour and  the nested as well. If it is set to 2, then the algorithm draws all the specified  contour hierarchies.     Offset: This is an optional parameter used to shift the contours.  The result of our example can be shown in the following image:  [ 122 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   After a binarized image, we can see the three different algorithms that are used to  divide and separate each object of an image, allowing us to isolate each object in  order to manipulate or extract features.  We can see the entire process in the following image:  Chapter 5  Summary In this chapter, we explored the basics of object segmentation in a controlled  situation, where a camera take pictures of different objects.  We learned how to remove the background and light in order to allow us to binarize  our image by minimizing the noise and also three different algorithms used to  divide and separate each object of an image, allowing us to isolate each object in  order to manipulate or extract features. Finally, we extracted all the objects on an  image, where we are going to extract characteristics of each of these objects to train a  machine learning system.  In the next chapter, we are going to predict the class of any of objects in an image,  and then call to a robot or any other system to pick any of them, or detect an object  that is not in the correct carrier tape, and then notify to a person to pick it up.  [ 123 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Learning Object Classiication  In the previous chapter, we introduced you to the basic concepts of object  segmentation and detection. This means isolating the objects that appear in   an image for future processing and analysis.  This chapter covers how to classify each of these isolated objects. In order to allow   us to classify each object, we need to train our system to be capable of learning   the required parameters to decide which speciic label should be assigned to the  detected object  depending on the different categories taken into account during the  training phase .  This chapter is going to introduce you to the basic concepts of machine learning to  classify images with different labels.  We will create a basic application based on the segmentation algorithm, as discussed  in Chapter 5, Automated Optical Inspection, Object Segmentation, and Detection. This  segmentation algorithm extracts parts of an image, which contains objects. For each  object, we will extract the different features and analyze them using a machine  learning algorithm. Using a machine learning algorithm, we are able to show,   using our user interface, the labels of each object detected in the input image   to the end user.  In this chapter, we will cover the different topics and algorithms, which are   as follows:     An introduction to machine learning concepts    Common machine learning algorithms and processes    Feature extraction    Support vector machines    Training and prediction  [ 125 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning Object Classiication  Introducing machine learning concepts Machine learning is an old concept that was deined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel as a  ield of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.  Tom. M. Mitchel provided a more formal deinition. In this deinition, Tom links the  concept of samples or experiences, labels, and performance measurements.  The machine learning deinition by Arthur Samuel is  referenced from Some Studies in Machine Learning Using the  Game of Checkers in the IBM Journal of Research and Development   Volume: 3, Issue: 3 , p. 210 and a phrase in The New Yorker  and Ofice Management the same year. The more formal deinition by Tom. M. Mitchel is referenced  from Machine Learning Book, McGray Hill 1997  http:  www. cs.cmu.edu afs cs.cmu.edu user mitchell ftp  mlbook.html .  Machine learning involves pattern recognition and the learning theory in artiicial  intelligence and is related to computational statistics.  Machine learning is used in hundreds of applications such as OCR  Optical  Character Recognition , spam iltering, search engines, and thousands of Computer  Vision applications that we will develop in the current chapter, where a machine  learning algorithm tries to classify the objects that appear in the input image.  Depending on how machine ML algorithms learn from the data or samples, we can  divide them into three categories, which are as follows:     Supervised learning: The computer learns from a set of labeled data. The   goal is to learn the parameters of the model and rules that allow computers  to map the relation between data and output label results.     Unsupervised learning: No labels are given, and the computer tries to   discover the input structure of the input data.     Reinforcement learning: The computer interacts with a dynamic  environment that performs its goal and learns from its mistakes.  [ 126 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 6  Depending on the desired results that we obtain from our machine learning  algorithm, we can categorize them into the following:     Classification: In classification, the space of the inputs can be divided into N  classes, and the prediction results of a given sample are one of these training  classes. This is one of the most used categories. A typical example is an e-mail  spam filtering where there are only two classes: spam and non spam or OCR,  where only N characters are available, and each character is one class.     Regression: The output is a continuous value instead of a discrete value such   as a classification result. One example of regression can be the prediction of  the house price by providing the house size, number of years, and location.     Clustering: The inputs are divided into N groups using unsupervised   training.     Density estimation: This finds the  probability  distribution of inputs.  In our example, we will use a supervised learning classiication algorithm, where a  training dataset  with labels  is used to train the model, and the result of our model is  a prediction of one label.  Machine learning is a modern approach to artiicial intelligence and statistics and  involves both the techniques.  In machine learning, there are several approaches and methods, and some of them  used are SVM  support vector machines , ANNs  artiicial neural networks ,  clustering such as K-Nearest Neighbors, decision trees, or deep learning, which is a  big neural network approach used in some cases that are convolutional, and so on.  All these methods and approaches are supported, implemented, and   well-documented in OpenCV. We are going to explain one of them, SVM,   in the next section.  OpenCV implements eight of these machine learning algorithms. They all inherit  from the StatModel class:     Artificial neural networks    Boost    Random trees    Expectation maximization    K-Nearest Neighbours    Logistic regression    The Normal Bayes Classifier    Support vector machines  [ 127 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning Object Classiication  To get more details of each algorithm, read the OpenCV document page  of machine learning at http:  docs.opencv.org trunk dc dd6  ml_intro.html.  In the following image, you can see the machine learning class hierarchy:  The StatModel class provides all the read and write functions that are very  important to save our machine learning parameters and training data.  In machine learning, the most time-consuming part is the training method.  Training can take from seconds to weeks or months for large datasets and complex  machine learning structures; for example, in deep learning and a big neural network  structure with more than 100,000 images. In deep learning algorithms, it is common  to use parallel hardware processing; for example, GPUs or graphic cards with the  CUDA technology used to decrease the computing time during training.  This means that we cannot train our algorithm each time we run our application,  and it's recommended that we save our model after it is trained because all training  prediction parameters of machine learning are saved. Next, when we want to run  it in the future, we only need to load read from our saved model without training  anymore if we need to update our model with more data.  The StatModel is an interface that is implemented by each of its implementations.  The two key functions are train and predict.  The train method is responsible for learning the parameters of the model from a  training dataset. The train function has the following four calls that can be called in  four different ways:  bool train const Ptr & trainData, int flags=0  ; bool train InputArray samples, int layout, InputArray responses ; Ptr  train const Ptr & data, const _Tp::Params& p, int  flags=0  ; Ptr  train InputArray samples, int layout, InputArray responses,  const _Tp::Params& p, int flags=0  ;  [ 128 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 6  It has the following parameters:     trainData: This is the training data that can be loaded or created from the   TrainData class. This class is new in OpenCV 3 and helps developers to  create training data because different algorithms require different types of  structure of arrays for training and prediction, such as the ANN algorithm.    samples: This is the array of training array samples such as training data in   the format required by the machine learning algorithm.     layout: There are two types of layouts: ROW_SAMPLE  training samples are the   matrix rows  and COL_SAMPLE  training samples are the matrix columns .     responses: This is the vector of responses that is associated with the    sample data.     p: This is the StatModel parameter.    flags: These are optional flags defined by each method.  The predict method is simpler and has only one call:  float StatModel::predict InputArray samples, OutputArray  results=noArray  , int flags=0    It has the following parameters:     samples: These are the input samples to be predicted. There can be only one   or multiple data to be predicted.     results: This is the result of each input row samples  computed by the   algorithm from the previously trained model .     flags: These are optional flags that are model-dependent. Some models,   such as Boost and SVM recognize the StatModel::RAW_OUTPUT flag, which  makes the method return the raw results  the sum  and not the class label.  The StatModel class provides other very useful methods, which are as follows:     isTrained  : This returns true if the model is trained    isClassifier  : This returns true if the model is a classifier or false in the   case of regression     getVarCount  : This returns the number of variables in training samples    save const string& filename : This saves the model in the filename    Ptr  load const string& filename : This loads the model from the  filename, for example: Ptr  svm = StatModel::load  "my_svm_ model.xml" ;  [ 129 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning Object Classiication     calcError const Ptr & data, bool test, OutputArray   resp : This calculates the error from a test data, where the data is the  training data. If the test is true, the method calculates the error from the  test subset of all the training data, otherwise it's computed over the training  subset of the data. Finally resp is the optional output results.  Now, we will learn how to construct a basic application that uses machine learning  in Computer Vision apps.  Computer Vision and the machine  learning worklow  The Computer Vision applications with machine learning have a common basic  structure. This structure is divided into different steps that are repeated in almost  all Computer Vision applications, and some others are omitted. In the following  diagram, we show you the different steps involved:  [ 130 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 6  Almost any Computer Vision application starts with a preprocessing stage that is  applied to the input image. Preprocessing involves light removal conditions and  noise, thresholding, blur, and so on.  After we apply all the preprocessing steps required to the input image, the second  step is segmentation. In the segmentation step, we need to extract the regions of  interest of an image and isolate each one as a unique object of interest. For example,  in a face detection system, we need to separate the faces from the rest of the parts in  the scene.  After getting the objects inside the image, we continue with the next step. We  need to extract all the features of each one detected object; a feature is a vector of  characteristics of objects. A characteristic describes our objects and can be the area of  the object, contour, texture pattern, and so on.  Now, we have the descriptor of our object; a descriptor is a feature that describes an  object, and we use these descriptors to train our model or predict one of them. To  do this, we need to create a big dataset of features, where hundreds, thousands, and  millions of images are preprocessed, and extracted features use all these features in a  train model function that we choose:  [ 131 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning Object Classiication  When we train a dataset, the model learns all the parameters required to predict  when a new vector of features with an unknown label is given:  After we get the prediction, sometimes, a post-processing of output data is required;  for example, merging multiple classiications to decrease the prediction error or  merging multiple labels. A sample case is OCR  Optical Character Recognition ,  where the classiication result is per character, and by combining the results of  character recognitions, we construct a word. This means that we can create a post- processing method to correct errors in detected words.  With this small introduction to machine learning for Computer Vision, we will learn  how to implement our own application that uses machine learning to classify objects  in a slide tape. We will use support vector machines as our classiication methods,  and see how to use them. The other machine learning algorithms have very similar  uses. The OpenCV documentation has a detailed information about all machine  learning algorithms.  [ 132 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 6  Automatic object inspection  classiication example  Continuing with the example of the previous chapter, the automatic object inspection  segmentation, where a carrier tape contains three different types of objects  nuts,  screws, and rings , and with Computer Vision, we will be able to recognize each one  of them to send notiications to a robot or similar to put each one in different boxes.  In Chapter 5, Automated Optical Inspection, Object Segmentation, and Detection, we  preprocessed the input images and extracted the regions of interest of images  and isolated each object using different techniques. Now, we will apply all these  concepts, as explained in previous sections, in this example to extract features and  classify each object and allow to possible robot to put each one in different boxes. In  our application, we are only going to show the labels of each image in an image, but  we can send the positions in the image and the labels to other devices as a robot.  [ 133 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning Object Classiication  Then, our goal is from an input image with few objects to show the objects' names  over each one, as per the following image. However, to learn all the steps of the  complete process, we will train our system to show each image that is trained, create  a plot to show each object the features that we are going to use with different colors,  the preprocessed input image, and inally, the output classiication result with the  following result:  We will perform the following steps for our example application:  1.  For training each image:         Preprocess an image  Segment an image  2.  For each object in an image:  Extract the features        Add the object to the training feature vector with its label  3.  Create an SVM model.  4.  Train our SVM model with the training feature vector. 5.  Preprocess an input image to be classiied.  [ 134 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 6  6.  Segment an input image.  7.  For each object detected:            Extract the features  Predict with an SVM model  Paint the result in an output image  For the preprocessing and segmentation stage, we will use the code discussed in  Chapter 5, Automated Optical Inspection, Object Segmentation, and Detection, and we  will explain how to extract the features and create the vectors required to train and  predict our model.  Feature extraction Now, let's extract the features of each object. To understand the feature concept  of a feature vector, we will extract very simple features, but it is enough to get  good results. In other solutions, we can get more complex features, such as texture  descriptors, contour descriptors, and so on.  In our example, we only have these three types of objects, nuts, rings, and screws, in  different possible positions. All these possible objects and positions are shown in the  following igure:  [ 135 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning Object Classiication  We will explore the good characteristics that will help the computer to identify each  object. The characteristics are as follows:     The area of an object    The aspect ratio, which is the width divided by the height of the    bounding rectangle    The number of holes    The number of contour sides  These characteristics can describe our objects very well, and if we use all of them,  the classiication error can be very small. However, in our implemented example,  we will use only the irst two characteristics, the area and aspect ratio, for learning  purposes because we can plot these characteristics in 2D graphics, and we can show  that these values describe our objects correctly. We can differentiate one kind of  object from the others visually in the graphic plot.  To extract these features, we will use the black white input ROI image as the input,  where only one object appears in a white color with a black background. This input  is the result of segmentation, as discussed in Chapter 5, Automated Optical Inspection,  Object Segmentation, and Detection. We will use the findCountours algorithm for  segmentation objects and create the ExtractFeatures function for this purpose:  vector  > ExtractFeatures Mat img, vector *  left=nULL, vector * top=nULL  {   vector  > output;   vector  > contours;   Mat input= img.clone  ;      vector  hierarchy;   findContours input, contours, hierarchy, RETR_CCOMP, CHAIn_APPROX_ SIMPLE ;      Check the number of objects detected   if contours.size   == 0  {     return output;   }   Rng rng  0xFFFFFFFF  ;   for int i=0; i<contours.size  ; i++ {          Mat mask= Mat::zeros img.rows, img.cols, CV_8UC1 ;     drawContours mask, contours, i, Scalar 1 , FILLED, LInE_8,         hierarchy, 1 ;  [ 136 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 6      Scalar area_s= sum mask ;     float area= area_s[0];      if area>500 {   if the area is greather than min.              RotatedRect r= minAreaRect contours[i] ;       float width= r.size.width;       float height= r.size.height;       float ar= width<height ?height width:width height;        vector  row;       row.push_back area ;       row.push_back ar ;       output.push_back row ;       if left!=nULL {           left->push_back  int r.center.x ;       }       if top!=nULL {           top->push_back  int r.center.y ;       }              miw->addImage "Extract Features", mask*255 ;       miw->render  ;       waitKey 10 ;     }   }   return output; }  Let's understand the code in detail.  We will create a function that has one image as the input and returns two vectors  of left and top position for each object detected in the image as parameters; this will  be used to draw its label over each object. The output of the function is a vector of  vectors of loats; in other words, a matrix where each row contains the features of  each object that is detected.  [ 137 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning Object Classiication  Let's create a function that draws a label over each other:  1.  Firstly, we need to create the output vector variable and contours variable  that are to be used in our FindContours algorithm segmentation, and we  need to create a copy of our input image because the findContours OpenCV  functions modify the input image:   vector  > output;   vector  > contours;   Mat input= img.clone  ;   vector  hierarchy;   findContours input, contours, hierarchy, RETR_CCOMP,       CHAIn_APPROX_SIMPLE ;  2.  Now, we can use the findContours function to retrieve each object in an  image. If we don't detect any contour, we return an empty output matrix: if contours.size   == 0  {     return output;   }  3.  For each object contour we are going to draw in a black image each object  using 1 as the color value. This is our mask image to compute all features: for int i=0; i<contours.size  ; i++ { Mat mask= Mat::zeros img.rows, img.cols, CV_8UC1 ;     drawContours mask, contours, i, Scalar 1 , FILLED, LInE_8,  hierarchy, 1 ;  4.   It's important to use the value 1 to draw inside the shape because we can  calculate the area by summing all values inside the contour:     Scalar area_s= sum mask ;     float area= area_s[0];  5.  This area is our irst feature. Now, we will use this area value as a ilter to   remove the small objects that we need to avoid. All objects with an area  less than a minimum area are discarded. After we pass the ilter, we create  the second feature, that is, the aspect ratio of an object. This means that the  maximum width or height is divided by the minimum width or height. This  feature can differentiate the screw from other objects easily: if area>MIn_AREA {   if the area is greather than min.       RotatedRect r= minAreaRect contours[i] ;       float width= r.size.width;       float height= r.size.height;       float ar= width<height ?height width:width height;  [ 138 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 6  6.  Now, we have the features, and we only need to add these features to the   output vector. To do this, we create a row vector of loats and add these  values, and later on, add this row to the output vector: vector  row;       row.push_back area ;       row.push_back ar ;       output.push_back row ;  7.   If the left and top params are passed, then add the top-left values to the  params output:   if left!=nULL {           left->push_back  int r.center.x ;       }       if top!=nULL {           top->push_back  int r.center.y ;       }  8.  Finally, we will show the detected objects in a window for the user feedback,  and when we inish processing all the objects in the image, we will return the  output feature vector:        miw->addImage "Extract Features", mask*255 ;       miw->render  ;       waitKey 10 ;     }   }   return output;  Now, we can extract the features of each input image, and we need to continue with  the next step, which is to train our model.  Training an SVM model We will use a supervised learning model, and then, we will require images of each  object and their corresponding labels. There are no minimum number of images in  the dataset. If we provide more images for the training process, we will get a better  classiication model  in most of the cases , but simple classiiers can be enough to  train simple models. To do this, we create three folders  screw, nut, and ring ,  where all the images of each type are placed together.  For each image in the folder, we need to extract the features and add them to the  train feature matrix, and at same time, we need to create a new vector with the labels  for each row, corresponding to each training matrix.  [ 139 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning Object Classiication  To evaluate our system, we split each folder into a number of images for testing and  training purposes. We leave around 20 images for testing and the others for training.  Then, we need to create two vectors of labels and two matrices for train and test.  Then, let's understand the code. First, we need to create our model. We need to  declare the model in order to be able access it as a global variable. OpenCV uses   the Ptr template class for pointers:  Ptr  svm;  After we declare the pointer to the new SVM model, we need to create it and train it.  We create the trainAndTest function for this purpose:  void trainAndTest   {   vector  trainingData;   vector  responsesData;   vector  testData;   vector  testResponsesData;    int num_for_test= 20;       get the nut images   readFolderAndExtractFeatures ".. data nut tuerca_%04d.pgm", 0,       num_for_test, trainingData, responsesData, testData,         testResponsesData ;      get and process the ring images   readFolderAndExtractFeatures ".. data ring arandela_%04d.pgm",       1, num_for_test, trainingData, responsesData, testData,         testResponsesData ;      get and process the screw images   readFolderAndExtractFeatures ".. data screw tornillo_%04d.pgm",       2, num_for_test, trainingData, responsesData, testData,         testResponsesData ;      cout << "num of train samples: " << responsesData.size   <<       endl;    cout << "num of test samples: " << testResponsesData.size   <<       endl;         Merge all data    Mat trainingDataMat trainingData.size   2, 2, CV_32FC1,       &trainingData[0] ;  [ 140 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 6    Mat responses responsesData.size  , 1, CV_32SC1,       &responsesData[0] ;    Mat testDataMat testData.size   2, 2, CV_32FC1, &testData[0] ;   Mat testResponses testResponsesData.size  , 1, CV_32FC1,       &testResponsesData[0] ;        svm = SVM::create  ;         svm->setType SVM::C_SVC ;         svm->setKernel SVM::CHI2 ;         svm->setTermCriteria TermCriteria TermCriteria::MAX_ITER,             100, 1e-6  ;    svm->train trainingDataMat, ROW_SAMPLE, responses ;    if testResponsesData.size  >0 {     cout << "Evaluation" << endl;     cout << "==========" << endl;        Test the ML Model     Mat testPredict;     svm->predict testDataMat, testPredict ;     cout << "Prediction Done" << endl;        Error calculation     Mat errorMat= testPredict!=testResponses;     float error= 100.0f * countnonZero errorMat           testResponsesData.size  ;     cout << "Error: " << error << "\%" << endl;        Plot training data with error label     plotTrainData trainingDataMat, responses, &error ;    }else{     plotTrainData trainingDataMat, responses ;   } }  Let's understand the code in detail.  First, we need to create the required variables to store the training and test data:    vector  trainingData;   vector  responsesData;   vector  testData;   vector  testResponsesData;  [ 141 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning Object Classiication  As mentioned earlier, we need to read all the images from each folder, extract the  features, and save them in our training and test data. To do this, we will use the  readFolderAndExtractFeatures function:    int num_for_test= 20;      get the nut images   readFolderAndExtractFeatures ".. data nut tuerca_%04d.pgm", 0,       num_for_test, trainingData, responsesData, testData,         testResponsesData ;      get and process the ring images   readFolderAndExtractFeatures ".. data ring arandela_%04d.pgm",       1, num_for_test, trainingData, responsesData, testData,         testResponsesData ;      get and process the screw images   readFolderAndExtractFeatures ".. data screw tornillo_%04d.pgm",       2, num_for_test, trainingData, responsesData, testData,         testResponsesData ;  The readFolderAndExtractFeatures function uses the VideoCapture OpenCV  function to read all the images of a folder like a video or camera. For each image  read, we extract the features and then add them to the corresponding output vector:  bool readFolderAndExtractFeatures string folder, int label, int num_ for_test,    vector  &trainingData, vector  &responsesData,    vector  &testData, vector  &testResponsesData  {   VideoCapture images;   if images.open folder ==false {     cout << "Can not open the folder images" << endl;     return false;   }   Mat frame;   int img_index=0;   while  images.read frame   {          Preprocess image     Mat pre= preprocessImage frame ;        Extract features     vector  > features= ExtractFeatures pre ;     for int i=0; i< features.size  ; i++ {       if img_index >= num_for_test {         trainingData.push_back features[i][0] ;         trainingData.push_back features[i][1] ;         responsesData.push_back label ;  [ 142 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 6        }else{         testData.push_back features[i][0] ;         testData.push_back features[i][1] ;         testResponsesData.push_back  float label ;       }     }     img_index++;   }   return true; }  After illing all the vectors with features and labels, we need to convert them to the  OpenCV mat format in order to send them to the training function:     Merge all data    Mat trainingDataMat trainingData.size   2, 2, CV_32FC1,       &trainingData[0] ;   Mat responses responsesData.size  , 1, CV_32SC1,       &responsesData[0] ;   Mat testDataMat testData.size   2, 2, CV_32FC1, &testData[0] ;   Mat testResponses testResponsesData.size  , 1, CV_32FC1,       &testResponsesData[0] ;  We are now ready to create and train our machine learning model, as mentioned  earlier, and we are going to use a support vector machine. First, we need to set up  the basic model parameters:     Set up SVM's parameters   svm = SVM::create  ; svm->setType SVM::C_SVC ; svm->setKernel SVM::CHI2 ; svm->setTermCriteria TermCriteria TermCriteria::MAX_ITER, 100, 1e-6  ;  We need to deine the SVM type and kernel to be used and the criteria to stop  the learning process; in our case, we will use a maximum number of iterations,  stopping at 100 iterations. For more information on each parameter and what it  does, check out the OpenCV documentation. After we create the parameters of  the setup, we need to create the model by calling the train method and using the  trainingDataMat and response matrices:       Train the SVM   svm->train trainingDataMat, ROW_SAMPLE, responses ;  [ 143 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning Object Classiication  We use the test vector  by setting the num_for_test variable greater than 0  to  obtain an approximation error of our model. To get the error estimation, we need  to predict all the test vector features to obtain the SVM prediction results and then  compare these results to the original labels:  if testResponsesData.size  >0 {     cout << "Evaluation" << endl;     cout << "==========" << endl;        Test the ML Model     Mat testPredict;     svm->predict testDataMat, testPredict ;     cout << "Prediction Done" << endl;        Error calculation     Mat errorMat= testPredict!=testResponses;     float error= 100.0f * countnonZero errorMat            testResponsesData.size  ;     cout << "Error: " << error << "\%" << endl;        Plot training data with error label     plotTrainData trainingDataMat, responses, &error ;   }else{     plotTrainData trainingDataMat, responses ;   }  We use the predict function using the testDataMat features and a new mat to  predict results. The predict function allows you to do multiple predictions at the  same time, giving a matrix instead of only one row.  After the prediction is done, we only need to get the difference of testPredict  using our testResponses  the original labels . If there are differences, we only need  to count the number of differences and divide them by the total number of tests to  get the error.  We can use the new TrainData class to generate the feature vectors  and samples and split out train data in test and train vectors.  [ 144 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Finally, we need to show the training data in a 2D plot, where the y axis is the aspect  ratio feature and the x axis is the area of objects. Each point has a different color and  shape  cross, square, and circle  that shows a different kind of object, and we can  clearly see the groups of objects in the following igure:  Chapter 6  Now, we are very close to inishing our application sample. We have a trained SVM  model that we can use as a classiication model to detect the type of a new incoming  and unknown feature vector. Then, the next step is to predict an input image with  unknown objects.  [ 145 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning Object Classiication  Input image prediction Now, we are ready to explain the main function, which loads the input image and  predicts the objects that appear inside. We are going to use something like this,  as shown in the following igure, as the input image where multiple and different  objects appear:  For all training images, we need to load and preprocess the input image:  1.  First, we load and convert the images to gray color values.  2.  We then apply the preprocessing tasks, as discussed in Chapter 5,   Automated Optical Inspection, Object Segmentation, and Detection, using the  preprocessImage function: Mat pre= preprocessImage img ;  3.  Now, we extract the features of vectors of all the objects that appear in the   image and the top-left positions of each one using the ExtractFeatures that  we mentioned earlier:    Extract features   vector  pos_top, pos_left;   vector  > features= ExtractFeatures pre, &pos_ left, &pos_top ;  4.  For each object that we detect, we store it as a feature row, and then,    we convert each row as a Mat of one row and two features: for int i=0; i< features.size  ; i++ {     Mat trainingDataMat 1, 2, CV_32FC1, &features[i][0] ;  [ 146 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 6  5.  Then, we predict the single object using the predict function of our   StatModel SVM: float result= svm->predict trainingDataMat ;  The float result of the prediction is the label of the object that is detected.  Then, to complete the application, we only need to draw the label over each  image in an output image.  6.  We will use a stringstream to store the text and a Scalar to store the color   of each different label: stringstream ss;     Scalar color;     if result==0 {       color= green;    nUT       ss << "nUT";     }     else if result==1 {       color= blue;    RIng       ss << "RIng" ;     }     else if result==2 {       color= red;    SCREW       ss << "SCREW";     }  7.  Draw the label text over each object using its detected position in the   ExtractFeatures function: putText img_output,        ss.str  ,        Point2d pos_left[i], pos_top[i] ,        FOnT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX,        0.4,        color ;  8.  Finally, we will draw our results in the output window:    miw->addImage "Binary image", pre ;   miw->addImage "Result", img_output ;   miw->render  ;   waitKey 0 ;  [ 147 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning Object Classiication  The inal result of our application shows a window that is tiled with four screens,  where the top-left image is the input training image, the top-right image is the plot  training image, the bottom-left image is the input image to analyze preprocessed,  and the bottom-right image is the inal result of the prediction:  Summary In this chapter, we learned the basics of the machine learning model and how to  apply a small sample application to understand all the basic tips required to create  our own ML application.  Machine learning is complex and involves different techniques for each use case   supervised learning, unsupervised, clustering, and so on , and we learned how to  create the most typical ML application and the supervised learning with an SVM.  The most important concepts in supervised machine learning are: irst, we need to  have an appropriate number of samples or datasets; and second, we need to correctly  choose the features that describe our objects correctly. For more information on image  features, refer to Chapter 8, Video Surveillance, Background Modeling, and Morphological  Operations. Third, choose the best model that gives us the best predictions.  If we don't reach the correct predictions we have to check each one of these concepts  to look for where the issue is.  In the next chapter, we will introduce background subtraction methods, which are  very useful for video surveillance applications where the backgrounds don't give us  any interesting information and must be discarded to allow the segmentation of the  interested objects in which to analyze.  [ 148 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Detecting Face Parts and  Overlaying Masks  In the previous chapter, we learned about object classiication and how machine  learning can be used to achieve it. In this chapter, we will learn how to detect and  track different face parts. We will start the discussion by understanding the face  detection pipeline and how it's built from the ground up. We will then use this  framework to detect face parts, such as eyes, ears, mouth, and nose. We will then  learn how to overlay funny masks on these face parts in a live video.  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:  Integral images and why we need them     Working with Haar cascades       Building a generic face detection pipeline    Detecting and tracking face parts, such as eyes, ears, nose, and mouth in a   live video stream from the webcam     Automatically overlaying facemasks, sunglasses, and a funny nose on a   person's face in a video  [ 149 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Detecting Face Parts and Overlaying Masks  Understanding Haar cascades Haar cascades are cascade classiiers that are based on Haar features. What is a  cascade classiier? It is simply a concatenation of a set of weak classiiers that can  be used to create a strong classiier. Now, what do we mean by weak and strong  classiiers? Weak classiiers are classiiers whose performances are limited. They  don't have the ability to classify everything correctly. If you keep the problem really  simple, they might perform at an acceptable level. Strong classiiers, on the other  hand, are really good at classifying our data correctly. We will see how it all comes  together in the next couple of paragraphs. Another important part of Haar cascades  is Haar features. These features are simple summations of rectangles and differences  of those areas across the image. Let's consider the following igure:  If we want to compute the Haar features of the region ABCD, we just need to  compute the difference between the white pixels and the colored pixels in that  region. As shown in in the preceding four igures, we use different patterns to build  Haar features. There are a lot of other patterns that are used as well. We do this at  multiple scales to make the system scale invariant. When we say multiple scales, we  just scale the image down to compute the same features again. This way, we can  make it robust against size variations of a given object.  [ 150 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7  As it turns out, this concatenation system is a very good method to detect  objects in an image. In 2001, Paul Viola and Michael Jones published a  seminal paper where they described a fast and effective method for object  detection. If you are curious to learn more about it, you can check out  their paper at http:  www.cs.ubc.ca ~lowe 425 slides 13- Violajones.pdf.  Let's dive deeper into it to understand what they actually did. They basically  described an algorithm that uses a boosted cascade of simple classiiers. This system  is used to build a strong classiier that can perform really well. Why did they use  these simple classiiers instead of complex classiiers that can be more accurate? Well,  using this technique, they were able to avoid the problem of having to build a single  classiier that can perform with high precision. These single-step classiiers tend to  be complex and computationally intensive. The reason why their technique works  so well is because the simple classiiers can be weak learners, which means that they  don't need to be complex.  Consider the problem of building a table detector. We want to build a system that  will automatically learn what a table looks like. Based on this knowledge, it should  be able to identify whether there is a table in any given image. To build this system,  the irst step is to collect images that can be used to train our system. There are a  lot of techniques available in the machine learning world that can be used to train  a system like this. Keep in mind that we need to collect a lot of table and non-table  images if we want our system to perform well. In machine learning lingo, table  images are called positive samples and the non-table images are called negative  samples. Our system will ingest this data and then learn to differentiate between  these two classes.  In order to build a real-time system, we need to keep our classiier nice and simple.  The only concern is that simple classiiers are not very accurate. If we try to make  them more accurate, then they will end up being computationally intensive and  hence slow. This kind of trade-off between accuracy and speed is very common in  machine learning. So, we will overcome this problem by concatenating a bunch of  weak classiiers to create a strong and uniied classiier. We don't need the weak  classiiers to be very accurate. To ensure the quality of the overall classiier, Viola and  Jones have described a nifty technique in the cascading step. You can go through the  paper to understand the complete system.  [ 151 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Detecting Face Parts and Overlaying Masks  Now that we understand the general pipeline, let's see how to build a system that  can detect faces in a live video. The irst step is to extract features from all the images.  In this case, the algorithms need these features to learn and understand what faces  look like. They used Haar features in their paper to build the feature vectors. Once  we extract these features, we pass them through a cascade of classiiers. We just  check all the different rectangular subregions and keep discarding the ones that don't  have faces in them. This way, we arrive at the inal answer quickly to see whether a  given rectangle contains a face or not.  What are integral images? In order to extract these Haar features, we need to calculate the sum of the pixel  values enclosed in many rectangular regions of the image. To make it scale invariant,  we need to compute these areas at multiple scales  that is, for various rectangle  sizes . If implemented naively, this would be a very computationally intensive  process. We would have to iterate over all the pixels of each rectangle, including  reading the same pixels multiple times if they are contained in different overlapping  rectangles. If you want to build a system that can run in real time, you cannot spend  so much time in computation. We need to ind a way to avoid this huge redundancy  during the area computation because we iterate over the same pixels multiple times.  To avoid this, we can use something called integral images. These images can be  initialized in a linear time  by iterating only twice over the image  and can then be  provided with the sum of pixels inside any rectangle of any size by reading only four  values. To understand it better, let's take a look at the following igure:  [ 152 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   If we want to calculate the area of any rectangle in our image, we don't have to  iterate through all the pixels in that region. Let's consider a rectangle formed by the  top-left point in the image and any point P as the opposite corner. Let AP denote the  area of this rectangle. For example, in the preceding igure, AB denotes the area of the  5 X 2 rectangle formed by taking the top-left point and B as opposite corners. Let's  take a look at the following igure for clarity purposes:  Chapter 7  Let's take a look at the top-left diagram in the preceding igure. The colored pixels  indicate the area between the top-left pixel and point A. This is denoted by AA. The  remaining diagrams are denoted by their respective names: AB, AC, and AD. Now,  if we want to calculate the area of the rectangle ABCD, as shown in the preceding  igure, we will use the following formula:  Area of the rectangle ABCD = AC –  AB + AD - AA   [ 153 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Detecting Face Parts and Overlaying Masks  What's so special about this particular formula? As we know, extracting Haar  features from the image includes computing these summations, and we would  have to do it for a lot of rectangles at multiple scales in the image. A lot of these  calculations are repetitive because we would be iterating over the same pixels over  and over again. It is so slow that building a real-time system wouldn't be feasible.  Hence, we need this formula. As you can see, we don't have to iterate over the same  pixels multiple times. If we want to compute the area of any rectangle, all the values  on the right-hand side of the previous equation are readily available in our integral  image. We just use pick up the right values, substitute them in the previous equation,  and extract the features.  Overlaying a facemask in a live video OpenCV provides a nice face detection framework. We just need to load the cascade  ile and use it to detect the faces in an image. When we capture a video stream from  the webcam, we can overlay funny masks on top of our faces. It will look something  like this:  [ 154 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Let's take a look at the main parts of the code to see how to overlay the preceding  mask on top of the face in the input video stream. The complete code is available in  the downloadable code bundle provided along with this book:  Chapter 7  int main int argc, char* argv[]  {     string faceCascadename = argv[1];             Variable declarations and initializations             Iterate until the user presses the Esc key     while true      {            Capture the current frame         cap >> frame;                     Resize the frame         resize frame, frame, Size  , scalingFactor, scalingFactor,             InTER_AREA ;                     Convert to grayscale         cvtColor frame, framegray, CV_BgR2gRAY ;                     Equalize the histogram         equalizeHist framegray, framegray ;                     Detect faces         faceCascade.detectMultiScale framegray, faces, 1.1, 2,             0CV_HAAR_SCALE_IMAgE, Size 30, 30   ;  Let's see what happened here. We start reading input frames from the webcam  and resize it to our size of choice. The captured frame is a color image and face  detection works on grayscale images. So, we convert it to grayscale and equalize the  histogram. Why do we need to equalize the histogram? We need to do this in order  to compensate for any kind of issues, such as lighting, saturation, and so on. If the  image is too bright or too dark, the detection will be poor. So, we need to equalize  the histogram to ensure that our image has a healthy range of pixel values:             Draw green rectangle around the face         for int i = 0; i < faces.size  ; i++          {             Rect faceRect faces[i].x, faces[i].y, faces[i].width,                 faces[i].height ;               [ 155 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Detecting Face Parts and Overlaying Masks                 Custom parameters to make the mask fit your face. You  may have to play around with them to make sure it works.             int x = faces[i].x - int 0.1*faces[i].width ;             int y = faces[i].y - int 0.0*faces[i].height ;             int w = int 1.1 * faces[i].width ;             int h = int 1.3 * faces[i].height ;                             Extract region of interest  ROI  covering your face             frameROI = frame Rect x,y,w,h  ;  At this point, we know where the face is. So, we extract the region of interest to  overlay the mask in the right position:                 Resize the face mask image based on the dimensions of  the above ROI             resize faceMask, faceMaskSmall, Size w,h  ;                             Convert the above image to grayscale             cvtColor faceMaskSmall, grayMaskSmall, CV_BgR2gRAY ;                             Threshold the above image to isolate the pixels  associated only with the face mask             threshold grayMaskSmall, grayMaskSmallThresh, 230, 255,  CV_THRESH_BInARY_InV ;  We isolated the pixels associated with the face mask. Now, we want to overlay  the mask in such a way that it doesn't look like a rectangle. We want the exact  boundaries of the overlaid object so that it looks natural. Let's go ahead and overlay  the mask now:                 Create mask by inverting the above image  because we  don't want the background to affect the overlay              bitwise_not grayMaskSmallThresh, grayMaskSmallThreshInv ;                             Use bitwise "AnD" operator to extract precise boundary  of face mask             bitwise_and faceMaskSmall, faceMaskSmall, maskedFace,  grayMaskSmallThresh ;                             Use bitwise "AnD" operator to overlay face mask             bitwise_and frameROI, frameROI, maskedFrame,  grayMaskSmallThreshInv ;                             Add the above masked images and place it in the  original frame ROI to create the final image             add maskedFace, maskedFrame, frame Rect x,y,w,h   ;  [ 156 ]  www.it-ebooks.info           }              code dealing with memory release and gUi      return 1; }  Chapter 7  What happened in the code? The irst thing to note is that this code takes two input arguments: the face cascade  xml ile and the mask image. You can use the haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml  and facemask.jpg iles that are provided. We need a classiier model that can be  used to detect faces in an image, and OpenCV provides a prebuilt xml ile that can be  used for this purpose. We use the faceCascade.load  function to load the xml ile  and also check whether the ile has been loaded correctly.  We initiate the video capture object to capture the input frames from the webcam.  We then convert it to grayscale to run the detector. The detectMultiScale function  is used to extract the boundaries of all the faces in the input image. We may have  to scale down the image according to our needs, so the second argument in this  function takes care of this. This scaling factor is the jump that we take at each scale.  Since we need to look for faces at multiple scales, the next size will be 1.1 times  bigger than the current size. The last parameter is a threshold that speciies the  number of adjacent rectangles that are needed to keep the current rectangle.   It can be used to increase the robustness of the face detector.  We start the while loop and keep detecting the face in every frame until the user  presses the Esc key. Once we detect a face, we need to overlay a mask on it. We  may have to modify the dimensions slightly to ensure that the mask its nicely. This  customization is slightly subjective and it depends on the mask that's being used.  Now that we have extracted the region of interest, we need to place our mask on top  of this region. If we overlay the mask with its white background, it will look weird.  We need to extract the exact curvy boundaries of the mask and overlay it. We want  the skull-mask pixels to be visible and the remaining area to be transparent.  As we can see, the input mask has a white background. So, we create a mask by  applying a threshold to the mask image. Using trial and error, we can see that a  threshold of 240 works well. In the image, all the pixels with an intensity value  greater than 240 will become 0, and all the others will become 255. As far as the  region of interest is concerned in the image, we need to black out all the pixels in this  region. To do this, we simply use the inverse of the mask that was just created. In the  last step, we just add the masked versions to produce the inal output image.  [ 157 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Detecting Face Parts and Overlaying Masks  Get your sunglasses on Now that we understand how to detect faces, we can generalize this concept to  detect different parts of the face. We will use an eye detector to overlay sunglasses  in a live video. It's important to understand that the Viola-Jones framework can be  applied to any object. The accuracy and robustness will depend on the uniqueness  of the object. For example, a human face has very unique characteristics, so it's easy  to train our system to be robust. On the other hand, an object such as a towel is too  generic, and there are no distinguishing characteristics as such. So, it's more dificult  to build a robust towel detector.  Once you build the eye detector and overlay glasses on top of it, it will look  something like this:  Let's take a look at the main parts of the code:  int main int argc, char* argv[]  {     string faceCascadename = argv[1];     string eyeCascadename = argv[2];         Variable declarations and initializations          Face detection code           [ 158 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 7          vector  centers;                     Draw green circles around the eyes         for int i = 0; i < faces.size  ; i++          {             Mat faceROI = framegray faces[i] ;             vector  eyes;                             In each face, detect eyes             eyeCascade.detectMultiScale faceROI, eyes, 1.1, 2, 0 CV_ HAAR_SCALE_IMAgE, Size 30, 30  ;  As we can see here, we run the eye detector only in the face region. We don't need  to search the entire image for eyes because we know that the eyes will always be on  your face:                 For each eye detected, compute the center             for int j = 0; j < eyes.size  ; j++              {                 Point center  faces[i].x + eyes[j].x + int eyes[j]. width*0.5 , faces[i].y + eyes[j].y + int eyes[j].height*0.5   ;                 centers.push_back center ;             }         }                     Overlay sunglasses only if both eyes are detected         if centers.size   == 2          {             Point leftPoint, rightPoint;                             Identify the left and right eyes             if centers[0].x < centers[1].x              {                 leftPoint = centers[0];                 rightPoint = centers[1];             }             else             {                 leftPoint = centers[1];                 rightPoint = centers[0];             }  [ 159 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Detecting Face Parts and Overlaying Masks  We detect the eyes and store them only when we ind both of them. We then use  their coordinates to determine which one is the left eye and the right eye:                 Custom parameters to make the sunglasses fit your face.  You may have to play around with them to make sure it works.             int w = 2.3 *  rightPoint.x - leftPoint.x ;             int h = int 0.4 * w ;             int x = leftPoint.x - 0.25*w;             int y = leftPoint.y - 0.5*h;                             Extract region of interest  ROI  covering both the eyes             frameROI = frame Rect x,y,w,h  ;                             Resize the sunglasses image based on the dimensions of  the above ROI             resize eyeMask, eyeMaskSmall, Size w,h  ;  In the preceding code, we adjusted the size of the sunglasses to it the scale of our  faces in the webcam:                 Convert the above image to grayscale             cvtColor eyeMaskSmall, grayMaskSmall, CV_BgR2gRAY ;                             Threshold the above image to isolate the foreground  object             threshold grayMaskSmall, grayMaskSmallThresh, 245, 255,  CV_THRESH_BInARY_InV ;                             Create mask by inverting the above image  because we  don't want the background to affect the overlay              bitwise_not grayMaskSmallThresh, grayMaskSmallThreshInv ;                             Use bitwise "AnD" operator to extract precise boundary  of sunglasses             bitwise_and eyeMaskSmall, eyeMaskSmall, maskedEye,  grayMaskSmallThresh ;                             Use bitwise "AnD" operator to overlay sunglasses             bitwise_and frameROI, frameROI, maskedFrame,  grayMaskSmallThreshInv ;               [ 160 ]  www.it-ebooks.info                  Add the above masked images and place it in the  original frame ROI to create the final image             add maskedEye, maskedFrame, frame Rect x,y,w,h   ;         }             code for memory release and gUI  Chapter 7      return 1; }  Looking inside the code If you notice, the low of the code looks similar to the face detection code that we  discussed earlier. We load the face detection cascade classiier as well as the eye  detection cascade classiier. Now why do we need to load the face cascade classiier  when we are detecting the eyes? Well, we don't really need to use the face detector,  but it helps us limit our search for the eyes' location. We know that the eyes are  always located on somebody's face, so we can limit the eye detection to the face  region. The irst step would be to detect the face and then run our eye detector code  on this region. Since we would be operating on a smaller region, it would be faster  and more eficient.  For each frame, we start by detecting the face. We then go ahead and detect the  location of the eyes by operating on this region. After this step, we need to overlay  the sunglasses. To do this, we need to resize the sunglasses' image to make sure that  it its our face. To get the proper scale, we can consider the distance between the two  eyes that are being detected. We overlay the sunglasses only when we detect both  the eyes. That's why we irst run the eye detector, collect all the centers, and then  overlay the sunglasses. Once we have this, we just need to overlay the sunglasses'  mask. The principle used for masking is very similar to the principle that we used  to overlay the facemask. You may have to customize the sizing and position of the  sunglasses depending on what you want. You can play around with different types  of sunglasses to see what they look like.  [ 161 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Detecting Face Parts and Overlaying Masks  Tracking your nose, mouth, and ears  Now that you know how to track different things using the framework, you can try  tracking your nose, mouth, and ears as well. Let's use a nose detector to overlay a  funny nose on top:  You can refer to the code iles for a complete implementation of this detector. There  are cascade iles called haarcascade_mcs_nose.xml, haarcascade_mcs_mouth.xml,  haarcascade_mcs_leftear.xml, and haarcascade_mcs_rightear.xml that can be  used to track the different face parts. So, you can play around with them and try to  overlay a moustache or Dracula ears on yourself!  Summary In this chapter, we discussed Haar cascades and integral images. We learned how  the face detection pipeline is built. We learned how to detect and track faces in a  live video stream. We discussed how to use the face detection framework to detect  various face parts, such as eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. We also learned how to  overlay masks on top on the input image using the results of the face parts detection.  In the next chapter, we will learn about video surveillance, background removal,   and morphological image processing.  [ 162 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Video Surveillance,  Background Modeling, and  Morphological Operations  In this chapter, we will learn how to detect a moving object in a video that is taken  from a static camera. This is used extensively in video surveillance systems. We will  discuss the different characteristics that can be used to build this system. We will  learn about background modeling and see how we can use it to build a model of the  background in a live video. Once we do this, we will combine all the blocks to detect  the objects of interest in the video.  By the end of this chapter, you should be able to answer the following questions:     What is naive background subtraction?    What is frame differencing?    How to build a background model?    How to identify a new object in a static video?    What is morphological image processing and how is it related to    background modeling?     How to achieve different effects using morphological operators?  [ 163 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Video Surveillance, Background Modeling, and Morphological Operations  Understanding background subtraction Background subtraction is very useful in video surveillance. Basically, the  background subtraction technique performs really well in cases where we need  to detect moving objects in a static scene. Now, how is this useful for video  surveillance? The process of video surveillance involves dealing with a constant  data low. The data stream keeps coming in at all times, and we need to analyze it to  identify any suspicious activities. Let's consider the example of a hotel lobby. All the  walls and furniture have a ixed location. Now, if we build a background model, we  can use it to identify suspicious activities in the lobby. We can take advantage of the  fact that the background scene remains static  which happens to be true in this case .  This helps us avoid any unnecessary computation overheads.  As the name suggests, this algorithm works by detecting the background and  assigning each pixel of an image to two classes: either the background  assuming that  it's static and stable  or the foreground. It then subtracts the background from the  current frame to obtain the foreground. By the static assumption, foreground objects  will naturally correspond to objects or people moving in front of the background.  In order to detect moving objects, we irst need to build a model of the background.  This is not the same as direct frame differencing because we are actually modeling  the background and using this model to detect moving objects. When we say that  we are modeling the background, we are basically building a mathematical formulation  that can be used to represent the background. So, this performs in a much better way  than the simple frame differencing technique. This technique tries to detect static  parts of the scene and then updates the background model. This background model  is then used to detect background pixels. So, it's an adaptive technique that can  adjust according to the scene.  Naive background subtraction Let's start the background subtraction discussion from the beginning. What does a  background subtraction process look like? Consider the following image:  [ 164 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8  The preceding image represents the background scene. Now, let's introduce a new  object into this scene:  [ 165 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Video Surveillance, Background Modeling, and Morphological Operations  As shown in the preceding image, there is a new object in the scene. So, if we  compute the difference between this image and our background model, you   should be able to identify the location of the TV remote:  The overall process looks like this:  [ 166 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8  Does it work well? There's a reason why we call it the naive approach. It works under ideal conditions,  and as we know, nothing is ideal in the real world. It does a reasonably good job of  computing the shape of the given object, but it does so under some constraints. One  of the main requirements of this approach is that the color and intensity of the object  should be suficiently different from that of the background. Some of the factors that  affect these kinds of algorithms are image noise, lighting conditions, autofocus in  cameras, and so on.  Once a new object enters our scene and stays there, it will be dificult to detect new  objects that are in front of it. This is because we don't update our background model,  and the new object is now part of our background. Consider the following image:  [ 167 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Video Surveillance, Background Modeling, and Morphological Operations  Now, let's say a new object enters our scene:  We identify this to be a new object, which is ine. Let's say another object comes into  the scene:  [ 168 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   It will be dificult to identify the location of these two different objects because their  locations overlap. Here's what we get after subtracting the background and applying  the threshold:  Chapter 8  In this approach, we assume that the background is static. If some parts of our  background start moving, then those parts will start getting detected as new objects.  So, even if the movements are minor, say a waving lag, it will cause problems in our  detection algorithm. This approach is also sensitive to changes in illumination, and  it cannot handle any camera movement. Needless to say, it's a delicate approach! We  need something that can handle all these things in the real world.  Frame differencing We know that we cannot keep a static background image that can be used to detect  objects. So, one of the ways to ix this would be to use frame differencing. It is one of  the simplest techniques that we can use to see what parts of the video are moving.  When we consider a live video stream, the difference between successive frames  gives a lot of information. The concept is fairly straightforward. We just take the  difference between successive frames and display the difference.  [ 169 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Video Surveillance, Background Modeling, and Morphological Operations  If I move my laptop rapidly, we can see something like this:  Instead of the laptop, let's move the object and see what happens. If I rapidly shake  my head, it will look something like this:  [ 170 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8  As you can see in the preceding images, only the moving parts of the video get  highlighted. This gives us a good starting point to see the areas that are moving in  the video. Let's take a look at the function to compute the frame difference:  Mat frameDiff Mat prevFrame, Mat curFrame, Mat nextFrame  {     Mat diffFrames1, diffFrames2, output;             Compute absolute difference between current frame and the next  frame     absdiff nextFrame, curFrame, diffFrames1 ;             Compute absolute difference between current frame and the  previous frame     absdiff curFrame, prevFrame, diffFrames2 ;             Bitwise "AnD" operation between the above two diff images     bitwise_and diffFrames1, diffFrames2, output ;          return output; }  Frame differencing is fairly straightforward. You compute the absolute difference  between the current frame and previous frame and between the current frame and  next frame. We then take these frame differences and apply a bitwise AND operator.  This will highlight the moving parts in the image. If you just compute the difference  between the current frame and previous frame, it tends to be noisy. Hence, we need  to use the bitwise AND operator between successive frame differences to get some  stability when we see the moving objects.  Let's take a look at the function that can extract and return a frame from the webcam:  Mat getFrame VideoCapture cap, float scalingFactor  {       float scalingFactor = 0.5;     Mat frame, output;         Capture the current frame     cap >> frame;             Resize the frame     resize frame, frame, Size  , scalingFactor, scalingFactor, InTER_ AREA ;       [ 171 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Video Surveillance, Background Modeling, and Morphological Operations         Convert to grayscale     cvtColor frame, output, CV_BgR2gRAY ;          return output; }  As we can see, it's pretty straightforward. We just need to resize the frame and  convert it to grayscale. Now that we have the helper functions ready, let's take   a look at the main function and see how it all comes together:  int main int argc, char* argv[]  {     Mat frame, prevFrame, curFrame, nextFrame;     char ch;          Create the capture object        0 -> input arg that specifies it should take the input from the  webcam     VideoCapture cap 0 ;             If you cannot open the webcam, stop the execution!     if  !cap.isOpened             return -1;            create gUI windows     namedWindow "Frame" ;             Scaling factor to resize the input frames from the webcam     float scalingFactor = 0.75;          prevFrame = getFrame cap, scalingFactor ;     curFrame = getFrame cap, scalingFactor ;     nextFrame = getFrame cap, scalingFactor ;             Iterate until the user presses the Esc key     while true      {            Show the object movement         imshow "Object Movement", frameDiff prevFrame, curFrame,  nextFrame  ;                     Update the variables and grab the next frame         prevFrame = curFrame;         curFrame = nextFrame;         nextFrame = getFrame cap, scalingFactor ;                     get the keyboard input and check if it's 'Esc'  [ 172 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8             27 -> ASCII value of 'Esc' key         ch = waitKey  30  ;         if  ch == 27  {             break;         }     }             Release the video capture object     cap.release  ;             Close all windows     destroyAllWindows  ;          return 1; }  How well does it work? As we can see, frame differencing addresses a couple of important problems that we  faced earlier. It can quickly adapt to lighting changes or camera movements. If an  object comes in the frame and stays there, it will not be detected in the future frames.  One of the main concerns of this approach is about detecting uniformly colored  objects. It can only detect the edges of a uniformly colored object. This is because a  large portion of this object will result in very low pixel differences, as shown in the  following image:  [ 173 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Video Surveillance, Background Modeling, and Morphological Operations  Let's say this object moved slightly. If we compare this with the previous frame,   it will look like this:  Hence, we have very few pixels that are labeled on that object. Another concern   is that it is dificult to detect whether an object is moving toward the camera or   away from it.  The Mixture of Gaussians approach Before we talk about Mixture of Gaussians  MOG , let's see what a mixture model is.  A mixture model is just a statistical model that can be used to represent the presence  of subpopulations within our data. We don't really care about what category each  data point belongs to. All we need to do is identify whether the data has multiple  groups inside it. Now, if we represent each subpopulation using the Gaussian  function, then it's called Mixture of Gaussians. Let's consider the following image:  [ 174 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Now, as we gather more frames in this scene, every part of the image will gradually  become part of the background model. This is what we discussed earlier as well.  If a scene is static, the model adapts itself to make sure that the background model  is updated. The foreground mask, which is supposed to represent the foreground  object, looks like a black image at this point because every pixel is part of the  background model.  Chapter 8  OpenCV has multiple algorithms implemented for the Mixture of  Gaussians approach. One of them is called MOG and the other is called  MOG2. To get a detailed explanation, you can refer to http:  docs. opencv.org master db d5c tutorial_py_bg_subtraction. htmlgsc.tab=0. You will also be able check out the original research  papers that were used to implement these algorithms.  Let's introduce a new object into this scene and see what the foreground mask looks  like using the MOG approach:  [ 175 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Video Surveillance, Background Modeling, and Morphological Operations  Let's wait for some time and introduce a new object into the scene. Let's take a look  at what the new foreground mask looks like using the MOG2 approach:  As you can see in the preceding images, the new objects are being identiied  correctly. Let's take a look at the interesting part of the code  you can get the  complete code in the .cpp iles :  int main int argc, char* argv[]  {        Variable declarations and initializations             Iterate until the user presses the Esc key     while true      {            Capture the current frame         cap >> frame;                     Resize the frame         resize frame, frame, Size  , scalingFactor, scalingFactor,  InTER_AREA ;                     Update the MOg background model based on the current frame         pMOg->operator   frame, fgMaskMOg ;                     Update the MOg2 background model based on the current frame         pMOg2->operator   frame, fgMaskMOg2 ;           [ 176 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8             Show the current frame           imshow "Frame", frame ;                     Show the MOg foreground mask         imshow "Fg Mask MOg", fgMaskMOg ;             Show the MOg2 foreground mask         imshow "Fg Mask MOg 2", fgMaskMOg2 ;                     get the keyboard input and check if it's 'Esc'            27 -> ASCII value of 'Esc' key         ch = waitKey  30  ;         if  ch == 27  {             break;         }     }             Release the video capture object     cap.release  ;             Close all windows     destroyAllWindows  ;          return 1; }  What happened in the code? Let's quickly go through the code and see what's happening there. We use the  Mixture of Gaussians model to create a background subtractor object. This object  represents the model that will be updated as and when we encounter new frames  from the webcam. As we can see in the code, we initialize two background  subtraction models: BackgroundSubtractorMOg and BackgroundSubtractorMOg2.  They represent two different algorithms that are used for background subtraction.  The irst one refers to the paper by P. KadewTraKuPong and R. Bowden titled, An  improved adaptive background mixture model for real-time tracking with shadow detection.  You can check it out at http:  personal.ee.surrey.ac.uk Personal R. Bowden publications avbs01 avbs01.pdf. The second one refers to the  paper by Z.Zivkovic titled, Improved adaptive Gausian Mixture Model for background  subtraction. You can check it out at http:  www.zoranz.net Publications  zivkovic2004ICPR.pdf. We start an ininite while loop and continuously read the  input frames from the webcam. With each frame, we update the background model,  as shown in the following lines:  pMOg->operator   frame, fgMaskMOg ; pMOg2->operator   frame, fgMaskMOg2 ;  [ 177 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Video Surveillance, Background Modeling, and Morphological Operations  The background model gets updated in these steps. Now, if a new object enters   the scene and stays there, it will become part of the background model. This   helps us overcome one of the biggest shortcomings of the naïve background  subtraction model.  Morphological image processing As discussed earlier, background subtraction methods are affected by many factors.  Their accuracy depends on how we capture the data and how it's processed. One of  the biggest factors that tend to affect these algorithms is the noise level. When we  say noise, we are talking about things, such as graininess in an image, isolated black  white pixels, and so on. These issues tend to affect the quality of our algorithms. This  is where morphological image processing comes into picture. Morphological image  processing is used extensively in a lot of real-time systems to ensure the quality of  the output.  Morphological image processing refers to processing the shapes of features in  the image. For example, you can make a shape thicker or thinner. Morphological  operators rely on how the pixels are ordered in an image, but on their values. This  is the reason why they are really well suited to manipulate shapes in binary images.  Morphological image processing can be applied to grayscale images as well, but the  pixel values will not matter much.  What's the underlying principle? Morphological operators use a structuring element to modify an image. What is a  structuring element? A structuring element is basically a small shape that can be  used to inspect a small region in the image. It is positioned at all the pixel locations in  the image so that it can inspect that neighborhood. We basically take a small window  and overlay it on top of a pixel. Depending on the response, we take an appropriate  action at that pixel location.  Let's consider the following input image:  [ 178 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   We will apply a bunch of morphological operations to this image to see how the  shape changes.  Chapter 8  Slimming the shapes We can achieve this effect using an operation called erosion. This is an operation that  makes a shape thinner by peeling the boundary layers of all the shapes in the image:  Let's take a look at the function that performs morphological erosion:  Mat performErosion Mat inputImage, int erosionElement, int  erosionSize  {     Mat outputImage;     int erosionType;          if erosionElement == 0          erosionType = MORPH_RECT;          else if erosionElement == 1          erosionType = MORPH_CROSS;          else if erosionElement == 2          erosionType = MORPH_ELLIPSE;             Create the structuring element for erosion     Mat element = getStructuringElement erosionType,  Size 2*erosionSize + 1, 2*erosionSize + 1 , Point erosionSize,  erosionSize  ;             Erode the image using the structuring element     erode inputImage, outputImage, element ;             Return the output image     return outputImage; }  [ 179 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Video Surveillance, Background Modeling, and Morphological Operations  You can check out the complete code in the .cpp iles to understand how to use  this function. Basically, we build a structuring element using an built-in OpenCV  function. This object is used as a probe to modify each pixel based on certain  conditions. These conditions refer to what's happening around that particular pixel  in the image. For example, is it surrounded by white pixels? Or is it surrounded by  black pixels? Once we have an answer, we can take an appropriate action.  Thickening the shapes We use an operation called dilation to achieve thickening. This is an operation that  makes a shape thicker by adding boundary layers to all the shapes in the image:  Here is the code to do this:  Mat performDilation Mat inputImage, int dilationElement, int  dilationSize  {     Mat outputImage;     int dilationType;          if dilationElement == 0          dilationType = MORPH_RECT;          else if dilationElement == 1          dilationType = MORPH_CROSS;          else if dilationElement == 2          dilationType = MORPH_ELLIPSE;             Create the structuring element for dilation     Mat element = getStructuringElement dilationType,  Size 2*dilationSize + 1, 2*dilationSize + 1 , Point dilationSize,  dilationSize  ;       [ 180 ]  www.it-ebooks.info          Dilate the image using the structuring element     dilate inputImage, outputImage, element ;             Return the output image     return outputImage; }  Chapter 8  Other morphological operators Here are some other morphological operators that are interesting. Let's irst take a  look at the output image. We can take a look at the code at the end of this section.  Morphological opening This is an operation that opens a shape. This operator is frequently used for noise  removal in an image. We can achieve morphological opening by applying erosion  followed by dilation to an image. The morphological opening process basically  removes small objects from the foreground in the image by placing them in   the background:  Here is the function to the perform morphological opening:  Mat performOpening Mat inputImage, int morphologyElement, int  morphologySize  {     Mat outputImage, tempImage;     int morphologyType;          if morphologyElement == 0          morphologyType = MORPH_RECT;          else if morphologyElement == 1          morphologyType = MORPH_CROSS;       [ 181 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Video Surveillance, Background Modeling, and Morphological Operations      else if morphologyElement == 2          morphologyType = MORPH_ELLIPSE;             Create the structuring element for erosion     Mat element = getStructuringElement morphologyTy pe, Size 2*morphologySize + 1, 2*morphologySize + 1 ,  Point morphologySize, morphologySize  ;             Apply morphological opening to the image using the structuring  element     erode inputImage, tempImage, element ;     dilate tempImage, outputImage, element ;             Return the output image     return outputImage; }  As we can see here, we apply erosion and dilation to the image to perform the  morphological opening.  Morphological closing This is an operation that closes a shape by illing the gaps. This operation is also used  for noise removal. We achieve morphological closing by applying dilation followed  by erosion to an image. This operation removes tiny holes in the foreground by  changing small objects in the background into the foreground.  Let's quickly take a look at the function to perform the morphological closing:  Mat performClosing Mat inputImage, int morphologyElement, int  morphologySize  {     Mat outputImage, tempImage;     int morphologyType;       [ 182 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8      if morphologyElement == 0          morphologyType = MORPH_RECT;          else if morphologyElement == 1          morphologyType = MORPH_CROSS;          else if morphologyElement == 2          morphologyType = MORPH_ELLIPSE;             Create the structuring element for erosion     Mat element = getStructuringElement morphologyTy pe, Size 2*morphologySize + 1, 2*morphologySize + 1 ,  Point morphologySize, morphologySize  ;             Apply morphological opening to the image using the structuring  element     dilate inputImage, tempImage, element ;     erode tempImage, outputImage, element ;             Return the output image     return outputImage; }  Drawing the boundary We achieve this using the morphological gradient. This is an operation that draws  the boundary around a shape by taking the difference between dilation and erosion  of an image:  [ 183 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Video Surveillance, Background Modeling, and Morphological Operations  Let's take a look at the function to perform the morphological gradient:  Mat performMorphologicalgradient Mat inputImage, int  morphologyElement, int morphologySize  {     Mat outputImage, tempImage1, tempImage2;     int morphologyType;          if morphologyElement == 0          morphologyType = MORPH_RECT;          else if morphologyElement == 1          morphologyType = MORPH_CROSS;          else if morphologyElement == 2          morphologyType = MORPH_ELLIPSE;             Create the structuring element for erosion     Mat element = getStructuringElement morphologyTy pe, Size 2*morphologySize + 1, 2*morphologySize + 1 ,  Point morphologySize, morphologySize  ;             Apply morphological gradient to the image using the structuring  element     dilate inputImage, tempImage1, element ;     erode inputImage, tempImage2, element ;             Return the output image     return tempImage1 - tempImage2; }  White Top-Hat transform While Top-Hat transform, also simply called Top-Hat transform, extracts iner details  from the images. We can apply white top-hat transform by computing the difference  between the input image and its morphological opening. This gives us the objects in  the image that are smaller than the structuring elements and are brighter than the  surroundings. So, depending on the size of the structuring element, we can extract  various objects in the given image:  [ 184 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8  If you look carefully at the output image, you can see those black rectangles.   This means that the structuring element was able to it in there, and so those   regions are blackened out. Here is the function to do this:  Mat performTopHat Mat inputImage, int morphologyElement, int  morphologySize  {     Mat outputImage;     int morphologyType;          if morphologyElement == 0          morphologyType = MORPH_RECT;          else if morphologyElement == 1          morphologyType = MORPH_CROSS;          else if morphologyElement == 2          morphologyType = MORPH_ELLIPSE;             Create the structuring element for erosion     Mat element = getStructuringElement morphologyTy pe, Size 2*morphologySize + 1, 2*morphologySize + 1 ,  Point morphologySize, morphologySize  ;             Apply top hat operation to the image using the structuring  element     outputImage = inputImage - performOpening inputImage,  morphologyElement, morphologySize ;             Return the output image     return outputImage; }  [ 185 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Video Surveillance, Background Modeling, and Morphological Operations  Black Top-Hat transform Black Top-Hat transform, also simply called Black Hat transform, extracts iner  details from the image as well. We can apply black top-hat transform by computing  the difference between the morphological closing of an image and the image itself.  This gives us the objects in the image that are smaller than the structuring element  and are darker than the surroundings.  Let's take a look at the function to perform the black hat transform:  Mat performBlackHat Mat inputImage, int morphologyElement, int  morphologySize  {     Mat outputImage;     int morphologyType;          if morphologyElement == 0          morphologyType = MORPH_RECT;          else if morphologyElement == 1          morphologyType = MORPH_CROSS;          else if morphologyElement == 2          morphologyType = MORPH_ELLIPSE;             Create the structuring element for erosion     Mat element = getStructuringElement morphologyTy pe, Size 2*morphologySize + 1, 2*morphologySize + 1 ,  Point morphologySize, morphologySize  ;             Apply black hat operation to the image using the structuring  element     outputImage = performClosing inputImage, morphologyElement,  morphologySize  - inputImage;             Return the output image     return outputImage; }  [ 186 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 8  Summary In this chapter, we learned about the algorithms that are used for background  modeling and morphological image processing. We discussed naïve background  subtraction and its limitations. We learned how to get motion information using  frame differencing and how it can be constrain us when we want to track different  types of objects. We also discussed Mixture of Gaussians, along with its formulation  and implementation details. We then discussed morphological image processing.  We learned how it can be used for various purposes and different operations were  demonstrated to show the use cases.  In the next chapter, we will discuss how to track an object and the various techniques  that can be used to do it.  [ 187 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Learning Object Tracking  In the previous chapter, we learned about video surveillance, background modeling,  and morphological image processing. We discussed how we can use different  morphological operators to apply cool visual effects to input images. In this chapter,  we will learn how to track an object in a live video. We will discuss the different  characteristics of an object that can be used to track it. We will also learn about  different methods and techniques used for object tracking. Object tracking is used  extensively in robotics, self-driving cars, vehicle tracking, player tracking in sports,  video compression, and so on.  By the end of this chapter, you will learn:     How to track colored objects    How to build an interactive object tracker    What is a corner detector    How to detect good features to track    How to build an optical flow-based feature tracker  Tracking objects of a speciic color  In order to build a good object tracker, we need to understand what characteristics  can be used to make our tracking robust and accurate. So, let's take a baby step in  this direction, and see how we can use colorspaces to come up with a good visual  tracker. One thing to keep in mind is that the color information is sensitive to  lighting conditions. In real-world applications, you need to do some preprocessing  to take care of this. But for now, let's assume that somebody else is doing this and we  are getting clean color images.  [ 189 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning Object Tracking  There are many different colorspaces and picking up a good one will depend on  what people use for different applications. While RGB is the native representation   on the computer screen, it's not necessarily ideal for humans. When it comes to  humans, we give names to colors that are based on their hue. This is why HSV    Hue Saturation Value  is probably one of the most informative colorspaces. It  closely aligns with how we perceive colors. Hue refers to the color spectrum,  saturation refers to the intensity of a particular color, and value refers to the  brightness of that pixel. This is actually represented in a cylindrical format. You can  refer to a simple explanation about this at http:  infohost.nmt.edu tcc help  pubs colortheory web hsv.html. We can take the pixels of an image to the HSV  space and then use colorspace distances and threshold in this space thresholding to  track a given object.  Consider the following frame in the video:  [ 190 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   If you run it through the colorspace ilter and track the object, you will see something  like this:  Chapter 9  As you can see here, our tracker recognizes a particular object in the video based  on its color characteristics. In order to use this tracker, we need to know the color  distribution of our target object. The following code is used to track a colored object  that selects only pixels that have a certain given hue. The code is well commented, so  read the explanation mentioned previously for each line to see what's happening:  int main int argc, char* argv[]  {        Variable declarations and initializations             Iterate until the user presses the Esc key     while true      {            Initialize the output image before each iteration         outputImage = Scalar 0,0,0 ;                     Capture the current frame         cap >> frame;       [ 191 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning Object Tracking             Check if 'frame' is empty         if frame.empty                break;                     Resize the frame         resize frame, frame, Size  , scalingFactor, scalingFactor,             InTER_AREA ;            Convert to HSV colorspace         cvtColor frame, hsvImage, COLOR_BgR2HSV ;                     Define the range of "blue" color in HSV colorspace         Scalar lowerLimit = Scalar 60,100,100 ;         Scalar upperLimit = Scalar 180,255,255 ;                     Threshold the HSV image to get only blue color         inRange hsvImage, lowerLimit, upperLimit, mask ;                     Compute bitwise-AnD of input image and mask         bitwise_and frame, frame, outputImage, mask=mask ;                     Run median filter on the output to smoothen it         medianBlur outputImage, outputImage, 5 ;                     Display the input and output image         imshow "Input", frame ;         imshow "Output", outputImage ;                     get the keyboard input and check if it's 'Esc'            30 -> wait for 30 ms            27 -> ASCII value of 'ESC' key         ch = waitKey 30 ;         if  ch == 27  {             break;         }     }          return 1; }  Building an interactive object tracker A colorspace-based tracker gives us the freedom to track a colored object, but we  are also constrained to a predeined color. What if we just want to randomly pick  an object? How do we build an object tracker that can learn the characteristics of the  selected object and track it automatically? This is where the CAMShift algorithm,  which stands for Continuously Adaptive Meanshift, comes into the picture. It's  basically an improved version of the Meanshift algorithm.  [ 192 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9  The concept of Meanshift is actually nice and simple. Let's say we select a region of  interest, and we want our object tracker to track that object. In this region, we select  a bunch of points based on the color histogram and compute the centroid of spatial  points. If the centroid lies at the center of this region, we know that the object hasn't  moved. But if the centroid is not at the center of this region, then we know that  the object is moving in some direction. The movement of the centroid controls the  direction in which the object is moving. So, we move the bounding box of the object  to a new location so that the new centroid becomes the center of this bounding box.  Hence, this algorithm is called Meanshift because the mean  that is, the centroid  is  shifting. This way, we keep ourselves updated with the current location of the object.  However, the problem with Meanshift is that the size of the bounding box is not  allowed to change. When you move the object away from the camera, the object  will appear smaller to the human eye, but Meanshift will not take this into account.  The size of the bounding box will remain the same throughout the tracking session.  Hence, we need to use CAMShift. The advantage of CAMShift is that it can adapt  the size of the bounding box to the size of the object. Along with this, it can also keep  track of the orientation of the object.  Let's consider the following igure in which the object is highlighted:  [ 193 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning Object Tracking  Now that we have selected the object, the algorithm computes the histogram  backprojection and extracts all the information. What is histogram backprojection?  It's just a way of identifying how well the image its into our histogram model. We  compute the histogram model of a particular thing, and then use this model to ind  that thing in an image. Let's move the object and see how it gets tracked:  Looks like the object is getting tracked fairly well. Let's change the orientation,   and check whether the tracking is maintained:  [ 194 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   As you can see, the bounding ellipse has changed its location as well as its  orientation. Let's change the perspective of the object, and see whether it's still   able to track it:  Chapter 9  We are still good! The bounding ellipse has changed the aspect ratio to relect the   fact that the object looks skewed now  because of the perspective transformation .  Let's take a look at the user interface functionality in the following code:  Mat image; Point originPoint; Rect selectedRect; bool selectRegion = false; int trackingFlag = 0;     Function to track the mouse events void onMouse int event, int x, int y, int, void*  {     if selectRegion      {         selectedRect.x = MIn x, originPoint.x ;         selectedRect.y = MIn y, originPoint.y ;         selectedRect.width = std::abs x - originPoint.x ;         selectedRect.height = std::abs y - originPoint.y ;           [ 195 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning Object Tracking          selectedRect &= Rect 0, 0, image.cols, image.rows ;     }          switch event      {         case CV_EVEnT_LBUTTOnDOWn:             originPoint = Point x,y ;             selectedRect = Rect x,y,0,0 ;             selectRegion = true;             break;                      case CV_EVEnT_LBUTTOnUP:             selectRegion = false;             if  selectedRect.width > 0 && selectedRect.height > 0               {                 trackingFlag = -1;             }             break;     } }  This function basically captures the coordinates of the rectangle that were selected  in the window. The user just needs to click on them and drag them with the mouse.  There are a set of inbuilt functions in OpenCV that help us detect these different  mouse events.  Here is the code used to perform object tracking based on CAMShift:  int main int argc, char* argv[]  {        Variable declaration and initialization             Iterate until the user presses the Esc key     while true      {            Capture the current frame         cap >> frame;                 Check if 'frame' is empty         if frame.empty                break;           [ 196 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9             Resize the frame         resize frame, frame, Size  , scalingFactor, scalingFactor,             InTER_AREA ;                 Clone the input frame         frame.copyTo image ;                 Convert to HSV colorspace         cvtColor image, hsvImage, COLOR_BgR2HSV ;  We now have the HSV image waiting to be processed at this point. Let's go ahead  and see how we can use our thresholds to process this image:          if trackingFlag          {                Check for all the values in 'hsvimage' that are               within the specified range                and put the result in 'mask'             inRange hsvImage, Scalar 0, minSaturation, minValue ,                 Scalar 180, 256, maxValue , mask ;                             Mix the specified channels             int channels[] = {0, 0};             hueImage.create hsvImage.size  , hsvImage.depth   ;             mixChannels &hsvImage, 1, &hueImage, 1, channels, 1 ;                          if trackingFlag < 0              {                Create images based on selected regions of interest                 Mat roi hueImage, selectedRect , maskroi mask,                     selectedRect ;                                     Compute the histogram and normalize it                 calcHist &roi, 1, 0, maskroi, hist, 1, &histSize,                     &histRanges ;                 normalize hist, hist, 0, 255, CV_MInMAX ;                                  trackingRect = selectedRect;                 trackingFlag = 1;             }  [ 197 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning Object Tracking  As you can see here, we use the HSV image to compute the histogram of the region.  We use our thresholds to locate the required color in the HSV spectrum and then  ilter out the image based on that. Let's go ahead and see how we can compute the  histogram backprojection:                 Compute the histogram backprojection             calcBackProject &hueImage, 1, 0, hist, backproj,                   &histRanges ;             backproj &= mask;             RotatedRect rotatedTrackingRect = CamShift backproj,                   trackingRect, TermCriteria CV_TERMCRIT_EPS                      CV_TERMCRIT_ITER, 10, 1  ;                             Check if the area of trackingRect is too small             if trackingRect.area   <= 1              {                    Use an offset value to make sure the   trackingRect has a minimum size                 int cols = backproj.cols, rows = backproj.rows;                 int offset = MIn rows, cols  + 1;                 trackingRect = Rect trackingRect.x - offset,                   trackingRect.y - offset, trackingRect.x + offset,                   trackingRect.y + offset  & Rect 0, 0, cols, rows ;             }  We are now ready to display the results. Using the rotated rectangle, let's draw an  ellipse around our region of interest:                 Draw the ellipse on top of the image             ellipse image, rotatedTrackingRect, Scalar 0,255,0 , 3,  CV_AA ;         }                     Apply the 'negative' effect on the selected region of  interest         if selectRegion && selectedRect.width > 0 && selectedRect. height > 0          {             Mat roi image, selectedRect ;             bitwise_not roi, roi ;         }                     Display the output image         imshow windowname, image ;           [ 198 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9             get the keyboard input and check if it's 'Esc'            27 -> ASCII value of 'Esc' key         ch = waitKey 30 ;         if  ch == 27  {             break;         }     }          return 1; }  Detecting points using the Harris corner  detector Corner detection is a technique used to detect interest points in the image. These  interest points are also called feature points or simply features in Computer Vision  terminology. A corner is basically an intersection of two edges. An interest point  is basically something that can be uniquely detected in an image. A corner is a  particular case of an interest point. These interest points help us characterize an  image. These points are used extensively in applications, such as object tracking,  image classiication, visual search, and so on. Since we know that the corners are  interesting, let's see how we can detect them.  In Computer Vision, there is a popular corner detection technique called the Harris  corner detector. We construct a 2 x 2 matrix based on partial derivatives of the  grayscale image, and then analyze the eigenvalues. Now what does this mean? Well,  let's dissect it so that we can understand it better. Let's consider a small patch in the  image. Our goal is to check whether this patch has a corner in it. So, we consider all  the neighboring patches and compute the intensity difference between our patch  and all those neighboring patches. If the difference is high in all directions, then we  know that our patch has a corner in it. This is actually an oversimpliication of the  actual algorithm, but it covers the gist. If you want to understand the underlying  mathematical details, you can take a look at the original paper by Harris and  Stephens at http:  www.bmva.org bmvc 1988 avc-88-023.pdf. A corner   point is a point where both the eigenvalues would have large values.  [ 199 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning Object Tracking  If we run the Harris corner detector, it will look like this:  As you can see, the green circles on the TV remote are the detected corners. This  will change based on the parameters you choose for the detector. If you modify the  parameters, you can see that more points might get detected. If you make it strict,  then you might not be able to detect soft corners. Let's take a look at the following  code to detect Harris corners:  int main int argc, char* argv[]  {        Variable declaration and initialization             Iterate until the user presses the Esc key     while true      {            Capture the current frame         cap >> frame;                     Resize the frame         resize frame, frame, Size  , scalingFactor, scalingFactor,             InTER_AREA ;                  dst = Mat::zeros frame.size  , CV_32FC1 ;           [ 200 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9             Convert to grayscale         cvtColor frame, framegray, COLOR_BgR2gRAY  ;                     Detecting corners         cornerHarris framegray, dst, blockSize, apertureSize, k,             BORDER_DEFAULT ;                     normalizing         normalize dst, dst_norm, 0, 255, nORM_MInMAX, CV_32FC1,             Mat   ;         convertScaleAbs dst_norm, dst_norm_scaled ;  We converted the image to grayscale and detected corners using our parameters.  You can ind the complete code in the .cpp iles. These parameters play an important  role in the number of points that will be detected. You can check out the OpenCV  documentation of the Harris corner detector at http:  docs.opencv.org 2.4  modules imgproc doc feature_detection.html?highlight=cornerharrisv oid cornerHarris InputArray src, OutputArray dst, int blockSize, int  ksize, double k, int borderType .  We now have all the information that we need. Let's go ahead and draw circles  around our corners to display the results:             Drawing a circle around each corner         for int j = 0; j < dst_norm.rows ; j++          {             for int i = 0; i < dst_norm.cols; i++              {                 if  int dst_norm.at  j,i  > thresh                  {                     circle frame, Point i, j , 8,  Scalar 0,255,0 , 2,  8, 0 ;                 }             }         }                     Showing the result         imshow windowname, frame ;                     get the keyboard input and check if it's 'Esc'            27 -> ASCII value of 'Esc' key         ch = waitKey 10 ;         if  ch == 27  {             break;         }     }             Release the video capture object  [ 201 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning Object Tracking      cap.release  ;             Close all windows     destroyAllWindows  ;          return 1; }  As you can see, this code takes a blockSize input argument. Depending on the size  you choose, the performance will vary. Start with a value of 4 and play around with  it to see what happens.  Shi-Tomasi Corner Detector The Harris corner detector performs well in many cases, but it can still be improved.  Around six years after the original paper by Harris and Stephens, Shi-Tomasi came  up with something better and they called it Good Features To Track. You can read the  original paper at: http:  www.ai.mit.edu courses 6.891 handouts shi94good. pdf. They used a different scoring function to improve the overall quality. Using this  method, we can ind the N strongest corners in the given image. This is very useful  when we don't want to use every single corner to extract information from the image.  As discussed earlier, a good interest point detector is very useful in applications,  such as object tracking, object recognition, image search, and so on.  If you apply the Shi-Tomasi corner detector to an image, you will see something   like this:  [ 202 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   As you can see here, all the important points in the frame are captured. Let's take a  look at the following code to track these features:  Chapter 9  int main int argc, char* argv[]  {        Variable declaration and initialization             Iterate until the user presses the Esc key     while true      {            Capture the current frame         cap >> frame;                     Resize the frame         resize frame, frame, Size  , scalingFactor, scalingFactor,             InTER_AREA ;                     Convert to grayscale         cvtColor frame, framegray, COLOR_BgR2gRAY  ;                     Initialize the parameters for Shi-Tomasi algorithm         vector  corners;         double qualityThreshold = 0.02;         double minDist = 15;         int blockSize = 5;         bool useHarrisDetector = false;         double k = 0.07;                     Clone the input frame         Mat frameCopy;         frameCopy = frame.clone  ;                     Apply corner detection         goodFeaturesToTrack framegray, corners, numCorners,             qualityThreshold, minDist, Mat  , blockSize,             useHarrisDetector, k ;  We extracted the frame and used goodFeaturesToTrack to detect the corners. It's  important to understand that the number of corners detected will depend on our  choice of parameters.

Let's go ahead and draw circles on these  points to display the output image:             Parameters for the circles to display the corners         int radius = 8;         radius of the cirles         int thickness = 2;      thickness of the circles         int lineType = 8;           [ 203 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning Object Tracking             Draw the detected corners using circles         for size_t i = 0; i < corners.size  ; i++          {             Scalar color = Scalar rng.uniform 0,255 ,                   rng.uniform 0,255 , rng.uniform 0,255  ;             circle frameCopy, corners[i], radius, color,                   thickness, lineType, 0 ;         }                      Show what you got         imshow windowname, frameCopy ;                     get the keyboard input and check if it's 'Esc'            27 -> ASCII value of 'Esc' key         ch = waitKey 30 ;         if  ch == 27  {             break;         }     }             Release the video capture object     cap.release  ;             Close all windows     destroyAllWindows  ;          return 1; }  This program takes a numCorners input argument. This value indicates the  maximum number of corners you want to track. Start with a value of 100 and play  around with it to see what happens. If you increase this value, you will see more  feature points getting detected.  Feature-based tracking Feature-based tracking refers to tracking individual feature points across successive  frames in the video. The advantage here is that we don't have to detect feature points  in every single frame. We can just detect them once and keep tracking them after  that. This is more eficient as compared to running the detector on every frame. We  use a technique called optical low to track these features. Optical low is one of the  most popular techniques in Computer Vision. We choose a bunch of feature points,  and track them through the video stream. When we detect the feature points, we  compute the displacement vectors and show the motion of those keypoints between  consecutive frames. These vectors are called motion vectors.   [ 204 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   A motion vector for a particular point is just a directional line that indicates where  that point has moved as compared to the previous frame. Different methods are   used to detect these motion vectors. The two most popular algorithms are the   Lucas-Kanade method and Farneback algorithm.  Chapter 9  The Lucas-Kanade method The Lucas-Kanade method is used for sparse optical low tracking. By sparse,  we mean that the number of feature points is relatively low. You can refer to  their original paper at http:  cseweb.ucsd.edu classes sp02 cse252  lucaskanade81.pdf. We start the process by extracting the feature points. For each  feature point, we create 3 x 3 patches with the feature point at the center. We assume  that all the points within each patch will have a similar motion. We can adjust the  size of this window, depending on the problem at hand.  For each feature point in the current frame, we take the surrounding 3 x 3 patch as  our reference point. For this patch, we take a look at its neighborhood in the previous  frame to get the best match. This neighborhood is usually bigger than 3 x 3 because  we want to get the patch that's closest to the patch under consideration. Now, the  path from the center pixel of the matched patch in the previous frame to the center  pixel of the patch under consideration in the current frame will become the motion  vector. We do this for all the feature points, and extract all the motion vectors.  Let's consider the following frame:  [ 205 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning Object Tracking  We need to add some points that we want to track. Just go ahead and click on a  bunch of points on this window with your mouse:  If I move to a different position, you will see that the points are still being tracked  correctly within a small margin of error:  [ 206 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Let's add a lot of points and see what happens:  Chapter 9  As you can see, it will keep tracking those points. However, you will notice  that some of the points will be dropped in between because of factors, such as  prominence, speed of the movement, and so on. If you want to play around with  it, you can just keep adding more points to it. You can also allow the user to select  a region of interest in the input video. You can then extract feature points from this  region of interest and track the object by drawing the bounding box. It will be a   fun exercise!  Here is the code used to perform Lucas-Kanade-based tracking:  int main int argc, char* argv[]  {        Variable declaration and initialization             Iterate until the user hits the Esc key     while true      {            Capture the current frame         cap >> frame;                     Check if the frame is empty         if frame.empty     [ 207 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning Object Tracking              break;                     Resize the frame         resize frame, frame, Size  , scalingFactor, scalingFactor,  InTER_AREA ;                     Copy the input frame         frame.copyTo image ;                     Convert the image to grayscale         cvtColor image, curgrayImage, COLOR_BgR2gRAY ;                     Check if there are points to track         if !trackingPoints[0].empty            {                Status vector to indicate whether the flow for the  corresponding features has been found             vector  statusVector;                             Error vector to indicate the error for the  corresponding feature             vector  errorVector;                             Check if previous image is empty             if prevgrayImage.empty                {                 curgrayImage.copyTo prevgrayImage ;             }                             Calculate the optical flow using Lucas-Kanade algorithm             calcOpticalFlowPyrLK prevgrayImage, curgrayImage,  trackingPoints[0], trackingPoints[1], statusVector, errorVector,  windowSize, 3, terminationCriteria, 0, 0.001 ;  We use the current image and the previous image to compute the optical low  information. Needless to say that the quality of the output will depend on the  parameters you have chosen. You can ind more details about the parameters at  http:  docs.opencv.org 2.4 modules video doc motion_analysis_and_ object_tracking.htmlcalcopticalflowpyrlk. To increase the quality and  robustness, we need to ilter out the points that are very close to each other because  they do not add the new information. Let's go ahead and do that:              int count = 0;                             Minimum distance between any two tracking points             int minDist = 7;               [ 208 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9              for int i=0; i < trackingPoints[1].size  ; i++              {                 if pointTrackingFlag                  {                      * If the new point is within 'minDist' distance  from an existing point, it will not be tracked *                      if norm currentPoint - trackingPoints[1][i]  <=  minDist                      {                         pointTrackingFlag = false;                         continue;                     }                 }                                     Check if the status vector is good                 if !statusVector[i]                      continue;                                  trackingPoints[1][count++] = trackingPoints[1][i];           Draw a filled circle for each of the tracking points                 int radius = 8;                 int thickness = 2;                 int lineType = 8;                 circle image, trackingPoints[1][i], radius,                     Scalar 0,255,0 , thickness, lineType ;             }                          trackingPoints[1].resize count ;         }  We now have the tracking points. The next step is to reine the location of these  points. What exactly does "reine" mean in this context? To increase the speed of  computation, there is some level of quantization involved. In layman's terms, you  can think of it as "rounding off". Now that we have the approximate region, we can  reine the location of the point within that region to get a more accurate outcome.  Let's go ahead and do this:             Refining the location of the feature points         if pointTrackingFlag && trackingPoints[1].size   <             maxnumPoints          {             vector  tempPoints;             tempPoints.push_back currentPoint ;                             Function to refine the location of the corners to  subpixel accuracy.

Dense tracking is used extensively in robotics, augmented reality, 3D  mapping, and so on. You can check out the original paper at http:  www.diva- portal.org smash get diva2:273847 FULLTEXT01.pdf. The Lucas-Kanade  method is a sparse technique, which means that we only need to process some pixels  in the entire image. The Farneback algorithm, on the other hand, is a dense technique  that requires us to process all the pixels in the given image. So, obviously, there is  a trade-off here. Dense techniques are more accurate, but they are slower. Sparse  techniques are less accurate, but they are faster. For real-time applications, people  tend to prefer sparse techniques. For applications where time and complexity is not a  factor, people prefer dense techniques to extract iner details.  [ 210 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9  In his paper, Farneback describes a method for dense optical low estimation  based on polynomial expansion for two frames. Our goal is to estimate the motion  between these two frames, and it's basically a three-step process. In the irst step,  each neighborhood in both the frames is approximated by polynomials. In this case,  we are only interested in quadratic polynomials. The next step is to construct a new  signal by global displacement. Now that each neighborhood is approximated by  a polynomial, we need to see what happens if this polynomial undergoes an ideal  translation. The last step is to compute the global displacement by equating the  coeficients in the yields of these quadratic polynomials.  Now, how is this feasible? If you think about it, we are assuming that an entire signal  is a single polynomial and there is a global translation relating the two signals. This  is not a realistic scenario. So, what are we looking for? Well, our goal is to ind out  whether these errors are small enough so that we can build a useful algorithm that  can track the features.  Let's take a look at the following static image:  [ 211 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning Object Tracking  If I move sideways, you can see that the motion vectors point in the horizontal  direction. They simply track the movement of my head:  If I move away from the webcam, you can see that the motion vectors point in a  direction that is perpendicular to the image plane:  [ 212 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Here is the code used to perform optical low-based tracking using the   Farneback algorithm:  Chapter 9  int main int, char** argv  {        Variable declaration and initialization             Iterate until the user presses the Esc key     while true      {            Capture the current frame         cap >> frame;                  if frame.empty                break;                     Resize the frame         resize frame, frame, Size  , scalingFactor, scalingFactor,  InTER_AREA ;                     Convert to grayscale         cvtColor frame, curgray, COLOR_BgR2gRAY ;                     Check if the image is valid         if prevgray.data          {                Initialize parameters for the optical flow algorithm             float pyrScale = 0.5;             int numLevels = 3;             int windowSize = 15;             int numIterations = 3;             int neighborhoodSize = 5;             float stdDeviation = 1.2;                             Calculate optical flow map using Farneback algorithm             calcOpticalFlowFarneback prevgray, curgray, flowImage,  pyrScale, numLevels, windowSize, numIterations, neighborhoodSize,  stdDeviation, OPTFLOW_USE_InITIAL_FLOW ;  [ 213 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Learning Object Tracking  As you can see, we use the Farneback algorithm to compute the optical low vectors.  The calcOpticalFlowFarneback input parameters are important when it comes to  the quality of tracking. You can ind the details about these parameters at http:   docs.opencv.org 3.0-beta modules video doc motion_analysis_and_ object_tracking.html. Let's go ahead and draw those vectors on the output image:                 Convert to 3-channel RgB             cvtColor prevgray, flowImagegray, COLOR_gRAY2BgR ;                             Draw the optical flow map             drawOpticalFlow flowImage, flowImagegray ;                             Display the output image             imshow windowname, flowImagegray ;         }                     Break out of the loop if the user presses the Esc key         ch = waitKey 10 ;         if ch == 27              break;                     Swap previous image with the current image         std::swap prevgray, curgray ;     }          return 1; }  We used a function called drawOpticalFlow to draw these optical low vectors.  These vectors indicate the direction of the motion. Let's take a look at the function to  see how we can draw these vectors:     Function to compute the optical flow map void drawOpticalFlow const Mat& flowImage, Mat& flowImagegray  {     int stepSize = 16;     Scalar color = Scalar 0, 255, 0 ;             Draw the uniform grid of points on the input image along with  the motion vectors     for int y = 0; y < flowImagegray.rows; y += stepSize      {         for int x = 0; x < flowImagegray.cols; x += stepSize          {  [ 214 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 9                 Circles to indicate the uniform grid of points             int radius = 2;             int thickness = -1;             circle flowImagegray, Point x,y , radius, color,  thickness ;                             Lines to indicate the motion vectors             Point2f pt = flowImage.at  y, x ;             line flowImagegray, Point x,y , Point cvRound x+pt.x ,  cvRound y+pt.y  , color ;         }     } }  Summary In this chapter, we learned about object tracking. We learned how to use the HSV  colorspace to track colored objects. We discussed clustering techniques used  for object tracking and how we can build an interactive object tracker using the  CAMShift algorithm. We learned about corner detectors and how to track corners  in a live video. We discussed how to track features in a video using optical low.  We also learned the concepts behind Lucas-Kanade and Farneback algorithms and  implemented them as well.  In the next chapter, we will discuss segmentation algorithms and see how we can use  them for text recognition.  [ 215 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Developing Segmentation  Algorithms for Text  Recognition  In the previous chapters, we learned about a wide range of image processing  techniques, such as thresholding, contour descriptors, and mathematical  morphology. In this chapter, we will discuss the common problems with dealing  with scanned documents, such as identifying where the text is or adjusting its  rotation. We will also learn how to combine techniques presented in the previous  chapters to solve these problems. Finally, we'll have segmented regions of text that  can be sent to an OCR  optical character recognition  library.  By the end of this chapter, you should be able to answer the following questions:     What kind of OCR applications exist?    What are the common problems while writing an OCR application?    How do we identify regions of documents?    How do we deal with problems such as skewing and other elements in the   middle of the text?     How do we use Tesseract OCR to identify the text?  [ 217 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Developing Segmentation Algorithms for Text Recognition  Introducing optical character recognition Identifying text in an image is a very popular application for Computer Vision.   This process is commonly called OCR and divided into the following steps:     Text preprocessing and segmentation: During this step, the computer must  learn to deal with the image noise and rotation  skewing  and identify what  areas are candidate text areas.     Text identification: This is a process used to identify each letter in a text.   Although this is also a Computer Vision topic, we will not show you how to  do this in this book using OpenCV. Instead, we will show you how to use the  Tesseract library to do this step, since it was integrated with OpenCV 3.0. If  you are interested in learning how to do what Tesseract does all by yourself,  take a look at Mastering OpenCV, Packt Publishing, which presents a chapter  about car license plate recognition.  The preprocessing and segmentation phase can vary greatly depending on the source  of the text. Let's take a look at the common situations where preprocessing is done:     Production OCR applications with a scanner, which is a very reliable source   of text: In this scenario, the background of the image is usually white and  the document is almost aligned with the scanner margins. The content that  is being scanned basically contains text with almost no noise. This kind of  application relies on simple preprocessing techniques that can adjust the text  quickly and maintain a fast scanning pace. When writing production OCR  software, it is common to delegate identification of important text regions to  the user and create a quality pipeline for text verification and indexing.     Scanning text in a casually taken picture or in a video: This is a much more   complex scenario, as there's no indication of where the text can be. This  scenario is called Scene text recognition, and OpenCV 3.0 introduces a brand  new library to deal with it, which we will cover in Chapter 11, Text Recognition  with Tesseract. Usually, the preprocessor will use texture analysis techniques  to identify the text patterns.     Creating a production quality OCR for historical texts: Historical texts are   also scanned.  However, they have several additional problems, such as noise created by  the old paper color and usage of ink. Other common problems are decorated  letters, specific text fonts, and low-contrast content created by ink that has  been degraded over time. It's not uncommon to write specific OCR software  for documents at hand.  [ 218 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10     Scanning maps, diagrams, and charts: Maps, diagrams, and charts pose a   difficult scenario since the text is usually in any orientation and in the middle  of an image's content. For example, city names are often clustered, and ocean  names often follow country shore contour lines. Some charts are heavily  colored, with text appearing in both clear and dark tones.  OCR application strategies also vary according to the objective of the identiication.  Will they be used for a full text search? Or should the text be separated in a logical  ield to index a database with information for a structured search?  In this chapter, we will focus on preprocessing scanned text or text photographed by  a camera. We'll assume that the text is the main purpose of the image, such as in a  photograph, paper, or card; for example, take a look at the following parking ticket:  [ 219 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Developing Segmentation Algorithms for Text Recognition  We'll try to remove the common noise, deal with text rotation  if any , and crop the  possible text regions. While most OCR APIs already do these things automatically  and probably with state-of-the-art algorithms, it still worth knowing how things  happen under the hood. This will allow you to better understand most OCR APIs'  parameters and will give you a better knowledge of potential OCR problems that  you may face.  The preprocessing step Software that identiies letters do so by comparing text with a previously recorded  data. Classiication results can be improved greatly if the input text is clear, if the  letters are in a vertical position, and if there are no other elements, such as images  that are sent to the classiication software. In this section, we'll learn how to adjust  text. This stage is called preprocessing.  Thresholding the image We usually start the preprocessing stage by thresholding the image. This eliminates  all the color information. Most OpenCV functions require information to be the  written in white and the background to be black. So, let's start with creating a  threshold function to match this criterion:  include   include    using namespace std; using namespace cv;  Mat binarize Mat input  {     Uses otsu to threshold the input image   Mat binaryImage;   cvtColor input, input, CV_BgR2gRAY ;   threshold input, binaryImage, 0, 255, THRESH_OTSU ;     Count the number of black and white pixels   int white = countnonZero binaryImage ;   int black = binaryImage.size  .area   - white;     If the image is mostly white  white background , invert it   return white < black ? binaryImage : ~binaryImage; }  [ 220 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10  The binarize function applies a threshold, similar to what we did in Chapter 4,  Delving into Histograms and Filters. However, we use the Otsu method by passing  THRESH_OTSU to the fourth parameter of the function.  The Otsu method maximizes the inter-class variance. Since a threshold creates only  two classes  the black and white pixels , this is the same as minimizing the intra-class  variance. The method works using the image histogram. Then, it iterates through all  the possible threshold values and calculates a measure of spread for the pixel values  on each side of the threshold, that is, the pixels that are either in the background or  in the foreground of the image. The purpose is to ind the threshold value where the  sum of both the spreads is at its minimum.  After the thresholding is done, the function counts the number of white pixels in the  image. The black pixels are simply the total number of pixels in the image, given by  the image area minus the white pixel count.  Since text is usually written on a plain background, we will check whether there are  more white pixels than black. In this case, we are dealing with black text over a white  background, so we invert the image for further processing.  The result of the thresholding process with the parking ticket image is shown in the  following image:  [ 221 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Developing Segmentation Algorithms for Text Recognition  Text segmentation The next step is to ind where the text is located and extract it. There are two  common strategies to do this, which are as follows:     Using the connected component analysis, we search for groups of connected   pixels in the image. This is the technique that we will use in this chapter.     Use classifiers to search for a previously trained letter texture pattern.   Texture features such as Haralick features and wavelet transforms are often  used. The other option is to identify maximally stable extremal regions   MSERs  in this task. This approach is more robust for text in a complex  background and will be studied in the next chapter. You can read about  Haralick features on his own website at http:  haralick.org journals  TexturalFeatures.pdf.  Creating connected areas If you take a closer look at the image, you'll notice that the letters are always grouped  together in blocks that are formed by each of text paragraphs. So, how do we detect  and remove these blocks?  The irst step is to make these blocks even more evident. We can do this using the  dilation morphological operator. In Chapter 8, Video Surveillance, Background Modeling,  and Morphological Operations, we learned how dilation makes the image elements  thicker. Let's take a look at the following code snippet that does the trick:  Mat kernel = getStructuringElement MORPH_CROSS, Size 3,3  ; Mat dilated; dilate input, dilated, kernel, cv::Point -1, -1 , 5 ; imshow "Dilated", dilated ;  In this code, we start by creating a 3 x 3 cross kernel that will be used in the  morphological operation. Then, we apply the dilation ive times, centered on this  kernel. The exact kernel size and number of times vary according to the situation.  Just make sure that the values glue all the letters in the same line together.  The result of this operation is as follows:  [ 222 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10  Notice that now we have huge white blocks. They exactly match each paragraph   of the text and also match other nontextual elements such as images or the   border noise.  The ticket image that comes with the code is a low resolution image. OCR  engines usually work with high resolution images  200 or 300 DPI , so it  may be necessary to apply dilation more than ive times.  [ 223 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Developing Segmentation Algorithms for Text Recognition  Identifying paragraph blocks The next step is to perform connect component analysis to ind blocks that  correspond to paragraphs. OpenCV has a function to do this, which we previously  used in Chapter 5, Automated Optical Inspection, Object Segmentation, and Detection. It's  the findContours function:  vector  > contours; findContours dilated, contours, RETR_EXTERnAL, CHAIn_APPROX_SIMPLE ;  In the irst parameter, we pass our dilated image. The second parameter is the vector  of detected contours. Then we use the option to retrieve only external contours and  use simple approximation. The image contours are presented in the following igure.  Each tone of gray represents a different contour:  [ 224 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10  The last step is to identify the minimum rotated bounding rectangle of each contour.  OpenCV provides a handy function for this operation called minAreaRect. This  function receives a vector of arbitrary points and returns a RoundedRect that  contains the bounding box.  This is also a good opportunity to discard unwanted rectangles, that is, rectangles  that are obviously not text. Since we are making a software for OCR, we'll assume  that the text contains a group of letters together. With this assumption, we'll discard  text in the following situations:     The rectangle width or size is too small, that is, smaller than 20 pixels.    This will help you discard border noise and other small artifacts.     The rectangles of the images that have a width height proportion smaller   than two. That is, rectangles that resemble a square, such as image icons, or  ones that are much taller and larger will also be discarded.  There's a little caveat in the second condition. Since we are dealing with rotated  bounding boxes, we must check whether the bounding box angle is not smaller than  45 degrees. If that's the case, the text will be vertically rotated, so the proportion that  must be taken into account is the height width. Let's take a look at this code:    For each contour vector  areas; for  auto contour : contours  {     Find it's rotated rect   auto box = minAreaRect contour ;      Discard very small boxes   if  box.size.width < 20  box.size.height < 20      continue;      Discard squares shaped boxes and boxes     higher than larger   double proportion = box.angle < -45.0 ?     box.size.height   box.size.width :     box.size.width   box.size.height;   if  proportion < 2      continue;     Add the box   areas.push_back box ; }  [ 225 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Developing Segmentation Algorithms for Text Recognition  Let's see the boxes that are selected by this algorithm:  This is certainly a good result!  [ 226 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Notice that the algorithm described in condition 2 will also discard single letters.  This is not a big issue, since we are creating an OCR preprocessor, and single  symbols are usually meaningless with the context information. One example of  such a case is the page numbers. They will be discarded with this process since they  usually appear alone at the bottom of the page and will deinitely fail the size or  proportion text. However, this will not be a problem, as after the text passes through  the OCR, there will be a huge text ile with no page division at all.  Chapter 10  We'll place this code in a function with this signature:  vector  findTextAreas Mat input   Text extraction and skew adjustment Now, all we need to do is extract the text and adjust text skew. This is done by the  deskewAndCrop function, as follows:  Mat deskewAndCrop Mat input, const RotatedRect& box  {   double angle = box.angle;   Size2f size = box.size;      Adjust the box angle    if  angle < -45.0    {         angle += 90.0;          std::swap size.width, size.height ;   }        Rotate the text according to the angle   Mat transform = getRotationMatrix2D box.center, angle, 1.0 ;   Mat rotated;   warpAffine input, rotated, transform, input.size  , InTER_CUBIC ;      Crop the result   Mat cropped;   getRectSubPix rotated, size, box.center, cropped ;   copyMakeBorder cropped,cropped,10,10,10,10,BORDER_COnSTAnT,      Scalar 0  ;   return cropped; }  [ 227 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Developing Segmentation Algorithms for Text Recognition  First, we start by reading the desired region, angle, and size. As mentioned earlier,  the angle can be less than 45 degrees. This means that the text is vertically aligned,  so we need to add 90 degrees to the rotation angle and switch the width and height  properties.  Next, we need to rotate the text. First, we start by creating a 2D afine transformation  matrix that describes the rotation. We do this using the getRotationMatrix2D  OpenCV function. This function takes the following three parameters:     CEnTER: This is the central position of the rotation. The rotation will pivot   around this center. In our case, we use the box center.     AngLE: This is the rotation angle. If the angle is negative, the rotation will   occur in the clockwise direction.     SCALE: This is an isotropic scale factor. We use 1.0 as we want to keep the   box's original scale untouched.  The rotation itself is made using the warpAffine function. This function takes four  mandatory arguments, which are as follows:     SRC: This is the input mat array to be transformed.    DST: This is the destination mat array.    M: This is a transformation matrix. This matrix is a 2 x 3 affine transformation   matrix. This may be a translation, scale, or rotation matrix. In our case, we  just use the matrix that we recently created.     SIZE: This is the size of the output image. We will generate an image with the   same size as that of our input image.  The other three optional arguments are as follows:     FLAgS: This indicates how the image should be interpolated. We use   BICUBIC_InTERPOLATIOn for better quality. The default value is LInEAR_ InTERPOLATIOn.     BORDER: This is the border mode. We use the default BORDER_COnSTAnT.    BORDER VALUE: This is the color of the border. We use the default value,   which is black.  [ 228 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10  Then, we use the getRectSubPix function. After we rotate our image, we need to  crop the rectangular area of our bounding box. This function takes four mandatory  arguments and one optional, and returns the cropped image:     IMAgE: This is the image to be cropped.    SIZE: This is a cv::Size object that describes the width and height of the box   to be cropped.     CEnTER: This is the central pixel of the area to be cropped. Notice that as we   rotate around the center, this point remains the same.     PATCH: This is the destination image.    PATCH_TYPE: This is the depth of the destination image. We use the default   value, representing the same depth as that of the source image.  The inal step is done by the copyMakeBorder function. This function adds a border  around the image. This is important because the classiication stage usually expects  a margin around the text. The function parameters are very simple: the input and  output images, the border thickness around the top, bottom, left, and right of the  image, and the color of the new border.  For the card image, the following images will be generated:  [ 229 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Developing Segmentation Algorithms for Text Recognition  Now, it's time to put every function together. Let's present the main method that will  do the following:     Load the ticket image    Call our binarization function    Find all text regions    Show each region in a window:  int main int argc, char* argv[]  {     Loads the ticket image and binarize it   Mat ticket = binarize imread "ticket.png"  ;   auto regions = findTextAreas ticket ;        For each region   for  auto& region : regions  {       Crop      auto cropped = deskewAndCrop ticket, region ;       Show     imshow "Cropped text", cropped ;     waitKey 0 ;     destroyWindow "Border Skew" ;   } }  For the complete source code, take a look at the segment.cpp  ile that comes along with this book.  Installing Tesseract OCR on your  operating system Tesseract is an open source OCR engine originally developed by Hewlett-Packard  Laboratories, Bristol and Hewlett-Packard Co. It has all the code licenses under the  Apache License and is hosted on GitHub at https:  github.com tesseract-ocr.  It is considered one of the most accurate OCR engines that is available. It can   read a wide variety of image formats and can convert text written in more than   60 languages.  In this session, we will teach you how to install Tesseract on Windows or Mac.   Since there are lots of Linux distributions, we will not teach you how to install   on this operating system.  [ 230 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10  Normally, Tesseract offers installation packages in your package repository,   so before you compile Tesseract, just search there.  Installing Tesseract on Windows Although Tesseract is hosted on GitHub, its latest Windows installer is still   available in the old repository on Google Code. The latest installer version is   3.02.02, and it's recommended that you use the installer. Download the installer   from https:  code.google.com p tesseract-ocr downloads list.  Once you have downloaded the installer, perform these steps:  1.  Look for the tesseract-ocr-setup-3.02.02.exe and tesseract- 3.02.02-win32-lib-include-dirs.zip iles, and download and   run the executable installer  2.  To get past the welcome screen, read and accept the license agreement.  3.  Choose between installing for all users in the computer or just for your user.  4.  Then, choose a suitable location for your installation.  [ 231 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Developing Segmentation Algorithms for Text Recognition  5.  Choose the folder of the installation. Tesseract points to the program files  folder by default, since it has a command-line interface. You can change it to  a more suitable folder, if you want. Then, go to the next screen:  6.  Make sure you select Tesseract development iles. This will install the   Leptonica library iles and source code. You can also choose language data  for your native language. Tesseract has English selected by default.  7.  The installer will download and set up Tesseract dependencies.  To test the Tesseract installation, you can run it via the command  line. For example, to run Tesseract on the parkingTicket.png  file, you can run the following command:  tesseract parkingTicket.png ticket.txt  [ 232 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   8.  Now, go back to the downloaded tesseract-3.02.02-win32-lib-  include-dirs.zip ile. Unzip this ile and copy the lib and add folders to  your tesseract installation folder. There will be folders with the same name  in this folder, but that's normal. This ile will include tesseract iles and  libraries in the Tesseract installation. Ironically, Tesseract libs and dlls do  not come with the installer.  Chapter 10  Setting up Tesseract in Visual Studio Since Visual Studio 2010 is the recommended IDE for Windows developers with  Tesseract, it's important to set this up correctly.  The setup process is quite simple, and it's divided into the following three steps:  1.  Adjust the import and library paths.  2.  Add the libraries to the linker input.  3.  Add Tesseract dlls to the windows path.  Let's see each of these steps in the following sections.  Setting the import and library paths The import path tells Visual Studio where to search for the .h iles that will be  available when an include directive is performed in your code.  In solution explorer, right-click on your project and click on properties.   Then, select coniguration properties and VC++ Directories.  If you have created a new project from scratch, make sure you  added at least one c++ ile to the project to let Visual know  that this is a C++ project.  [ 233 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Developing Segmentation Algorithms for Text Recognition  Next, click on Include Directories. An arrow appears. Click on this arrow and then  click on Edit:  You must add two directories to this list:  TesseractInstallPath\include TesseractInstallPath\include\leptonica  Replace the TesseractInstallPath with your Tesseract installation path; for  example, c:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR.  Then, click on Library Directories, click on the arrow, and then on Edit, just like you  did for Include Directories. You must add one directory to the list:  TesseractInstallPath\lib  [ 234 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Coniguring the linker While still on the Property page, go to Linker  Input. Edit the Additional  Dependencies row and include two libraries:  Chapter 10  liblept168.lib libtesseract302.lib  Since the numbers in the lib name refer to the ile version,  the library names can change if you install a different  version of Tesseract. To do this, just open the lib path in  Windows Explorer. Unfortunately, the debug libraries  the ones that end with  a d letter  do not work out of the box with Tesseract. If you  really need to use them, you need to compile Tesseract and  Leptonica yourself.  Adding the libraries to the windows path You must add two library iles to the windows path. The irst is located directly  in TesseractInstallPath and it is called liblept168.dll. The second one is in  TesseractInstallPath\lib and it is called libtesseract302.dll. There are two  ways to do this:     Copy these files to a location where Visual Studio generates your executable   file. This will not add the files to the Windows path but will allow the  application to run.     Copy these files to a folder that is configured in the Windows path. You can  configure a new folder in the Windows path by changing the environment  variables in System Properties.  Some internet tutorials teach you to include these files in folders, such  as Windows\System32. Do not do this. If you do this, it can be hard to  change the library version in the future, since this folder has a lot of other  dlls systems, and you may lose track of what you already placed in  there. Also, you can always disable a custom path to test an installer and  check whether you forgot to pack a dll in your installation bundle.  [ 235 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Developing Segmentation Algorithms for Text Recognition  Installing Tesseract on Mac The easiest way to install Tesseract OCR on Mac is using Homebrew. If you don't  have Homebrew installed, just go to the Homebrew site  http:  brew.sh  , open  your console, and run the Ruby script that is on the front page. You may be required  to type your administrator password.  After homebrew is installed, just type the following command:  brew install tesseract  The English language is already included in this installation. If you want to install  other language packs, just run the following command:  brew install tesseract --all-languages  This will install all language packs. Then, just go to the Tesseract installation  directory and delete all unwanted languages. Homebrew usually installs stuff in   usr local .  Using Tesseract OCR library As Tesseract OCR is already integrated with OpenCV 3.0, it still worth studying its  API since it allows a iner-grained control over Tesseract parameters. The integration  will be studied in the next chapter.  Creating a OCR function We'll change the previous example to work with Tesseract. We will start with adding  baseapi and fstream tesseracts to the list:  include   include    include   include    Then, we'll create a global TessBaseAPI object that represents our Tesseract   OCR engine:  tesseract::TessBaseAPI ocr;  [ 236 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10  The ocr engine is completely self-contained. If you want to create  multithreaded OCR software, just add a different TessBaseAPI  object to each thread, and the execution will be fairly thread-safe. You  just need to guarantee that ile writing is not done over the same ile;  otherwise, you'll need to guarantee safety for this operation.  Next, we will create a function called identify text that will run the OCR:  char* identifyText Mat input, char* language = "eng"   {   ocr.Init nULL, language, tesseract::OEM_TESSERACT_OnLY ;   ocr.SetPageSegMode tesseract::PSM_SIngLE_BLOCK ;   ocr.SetImage input.data, input.cols, input.rows, 1,       input.step ;   char* text = ocr.getUTF8Text  ;   cout << "Text:" << endl;   cout << text << endl;   cout << "Confidence: " << ocr.MeanTextConf   << endl << endl;           get the text       return text; }  Let's explain this function line by line. In the irst line, we start initializing Tesseract.  This is done by calling the init function. This function has the following signature:  int Init const char* datapath, const char* language,      OcrEngineMode oem   Let's explain each parameter:     Datapath: This is the path to the tessdata files of the root directory. The   path must end with a backslash   character. The tessdata directory contains  the language files that you installed. Passing nULL to this parameter will  make Tesseract search in its installation directory, which is the location  where this folder is normally present. It's common to change this value to  args[0] when deploying an application and include the tessdata folder in  your application path.  [ 237 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Developing Segmentation Algorithms for Text Recognition     Language: This is a three-letter word with the language code  for example,   eng for English, por for Portuguese, or hin for Hindi . Tesseract supports  loading of multiple language code using the + sign. So, passing eng + por will  load both English and Portuguese. Of course, you can only use languages  that you have previously installed; otherwise, the loading will fail. A  language config file can specify that two or more languages must be loaded  together. To prevent this, you can use a tilde ~. For example, you can use  hin+~eng to guarantee that English is not loaded with Hindi, even if it is  configured to do so.     OcrEngineMode: These are OCR algorithms that will be used. They can have   one of the following values:                  OEM_TESSERACT_OnLY: This uses just Tesseract. It's the fastest  method, but it also has less precision.  OEM_CUBE_OnLY: This uses cube engine. It's slower, but it's more  precise. This will only work if your language was trained to support  this engine mode. To check whether that's the case, look for .cube  files for your language in the tessdata folder. The support for  English is guaranteed.  OEM_TESSERACT_CUBE_COMBInED: This combines both Tesseract and  Cube in order to achieve the best possible OCR classification. This  engine has the best accuracy and the slowest execution time.  OEM_DEFAULT: This tries to infer the strategy based on the language  config file and the command line config file, or in the absence of  both, uses OEM_TESSERACT_OnLY.  It's important to emphasize that the init function can be executed many times. If  a different language or engine mode is provided, Tesseract will clear the previous  coniguration and start again. If the same parameters are provided, Tesseract is smart  enough to simply ignore the command. The init function returns 0 for success and  -1 for failure.  Our program then proceeds by setting the page segmentation mode:  ocr.SetPageSegMode tesseract::PSM_SIngLE_BLOCK ;  There are several segmentation modes available, which are as follows:     PSM_OSD_OnLY: Using this mode, Tesseract just runs its preprocessing   algorithms to detect the orientation and script detection.     PSM_AUTO_OSD: This tells Tesseract to perform automatic page segmentation   with orientation and script detection.  [ 238 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10     PSM_AUTO_OnLY: This does page segmentation, but avoids doing orientation,   script detection, or OCR.     PSM_AUTO: This does page segmentation and OCR, but avoids doing   orientation or script detection.     PSM_SIngLE_COLUMn: This assumes that the text of variable sizes is displayed   in a single column.     PSM_SIngLE_BLOCK_VERT_TEXT: This treats the image as a single uniform   block of a vertically aligned text.     PSM_SIngLE_BLOCK: This is a single block of text. This is the default  configuration. We will use this flag since our preprocessing phase   guarantees this condition.     PSM_SIngLE_LInE: This indicates that the image contains only one line    of text.     PSM_SIngLE_WORD: This indicates that the image contains just one word.    PSM_SIngLE_WORD_CIRCLE: This indicates that the image is just one word   that is disposed in a circle.     PSM_SIngLE_CHAR: This indicates that the image contains a single character.  Notice that Tesseract has already implemented deskewing and text segmentation  algorithms, as most OCR libraries do. But it's interesting to know such algorithms as  you can provide your own preprocessing phase for speciic needs. This allows you  to improve text detection is many cases. For example, if you are creating an OCR  application for old documents, the default threshold used by Tesseract can create a  dark background. Tesseract may also be confused by borders or severe text skewing.  Next, we call the SetImage method with the signature:  void SetImage const unsigned char* imagedata, int width,       int height, int bytes_per_pixel, int bytes_per_line ;  The parameters are almost self-explanatory, and most of them can be read directly  from our mat object:     data: This is a raw byte array that contains the image data. OpenCV    contains a function called data   in the Mat class that provides a direct  pointer to the data.     width: This is the image width.    height: This is the image height.  [ 239 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Developing Segmentation Algorithms for Text Recognition     bytes_per_pixel: This is the number of bytes per pixel. We use 1, since we   are dealing with a binary image. If you want to allow the code to be more  generic, you can also use the Mat::elemSize   function that provides the  same information.     bytes_per_line: This is the number of bytes in a single line. We use the   Mat::step property since some images add trailing bytes.  Then, we call getUTF8Text to run the recognition itself. The recognized text is  returned, encoded with UTF8 without BOM  byte order mark . Before we return it,  we also print some debug information.  The MeanTextConf returns a conidence index, which can be a number from 0 to 100:    char* text = ocr.getUTF8Text  ;   cout << "Text:" << endl;   cout << text << endl;   cout << "Confidence: " << ocr.MeanTextConf   << endl << endl;  Sending the output to a ile Let's change our main method to send the recognized output to a ile. We do this  using a standard ofstream:  int main int argc, char* argv[]  {     Loads the ticket image and binarize it   Mat ticket = binarize imread "ticket.png"  ;   auto regions = findTextAreas ticket ;    std::ofstream file;   file.open "ticket.txt", std::ios::out  std::ios::binary ;      For each region   for  auto region : regions  {       Crop     auto cropped = deskewAndCrop ticket, region ;     char* text = identifyText cropped, "por" ;          file.write text, strlen text  ;     file << endl;   }      file.close  ; }  [ 240 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 10  Notice the following line:  file.open "ticket.txt", std::ios::out  std::ios::binary ;  This opens the ile in binary mode. This is important since Tesseract returns a text  encoded in UTF-8, taking into account the special characters available in Unicode.  We also write the output directly using the following command:  file.write text, strlen text  ;  In this sample, we called identify using Portuguese as the input language  this is  the language in which the ticket was written . You can use another photo, if you like.  The complete source ile is provided in the segmentOcr.cpp ile, which  comes along with this book.  ticket.png is a low resolution image, since we imagined that you  would want to display a window with the image while studying this  code. For this image, Tesseract results are rather poor. If you want  to test it with a higher resolution image, the code is provided with  a ticketHigh.png image. To test this image, change the dilation  repetitions to 12 and the minimum box size from 20 to 60. You'll get  a much higher conidence rate  about 87%  and the resulting text will  be fully readable. The segmentOcrHigh.cpp ile contains these  modiications.  Summary In this chapter, we presented a brief introduction to OCR applications. We saw that  the preprocessing phase of such systems must be adjusted according to the type of  documents that we are planning to identify. We learned the common operations  while preprocessing text iles, such as thresholding, cropping, skewing, and text  region segmentation. Finally, we learned how to install and use Tesseract OCR to  convert our image to text.  In the next chapter, we'll use a more sophisticated OCR technique to identify text in a  casually taken picture or video—a situation known as scene text recognition. This is  a much more complex scenario, since the text can be anywhere, in any font, and with  different illuminations and orientations. There can be no text at all! We'll also learn  how to use the OpenCV 3.0 text contribution module, which is fully integrated   with Tesseract.  [ 241 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Text Recognition   with Tesseract  In the previous chapter, we covered the very basic OCR processing functions.  Although they are quite useful for scanned or photographed documents, they   are almost useless when dealing with text that casually appears in a picture.  In this chapter, we'll explore the OpenCV 3.0 text module, which deals speciically  with scene text detection. Using this API, it is possible to detect text that appears in  a webcam video, or to analyze photographed images  like the ones in Street View or  taken by a surveillance camera  to extract text information in real time. This allows  a wide range of applications to be created, from accessibility to marketing and even  robotics ields.  By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Understand what is scene text recognition    Understand how the text API works    Use the OpenCV 3.0 text API to detect text    Extract the detected text to an image    Use the text API and Tesseract integration to identify letters  How the text API works The text API implements the algorithm proposed by Lukás Neumann and Jiri   Matas in the article called Real-Time Scene Text Localization and Recognition during  the CVPR  Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition  Conference in 2012. This  algorithm represented a signiicant increase in scene text detection, performing the  state-of-the art detection both in the CVPR database as well as in the Google Street  View database.  [ 243 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Text Recognition with Tesseract  Before we use the API, let's take a look at how this algorithm works under the hood,  and how it addresses the scene text detection problem.  Remember that the OpenCV 3.0 text API does not come with the standard  OpenCV modules. It's an additional module present in the OpenCV  contribute package. If you need to install OpenCV using the Windows  Installer, refer to Chapter 1, Getting Started with OpenCV, which will help  you install these modules.  The scene detection problem Detecting text that randomly appears in a scene is a problem harder than it looks.  There are several new variables when we compare them to identify scanned text,  which are as follows:     Tri-dimensionality: The text can be in any scale, orientation, or perspective.   Also, the text can be partially occluded or interrupted. There are literally  thousands of possible regions where it can appear in the image.     Variety: Text can be in several different fonts and colors. The font can   have outline borders or not. The background can be a dark, light, or a  complex image.      Illumination and shadows: The sunlight position and apparent color  changes over the time. Different weather conditions such as fog or rain can  generate noise. Illumination can be a problem even in closed spaces, since  light reflects over colored objects and hits the text.     Blurring: Text can appear in a region that is not prioritized by the auto focus  lenses. Blurring is also common in moving cameras, in perspective text, or in  the presence of fog.  The following image, taken from Google Street View, illustrates these problems.  Notice how several of these situations occur simultaneously in just a single image:  [ 244 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11  Performing a text detection to deal with such situations may prove computationally  expensive, since there are 2n subsets of pixels where the text can be, n being the  number of pixels in the image.  In order to reduce the complexity, two strategies are commonly applied, which are   as follows:     Use a sliding window to search a subset of image rectangles. This strategy   just reduces the number of subsets to a smaller amount. The amount  of regions varies according to the complexity of text being considered.  Algorithms that deal just with text rotation can use small values, as  compared to the ones that also deal with rotation, skewing, perspective,  and so on. The advantage of this approach is its simplicity, but it is usually  limited to a narrow range of fonts, and often, to a lexicon of specific words.     Use of the connected component analysis. This approach assumes that   pixels can be grouped into regions where pixels have similar properties.  These regions are supposed to have higher chances of being identified as  characters. The advantage of this approach is that it does not depend on  several text properties  orientation, scale, and fonts , and they also provide  a segmentation region that can be used to crop text to the OCR. This was the  approach used in the previous chapter.     The OpenCV 3.0 algorithm uses the second one by performing the connected   component analysis and searching for extremal regions.  Extremal regions Extremal regions are connected areas that are characterized by uniform intensity and  surrounded by a contrast background. The stability of a region can be measured by  calculating how resistant the region is to the thresholding variance. This variance can  be measured with a simple algorithm:  1.  Applying the threshold generates an image A. Detect its connected pixel   regions  extremal regions .  2.   Increasing the threshold by a delta amount generates an image B. Detect its  connected pixel regions  extremal regions .  3.  Compare image B with A. If a region in image A is similar to the same   region in image B, then add it to the same branch in the tree. The criteria of  similarity may vary from implementation to implementation, but it's usually  related to the image area or general shape. If a region in image A appears to  be split in image B, create two new branches in the tree for the new regions,  and associate them with the previous branch.  [ 245 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Text Recognition with Tesseract  4.  Set A = B and go back to step 2, until a maximum threshold is applied.  This will assemble a tree of regions, as shown in the following figure:  Image source:  http:  docs.opencv.org master da d56 group__text__detect.htmlgsc.tab=0  The resistance to variance is determined by counting the number of nodes that are in  the same level.  By analyzing this tree, it's also possible to determine the MSERs  Maximally   Stable Extremal Regions , that is, the regions where the area remains stable in a  wide variety of thresholds. In the previous image, it is clear that these areas will  contain the letters O, N, and Y. The main disadvantage of MSERs is that they are  weak in the presence of blur. OpenCV provides a MSER feature detector in the  feature2d module.  Extremal regions are interesting because they are strongly invariant to illumination,  scale, and orientation. They are also good candidates for text because they are also  invariant of the type of font used, even when the font is styled. Each region can also  be analyzed in order to determine its boundary ellipsis and have properties, such as  afine transformation and area that can be numerically determined. Finally, it's worth  mentioning that this entire process is fast, which makes it a very good candidate for  real-time applications.  Extremal region iltering Although MSERs are a common approach to deine which extremal regions are  worth working with, the Neumann and Matas algorithm uses a different approach  by submitting all extremal regions to a sequential classiier that is trained for  character detection. This classiier works in the following two different stages:     The first stage incrementally computes descriptors  the bounding box,   perimeter, area, and Euler number  for each region. These descriptors are  submitted to a classifier that estimates how probable the region is for it to  be a character in the alphabet. Then, only the regions of high probability are  selected to stage 2.  [ 246 ]  www.it-ebooks.info       In this stage, the features of the whole area ratio, convex hull ratio, and the  number of outer boundary inflexion points are calculated. This provides  a more detailed information that allows the classifier to discard nontext  characters, but they are also much slower to calculate.  Chapter 11  In OpenCV, this process is implemented in an ERFilter class. It is also possible  to use different image single-channel projections such as R, G, B, luminance, or  grayscale conversion to increase the character recognition rates.  Finally, all the characters must be grouped in text blocks  such as words or  paragraphs . OpenCV 3.0 provides two algorithms for this purpose:     Prune Exhaustive Search: This was also proposed by Mattas in 2011.   This algorithm does not need any previous training or classification,   but is limited to a horizontally aligned text.     Hierarchical Method for Oriented Text: This deals with texts in any   orientation, but needs a trained classifier.  Since these operations require classiiers, it is also necessary to  provide a trained set as an input. OpenCV3.0 provides some of  these trained sets in the sample package. This also means that  this algorithm is sensitive to the fonts used in classiier training.  A demonstration of this algorithm can be seen in the video provided by Neumann at  https:  youtu.be ejd5ggea2Fo.  Once the text is segmented, it just needs to be sent to an OCR, such as Tesseract,  similar to what we did in the previous chapter. The only difference is that now we  will use OpenCV text module classes to interact with Tesseract, since they provide a  way to encapsulate the speciic OCR engine we are using.  Using the text API Enough of theory. It's time to see how the text module works in practice. Let's study  how to use it to perform text detection, extraction, and identiication.  Text detection Let's start with creating a simple program to perform text segmentation using  ERFilters. In this program, we will use the trained classiiers from text API  samples. You can download them from the OpenCV repository, but they are also  available in the book's companion code.  [ 247 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Text Recognition with Tesseract  First, we start with including all the necessary libs and using:  include  "opencv2 highgui.hpp" include  "opencv2 imgproc.hpp" include  "opencv2 text.hpp"  include    include     using namespace std; using namespace cv; using namespace cv::text;  Recall from our previous section that the ERFilter works separately in each image  channel. So, we must provide a way to separate each desired channel in a different  single cv::Mat channel. This is done by the separateChannels function:  vector  separateChannels Mat& src  {   vector  channels;     grayscale images   if  src.type   == CV_8U  src.type   == CV_8UC1  {     channels.push_back src ;     channels.push_back 255-src ;     return channels;   }      Colored images   if  src.type   == CV_8UC3  {     computenMChannels src, channels ;     int size = static_cast  channels.size   -1;     for  int c = 0; c < size; c++        channels.push_back 255-channels[c] ;     return channels;   }      Other types   cout << "Invalid image format!" << endl;   exit -1 ; }  [ 248 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11  First, we verify that the image is a single channel image  for example, a grayscale  image . If that's the case, we just add this image and its negative to be processed.  Otherwise, we check whether it's an RGB image. For colored images, we call the  computenMChannels to split the image in its several channels. The function is  deined as follows:  void computenMChannels InputArray src, OutputArrayOfArrays channels,  int mode = ERFILTER_nM_RgBLgrad ;  Its parameters are described as follows:     src: This is the source input array. It should be a colored image of       channels: This is a vector of mats that will be filled with the    type 8UC3.  resulting channels.     mode: This defines the channels that will be computed. There are two possible   values that can be used, which are as follows:     ERFILTER_nM_RgBLgrad: This indicates that the algorithm uses an RGB color,   lightness, and gradient magnitude as channels  default .     ERFILTER_nM_IHSgrad: This indicates that the image will be split by its   intensity, hue, saturation, and gradient magnitude.  We also append the negatives of all color components in the vector. Finally, if   another kind of image is provided, the function will terminate the program   with an error message.  Negatives are appended so the algorithms will cover both bright text on a  dark background and dark text on a bright background. There is no point  in adding a negative to the gradient magnitude.  [ 249 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Text Recognition with Tesseract  Let's proceed to the main method. We'll use the program to segment the easel.png  image, which is provided with the source code:  This image was taken by a mobile phone camera, while I was walking on the street.  Let's code so that you can also use a different image easily by providing its name in  the irst program argument:  int main int argc, const char * argv[]  {   char* image = argc < 2 ? "easel.png" : argv[1];    auto input = imread image ;  Next, we'll convert the image to grayscale and separate its channels by calling the  separateChannels function:    Mat processed;   cvtColor input, processed, CV_RgB2gRAY ;  auto channels = separateChannels processed ;  If you want to work with all the channels in a colored image, just replace the irst two  lines of the preceding code with the following code:  Mat processed = input;  [ 250 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11  We will need to analyze six channels  RGB + inverted  instead of two  gray  + inverted . Actually the processing time will increase much more than the  improvements that we can get.With the channels in hand, we need to create  ERFilters for both the stages of the algorithm. Luckily, the opencv text  contribution module provides functions for this:     Create ERFilter objects with the 1st and 2nd stage classifiers auto filter1 = createERFilternM1       loadClassifiernM1 "trained_classifiernM1.xml" ,  15, 0.00015f,         0.13f, 0.2f,true,0.1f ;  auto filter2 = createERFilternM2      loadClassifiernM2 "trained_classifiernM2.xml" ,0.5 ;  For the irst stage, we call the loadClassifiernM1 function to load a previously  trained classiication model. The XML containing the training data is its only  argument. Then, we call createERFilternM1 to create an instance of the ERFilter  class that will perform the classiication. The function has the following signature:  Ptr  createERFilternM1 const Ptr & cb,     int thresholdDelta = 1,      float minArea = 0.00025, float maxArea = 0.13,      float minProbability = 0.4, bool nonMaxSuppression = true,       float minProbabilityDiff = 0.1 ;  The parameters are described as follows:     cb: This is the classification model. This is the same model that we loaded   with the loadCassifiernM1 function.     thresholdDelta: This is the amount to be added to the threshold in each  algorithm iteration. The default value is 1, but we'll use 15 in our example.    minArea: This is the minimum area of the ER where text can be found. This   is measured in % of the image size. ERs with areas smaller than this are  immediately discarded.     maxArea: This is the maximum area of the ER where text can be found. This  is also measured in % of the image size. ERs with areas greater than this are  immediately discarded.     minProbability: This is the minimum probability that a region must have to   be a character in order to remain for the next stage.  [ 251 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Text Recognition with Tesseract     nonMaxSupression: This indicates that non-maximum suppression will be   done in each branch probability.     minProbabilityDiff: This is the minimum probability difference between   the minimum and maximum extreme region.  The process for the second stage is similar. We call loadClassifiernM2 to load  the classiier model for the second stage and createERFilternM2 to create the  second stage classiier. This function only takes the loaded classiication model and  a minimum probability that a region must achieve to be considered a character as  input parameters.  So, let's call these algorithms in each channel to identify all possible text regions:    Extract text regions using newmann & Matas algorithm cout << "Processing " << channels.size   << " channels..."; cout << endl; vector  > regions channels.size   ; for  int c=0; c < channels.size  ; c++  {     cout << "    Channel " <<  c+1  << endl;     filter1->run channels[c], regions[c] ;     filter2->run channels[c], regions[c] ; }     filter1.release  ; filter2.release  ;  In the previous code, we used the run function of the ERFilter class. This function  takes the following two arguments:     The input channel: This is the image to be processed.    The regions: In the first stage algorithm, this argument will be filled with the  detected regions. In the second stage  performed by filter2 , this argument  must contain the regions selected in stage 1, which will be processed and  filtered by stage 2.  Finally, we release both the ilters, since they will not be needed anymore in   the program.  The inal segmentation step is to group all ERRegions into possible words and deine  their bounding boxes. This is done by calling the ergrouping function:    Separate character groups from regions vector  > groups; vector  groupRects; ergrouping input, channels, regions, groups, groupRects, ERgROUPIng_ ORIEnTATIOn_HORIZ ;  [ 252 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11  This function has the following signature:  void ergrouping InputArray img, InputArrayOfArrays channels,     std::vector  > &regions,     std::vector  > &groups,     std::vector  &groups_rects,     int method = ERgROUPIng_ORIEnTATIOn_HORIZ,     const std::string& filename = std::string  ,     float minProbablity = 0.5 ;  Let's take a look at the deinition of each parameter:     img: This is the original input image. You can refer to the    following observations.     regions: This is a vector of single-channel images where regions    are extracted.     groups: This is an output vector of indexes of grouped regions. Each group   region contains all extremal regions of a single word.     groupRects: This is a list of rectangles with the detected text regions.    method: This is a method of grouping. It can be as follows:                  ERgROUPIng_ORIEnTATIOn_HORIZ: This is the default value. This  only generates groups with horizontally oriented text by performing  an exhaustive search, as proposed originally by Neumann and Matas.  ERgROUPIng_ORIEnTATIOn_AnY: This generates groups with text in  any orientation, using Single Linkage Clustering and classifiers.  If you use this method, the filename of the classifier model must be  provided in the next parameter.  Filename: This is the name of the classifier model. It is only needed if  ERgROUPIng_ORIEnTATIOn_AnY is selected.  minProbability: This is the minimum detected probability of  accepting a group. Also, it is only needed if the ERgROUPIng_ ORIEnTATIOn_AnY is used.  The code also provides a call to the second method, but it's commented. You can  switch between the two to test it. Just comment the previous call and uncomment  this one:  ergrouping input, channels, regions,      groups, groupRects, ERgROUPIng_ORIEnTATIOn_AnY,      "trained_classifier_ergrouping.xml", 0.5 ;  [ 253 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Text Recognition with Tesseract  For this call, we also used the default trained classiier provided in the text module  sample package.  Finally, we draw the region boxes and show the results:     draw groups boxes for  auto rect : groupRects      rectangle input, rect, Scalar 0, 255, 0 , 3 ; imshow "grouping",input ; waitKey 0 ;  The output of the program is shown in the following image:  You can check the complete source code in the detection.cpp ile.  [ 254 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11  While most OpenCV text module functions are written to support both  grayscale and colored images as their input parameters, by the time  this book was written, there were bugs that prevented using grayscale  images in functions, such as erGrouping; for instance. Refer to https:   github.com Itseez opencv_contrib issues 309. Always remember that the OpenCV contribute modules package is not as  stable as the default opencv packages.  Text extraction Now that we detected the regions, we must crop the text before we submit it to the  OCR. We can simply use a function such as getRectSubpix or Mat::copy using  each region rectangle as a ROI  region of interest , but since the letters are skewed,  some undesired text may be cropped as well; for instance, this is what one of the  regions will look like if we just extract the ROI based in its given rectangle:  Fortunately, the ERFilter provides us with an object called ERStat, which contains  pixels inside each extremal region. With these pixels, we can use the OpenCV  floodFill function to reconstruct each letter. This function is capable of painting  similar colored pixels based in a seed point, just like the bucket tool of most drawing  applications. This is what the function signature looks like:  int floodFill InputOutputArray image, InputOutputArray mask,     Point seedPoint, Scalar newVal,       CV_OUT Rect* rect=0,     Scalar loDiff = Scalar  , Scalar upDiff = Scalar  ,     int flags = 4  ;  Let's understand these parameters and see how they can be used:     image: This is the input image. We'll use the channel image where the   extremal region was taken. This is where the function normally does the  flood fill, unless the FLOODFILL_MASK_OnLY is supplied. In this case, the  image remains untouched and the drawing occurs in the mask. That's exactly  what we will do.  [ 255 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Text Recognition with Tesseract     mask: The mask must be an image two rows and columns greater than the   input image. When flood fill draws a pixel, it verifies that the corresponding  pixel in the mask is zero. In that case, it will draw and mark this pixel as one   or the other value passed in the flags . If the pixel is not zero, flood fill does  not paint the pixel. In our case, we'll provide a blank mask, so every letter  will get painted in the mask.     seedPoint: This is the starting point. It's similar to the place where you click   when you want to use the "bucket" tool of a graphic application.     newVal: This is the new value of the repainted pixels.    loDiff and upDiff: These parameters represent the lower and upper  difference between the pixels being processed and their neighbors. The  neighbor will be painted if it falls in this range. If the FLOODFILL_FIXED_ RAngE flag is used, the difference between the seed point and the pixels being  processed will be used instead.     rect: This is the optional parameter that limits the region where the flood fill   will be applied.     flags: This value is represented by a bit mask.              The least significant eight bits of the flag contain a connectivity value.  A value of 4 indicates that all the four edge pixels will be used, and a  value of 8 will indicates that diagonal pixels must also be taken into  account. We'll use four for this parameter.  The next 8 to 16 bits contain a value from 1 to 255 and are used to fill  the mask. Since we want to fill the mask with white, we'll use 255 <<  8 for this value.  There are two more bits that can be set by adding the FLOODFILL_ FIXED_RAngE and FLOODFILL_MASK_OnLY flags, as described earlier.  We'll create a function called drawER. This function will receive four parameters:     A vector with all processed channels    The ERStat regions    The group that must be drawn    The group rectangle  [ 256 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11  This function will return an image with the word represented by this group. Let's  start with this function by creating the mask image and deining the lags:  Mat out = Mat::zeros channels[0].rows+2, channels[0].cols+2, CV_8UC1 ; int flags = 4                        4 neighbors   +  255 << 8                       paint mask in white  255    + FLOODFILL_FIXED_RAngE           fixed range   + FLOODFILL_MASK_OnLY;            Paint just the mask  Then, we'll loop though each group. It's necessary to ind the region index and its  stats. There's a chance that this extreme region will be the root, which does not  contain any points. In this case, we'll just ignore it:  for  int g=0; g < group.size  ; g++  { int idx = group[g][0];    ERStat er = regions[idx][group[g][1]];   Ignore root region    if  er.parent == nULL       continue;  Now, we can read the pixel coordinate from the ERStat object. It's represented by  the pixel number, counting from top to bottom, left to right. This linear index must  be converted to a row  y  and column  z  notation, using a formula similar to the one  that we discussed in Chapter 2, An Introduction to the Basics of OpenCV:  int px = er.pixel % channels[idx].cols; int py = er.pixel   channels[idx].cols; Point p px, py ;  Then, we can call the floodFill function. The ERStat object gives us the value that  we need to use in the loDiff parameter:  floodFill      channels[idx], out,            Image and mask     p, Scalar 255 ,                Seed and color     nullptr,                        no rect     Scalar er.level ,Scalar 0 ,      LoDiff and upDiff     flags                            Flags  [ 257 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Text Recognition with Tesseract  After we do this for all regions in the group, we'll end it with an image a little bigger  than the original one, with a black background and the word in white letters. Now,  let's crop just the area of the letters. Since the region rectangle was given, we start  with deining it as our region of interest:  out = out rect ;  Then, we'll ind all nonzero pixels. This is the value that we'll use in the minAreaRect  function to get the rotated rectangle around the letters. Finally, we borrow the  previous chapter's deskewAndCrop function to crop and rotate the image for us:    vector  points;   findnonZero out, points ;     Use deskew and crop to crop it perfectly   return deskewAndCrop out, minAreaRect points  ; }  This is the result of the process for the easel image:  Text recognition In Chapter 10, Developing Segmentation Algorithms for Text Recognition, we used the  Tesseract API directly to recognize the text regions. This time, we'll use OpenCV  classes to accomplish the same goal.  In OpenCV, all OCR-speciic classes are derived from the BaseOCR virtual class.   This class provides a common interface for the OCR execution method itself.  Speciic implementations must inherit from this class. By default, the text module  provides three different implementations: OCRTesseract, OCRHMMDecoder, and  OCRBeamSearchDecoder.  [ 258 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   This hierarchy is depicted in the following class diagram:  BaseOCR  Chapter 11  OCRTesseract  OCRHMMDecoder  OCRBeamSearchDecoder  With this approach, we can separate the part of the code where the OCR mechanism  is created from the execution itself. This makes it easier to change the OCR  implementation in the future.  So, let's start with creating a method that decides which implementation we'll   use based on a string. We will currently support Tesseract. However, you can  take a look at the chapter code where a demonstration with HMMDecoder is also  provided. We are also accepting the OCR engine name in a string parameter, but we  can improve our application lexibility by reading it from an external jSOn or XML  coniguration ile:  cv::Ptr  initOCR2 const string& ocr   {   if  ocr == "tesseract"  {     return OCRTesseract::create nullptr, "eng+por" ;   }   throw string "Invalid OCR engine: "  + ocr; }  You may notice that the function returns a Ptr . Now, take a look at the  highlighted code. It calls the create method to initialize a Tesseract OCR instance.  Let's take a look at its oficial signature, since it allows several speciic parameters:  Ptr  create const char* datapath=NULL,       const char* language=NULL,       const char* char_whitelist=NULL,       int oem=3, int psmode=3 ;  Let's dissect each one of these parameters:     datapath: This is the path to the tessdata files of the root directory. The   path must end with a backslash   character. The tessdata directory contains  the language files you installed. Passing nullptr to this parameter will make  Tesseract search in its installation directory, which is the location where  this folder is normally present. It's common to change this value to args[0]  when deploying an application and include the tessdata folder in your  application path.  [ 259 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Text Recognition with Tesseract     language: This is a three letter word with the language code  for example,  eng for English, por for Portuguese, or hin for Hindi . Tesseract supports  loading of multiple language codes using the + sign. So, passing eng+por will  load both English and Portuguese languages. Of course, you can only use  languages that you previously installed; otherwise, the loading will fail. A  language configuration file can specify that two or more languages must be  loaded together. To prevent this, you can use a tilde ~. For example, you can  use hin+~eng to guarantee that English is not loaded with Hindi, even if it is  configured to do so.     whitelist: This is the character set to be considered for  recognition. If nullptr is passed, the characters will be  0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFgHIjKLMnOPQRSTUVWXYZ.     oem: These are OCR algorithms that will be used. They can have one of the   following values:     psmode: This is the segmentation mode. The modes are as follows:                                      OEM_TESSERACT_OnLY: This uses just Tesseract. It's the fastest  method, but it also has less precision.  OEM_CUBE_OnLY: This uses the cube engine. It's slower, but more  precise. This will only work if your language was trained to support  this engine mode. To check whether that's the case, look for .cube  files for your language in the tessdata folder. The support for  English language is guaranteed.  OEM_TESSERACT_CUBE_COMBInED: This combines both Tesseract and  cube to achieve the best possible OCR classification. This engine has  the best accuracy and the slowest execution time.  OEM_DEFAULT: This tries to infer the strategy based in the language  config file, command line config file, or in the absence of both, uses  OEM_TESSERACT_OnLY.  PSM_OSD_OnLY: Using this mode, Tesseract will just run its  preprocessing algorithms to detect orientation and script detection.  PSM_AUTO_OSD: This tells Tesseract to do automatic page  segmentation with orientation and script detection.  PSM_AUTO_OnLY: This does page segmentation, but avoids doing  orientation, script detection, or OCR. This is the default value.  PSM_AUTO: This does page segmentation and OCR, but avoids doing  orientation or script detection.  PSM_SIngLE_COLUMn: This assumes that the text of variable sizes is  displayed in a single column.  [ 260 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Chapter 11                          PSM_SIngLE_BLOCK_VERT_TEXT: This treats the image as a single  uniform block of a vertically aligned text.  PSM_SIngLE_BLOCK: This is a single block of text. This is the default  configuration. We will use this flag since our preprocessing phase  guarantees this condition.  PSM_SIngLE_LInE: This indicates that the image contains only one  line of text.  PSM_SIngLE_WORD: This indicates that the image contains just one  word.  PSM_SIngLE_WORD_CIRCLE: This informs that the image is a just one  word disposed in a circle.  PSM_SIngLE_CHAR: This indicates that the image contains a single  character.  For the last two parameters, the include tesseract directory recommends you to  use the constant names instead of directly inserting their values.  The last step is to add text detection to our main function. To do this, just add the  following code to the end of the main method:  auto ocr = initOCR "tesseract" ; for  int i = 0; i < groups.size  ; i++  {   Mat wordImage = drawER channels, regions, groups[i],       groupRects[i] ;   string word;   ocr->run wordImage, word ;   cout << word << endl; }  In this code, we started by calling our initOCR method to create a Tesseract instance.  Notice that the remaining code will not change if we choose a different OCR engine,  since the run method signature is guaranteed by the BaseOCR class.  Next, we iterate over each detected ERFilter group. Since each group represents a  different word, we:     Call the previously created drawER function to create an image with    the word.     Create a text string called word, and call the run function to recognize the   word image. The recognized word will be stored in the string.     Print the text string on the screen.  [ 261 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Text Recognition with Tesseract  Let's take a look at the run method signature. This method is deined in the BaseOCR  class and will be equal for all speciic OCR implementations, even the ones that  might be implemented in the future:  virtual void run Mat& image, std::string& output_text,        std::vector * component_rects=nULL,        std::vector * component_texts=nULL,        std::vector * component_confidences=nULL,      int component_level=0  = 0;  Of course, this is a pure virtual function that must be implemented by each speciic  class  such as the OCRTesseract class that we just used :     image: This is the input image. It must be an RGB or a grayscale image    component_rects: We can provide a vector to be filled with the bounding   box of each component  words or text lines  detected by the OCR engine     component_texts: If given, this vector will be filled with the text strings of   each component detected by the OCR     component_confidences: If given, the vector will be filled with floats and   the confidence values of each component     component_level: This defines what a component is. It may have the OCR_  LEVEL_WORD  by default  or OCR_LEVEL_TEXT_LInE values  If necessary, we prefer changing the component level to a word or line  in the run   method instead of doing the same thing in the psmode  parameter of the create   function. This is preferable since the run  method will be supported by any OCR engine that decides to implement  the BaseOCR class. Always remember that the create   method is  where vendor speciic conigurations are set.  This is the program's inal output:  [ 262 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Despite a minor confusion with the & symbol, every word was perfectly recognized!  You can check the complete source code in the ocr.cpp ile, in the chapter code.  Chapter 11  Summary In this chapter, we saw that scene text recognition is a far more dificult OCR  situation than working with scanned texts. We studied how the text module  addresses this problem with extremal region identiication using the Newmann and  Matas algorithm. We also saw how to use this API with the floodfill function to  extract the text to an image and submit it to Tesseract OCR. Finally, we studied how  the OpenCV text module integrates with Tesseract and other OCR engines, and how  we can use its classes to identify what's written in the image.  This ends our journey with OpenCV. From the beginning to the end of this book,  we expected you to have a glance about the Computer Vision area and have a  better understanding of how several applications work. We also sought to show  you that, although OpenCV is quite an impressive library, the ield is already full of  opportunities for improvement and research.  Thank you for reading! No matter whether you use OpenCV for creating impressive  commercial programs based on Computer Vision, or if you use it in a research that  will change the world, we hope you will ind this content useful.
