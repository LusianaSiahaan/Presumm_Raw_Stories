Fadi Al-Turjman   Preface  We are living in an era where the Artiﬁcial Intelligence  AI  is becoming a global platform for the computation and interaction between machines and smart objects in real-time applications and many critical aspects in our daily life.  With the application areas such as smart cities, smart grids, smart water manage- ments, smart health, smart supply chain, and smart homes in the Internet of Things  IoT , we can consider the AI as a complementary package of the smart networked objects. From this perspective, it is essential to understand the role of AI which will provide a global backbone for the worldwide information sharing processing in the near future.  No doubt that introducing such a new phenomenon can come with potential chal- lenges in signiﬁcant levels, especially in terms of the overall system complexity and ability in solving critical daily life issues. Therefore, it is also essential to consider new enabling technologies such as wireless sensor networks  WSNs , various radio technologies, and cellular infrastructures for the performance optimization.  The objective of this book is to present a survey of existing AI techniques and other emerging intelligent approaches for the IoT paradigm optimization and improvements. The main focus is on the smart design aspects that can help in realizing such a paradigm in an efﬁcient and secured way. The applications of AI in IoT, evaluation metrics, constraints, and open issues about the addressed topics are included for discussion as well. This conceptual book, which is unique in the ﬁeld, will assist researchers and professionals working in the area of AI to better assess the proposed IoT paradigms which are already beginning to be a signiﬁcant part of the global infrastructure on the planet.

Azuma says “In contrast, AR allows the user to see the real world, with virtual objects superimposed upon or composited with the real world” [7]  emphasis added . Typically, a user wears a tracked stereoscopic head-mounted display  HMD  or holds a smartphone, showing the real world through optical or video means, with superimposed graphics that provide the appearance of virtual content that is related to and registered with the real world. While AR has been around since the 1960s [72], it is experiencing a renaissance of development and consumer interest. With exciting products from Microsoft  HoloLens , Metavision  Meta 2 , and others; Apple’s AR Developer’s Kit  ARKit ; and well-funded startups like Magic Leap [54], the future is looking even brighter, expecting that AR technologies will be absorbed into our daily lives and have a strong inﬂuence on our society in the foreseeable future.  At the same time, we are seeing the continued evolution of intelligent virtual agents  IVAs  in the home through products such as Apple’s Home Pod, Amazon’s Echo, and Google Home. Gartner predicted that the IVA market will reach $2.1 billion by 2020 [58]. The products use sophisticated microphones and signal  N. Norouzi   cid:2   · G. Bruder · B. Belna · D. Turgut · G.

Products like the Gatebox [27], a Japanese take on Amazon’s Echo with a holographic display, even provide an embodied representation of the IVA for users to interact with. Various research prototypes in the ﬁeld of IVA used projectors and TV screens to study natural interaction with embodied virtual agents in the past. While research on IVAs started as an independent trend from AR, we are now seeing that over the last years, more and more technologies and techniques from AR are used for IVA research and commercial developments and vice versa.  The abilities of these products further extend to home automation and more general interactions with the increasingly present Internet of things  IoT  [1], i.e., a network of sensors and actuators within or attached to real-world objects. The term was coined by Kevin Ashton [5], who at MIT’s AutoID lab in the early 2000s was laying the groundwork for what would become IoT. Cisco’s IoT Group predicts there will be over 500 billion connected devices by 2030 [79]. Amazon and other companies networked their IVA devices to IoT and related smart home appliances and found an important application ﬁeld for IVAs, resulting in a novel research thrust and mutually beneﬁcial overlap between these ﬁelds. Many of the research topics pursued in the IoT ﬁeld, such as privacy [56, 73], the relationship between edge and cloud processing [15], and network trafﬁc optimization [2], will need to be re-evaluated when IoT is deployed in the context of AR and IVA. Furthermore, some IoT applications, such as smart healthcare [3, 77], can beneﬁt from the addition of AR and IVA techniques.  Research in the three ﬁelds AR, IVA, and IoT has led to a large body of literature, and active research communities that traditionally received limited input from each other, advancing knowledge and developing novel technologies and systems within each ﬁeld individually  see Fig. 1 . However, over the last decades, we have seen an increasing integration of knowledge, technologies, and methods from  Fig. 1 Venn diagram illustrating the convergence of augmented reality, intelligent virtual agents, and the Internet of things   A Systematic Review of the Convergence of Augmented Reality, Intelligent. . .  3  the three ﬁelds that act as frameworks to catalyze new research and development. The National Science Foundation  NSF  acknowledged the importance of such a convergence of research ﬁelds as one of the 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments [30]. According to NSF, “convergence research” is closely related to transdisciplinary research, which is generally viewed as the pinnacle of evolutionary integration across disciplines. However, convergence research represents more than transdisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and multidisciplinary research in that the ﬁelds not only overlap and integrate but come together to establish a new ﬁeld with new directions for research that can attract and draw from deep integration of researchers from different disciplines, leveraging their collective strengths, with the hope of solving new or vexing research challenges and opportunities.  In this chapter, we present a review of 187 publications scattered throughout scientiﬁc conferences and workshops in diverse research communities over the last decades at the intersections of each two of the three ﬁelds AR, IVA, and IoT. We identiﬁed impactful research papers and directions for research in these ﬁelds, and we discuss a vision for the nexus of all three technologies. We highlight key themes and identify possible future research topics and trends. Overall, providing a review that introduces a substantial and useful perspective, focusing on the era of convergence research in these areas is the main goal. We hope that this paper can beneﬁt new researchers and students involved in academia by providing a summary of the current advances and trends in these research areas and help them identify their research interests. We also hope that it will be helpful for senior researchers to see a big picture of AR, IVA, and IoT research trends, particularly with respect to a future vision of AR that may have a positive inﬂuence on humans and our society. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. We ﬁrst describe our review methodology in Sect. 2. Then, we present a high-level description of our considered review topics in Sect. 3, which is followed by a meta-review of publications on AR, IVA, and IoT in Sect. 4. We then present a review of existing convergent research on AR and IVA, IVA and IoT, and AR and IoT in Sects. 5, 6, and 7, respectively, and we discuss trends that were observed from our reviews. In Sect. 8, we discuss a novel vision for future research that we see at the nexus of IVA, IoT, and AR. We conclude the paper in Sect. 9.  2 Methodology  For our literature review, we were faced with the challenge that papers published at the intersections of AR, IVA, and IoT could be published in a wide range of research communities with their own journals, conferences, and workshops. We could further not rely on an established terminology that would describe the convergence research and could guide our literature search. We decided on the following two-tailed literature search strategy to locate relevant publications:   4  N. Norouzi et al.  1. We conducted a computerized search for publications in the online digital libraries of the Association for Computing Machinery  ACM , Institute of Elec- trical and Electronics Engineers  IEEE , Eurographics, Elsevier, and Google Scholar databases. Searches were conducted using a 132-item list of relevant terms, such as “augmented reality,” “mixed reality,” the “Internet of things,” “smart home,” etc. with each requiring combinations of two of these terms to identify publications in the intersections of the respective ﬁelds. The terms in each area were searched in the title, abstract, and keyword ﬁelds of the above libraries if available.  2. We searched the reference lists of located relevant publications for further  relevant literature.  The abstract and body of each located publication was examined, and each was  selected for further analysis if and only if it matched all of the following criteria:  1. The publication was peer reviewed and published at a scientiﬁc journal, confer- ence, and workshop or as a book chapter. Technical reports, posters, and demos were not considered since they are usually shorter and or not normally reviewed as rigorously.  2. The publication was at least four pages long. Shorter publications were excluded to limit the search to mature research and avoid position papers and work in progress.  3. The publication was released in the new millennium, i.e., in the year 2000 or  later, to limit the scope of the literature review to a tractable period.  4. We consider certain related topics as outside of the scope of this literature  review:   a  We excluded publications on intelligent agent software algorithms that had neither a 2D 3D virtual representation nor a voice-based natural user interface.  devices, if they were not connected to the Internet.   b  We excluded agents with physical manifestations as robotic humans.  c  We excluded VR and “augmented virtuality” display environments [57].  d  We excluded wearable devices like smart fabrics, wrist, belt, or foot-worn From now on we use the mathematical intersection operator, e.g., AR ∩ IVA, to indicate the set of publications that include both AR and IVA concepts and satisﬁed the above criteria, i.e., publications at the intersection of the respective ﬁelds. The above procedures resulted in a sample of 187 publications in total between the years 2000 and 2018 for the ﬁelds AR ∩ IVA  65 publications , IVA ∩ IoT  43 publications , and AR ∩ IoT  79 publications . Of course, we do not make any claims that this list of publications covers the entirety of research in the identiﬁed converging ﬁelds, but we hope that the analysis and review of the located publications can provide an excellent snapshot of the work listed at these premier tools for disseminating academic research.   A Systematic Review of the Convergence of Augmented Reality, Intelligent. . .  5  The second part of the review process focused on the following points:  1. We divided the total number of publications among the ﬁrst four authors and classiﬁed all publications based on their research contributions using the research topics described below.  2. We collected the citation counts for all publications on August 19, 2018. Due to the different sources of the publications, we decided to collect citation counts from Google Citation Index, which covered the largest portion of the publications compared to Scopus and other databases. If we could not ﬁnd a citation count for a speciﬁc publication on any of the databases, we set it to zero for the analysis.  3. We divided the publications among the ﬁrst four authors based on their expertise and performed in-depth reviews of the most highly cited publications in the converging ﬁelds. If publications were released recently  in 2017 or later , we did not entirely rely on the citation counts as a measure of impact but included a quick ﬁrst review of the publications before performing an in-depth review. We considered analyzing further metrics of the impact of these publications, but honors and awards such as Best Paper or Honorable Mention Awards proved intractable for our diverse set of publications.  During the review process, we focused on identifying and reviewing those publications that had a high impact on the convergence of the ﬁelds, novel trends, and directions that stemmed from those publications, as well as challenges that were encountered.  3 Review Topics  During the literature search process, we identiﬁed groups of publications related to different research topics that guided our analysis process. We reﬁned our list of topics based on related literature surveys, including [22, 41, 59]. We reﬁned or removed topics from that list based on the number of related publications in our literature search. In the end, we decided to group all publications into seven research topics, ranging from core technology areas needed to deliver an AR, IVA, or IoT application to emerging research ﬁelds. Publications may belong to one or more of these topic categories.  The research topic categories are:  1. System: research on systems covering at least in part two of the three areas AR,  2. Application: research on systems in application domains such as manufacturing,  healthcare, and defense, among others  3. Evaluation: research focusing on human-subject studies evaluating systems or  4. Review Survey: literature reviews including at least in part two of the considered  5. Multimodal: research into combined modalities such as speech and gesture  IVA, and IoT  techniques  convergence areas  interfaces   6  N. Norouzi et al.  6. Collaboration: research on interactive collaborative systems for multiple users 7. Interaction: research on user interfaces or interaction techniques  We further aimed to understand the input and output modalities of these systems at the intersections of AR, IVA, and IoT in more detail. We hence decided to classify all publications based on two general concepts related to the information transfer between the real physical world and the virtual computer-controlled content during interactions:  Input: The “virtual” is aware of something “real.”      Output: The “virtual” is inﬂuencing something “real.”  We considered the input and output dimensions for different human sensory and related modalities: light, sound, touch, motion, temperature, ﬂuid, smell, and airﬂow. Most of the publications addressed light or sound output  e.g., visual or auditory displays in AR , some considered light or motion input  e.g., camera- based user tracking in AR  and sound input  e.g., voice-controlled agents , and some considered physical output  e.g., exerting inﬂuence over smart homes with IoT . For each paper we also looked at the types of displays used for the AR content and the IVAs. The displays considered are HMDs, mobile devices  e.g., cell phones, tablets , screens  ﬂat screens, TVs , and other less often occurring types of displays that we grouped together such as projection-based AR and CAVE environments. We used the tag N A for publications where a display type was not indicated as part of their work, and we also categorized publications that developed setups that are migratable to multiple different displays as cross-display.  4 Meta-Review of Publications  In this section, we describe a high-level meta-review analysis of the number of publications and citations for each convergence ﬁeld and research category. As stated above, we considered a total of seven research topics that we want to discuss in this chapter. First, we evaluated the number of publications for each convergence ﬁeld over time  see Fig. 2 . Then, we evaluated them for each research category and their percentage over the total number of classiﬁcations  see Fig. 3 . Publications could cover multiple topics; thus, this classiﬁcation count is larger than the number of publications—338 classiﬁcations among 187 publications. As shown in Fig. 2, research in the ﬁeld of AR ∩ IVA goes further back compared to the other two ﬁelds, which is understandable considering that IoT is a comparatively more recent area of research. Also, in line with the technological advances in the ﬁeld of IoT in the past few years  e.g., Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana, and the Google Assistant , we observe a signiﬁcant increase in the number of publications in both of the ﬁelds converging with IoT. Interestingly, the drop in the number of publications in 2009 and 2010 coincides with a rise in publications in the ﬁelds of AR ∩ IoT and IVA ∩ IoT.   A Systematic Review of the Convergence of Augmented Reality, Intelligent. . .  7  Fig. 2 Number of publications in the convergence ﬁelds from the year 2000  Fig. 3 Number of publications in each convergence ﬁeld grouped according to classiﬁcation topics  Looking at the distribution of classiﬁcation topics for each ﬁeld in Fig. 3, excluding review and survey papers, we observe a lower number of publications in the remaining topics for the ﬁeld of IVA ∩ IoT, which is partly due to our exclusion criteria 4 in Sect. 2 and the novelty of this topic. Also, with research in the ﬁeld of AR and IVA being more developed than IoT, we observe fewer system papers in AR ∩ IVA compared to AR ∩ IoT and more research involving user studies. Interestingly, even though the research in the ﬁelds of AR and IVA goes back further than IoT, we see a similar number of application papers in AR ∩ IVA compared to AR ∩ IoT, which in part may be due to the sudden growth in using   8  N. Norouzi et al.  Fig. 4 Number of publications in each convergence ﬁeld grouped by display type  IoT devices in one form or another by the general public unlike AR ∩ IVA, due to high price or technical difﬁculties of developing and interacting with holograms. Looking at the type of displays used in each ﬁeld in Fig. 4, we observe that the majority of publications in the ﬁeld AR ∩ IVA used some type of HMD, either video see-through or optical see-through, compared to using mobile devices such as cell phones and tablets. The opposite pattern is observed with AR ∩ IoT. We see more publications in AR ∩ IVA that built frameworks and or applications that were migratable to different display hardware, which can be explained by the age of this research ﬁeld. Many publications especially the ones involving IoT did not necessarily mention or use a display device mostly because their research was focused on techniques, algorithm, and theoretical frameworks. We also observe more publications focusing on new interfaces and interaction techniques in AR ∩ IoT which is understandable as virtual assistants and information overlay through mobile devices has shown to be a popular topic in this ﬁeld. We also computed the average yearly citation counts  ACC  for each ﬁeld of research which is shown in Fig. 5. The sudden increase in ACC for both AR ∩ IoT and IVA ∩ IoT is indicative of the fast-paced improvements and high impacts in both ﬁelds considering the high ACCs in 2016 and 2017.  5 The Convergence of AR and IVA  Although extensively researched in VR, intelligent agents have been introduced to AR for the ﬁrst time at the beginning of the new millennium. This convergence ﬁeld brings together the ﬁeld of AR, in which virtual content is overlaid or mixed with   A Systematic Review of the Convergence of Augmented Reality, Intelligent. . .  9  Fig. 5 Average yearly citation count per convergence ﬁeld  the physical world, and the ﬁeld of IVA, which is concerned with virtual agents and how these can interact with physical users and objects.  5.1 Meta-Review  At the intersection of AR and IVA, we found 65 publications with 143 classiﬁcations in total. Figure 2 shows the number of publications by year, and Fig. 3 shows them by classiﬁcation. As shown in Fig. 3, the majority of the publications in this ﬁeld included aspects of system development  33 , evaluation  31 , and employed agents and or setups that supported several input output modalities  42  with fewer papers focusing on applications  21 , collaboration  7 , interaction  6 , and survey papers  3 .  Looking at the types of displays used per year in Fig. 6, we noticed an inclination towards HMDs  28 . The second most used display type were ﬂat screens  14 , e.g., computer display, TV, etc., followed by publications supporting several hardware platforms  9 ; mobile devices  8 , e.g., cell phones and tablets; and a CAVE environment  1 . Five papers did not focus on aspects that would require speciﬁc displays.  We also looked at the input output modalities used in the publications in this ﬁeld. As shown in Fig. 7, light followed by sound were employed as the main modalities of the works published. We observe a similar number of input and output publications for light since many of the devices used in this ﬁeld included depth sensors and cameras as input and overlaid virtual content as output. We also see a higher number of publications using the sound modality as output due to many virtual characters being able to speak to users but not having speech recognition   10  N. Norouzi et al.

A few publications adopted sensors to bring about touch and motion capabilities and only one paper experimented with airﬂow. Ten publications in this ﬁeld had a citation count of four citations per year or higher. The average citation count in this ﬁeld was 1.9 citations per year  SD = 1.8 . The papers below were selected based on the citation count and qualitative criteria for years 2017 and 2018, for which the citation counts are not yet well established.  5.2 Impactful Papers and Trends  Barakonyi et al. [10] presented the ﬁrst general framework for IVAs called AR Puppet, which has been developed speciﬁcally for AR applications. They discussed agent-speciﬁc aspects of AR such as that IVAs should react to the physical envi- ronment, avoid collisions with physical obstacles, and should be able to inﬂuence objects in the real world. In later work, the authors introduced numerous AR   A Systematic Review of the Convergence of Augmented Reality, Intelligent. . .  11  applications in this ﬁeld [8, 9, 11]. For instance, they presented an AR tabletop game called MonkeyBridge [11] in which small embodied IVAs dynamically recognized changes and events in both the virtual and physical world and adapted their movement behavior to these changes. Similar responses to dynamically changing physical environments in AR for IVAs were realized by Chekhlov et al. [18] in their high-impact Ninja on a Plane game, with SLAM-based sensing of the physical world. Blum et al. [14] presented an interactive location-aware AR game based on mobile AR devices and IVAs, which uses real locations and includes virtual characters with basic physical behaviors. They showed in a user study that the sense of embodiment has a positive impact on player experience.  Multiple publications were focused on IVAs in AR that exhibit more sophis- ticated reasoning, proactive behavior, and some awareness of the non-verbal behaviors of a real human [44, 45, 52, 67]. Others examined the effects of awareness and inﬂuence of IVAs in AR settings using cameras, microphones, and custom devices to develop automated awareness of environmental effects such as sounds, movements  felt and observed , light, air ﬂow, and IVA interactions with other humans [21, 39, 40, 48, 50, 70]. The results indicate that, like VR, congruent and plausible behaviors matter—virtual humans and objects should be responsive to real-world events. However, in practice, it is much more difﬁcult in AR, because unlike the case with VR, where the system controls everything, AR systems are typically unaware of dynamic real people and events. As recognized by Helen Papagiannis, “the second wave of Augmented Reality  AR  is driven by a contextual understanding and interaction with your surroundings” [60].  Much high-impact research on IVAs in AR was driven by application ﬁelds demanding more useful and engaging IVA technology. For instance, Hantono et al. [31] reviewed the literature between 2005 and 2015 concerning IVAs in AR with respect to possible uses in education. They observed that most AR realizations at that time were not personalized to the user or the environment, limiting the learning experience. Wagner et al. [75] presented one of the ﬁrst IVAs in  hand-held  AR for educational purposes. A wide range of prototypes of IVAs in AR were developed for application contexts [4, 17, 30, 42, 61].  In a highly cited paper, Dow et al. [23] described an interactive drama using autonomous characters presented on an AR HMD, artiﬁcial intelligence-based story management, and natural language processing to immerse the player in a dramatic story in AR. They showed with a qualitative study that AR interfaces make the experience with IVAs more immediate and can lead to a higher level of perceived presence in a dramatic story than desktop interfaces. Interestingly, their results also showed that this AR-enhanced immediacy of the experience does not necessarily lead to higher engagement with IVAs since players do not perceive there to be a safe zone for them to experiment and make mistakes.  Holz et al. [36] presented a multidimensional classiﬁcation method to understand differences in the realization of IVA prototypes in mixed reality called the MiRA  Mixed Reality Agents  Cube, which divides agents based on their corporeal presence  virtual to physical , their interactive capacity  virtual to physical , and their agency  weak to strong .   12  N. Norouzi et al.  While most embodied IVAs in AR are presented on projection screens or HMDs, Krum et al. [46] presented a mixed reality projection framework called REFLCT for IVAs and virtual content in general that couples a near-axis head- mounted projector with retroreﬂective props and surfaces to provide personalized, perspective-correct imagery that is uniquely composited for each user directly into and onto a surrounding environment. They demonstrated it with a virtual character that made eye contact with each person in a group of visitors.  Lee et al. [51] evaluated an optical see-through HMD as a means to present IVAs in AR. They performed a user study and showed that the limited ﬁeld of view of current-state AR HMDs changes users’ locomotion behavior and proxemics in the presence of an embodied IVA. They further found that subtle vibrotactile feedback of the IVA’s footsteps transmitted through the ﬂoor while walking can signiﬁcantly beneﬁt a user’s sense of copresence.  Overall, with a few exceptions, the highest impact in the convergence ﬁeld of IVA and AR so far was made by publications focusing on system prototypes driven by application needs. Researchers have made continuous low-key progress on IVAs in AR since the early 2000s, but research on the nature and underlying peculiarities of IVAs in AR is still in its infancy compared to related efforts for IVAs in VR.  6 The Convergence of IVA and IoT  While the concept of IoT goes back to the early 2000s, it took until around 2014 with the release of Amazon Echo, and the integration of IoT devices into the agent’s affordances, for research in this convergence ﬁeld to take off. This convergence ﬁeld brings together the ﬁeld of IVA, which is concerned with virtual agents and how these can interact with physical objects and users, and the ﬁeld of IoT, which strives to network physical devices, including sensors, appliances, and displays, to improve interaction and control by virtualizing the components.  6.1 Meta-Review  At the intersection of IVA and IoT, we found 43 publications with 60 classiﬁcations in total. Figure 2 shows the publications by year, and Fig. 3 shows them by classiﬁcation. Fifteen publications in this ﬁeld had a citation count of four citations per year or higher. The average citation count in this ﬁeld was elevated to 4.29 citations per year with a large variance  SD = 6.32  due to a few highly cited papers in this ﬁeld.  As shown in Fig. 3, the majority of the publications in this ﬁeld focused on system development  19 , followed by evaluation  10 , survey  10 , application  9 ,   A Systematic Review of the Convergence of Augmented Reality, Intelligent. . .  13  Fig. 8 Variety of displays used over time in the ﬁeld of IVA and IoT  Input  Output  s n o i t a c  i l  b u P    f o   r e b m u N  20  15  10  5  0  Light  Sound  Touch  Motion Temperature  Fluid  Smell  Airflow  I O Type  Fig. 9 Publications in the ﬁeld of IVA and IoT grouped based on the modalities used  and multimodal aspects  9 . Considering the novelty of the ﬁeld, only one publica- tion investigated collaborative opportunities, and two publications introduced new interaction techniques.  As shown in Fig. 8, with publications focusing on voice-based assistants such as Amazon Alexa, algorithms and theoretical frameworks, and survey papers, the majority of them did not include a speciﬁc type of display  27 , followed by ﬂat screen displays  8 , handheld devices  5 , HMDs  2 , and one paper that focused on several hardware devices. Looking at the type of input output modalities employed in the ﬁeld of IVA ∩ IoT, in Fig. 9 we see a similar pattern as in the ﬁeld of AR ∩ IVA with regard to the emphasis on using the light and sound modalities, but the difference here is the increase in the number of publications that utilized sound as input through speech recognition which is in line with many smart home virtual assistant systems.   14  N. Norouzi et al.  6.2 Impactful Papers and Trends  Soda et al. [71] developed one of the ﬁrst prototypes of a voice-based IVA system in the scope of a research project, using a device with a microphone array as an interface for smart home devices, similar to the later consumer devices popularized by Amazon, Apple, and Google, among others, for natural interaction with IoT devices.  Multiple highly cited papers focused on comparative evaluations of the different consumer products being released over the last years in the ﬁeld of IVA and IoT. For instance, López et al. [53] presented a comparison of existing speech-based IVAs like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. The authors describe a user study in which the effectiveness of the speech-based user interfaces was evaluated. Reis et al. [66] proposed a model that allows elderly people to more easily interact with IVAs, and they compared Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and others to evaluate which of the devices assistants would incorporate the proposed model most efﬁciently. Druga et al. [24] conducted a user study that involved children interacting with IVAs including Amazon Alexa among others. The children were surveyed with regard to the agents’ trust, intelligence, personality, and engagement. The authors proposed design modiﬁcations for IVAs that are capable of interacting with children in the future. Hoffman and Novak [35] provided a general discussion of the experience of consumers when interacting with IVAs and IoT networks.  Knote et al. [42] presented a recent literature review of applications for IVA assistants. The authors identiﬁed three application domains  daily life and family, work support, and e-learning  in which future research is particularly promising. Austerjost et al. [6] developed voice-based agent user interfaces for a virtual “lab assistant.” The virtual assistant, through IoT devices, could control and modify physical devices and data and react to speech command inquiries.  With the aim to better understand IoT networks in smart home environments, Helal et al. [33] and Lee and Cho et al. [49] presented simulators with 3D autonomous agents that populate a smart home environment, trigger motion detec- tors, etc. They modeled a typical human behavior and provide a user interface to keep track of the state of the IoT network and smart environment.  Since all new technology, including IVAs and IoT in digital ecosystems like Amazon Alexa, has security concerns and could be used to commit crimes due to natural voice-based interfaces with the IVA and related vulnerabilities or could in general be important as potential sources of digital evidence for crimes committed in the real world [19], Chung and Park et al. [20] developed a proof-of-concept digital forensics tool, called CIFT, that supports identiﬁcation, acquisition, and analysis of the state and actions within such an IVA-IoT ecosystem. To prevent the illegitimate use of one’s private data in an IVA-IoT ecosystem, e.g., in commercial systems, Campagna et al. [16] developed open, crowdsourced, privacy-preserving, and programmable virtual assistant architecture, called Almond.  Overall, early research on the convergence of IVA and IoT had not received much attention in terms of citations in the research community, potentially because the   A Systematic Review of the Convergence of Augmented Reality, Intelligent. . .  15  research communities on IVA and IoT were focusing on other challenges at the time. However, commercial developments and products extended that early research demonstrated the importance for our daily life and thus caused a widespread interest by researchers in this convergence ﬁeld over the last years.  7 The Convergence of AR and IoT  This convergence ﬁeld brings together the ﬁeld of AR, in which virtual content is overlaid or mixed with the physical world, and the ﬁeld of IoT, in which physical devices are connected and virtualized for computer-controlled networked interaction.  7.1 Meta-Review  At the intersection of AR and IoT, we found 79 publications with 135 classiﬁcations in total. Figure 2 shows the publications by year, and Fig. 3 shows them by classiﬁcation. Ten publications in this ﬁeld had a citation count of four citations per year or higher. The average citation count in this ﬁeld was 2.19 citations per year  SD = 3.66 . Papers in the ﬁeld of AR ∩ IoT were mostly concerned with system development and theoretical frameworks  42 , followed by application topics  22 , evaluation  20 , interaction  14 , and survey papers  8 . Twenty-six papers employed multi- modal setups, and three papers developed collaborative designs.  As shown in Fig. 10, many of the publications in this ﬁeld relied on mobile devices to implement and display their work  36 , and fewer used HMDs  14 , followed by ﬂat screens  4 , cross-displays  5 , and projection-based AR  2 . A good number of papers focusing on theoretical aspects did not employ a speciﬁc display for their work  18 , and ﬁve papers developed frameworks that could be used on different types of displays.  As shown in Fig. 11 we see a high number of publications with light input output and fewer with sound input output which can be seen as human modalities or qualities of an IVA. Touch, motion, and temperature sensors were slightly more used in this ﬁeld compared to others which also include speciﬁc IoT sensors in the environment affecting virtual content.  7.2 Impactful Papers and Trends  Most research at the intersection of AR and IoT considered AR as an interface for IoT devices that avoided limitations of traditional user interfaces in smart home   16  N. Norouzi et al.

Gimenez and Pous [29] noted that “AR has recently been touted as one of the ideal interfaces for IoT.” For instance, Garcia-Macias et al. [26] presented a mobile AR application to “browse” through the Internet of things. The rationale for using AR was that IoT unlike the traditional Internet constitutes a mix of virtual and physical entities. The authors developed a mobile AR application similar to a magic lens that lets users see smart objects in their environment when the mobile AR device is pointed at them, thus allowing the user to understand the virtual services provided by the IoT devices and interact with them. Wirtz et al. [76] presented a similar approach with the difference that the smart devices in the environment would not be directly connected to the Internet but connect to the mobile AR device on demand when pointing the AR device at the smart device. Another similar system was proposed by Heun et al. [34], called The Reality Editor, in which users hold a mobile AR device near a smart device to open an interface that allows users to reprogram the behavior of the smart device and to deﬁne relationships between smart devices in order to create new functionalities.   A Systematic Review of the Convergence of Augmented Reality, Intelligent. . .  17  Kasahara et al. [38] further extended the approach with mobile AR as an interface for IoT to a novel class of actuated IoT devices. In their prototype, users could point a mobile AR device at an actuated smart connected appliance, and by touching the screen of the mobile AR device, users could then drag the target in the AR view, which the smart appliance would then match using an actuated motion platform.  Instead of using mobile AR devices, Lik-Hang and Pan [47] recently resumed different ways in which AR glasses and corresponding user interfaces could provide an accessible and intuitive user interface for interaction in a modern smart home environment. To note are in particular gestural and gaze-based interfaces, which allow users to control smart home appliances at a distance, e.g., by ﬂicking a ﬁnger towards a light to turn it off without having to walk over to a light switch [43, 78]. Martin and LaViola [55] further introduced a Transreality Interaction Platform  TrIP  to “enable service ecosystems which situate virtual objects alongside virtu- alized physical objects and allow for novel ad-hoc interactions between humans, virtual, and physical objects in a transreality environment.”  While smart home environments with AR interfaces were among the highest cited papers, they were not the only application ﬁelds for using AR and IoT. For example, Hao and Helo [32] emphasized on the importance of AR and IoT for the manufacturing industry. They investigated the application of AR and wearable technology to visualize information derived from IoT sensor networks in a cloud manufacturing environment.  Also, AR has been used as a test-bed for IoT environments. In particular, Seo et al. [69] designed multiple test-beds to experience and understand smart home environments and IoT networks in VR and AR with respect to context and awareness, before they are realized in an actual smart home environment.  In contrast to the aforementioned research that largely leveraged AR as a tool for interaction with IoT devices, it is interesting to note that researchers so far have not fully leveraged IoT devices as a tool to improve AR experiences.  In the research ﬁeld of AR, various input and output devices have been proto- typed, some have been connected to the Internet, and some have been commercially pursued. However, while many of these research prototypes developed in the ﬁeld of AR could be realized in the form factor of an IoT device, this is hardly done so far. This might be explained by the perceived overhead involved in adhering to IoT protocols and standards and associated fears of added latency and suboptimal performance [68]. It may also be related to recent trends in the ﬁeld of AR today that most developments are egocentric with respect to a physical device, i.e., sensors and displays are mounted on the user’s body or head instead of them being placed throughout the environment, which makes it harder to think of them as Internet- connected things.  At the same time, we have to note that the steady integration of IoT capabilities into everyday devices all around us presents an opportunity for the addition of more allocentric pervasive real-world capabilities to AR. In particular, Jo and Kim [37] proposed an IoT extension to support scalable AR environments called ARIoT.   18  N. Norouzi et al.  We predict that over the next years, further advances in AR user interfaces and technologies towards everyday use cases in a smart home environment will give rise to the standardized integration of IoT devices into AR frameworks and the development of new IoT devices speciﬁcally for the purpose of enhancing AR experiences with improved sensing and multimodal sensations, e.g., driven by the gaming industry.  8 The Nexus of IVA, IoT, and AR  While each of these convergent technology thrusts has shown beneﬁts due to the integration of the research ﬁelds and can advance on their own, the nexus of the three concepts and technologies could enable further novel solutions and research direc- tions. In particular, we see a vexing vista for the future of virtual agent technologies that becomes possible and tractable at the intersection of the three ﬁelds. This idea of a sophisticated futuristic agent could be manifested in the form of an embodied augmented reality agent  ARA  with pervasive awareness, appearance, and abilities through IVA intelligence and human-agent communication, IoT networks to sense and inﬂuence the real world, and AR display and sensor technology to seamlessly blend the agent with the real world. Such empowered agent technologies would be transformational.  Beyond one’s physical “surroundings” [60] and the state of oneself and one’s home, the contextual awareness would be pervasive in that it could extend to all matters of one’s life that one allows  via privacy controls : one’s health, calendar, daily ﬁtness information, and even awareness of one’s family members—shared awareness between the ARAs of the family homes. Indeed, the awareness could include ongoing assessments of one’s physical and emotional health, which could be shared with a healthcare provider or family members. New privacy mechanisms would then be needed to control which aspects of awareness  and appearance and abilities  are shared.  The appearance of one’s ARA would be pervasive in that it could move around within one’s home, e.g., appearing anywhere in 3D if one is wearing an HMD, projected onto physical surroundings via spatial augmented reality [12, 62–65] in one’s IoT-enabled television, in the display of one’s IoT-enabled refrigerator, among others, to best match the current location of the human [8]. The ARA could be transferred to any network and device that one allows, e.g., one ARA could travel on one’s mobile devices, one’s car, and even one’s ofﬁce computer. One of many questions surrounding ARAs is whether there is value in seeing an embodied agent, even in cases where it is not necessary. For example, if one asks one’s agent to check the calendar to see if one is free for a date tonight, and the agent just says “Yes,” one might not trust the ARA’s response as much as if it appeared to carry out some action that corresponds in some way to checking one’s calendar. Among other things, we see the importance of new knowledge related to this “seeing is believing” and the importance of visual embodiments in general. More generally   A Systematic Review of the Convergence of Augmented Reality, Intelligent. . .  19  we see the need to advance knowledge on different agent representations based on their tasks and contexts and appearances that are adapted to each user [74], static or variable, which can range from single to multiple agent representations, e.g., when the agent is multitasking.  The abilities of one’s ARA would be pervasive in that it could have physical inﬂuence throughout one’s house under a variety of circumstances. For example, today one can purchase light switches and outlets that are compatible with various home automation protocols, e.g., Insteon, Z-Wave, and Zigbee. In the future, manufacturers could include AR features and data such as embedded textual and verbal descriptions, the ability to embed location information, etc. In terms of social inﬂuence [13], an ARA that is aware of one’s dietary circumstances could coach one on what to eat using immediate caloric information from one’s body-worn ﬁtness devices, awareness of one’s calendar for the day, etc. One’s ARA could directly inﬂuence the person, e.g., by greeting one cheerfully and appreciatively when one returns home from work—the “Cheers effect”  American sitcom —or could reach out to family members or friends if, for example, it becomes aware that one is overly tired or depressed. Among other directions, existing voice-controlled agents, home control, and custom technologies could be enhanced by giving ARAs the ability to control IoT devices.  There are two perspectives of ARA affordances [28] we propose should be examined: the affordances the ARA offers to the human and the affordances the environment offers to the ARA. For example, with respect to the former, embodied AR agents offer the opportunity to study the “seeing is believing” idea. With respect to the latter, ARA awareness of nonverbal communications by the human would support verbal instructions that are intentionally brief or ambiguous, such as “please turn of that light” while pointing to a particular lamp. This is in contrast to today’s voice agents where one has to remember and use the precise name corresponding to each device, e.g., “please turn off the Living Room Floor Lamp!”  In summary, by extrapolating from the current developments discussed above, we believe that these affordances become tractable at the intersection of the three research ﬁelds AR, IVA, and IoT. As technology and prototypes are developed to address these challenges, we see much potential for an interesting and transforma- tive research domain being established at the nexus of the three ﬁelds.  9 Conclusion  In this chapter, we resumed the body of literature at the convergence ﬁelds between augmented reality, intelligent virtual agents, and the Internet of things. We performed a literature search at the intersections between each two of these ﬁelds, and we analyzed the research topic categories of the publications and their impact as indicated by their citation count. We further highlighted and reviewed the most impactful papers and trends in these convergence ﬁelds. Our results show a large   20  N. Norouzi et al.  increase in publications in these convergence ﬁelds over the last years and much potential for future research. We predict that the three ﬁelds will grow in importance over the next years and attract interdisciplinary research teams to advance the technology development and improve our understanding of the challenges and goals in these ﬁelds. Finally, we presented our vision for the convergence of all three technologies.  References  1. Al-Fuqaha, A., Guizani, M., Mohammadi, M., Aledhari, M., & Ayyash, M.  2015 .

Improving the Physical Layer Security of IoT-5G Systems  Jehad M. Hamamreh  1 Introduction  Security is becoming not only a necessary and critical requirement in communi- cation networks but also a powerful mean and tool to maintain the sustainability and usefulness of the digital world we are living in [1, 2]. It has recently become very obvious that the super beneﬁts in terms of new Internet of Things  IoT -based services and applications that future 5G and beyond wireless networks are expected to provide cannot be practically realized without ensuring security and having it as a high priority [3, 4]. Particularly, security forms a formidable challenge for the new emerging massive and critical IoT-5G type of services such as massive machine-type communication  mMTC  and ultra-reliable low-latency communication  URLLC  due to their unique features and requirements [5, 6].  Among the many important security aspects and goals including conﬁdentiality, privacy, authentication, integrity, availability, and so forth, conﬁdentiality comes at the highest priority. Providing conﬁdentiality is a challenging task to achieve in wireless systems mainly because of the broadcast nature of the wireless transmis- sion, where the transmitted signals can be captured and recorded by malicious users in the networks in order to intercept the undergoing communication between the legitimate parties. This results in not only eavesdropping their data but also in using this eavesdropped data to launch more attacks such as identity-based attack, denial of service  DoS , man-in-the-middle, data modiﬁcation, session hijacking, spooﬁng  impersonation , and snifﬁng. These critical vulnerabilities could signiﬁcantly affect the authenticity, conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability of the communication link  J. M.

Hamamreh  between legitimate users [7, 8]. This necessitates providing security defense against eavesdropping, which is considered to be one of the most critical attacks that is needed as a prerequisite to launch any kind of attacks in the network.  Traditionally, conﬁdentiality against eavesdropping has been tackled using cryp- tography and encryption-based approaches. However, the tremendous technological advances in future wireless networks  e.g., 5G and beyond networks  substantiate the need for new alternative security methods that can meet and address new challenges that did not exist before. This makes the classically used crypto- graphic techniques unsuitable, ineffective, and even impractical in future wireless networks and services due to many hindrances, among which, we mention the key distribution and management processes for the legitimate parties. These are extremely difﬁcult tasks, especially in large-scale, dense, and heterogeneous wire- less networks, where a massive amount of smart IoT devices are simultaneously connected to the network, causing excessive complexity, high overhead, and costly computational processes. Besides, the management and control frames exchanged between communication entities are usually not protected. More importantly, the emergence of new wireless technologies like IoT-based mMTC, 5G-Tactile Internet, vehicular communication for autonomous driving, remote surgery, instant control for sensitive IoT actuators, etc. makes current encryption-based methods unsuitable since these kind of technologies are naturally delay-sensitive, power-limited, and processing-restricted.  To address this, physical layer security based on keyless approach has emerged as a new concept and strong alternative that can supplement and may even replace encryption-based approaches [9–11]. The basic idea of physical layer security is to exploit channel characteristics such as noise, fading, dispersion, and interference, in order to provide secrecy against eavesdropping [9, 12].  Due to the fact that orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing  OFDM  is the most commonly used waveform in currently existing systems and is expected to keep its dominance with different numerologies in future wireless systems like 5G, securing OFDM waveform has drawn the attention of many researchers. It is worth mentioning that besides developing techniques tailored to common transmit waveforms like OFDM, there have recently been some efforts to design new inherently secure waveforms as in [13–15].  In the literature, several OFDM-based security techniques have been proposed. These techniques can be categorized from a high-level viewpoint into four main enabling schemes. First are secret key-based schemes, in which secret random sequences are generated from the channel and then used to encrypt the transmitted data on either the application layer [16] or the physical layer such as dynamic coordinate interleaving and constellation rotation schemes [17]. Second are adaptive transmission-based schemes, in which the transmission parameters are adjusted to just meet the quality of service  QoS  requirements of only the legitimate receiver [18]. Among these techniques are optimal power allocation [19], adaptive modu- lation with hybrid automatic repeat request  HARQ  [20], adaptive precoding and interleaving [21], fading-based subcarrier deactivation schemes [22], and channel shortening [23]. Third are artiﬁcial noise  AN -based schemes [24], in which AN   Improving the Physical Layer Security of IoT-5G Systems  27  is designed based on the legitimate receiver’s channel so that it only harms the eavesdropper’s reception while maintaining an interference-free reception at the legitimate user. Fourth are schemes that can exploit OFDM transceiver impairments [25] or conceal some key features in the OFDM signal to provide secrecy [26].  Among the aforementioned techniques, OFDM-SIS  subcarrier index selection  [27] is a recently proposed ﬂexible and adaptive technique that not only provides secrecy but also improves the reliability performance with minimal complexity, making it a very attractive technique for future secure IoT-5G systems. However, although the optimal subcarrier index selection technique  OFDM-SIS  can provide a relatively good secrecy performance, its secrecy gap is limited and may not be sufﬁcient in speciﬁc scenarios, where it is highly desirable to increase and ensure secrecy even when Eve’s average signal-to-noise ratio  SNR  is much higher than that of Bob.  Therefore, this work comes to address the aforementioned limitation of OFDM- SIS by enhancing its secrecy further and maintaining a good secrecy gap over all SNR ranges. In the proposed scheme, named as OFDM-SIS with artiﬁcially inter- fering signals  OFDM-SIS-AIS , the whole OFDM block is divided into subblocks, each containing good and bad subcarriers. The good subcarriers, corresponding to high subchannel gains, are used for data transmission in order to maximize the SNR at only the legitimate receiver, while the rest  the bad ones  are injected with AIS that can only degrade Eve’s reception while not affecting Bob’s performance whatsoever. The provided results prove the effectiveness of the proposed design in enhancing the secrecy gap considerably over all SNR regimes while keeping the bit error rate  BER  performance of the legitimate receiver as that achieved by OFDM-SIS.  The rest of this chapter is organized as follows. The system model and its preliminaries are described in Sect. 2. The details of the proposed OFDM-SIS- AIS scheme are revealed in Sect. 3. Computer simulation results are exhibited and discussed in Sect. 4. Finally, a concise conclusion is drawn in Sect. 5.

The channels of both Bob and Eve, denoted by hb ∈ C [1×L] , respectively, are assumed to experience multipath slowly varying channels with L exponentially decaying taps, each with Rayleigh fading distribution. Moreover, as  and he ∈ C  [1×L]   28  Fig. 1 A simpliﬁed system model of the considered PHY security scenario  J. M. Hamamreh  Reference Sounding  Signals  RSS  hb  he  AliceAlice  BobBob  EveEve  Eve is a passive node in practice, Alice is assumed to have no knowledge of Eve’s channel.  [N×1]   cid:3 T ∈ C  Moreover, both Bob and Eve are assumed to experience uncorrelated channels as the channel varies according to the positions of communicating nodes [14]. In addition, time division duplexing  TDD  system is adopted, where Alice and Bob estimate the channel state information  CSI  of their common link by sending sounding reference signals  SRS . This will prevent Eve from accessing or having the knowledge of the CSI of the legitimate link [14] as there is no explicit CSI feedback. At Alice, N number of frequency-domain complex data symbols is trans- mitted. Thus, the frequency-domain OFDM symbol can be represented as s =  cid:2  s0 s1 . . . sN−1 . The OFDM symbol is then interleaved in order to eliminate the correlation between the subchannels and make the effective channel response look random and completely independent as shown in Fig. 2. This is performed so that we can ensure distributing the deep-faded subchannels uniformly over the whole OFDM symbol and thus guarantee to experience a few deep-faded subchannels in each subblock. In this work, we consider using an adaptive CSI- dependent interleaver, denoted by a unitary matrix R of size N × N, where the entries of each column are all zeros except a single entry of value equals to one at the position of the subcarrier to be permutated [21]. We select CSI-based adaptive interleaving as it is known to be the best in terms of mitigating burst errors  or consecutive deep-faded subchannels  and make them uniformly distributed over the whole OFDM block when the CSI is available at Tx [28].  It is worth mentioning that the interleaver design devised in [21] was perceived as a kind of precoder due to the fact that R was extracted by applying singular value decomposition  SVD  on the diagonal matrix of the channel amplitude frequency response and then taking the right unitary matrix, resulting from the decomposition, as the interleaver. For more details on this, we refer the readers to [21, 28]. It should also be mentioned that we do not consider in our performance evaluation the secrecy level that can be obtained by the channel-based adaptive interleaver design as it has   1.5  1  0.5  1.5  1  0.5  e d u  t i l  p m a    l  e n n a h C  e d u  t i l  p m a    l  e n n a h c   e v i t c e  f f  E  0.8  0.6  0.4  0.2  0.8  0.6  0.4  0.2  e d u  t i l  p m a    l  e n n a h C  e d u  t i l  p m a    l  e n n a h c   e v i t c e  f f  E  Improving the Physical Layer Security of IoT-5G Systems  29  Bob's Channel  Eve's Channel  0  0  10  20  30  40 Frequency index  50  60  0  0  10  20  30  40 Frequency index  50  60  0  0  10  20  30  40 Frequency index  50  60  0  0  10  20  30  40 Frequency index  50  60  Fig. 2 Bob’s and Eve’s channel frequency responses alongside their effective channels after interleaving, i.e., Hf  eR  shown in the lower part of the ﬁgure   bR and Hf  already been investigated in the literature [21]. Rather, we focus on the secrecy level obtained by the optimal subcarrier index selection along with artiﬁcially interfering signals injection.  Similar to OFDM-IM [29], where the whole OFDM block is split into subblocks and only a subset of the available subcarriers in each subblock is utilized for data transmission, here we adopt a similar structure; however, in our technique, the subcarriers are selected based on the channel of the legitimate receiver to improve secrecy. This is different from OFDM-IM, where the subcarriers are selected based on the incoming data to convey information by the subcarrier indices so that better reliability can be achieved at the expense of a minor spectral efﬁciency loss. The details of the proposed OFDM-SIS-AIS security technique will be explained in the next section. [N×N] , which basically maps the data points to orthogonal subcarriers, where F is the discrete Fourier transform matrix. To preclude the inter-symbol interference, a cyclic preﬁx  CP  of length L is inserted by using the CP appending matrix C ∈ [ N+L ×N] . Thus, the transmitted baseband signal by Alice  before considering R the proposed design  can be represented as x = CFHRs ∈ C  The interleaved block  Rs  is then passed through an IFFT process FH ∈ C  [ N+L ×1]   1   .

Thus, the net-received signal vector with dimensions N × 1 at Bob after performing the aforementioned operations can be given in a linear matrix representation form as follows:  On the other hand, at Eve, the captured signal after the FFT process can be formulated as   cid:4   yb = FD  HbCFHRs + zb bRs + ˆzb.  = Hf   cid:5    cid:5    cid:4   ye = FD  = Hf [ N+L × N+L ]  HeCFHRs + ze eRs + ˆze. and He ∈ C   2    3    4    5   [ N+L × N+L ]  = FDHbCFH = diag[Hb1 ,··· , HbN  In this model, Hb ∈ C are the Toeplitz matrices corresponding to the channel impulse responses of both Bob and Eve, whereas Hf FDHeCFH = diag[He1 ,··· , HeN b are the diagonal matrices correspond- ing to the channel frequency responses of Bob and Eve, respectively. Note that Hbi and Hei for 1≤ i≤ N denote the subchannel frequency response of the ith subcarrier with respect to Bob and Eve, respectively. The vectors zb and ze are formed by the samples of the zero-mean complex additive white Gaussian noise  AWGN  with e at Bob and Eve, respectively, while ˆzb and ˆze are the Fourier- variances of σ 2 transformed versions of the noise vectors at Bob and Eve, respectively.  ] ∈ C  b and σ 2  e =  ] ∈ C  and Hf  [N×N]  [N×N]  3 Review of OFDM-Subcarrier Index Selection  OFDM-SIS   In the OFDM-SIS scheme [27], the transmitted OFDM block, i.e., s, is ﬁrst divided and partitioned into a set of smaller subblocks, each containing K number of subcarriers. The basic idea of the proposed scheme is to enlarge the gap between Bob and Eve’s capacities by making the effective SNR at Bob higher than that at Eve for a given channel frequency response. This is achieved by dividing the K subcarriers in each subblock into two subsets: the ﬁrst, which includes the subcarriers corresponding to the highest subchannel gains, is used for data transmission  to maximize the effective SNR at Bob , whereas the second, which includes the subcarriers corresponding to the lowest channel gains, is suppressed and nulled  i.e., not used for data transmission . Particularly, for each subblock, a set of M out of K subcarriers is optimally selected to maximize the SNR at Bob, while the remaining K − M, which are not used for data transmission, are ﬁlled with zeros. Here, ζ = M K is deﬁned as the   Improving the Physical Layer Security of IoT-5G Systems  31  subcarrier activation ratio of the number of selected subcarriers to the number of available subcarriers in each subblock. Note that the SNR of Bob over each subcarrier can be given by SN Rbi , where P is the power allocated to each subcarrier. Now, the problem of the optimal selection of the indices of M subcarriers corresponds to solving the below optimization problem for all possible subcarrier combinations, given as  = γb = PHbi  σ 2 b  2  {c  opt 1  ,··· , c  opt M  } = arg  max  SN Rb[c1,··· ,cM ] ,  {c1,··· ,cM}∈AM   6  where AM denotes the set of all possible subcarrier combinations with M selected out of K subcarriers and SN Rb[c1,··· ,cM ] is the sum of SNRs of the M selected subcarriers in each subblock. Since uniform power allocation is used for all subcarriers, the aforementioned problem boils down to selecting the subcarriers corresponding to the best subchannel gains.  This can be given as below  {c  opt 1  opt , c 2  ,··· , c  opt M  } = arg  max  {c1,··· ,cM}∈AM  Hb[c1,··· ,cM ] .  cid:7  =   cid:6   K!   7   K M  M! K−M ! , may That is, ﬁnding all possible subcarrier combinations, i.e., cause huge complexity, especially when the block size is very large. Therefore, it is important to considerably reduce the complexity of solving the above problem. This is possible when the whole OFDM block is divided into smaller parts to decrease the size of the search space. Moreover, it is also required to guarantee that, in each subblock, the subcarriers have to experience independent and different high and low subchannel gains so that the high ones with respect to Bob can be used for data transmission, while the low ones are suppressed  i.e., ﬁlled with zeros . the optimization problem, Alice can select M  1≤ M ≤ K  out of K subcarriers that maximizes the effective instantaneous SNR at Bob in each subblock by ﬁrst ranking the subcarriers based on their instantaneous channel gains in a descending order, i.e., { cid:5 Hb1 cid:5 2 ≥ cid:5 Hb2 cid:5 2 ≥··· ≥ cid:5 HbK cid:5 2}. Then, Alice selects the ﬁrst M indices of the subcarriers corresponding to the sorted subchannel gains.  to further minimize the complexity of  Now,  In this scheme, the transmitted baseband signal by Alice can be reformulated as  x = CFHRP  ∈ C  [ N+L ×1]  ,   cid:8    cid:9   sd sz   8   where sd = [s 1 , s 2 , . . . , s N−Nr  ]T is the vector of Nd = N − Nr = ζ N frequency data symbols and sz = [s 1 , s 2 , . . . , s Nr  ]T is the zero vector of Nr =  1− ζ  N frequency points  i.e., nulled subcarriers . P is the permutation matrix, which determines the positions of the data and the nulled subcarriers within the subblocks of each OFDM symbol.   32  J. M. Hamamreh  4 Proposed OFDM-Subcarrier Index Selection  with Artiﬁcially Interfering Signals  OFDM-SIS-AIS   Although the OFDM-SIS technique discussed in the previous section can provide a relatively good secrecy performance as demonstrated in [27], its secrecy gap may not be sufﬁcient enough in speciﬁc scenarios, where it is highly desirable to increase the secrecy gap even when Eve’s average SNR is higher than that of Bob. In addition, despite the fact that OFDM-SIS technique is motivated  besides its low complexity and better reliability  by its capability to work in the worst security scenario, where the CSI of the legitimate link can be accessed by Eve due to using explicit feedback as is the case in FDD systems, the technique adheres and maintains its applicability in TDD systems as well and can be modiﬁed in such a way to boost the achievable secrecy performance  especially in scenarios where Eve’s SNR is higher than that of Bob . This is possible in TDD systems by utilizing the fact that Eve has no knowledge on the CSI between the legitimate parties due to using channel reciprocity-dependent sounding techniques for CSI acquisition instead of sending public channel feedback [10]. This will make Eve ignorant to the indices of the subcarriers used for data transmission.  Motivated by these facts, secrecy performance of the proposed design can be enhanced when TDD is adopted by utilizing the remaining nulled subcarriers, which are not used for data transmission. Particularly, these nulled subcarriers can be injected and ﬁlled by well-designed artiﬁcially interfering signals  AIS  that can only degrade Eve’s reception as visualized in Fig. 3 while not affecting Bob’s performance whatsoever.  It is obvious from Fig. 3 that, with respect to Bob, the transmitted data points correspond to high subchannel gains, while the AIS-injected subcarriers correspond to deep-faded subchannels; on the other hand, it is not the same with respect to Eve, whose channel looks random with respect to the optimally selected subcarriers at Alice. We call this secure transmission scheme enhanced OFDM-subcarrier index selection with artiﬁcially interfering signals  OFDM-SIS-AIS  injection. In this scheme, the transmitted baseband signal by Alice can be formulated as  x = CFHRP  ∈ C  [ N+L ×1]  ,   cid:8    cid:9   sd sr   9   symbols within each OFDM block.  where sd = [s 1 , s 2 , . . . , s N−Nr  ]T is a vector of Nd = N − Nr frequency data symbols and sr = [s 1 , s 2 , . . . , s Nr  ]T is a vector of Nr artiﬁcially interfering In the proposed design, sr is judiciously designed to have a distribution and power level similar to that of the data-modulated symbols. This is made as so in order to preclude and prohibit Eve from distinguishing the samples of AIS vector  sd  from that of the data vector itself  sr . For instance, in the case when QPSK modulation is used, sr can be designed according to the below formula   Improving the Physical Layer Security of IoT-5G Systems  33  Subblocks  10 Frequency index  20  30  10 Frequency index  20  30  l    s o b m y s   a t a d   d e t t i  m s n a r T  s r e i r r a c b u s   d e t c e e s   e h t   r e v o  l     i  g n v a e l r e  t  n  i    b o B    f  o    l  e n n a h c   e v i t c e  l  d e s a b − e n n a h c   r e  f f  E  t f  a  0  0  1.2  1  0.8  0.6  0.4  0.2  1.5  1  0.5  0  0  l    s o b m y s   a t a d   d e t t i  m s n a r T  s r e i r r a c b u s   d e t c e e s   e h t   r e v o  l  i  g n v a e l r e  t  n  i    e v E    f  o    l  e n n a h c   e v i t c e  l  d e s a b − e n n a h c   r e  f f  E  t f  a  0  0  1.2  1  0.8  0.6  0.4  0.2  0.8  0.6  0.4  0.2  0  0  10  20  30  Frequency index of Bob’s channel  10  20  30  Frequency index of Eve’s channel  Fig. 3 Subcarrier structure of the designed secure OFDM-SIS-AIS scheme with ζ = 3 4: In each subblock, surrounded by red rectangle, the subcarriers  blue-colored  experiencing good subchannel gains with respect to Bob are used for data transmission, while the rest  black-colored  are injected with AIS.

For Bob, the positions  indices  of these AIS can be obtained from the previous optimization algorithm as the complement of the indices that maximize the SNR at Bob.  Accordingly, the captured frequency domain signal at Bob’s side can be given as   cid:8    cid:9   sd sr  yb = Hf  + ˆzb ∈ C  [N×1]  bRP   11  After discarding the subcarriers injected with AIS, yb will have the size of  ζ N × 1. Bob then employs the low-complexity zero-forcing frequency-domain equalization and deinterleaving to detect the transmitted data symbols.  .   34  J. M. Hamamreh  At Eve’s side, its captured signal can be given by + ˆze ∈ C  ye = Hf   cid:9    cid:8   eRP  [N×1]  .  sd sr   12   Note that Eve cannot avoid the effect of the added AIS in the deep fades of the legitimate channel, which is different from her channel, and thus Eve can only make random guesses. Without loss of generality, for Eve to detect the transmitted sym- bols, she equalizes its received data symbols vector by its corresponding effective channel frequency response. Note that Eve will not have the same performance as that of the legitimate receiver due to the fact that her channel is different from Bob’s one. In other words, since the selected subcarriers at Alice are independent of Eve’s channel, the M strongest, selected transmit subcarriers for Bob correspond to a random set selection of transmit subcarriers with respect to Eve.  It is worth mentioning that the extra degree of freedom formed by OFDM-SIS- AIS scheme can provide ﬂexibility in the OFDM design in the sense that it can be exploited to not only enhance secrecy with minimal capacity reduction but also to perform other useful functionalities. More precisely, the AIS can intelligently be redesigned to reduce peak-to-average power ratio  PAPR , out-of-band emission  OOBE , and or adjacent channel interference  ACI  in multiuser scenario as is the case in unique-word OFDM waveform [30]. These kind of designs are beyond the scope of this paper but can be considered as a future work on the proposed technique from a waveform design perspective.  5 Performance Analysis  Assuming Eve is fully aware and knowledgeable of the applied PHY security technique  OFDM-SIS-AIS , then she can perform any of the following reception procedures:  1  Receive the whole OFDM symbol, and try to randomly guess the indices used for carrying useful data from that used for AIS injection. Note that since the structure of the AIS is the same as that of the data, Eve cannot beneﬁt from using intelligent detection technique and thus can never be certain about which subcarrier indices used for what purpose  i.e., data transmission or AIS injection .  2  Receive the OFDM symbol, and try to guess the indices used for data from that used for AIS injection based on Eve’s channel quality in a similar manner as Bob does. However, since the channel of Eve is different and independent from that of Bob, Eve will end up making mistakes in the process of selecting and deciding on the subcarrier indices used for data from that used for AIS injection.1  1Remark: If Eve is assumed to be not aware of the used security technique, Eve may think and assume that this is a normal received OFDM signal since the structure of the interference subcarriers is the same as that of the data, i.e., there is no distinctive features between the   Improving the Physical Layer Security of IoT-5G Systems  35  Note that since the process of identifying and detecting the subcarriers injected by AIS is fully random in both of the above-explained reception procedures, the performance results for both cases will be similar  this will be demonstrated in the numerical evaluation results . Accordingly, the investigation and theoretical analysis of one of the cases is sufﬁcient enough to provide and quantify the detailed performance of the proposed OFDM-SIS-AIS technique.  5.1 Error Probability Associated with Bob and Eve  Under the proposed OFDM-SIS-AIS design, the BER of Bob is anticipated to be the same as that of OFDM-SIS for any used selection ratio. This is due to the fact that Bob can  by using his channel estimate  simply detect and identify the subcarriers used for data transmission from those used for injecting AIS. Thus, Bob can exclude all these subcarriers ﬁlled with AIS in his detection process, resulting in an interference-free detection with a BER performance equivalent to that of OFDM- SIS technique that we have recently analyzed in our work in [27].  On the ﬂip side, the BER performance of Eve will not be the same as that of Bob due to injecting AIS as well as selecting the transmit subcarriers based on Bob’s channel. Thus, Eve will not be able to avoid the detrimental effect of AIS as her channel is different from that of Bob. Speciﬁcally, the error probability  Pe  of the inability of Eve to correctly detect the subcarriers injected with AIS in each subblock is equal to the product of two error probability events. The ﬁrst error event denoted by  Pe1 = 1− Pc1  represents the probability that the K − M subcarriers injected with AIS are detected wrongly in each subblock composed of K subcarriers, whereas the second error event denoted by  Pe2 = 1− Pc2  represents the probability that the K − M subcarriers injected with AIS are detected wrongly in the shortened subblock composed of the remaining K −  K − M  subcarriers. Mathematically, this can be given as  Pe = Pe1 × Pe2 =  1 − Pc1  ×  1 − Pc2  1 −  K − M  K −  K − M   1 −  K − M   ×  =   cid:11    cid:11    cid:12   K   cid:12   .  Thus, at high SNR regimes, Eve’s average BER can be simply formulated as  BERe = 1 2  × Pe = 1 2  × M  K  × 2M − K  .  M  subcarriers carrying data from that carrying interference at the receiving side with respect to Eve. Hence, Eve will try to decode the whole OFDM symbol as in usual cases without considering the fact that there are subcarriers that are ﬁlled with interference. In this case, the analysis will give worse results compared to the abovementioned cases.   13    14    36  J. M. Hamamreh  For the special case when ζ = 3 4, Pe can be given as   cid:11   1 −  4 − 3    cid:12   ×   cid:11    cid:12   1 −  4 − 3  4 −  4 − 3    cid:11    cid:12   Pe = =  = 1 2 In this case when ζ = 3 4, BERe is given as  ×  3 4  .   cid:12   4  cid:11  2 3  BERe = 1 2 For the case when ζ = 2 4, BERe = 1 2  .  × Pe = 1 2  × 1 2  = 1 4  .  5.2 Secrecy Outage Probability  In this subsection, we use the secrecy outage probability as a metric to analytically evaluate the secrecy performance of the proposed OFDM-SIS-AIS scheme. Secrecy outage is chosen as a suitable metric to quantify the performance because of the fact that the CSI of Eve’s channel in a practical passive eavesdropping scenario is neither available to Alice nor to Bob. Before calculating secrecy outage, we need ﬁrst to determine the effective SNR formulas at both Bob and Eve. Besides, we need to determine the effective channel distribution of both the good subchannel used for data transmission and the bad ones used for injecting AIS.  Since Bob knows exactly the locations  indices  of the subcarriers ﬁlled with interfering signals, he can just discard these subcarriers carrying non-data interfer- ing signals. Thus, Bob’s effective SNR will not be affected by interference, and it can be given per each subblock as  γb = ζHbi  2P σ 2 b  γe =  ζHei  2P   1−ζ  Hei ,int2Pint+σ 2  e  γe = φ1σ φ2τ+1 ,   15    16    17    18    19    Improving the Physical Layer Security of IoT-5G Systems  37  2, and τ = Hei ,int2. Note that 2 and Hei ,int2 have exponential power distribution. Consequently, the  , σ = Hei  σ 2 e  σ 2 e  , φ2 =  1−ζ  Pint  where φ1 = ζ P both Hei effective CDF of γ e can be found as follows: γe τ+1  σ=0   cid:13  +∞ τ=0  F  γe  =   cid:13   f  σ, τ  dσ dτ  =   cid:13  +∞ τ=0   cid:13   γe τ+1  σ=0  φ1φ2e −φ1σ  e −φ2τ  dσ dτ  = φ1φ2   cid:13  +∞ τ=0  e −φ2τ     cid:13   γe τ+1  σ=0  e −φ1σ  dσ dτ  = φ2   cid:13  +∞ τ=0  e −φ2τ  . 1 − e −φ1 1+τ  .γe  dτ   cid:14   = φ2  − e −φ1γe  φ2 + φ1.γe  1 φ2   cid:15   .  fγe  γe  = dF  γe   dγe  To ﬁnd the PDF of γ e, we derive the above CDF with respect to γ e to obtain   cid:8   = φ1φ2e −φ1γe .  1  φ1γe + φ2  +  1   φ1γe + φ2 2   cid:9   .  Now, having obtained the PDF and CDF of the effective instantaneous SNR at Eve as well as Bob, one can analytically ﬁnd and calculate the secrecy outage probability as follows. The secrecy outage probability can be given as [10]  Psout = Pr{Rsec < Rs},  where Rsec the proposed OFDM-SIS- is the instantaneous secrecy rate of AIS technique and is given by Rsec = [Rb − Re] + denotes max{0; x}, Rb = log2 1+ γ b  is the instantaneous rate of the Bob’s channel, and  , in which [q]  +   20    21    22    23    24    25    26    27    38  J. M. Hamamreh  Re = log2 1+ γ e  is the instantaneous rate of the Eve’s channel, whereas Rs > 0 is a predeﬁned targeted secrecy rate. The secrecy outage probability can be further deﬁned as [9]  Psout = Pr[Rsec   γe] Pr[γb > γe] + Pr[Rsec < Rs  γb ≤ γe] Pr[γb ≤ γe].   28  Since Pr[Rsec < Rs  γb ≤ γe] always equals to unity, the above formula can be reduced to  Psout = Pr[Rsec   γe] Pr[γb > γe]  + Pr[γb ≤ γe].  Using probability concepts, we can rewrite the previous formula as  Psout =   cid:13  ∞  Fγb  0   cid:4   cid:5  2Rs  1 + x  − 1  fγe  x dx,  where x= γ e, fγe  x  = Pγe  γe  and Fγb  .  is the CDF of Bob. The CDF of γ b heavily depends on the selection ratio  ζ   as explained in [27]. For the case when ζ = 2 4, Bob’s CDF is given as [27]  cid:14 √  √   cid:15    cid:7   √   cid:6 √  Fγb  x  = G  π erf  ρ  x  3 2  2ρ  −  −ρx  xe ρ  ,  where erf .  is the error function [31]. By substituting the CDF and PDF of the effective instantaneous SNR of Bob and Eve, respectively, into  30 , one can get the ﬁnal expression of Psout.   29    30    31   6 Simulation Results  In this section, we provide simulation results to demonstrate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed security schemes and to also examine the impacts of the selection ratio and the average SNRs on the security performance. We consider a practical SISO-OFDM system with N = 64 subcarriers adopting quadrature phase-shift keying  QPSK  modulation and a guard period of length L. The number of subblocks in each OFDM block is considered to be N K = 16, where each subblock contains K = 4 subcarriers. Two different values for the selection ratio ζ are considered, i.e., ζ = 3 4 and ζ = 2 4. The channel is modeled as an independent and identically distributed  i.i.d.  block fading, where channel coefﬁcients are drawn from a Rayleigh fading distribution and the channel is deemed to be slowly varying. The Rayleigh multipath fading channels of both Bob and Eve   Improving the Physical Layer Security of IoT-5G Systems  39  are assumed to have the same length, L= 9 samples, with a sparse, normalized power delay proﬁle given by p= [0.8407, 0, 0, 0.1332, 0, 0.0168, 0.0067, 0, 0.0027] mW.  Additionally, we consider that Eve is aware of the transmission technique used by Alice and also knows her CSI but does not know the channel of the legitimate link. In the performance evaluation, we use BER-based secrecy gap metric [14] to both evaluate the secrecy gap between Bob and Eve and to quantify the amount of information leakage to Eve.  Figure 4 exhibits the BER performance of the benchmark scheme  i.e., OFDM- SIS [27]  for both Bob and Eve. It is assumed that Eve is aware of the used scheme as well as the indices of the nulled subcarriers  which are not used for data transmission in OFDM-SIS  as these subcarriers have very low power  ideally zero , making it easy for her to identify and then exclude them from the detection process. It is shown that Eve’s performance is the same as that of standard OFDM. This happens due to the use of channel-dependent optimal subcarrier indices selection with respect to Alice-to-Bob channel that is different from Alice-to-Eve channel, for which the selection process looks random  not optimal . Thus, the system response will not be favorable to Eve, and no performance gain is delivered to her side. In contrast, Bob’s BER is enhanced as the selection ratio decreases due to sending the data over  R E B  100  10−1  10−2  10−3  10−4  10−5  10−6  10−7  0  Eve 2 4  OFDM−SIS−AIS  Eve 3 4  OFDM−SIS−AIS  Eve 2 4, 3 4  OFDM−SIS  OFDM−Standard = 4 4  OFDM−SIS  Bob 3 4  OFDM−SIS  Bob 3 4  OFDM−SIS−AIS  Bob 2 4  OFDM−SIS  Bob 2 4  OFDM−SIS−AIS   5  10  15  20  25  30  SNR  dB   Fig. 4 BER performance comparison between Bob and Eve when OFDM-SIS-AIS is used compared to OFDM-SIS.

Hamamreh  the subcarriers that are experiencing good subchannels with respect to only Bob. As noticed, the secrecy gap between Bob’s and Eve’s channel is promising and can be utilized to provide QoS-based secrecy [20]. However, as it can be observed, secrecy cannot be maintained over all SNR values. For instance, for ζ = 3 4 and for the case when Bob’s SNR is equal to or less than 18 dB, while Eve’s SNR is equal to or greater than 25 dB, Eve will be able −3, while Bob cannot. to reliably decode a service of BER requirement equals to 10 Thus, there is a security breach as the secrecy gap in this case will be negative. This problem can be addressed by the proposed OFDM-SIS-AIS scheme, where positive secrecy gap can be ensured at any SNR Bob and Eve may experience. Figure 4 presents the BER performance of both Bob and Eve using the proposed OFDM-SIS-AIS scheme with ζ = 3 4 and ζ = 2 4, compared to OFDM-SIS with the same ζ values and standard OFDM  equivalent to OFDM-SIS with ζ = 4 4 . It is depicted that the BER performance of Bob using OFDM-SIS-AIS remains the same as that of OFDM-SIS since Bob can just discard the subcarriers not used for data transmission as he knows his CSI, which is assumed in this technique to be estimated using channel sounding techniques in a TDD system. With respect to Eve, a considerable BER degradation is observed over all SNR ranges due to the artiﬁcially injected interfering signals, which cannot be avoided by Eve due to having a channel different than that of Bob. It is observed that the secrecy gap as well as the BER performance of Bob increases as the selection ratio decreases.  Figure 5 depicts the secrecy outage probability performance versus Bob’s average SNR. The performance achieved by the proposed OFDM-SIS-AIS scheme is also compared with conventional OFDM-SIS and standard OFDM schemes when the predeﬁned secrecy rate threshold is set to unity  i.e., Rs = 1  and Eve’s average SNR   ¯γe  is equal to 10 dB, whereas the selection ratio ζ equals to 2 4 and 3 4. From Fig. 5, we ﬁrst observe the OFDM-SIS-AIS scheme has superior performance  lower secrecy outage  compared to conventional OFDM-SIS scheme for ζ = 3 4 as well as ζ = 2 4. In addition, we notice that the decrease of ζ yields a better  lower  secrecy outage performance as the effective SNR at Bob increases, whereas the injection of AIS worsens Eve’s SNR, resulting in a larger SNR difference between Bob and Eve. In Fig. 6, we ﬁx the selection ratio ζ at 3 4 and change Eve’s average SNR ¯γe from 10 dB  as it was in the previous setup, whose performance is depicted in Fig. 5  to 0 and 20 dB. This is set as so in order to investigate the effect of changing ¯γe on the secrecy outage performance of OFDM-SIS-AIS and how it compares to conventional OFDM-SIS scheme. We can see that the secrecy outage performance gets lower when ¯γe decreases as expected. A more interesting observation is that the performance difference between the proposed OFDM-SIS-AIS scheme and the conventional OFDM-SIS gets larger as ¯γe increases, and vice versa  i.e., it gets lower as ¯γe decreases . The reason for this behavior is that the injection of AIS becomes less effective in degrading Eve’s performance when her SNR is already very bad  like 0 dB . Thus, the performance of OFDM-SIS-AIS boils down  i.e., become comparable  to that obtained by OFDM-SIS when Eve’s SNR is extremely very low as demonstrated in Fig. 6.

This occurs as in this case Eve will be highly affected negatively by the injected artiﬁcially interfering signals whose power levels are stronger at shorter distances from the transmitter. On the other hand, the performance difference between OFDM-SIS-AIS and OFDM-SIS schemes becomes very insigniﬁcant when Eve’s SNR is low  e.g., 0 dB  as in this case the effect of the injected artiﬁcially interfering signals whose power levels are weaker at longer distances from the transmitter becomes insigniﬁcant on degrading the Eve’s performance.  It is noteworthy to mention here that there is a clear trade-off between secrecy and reliability from one side and throughput from another side  i.e., secrecy increases as ζ decreases . However, the new degree of freedom resulted from the controllable selection process can bring more advantages in terms of providing more ﬂexibility to the OFDM design. More precisely, the subcarriers which are used to send AIS because of their low channel gains  which already limit the performance of both BER and throughput  can be deliberately ﬁlled with specially optimized signals that can fulﬁll other important functionalities  besides secrecy  such as reducing PAPR and OOBE.   42  J.

This enhancement is achieved without sharing secret keys nor knowing Eve’s channel nor even causing any major changes in the receiver design. Given the simplicity of the proposed design, its hardware testbed implementation is very handy to structure, making it very attractive for ﬂexible 5G and beyond systems and low-complexity Internet of Things  IoT  devices.  7 Conclusion  An enhanced physical layer security technique has been proposed for safeguarding OFDM-based transmission against eavesdropping. In this technique, named as OFDM-SIS-AIS, the secrecy performance of the recently proposed OFDM-SIS technique is boosted by injecting artiﬁciality interfering signals  AIS  in the subcar- riers that are not used for data transmission, resulting in a signiﬁcant improvement in the secrecy gap when TDD system is used. The presented analytical and simulation results have demonstrated the capability of the proposed schemes in achieving   Improving the Physical Layer Security of IoT-5G Systems  43  practical secrecy without increasing the complexity of the OFDM structure or knowing Eve’s channel, making it very suitable for low-complexity 5G-IoT and Tactile Internet applications. Future work can consider designing and investigating the secrecy performance of different variations of the proposed OFDM-SIS-AIS scheme assuming different subblock sizes and activation ratios.

They were typically implemented to attain the cause-effect relationships between nonlinear hydro-environmental processes  i.e., system identiﬁcation  and time series modeling hydro-meteorological variables that often cannot be modeled by classic statistical models such as autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous input  ARIMAX . A few studies are also available using AI methods as system identiﬁers of hydrological processes  e.g., [3, 4, 10, 11, 36, 38, 57] .  Most of the hydrological processes are known as highly nonlinear process that cannot be expressed in simple or complex mathematical forms [48]. To address such difﬁculty, AI-based modeling can be more effective than the probabilistic or distributed  physically based  models mainly because of  i  complex underling systems of the hydrological processes,  ii  unknown factors parameters involved in the processes,  iii  and spatiotemporal variation of the processes and their forcing  V.

Nourani et al.  factors. Some of the AI methods applied in hydrological studies include  but not limited to  artiﬁcial neural networks  ANNs, e.g., [1, 34, 35] , fuzzy logic  FL, e.g., [36, 45] , support vector regression  SVR, e.g., [8, 12] , and genetic programming  GP, e.g., [11, 27] .  ANNs, known as the universal approximator, have been widely used for mod- eling nonlinear hydrological processes over the past decades [5]. In general, the advantages of ANN models in comparison with other statistical and conceptual methods can be categorized as [39]:    Regarding to the black box feature of ANN models, the use of these models does  not require prior knowledge of the process.    Due to the application of a nonlinear ﬁlter, known as the activation function on  neurons, ANN models can handle the nonlinear properties of the process.    ANN models have the ability to apply multivariate inputs with different charac-  teristics.  The ability of ANN for linking input and output variables in complex hydrologi- cal systems without the need of prior knowledge about the nature of the process has led to a huge leap in the use of ANN models in hydrological simulations [2, 5, 13, 14, 22, 23, 32, 42].  In spite of popularity and capability of nonlinear modeling, ANNs suffer from some deﬁciencies when the interested hydrological process includes inadequate observed samples or the associated time series comprises high rate of non-stationary and seasonal variations [39]. To achieve reliable models and increase the accuracy of results, a number of data preprocessing approaches such as wavelet transform, season algorithm, singular spectrum analysis, and others have been developed and used in the hydrological modeling issues [8, 12, 39, 49]. The effectiveness of wavelet-based de-noising and multi-resolution analysis in optimizing AI models has been recently introduced and widely employed by the hydrologists to simulate different components of the hydrologic cycle such as rainfall-runoff, river ﬂow, groundwater, precipitation, and sedimentation [41]. For example, Kisi and Cimen [26] examined the efﬁciency of wavelet-SVR to one-day-ahead rainfall predicting in Turkey and demonstrated that the hybrid model can increase forecasting precision and performs superior than the stand-alone SVR and ANN models. Wavelet-based data preprocessing approach has also been employed to extract the seasonal features of the hydrological processes by decomposing the main time series into multi- scale sub-series, each representing a speciﬁc seasonal scale [3, 28]. Such studies showed that the data preprocessing by wavelet transform may improve the modeling efﬁciency over different time scales  both short and long terms . Corresponding improvement was found to be more sensible in large time scales such as seasonal or monthly, because in most of hydrological process, the seasonal  periodic  patterns in the large-scale time series are more dominant than that of the small-scale time series. In other words, the autoregressive property is more remarkable in small-scale hydrological time series  e.g., daily , whereas the seasonal speciﬁcation is more highlighted in large-scale time series  e.g., monthly   see [26, 49, 53] . However,   Emotional ANN  EANN : A New Generation of Neural Networks for. . .  47  it should be noted that such wavelet-based data processing scheme should be conducted within an external unit apart from the ANN’s framework.  2 Emotion in ANNs  Fellous is probably the ﬁrst researcher who stressed on the need for emotions in AI systems describing that the emotions must be dynamically interacted with together [18]. Emotion tends to be used in medical terminology for what a person is feeling at a given moment. Examples for emotion include joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise, pride, shame, regret, and elation. The ﬁrst six emotions are typically considered as the basic emotions, and the last four are treated as elaborations or specializations of them [6]. More recent descriptions either emphasized the external stimuli that trigger emotion or the internal responses involved in the emotional state, when in fact emotion includes both of those things and much more [25]. Perlovsky [43] deﬁnes emotion as the exaggeratedly expressive communications related to feelings. Love, hate, courage, fear, joy, sadness, pleasure, and disgust can all be described in both mental and physical terms. Emotion is the realm where thought and physiology are inextricably entwined, and where the self is inseparable from individual perceptions of value and judgment toward others and ourselves [6]. Emotions are sometimes considered as the antithesis of reason. A distinctive and challenging fact about human beings is a potential for both opposition and entanglement between will, emotion, and reason [25]. According to Khashman [25] researchers and scientists studied the role of emotions in artiﬁcial intelligence  AI  from a variety of viewpoints: to develop agents and robots that interact more gracefully with humans, to develop systems that use the analog of emotions to aid their own reasoning, or to create agents or robots that more closely model human emotional interactions and learning [29]. Although computers do not have physiologies like humans, information signals and regulatory signals travel within them. According to Picard [44], “There will be functions in an intelligent complex adaptive system, that have to respond to unpredictable, complex information that play the role that emotions play in people. Therefore, for computers to respond to complex affective signals in a real-time way, they will need something like the systems we have, which we call emotions.” Such computers will have the same emotional functionality, but not the same emotional mechanisms as human emotions [25, 44].  Recent studies have shown that scientists attempt to integrate the artiﬁcial emo- tion into the ANN in order to solve complex engineering problems via emotional ANN  EANN  models. From the biological standpoint, the mood and emotion of animal due to the activity of hormone glands can affect neurophysiological response of the animal, sometimes by providing different actions for a similar task at different moods [37]. Similarly for an EANN, there will be a feedback loop between the hormonal and neural systems; each is inﬂuenced by the other which in turn, the learning ability of the network is relatively enhanced. Over the past decades, a few   48  V. Nourani et al.  kinds of EANNs have been developed and suggested. They have their own merits and features. For instance, Moren [33] proposed brain emotional learning  BEL - based ANN inspired by some biological evidences that an emotional stimulus  such as fear  can be processed more quickly than a regular stimulus through available shorter routes in the emotional brain to act fast when the logical mind does not have enough time for processing an external situation  such as danger .  BEL networks have been efﬁciently used by Rahman et al. [46] to control interior permanent magnet synchronous motor drive. Khashman [25] considered emotional anxiety and conﬁdence factors to modify back propagation  BP  learning algorithm of the multilayer perceptron  MLP  networks. The author developed emotional back propagation  EmBP  neural network in which anxiety factor was initialized according to the pattern of input samples, and then it was modiﬁed through the process of iteration. In a contrary manner, conﬁdence factor was related to the anxiety factor as well as the network output at the ﬁrst iteration. In the beginning of the network training, the anxiety and conﬁdence levels were found high and low, respectively, but they received optimal values after a few iterations. Within the training procedure of EmBP, assigning a high value to the anxiety factor forces the network to have less attention to the derivative of the errors  error gradient  in the network’s output. However the rise of conﬁdence factor  due to stress reduction  dictates the network to pay more heed to the alteration of the weights in the previous training step. In fact, the procedure was similar to the magniﬁcation of inertia term to moderate the alteration degree from a pattern to the other as the learning iteration is progressed [37]. In the studies by Lotﬁ and Akbarzadeh [30, 31], BEL, EmBP, and some other emotional concepts were conjugated in order to develop some EANNs for clustering, pattern recognition, and predication tasks. From the mathematical perspective and apart from the biological concepts, with regard to the conventional ANN, an EANN includes a few extra parameters which are dynamically interacted with inputs, outputs, and statistical weights of the network [37]. Returning to the hydro-environmental studies, Nourani [37] demonstrated the ﬁrst application of EANN in which the author proposed the revised BP algorithm to train MLP networks by incorporating emotional anxiety concept. The new algorithm was used to solve streamﬂow forecasting problem when there is lack of long-observed training time series. Details of this pioneer study are described in the following section after a brief overview on the structure of EANN and its difference with classic ANN.  3 Difference Between EANN and Simple ANN  Feed-forward neural networks  FFNN  are of the most popular ANN structures extensively applied to model different components of the hydrologic cycle [4, 13]. A FFNN with three layers of input, output, and hidden, trained by BP algorithm, has shown appropriate efﬁciency in nonlinear hydrological modeling tasks [5, 20].   49   1   Emotional ANN  EANN : A New Generation of Neural Networks for. . .  Figure 1 shows a schematic of a three-layered FFNN, and the explicit equation to calculate the target of such FFNN can be written as [40]:   cid:16 yj = fj  wj h × fh  whi xi + whb  + wj b   cid:17   m cid:18  h=1   cid:14   n cid:18  i=1   cid:15    cid:19   where i, h, j, b, and w indicate, respectively, neurons of the input, hidden, and output layers and bias and applied weight  or bias  by the neuron; fh and fj show activation functions of hidden layer and output layer, respectively; xi, n, and m represent, respectively, input value, input, and hidden neuron numbers; and y and  cid:16 yj denote the observed and calculated target values, respectively. In the calibration phase of the model, the values of hidden and output layers and corresponding weights could be varied and calibrated.  On the other hand, an EANN model is the improved version of a conventional ANN including an emotional system which emits artiﬁcial hormones to modulate the operation of each neuron, and in a feedback loop, the hormonal parameters are also adjusted by inputs and output of the neuron. The schematic of an inner neuron from FFNN and EANN has been depicted in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively.  By comparing these two neurons, it is deduced that in contrast to the FFNN in which the information ﬂows only in the forward direction, a neuron of EANN can reversibly get and give information from inputs and outputs and also can provide hormones  e.g., Ha, Hb, and Hc . These hormones as dynamic coefﬁcients are initialized according to the pattern of input  and target  samples and then are modiﬁed through the training iterations. Through training phase they can impact on all components of the neuron  i.e., weights, I; net function, II; and activation  Fig. 1 Schematic of a three layer FFNN model   50  Fig. 2 A node of EANN and emotional unit [37]  V. Nourani et al.  function, III, in Fig. 2 . In Fig. 2 the solid and dotted lines, respectively, show neural and hormonal routes of information. The output of ith neuron in an EANN with three hormonal glands of Ha, Hb, and Hc can be computed as [37]:   cid:14    cid:20   Yi =  γi +  cid:18   ∂i,hHh  × f  βi +  cid:18   χi,hHh   cid:15    cid:23    cid:15    cid:23    cid:18    cid:14   ⎡  ⎣  j   cid:20   ⎛  ⎝   cid:15    cid:5  + Xi,j  cid:23    cid:14    cid:20    cid:21  cid:22  h 2  μi +  cid:18   h  ψi,hHh  cid:21  cid:22  4  ]   cid:23    cid:21  cid:22  h 1  ×  αi,j +  cid:18    cid:14    cid:20   h   cid:10 i,j,kHh  cid:21  cid:22  3   cid:15    2   where the artiﬁcial hormones are computed as [37]:  Hh =  cid:18   Hi.h  i   h = a, b, c    3    cid:28   In Eq. 2, term  1  shows the imposed weight to the activation function  f  . It includes the statistic  constant  neural weight of γ i as well as dynamic hormonal h ∂i,hHh. Term  2  stands for the imposed weight to the summation weight of  net  function. Term  3  shows imposed weight to the Xi,j  an input from jth node of former layer , and term  4  shows the bias of the summation function, including both neural and hormonal weights of μi and  h ψi,hHh, respectively.  The contribution of overall hormonal level of EANN  i.e., Hh  among the hormones should be controlled by ∂i,h, χ i,h, Φi,j,k and ψ i,h factors which in turn, the i th node output  Yi  will provide hormonal feedback of Hi,h to the network as [37]:   cid:28    Emotional ANN  EANN : A New Generation of Neural Networks for. . .  Hi,h = glandityi,h  × Yi  51   4   where the glandity factor should be calibrated in the training phase of EANN to provide appropriate level of hormone to the glands. Different schemes may be used to initialize the hormonal values of Hh according to the input samples, e.g., mean of input vector of learning samples. Thereafter considering the network output  Yi  and Eqs. 2 and 3, the hormonal values are updated through the learning process to get appropriate match between observed and computed time series of the target.  4 Application of EANN for Hydrological Modeling  As previously mentioned, Nourani [37] proposed EANN model to simulate rainfall- runoff process in two watersheds, namely, Lobbs Hole Creek in Australia and Moselle River in France. The study incorporated emotional anxiety into a FFBP structure and investigated its efﬁciency using different efﬁciency measures including root-mean-square error  RMSE , determination coefﬁcient  DC , and determination coefﬁcient for peak values  DCpeak . To assess the capability of modeling with limited observed time series, the author developed three different scenarios  i.e., strategy1, strategy2, and strategy3  in which the EANN was trained and validated by different size of training and validation samples.  The ﬁrst case study was demonstrated using observe data from Lobbs Hole Creek, a sub-basin of Murrumbidgee in Australia, and the second was shown using data from Moselle River catchment, a sub-basin of river Rhine in France. The selected watersheds had two distinct climatic conditions showing quite different hydrological behavior and response to the rainfall. The Lobbs Hole Creek is upstream of the main river including mountainous and hilly regions and experi- encing irregular precipitation pattern over a year with higher coefﬁcient of variation  because of higher ﬂuctuations of the observed data . However, Moselle watershed experiences a well-dominated seasonal weather with a larger area.  Different data division strategies were assumed to evaluate the overall perfor- mance and also efﬁciency of models to estimate peak discharge values. To this end, the ﬁrst 75%, 50%, and 40% of data samples were considered as training data sets at the strategies1, strategies2, and strategies13, respectively. By decreasing the number of training samples, the generalization of the resultant network to predict the unseen data sets was foun d as a challenging task. Furthermore, due to importance of multi- step-ahead forecasts of the hydro-environmental processes, already pointed out by some studies  e.g., [7] , 2-, 4-, and 7-day-ahead predictions of the process were performed and compared as well as single-step-ahead forecasting scenario.  The rainfall value at time t  Rt  and current and antecedent runoff values  Qt, Qt−1, ..., Qt-p  were imposed to the FFBP and EANN to predict runoff value one-d- ahead  Qt + 1  as the network output. Since the effect of antecedent rainfall values is implicitly considered by antecedent runoff values, only Rt was entered to the   52  V. Nourani et al.  networks as a potential input. Therefore the general mathematical formulation of the networks could be expressed as:  Qt+k = fn   cid:6  Qt , Qt−1, Qt−2, . . . , Qt−p, Rt   cid:7    5  in which fn denotes the FFBP or EANN and k = 1 for single-step-ahead forecasting and k = 2, 4, and 7 for multi-step-ahead forecasts. Selection of appropriate architecture of the network, i.e., appropriate lag No. of p  No. of neurons in input layer will be p + 1 , hidden layer No., and optimal iteration epoch No., is a key issue in any training task which can prevent the network from the overtraining problem. Considering tangent sigmoid and pure line as activation functions of hidden and output layers, respectively, the FFBPs were trained using Levenberg-Marquardt scheme of BP algorithm [19], and the best structure and epoch number of each network were determined through trial-error procedure. Also for EANN model, hormones as dynamic coefﬁcients are initialized according to the pattern of input  and target  samples and then are modiﬁed through the training iterations. Through training phase, they can impact on all components of the neuron  i.e., weights, net function, and activation function .  Overall comparison of the results denotes superiority of the EANN over FFBP in rainfall-runoff modeling of both watersheds. According to higher coefﬁcient of variation  because of higher ﬂuctuations of the observed data  for the observed rainfall and runoff time series of the Lobbs Hole Creek watershed due to the hydro-geomorphologic condition, this watershed has a wild hydro-climatic regime with regard to the Moselle watershed. Therefore for Lobbs Hole Creek watershed, the performance of both models is lower as compared to the Moselle watershed. However this difference between modeling performances of two watersheds using EANN is relatively lower than the FFBP modeling. The results are listed below:  1. Computed values of DCpeak  see Table 1  indicate the ability of EANN to catch the peak values of hydrographs better than FFBP in both watersheds. Since autoregressive models, according to the Markovian property of a process, consider states of the process at some previous time steps to predict the state of system at the next time step, they usually underestimate the peak values which occurred due to instantaneous imposition of an external force  intensive rainfall  to the system. In this condition, the system is experiencing an emotional situation which is different from normal conditions of the system. Therefore in the training phase, a hormone of the emotional unit of EANN acts as a dynamic weight to recurrently gives the feedback to other components of the network and regulates the model for the emotional situation. In the mathematical point of view, such dynamical weights are activated in extraordinary situations  e.g., intensive rainfall  and affect and magnify the weights of network, all done within the EANN framework without any need to external data processing approach.  2. The obtained results by data division strategies of 2 and 3 presented in Table 1 showed that EANN can be trained efﬁciently even in the presence of the sparse training data sets. In the Lobbs Hole River, the strategies 2 and 3 reulted in 1.4%   Emotional ANN  EANN : A New Generation of Neural Networks for. . .  53  k a e P C D  y f i r e V  6 4 . 0  3 4 . 0  1 4 . 0  7 6 . 0  3 6 . 0  1 6 . 0  1 8 . 0  9 7 . 0  9 7 . 0  9 . 0  2 8 . 0  4 8 . 0  y f i r e V  3 0 2 0  .  4 1 3 0  .  4 8 1 0  .  2 8 1 0  .  2 1 2 0  .  3 2 0  .  8 3 0 0 0  .  1 4 0 0 0  .  2 4 0 0 0  .  4 2 0 0 0  .  4 2 0 0 0  .  6 2 0 0 0  .  n i a r T  2 2 1 0  .  1 4 1 0  .  1 1 0  .  1 9 0 0  .  3 0 1 0  .  7 0 1 0  .  7 3 0 0 0  .  4 0 0 0  .  2 3 0 0 0  .  2 0 0 0  .  2 2 0 0 0  .  8 1 0 0 0  .    d e z i l a m r o n    E S M R  y f i r e V  8 4 6 0  .  4 5 4 0  .  6 0  .  4 7 0  .  4 7 0  .  7 0  .  5 8 0  .  3 2 8 0  .  2 9 0  .  1 9 0  .  8 0  .  n i a r T  1 0 7 0  .  2 8 6 0  .  1 4 7 0  .  1 9 7 0  .  4 6 7 0  .  8 7 7 0  .  2 7 8 0  .  1 5 8 0  .  1 3 9 0  .  9 8 0  .  3 9 0  .

Nourani et al.  and 5.7% reduction in the performance of the EANN. Regardin the results of the same strategies in the Moselle Rivere, 1% and 2.2% performance reduction were obtained. Based on the FFBP modelling results, the performance reduction values were 8.5% and 32% for the Lobbs Hole River and 3.5% and 6.3% for the Moselle River. The FFBP even shows overtraining alert for Lobbs Hole Creek watershed in strategy 3. However during FFBP training, the network does not consider the difference between the system’s situations, and therefore when the statistical weights of network start to be trained using the ordinary situation data of system  e.g., base ﬂow data of river, observed at the outlet of watershed , sudden appearance of severe rainfall values in the input layer can alter the trained weights, and then again this confusion continues by returning the system to the ordinary state. This is the main reason that usually FFBPs need long data set to be trained appropriately. The aforementioned obtained results approve the efﬁciency of EANN with regard to conventional FFBP model when it is trained using relatively fewer data samples.  3. Although both FFBP and EANN models are interpolators and must experience critical and extreme conditions in the training phase, the results indicated that EANN is capable of producing more reliable predictions for the unseen data samples. In other words, ENN can generate better estimations using less observed extreme values.  4. Since the ability of a forecasting model to provide a useful horizon of forecasts is a crucial task in hydrological modeling, several lead times of runoff time series  i.e., 2, 4, and 7 d of lead time  were also considered as the networks’ outputs to evaluate and compare the performance of FFBP and EANN models in multi-step-ahead runoff forecasts. The results of multi-step-ahead forecasting obtained via FFBP and EANN models with data division strategies of 1 and 3 have been presented in Table 2 for both watersheds. It should be noticed that the outputs of multi-step-ahead models were Qt+2, Qt+4 and Qt+7, and only the results of the best networks have been presented in the table. As the results show, by increasing the forecast horizon, the performance of both FFBP and EANN models is decreased mostly due to the magniﬁcation of the forecast noise at each forecasting time step. However again, it is clear that the performance of EANN in multi-step-ahead forecasting is relatively better than FFBP model about 10% in average. According to the presented results in Table 2, although by decreasing the number of training samples the training efﬁciency is increased, the veriﬁcation performance for unseen data is remarkably decreased, and the difference between calibration and veriﬁcation DCs is increased.  At the ﬁrst glance, it brings to mind that EANN is structurally more complicated than FFBP, but actually the EANN with only a few hormonal parameters could lead to better outcomes without the need for any external data processing operation. Even though, in some cases the best structure of trained EANN contains fewer input neurons than FFBP which makes the EANN more comparable with the FFBP model from structural simplicity point of view  see Table 1 .

Nourani et al.  Brieﬂy, through the comparison of the proposed EANN and conventional FFBP models, two main objectives were targeted. Firstly to address the deﬁciency of network training in the lack of long training time series, three data division strategies with different sizes of training points were considered for the training purpose. The outcomes showed the ability of EANN to cope with the lack of long observed data used for network training. Secondly in the multi-step-ahead forecasting task, the obtained results indicated better performance of EANN than FFBP so that for 2, 4, and 7 d forecasts via EANN model, the reductions of forecasting performance of test data with regard to single-step-ahead forecasting were 2%, 4%, and 8.2% and 2.1%, 7.6%, and 14%, respectively, for the Lobbs Hole and Moselle watersheds. These reductions were 5%, 6.2%, and 15.4% and 5.9%, 11.8%, and 18% for the FFBP model. Overall, the comparison of experimental results shows the merits of EANN in the mentioned tasks of rainfall-runoff modeling with regard to the FFBP model. In contrast to the statistical weights of network, emotional parameters of an EANN dynamically get give information from to inputs and outputs of the network at each time step to distinguish the dry  e.g., rainless d  and wet  e.g., stormy d  situations of the system. Both watersheds studied in this research are almost free from remarkable anthropogenic inﬂuences. Clearly just like any other data-driven time series forecasting method, the performance of the EANN can be affected in presence of anthropogenic and or climatic inﬂuences and shifts of the observed time series. In the presence of such shifts or strong non-stationary of time series, reliable data preprocessing approaches may be employed prior to performing the forecasts. Such a reliable implementation of EANN in rainfall-runoff modeling offers its application to model other hydrological processes  e.g., sediment load, groundwater, precipitation, etc.  at different time scales  e.g., daily, monthly, and annual . According to the importance of accurate predictions of hydro-climatologic events  stressed by [55] , the proposed EANN model may be used to create ensemble extreme predictions at multiple lead times. The employed model in this study was a typical form of EANN among broad classes of EANNs trained by BP algorithm; future studies may focus on evaluating other types of EANNs and other training algorithms  e.g., metaheuristic approaches  in hydrological modeling.  More recently Sharghi et al. [51] implemented EANN to model Markovian and seasonal rainfall-runoff process in West Nishnabotna and Trinity Rivers in the USA  sub-basin in California, USA . The authors compared the prediction accuracy of EANN with those of FFNN and wavelet-ANN in terms of different statistical measures and demonstrated that for daily modeling, EANN outperforms the counterparts, especially for the Trinity River. By contrast, the results showed that wavelet-ANN is superior for monthly rainfall-runoff modeling.

Many of the initial developments toward the IoTs have focused on the combination of Auto-ID and networked infrastructures in business-to-business logistics and product life cycle applications [54]. Regarding the application of IoT in hydro-environmental studies, our review showed that only a few researches considered the IoT in their studies although web services as an online repository of historical and real-time hydrological data such as runoff, rainfall, streamﬂow, and groundwater level are available for more than a decade. However, it must be mentioned that geographical information systems  GIS , remote sensing  RS , and data storage systems were applied frequently in the hydro-environmental studies such as ﬂood forecasting, ﬂood hazard mapping, as well as climate change studies  e.g., [9, 50] .  One of the earlier studies in the application of the IoT in the wide range of hydro-environmental studies was carried out by Xiaoying and Huanyan [56]. The authors developed a wetland monitoring system on the basis of real-time, remote, and automatically monitored data in which wireless sensor networks and communication systems were used. The study showed that the new system may provide accurate sampling data that is important for conservation of wetlands. In the preliminary study of possible applications of IoT, Khan et al. [24] reported some applications in hydro-environment such as prediction of natural disasters and water scarcity detection at different places. The combination of sensors and their autonomous coordination and with the relevant modeling tools, one may predict the occurrence of natural disasters and take appropriate actions in advance. In addition, such network may be used to alert the users of a stream or water supply pipelines, for instance, when an upstream event such as the accidental release of sewage into the stream might have dangerous issues for downstream users. In a similar study, Dlodlo and Kalezhi [15] studied the potential applications of the IoT in environmental man- agement in South Africa. The authors categorized IoT applications into four broad classes of environmental quality and protection management, oceans and coasts management, climate change adaptation, biodiversity, and conservation and envi- ronmental awareness. The results indicated that integrating IoT into environmental management in South Africa has likely more enhanced impact. Environmental IoT together with 1-year meteorological measurements was employed by Du et al. [16] to investigate the characterization of atmospheric visibility and its relationship with the variables comprising precipitation, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction at Xiamen, China. The study demonstrated that an optimal regression model can moderately simulate atmosphere visibility which provides new insights to its characteristics and forcing meteorological factors. Fang et al. [17] focused on the integration of RS data, GIS, and global positioning system with IoT and cloud services to develop snowmelt ﬂood early-warning system for a case study catchment in Xinjiang, China. The results revealed that the process of snowmelt   58  V. Nourani et al.  ﬂood simulation and early warning are greatly beneﬁted by such an integrated system. Rathore et al. [47] proposed a hybrid IoT-based system for smart city development and urban planning using Big Data analytics that consists of various types of sensors deployment including smart home sensors, vehicular networking, weather and water sensors, smart parking sensors, surveillance objects, etc. The authors reported that weather and water information may increase the efﬁciency of the smart city by providing the associated data such as temperature, rain, humidity, pressure, wind speed and water levels at rivers, lakes, dams, and other reservoirs. All the information is gathered by placing the sensors in the reservoirs and other open places. Using rain-measuring sensors and snow-melting parameters, they were able to predict ﬂoods and water demands to the residents of the city. More recently, Shenan et al. [52] developed software and hardware in IoT environment to manage light, temperature, and soil water content in a greenhouse system. The authors used FL to monitor and manage the entire process in the system and showed that the single -code fuzzy controllers reside in single microcontroller chip may keep the practicality of the system. Most recently, González-Briones et al. [21] developed an innovative multicomponent system that uses information from wireless sensor networks for knowledge discovery  from weather and terrain conditions  and decision-making in both micro- and macroscale irrigation projects. The use of IoT was improved the efﬁciency of water use and optimized irrigation system in comparison to a traditional automatic systems.  With respect to the aforementioned review, the present study shows the lack of studies toward the integration of rapidly developing IoT technologies with hydrological modeling techniques, particularly artiﬁcial intelligence methods. To increase the efﬁciency of rainfall-runoff models for many applications in practice, one way may be the integration of IoT with the state-of-the-art EANN that has not been explored so far.

Smart Tourism Destination in Smart Cities Paradigm: A Model for Antalya  Gözdegül Ba¸ser, O˘guz Do˘gan, and Fadi Al-Turjman  1 Introduction  Emerging technologies inﬂuence tourism destinations and cause new challenges arising from changes in both consumers and the environment. The use of tech- nology in a destination can enrich tourist experiences and enhance destination competitiveness as well as enable new distribution channels and create a new business environment [1, 2]. Technology provides interconnection of services as well as supplying information for planning, organizing, and evaluating data. Therefore, technology has emerged as the driving and fundamental force for tourism destinations. Tourism industry is one of the ﬁrst service industries to adapt and use information and communication technologies  ICT  for promoting its services [2]. However, tourism is not a clear-cut sector but an all-embracing and pervasive domain of service and industrial activities  [3], 2001, p. 5 . Tourism services are mostly interconnected and include a wide range of inputs and outputs in tourism destinations. Technology has started to play an important role to interconnect touristic services. As a result, the digital technology has become an important element for the promotion and distribution of tourism’s services [4].  In order to deal with these challenges, ﬁrst destinations have to recognize the kind of changes that occurred and proactively respond to the changes [1]. Implementing technological tools within tourism destinations has become critical since the connected, better informed, and engaged tourists are dynamically interacting with the destination [5]. UNESCO and WTO have certainly indicated that countries need  G. Ba¸ser   cid:2   · O. Do˘gan · F.

Ba¸ser et al.  to respond to new tourists’ demands, and this response can be achieved by using innovative techniques offered by digitalization or new technology [6].  Tourists have different needs, expectations, and characteristics, and they prefer different types of tourism. Tourism destination covers interconnected services and tangible and intangible products and services. Smart tourism destination is a new but rapidly developing concept which needs considerable attention. This paper seeks to clarify the conceptualization of smart tourism destination and its link with the smart city concept as well as proposing a model for the smart city case study here in Antalya.  2 Smartness, Smart City, and Smart Tourism Destination  The notion of smartness ﬁnds its origin in the 1990s, although it proliferated signiﬁcantly after 2008 [7]. Initially, the concept was coined as a complex tech- nological infrastructure, embedded within urban areas to foster economic, social, and environmental prosperity [8]. More speciﬁcally, it posited the integration of ICT to improve processes and interconnect sub-systems [9] to ultimately tackle the economic, social, and environmental challenges imposed by urbanism [10]. Urbanism and managing big cities have enabled the smart city concept. A smart city is a city that uses advanced information and communication technology  ICT  to optimize resource production and consumption [11]. The concept of the smart city represents an environment where technology is embedded within the city. This technology will synergize with city’s social components in order to improve citizens’ quality of life, while also improving city services efﬁciencies such as optimizing the use of energy and better trafﬁc monitoring [12]. The ultimate goal of smart places is to enhance the quality of life of all stakeholders, including residents and tourists [10].  Smartness is centered on a user perspective, which makes it more user-friendly than intelligent [1]. The term has been added to cities  smart city  to describe efforts aimed at using technologies innovatively to achieve resource optimization, effective and fair governance, sustainability, and quality of life [13]. The concept of the smart city represents an environment where technology is embedded within the city. This technology synergizes with city’s social components in order to improve citizens’ quality of life while also improving city services efﬁciencies, such as optimizing the use of energy and better trafﬁc monitoring [1]. In connection with physical infrastructure  smart home, smart factory , the focus is on blurring the lines between the physical and the digital and on fostering technology integration. Added to technologies  smartphone, smart card, smart TV, etc. , it describes multi- functionality and high levels of connectivity. In addition, a smart city uses digital technologies to enhance performance and well-being, reduce costs and resource consumption, and engage more effectively and actively with its citizens.  Analyzing the concept of smart city, Cohen [14] deﬁned the Smart City Wheel dimensions as  1  smart governance that relates with aspect of transparency with   Smart Tourism Destination in Smart Cities Paradigm: A Model for Antalya  65  Fig. 1 [!b] Cohen’s  2012  Smart City Wheel [14]  Smart  Governance  Smart Living  Smart  Environment  Smart People  Smart  Mobility  Smart  Economy  governance systems through modernization of city administration by supporting data openness and public involvement;  2  smart environment which is related to energy optimization that leads to sustainable management of available resources;  3  smart mobility which referred to accessibility within the city as well as outside the city and availability of modern transportation systems;  4  smart economy which is related to implementation of economic strategies based around digital technology;  5  smart people which linked to the qualiﬁcation level of city’s human capital; and  6  smart living which involves the quality of life which is measured in terms of healthy environment, social cohesion, tourist attraction, and availability of cultural and educational services  Fig. 1 .  Smart city intertwines many entities to each other and therefore needs coordi- nation, information, and infrastructure. Komninos et al. [15] indicate the base of the smart city as human capital, infrastructure infostructure, and information. A well-structured smart city design is expected to support smart tourism destination as infrastructure and operation planning in the Internet of Things  IoT  era.  Smart city applications of the IoT involve large-scale deployments of wireless sensor networks  WSNs  which have gained lots of research attention in recent times. The SmartSantander project in Spain is an example of one such city-scale research project involving the deployment of over 3000 sensor and relay nodes within the city, supporting multiple applications [16]. Environmental monitoring, outdoor parking area management, and park and garden irrigation are some of the many use cases being tested on the IoT test-bed deployed in the city. The Santander project and other such smart city projects  F. Al-Turjman, et al., [17]  have provided a platform for researchers to experiment with the routing protocols, network coding schemes, and data mining techniques in a large-scale, multiuser application platform   66  G. Ba¸ser et al.  for sensor networks. The sensor network has to deal with large amounts of data, support requests from multiple users, and support information extraction from the network rather than serving as point-to-point communication network and transmit data from multiple information sources to the sink. Such a framework supports different types of users as the IoT user base, including individual users, private data centers, and government agencies. These users interact with the sensor network through an Internet-based interface access network, which is perceived to be an information-centric network  ICN  in the future [18–22]. Data gathered from the sensor network is delivered to the interface access network through gateway nodes. These gateway nodes could either communicate directly with the sink node of the sensor network or could be distributed throughout the network to provide multiple access points. Currently, the experiments are focused on enabling each application as a separate entity. However, in the real world, many of the applications run simultaneously, and the network receives requests from multiple end users in IoT user base at the same time. For example, in a smart city application, the same infrastructure  sensor and relay nodes  that is used in periodic monitoring of trafﬁc intensity is also used for outdoor parking area management and to provide information about trafﬁc congested areas to users on demand. It can even be used to send out high-priority alerts about hazardous road conditions or accidents to users. The information generated by each of these request types has different attributes associated with it. While the periodic monitoring information needs to be reliable, it does not have a strict upper bound on the time taken to gather and deliver the data, as long as it happens before the end of the stipulated time period. However, for on-demand requests generated by the user, such as a user requesting to know the availability of a free parking space in a region, the information has to be delivered quickly  low latency  to the user. In case of emergency alerts, the information must be transmitted reliably and as quickly as possible, to all users in the area. This shows that the sensor network must be able to segregate the requests and manage the heterogeneous trafﬁc ﬂows in a way that satisﬁes the end user in terms of the perceived quality of information for each request type. Latency, reliability, accuracy, relevance, and robustness are some of the attributes that collectively provide an estimate of the quality of information  QoI  perceived by the user [18–22]. To enable such QoI-aware data delivery, the use of artiﬁcial intelligence  AI  cognition approaches in the underlying sensor network is recommended [23–25] – [18–22]. Cognition refers to the ability to be aware of the environment, in addition to be able to learn from the past actions and use it in making future decisions that beneﬁt the network [23–25] – [18–22] .  Smart tourism destination initiates back to the developments in technology starting with digitalization. Digitalization in tourism has initiated since the 1950s as being parallel to the advances in technology. Broadly speaking, digital tourism is concerned with the use of digital technologies to enhance the tourist experience before, during, and after the tourist activity [26]. Lopez de Avila [27] deﬁnes smart tourism destination as an innovative tourist destination, built on an infrastructure of state-of-the-art technology guaranteeing the sustainable development of tourist areas, accessible to everyone, which facilitates the visitor’s interaction with and   Smart Tourism Destination in Smart Cities Paradigm: A Model for Antalya  67  integration into his or her surroundings, increasing the quality of the experience at the destination and improves residents’ quality of life.  Digital tourism focuses on a wide variety of tourist activities in destinations, e.g., museums, transportation systems, concerts, activities, rallies, countrysides, zoos, theme parks, etc. [4]. Tourism apps, events information, accommodation reservation platforms, tourist card, online tickets, integration of cards, and platforms with other services are some components of smart tourism initiatives. Younger tourists and tourists with higher incomes tend to use e-services more intensively [28]. In this regard, digitalization, namely, e-tourism, provides some advantages like the reduction of seasonality, the more successful communication with the customers, and the rise in reservations and sales in general  [29], p. 336 .  In addition to the rapid developments in digitalization, tourism services still experience very relevant changes [30], due to the unprecedented development of information and communication technology  ICT  in recent decades [28]. ICTs create value-added experiences for tourists [1] and new opportunities for marketing and distribution strategies for tourism providers [28]. From the supply of products to information search process and consumption patterns, tourism experiences and their preparations can be progressively transformed by advances in ICT [31]. In regard to smart tourism destination, smart city concept is required to be considered as many applications either coincide or complete each other. Both smart tourism destination and smart city concepts aim to achieve a better service for tourists and local people by providing fast, reliable, and rich information and practices.  Basing on the smart city concept, smart tourism destination contributes to the value creation through collecting, sharing, and organizing data supported by the smart city infrastructure. This infrastructure resembles an ecosystem in which stakeholders interact with each other continuously. Therefore, the ecosystem approach has been recognized as suitable to address the topics of smart cities and smart tourism destinations methodologically [11, 13, 32]. The ecosystem in the smart tourism destination provides tourists with real-time and personal services and simultaneously collects data for the optimization of their strategic and operational management [11, 13, 33]. From the smart destination  SD  logic perspective, an ecosystem has been outlined as a relatively self-contained, self-adjusting system of resource-integrating actors connected through shared institutional logics and mutual value creation through voluntary service exchange  [34], p. 15 . In this respect, the tourist can collect information, before, during, and after the visit [35]. Also, developments in geographical information systems  GIS  have created new opportunities for tourism marketing and promotion [36]. Smart tourism destinations take advantage of  1  technology-embedded environments,  2  responsive processes at micro and macro levels,  3  end-user devices in multiple touch points, and  4  engaged stakeholders that use the platform dynamically as a neural system  [1], p. 557 .  Smart cities can be stated as the seed of smart destinations. However, there are  important differences between the terms:   68  Fig. 2 Smart tourism components  G. Ba¸ser et al.  Smart experience  Smart business ecosystem  Smart destination    The main target audience of a smart destination is the tourist not so much the locals. In essence, smart cities and smart destinations share infrastructure as well as facilities while providing solutions to locals and tourists. Therefore, multilingualism, cultural differences, culinary uses, the seasonality of the visiting population, etc. should be taken into consideration [37].    A smart destination is driven by the tourism sector and public as well as private institutions. Its governance is shared through the formation of inclusive entities such as boards, trusts, foundations, etc.    Smart destinations are bound to the increase in their competitiveness and to the  improvement of the tourist experience.  Smart tourism has three basic components such as smart experience, smart business ecosystem, and smart destination. The smart experience component specif- ically focuses on technology-mediated tourism experiences and their enhancement through personalization, context awareness, and real-time monitoring Buhalis and Amaranggana  2014 . In a smart tourism ecosystem, any type of stakeholder can become a producer, consumer, intermediary, etc. depending on resources and connections rather than predeﬁned roles [11, 13]. Enabling tourism destination managers to understand the importance of integrating smartness for value co- creation can enhance competitiveness  [5], p. 109   Fig. 2 .  Furthermore, smart tourism destinations can be structured as having six A’s as  1  attractions which can be natural such as mountain, artiﬁcial such as amusement parks, or cultural such as a music festival;  2  accessibility which refers to the entire transportation system within the destination that comprises of available routes, exist- ing terminals, and adequate public transportations;  3  amenities which characterize all services facilitating a convenient stay, namely, accommodation, gastronomy, and leisure activities;  4  available packages which refer to the availability of service bundles by intermediaries to direct tourists’ attention to certain unique features of a respective destination;  5  activities which refer to all available activities at the destination which mainly trigger tourists to visit the destination; and  6  ancillary services which are those daily use services which are not primarily aimed for tourists such as bank, postal service, and hospital [38]. Destinations need to interconnect all their stakeholders to facilitate a dynamic co-creation process to increase destination competitiveness [39]. Smart tourism destination may cover the   Smart Tourism Destination in Smart Cities Paradigm: A Model for Antalya  69  Fig. 3 6 A’s of smart tourism destination  Ancillary  services  Accessibility  Activities  Amenities  Attractions  Smart Tourism  Destination  Available  packages  following applications appropriate for the six A’s before, during, and after the visit of the tourist  Fig. 3 .  3 Smart Tourism Destination Instruments and Platforms  The instruments and platforms required to develop a smart tourist destination include the following: [6]  1. ICT: The key aspect of smart destinations is the integration of ICTs into physical infrastructure [1]. ICT could contribute in terms of generating value-added experiences for tourists, while also improving efﬁciency and supporting process automation for the related organizations  11, 13], p. 180 . One of the basic changes of digital tourism is the opportunity it creates for tourists to design their own tours and seek out destinations, hotels, ﬂights, etc. upon their individual preferences through Internet access. According to the “World Travel Trends – 2016” report, the Internet is far and away the best tool in travel searching [40]. Tourists browse the Internet to collect traveling information and visit related tourism destination’s website which becomes a very useful tool to promote tourism by giving important information for visitors [4]. With 60% of leisure and 41% of business travelers making their travel arrangements via the Internet [41], the Internet has become one of the most important communication tools for tourists as well as tourism providers [42]. Da Costa Liberato et al. [6] claim that   70  G. Ba¸ser et al.  travel trends over the next few years will be determined by the intensive use of the Internet.  2. Cloud computing: The use of cloud computing could reduce ﬁxed costs and shift them into variable costs based on the necessities. It also stimulates information sharing that is fundamental to undertake smart destinations.  3. Internet of Things  IoT : IoT is a network that connects anything in anytime and anyplace in order to identify, locate, manage, and monitor smart objects [43]. The recent technological development, however, has enabled the rise of Internet of Things paradigm, in which devices are connected to the Internet, currently allowing 1.6 billion people to have constant access to information [44]. The IoT is a combination of people, processes, data, and everything that makes networks more relevant and valuable than ever before, turning information into actions that create new resources, richer experiences, and unprecedented economic opportunities for companies, individuals, and countries [6]. The IoT could support smart destinations in terms of providing information and analysis as well as automation and control. The process of applying IoT to tourism has to undergo several stages, namely, tourism infrastructure construction, tourism information data construction, and tourism service platform construction. Ultimately, the uniﬁed information platform, which will support tourism operation monitoring and automated management, is created [45]. The basic idea of the IoT is the pervasive presence around us of a variety of objects such as radio-frequency identiﬁcation  RFID  tags, sensors, actuators, mobile devices, etc. which are able to interact with each other and cooperate with their neighboring objects to achieve common goals [46].  4. End-user Internet service systems: It refers to a number of applicants at various levels supported by a combination of cloud computing and IoT [6]. End- user Internet service systems include the websites and social media platforms. The websites of tourism destinations grant detailed information about tourism products and services of the location, reduction in dependence to agents, ability to compare alternative products and services during decision-making phase, making reservations directly, and buying the product or service individually [47]. The well-known and most visited destinations have an ofﬁcial website. Table 1 shows the ofﬁcial websites of some of the destinations. These ofﬁcial websites provide some information about services provided in the destinations such as café and restaurants, accommodation, transportation, events, nightlife, what to visit, etc.  Secondly, social media plays an important role in decision-making process [48]. A research conducted with travelers from the USA, Australia, the UK, and Canada implies that 36% of tourists use social media and blog sites, while 54% of them use travel review sites [48]. In 2017, 58.2% of American travelers used user- generated content, and 54.6% used social media in the travel planning process. Fifty-two percent of Facebook users said friends’ photos affected their travel plans [49]. Besides Facebook, TripAdvisor, YouTube, Twitter, and LinkedIn are also used by tourists [40]. Carter [49] asserts that 29% of travelers use Facebook, 14%   Smart Tourism Destination in Smart Cities Paradigm: A Model for Antalya  71  Table 1 Ofﬁcial websites of destinations  Destinations Websites Barcelona Madrid Stockholm Rome Sydney London Paris Berlin  http:  www.barcelonaturisme.com  http:  www.esmadrid.com  http:  www.visitstockholm.com  http:  www.turismoroma.it  https:  www.sydney.com  https:  www.visitlondon.com  https:  en.parisinfo.com  https:  www.visitberlin.de en  use TripAdvisor, and 6% use Twitter before the travel planning. Social media is used not only before vacation but also during and post vacation. Especially before and during the trip, they rely on mobile technologies to simplify the travel by searching for information about transportation, accommodation, attractions, and activities [50]. Seventy-two percent of people share post-vacation photos on social media, and 70% update their Facebook status while they are still on vacation. In the post-vacation process, 76% post their vacation photos on social media, 55% like Facebook pages speciﬁc to a vacation, and 46% post hotel reviews [49]. As a result, tourism providers concern social media signiﬁcantly through different channels. Mistilis and Gretzel [51] stress that 50% of Australian tourism providers use social media.  5. Mobile apps: Tourists get access to end-user Internet service systems through their mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets besides their computers or the available computers they may use. The accessibility of easy-to-carry devices like these allows for the easy purchase of goods and services via mobile devices instead of through more conventional means [6]. Due to the widespread use of the Internet, mobile devices have also become a phenomenon [52]. Furthermore, smartphones have brought many changes to the tourism industry [53]. Multiple studies showed that an increasing number of consumers are booking travel arrangements on their mobile phones – a number that has been increasing steadily for the past six quarters. The travel industry, speciﬁcally, boasts over 50% growth year-over-year in mobile [54]. In the USA, almost 40% of tourists access travel information, while 25% book their trips using smartphones [53]. Sorrels [55] claims that 37% of consumers make shopping for ﬂights and 43% make a booking via smartphones. In 2017, 58.9% of American travelers used a mobile phone to access travel info. The digital travel sales are expected to reach 140 billion dollars by 2018 [56]. Mobile apps provide several beneﬁts to tourist. First, some websites are not suitable for mobile using, and mobile apps can overcome this problem. The menus of smartphone applications contain panoramas, videos, interpretation manuscripts, background music, narration, games, AR-based path ﬁnding, and SNS connection services  e.g., Facebook, Twitter, KakaoTalk  [57]. Additionally, it can be personalized for each tourist. Secondly, tourists can access restaurants, transportations, local activities, etc. using it. Mobile apps allow the   72  G. Ba¸ser et al.  tourist to reach information [58] and to purchase products and services [53] without the need of a web browser. Therefore, tourists can plan their travels or make room reservations through mobile apps [6]. According to TripAdvisor, 60% of smartphone users have downloaded travel apps, and 45% plan to use the apps for travel planning. Furthermore, 55% of travel apps are purchased within 3 days of travel or while travelers are at the destination. It shows the importance of mobile apps in the tourism industry. Thus, some destinations have launched their mobile applications to customers [53]. Singapore, Korea, London, and Brisbane are among the destinations that offer mobile applications  [11, 13, 45, 58, 59] . Moreover, some hotel chains, luxury resorts, and 5-star hotels have also launched their mobile applications to customers [50, 53]. Tourists could make a room reservation and access the guest loyalty program using the mobile app [53].  6. Mobile payment: Smart tourism is not only about being on the Internet or using mobile apps but also using other digital resources such as mobile payment that is receiving growing interest globally as an alternative to using cash, check, or credit cards [60]. Peng et al. [61] describe the mobile payment the use of a mobile device to conduct a tourism payment transaction in which money or funds are transferred from a payer to a receiver via an intermediary or directly, without an intermediary in the tourist destination. The tourists make mobile payments using mobile wallet which comprises of mobile phone with consumer- speciﬁc information that allows guest to make payment [6] via various wireless technologies [60] such as near ﬁeld communication  NFC , radio-frequency identiﬁcation  RFID , and unstructured supplementary service data  USSD  [6]. Mistilis and Gretzel’s [51] study shows that 70% of tourism providers operating in Australia offered online mobile payment facilities.  7. Virtual augmented reality: It is a computer-generated three-dimensional environ- ment that allows users to view, interact, and manifest their presence in a non-real environment. Depending on the interactivity provided, it may be immersive  e.g., using a helmet  or non-immersive  e.g., using monitors . Given the great potential of this technology in many areas, especially in tourism, there has been a widespread proliferation of mobile applications  apps  with augmented reality. These are used in museums, monuments, galleries, open spaces, and other tourist attractions where objects can be enhanced and supplemented, in real time, with a variety of information  text, images, three-dimensional animation, audio, or video  [6]. Augmented reality  AR  can be described as a combination of technologies that enable real-time mixing of computer-generated content with live video display. In other words, AR allows the physical world to be enriched digitally. AR augments user’s view and transforms it with the technologic devices such as a computer, mobile phones, etc. [62]. Thus, the user can view the real world augmented with additional 3D graphics layered to his her ﬁeld of vision [63]. So, AR increases the user’s reality perception and surrounding environment perception [62]. Lancaster, Vienna, Basel, Belgium, and London are some of the examples to mobile tourist guide applications [62, 64, 65].  8. Artiﬁcial intelligence  AI  and cognition in smart cities: Various artiﬁcial intel- ligence  AI  techniques have been applied to WSNs in smart cities to improve   Smart Tourism Destination in Smart Cities Paradigm: A Model for Antalya  73  their performance and achieve speciﬁc goals. We look at AI techniques as a means of introducing learning in the WSN. Learning is an important element in the observe, analyze, decide, and act  OADA  cognition loop [12, 66], used to implement the idea of cognitive wireless networks [67]. In fact, we can classify AI techniques into computational intelligence  CI  techniques, reinforcement learning  RL  techniques, cognitive sensor networks, multi-agent systems  MAS , and context-aware computing. Although these techniques are closely related with each other, we segregate them to show the different goals that learning can achieve for the network as follows.  3.1 Computational Intelligence  CI techniques are a set of nature-inspired computation methodologies that help in solving complex problems that are usually difﬁcult to fully formulate using simple mathematical models. Examples of CI techniques include genetic algorithms, neural networks, fuzzy logic, simulated annealing, artiﬁcial immune systems, swarm intel- ligence, and evolutionary computation. In a learning environment, CI techniques are useful when the learning agent cannot accurately sense the state of its environment. However, a major drawback of this methodology is that it can be computationally intense and may require some form of model-based off-line learning to deliver to the requirements of the application scenario. Techniques such as ant colony optimization, for example, can cause an undesirable increase in communication overhead in the smart city WSNs too [23–25].  3.2 Machine Learning  Machine learning can be classiﬁed into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning would be more compute intensive and requires a training sequence. Additionally, accuracy of the learning algorithm would then be deﬁned by this training sequence. In the unsupervised learning approach, the learning is from the environment being observed, and no training sequence is required. Reinforcement learning  RL  is a reward-based technique that emphasizes on learning while interacting with the environment, without relying on explicit supervision or complete model of the environment. It is a method of automating goal-directed learning and decision-making. In smart cities’ WSNs, RL has been successfully applied in networking tasks such as adaptive routing, identifying low cost and energy-balanced data delivery paths [68], and in information processing tasks involving data aggregation and inference [69].   74  G. Ba¸ser et al.  3.3 Cognitive Networks and Multi-agent Systems  Cognitive networks are built around the idea of having sensor networks evolve around user requirements. It is about taking a step toward developing intelligent networks that do not limit themselves to point-to-point communication within the network. Instead, they enable the network to perceive user requirements and deliver data using distributed intelligence in the network. To implement distributed intelligence in smart cities, the multi-agent systems  MAS  are typically used. The agents in these MAS are called cognitive agents. They may interact to achieve information fusion and retrieval and may also be able to predict data for future use.  3.4 Context-Aware Computing  In large-scale WSNs such as those in smart cities’ applications, a huge amount of data is generated. In order to derive useful information from raw data, context of the data plays an important part. Context awareness is even more important in the IoT era, as it enables the network to deliver relevant, user-requested data. While doing so, network resources are also conserved by extracting only meaningful information that is relevant to the requests, from the network. There are various aspects to context-aware computing. They are context acquiring, context modeling, context reasoning, and context distribution [70]. Context awareness is very important and valuable in IoT-based smart cities’ applications, as it can add value to the large amount of data available from these applications [23–25].  4 The STD Framework  The case study approach is regarded to be appropriate in this study since it includes the analysis of reports, studies, news, articles, and other text-sensitive documentation and provides a comprehensive coverage of information. According to Simon et al. [71], the case study is a focusing approach that allows the discovery of a variety of interactive processes and the factors involved in an in-depth study of a destination. It is a ﬂexible process, taking into account unexpected issues that may arise or which a participant deems important.  The case study as a research method can include various techniques. Among primary research, the most frequently used methods are observation and interviews [71]. The case study method is, therefore, appropriate to achieve the objectives of the study since it includes the analysis of reports, studies, news, articles, and other text- sensitive documentation and provides a comprehensive coverage of information. In-depth interviews are also made with ofﬁcers who are in charge of promotion   Smart Tourism Destination in Smart Cities Paradigm: A Model for Antalya  75  of Antalya  Ministry of Culture and Tourism  and smart city project  Antalya Municipality .  The study consists of three stages:  1. A comprehensive literature review of smart technology which could be applied  for tourism  2. Determining the current applications in Antalya tourism destination 3. Proposing a model for Antalya to be a smart tourism destination  4.1 Antalya as an STD  Antalya, an important destination of the Turkish tourism industry, is located in the Southern Mediterranean of Turkey. Antalya has been very popular as tourism destination because of its clean beaches, sea, Mediterranean climate, and high number of historical and natural sights. In addition, one of the main characteristics of the region is having new, high quality, and a high number of accommodation facilities compared to competitor countries and regions. As of 2018, Antalya as a tourism destination has 590.000-bed capacity [72].  Smart tourism destination is a new concept for Antalya, and it is mainly attached to “smart city” applications. In the ﬁrst months of 2015, the Metropolitan Municipality of Antalya announced that it started a project to become a smart city in tourism, transportation, health, security, and municipal services. In addition, it was announced that free Internet, electronic trafﬁc control system, smart public transportation system, intelligent tourism points, intelligent health service, unob- structed SMS system, intelligent environment, and smart energy systems would be established within the scope of the project  [73], p. 158 . The current state of Antalya in the context of smart tourism can be summarized as follows in Table 2.  4.2 An STD Model for Antalya  The smart tourism process can be examined in three phases, namely, before the vacation, during the vacation, and post-vacation. In before-the-vacation phase, tourists try to get information about the destination and try to plan their vacation. Mostly they start by visiting the website of the planned destination and the travel blog sites. In this respect, smartphone applications can also be considered as an efﬁcient tool because it enables tourists to ﬁnd information anywhere and anytime in accordance with where the users are and what situation is through the latest technology, including applications, augmented reality  AG , and location-based service  LBS  [58]. The social media can also affect the tourists’ decision where a destination to be visited has not yet been decided at this stage. The attractive or interesting photos about a destination shared by the service providers or tourists’   76  Antalya  Table 2 A summary of Antalya city STD  Website www.antalyadestination.com www.visitantalya.com www.visit-antalya.com www.antalyatourguide.org www.antalyakulturturizm.gov.tr www.antalya.gov.tr www.antalya.bel.tr www.antalyamiz.com www.antalyatourguide.com www.visitkemer.com  Kemer Manavgat www.visitmanavgatside.com Side www.visitmanavgatside.com  Belek Serik Demre  www.visitbelek.com  hometurkey.com  G.

When the destination to be visited is decided, tourists search available hotels operating in the destination using travel blogs or social media, and ﬁnally, they make hotel booking via the hotel or travel agency websites. Tourists can also make hotel booking via hotels’ social media accounts. Due to the technologic development, nowadays some hotel and travel companies provide booking service via their mobile apps. Thus, tourists can prefer hotel and travel booking using their mobile apps.  In during-the-vacation phase, tourists are expected to have a high level of satisfaction from their vacations; this could be supported by supplying them easy access to information as well as high-quality and fast information. This section covers the transportation, sightseeing, accommodation, dining, shopping, and all other facilities demanded by a tourist. As an example, some hotels allow tourists keyless room entering via mobile apps. Free applications provide information about the museums, restaurants, café-bar, etc. located at the destination. Thus, tourists can make a tour plan or make a sightseeing using the mobile apps. During the sightseeing, they can take photos and can share them on their social media accounts by mentioning the destination or the hotel.  In the post-vacation phase, tourists can share photos related to their vacations. They can also share thoughts about the destination or hotel on travel blogs. Post- vacation stage is crucial since the tourists may decide to revisit and share their impressions for the destination. Table 3 shows the model for Antalya as a smart tourism destination.

The linkage between one tourism product and another at destination level is vital because of the nature of tourism industry which are combinations of multiple components served in several touch points that are perceived by the customer prior, during, and after their trip [74]. Therefore, the model needs to be organized, coordinated, and controlled by a “smart tourism ofﬁce” to be established by a group of experts from tourism sector, university, engineers, municipality, and government.  The model focuses on attempts to be made before, during, and after vacation for a tourist. The main goal is to provide a higher-quality tourist experience by providing a fast, easy, and high-quality access to services, tourist attractions, gastronomy, accommodation, transportation, etc. For this purpose, in the “before vacation” stage, tourists need proper information through websites, apps, IoT, social media, design your vacation site, and bloggers. For the time being, Antalya has many websites which may cause a confusion for potential tourists. During vacation stage, tourists need to plan their stay as well as having a good organization, joy, and satisfaction which can be achieved by digital accommodations, apps, smart transportation, kiosks, QR codes, virtual reality, IoT, and artiﬁcial intelligence. After vacation stage requires follow-up messages, IoT, and social media.  The main beneﬁt of the model would be to provide tourists to get fast, reliable, easy information which would increase the quality of their tourism experience. Today, tourism industry is subject to the technological transformation that can make the conducting of business easier and faster and the transmission of information more convenient [6]. The model would enable tourists access to services, touristic attractions, shops, transportation, local food, hospitals, etc. easily and safely.  Secondly, smart tourism applications like augmented reality and apps may increase the positive impression of the tourists for the tourism destination as they may get interesting information which may create excitement and pleasure. Next, they may help other travelers in their decision-making process, revive and reinforce their travel experiences, as well as construct their self-image and status on social networks  [11, 13], p. 181 . This would increase the destination’s image and would attract more tourists to the destination.  Tourism revenue, has a contribution of 3.1% to Turkish GDP in 2017, which inﬂuences its impact and importance for the economy. There seems to be many applications and practices of ICT to be adapted for tourism. Tourism industry can be one of the driving forces of modern economies as it is a leader user of ICT [6]. Tourism industry is expected to grow vastly in Turkey and inﬂuence the ICT sector positively.  Finally, there needs to be a council, board, or an ofﬁce to coordinate the smart tourism destination network which would follow all kinds of steps, applications, practices, etc. Becoming a smart tourism destination requires leadership, vision, patience, strategic management, and continuous evaluation and change. Perceiving the smart tourism destination as an ecosystem is essential, and a vision and   Smart Tourism Destination in Smart Cities Paradigm: A Model for Antalya  79  a clear set of goals for innovation are key facilitators for developing smart tourism destinations as a collective whole  [5], p. 119 . In addition, smart tourism applications require a continuous follow-up for 24 h. For this purpose, the smart tourism destination council can be formed by a group of engineers, tourism experts, municipality ofﬁcers, etc. Public-private partnership  PPP  is essential when running a smart tourism destination initiative. Enhancing collective intelligence is essential in smart tourism destinations  [5], p. 118 .  Another fact to consider is the “smart city” and smart tourism destination link. Smart city infrastructure and applications interact with smart tourism destinations. Therefore, smart tourism destination would promote and improve fastly in case of smart city practices. Smart tourism destinations should also perform smartness by implementing appropriate tourism applications within smart cities’ components as deﬁned by [14]. To take full advantage of the current possibilities provided by smartness, destination managers have to integrate the entire range of smartness components and ensure interoperability and interconnectivity of both soft and hard smartness  [5], p. 120 . Also, smart tourism destinations need to emphasize ways to enhance the tourist experience, while simultaneously improving the quality of life for residents.  Local and foreign tourists need information about how to use and access to smart tourism destination network and content. It is recommended that destinations not only focus on exploiting the use of new technology but also educate the citizens and visitors on how to best use this new technology.  Finally, to survive, traditional tourism ﬁrms have to redeﬁne their business model and the way they propose to create customer value  [11, 13], p. 183 . Smart tourism destination can be an important tool for creating customer value by taking the advantage of technology.  References  1. Buhalis, D., & Amaranggana, A.  2014 .

A Hybrid Approach for Image Segmentation in the IoT Era  Tallha Akram, Syed Rameez Naqvi, Sajjad Ali Haider, and Nadia Nawaz Qadri  1 Introduction  The Internet of Things  IoT  has a potential to transform our world by intelligently connecting every device that touches both of our professional and everyday lives through a range of sensors, cloud computing, etc. and also has a capacity to unlock the door to the next industrial revolution. In the last decade, IoT has covered numerous domains including communication [1, 2], energy efﬁciency [3, 4], vehicular systems [5], smart farming [6], healthcare [7], computer vision [8], and to name a few. Detecting object of interest from an IoT-based camera device can be useful, especially under the scenario of identifying one dedicated class from a bulk of processed information.  Spectral clustering is a class of graph theoretic procedure, which is popular for ﬁnding natural groupings. Over the last decade, it has become a widely adopted tool for image segmentation problems via the normalized cut  NCut  criterion [9]. Spectral clustering popularity increased substantially among the researchers in the ﬁeld of computer vision, bioinformatics, robotics, etc. The idea has proven itself to be an active area of research among machine learning community. The core reasons behind are its capability to accurately group complex structured data and its simplicity in implementation. Image segmentation using spectral clustering is not an expedient way of dealing large size images due to its high computational demand and memory requirements. To overcome such predicament, a dimensional reduction procedure is integrated as an effective preprocessor before calculating an afﬁnity matrix – which combats the curse of dimensionality. In the situation where computational bottleneck is comprehended, a competent selection of suitable  T. Akram   cid:2   · S. R. Naqvi · S. A. Haider · N. N.

Fig. 1 A pictorial illustration of weighted binary tree-based fast spectral clustering  preprocessor reduces the bottleneck risk by reducing the data structure size. Selection of preprocessor is a key task and has foremost effects on clustering.  In this work, we propose an unsupervised image segmentation technique using spectral clustering aimed at salient object extraction. Few challenges faced by image segmentation based on spectral clustering are its infeasibility to process large images due to high computational demand, memory requirements, and its sensitivity to irrelevant and noisy data. These challenges are successfully addressed in the proposed work of weighted binary tree-based fast spectral clustering  WBTFSC ; sample results are demonstrated in Fig. 1. The algorithm integrates dimensionality reduction method into spectral clustering by introducing an effective preprocessor, which is comprised of two fundamental steps:  1  color quantization based on weighted binary tree and  2  unique pixels selection. Noisy images are also tested with proposed algorithm and showed exceptional results comparable to the other implemented techniques.  Many clustering techniques are strictly bound to Euclidean geometry, making assumption explicitly or implicitly to form convex regions in Euclidean space, compared to be more ﬂexible and conﬁned to wider geometry range of spectral clustering [10].  Color quantization is deemed to be a prerequisite of many color image seg- mentation algorithms, and we exploited this key to be an effective preprocessor [11–13]. The contribution is twofold: Firstly, we leveraged the fact that natural images include fewer consistent groups than pixels [14] and introduced an effective preprocessor of weighted binary partition tree for quantization. Secondly, selection of unique pixels from normalized image further reduces the data structure size before subjecting to spectral clustering. Labeling is ﬁnalized using fuzzy C-means soft clustering to exhibit fuzzy behavior and making it feasible for salient object extraction with fused clusters.   A Hybrid Approach for Image Segmentation in the IoT Era  87  In spectral clustering, image is represented by a weighted graph, where each pixel is a node connected to other nodes with edges. Despite the fact, spectral clustering achieves accurate clustering and makes precise segments, it is still not considered to be a strong competitor to other clustering techniques [15, 16]. Spectral algorithm forms afﬁnity matrix of size  n × n , where n is the total number of pixels in the image, and computes eigenvectors of this afﬁnity matrix with computational complexity of O n3  and memory requirement of O n2 .  To improve the performance of spectral clustering, multiple schemes were proposed and implemented [17, 18]. One technique is the providence of original data representatives, which should have the capacity of retaining original values. Exploiting the subsampling of randomly selected data w.r.t. to grouping criteria is another reasonable approach. Low-rank approximation in spectral clustering is another central option for the dimensionality reduction. High-quality clustering achieved by spectral clustering can be annihilated with poor choice of preprocessor, which must be selected carefully for improved performance.  2 Related Work  Spectral clustering for image segmentation is a graph theory-based information extraction procedure which describes the image as a weighted graph and partitions them using optimized cost function. Segmentation is done under the potency of feature vectors  directly indirectly , based on eigendecomposition of graph Laplacian matrix [19]. Possibly the ﬁrst comprehensive effort was made by Shi and Malik [20] to segment image using spectral clustering. They formulated the problem from a graph theoretic perspective and introduced a normalized cut to segment the image.  Traditionally spectral clustering performance degraded hastily when dealing with high-resolution images due to its high computational cost. To overcome this problem, few techniques are implemented depending on the nature of the problems. Bruce et al. [18] used the multilevel approach for graph partitioning in which sequence of increasingly smaller graphs approximate a complete graph. The smallest graph is then partitioned using spectral clustering and ﬁnally back propagated to graph hierarchy. Same spirit of multilevel approach is discussed by Yan et al. [21] where coarsening and un-coarsening methodology are followed and algorithm is designed to deal with the computational requirements to overcome spatial bottleneck. They employed fast approximate spectral clustering using K- means clustering and random projection trees as a preprocessing step. The intension was to minimize data reduction effect on clustering accuracy, in the spirit of rate- distortion theory.  Another approach was put forth by Ducoumau et al. [22], where clustering was conﬁgured as hypergraph cut problem to optimize the objective function. The proposed method was based on the principle of multilevel paradigm with three key steps, starting with the initial step of hypergraph reduction, followed by a spectral   88  T. Akram et al.  clustering of reduced hypergraph, and the ﬁnal step of cluster reﬁnement. Similarly, Tung et al. [23] implemented a new distinctive approach of block-wise processing in combination with stochastic ensemble consensus. They ﬁrst divided the image into multiple nonoverlapping ﬁx-sized blocks and then calculated afﬁnity matrix for each block. Finally, they merged the segments using stochastic ensemble consensus. Tasdemir et al. [26] proposed approximate spectral clustering in combination with neural networks by employing self-organizing maps and neural gas as quan- tizer – a preprocessing step. They exploited local density-based similarity measure without user-predeﬁned parameters. Similarly, a fast afﬁnity propagation clustering approach was implemented by Shang et al. [20] in which they considered both local and global structural information. The concept was based on multilevel graph partitioning which managed to implement both vector-based and graph-based clustering.  Fowlkes et al. [14] made an exertion to overcome the time and computational limitations by incorporating the low-rank approximation. They introduced Nystrom- based spectral clustering algorithm for image segmentation. The main idea was to solve the grouping problems for small random subsets of pixels in image and then anticipate this solution to all pixels. To improve Nystrom spectral clustering, few methods were also proposed in literature by applying different quantization schemes [27]. All techniques referred above are based on the concept of quantization before object of interest detection. A concept of ﬁnding salient regions is also presented which is based on attention mechanism and considers contrast to be a primary factor.  Goferman et al. [28] proposed context-aware saliency detection. The objective is to detect the salient region s  with respect to a scene. They considered both low level and global feature. Cheng et al. [29] proposed histogram-based contrast method to measure saliency. One of the biggest challenges in saliency detection is to acquire salient regions w.r.t. scene understanding.  3 Clustering Methods  The proposed design is a combination of multiple clustering methods including hier- archical clustering  weighted binary partitioned tree , graph clustering  spectral , and ﬁnally fuzzy clustering  C-means . Sample results of proposed technique are demonstrated in Fig. 2.  3.1 Weighted Binary Partition Tree Let us consider an image S of size  n × n  for  m = n  where s =  r, c  for  s ∈ S  to be row and column indices.

Each partitioned node belongs to its parent node which ﬂows up in the hierarchy to the root node “X” – the starting point of any partition. Let Pn represents set of image pixels which correspond to node n. For the proposed weighted binary tree, let the head node  n  be represented by a number “1,” while the children nodes are 2n and 2n + 1. The partition of X is on the basis of colors for the selected image. The partition is controlled by cluster colors which rely on mean and variance value and   90  T.

Rn =  cid:18  s∈Pn  Ws xs xt s  On =  cid:18  s∈Pn  Ws xs  μn = On   Pn   where minimum squared deviation is given by a cluster mean; therefore, it favors an assumption that mean is equal to q – the cluster’s quantization value.

This approach is modiﬁed to show improved performance for large clusters, which endorses the maximum cluster’s variation by handling and splitting order.

Akram et al.  3.2 Spectral Clustering  Spectral clustering for image segmentation is a graph theory-based information extraction procedure which describes the image as weighted graphs and partitions them using optimized cost function. LetG V, E  be an undirected graph, where V =  v1, v2, v3, . . . , vn  are a set of n nonempty vertices along with set of edges, E. The graph is weighted; each edge between vertices vi and vj have a weight of wij > 0.  cid:11  ∈ E.  cid:11  ∈ V & E  cid:11  Gt is subgraph of G having vertices and edges  V The weight adjacency is given as W =  wij n × n, where wij ∈  cid:12  n × n . For weight values  wij  = 0, correspond to the fact that vertices Vi and Vj are not connected. Different techniques like K−neighbors, k−nearest neighbors, and fully con- nected graph are used to transform given data points  x1, . . . , xn  into pairwise distance dij or pairwise similarities sij into graph. Let dij be the dissimilarity matrix; the weight matrix W =  wij  for  i, j  = 1, . . . ,n can be calculated from sigmoid function as:    with the fact V   cid:11  , E  wij = exp− cid:29  cid:29   xi − xj   cid:29  cid:29 2   2σ 2 For i  cid:13 = j & 0 Otherwise.   11   The parameter σ has supplementary impact on clustering obtained. The selection of σ is a very critical step; one approach is to run an algorithm for different values of σ until the least squared intra-cluster distance to its center position is obtained [23]. Mentioned hit and trial rule for optimal value of σ looks not feasible for large datasets, so few other strategies are instigated [31]. We selected sigma value 1 for the optimized solution. The degree matrix D is deﬁned as diagonal matrix with D = [dij]n × n, where dij ∈  cid:12 n × n deﬁned as di = n cid:28  wij . un-normalized graph Laplacian is given as j=1 L = D − W, which may vary in case of unweighted graph as L = D − A, where A is adjacency binary matrix of G given as A = aij n × n , where aij = 1 if edge connection is found between Vi and Vj and 0 if otherwise. The Laplacian matrix must satisfy the following properties. For vector X ∈  cid:12 n × n  cid:7 2  :   12   xT Lx = 1 2  n cid:18  i,j=1   cid:6  xi − xj  wij  L is symmetric positive deﬁnite. The smallest eigenvalue of L is 0, with corresponding eigen indicator vector 1, i.e., 1 =  1, 1, . . . , 1 T. Luxburg [32] theoretically proves all the properties of graph Laplacian matrix. Fiedler suggested that λ2 is the second eigenvector of L that represents relationship among connected graph components also known as ﬁelder’s eigenvector. The normalized Laplacian matrix is given as L = I − D − 0.5 . Second random-walk Laplacian matrix is given as Lrw = I − D −1W.  − 0.5 WD   A Hybrid Approach for Image Segmentation in the IoT Era  93  4 Proposed Methodology  The proposed object extraction algorithm is summarized with ﬂowchart shown in Fig. 4, which incorporates three fundamental stages; the ﬁrst stage deals with color quantization using weighted binary tree, where the ﬁrst loop divides the image into distinct clusters, while the second loop  assigns each cluster a unique color value from the palette. The second stage deals with the normalization procedure and ﬁnding unique pixels in the quantized image and followed by ﬁnal stage of object of interest detection and later extraction using spectral clustering.  Algorithm analysis revealed us that reduction of a color palette size with weighted binary partition tree quantization still is not very effective in calculating reduced similarity matrix of size  n × n , considerably when image is of large size. The reduction of distinct colors as an outcome of binary tree quantization has no effect on total number of nodes subjected to spectral clustering but to the number of natural colors. To overcome such predicament, all pixels are normalized in the range of  0 → 1  before selecting unique values to construct similarity graph. Essentially, duplication removal process keeps in record total number of duplicate pixels and their respective addresses for each basic RGB value. This procedure allows us to deal with large size images in calculating afﬁnity matrix, which is one of the prime steps in spectral clustering.  The number of clusters K is deﬁned by user under constraint that the weighted binary tree quantization clusters are greater than spectral clustering, so not to annihilate the visual contents of image but to reduce the number of distinct colors. If number of clusters created using spectral clustering is insufﬁcient in number, it will result in fused segments of object and background, resulting in false segmentation. For similarity matrix, sigmoid function approach is used instead of K-nearest neighbors and  cid:7 -neighborhood graph, due to large number of connected compo- nents. Ultimately, grouping is done using fuzzy C-means algorithm, and cluster members are mapped to their respective addresses with the duplication sequence. The method shows performance degradation if preprocessor is not deﬁned well or image having uniformly distributed pixels.  Based on the evaluation of WBTFSC in obtaining meaningful segmentation for  object of interest detection, spectral clustering fulﬁlls two conditions:    Nodes that represent possibly larger connected regions belong to object of  interest class and should be selected.    Regions represented by selected clusters should be disjoint.   94  Fig. 4 General ﬂow diagram of weighted binary tree-based fast spectral clustering  T. Akram et al.   A Hybrid Approach for Image Segmentation in the IoT Era  95  5 Results and Discussion  To assess the performance of proposed algorithm from the perspective of object of interest detection and extraction, a set of images are selected from MSRA1 salient object database, Berkeley2 segmentation dataset, and image collection of our group, with the perspective of ﬁnding at least one obvious salient object. To show the consistency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, performance measure was credited in respect of accuracy and efﬁciency. Results are visually compared with three state-of-the-art algorithms. Analysis is made from the perspective of object of interest extraction. In order to show the consistency and effectiveness of the proposed WBTFSC algorithm, different performance measures are credited, in respect to time, size, and efﬁciency. To demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithm, we compared our results with three state-of-the-art algorithms, spectral clustering [30], curve evolution with low depth of ﬁeld [24], and graph-based visual saliency  GBVS  [25].  Few images are selected for visual comparison between proposed technique and selected methods as shown in Figs. 2, 5, and 6. Ideal segmentation or ground truth is shown in column 6 which are manually segmented images to calculate accuracy. Our approach has shown notable results, visually observed in column 5, when compared with conventional spectral clustering [31] in column 2, curve evolution approach in column 3, and graph-based visual saliency in column 4. It is observed that not only the test images with single salient object showed good performance but test images with multiple salient objects are also segmented and extracted successfully and can be observed in images “b,” “e,” “I,” “n,” etc.  With weighted binary tree palette design, few image pixels are misclassiﬁed and covered with wrong cluster labels which results in the loss of object information with spectral clustering object extraction procedure. In order to coup with this situation, we took advantage of soft clustering of fuzzy C-means algorithm. It assigns data member xi not to strictly bind to one cluster, rather deal it in ﬂexible way. For the proposed technique, object extraction principle is based on color distinctness where each color represents different cluster. The presence of multiple clusters within salient object results in the loss of inner details of object and can be observed in images “f,” “k,” and “p,” but objects’ contours remain preserved.  Table 1 shows time comparison of all selected techniques and size comparison of proposed method and spectral clustering, which can be analyzed with respect to similarity graph time and total processing time to extract an object. It can be noticed that WBTFSC has shown a remarkable reduction in similarity graph time to create  n × n  matrix. The maximum time for spectral method is 45.27 s for image “e” as compared to 9.28 s for WBTFSC.

GBVS has shown minimum time for object detection, but results are in contrary to our approach in terms of accuracy. A comparison of proposed method and spectral clustering in terms of executaion time and similarity graph size is given in Fig. 7. Notable difference can be observed in execution time and similarity graph size where WBTFSC maximum nodes are approximately 16 K in size and execution time less than 20 s in contrast to spectral clustering.

This deﬁciency is challenged with our proposed method and showed exceptional results, demonstrated in Fig. 8. We introduced three different types of noises with different intensity levels and extracted the object of interest with good accuracy. It can be observed that our proposed technique showed better results especially when salt-and-pepper noise is introduced. Table 2 shows similarity graph time and total time for noisy images. For each column assigned to different noises, left sub-column shows our proposed method processing time, and right sub-column shows spectral clustering’s processing time.  In order to objectively evaluate the segmentation performance from the per- spective of object of interest detection and extraction, we consider two different strategies. For the ﬁrst, output image is segmented into regions  R1,R2, . . . ,Rn . i=1Ri = I . For each segment Ri in image, if more Ri ∩ Rj = φ for i  cid:13 = j and ∪n than 50% overlap with ground truth foreground OGT, it counts as foreground R [34– 35].  We tested the efﬁciency of images by dividing into 164 regions segments;  comparative plot is shown in Fig. 9  right .  or  Robj = ∪   i: pRi ,OMS >0.5 Ri .   cid:4  Ri , OMS ≥ p  Rk, OMS   ,∀k ε [1, ns]  p   13    14    98  T.

The next stage identiﬁes unique color pixels in the image which further reduce number of pixels, as spectral clustering constructs afﬁnity matrix of size  n × n , where n is the total number of pixels in image.  Selection of unique pixels reduces number of nodes for graph method to overcome memory limitations and computational time. The results are subjected to fuzzy C-means for ﬁnal grouping, followed by a concluding step of mapping back pixels to their original addresses. The algorithm showed satisfactory results compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms. Noisy images are also tested, Gaus- sian, salt-and-pepper, and speckle, and achieved amazing results compared to other object extraction approaches. In addition to design’s effectiveness, there are few shortcomings which need to be addressed in future articles including number of pre- deﬁned clusters for both weighted binary tree and spectral clustering. Additionally, few conditions should be considered in order to identify the objects of interest as it shows different color and contrast compared to the background, different textural details, etc.  References  1.

Big Data Analytics for Intelligent Internet of Things  Mohiuddin Ahmed, Salimur Choudhury, and Fadi Al-Turjman  1 Introduction  A successful of Internet of Things  IoT  environment requires standardization that contains interoperability, compatibility, reliability, and effectiveness of the operations on a global scale [1]. The rapid growth of cloud computing facility and the IoT causes a sharp growth of data. Enormous amounts of networking sensors are continuously collecting and transmitting data to be stored and processed in the cloud. Such data can be environmental data, geographical data, astronomical data, logistic data, etc. Mobile devices, transportation facilities, public facilities, and home appliances are the primary data acquisition equipment in IoT. The volume of such data will surpass the capacities of the IT architectures and infrastructure of existing enterprises and, due to real-time analysis character, will also greatly impact the computing capacity [2]. Management of these increasingly growing data is a challenge for the community in general. Figure 1 shows a year over year rise on the amount of data.  Due to the characteristics of the data being generated from IoT environment, we can call these data as Big data. The challenges faced by the IoT users compelled to label these data as Big data! Therefore the Big data generated by IoT has  M. Ahmed College of Technology and Design, Canberra Institute of Technology, Canberra, ACT, Australia e-mail: m.ahmed.au@ieee.org  S.

Fig. 1 Year over year rise of data volume. 1 Zetta Byte = 1 Trillion Gigabytes [3]  unique characteristics due to different types of data collected. The most common characteristics of these data reﬂect heterogeneity, variety, unstructured feature, noise, and high redundancy [2, 4]. It is envisaged that by 2030, the quantity of sensors will reach one trillion, and then the IoT data will be the most important part of Big data, according to the forecast of HP [5]. In fact, various artiﬁcial intelligence  AI  techniques have been applied to wireless sensors to improve their performance and achieve speciﬁc goals. We can look at AI techniques as a means of introducing an intelligent learning in a key enabling technology in IoT, which is the wireless sensor network  WSN . Learning is an important element in the observe, analyse, decide, and act  OADA  cognition loop [6, 7], used to implement the idea of cognitive wireless networks [8, 9]. We can broadly classify AI techniques as computational intelligence  CI  techniques, reinforcement learning  RL  techniques, cognitive sensor networks and multi-agent systems  MAS , and context-aware computing. Although these techniques are closely related with each other, we can segregate them to show the different goals that learning can achieve for the network.  CI techniques are a set of nature-inspired computation methodologies that help in solving complex problems that are usually difﬁcult to fully formulate using simple mathematical models. Examples of CI techniques include genetic algorithms, neural networks, fuzzy logic, simulated annealing, artiﬁcial immune systems, swarm intelligence, and evolutionary computation. In a learning environment, CI techniques are useful when the learning agent cannot accurately sense the state of its environment. In WSNs, CI techniques have been applied to problems such as node deployment planning, task scheduling, data aggregation, energy-aware routing, and QoS management. Authors in [10] have provided an extensive survey of CI techniques applied to WSNs. They elaborate on various CI techniques and associate each with typical problem domains they can solve in WSNs. From their observations, swarm intelligence applied to solving the routing and clustering problem has drawn the most research attention in recent times. However, a major   Big Data Analytics for Intelligent Internet of Things  109  drawback of this methodology is that it can be computationally intense and may require some form of model-based ofﬂine learning to deliver to the requirements of the application scenario. Techniques such as ant colony optimization can cause an undesirable increase in communication overhead in WSNs [11] too. Apart from these drawbacks, none of the CI algorithms have been applied to solving problems of data representation, aggregation, and delivery in a distributed, decentralized setup, under dynamic communication constraints, as is the case in data hungry IoT applications.  According to Intel [1, 12], data produced from IoT has three distinguishing  features:  – Terminals generating massive amount of data; – Semi-structured or nonstructured; – Data of IoT is not useful without analysis.  Due to the generation of Big data by IoT, the existing data processing capacity of IoT is becoming ineffective, and it is imperative to incorporate Big data technologies to promote the development of IoT. It is important to understand that the success of IoT lies upon the effective incorporation of Big data analytics. The widespread deployment of IoT also gives a challenge to Big data community to propose newer techniques as Big data and IoT are interdependent. On one hand, the widespread deployment of IoT produces data both in quantity and category, thus providing the opportunity for the application and development of Big data; on the other hand, the incorporation of Big data analytics to IoT simultaneously accelerates the research advances and business models of IoT.  Figure 2 shows a holistic view of the relationship between IoT and Big data. Earlier the amount of data generated by IoT systems could be easily handled by the traditional data analytics techniques. However, as amount of data being generated by the IoT systems are transformed into Big data, the traditional analytics methods  Fig. 2 Association relation between IoT and Big data   110  M. Ahmed et al.  are not effective. It is important to understand the fact that, the traditional data analytics methods are not suitable to extract knowledge from Big data. For gaining meaningful insights or knowledge from the Big data generated by IoT, a set of robust data analytics method is required. Therefore, it is imperative to incorporate the analytics techniques suitable for Big data generated by the IoT systems.  In this chapter, the key aspects of Big data analytics are presented in detail. Section 2 starts with the deﬁnition of Big data; Sect. 3 reﬂects the challenges associated with Big data. Section 4 provides the taxonomy of Big data analytics followed by subsections on data acquisition & storage, programming model, benchmarking, analysis, and applications. Section 5 contains the future research directions of IoT data analytics followed by conclusion of the chapter.  2 Deﬁnition of Big Data  Big data is an abstract concept [13]. The concept of Big data is rudimentarily dependent on the conﬁguration of a system, i.e. RAM, HDD capacity, etc. [14]. The signiﬁcance of Big data has been recognized very recently and has different opinions on its deﬁnition. In layman’s term, Big data reﬂects the datasets that could not be perceived, acquired, managed, and processed by traditional IT and software hardware tools in efﬁcient manner [15]. Communities like scientiﬁc and technological enterprises, research scholars, data analysts, and technical practition- ers have different deﬁnitions of Big data [16]. The following set of deﬁnitions provides an understanding on the profound social, economic, and technological connotations of Big data:  – Apache Hadoop [17]: “Datasets which could not be captured, managed, and  processed by general computers within an acceptable scope”.  – McKinsey & Company [18]: “Big data shall mean such datasets which could not  be acquired, stored, and managed by classic database software”.  – Doug Laney [19]: “Challenges and opportunities brought about by increased data  with a 3Vs model, i.e., the increase of Volume, Velocity, and Variety”.  – IBM, Microsoft [20, 21]: “In the 3V model, Volume means, with the generation and collection of masses of data, data scale becomes increasingly Big; Velocity means the timeliness of Big data; Variety indicates the various types of data, which include semi-structured and unstructured data such as audio, video, webpage, and text, as well as traditional structured data”.  – NIST [22]: “Big data means the data of which the data volume, acquisition speed, or data representation limits the capacity of using traditional relational methods to conduct effective analysis or the data which may be effectively processed with important horizontal zoom technologies, which focuses on the technological aspect of Big data”.  – Manyika et al. [23]: “Datasets whose size is beyond the ability of typical database  software tools to capture, store, manage, and analyze”.   Big Data Analytics for Intelligent Internet of Things  111  – Davis and Patterson [24]: “Big data is data too Big to be handled and analyzed  by traditional database protocols such as SQL”.  – Edd Dumbill [25]: “Explicitly conveys the multi-dimensionality of Big Data when adding that the data is too Big, moves too fast, or doesn’t ﬁt the strictures of your database architectures”.  To describe Big data, a number of V have been used in the literature. Here we  combine all the Vs as below:  – Volume: The term “volume” is related with the amount of data and its dimension- ality. The advantage from the ability to process large amounts of information is the main attraction of Big data analytics. The consequence is that it is a trend for many companies to store vast amount of various sorts of data: social networks data, healthcare data, ﬁnancial data, biochemistry and genetic data, astronomical data, etc.  – Variety: “Variety” refers to the mix of different types of data. These data do not have a ﬁxed structure and rarely present themselves in a perfectly ordered form and ready for processing [26]. Indeed, such data can be highly structured, semi- structured, or unstructured  video, still images, audio, clicks, etc. .  – Variability: It can be added to “variety” to emphasize on semantics, or the  variability of meaning in language and communication protocols.  – Velocity: “Velocity” involves streams of data, structured records creation, and availability for access and delivery. Most of the Internet-based applications are streaming in nature and a source of Big data. The importance is reﬂected in the speed of the feedback loop, taking data from input through to decision.  – Value: This feature is the purpose of Big data technology. This view is well expressed by the International Data Corporation [4] when saying that Big data architectures are “designed to economically extract value from very large volumes of a wide variety of data, by enabling high-velocity capture, discovery, and or analysis”. This value falls into two categories: analytical use and enabling new business models, products, and services [17–25].  – Veracity: Veracity deﬁnes the truth or fact, or in short, accuracy, certainty, and precision. Uncertainty can be caused by inconsistencies, model approximations, ambiguities, deception, fraud, duplication, incompleteness, spam, and latency. Due to veracity, results derived from Big data cannot be proven, but they can be assigned a probability [4].  3 Challenges with Big Data  The Big data era brings a set of challenges on data acquisition, storage, management, analysis, and so on. Traditional data management and analysis systems are based on the relational database management system  RDBMS  [4]. However, such systems are usable with structured data only and cannot deal with the semi-structured or unstructured data which are a signiﬁcant portion of Big data. In fact, Big data are   112  M. Ahmed et al.  not necessarily structured data and require preprocessing before analysis. It is visible that the traditional RDBMSs cannot handle the huge volume and heterogeneity of Big data. The research community has proposed some solutions from different perspectives. A promising solution is cloud computing which is utilized to meet the requirements on infrastructure for Big data, i.e. cost-efﬁciency and smooth upgrading downgrading, etc. In a nutshell, it is a non-trivial task to deploy Big data analysis infrastructure. The key challenges are listed as follows.  3.1 Data Representation  The collected data from different sources are composed of certain levels of hetero- geneity in the type, structure, semantics, organization, granularity, and accessibility. Therefore, it is important to properly represent Big data for further analysis. The goal of proper data representation is to make data more meaningful for analysis and user interpretation. An improper data representation will signiﬁcantly impact the value of the original data and barrier to effective data analysis. An example of efﬁcient data representation contains data structure, class, and type, as well as integrated technologies to enable efﬁcient operations on different datasets [4, 26].  3.2 Redundancy  Usually the collected data comes with a high level of redundancy. For effective data analysis, it is important to use redundancy reduction and data compression approaches. For example, a large portion of data generated by sensor networks is highly redundant, which are required to be ﬁltered and compressed for a robust analysis. In Big data environment, newer technologies are required to be incorporated as the redundant Big data will have a signiﬁcant impact on the analysis [4, 26].  3.3 Privacy and Security  Most Big data service providers or owners outsource their datasets for effective maintenance and analysis due to their limited capacity. Therefore, usage of external bodies or tools increases the potential privacy and safety risks. For example, the transactional dataset contains details of the lowest granularity and sensitive information such as credit card numbers. Therefore, outsourced analysis of Big data is only recommended with proper preventive measures such as data anonymization of sensitive data, to ensure its security and privacy [4, 26].   Big Data Analytics for Intelligent Internet of Things  113  3.4 Energy Efﬁciency  The energy consumption of high-end computing facilities is alarming due to their impact on both economic and environmental perspectives. Needless to mention that in the Big data environment, the energy consumption will be much higher than before and is unexpected from both ﬁnancial and environmental perspectives. The technology industry is looking for green computing; however, the Big data is a main constraint for this venture. Therefore, it is urgent to devise new approaches to control power consumption and management mechanism without affecting the expandability and accessibility are ensured [4, 26].  3.5 Challenges with Big IoT Data  Smart cities are constructed in IoT paradigm. Therefore, Big data originates from a number of sectors such as industry, agriculture, trafﬁc, transportation, healthcare, public departments, and so on [1–4]. According to the data acquisition and transmission approach in IoT, its network architecture may be divided into three layers: the sensing layer, the network layer, and the application layer. The sensing layer is responsible for data acquisition and mainly consists of sensor networks. The network layer is responsible for information transmission and processing, where close transmission may rely on sensor networks, and remote transmission shall depend on the Internet. Finally, the application layer support speciﬁc applications of IoT. The challenges associated with the Big IoT data are summarized as below:  – Large-scale data: Plenty of data acquisition sensors are distributed which acquire  heterogeneous data.  – Strong time and space correlation: The time and space correlation is an important property of IoT data. During data analysis and processing, time and space are also important dimensions for statistical analysis.  – Effective data: Unexpected and huge amount of noises usually occur during the acquisition and transmission of data in IoT. Among datasets acquired by acquisition devices, only a small amount of abnormal data is valuable.  4 Taxonomy of Big Data Analytics  Figure 3 shows the taxonomy of Big data analytics. It consists of ﬁve basic aspects of Big data. The ﬁrst category, Big data acquisition and storage, covers data acquisition and storage management. The Big data programming model includes research on programming models used in the Big data environment. The benchmark process covers the evaluation of Big data systems. The Big data analysis involves studies which focus on approaches to extract knowledge from Big data. The ﬁnal category,   114  M. Ahmed et al.  Fig. 3 Big data analytics taxonomy  application, covers studies related to the applications of Big data analytics in social, scientiﬁc, and business domains along with IoT which is the main focus of this chapter.  4.1 Acquisition and Storage  Big data comes along a new set of challenges to collect and store data efﬁciently. Compared to existing methods, Big data analytics need to deal with huge amounts of heterogeneous and unstructured data. It is not a trivial task to collect, integrate, and store these data by traditional data mining techniques and relevant infrastructures. These phenomena led the researchers to open a newer branch called Big data acquisition and storage. Next, the Big data acquisition and storage management is discussed.  4.1.1 Big Data Acquisition  Data acquisition is the process to aggregate information in a well-organized digital form for further storage and analysis. It is a combination of data collection, data transmission, and data preprocessing. Due to the fastest-growing sensor technology such as the Internet of Things  IoT  and radio-frequency identiﬁcation  RFID , sensor-based data collection has become quite popular data acquisition approach [1–4]. However, due to the high initial investment for installation and maintenance creates a barrier in the Big data environment.  To avoid high expenditure, crowd-driven data collection was suggested by some researchers as an alternative to sensor-based data collection. The incorporation of the crowd workers in the data acquisition process helps reduction of noisy data and the collection of new types of data. There are a number of examples of crowd-driven data acquisition which are summarized below:   Big Data Analytics for Intelligent Internet of Things  115  – FixMyStreet [27]: Users can specify the spatial location of any given street on a  map and report problems associated with the location.  – Ushahidi [28]: Provides real-time data collection by enabling data collection  from different channels such as email, social media, etc.  – EcoTop [29]: Reduces the noise during data collection by issuing rewards to the  mobile crowd workers.  These platforms provide incentives for peer collaboration among the crowd workers to achieve data availability and quality [4]. After the data collection step, Big data is required to be transmitted to the data centre for cleaning, processing, and integration. The transmission of Big data is posed to a set of challenges such as input output bottlenecks, network trafﬁc delays, and data replication [4]. To overcome these challenges, researchers adopt various approaches to improve the efﬁciency of Big data transmission [13]. Another major challenge of Big data analytics is the integration of heterogeneous unstructured data collected from different sources. Data accessibility, common data platform, and consolidated data model were identiﬁed as three key levels of data integration [4]. Many researchers have proposed their approaches and platforms based on these levels.  4.1.2 Big Data Storage  The next step after Big data acquisition  combination of collection and transmission  is storage. The main functionality of data storage is to store and manage Big datasets with reliability and availability [4]. Infrastructure and data storage management are two basic parts of data storage [17].  – Infrastructure: Traditional infrastructure for data storage includes random access memory  RAM , magnetic disks, and storage class memory [20, 21]. Due to the speciﬁc performance of these infrastructures, it is a challenge to combine all these for Big data environment. The transmission of large amounts of data from hard disks to memory often limits the performance of Big data analytics [22]. Considering a network architecture, the data storage infrastructure can be categorized [18] as direct-attached storage  DAS , network-attached storage  NAS , and storage area network  SAN . These architectures are unable to support Big data analytics. However, storage virtualization proposed by Hasan and Al-Turjman [30] offers a way to accommodate the requirements of Big data analytics. Storage virtualization is the combination of multiple network storage devices that become a single storage unit [31] and allows Big data to be easily searched and linked through a single source. Thus, data can be transferred consistently regardless of the physical infrastructure reducing the cost of storage and easier Big data analysis [32].  – Data storage management: Data storage management focuses on the ﬁle systems and database technology [33]. Google designed the Google File System  GFS  for large distributed data-intensive applications [34]. By reducing the cost of hardware, it is able to provide fault tolerance and high performance [4]. GFS   116  M. Ahmed et al.  lacks efﬁciency for small-sized ﬁles, and some other systems such as Hadoop Distributed File System [35], Kosmos distributed ﬁle system [36], and few others were developed to fulﬁl the requirements of Big data storage. The variety and volume features of Big data are the important challenges to traditional relational database systems. None Structured Query Language  NoSQL  is a new type of database modelled using means other than the tabular relations [37] where the key characteristics are partition tolerance, high availability [4]. Therefore, NoSQL is a good solution for Big data storage management. Most popular NoSQL databases are SimpleDB, Cassandra, HBase, Bigtable [38], and MongoDB [39]. Other than these solutions for storage management for Big data, many researchers proposed their own solutions based on these NoSQL databases.  4.2 Programming Model  Big data processing is the next challenge after handling the storage issue. According to Pino et al. [40], there are four primary requirements involved in Big data processing as shown in Fig. 4. A number of solutions are available to fulﬁl these requirements. Speciﬁcally, the available programming models are designed to map applications to the parallel environment. Traditional parallel models lack the scalability and fault tolerance required by Big data [26]. These led to the development of new architectures like MapReduce [40], PreGel, GraphLab, Dryad [41], and so on. Most popular model is the MapReduce paradigm due to its robust Big data handling approaches. We brieﬂy discuss the MapReduce below.  MapReduce is a Big data programming model that uses a wide variety of clusters to achieve automatic parallel processing and distribution. The computing  Fig. 4 Big data programming models   Big Data Analytics for Intelligent Internet of Things  117  model contains a map function and a reduce function. The job of map function is to partition large computational tasks into smaller tasks and assign them to the appropriate key pair. After obtaining the output of the map function, the reduce function merges all values which share the same key value and generates a set of merged output values. The basic idea of MapReduce is to split a Big task into several chunks and execute the chunks in parallel to optimize. In the MapReduce model, the user only needs to focus on these above-mentioned two functions  map and reduce . As a popular and powerful programming model, MapReduce has been widely deployed to solve Big data-related problems such as in distributed computation, online aggregation, database system optimization, high-performance computing, DNA sequencing, text analytics, and many more.  Dryad is another framework for parallel applications [41] similar to MapReduce. In this model, a task is represented as a directed acyclic graph  DAG  which includes vertices and channels. Dryad completes the task by executing the vertices of the graph on a set of high-end computers and communicating through data channels. As a variant of MapReduce, Dryad generalizes MapReduce to arbitrary DAGs. This feature makes Dryad more ﬂexible for the Big data applications with different structures [4].  One negative aspect of the MapReduce and Dryad models is that some agendas like behaviour abstraction, application optimization, and system simulation and migration are not well approached. These lead to a need for a generalized model that can bridge applications and various software frameworks for Big data analytics.  4.3 Benchmark  Advent of Big data in the scientiﬁc arena brings forth a newer set of benchmarking techniques among the researchers. The benchmarking techniques developed so far can be classiﬁed into two groups  component benchmarks and system benchmarks , and a simple taxonomy is shown in Fig. 5. The component benchmark has a limited scope and evaluates the performance of components in a Big data environment [4]. On the other hand, system benchmark focuses on the performance evaluation of an entire system [4].  Different types of benchmarking systems are discussed and summarized brieﬂy  below:  – PigMix [42], GridMix [43], GraySort [44]: The Standard Performance Evalua-  tion Corporation  SPEC ’s central processing unit  CPU  benchmark [4]  – TeraSort [45] TeraSort  benchmark for Apache Hadoop system [17]  measures the amount of time to sort a large amount of distributed data in a given system. It has three parts as generation, sorting, and validation. The generation part creates random data. The sorting part performs the sorting and writes sorted data to Hadoop’s distributed ﬁle system. The validation function reads sorted data to verify if it is in order.   118  M. Ahmed et al.  Fig. 5 Big data benchmarking  – Yahoo! [46] Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark  YCSB  tries to bridge the gap of the existing benchmarking systems which were only designed for databases such as SQL. YCSB contains an extensible workload generator and several core workloads. The open-source YCSB workload generator can be used to load and execute various datasets and workloads. System Transaction Processing Performance Council [47] TPC-C, TPC-E, TPC-H, and TPC-DS are the perfect tools to measure a Big data system’s ability for database loading and query executing.  – BigBench [48] It has two main components:  i  a data generator and  ii  query workload. The data generator helps to provide upgradeable volumes of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. The workload is devised with a set of queries that can cross different dimensions based on data.  4.4 Big Data Analytics  Data analytics is an important aspect of a successful IoT and in the dawn of Big data era; its importance has been being observed as never before. Organizations are interested in information from massive data to bring values. In this chapter, taxonomy is shown as in Fig. 6 based on the type of analysis being practised.   Big Data Analytics for Intelligent Internet of Things  119  Fig. 6 Types of analytics  Because of the characteristics of Big data discussed in Sect. 3, different analytical architectures shall be considered for different application requirements.  4.4.1 Timeliness of Analysis  According to timeliness requirements, Big data analysis can be classiﬁed into online and ofﬂine analysis. These are discussed as follows:  – Online Analysis: From the IoT perspective, the online analysis is extremely important as the deployed sensors are constantly collecting data. Therefore from a particular time frame, it is necessary to analyse the data collected to reach out to any decision on anomalous event detection, cybersecurity assurance, etc. Also, in other applications such as e-commerce, ﬁnancial trading data constantly changes, and rapid data analysis is needed. The widely accepted architectures for   120  M. Ahmed et al.  online analysis include  i  parallel processing clusters using traditional relational databases and  ii  memory-based computing platforms. For example, Greenplum from EMC and HANA from SAP are both real-time analysis architectures [4, 16].  – Ofﬂine Analysis: Ofﬂine analysis is usually required for applications without high requirements on response time, e.g. machine learning, statistical analysis, and recommendation algorithms [4, 16, 26]. Ofﬂine analysis carried out by retrieving data into a special platform through Big data acquisition tools. In the Big data environment, it is important to have specialized platforms to reduce the cost of data processing and improve the efﬁciency of data acquisition. Such platforms include the open-source tool Scribe from Facebook [4, 16], LinkedIn’s open-source tool Kafka [4], Hadoop [17], and so on. These tools are capable of meeting the demands of ofﬂine data analysis with hundreds of MB per second.  4.4.2 Analysis at Different Levels  Big data analysis can also be classiﬁed into memory-level analysis, business intelligence  BI  level analysis, and massive level analysis, which are brieﬂy discussed below:  – Memory-level analysis: When the data volume is smaller than the maximum memory of a cluster, this type of analysis is required. In recent times, the memory of server cluster surpasses hundreds of gigabytes. As a result, an internal database technology is advisable to use to improve the analytical efﬁciency. For online analysis, memory-level analysis is extremely suitable. A representative memory- level analytical architecture is MongoDB [39]. In the age of SSD  solid-state drive , the capacity and performance of memory-level data analysis have been further improved and widely applied.  – Business intelligence  BI  analysis: This analysis is required when the data scale surpasses the memory level; however, it can be imported into the BI analysis environment. The currently mainstream BI products are provided with data analysis plans to support the level over TB [4, 16].  – Massive analysis: When the BI analysis and traditional analysis are overwhelmed by the Big data, it is required to introduce the technologies like Hadoop and MapReduce to store and analyse the data. In recent times, most massive analysis utilizes HDFS of Hadoop to store data and use MapReduce for data analysis. Most massive analysis belongs to the ofﬂine analysis category.  4.4.3 Analysis with Different Complexity  The time and space complexity of Big data analysis algorithms varies from each other due to Big data characteristics  variety  and also application demands. For   Big Data Analytics for Intelligent Internet of Things  121  example, for the applications that require parallel processing, a distributed algorithm may be designed, and a parallel processing model may be used for data analysis [16, 26].  4.5 Tools for Big Data Mining and Analysis  A wide range of tools for Big data analytics are available which includes profes- sional, expensive commercial software and also open-source software [4]. This section covers top ﬁve Big data analytics tool widely used in the community according to a survey of “What Analytics, Data mining, Big Data software that you used in the past 12 months for a real project?” of 798 professionals made by KDnuggets in 2012 [49].  4.5.1 R  R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics [50]. It is a predecessor of the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories. R can be considered as a different implementation of S. R provides a wide variety of statistical techniques including linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classiﬁcation, clustering, etc. and is highly extensible. Furthermore, in a survey of “Design languages you have used for data mining analysis in the past year” in 2012, R was also in the ﬁrst place, defeating SQL and Java. Due to the popularity of R, database manufacturers, such as Teradata and Oracle, have released products supporting R. Programming with Big data in R  pbdR  is a series of R packages and an environment for statistical computing with Big data by using high-performance statistical computation [4, 16]. The pbdR uses the same programming language as R with S3 S4 classes and methods which is used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software.  4.5.2 Excel  MS Excel is the most commonly used and powerful data processing and statistical analysis tool. Excel becomes a resourceful Big data analytics tool when some advanced plug-ins, such as Analysis ToolPak and Solver Add-in, with powerful functions for data analysis are integrated. This plug-ins can be used only if users enable them. Excel is also the only commercial software among the top ﬁve [49].   122  4.5.3 RapidMiner  M. Ahmed et al.  RapidMiner [51] is an open-source software used for data mining, machine learning, and predictive analysis. However, to explore the Big data analytics, it is required to have licensed version which is not free. In an investigation of KDnuggets in 2011, it was more frequently used than R  ranked Top 1 . Data mining and machine learning programs provided by RapidMiner include extract, transform, and load  ETL , data preprocessing and visualization, modelling, evaluation, and deployment. The data mining ﬂow is described in XML and displayed through a graphic user interface  GUI . RapidMiner is written in Java. It integrates the learner and evaluation method of Weka and works with R. A handsome amount of regularly used data mining and machine learning algorithms can be implemented with connection of processes including various operators.  4.5.4 KNMINE  KNIME  Konstanz Information Miner  is a user-friendly and open-source data integration, processing, and analysis platform [52]. It provides the users to create data ﬂows in a visualized manner and to selectively run analytical processes along with the analytical results, models, and interactive views. KNIME was written in Java and contains a large number of plug-ins. Through plug-in ﬁles, users can insert processing modules for ﬁles, pictures, and time series and integrate them into various open-source projects, e.g. R and Weka. In addition, it is easy to expand KNIME. Developers can effortlessly expand various nodes and views of KNIME.  4.5.5 Weka  Weka, developed by University of Waikato researchers, which comes from Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis, is an open-source machine learning and data mining software written in Java [53]. Weka provides almost all the fundamental functions such as data processing, feature selection, classiﬁcation, regression, clustering, association rule, visualization, etc.  4.6 Applications of Big Data  The incorporation of Big data analytics makes it easier for organizations to gain meaningful information for being successful in their venture. Big data from various sources such as websites, emails, mobile devices, and social media are all important   Big Data Analytics for Intelligent Internet of Things  123  for knowledge extraction. In recent times, Big data has attracted a lot of attention from academia and industry which is easily understood by the amount of research paper published and job advertisements for data analyst scientists. In [26], it is mentioned that the most common applications of Big data are in business, social, and scientiﬁc applications. A brief discussion on these areas along with IoT is given below.  4.6.1 Business Applications  There are huge amounts of operational and ﬁnancial data stored at millions of different data sources in the business organizations. Big data analytics provides more agility to ﬁrms and makes it easier for ﬁrms to collect and analyse operational and ﬁnancial data. Valuable information from Big data analytics allows managers to make more successful decision and identiﬁcation of market conditions. Big data analytics have been already incorporated in various areas such as customer behaviour analysis, purchasing patterns, supply chain management, market fore- casting, risk management, and fraud detection. In summary, Big data analytics empowers the business organizations to create new products and business processes, expand customer intelligence, and increase revenue.  4.6.2 Social Applications  Big data analytics facilitate information sharing in society, detect correlations among social events, and aggregate and analyse information to assist decision- making [26]. Out of many applications of Big data analytics for social good, a timely example of Big data analytics has been observed in election campaigns. With the help of Big data analytics, political data analytics advanced from simple micro targeting to true predictive data science, and the track record is good according to Jon Markman who is an investment adviser, trader, columnist, and author. In education sector, a number of research projects are ongoing to develop new algorithms for student behaviour analysis and effective mode of learning and teaching. Hidden patterns and trends identiﬁed using Big data analytics techniques can provide educators with valuable insights for the evaluation of the learning process. Additionally, human behaviours can be analysed through gathered Big data from a variety of sources. The modelling of human behaviours will allow governing body to interpret and predict social events such as trafﬁc distribution, civil unrest incidents, and disease outbreaks. In the healthcare sector, Big data analytics provides the intelligence for electronic health records  EHRs  by connecting operational and clinical analytic systems and supports evidence-based healthcare. Evidence-based healthcare encompasses the systematic reviewing of previous clinical data in order to provide decision-makers with information as well as predictive analytics.   124  M. Ahmed et al.  4.6.3 Scientiﬁc Applications  The continuous development of Big data analytics supports scientists to access large amounts of data quickly, facilitate data collection and sharing, and discover hidden patterns in Big datasets. Currently, Big data analytics has been applied in a lot of research areas. Especially in astronomy disciplines, Big data analytics has proven to be an efﬁcient tool to address multiwavelength, multi-messenger, and huge amounts of astronomical data. NASA uses Big data analytics for real-time data processing on the ﬂight operations. There are thousands of scientiﬁc applications where Big data analytics is being used and new inventions are in place.  4.6.4 Application of Intelligent IoT-Based Big Data  IoT is undoubtedly an important source of Big data and, simultaneously, one of the major market shares of Big data applications. As sensors are being used across almost every industry, the IoT is going to trigger a massive inﬂux of Big data. IoT is going to have the biggest impact in the future of Big data analytics. A simple example may be given by logistic enterprises that may have profoundly experienced with the application of IoT Big data. In this scenario, the delivery vehicles of DHL may be equipped with sensors, wireless adapters, and GPS, so the headquarter is able to pinpoint the location. In addition to that application, supervision and management of employees can be executed with optimized performances.  5 Conclusion and Research Directions  In this chapter, the relationship between IoT and Big data is explored as the technological advances are inevitable. The Big data generated from IoT requires proper management and analysis to make IoT successful. Therefore, the importance of Big data analytics in IoT is a challenge. This chapter covers the Big data terminologies in the light of IoT and discusses the taxonomy of Big data analytics. Finally the chapter ﬁnishes with a set of research directions for the collaborative Big IoT data analytics. This chapter is going to be useful resource for anyone who is interested in IoT analytics and can be used as reference for graduate research students. In the next few subsections, the research direction of Big IoT data analytics is provided.  The Big data analytics research is in its early stage as the era just started few years ago and is confronting many challenges in different areas. Signiﬁcant research efforts are required to improve the efﬁciency of Big data analytics. It is indeed an interesting research area with great potential, and there are many important problems to be solved by the collaboration of both academia and industry. There is a universal deﬁnition required for Big data. As observed in Sect. 2 of this chapter, the researchers technology organizations are yet to reach to an agreed deﬁnition of Big   Big Data Analytics for Intelligent Internet of Things  125  data. An accepted formal deﬁnition is urgent for a variety of application domains to correlate Big data.  The presence of Big data challenges the traditional data management approaches. Currently, a plethora of research contributions on Big data technologies including data acquisition, storage, programming, benchmarking, and analytics are made. However, in the way the Big data is growing forth, it is imperative to continue research and development of relevant technologies.  As highlighted in the IoT perspective, the value gained from Big data is far higher than the value of non-Big dataset! As a result, the integration of different data sources  as in Big data  is a prerequisite for a successful venture nowadays. Moreover, the integration is posed too many challenges, such as different data patterns, redundant data, etc.  In Big data environment, the traditional security and privacy providers are insufﬁcient. Since the data volume is fast growing, safety risks are more than ever before, and the existing security measures are not suitable for Big data. The Big data privacy is concerned with the protection of data acquisition patterns, i.e. personal interests, properties, etc. of users, and the privacy of data which may be leaked during storage, transmission, and usage, even if acquired with the permission of users. In a nutshell, as the Big data emerges, it is vital to ensure its security and privacy. A lack of data security and privacy can cause detrimental effects such as great ﬁnancial losses and reputational damage for any organization.  References  1.

Dogo, Abdulazeez Femi Salami, Nnamdi I. Nwulu, and Clinton O. Aigbavboa  1 Introduction  Water is a critical commodity that connects every aspect of the day-to-day running of cities and communities with direct sociopolitical and economic implications. With projected population explosion, rapid urbanization and climate change induced by the volatility of weather patterns across the globe calls for efﬁcient ways of conserving, utilizing, and managing of the dwindling water resource [53], particularly in emerging economies such as the African region. It is estimated that 70% of world population will live in cities in water-stressed regions by the year  E. M.

According to the United Nations  UN  world population prospects, 2017 revision, Europe’s population will shrink by 26 million between 2017 and 2050, whereas Africa’s population will grow by 1.27 billion over the same period, which makes Europe’s challenge tiny in comparison to Africa’s.  Internet of Things  IoT  stands out as the core technology and solution to address water conservation and management issues, through digitization and building in intelligence in the water management system, to address water insecurity and attaining the 2030 United Nations’ target for the Sustainable Development Goal  SDG 6  on clean water and sanitation [64].  IoT has dramatically changed the way we interact with each other and the environment and provides us with a better way of understanding what’s going on around us. IoT is also playing a central role in making our cities and infrastructure more intelligent. It is projected by Cisco Internet Business Solutions Group  IBSG  that the number of interconnected IoT devices will reach 50 billion by 2020, just two  2  years from now, and with an even higher prediction by ARM, a semiconductor and software design company, of 1 trillion IoT devices by 2035. Despite all the promises IoT provides, a key concern about IoT technology is centered around security and privacy of the data continuously being generated by these large-scale sensing devices [25, 55], heterogeneity of devices, scalability, power efﬁciency and interoperability, and standardization of network communication protocols [51]. Many researchers have proposed several ways of tackling these IoT challenges such as in [46, 63], for real-time IoT [10] and in Industrial Internet of Things  IIoT  industry application scenario [2]. However, there are still unresolved issues and challenges especially with security and privacy owing to the decentralized topology of IoT devices that are constantly prone to physical and cyberattacks due to the sensitive information generated and transmitted by these smart and resource- constrained devices [18].  In [46], researchers identiﬁed the following speciﬁc security threats to IoT  sensors deployed in an intelligent water management system  IWMS :    Physical attack on sensor devices deployed in remote ﬁeld locations   Network hacking and jamming, device cloning, and eavesdropping   Challenge with securely updating ﬁrmware of sensors already deployed in the  ﬁeld Issue with secure and trusted communication between devices     Blockchain, a peer-to-peer  P2P  distributed ledger technology  DLT , is emerg- ing as a viable option to improve on the security and other technical challenges of IoT by integrating it with IoT devices to provide a secure network communication platform in a decentralized and distributed architectural arrangement, away from the traditional centralized databases in a cloud-centric design that most IoT has been built upon [15, 19, 59].  The chapter seeks to explore the impact of the combined usage of blockchain and IoT technologies on intelligent water management system  IWMS  through an African perspective. This chapter also summarizes security solutions speciﬁcally designed for IWMS and discusses some use case scenarios that could beneﬁt from   Blockchain and Internet of Things-Based Technologies for Intelligent Water. . .  131  the hybridization of these two technologies. Although there are works in literature on blockchain-IoT integration [4, 12, 25, 33, 35], to the best of our knowledge, there is currently no study of its applicability in the context of IWMS with an African view and perspective.  2 Overview of Background Concepts  In this section, an overview of the key concepts and technologies is given as it relates to intelligent water management system  IWMS .  2.1 Internet of Things  2.1.1 Technical Deﬁnition, Features, and Architecture  IoT is a broad and vast area of research encompassing numerous sets of intertwined ideas from different perspectives. It represents the coming together of several enabling technologies as IP-based networking, wireless communication, miniatur- ization as envisioned in Moore’s law, data analytics, and cloud computing [52], comprising people, machine, and information and having a direct and unprecedented impact on the society in so many ways. It is in light of this that it becomes challenging to give a holistic deﬁnition of IoT due to its complex characteristics, different perspectives, and deployment scale. Two deﬁnitions of IoT are adopted for the purpose of this chapter, which are based on deployment scale as proffered in [42] as follows:    Small-scaled IoT deployment: “An IoT is a network that connects uniquely identiﬁable “Things” to the Internet. The “Things” have sensing actuation and potential programmability capabilities. Through the exploitation of unique identiﬁcation and sensing, information about the “Thing” can be collected and the state of the ‘Thing’ can be changed from anywhere, anytime, by anything.”    Large-scaled IoT deployment: “Internet of Things envisions a self-conﬁguring, adaptive, complex network that interconnects ’things’ to the Internet through the use of standard communication protocols. The interconnected things have physical or virtual representation in the digital world, sensing actuation capabil- ity, a programmability feature and are uniquely identiﬁable. The representation contains information including the thing’s identity, status, location or any other business, social or privately relevant information. The things offer services, with or without human intervention, through the exploitation of unique identiﬁca- tion, data capture and communication, and actuation capability. The service is exploited through the use of intelligent interfaces and is made available anywhere, anytime, and for anything taking security into consideration.”   132  Fig. 1 Simpliﬁed IoT functional architecture  E. M. Dogo et al.  Applications  Networking and Data  Communications  Sensing  IoT has the following characteristics and features:  Interconnection of devices and between devices and the Internet      Devices have unique identiﬁer, such as IP and MAC addresses   Sensing and actuation capabilities     Self-conﬁgurability and programmability  Inbuilt intelligence  Since smart devices are broad and diverse such as sensors, RFIDs, smart phone, and people, it becomes more glaring and challenging to have a single and common IoT reference model that is applicable to all domains and scenarios. However, a common and simpliﬁed three-layered IoT functional reference architecture compris- ing of physical sensing devices, network with data communication, and application layers, as depicted in Fig. 1, is adopted in many literatures. It is worth mentioning the study by researchers in [51], where an IoT-based reference architecture is proposed for various smart water management processes by using a model developed for a project to establish water management standardization applied in irrigation, known as MEGA, and adopting an existing standard from the manufacturing and logistic domains for the control of processes, known as Object Linking and Embedding for Process Control Uniﬁed Architecture  OPC UA . The aim of this study was to deﬁne a feasible and all-encompassing industrial standard for water management processes.  2.1.2  IoT Technical Issues and Challenges  IoT can be beneﬁcial to water management in the following ways: water leakage detection, water quality and security monitoring, transparency on consumption and awards of water contracts, predictive maintenance on infrastructure, and more efﬁcient water management system through smart metering system. Despite these beneﬁts that IoT offers, there are still some issues with IoT implementation mainly bordering around security and privacy, regulatory and legal concerns, standards   Blockchain and Internet of Things-Based Technologies for Intelligent Water. . .  133  and interoperability, and developmental issues in emerging economies [52]. These mentioned issues are brieﬂy explained:    Security and Privacy Issues: With rapid entrenchment of IoT in virtually all spheres of our daily lives, concerns are being raised as to degree of security and privacy of the data generated, transmitted, and analyzed over the Internet by these sensing devices, as well as the access rights of this sensitive information. Commonly known cyberattacks on IoT devices include DDoS attack, hacking, data theft, and remote hijacking. Interoperability and Standardization: This issue arises due to a combination of multiple technologies that make up the IoT ecosystem, such as sensor technology, wireless communication, embedded system, cloud computing and virtualization, and IoT hardware design considerations.       Regulatory, Legal, and Right Issues: This issue is related to the way data continuously generated by IoT devices is being utilized, as well as who have access to the data, especially if the data is stored and analyzed across international borders with different jurisdictions from where the data is being generated, raising concerns about user rights, information misuse, and legal liabilities.    Emerging Economy and Developmental Issues: The IoT hold promise to improve on the economic, political, and social status of emerging and developing nations, just as with the developed ICT economies. However, to realize the full potentials of IoT, the unique African challenges must be taken into consideration.  Readers are referred to [28, 42, 52] and for detailed discussion on technical IoT  concept, challenges, standardization, and economy prospects.  2.2 Blockchain  2.2.1 Technical Deﬁnition and Features  Blockchain is a peer-to-peer  P2P  distributed ledger technology  DLT  for trans- parent transaction devoid of a trusted intermediary that leverages on the Internet, originally developed for cryptocurrency virtual currency transactions. The concept and idea were ﬁrst proposed in [22] on time-stamping of a digital document, before it was later called blockchain in [44]. Blockchain is deﬁned as an appendable immutable universally distributed open ledger [36]. The key elements of this deﬁnition rest with the keywords: appendable means can add to the ledger, immutable means nothing can be deleted or altered from the ledger, and universally distributed means equal accessibility of everyone in the network to the same copy of the ledger each time information is updated to ensure validity of all transactions called blocks. This makes a blockchain trustworthy and an open ledger database where all transactions  blocks  are recorded in a clear, shared, and transparent manner securely linked together using cryptography. We refer readers to [6, 14, 44] for details on blockchain technology.   134  E. M. Dogo et al.  Currently, many blockchain start-ups are springing up in Africa [7] as shown in Table 1, mostly in the banking and ﬁnancial sector, rightly so, because of its origin from the cryptocurrency virtual currency world. We however envision these and other new start-ups venturing into the water management ecosystem.

One key challenge is the loss of water in the distribution network due to pipe bursts, technically known as non-revenue water  NRW , which has direct effect on increased power consumption needed to pump water on the water utilities, ﬁnancial loss [56], as well as a heightened health risk on consumers. This calls for the use of sustainable technologies for intelligent water management in order to mitigate and proactively monitor the entire water system. Intelligent water system is the harmonious use of water among people, industry, and the environment in a sustainable, safe, and secured water environment and supply service and contributing toward low energy consumption and carbon   Blockchain and Internet of Things-Based Technologies for Intelligent Water. . .  137  Fig. 2 Intelligent water system conceptual framework [26]  emission [61]. Smart water network is an integrated set of products, solutions and systems that enable utilities to remotely and continuously monitor and diagnose problems, pre-emptively prioritize and manage maintenance issues and use data- driven insights to remotely control and optimize all aspects of the water distribution network, as well as comply transparently and conﬁdently with regulatory and policy requirements on water quality and conservation and provide water customers with the information and tools they need to make informed choices about their behaviors and water usage patterns [56]. The overall objective of smart water solutions includes smart measuring and monitoring across the water distribution, enhanced security, better analysis of the generated data, and enhanced revenue and efﬁciency [56]. Figure 2 depicts Hitachi’s [26] conceptual intelligent water management system which integrates smart supervisory control, instrumentation, information management, and water treatment system, taking into consideration the balance between people and environment in the water environment, ensuring that demand for safe and stable water supply is met in conjunction with concrete environmental conservation strategies for the entire water cycle – water resource cycle, water use, and recycling. In addition to this, practical efforts are as well made to ensure maintenance management of the utility’s infrastructure and overall operating efﬁciency using information and communications technology  ICT .   138  E. M. Dogo et al.  3 Blockchain-IoT Solutions for Smart Water Management  3.1 Overview of Global Perspective  As a result of the recent increase in cases of droughts, ﬂoods, hurricanes, and tsunamis, governmental agencies and private bodies around the world are now com- pelled to devise smart measures and build sustainable infrastructures for ensuring water security and management [21, 41]. This goal of implementing pragmatic solutions for securing the quality and quantity of water in rural regions and urban areas is still a technologically challenging task which has been successfully tackled in select developed ICT economies like Australia and Singapore [38, 43, 50].  In Australia, the South East Queensland  SEQ  water grid was established as an integrated system for managing and securing urban water supply [38, 43, 51]. This smart integrated system consists of water demand forecasting platforms, water reservoirs and connected dams, water treatment installations, desalination plants, water pumping stations, duplex pipelines for two-way water movement, and, most importantly, a wide range of water sources through recycling, desalination, and precipitation rainwater [11, 38, 43]. The key beneﬁt of incorporating alternative sources of water supply in the SEQ water grid is to curb scarcity and achieve climate resiliency and critical crisis prevention [11, 51, 57].  In Singapore, the water supply network  WSN  of the Public Utilities Board  PUB  was set up to contrive a self-sufﬁcient network for water management through a holistic process that involves water collection, reclamation, production, and distribution [1, 38, 48]. This holistic process was implemented through the nationwide deployment of smart sensors for real-time monitoring and analytic tools for decision support system in order to achieve an effective and sustain- able water supply network management [38, 43]. The operational focus of this smart water grid are water quality monitoring  real-time monitoring, event pre- diction, and demand forecasting , water conservation  recycling, prevention of wastage, and optimum usage , automated meter reading  real-time water util- ity information updates , leak management  leaks faults detection and preventive maintenance , and asset infrastructure management  risk management platform development, data mining, and database integration  [1, 43]. WSN also employs a wide range of water sources such as desalinated brine seawater, harvested rainwater, reclaimed water, and stormwater. This smart water grid consists of water reclamation plants, desalination plants, duplex pipelines, water reservoirs, waste management system, and other core integral infrastructures [1, 38].  3.2 African Perspective  The pace of smart water grid development and intelligent water management in Africa is still very slow due to endemic issues associated with limited access to   Blockchain and Internet of Things-Based Technologies for Intelligent Water. . .  139  clean water and lack of reliable water supply sources [8, 30, 32]. In addition to this, rapid population growth coupled with climate change and other catalysts of water insecurity such as reckless industrial practices, inconsistent water policies, loose water quality control, feeble infrastructure, intentional pipeline damages, poor maintenance culture, high operational costs, huge water utility bills charges, wanton domestic water wastage, and frequent uncontrolled water losses has subjected many Africans living in urban and rural areas to perennial water scarcity and other severe water-stressed conditions [4, 20, 23, 39, 40]. The implication of these existing challenges is that about 50% of the water supply is inevitably lost before reaching the domestic and industrial consumers in Africa. Nonetheless, there are genuine efforts recently geared toward intelligent water management in Africa [8, 58].  In Kenya, HydroIQ is an indigenous innovation from Hydrologistics Africa  Techstars Company  [8]. This solution operates as a water virtual network operator  WNVO  by incorporating smart automated metering device into the existing traditional water supply network [47]. The WNVO relies on analytic tools, IoT, and payment automation [8, 47]. Consequently, this smart device integration transforms the old traditional water infrastructure into smart water grids by infusing intelligence into water distribution and allowing real-time pipeline condition monitoring for leaks faults, water pressure, and water quality [8, 47]. In addition to this, by setting up and installing this technology at households, it makes it possible to monitor and control domestic water consumption, thereby allowing local consumers to pay for only the consumed quantity on a pay-as-you-go  PAYG  basis using mobile payment or any other preferred electronic payment channel [8, 47].  In Kyuso, a largely rural district of Kenya, Oxford University researchers implemented the idea of harnessing the pervasive and penetrative powers of mobile networks for indicating when hand pumps are dysfunctional or nonfunctional [31]. These smart hand pumps rely on pump handle movement, mobile data transmitter, water ﬂow measurement, real-time hourly water usage reporting, database pro- cesses, information processing, pump location estimator, backbone central server, and online pump condition alerts [31].  Another innovative solution is the MajiData developed by Kenya’s Ministry of Water and Irrigation in conjunction with Water Services Trust Fund and in cooperation with the German Development Bank  KfW , German Cooperation for International Cooperation  GIZ , United Nations Human Settlements Programme  UN-Habitat , and Google [31]. Aided by satellite imagery, this online database service provides vital data on slums and low-income areas for water boards and water service providers in order to systematically plan and implement effective water distribution and sanitation schemes for the slums and urban low-income areas [31]. Another case worth mentioning is the technological cooperation and intervention of Culligan  United States Water Treatment Company  in Kigali, Rwanda, to build a smart water grid for the area [49].   140  E. M. Dogo et al.  3.3 Blockchain-IoT Conceptual Framework  Cloud computing has been an enabling technology for IoT for storage, processing, and analysis of data generated by IoT sensing devices in real time. However, with the proliferation of IoT devices projected to reach over 50 billion mark in the near future, coupled with the assumptions of good Internet connectivity, high bandwidth, and low latency upon which cloud computing concepts have been built on, this cloud-centered architectural arrangement is no longer going to be optimally feasible. Other issues such as trust and transparency are also legitimate concerns raised by cloud computing stakeholders. Even though cloud computing over the years has evolved into new and complimentary concepts such as edge, fog, mist, and dew computing to enhance the capabilities of the cloud computing, most of these inherent challenges with cloud computing persist. Hence, the integration of blockchain and IoT is a promising synergy that could enhance the potential of IoT by providing security, trust, ﬁdelity, and conﬁdentiality in information sharing since the data will remain immutable, appendable in a universally distributed open ledger. Decentralization, scalability, identiﬁcation of nodes in a trustworthy manner, autonomy, reliability, security, and secured deployment of ﬁrmware into devices are some of the beneﬁts identiﬁed in [50] that the integration of blockchain-IoT promises. For blockchain-IoT integration in IWMS, we suggest a hybrid approach integration proposed in [50], where cloud computing together with its evolving new concepts like edge, fog, and mist computing could be incorporated into the design to play a complimentary role, as depicted in Fig. 3.

In technologically advanced countries, an innovative blend of green infrastruc- ture, gray infrastructure, and smart IoT solutions are employed, deployed, and strategically positioned to monitor stormwater, runoff volumes, peak ﬂows, and short-term and long-range weather conditions in order to take preventive, effec- tive, and sustainable measures for water recycling reuse, water conservation, and environmental protection [16, 29]. In this research context, gray infrastructure is the stock of engineered facilities and equipment such as water treatment plants, sewage system, and piped drainage system [16, 54]. On the other hand, green infrastructures are the eco-friendly structures like stormwater planters, urban tree canopies, constructed wetlands, green roofs, rainwater harvester, bio-retention facilities, downspout pipes, permeable pavements, detention ponds, retention basins, and land conservation schemes [16, 62]. The smart IoT infrastructures are usually autonomous devices with inbuilt intelligence for event sensing, condition mon- itoring, data caching storage, status reporting, and decentralized processing and, most importantly, equipped with seamless and real-time accessibility [3, 27, 45]. In these developed ICT economies, stormwater is considered as a vital resource, and the objectives of blending this tripartite infrastructure are to achieve effective stormwater channeling, storage for evacuation, treatment of water discharge, ﬂow regulation, reintegration, and reuse of stormwater [9, 45].  Current State and Opportunities: A pertinent use case scenario is that of Dogondoutchi city in Niger Republic where land reforms, hillside retention systems  half-moon terraces , desert reforestation, and inﬁltration systems  ﬁlter dykes  were used to control stormwater runoff and quell water stagnation issues in order to revitalize aquaculture, local farming, and irrigation [32]. Another relevant use case scenario is a project funded by the Danish International Development Agency  DANIDA  which is a technological partnership between the Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management  IGN , University of Copenhagen, Denmark, Institute of Human Settlements Studies  IHSS  at Ardhi University, Tanzania, and Ethiopian Institute of Architecture, Building Construction and City Development  EiABC  at Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia [62]. The initiative of this project is to introduce and implement the concept of landscape-based stormwater management  LSM  to the African cities of Dar es Salaam and Addis Ababa [62]. LSM entails adopting a robust green infrastructure coupled with adequate storage capacity for the retention, recycling, and reuse of accumulated stormwater runoff during rainy seasons in order to ensure sustainable and intelligent water management [62]. The practical implementation of the LSM employs local   142  E. M. Dogo et al.  retention structures, inﬁltration systems, land conservation schemes, and other green infrastructures pertinent to these African cities [62]. The beneﬁt of this eco-friendly approach is that it reduces ﬂood risks, revives urban water supply, can be easily used and managed by local consumers, and, most importantly, provides an alternative to the sewage system which is a gray infrastructure [62]. Another germane use case scenario is that of Atlantis town, Western Cape, South Africa, where stormwater is harvested by inﬁltrating the runoff into the local aquifer with the aid of two large retention ponds [9, 45]. The captured water is injected into a system of boreholes for reﬁnement, reintegration, and reuse in a process popularly known as aquifer recharge management [9, 45]. This intelligent water management technique has ensured sustainable and steady water supply in the region for many years [9, 45].  Recommendation – Public-Private Partnerships and Strong Linkages Between Rural Authorities and Urban Stakeholders: There is the urgent need for respective governments of different African countries to establish runoff monitoring and con- trol unit in strategic rural regions in order to reduce, reuse, and recycle stormwater and wastewater. This can only be achieved through the synergy of government agen- cies, corporate bodies, rural engineering departments, environmentalists, land use experts, sustainability specialists, industrial technologists, and other stakeholders.  Access to Up-to-Date Technologies, Management Knowledge, Knowhow, Tech- nical Information, Operational Data, and Vital Statistics: Local water authorities and agencies in different African countries need to genuinely and judiciously invest in green infrastructure, technical knowledge, reliable meteorological data collection, storage and analysis, technology management, analytic and forecasting tools, blockchain-IoT trends, sustainable water practices, and other indispensable innovations needed for stormwater management. This will reinforce and better equip the local water authorities to adopt predictive, proactive, and preventive measures for intelligent water management.  4.2 Water Quality Monitoring and Reporting  Technical Description and Existing Challenges: In most African cities, water quality monitoring and smart water metering is still lacking, and most water contamination cases are often detected and reported by the local consumers who have been already exposed to the hazard [5, 24]. It must be highlighted that water contamination occurs more in the water distribution system than in the treatment plants [5, 32]. Contamination in the water distribution system are as a result of colorization, microbial intrusion, disinfectant expiration, bioﬁlms, water staleness, pressure differentials, biochemical abnormalities, industrial accidents, treatment errors, storage wears, pipe stress and bursts, untidy pipe works, pipe corrosion, release of pollutants toxicants, and acts of sabotage [13, 60]. Apart from this, one of the biggest challenges to optimum water resource management, equitable water distribution, and reliable water access is the issue of losses attached to non-revenue water [5, 40]. Non-revenue water is as a result of unbilled autho-   Blockchain and Internet of Things-Based Technologies for Intelligent Water. . .  143  rized consumption  from unbilled un-metered consumption and unbilled metered consumption , physical losses  from storage leaks, transmission leakages, storage tanks overﬂow, distribution mains supply leakages, and metering service connection leaks , and commercial losses  from end-user meter inaccuracies, fraudulent manip- ulation, unauthorized consumption, systemic bugs, and data processing handling errors  [5, 40].  In developed countries, water quality monitoring in smart water grids is usually achieved by deployed multi-contaminant sensors and biosensors through physio- chemical measurement  to detect pH, optical properties, temperature, turbidity, ﬂow, electrical conductivity, chlorine content, oxidation reduction potential  ORP   and or microbial measurement  to detect toxicity  [3, 13]. These parameters are sensed in real time, measured with online instrumentation, and connected to microcontrollers for processing and analyzing the water quality data through event detection and forecasting systems [13, 58]. Local water authorities are then promptly alerted on the location and severity of the detected anomalies in order to take proper preventive actions [27, 60]. The real-time sensed data is also useful for continuous water sampling and hydraulic model calibration which is a replacement to the costly, monotonous, and tedious traditional calibration process [43, 48]. Speciﬁcally, smart water meters are used to effectively curb non-revenue water costs, control water wastage, and address pressure differentials, leakages, damages, fraud attempts, consumption rate problems, inaccessibility to account and con- sumption data, service quality issues, charging and billing issues, and uncontrolled water losses through smart pressure management processes, smart step testing, and other intelligent techniques [40, 60]. Smart valves are employed to prevent contaminant intrusion and cut off polluted water from mixing with potable water through contaminant isolation technique and smart ﬂood management schemes [40, 48]. Generally, smart water grids systemically integrate these automated meters, actuators, sensor array, controllers, and analytic tools for intelligent control and sustainable water management in order to ensure high-quality water supply is reliably and efﬁciently delivered only when and where it is needed [27, 40].  Current State and Opportunities: Power Ledger from Australia is pioneering a number of interesting and innovative blockchain-powered trading platforms for smart water metering data management, especially in the city of Freemantle [60]. With respect to water quality monitoring and smart water metering, the African market is growing with a good prospect due to the presence of important players coming up with innovative solutions to serve the purpose of intelligent water management. Some of these players are Junaco Trading from Kenya, Aqua-loc from South Africa, Maji Milele Limited from Kenya, Honeywell Elster in South Africa, Metron-Farnier from the United States of America, Amanzi Meters from South Africa, Ideal Prepaid from South Africa, Lesira-Teq Smart Metering from South Africa, Krohne in South Africa, PEC Africa from South Africa, Kamstrup from South Africa, and other technology players [5, 34]. For example, iMvubu from Amanzi Meters employs AMR and GSM for remote meter reading and provides equal treatment to all local consumers by restricting water consumption to a predetermined volume [5].   144  E. M. Dogo et al.  Generally, smart water metering coupled with water quality monitoring and control is garnering increasing attention and interest in Africa which is forcing local water authorities to take the issue of water conservation, fair accurate billing, and water management seriously. For instance, water authorities in Nairobi and Nyeri, Kenya, are now issuing meter readers equipped with utility mobile phones which are used in taking, sending, and storing snapshots of correct meter readings for veriﬁcation and validation purposes [5]. An improvement of this technology was developed which allows local consumers to read meters and cross-validate by simply taking and transmitting an iOS snapshot of the accurate reading to the central utility authorities [5]. In addition to this, some utility authorities in Durban, Dakar, Nairobi, and Nyeri are now incorporating GIS to check city population with respect to water consumption, monitor report on weather data and climatic conditions, plan service extension, monitor water pipes, and inspect domestic units connected to the water grid and other pertinent information [5].  Recommendation – Developing Multiservice Strategies and Integrated Man- agement Approaches: Water conservation schemes, quality monitoring initiatives, and quality control strategies should not be limited and restricted to the treatment plants, but these techniques should be systematically integrated network-wide  with the aid of IoT sensors, actuators, cognitive systems, and lightweight intelligent codes programs  in order to achieve end-to-end total quality management for the entire water supply network. This intelligent network will further enhance the performance of the smart water meters by providing a robust, reliable, and resilient water management that can cater for the immediate and future water demands of respective African cities and communities.  4.3 Smart Payment and Contract  Technical Description and Existing Challenges: In Africa, many entrepreneurs operating small- and medium-scale enterprises with the vision of tackling critical water challenges by developing innovative solutions are often restricted as a result of inaccessible loans and standard ﬁnancing channels from banks due to institutional bureaucracies and stringent collateral terms and conditions [11, 20, 50]. This central ﬁnancial authority bottleneck slows down innovation process and introduces high risks, veriﬁcation delays, and currency country barriers especially in scenarios where there is need for regional cooperation or international collaboration to enable the initial implementation and continued success of the smart water projects [11, 50]. Blockchain is a disruptive and explosive technology that can de-bureaucratize this centralized funding process and facilitate the growth of technological start-ups willing to produce enabling infrastructure, smart facilities, and key IoT solutions that will spur and sustain intelligent water management in Africa [20, 50].  Some developed nations are now developing innovative blockchain applications for water treatment contracts, smart payment, sharing utility data and facility information, water rights trading, and many other interesting applications [11].   Blockchain and Internet of Things-Based Technologies for Intelligent Water. . .  145  Smart payment in this context is done with the aid of a cryptocurrency where every smart water device has its own online “bank account” which is shareable with other devices and or consumers, and most importantly, micro-transactions enable automated compensation for water consumption [11, 20]. On the other hand, a smart contract is an inbuilt program in the blockchain network for automatically transferring cryptocurrencies between parties  consumers, smart water devices, and other relevant utility units  when certain stipulated conditions are fulﬁlled [11, 20]. Smart payments and contracts solve the existing inconsistencies and errors associated with the traditional performance evaluation, maintenance, and commer- cialization of water facilities [11, 50]. By adopting these smart methodologies, business transactions are seamlessly streamlined, costs are minimized, and fraud attempts are effectively checked prevented [11, 50].  Current State and Opportunities: In Australia, Civic Ledger developed a blockchain-powered P2P platform, Water Ledger that utilizes token management system and smart contract for monitoring water transactions and automatically updating records of state water departments [11]. OriginClear from the United States is developing an application called WaterChain which is a blockchain protocol that employs cryptocurrency and smart contracts to ensure service efﬁciency and operational transparency in the water treatment industry [11]. AQUAOSO from the United States is architecting blockchain to track ownership of water rights and also integrating smart contracts into existing solutions with the aid of IoT- enabled sensors to monitor water supply chain and quality of service delivery and ensure smart payments [3, 11]. In China, partnership between NW Blockchain Limited and Newater Technology is reached for managing water facilities plants and industrial wastewater projects through asset-based token sales [11]. In Senegal, Banque Regionale de Marches launched eCFA Franc cryptocurrency for West African Monetary Union in order to drive Internet of Intelligent Things to build and maintain key infrastructure for economic development [24]. In South Africa, Bankymoon launched a blockchain humanitarian platform that allows donors to top up speciﬁc schools’ meters from any location around the world [11]. Generally, blockchain technology can be integrated into smart meters in order to enable consumers to pay bills with cryptocurrencies and adopt sustainable water practices. Recommendation – Genuine Interest and Investment in Distributed Comput- ing and Blockchain-Powered IoT Engineering: Respective governments of differ- ent African countries need to urgently invest in remote-access data processing, data mining, tele-computing, computational intelligence, big data analytics, and blockchain-based IoT design methodologies. By doing this, transparency will be ensured, and all stakeholders  domestic consumers, industrial users, local water authorities, private investors, rural water managers, conservationists, policymakers, and other pertinent participants in the water sector  will have access to reliable, relevant, and recent data on water quality and quantity in order to formulate policies and make more informed decisions. This will also stem corrupt practices and fraudulent activities especially in scenarios where local water authorities have been bribed to tamper with water quality data and falsify consumption rates and charges. In addition to this, adopting these intelligent distributed computing techniques   146  E. M. Dogo et al.  will catalyze P2P water rights trading enabling local consumers with extra water resources to trade off this excess  or any saleable portion  without involving and relying on the central authority. This smart trading decision is often based on information on market trends, latest weather forecast data, long-range climatic predictions, and other bulk of processed data available and accessible through the Internet and or mobile devices. This will also boost market ﬁdelity outlook and open up novel invest opportunities, smart business models, and innovative ﬁnance strategies for start-ups and enterprises willing to integrate IoT, AI, and blockchain solutions into their products or designs in order to tackle existing water challenges in various African regions.  5 Conclusion  Blockchain and IoT are still in their developmental stage in Africa. The current trend suggests that blockchain and IoT with artiﬁcial intelligence will be dominant technologies in the near future. In this era of the 4IR, Africa must key into the numerous beneﬁts these technologies offer. One such area that could beneﬁt from this synergy is in the water industry; this of course stems from the fact that water connects every aspect of life and it is critical to the social and economic survival of the African region. There is no one-size-ﬁts-all solution to the water and sanitation crisis saddling the region; however, the integration of blockchain and IoT has the power to revolutionize water and sanitation management toward achieving SDG 6 as envisioned by the UN in 2035, through innovative, efﬁcient, scalable solutions, based on these two technologies. This will ensure that African cities are adequately prepared with technologies to respond and address the perennial challenges associated with water crisis, such as in Cape Town of recent and other parts of Africa in a sustainable and efﬁcient way.

Digital Forensics for Frame Rate Up-Conversion in Wireless Sensor Network  Wendan Ma and Ran Li  1 Introduction  With the rapid development of the industrial Internet and smart city, more and more wireless sensors are used to collect and exchange multimedia and video data. In applications of various industries, we can see that the transmission and exchange of video data are inevitable. In response to the development of the era, many methods for processing multimedia and video data have been proposed [1–3]. However, the rich temporal redundancy in video data is easy to be exploited by forgers, which makes the digital video face the threat of forgery. Especially in wireless sensor network, the massive data collected by nodes has to actively discard part of video frames during transmission due to limited bandwidth, and then the frame rate up- conversion  FRUC  [4] is implemented to restore video at the receiver. In order to ensure the users’ right to know the data integrity and to avoid inappropriate post- processing, it is necessary to design a digital forensics method to identify FRUC forgery [5].  Frame replication  FR  is the simplest FRUC method, which is used by some commercial video editing softwares  e.g., ImTOO, Video Edit Magic, etc.  because of its simplicity and ease of use. Aiming at FR forgery, the forgery traces can be found by analyzing the similarity between adjacent frames. For example, Bian et al. [6] quantify the inter-frame similarity by using structural similarity  SSIM  index [7]. Yang et al. [8] extract the feature of each frame and quantify the inter- frame similarity using the Euclidean distance between features. The periodicity of similarity indexes is a strong evidence of the FR forgery. The high frame rate of video produced by FR often appears ﬂickering and jerkiness, which is caused  W. Ma · R.

Li  by ignoring the motion between frames. Therefore, the more advanced method, motion-compensated FRUC  MC-FRUC  [9], is favored by forgers. MC-FRUC interpolates pixels along the motion trajectory, generating a smooth, clear, and comforting video, so it is a popular approach to increase frame rate. However, there is no periodic inter-frame similarity in these high-quality forged videos, which makes the forensics algorithm of detecting FR forgery invalid [6]. Bestagini et al. [10] take the lead in detecting MC-FRUC forgery. First, the suspicious video is down-sampled, and the frame average operator is used to increase the frame rate to obtain the detection video. Then, the variance is calculated frame by frame for the detected video and the suspicious video. Finally, the forgery evidence is obtained by analyzing the periodicity of variance. Bestagini’s algorithm achieves certain effects, but the algorithm must know the up-conversion factor. However, this condition cannot be met in most cases. Yang et al. [11–13] also explore the connection between some statistical features and interpolation frame operation, which improve the detection accuracy of MC-FRUC forgery. Since MC-FRUC can be implemented by different technical methods [14–16], the detection accuracy will be greatly degraded when the above MC-FRUC detection algorithm encounters complex high-precision forgery methods  e.g., multi-hypothesis motion estimation [16], post-texture rendering [17] . Especially after the forger conducts compression, de-noising, and other post-processing, the situation will get worse. Therefore, it is a large challenge to ensure the property stability of MC-FRUC forensics algorithm at present.  To improve the detection accuracy of MC-FRUC, this chapter proposes to measure the statistical variation of video data with edge feature. First, the Sobel operator is used to detect the edge of video frames. Then, the edge is quantiﬁed to obtain the edge complexity of each frame. Finally, the periodicity of the edge complexity along time axis is detected, and FRUC forgery is automatically identiﬁed by hard threshold decision. Experimental results show that the proposed forensics algorithm can effectively identify video sequences forged by different MC- FRUC methods. Especially after de-noising and compression attacks, the proposed algorithm can still ensure high detection accuracy.  The rest of this chapter is organized as follows. Section 2 brieﬂy describes the forensics of FR forgery and MC-FRUC. Section 3 presents the proposed forensics algorithm. Section 4 discusses the experimental results and analysis. We conclude this chapter in Section 5.  2 Background Knowledge  2.1 Forensics of FR Forgery  FR is to increase the frame rate of video by directly copying adjacent frames and inserting in the waiting time. That is, suppose the t-th frame is the interpolated frame, then   Digital Forensics for Frame Rate Up-Conversion in Wireless Sensor Network  153  Fig. 1 Example of FR forgery  f [t] = f [t + 1]   1  where f [t] is the interpolated frame and f [t + 1] is the adjacent original frame. As shown in Fig. 1, the frame rate of original video is increased by periodically inserting interpolated frame, which means that there are always video frames consistent with its contents near the interpolated frames. Therefore, it can be proved that the video has FR forgery as long as interpolated frames are found in the neighborhood of a certain time. The existing work adopts two detection methods, namely, residual detection [10] and similarity detection [6]. The abovementioned two detection methods are brieﬂy described below.  The residual detection method calculates the inter-frame residual energy of the  1. Residual detection t-th frame and its adjacent  t + 1 -th frame as follows: v [t] =  cid:5 f [t] − f [t + 1] cid:5 2  2   2  where ·2 is l2 norm. If f [t] is interpolated frame, v[t] is 0; otherwise, v[t] is not 0. Once the interpolated frame appears periodically, the residual energy will periodically generate the value 0. Therefore, as long as the periodic attenuation of the residual energy can be detected to be 0, it can be proved that there is FR forgery. In general, after the frame rate of original video is improved by FR, video coding systems  e.g., H.264, HEVC, etc.  are adopted to implement lossy compression on the forged video in order to reduce the data volume as much as possible, which will lead to a certain error between the compressed video frame and the original video frame. That is,   154   cid:16 f [t] = f [t] + e [t]  W. Ma and R. Li   3    cid:16 f [t + 1] = f [t + 1] + e [t + 1]   4  where  cid:16 f [t]and  cid:16 f [t + 1]are the compression frame of the t-th frame and the  t + 1 - th frame, respectively. e[t], e[t + 1] is the error term between  cid:16 f [t],  cid:16 f [t + 1] and its original frame, respectively. The residual energy between the compressed frames is calculated as follows:   cid:16 v [t] =  cid:29    cid:29   cid:16 f [t] −  cid:16 f [t + 1]   cid:29   cid:29 2 2  = v [t] +  cid:5 e [t] − e [t + 1] cid:5 2  2   5   When the forged frame encounters lossy compression, it can be seen from Eq.  5  that the residual energy of the compressed frame includes not only the residual energy of the original frame but also the error energy. The error term will vary randomly over time due to the different quality reductions of each compressed frame. Therefore, the lossy compression will interfere with the periodic variation of residual energy, thereby reducing the detection performance.  2. Similarity detection its adjacent  t + 1 -th frame as follows:  The similarity detection method calculates the SSIM value of the t-th frame and  s [t] = SSIM  f [t] , f [t + 1]  =  2μt μt+1 + c1  + c1  + μ2 t+1   cid:6  μ2 t   cid:7   cid:6  2λt,t+1 + c2  cid:7   cid:6  + λ2 + c2 t+1 λ2 t   cid:7    6   where μt and μt + 1 denote the mean value of f [t] and f [t + 1], respectively. λt and λt + 1 denote the variance of f [t] and f [t + 1], respectively. λt,t + 1 denotes the covariance of f [t] and f [t + 1]; c1 and c2 denote two constants. The SSIM value ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates that the two frames are identical. The smaller the value is, the less similar the two frames are. When the interpolated frame is inserted periodically, the SSIM value will periodically appear as value 1. Therefore, as long as the SSIM value can be detected to periodically increase to 1, it can be proved that there is FR forgery. It is inevitable that noise will be mixed in forged video during transmission. That is,  f [t] = f [t] + n [t]   7   f [t + 1] = f [t + 1] + n [t + 1]   8  where f [t] and f [t + 1] denote the noisy frame of the t-th frame and the  t + 1 -th frame, respectively. n[t] and n[t + 1] are noise terms, respectively. The SSIM value of the noisy frame is calculated as follows:   Digital Forensics for Frame Rate Up-Conversion in Wireless Sensor Network  155  s [t] = SSIM   cid:6  f [t] , f [t + 1]   cid:7  = s [t] + δ  n [t] , n [t + 1]    9  where δ n[t],n[t + 1]  is the interference value caused by the noise terms n[t] and n[t + 1]. When the forged frame is subjected to noise interference, it can be seen from Eq.  9  that the SSIM value of the noisy frame includes not only the SSIM value of the original frame but also the interference term. When the noise mixed in is too large, it is bound to affect the periodic variation of SSIM value, thus reducing the detection performance.  2.2 MC-FRUC  MC-FRUC is a video post-processing technology, which can realize inter-frame interpolation by predicting inter-frame motion estimation. MC-FRUC can effec- tively enhance motion continuity and improve the ﬂuency of video. By virtue of abundant original data in the video and high correlation along the motion trajectory, MC-FRUC has attracted wide attention from industry and academia. As shown in Fig. 2, MC-FRUC is mainly composed of motion estimation, motion vector smoothing, motion vector mapping, and motion-compensation interpolation. The ﬁrst three parts use the reference frames ft−1 and ft + 1 to generate the motion vector ﬁeld Vt of the current frame ft. The last part is to form the current frame estimation  cid:16 ft based on Vt. First, the motion estimation is used to generate the motion vector ﬁeld Vt−1 between ft−1 and ft + 1. Then, the motion vector smoothing corrects the abnormal motion existing in Vt−1 to obtain a smooth motion vector ﬁeld Vt−1, and Vt−1 is mapped to the current frame motion vector ﬁeld Vt by motion vector mapping. Finally, according to Vt, the matching pixel of any pixel in the current frame can be found in the reference frame, and the current frame is interpolated as follows:   cid:16 ft  i, j   = 1 2  ! ft−1   cid:4  i + V  , j + V   i,j   t,2   i,j   t,1   cid:5  + ft+1   cid:4  i − V  , j − V   i,j   t,2   i,j   t,1   cid:5 "   10   where  i, j  represents the pixel position and represents the motion vector of Vt at pixel position  i, j . The MC-FRUC interpolation accuracy mainly  , V  V   i,j   t,1   i,j   t,2   cid:4    cid:5   Fig. 2 Framework of MC-FRUC   156  W. Ma and R. Li  Fig. 3 Subjective visual quality comparison of the 98-th frame in Foreman sequence interpolated with different MC-FRUC strategies  depends on the accuracy of Vt; therefore a lot of works has focused on improving the performance of motion estimation and motion vector smoothing and mapping. For example, in [14], 3-D recursive search  3DRS  is adopted in motion estimation to reduce abnormal motion through implicit smoothing constraints; in [15], motion vector mapping is performed by using bidirectional motion symmetry assumption to avoid the problem of overlapping and holes; in [16], multi-hypothesis motion estimation is adopted to form a more accurate motion vector ﬁeld by the motion vector ﬁelds of different densities. Different strategies are used to realize the motion estimation part, which can provide the motion vector ﬁeld with different precision levels, so the interpolated frames with different visual qualities can be generated by Eq.  10 . As shown in Fig. 3, using the MC-FRUC method in [14–16] to restore the 98-th frame of the Foreman sequence in CIF format, it can be seen that the multi-hypothesis motion estimation proposed in [16] provides a better interpolation quality and in [14, 15] proposed algorithm takes second place. Due to the actual demand of “fake real,” the high level of MC-FRUC is more popular and widely used in many video applications.  3 Proposed Forensics Algorithm  The ﬂow of proposed forensics algorithm is shown in Fig. 4: First, the original video is subjected to MC-FRUC forgery to generate up-converted video, and attacks may also implement on it such as de-noising and compression; then, the Sobel operator is used to extract the edge feature of each video frame; and ﬁnally, analyzing the periodic variation of the edge feature of suspicious video over time to identify whether there is MC-FRUC forgery. The core of the proposed algorithm is the edge feature extraction and periodicity detection, which will be introduced in detail below.   Digital Forensics for Frame Rate Up-Conversion in Wireless Sensor Network  157  Sobel Operator  Original Video  MC-FRUC Forgery  Up-converted  Video  Edge  Extraction  Periodicity Detection  Denoising or Compressing  Fig. 4 Flow of the proposed forensics algorithm  3.1 Edge Feature Extraction  Sobel operator is a discrete differential operator that combines Gaussian smoothing and differential derivation, and it is often used to calculate the approximate gradient of the image [18]. Image edge represents the jump process of pixels, and the gradient is the way to measure the degree of jump. The large gradient value indicates the signiﬁcant improvement of pixel value and reﬂects the distribution of edge features in the image. Let the original video sequence to be composed of L video frames with size M × N. For the t-th frame ft, using the Sobel operator to realize the edge detection in horizontal and vertical direction as follows:  ⎡  ⎣  =  −1 0 +1 −2 0 +2 −1 0 +1  ⎤ ⎦ ∗ f t  gh  ⎡  ⎣  =  −1 −2 −1 0 0 +1 +2 +1  0  ⎤ ⎦ ∗ f t  gv  = % g2 h  + g2  v  gt  σt =  M × N N cid:28  n=1  M cid:28  m=1  gt  m, n    11    12    13    14   where * denotes convolution operation. Geometrical average is calculated pixel by pixel for edge pixel values in horizontal and vertical direction as follows:  where gt is the edge map of ft. Due to the pixel value of video sequences rapidly varying over time, each frame will contain different edge complexities. The edge complexity of gt is measured as follows:   158  W. Ma and R. Li  Fig. 5 Edge complexity curves of the Foreman video sequence of unforged and forged  Note: The unforged video is the original video of 30fps, and the forged video is transferred to 30fps by the method proposed in [15].   From Eq.  14 , if the edge feature occurs greatly in variation in the intra-frame,  the σ t value is smaller; otherwise it is larger.  Due to MC-FRUC algorithm cannot completely reﬂect the motion trajectory between adjacent frames, there always are some motion abnormalities in MC-FRUC forgery. Moreover, there are always some artiﬁcial traces in the forged frames, which have a large impact on detection edge. Therefore, the edge complexity presents periodic mutations in the forged video. As shown in Fig. 5, for Foreman video, using Sobel operator to extract the edge map of unforged and forged video, and then the edge complexity is calculated. It can be seen that the edge complexity curve of unforged video varies steadily and slowly, while the edge complexity curve of forged video rapidly appears in periodic variation. That is why the periodicity of edge complexity curve can be regarded as a strong evidence to detect MC-FRUC forgery.  3.2 Periodicity Detection  By using spectrum analysis to detect the periodicity of edge complexity curve, it can realize the automatic identiﬁcation of MC-FRUC forgery. Fast Fourier transform  FFT  is used to calculate the spectrum Fk of the edge complexity curve σ t as follows:  Fk = FFT  σt   , k = 0, 1,··· , L   15   where FFT    denotes the FFT operator and L is the length of the noise standard curve. High-pass ﬁlter is used to suppress the direct current  DC  and low-frequency   Digital Forensics for Frame Rate Up-Conversion in Wireless Sensor Network  159  Fig. 6 The spectrum of the edge complexity curve for the unforged and the forged video   LF  components of spectrum Fk, as follows:  = HFP  Fk, d  =  F h k   cid:31   d < k ≤ L − d  Fk  0 0 ≤ k ≤ d, L − d < k ≤ L  where HFP    denotes high-pass ﬁlter operator, F h k denotes high-frequency com- ponent, and d is the cutoff frequency. In order to highlight the spectrum peak, amplitude enhancement is performed on F h  k as follows: &&& , k = d + 1,··· , L − d  Sk = L−d cid:18  l=d+1  &&&F h  k  − F h  l  As shown in Fig. 6, after the processing of Eqs.  16  and  17 , the spectrum appears dense and small peaks in the unforged video, while the spectrum center appears a large peak in the forgery video whose amplitude is much higher than the surrounding peak. Thus, the appearance of the large peak proves that the spectrum of edge complexity curve has periodicity. However, it can be seen from Fig. 6b that there are still some small peaks around the large peaks. In order to ﬁlter out small peaks, Sk can be disposed as follows: 1. Initialization: after the maximum value of the spectrum, Sk is retained, and the  0  is assigned, and the iteration variable  remaining components are set to be 0; Pk is set to n = 1.  n−1 .  2. Calculate the mean value E n−1 of Pk 3. Hard threshold shrinkage of Pk  ’   n−1  using E n−1 , as follows: P  n−1   ≥ 0.8E n−1  < 0.8E n−1   P  n−1  P  n−1   k  0  k  k  =  P  n   k   16    17    18    160  4. If it satisﬁes  W. Ma and R. Li  k  k   cid:30   P  n   P  n−1     = ∅  k = 0, 1··· , L  k = 0, 1,··· , L then stop iteration, output Pk= Pk    ∩  cid:30   19   n ; otherwise make n = n+1 go to  2  to continue. As shown in Fig. 7, after the above steps are performed, some small peaks are retained in the unforged video, while only a large peak is retained in the forged video. Therefore, if an abnormal large peak is detected in suspicious video, it can be proved that MC-FRUC forgery operation exists in this video. In order to realize automatic detection, the two spectrum states must be quantiﬁed. Thus, the forgery level value is designed as follows:  FV = MAX{Pk k = 0, 1,··· , L}  J × E 0    20  where MAX{ } represents the maximum value of input set, J represents the peak  0 . As can be seen from Eq. number of Pk, and E 0  represents the mean value of Pk  20 , for the forged video, the peak value of Pk is abnormally large and the number of peaks is extremely few, so its FV value is larger. On the contrary, for the unforged video, the peak value of Pk is smaller and the number of peaks is much more, so its FV value is smaller. Thus, the FV value can be regarded as a quantitative indicator to determine whether there is MC-FRUC forgery, and automatic detection can be achieved by setting appropriate threshold value, that is, on FV ≥ Thr off FV < Thr  MC-FRUC =   21    cid:31   Fig. 7 The spectrum of edge complexity curve after ﬁltering out the small peak interference for the unforged and the forged video   Digital Forensics for Frame Rate Up-Conversion in Wireless Sensor Network  161  where Thr is the decision threshold, on represents the existence of MC-FRUC operation, and off represents the inexistence of MC-FRUC operation.  4 Experimental Results and Analysis  Based on 23 groups of CIF format and 30 fps testing video sequence, the negative set  NS  and positive set  PS  are constructed to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. For the NS, 23 groups of video sequences are directly mixed in Gaussian white noise with standard deviation 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 to form a total of 138 groups of testing video sequences. For the PS, the video sequence of the NS is ﬁrst down-converted to 15 fps, and then the MC-FRUC method proposed in [14–16] is adopted to tamper them to 30 fps to form 552 groups of testing video sequences. Firstly, the proposed algorithm is performed to obtain the distribution of FV values of test videos and to determinate the range of FV value of unforged and forged video. Then, the proposed algorithm is used to detect NS and PS, and its performance is evaluated. Finally, we evaluate the ability of the proposed algorithm to resist the attacks of de-noising and compression. The performance index adopts false-positive rate  FPR  and false-negative rate  FNR , respectively, which are deﬁned as follows:  FPR = RNS NNS  FNR = RPS NPS  DA = 1 − FNR + FPR  2   22    23    24   where RNS and RPS are the number of outliers in NS and PS, respectively and NNS and NPS are the number of test videos in NS and PS, respectively. Moreover, detection accuracy  DA  is deﬁned as follows:  4.1 Performance Analysis  Figure 8 shows the average FV values of NS and PS under different standard deviation values of noise. As can be seen from Fig. 8, the FV values of NS and PS are signiﬁcantly different, so the identiﬁcation of the MC-FRUC can be achieved through hard threshold decision. Figure 9 shows the effects of compression and de-noising attacks on FV values of PS. It can be seen that after the compression and de-noising attacks, the FV value decreases, and it decreases in large amplitude especially for the de-noising attack. The lower the noise variance is, the smaller   162  Fig. 8 Under different standard deviations of noise, the average FV value distribution of the NS and PS  W. Ma and R. Li  Fig. 9 Effects of compression and de-noising attacks on FV value  the FV value is. While the noise variance is larger, the FV value can still guarantee the higher value. Therefore, the proposed forensics algorithm can better resist the attacks of compression and de-noising.  4.2 Detection Results  The threshold Thr is regarded as a critical decision value of the FV value to determine whether there is MC-FRUC forgery in suspicious video, and it is an important parameter to ensure high DA. In order to set the appropriate threshold Thr, the training video sequence of 23 groups of CIF format and 30 fps different from   Digital Forensics for Frame Rate Up-Conversion in Wireless Sensor Network  163  PS NS  y c n e u q e r F  0.35  0.30  0.25  0.20  0.15  0.10  0.05  0.00 0  2  4  6  8  10  12  16  18  20  22  24  26 28  14 FV  Fig. 10 FV distribution of the NS and PS in training video sequence set  the testing video sequence are selected to form a training set of the same capacity as the test set, in which NS and PS are still constructed by the above method. Figure 10 shows the probability distribution of the FV value of NS and PS in the training set. We can observe that the FV values of mostly NS samples are less than 3. While the distribution of FV values of the PS samples is more uniform and about 90%, the FV values of PS samples are greater than 3. Therefore, a more appropriate threshold Thr should be less than 3. Based on the above analysis results, we select several candidate thresholds in the range of [0.05, 3] with a step size of 0.05 and select the most appropriate threshold among them by cross-validation. First, the NS and PS of the training set are randomly divided into two subsets of the same capacity and nonoverlapping, respectively, one of which is used for training and the other for testing. For the training subset, all candidate thresholds are adopted to detect all samples so as to select threshold of the highest average DA. For the testing subset, the optimal threshold of training subset output is adopted to calculate the average DA of the testing subset. The above cross-validation scheme is executed 10 times, and the variations of threshold and average DA are shown in Fig. 11. It can be observed that the selected optimal threshold can ensure the average DA of test subset above 0.92 in each cross-validation, and the average DA reaches the maximum value when the threshold Thr is 2.4. Based on the cross-validation results, it is more appropriate to set the threshold Thr to be 2.4.  Table 1 shows the average DA of video sequences generated by different MCFI forgery methods. It can be seen from Table 1 that when the suspicious video is not subject to post-processing attack, the average DA reaches 100% under any standard deviation α of noise. This demonstrates that the detection edge complexity is an effective method to identify MC-FRUC forgery. After compression attack is performed on the test video in PS, the detection occur error under the condition of no noise. For example, for the forgery method in [14], the FNR value is 0.16,   164  W.

However, the average DA recovers to 100% when active noise is implemented, which indicates that the edge complexity can resist the adverse impact of compression attack on the detection for the noisy video. The Gaussian noise is effectively suppressed after the de-noising attack is implemented, which has a certain impact on the proposed algorithm taking the detection edge complexity as the core. In the case of no noise, the FNR value is up to 0.17, and the average DA is only 0.915. The average DA is improved after the noise mixed in, which indicates that the edge complexity can resist de-noising attack to a certain extent for the noisy video.   Digital Forensics for Frame Rate Up-Conversion in Wireless Sensor Network  165  5 Conclusions  This chapter proposes a forensics algorithm that can identify MC-FRUC forgery by quantifying the variation of edge features in video frames. The proposed algorithm ﬁrst using the Sobel operator to detect edges of video frame and then the edges is quantiﬁed to obtain the edge complexity of each frame. Finally, the periodicity of the edge complexity along time axis is detected, and MC-FRUC forgery is automatically identiﬁed by hard threshold decision. Experimental results show that the FV values of unforged videos are much lower than those of forged videos. When the decision threshold is set to be 2.4, the proposed algorithm shows a good detection performance on the NS composed of 138 video sequences and the PS composed of 532 video sequences. When the post-processing attack is not performed on testing videos, the average DA reaches 100%. The proposed algorithm can still maintain the stability of the detection accuracy after the attacks of de- noising and compression.  References  1. Choudhury, S., Al-Turjman, F., & Pino, T.  2018 .

Ak  1 Introduction  The Internet of Things  IoT  is deﬁned as a unique network around the world, where uniquely addressable objects are formed and the objects in that network communicate with each other through a speciﬁc protocol. It is also possible to deﬁne this concept as a system of devices that communicate and communicate with each other through a variety of communication protocols and by sharing information with an intelligent network [1]. Since safety is one of the most important and prone concepts for occupational safety and health in mining, proactive-based IoT applications supported risk analysis can be adapted to the system in mining sector [2]. IoT sensors and devices can be used to improve total safety level [3]. Investigation of proper way with wireless sensor network features is done to monitor outdoor environment [4]. According to wireless network ability, changing environment conditions can be explored and adopted [5]. The system can help to minimize hazards and environmental problems such as water pollution and ﬁres. Environmental monitoring with IoT can also provide cost-efﬁcient and proper solutions [6].  Risk analysis of any workplace is ﬁrst step to check and observe total safety level. There are many quantitative and qualitative risk assessment tools to analyze reasons of accidents in various industries and features of the workplace conditions in sources. Multi-criteria decision-making-based method is one of the most important methods [4]. In these methods, decision-makers often have difﬁculty in accurate rating and assessment in a danger related with risk parameter. Therefore, imple- menting potential risk assessment methods can show satisfactory results in terms  M. F.

Ak  of incomplete risk data or high uncertainty. In this study the ways that combine multi-criteria decision-making method and fuzzy sets are accepted to model the structure [5]. One of the important advantages of fuzzy multi-criteria decision- making methods is relatively assessing the risk parameters by using fuzzy numbers instead of insigniﬁcant numbers [6]. Chart 1 shows a comparative summary about a range of new researches related with fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methods in occupational health and safety risk assessment [7–15].  In the underground mining, the work environment becomes more appropriate with the OHS, and the occupational accidents and occupational diseases are affected positively by taking necessary precautions, by the worker’s feelings of trust originating from the work environment. In addition, these factors become the reasons for the improvements that cause positive effects as in the employee’s daily life as his efﬁciency in workplace [16]. This is also important in the aspect of improvement and continuity of the system in a similar way.  From this point of view, potential risks in mines within occupational health and safety and forming OHS risk analysis scheme and managing the necessary precautions actively by classifying emerging dangers are aimed in this study in the process of carrying out the underground mining. To improve the system precautions which are taken necessarily in accordance with detailed risk analysis.  As a part of this study, the risk assessment study based on fuzzy and neuro-fuzzy logic is carried out by using the data based on OHS risk analysis of a metal mine industry which has more than one billion production capacity and is compared to failure level of the basic risk assessment methods.  1.1 Original Contribution  Based on the data that is obtained within the study, by using neuro-fuzzy logic approach in underground mining, risk analysis is done and risk levels are estimated. Underground mining risk parameters in OHS assessing by neuro-fuzzy logic are used for the ﬁrst time, and the results are compared with the results of basic risk assessment methods in the point-of-failure criterion.  Besides that, L-matrix risk assessment results and two-phase risk analysis results [17] obtained by Buckley fuzzy analytic hierarchy method and fuzzy VlseKriter- ijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje  VIKOR  methods are compared with neuro-fuzzy logic obtained by the results from risk assessments by considering the failure measures in OHS; in terms of implementing more detailed studies, the sources in this area have been enriched.

Ak  protecting and improving employee’s health;  2  improving and supporting healthy and safe work, workplace, and work organizations;  3  increasing employees’ physical, mental, and social welfare; and  4  enabling the workers having fruitful lives both socially and ﬁnancially [18, 19].  1.2 Occupational Health and Safety  OHS is all the studies and analyses that aim reducing the problems which may occur in all processes related with work and employees. In terms of OHS, structural difﬁculty of the underground mining services and precision as of divergent and rapidly changing equipment structure need to be done detailed research and analysis [20]. In workplaces employees work that are of the most important parts of underground mining services, being with unreliable factors in the aspect of OHS and lack of precautions for these factors are required to create different regulations. The underground mining organizations are part of the most dangerous group in terms of occupational accidents and occupational diseases in OHS risk classiﬁcation list, and this makes compulsory to conduct detailed and effective risk analysis of underground mining services.  Making workplaces appropriate for OHS in underground mining, identifying the occupational accidents and occupational diseases, taking necessary precautions, and making employees feel safe due to working environment affect their works positively [21]. In addition these factors become the reasons for the improvements that cause positive effects as in the employee’s daily life as his efﬁciency in workplace. This is also important in the aspect of improvement and continuity of the system in a similar way.  Based on these results, potential risks in mine organizations within occupational health and safety and forming detailed OHS risk analysis scheme and managing the necessary precautions actively are aimed in this study in the process of carrying out the underground mining. To improve the system precautions which are taken necessarily in accordance with risk analysis, results are stated.  1.3 Occupational Health and Relevant Terms  There are many deﬁnitions of the health term in different sources. WHO which does practices on health internationally deﬁnes the health as “not only health” or disablement situation, but also, it’s a person’s wellbeing and feeling completely in safe physically, mentally, and socially [22]. This deﬁnition may change depending on country, culture, and customs. Criteria of a person being healthy cannot be explained by having physical disability or catching a disease. Besides physical aspects, being safe mentally and socially are the other criteria that make a person healthy. From this point of view, health term is the basis of occupational health   A Neuro-fuzzy-Based Multi-criteria Risk Evaluation Approach: A Case Study. . .  171  [23]. During the employee’s process of being at work or workplace, not being exposed to the risks that will threaten his health and being protected from this are the occupational health term’s basic relation with health. Protecting from the dangers due to the employees’ working environment and job structure is the essential point in the deﬁnition of the occupational health term.  Occupational health is a term that searches the physical and mental situation of the employees in workplaces and aims to improve the conditions. In the aspect of occupational health, it is the most important term not to risk and protect the right to life which is among an individual’s natural and fundamental rights, causing from the workplace [24]. Besides that, it also is a compulsory part of the occupational health system to have high efﬁciency, increase quality standards, and create a sustainable working environment. Comprehending this term as a social culture rather than understanding it as a term just related with workplaces is signiﬁcant not only in the aspect of employer-employee interaction, but also it is important for developing healthy and safe environment by all society ranks [25]. There are many national and international scale regulations with the aim of increasing the OHS culture. An individual’s work department is also substantial in accordance with explanations of the occupational health term. In terms of OHS, while doing the work that employee is in charge of, he needs to be conscious and knowledgeable, and to be able to do that, person’s nature and kind of the job needs to adjust in maximum possibility [26]. It is necessary that employees work in appropriate jobs which are suitable with their education level and physical and mental state with regard to actualizing the aims of the occupational health term. If a person works in a suitable job in that sense, opportunities of protecting from the risks will increase, and the number of the occupational accidents and its effects will be able to decrease in parallel with this.  1.4 Occupational Safety and Relevant Terms  Safety term expresses being secure. Occupational safety states that taking precautions against the risks that employees can face. Among the process of employees being at work or workplace, the unrepairable consequences that may occur because of occupational accidents show the importance of creating a safety culture term [27]. This must be changeable according to the business and job structure, but it should be aimed at spreading it to a whole society, as well. For instance, it must be aimed that while dealing with workers who are having health problems, whether work process is safe or not for underground mining sector which is considered as an important situation in this study. A worker who is not feeling safe in the working environment makes mistakes, and troubles occur in the job unavoidably [28]. Safety culture should be provided with employee- employer cooperation, and drafts, plans, and programs that serve this should be prepared periodically. It is not possible that being successful in a safe environment is constituted by only an employee or employer. Systematically, all the pieces should have effects on it and contribute to form the safety culture [29, 30].   172  M. F. Ak  Many occupational accidents occur every year all around the world due to the deﬁciencies in the implementation of OHS. According to the International Labor Organization data, more than one billion people die every year because of occupational accidents, and more people are physically or mentally hurt due to these accidents [31]. These data show how the OHS issue is signiﬁcant. Based on the statistical data which is brought out by social security institution, recently, the people who die because of occupational accidents and occupational diseases have been increasing, and for this reason, it has been observed that the people who become permanently disabled are increasing, too [32]. Fatal occupational accidents increased more than 10%, when it is compared to the previous year, and in parallel with this, being permanently disabled and occupational diseases highly increased in 2014. In that case, according to statistical studies done for underground mining, currently, Turkey is rather behind the world in terms of the number of the occupational accidents in developed countries, number of the people who is permanently disabled, and number of the occupational disease rates. By taking all these into consideration, legislature regulated the laws and passed the 6331 numbered law under the title of OHS. Before passing a law special for OHS, there were legal analyses related with occupational accidents and occupational diseases by different regulations. For example, there were analyses under separate and different laws for the pecuniary and nonpecuniary damages that occur after an occupational accident. This can be resulted with faults, and it may not be possible to get positive results. Besides that, a legal obligation that includes OHS regulations and adapts it emerged in point of the European Union  EU  adaptation process and ILO directives. OHS term is suitable for chances and needy for improvement according to gathered statistical occupational accident and occupational disease data in Turkey in recent years. OHS policies are changed, and current laws are shaped in accordance with EU and ILO directives [33]. Before the legalization, OHS terms that are emphasized on the speciﬁc parts of the different laws are combined in one title.  Following the explanations of the health and safety concepts that generate the OHS concept, the differences between these two concepts have been revealed. Occupational health refers to search for developing and improving their physical and mental status, as occupational safety at work or in the workplace is the protection of employees from risks and the risks they face in the workplace. The fact that employees are in a healthy and safe environment is the main objective of these two concepts [34]. A healthy environment in terms of OHS increases the productivity of employees and the ability to work in a safe environment. Proper physical, psychological, and social workplace environment to be provided for employees is a proactive structure and is the priority of identifying and minimizing risks in advance. It should not be forgotten that the budget for the precautions to be taken by proactive approach to work accidents is much more appropriate and necessary than the damages that will happen as the result of occupational accident.   A Neuro-fuzzy-Based Multi-criteria Risk Evaluation Approach: A Case Study. . .  173  1.5 Management Concept in OHS  It is compulsory to have a managerial understanding in the system in terms of OHS structure. It would be normal to occur and growing problems in terms of occupational safety and occupational health in a business that the management is not being part of and support OHS implementation and activities. Studies on OHS indicate that the lack of a management-supported system is one of the most impor- tant reasons for the increase in job accidents. This demonstrates the importance of management understanding in the success of OHS practices. The implementation of a well-designed and experienced OHS management model means that employees are aware of the hazards and the risks are minimized; all employees are in a safe and healthy environment as a team. In addition, the productivity of employees and work will also improve. In this context, the employer must make investments for the occupational area of the OHS without any legal obligations on occupational health and safety and should not regard this as an unnecessary cost. Protecting from danger is much less costly than protection from possible consequences. It should also be kept in mind that when an appropriate environment for OHS is created, it is possible to achieve a sustainable success by reducing the number of mistakes relatively.  In places where work will be done, the target risks should be determined in advance in terms of OHS management, and occupational accidents and occupational diseases should be prevented [35]. These undesirable consequences may cause workforce and ﬁnancial loss in the workplace. This workplace-based problem may cause social trauma without staying local. Soma disaster that happened on 13 May 2014 is an example of this. The human loss was far beyond ﬁnancial loss, and it is clear that it is not an easy situation to overcome this trauma. As it is frequently written at workplaces and working points, a safe working environment must be created in actual implementation and management decisions. Management should inform and provide periodical trainings on OHS issues to employees. In addition, each division-speciﬁc OHS chargehand should be identiﬁed and known by all employees. An OHS plan which is prepared by the management should also be periodically checked and updated. A safe and healthy workplace means healthy and efﬁcient work and ultimately healthy functioning. Each part of the OHS management practices should include risk assessment and practices, and teamwork should be adopted.  2 Risk Assessment in OHS  Concepts of safety, health, and welfare of whole industries’ employees in the workplace are covered by OHS [36]. Due to the poor management of OHS, the underground mining sector that is one of the most affected industries aims to raise the health and safety standards in the relevant institutions in Turkey and all around the world. Many unique hazards can be observed in mines that can potentially   174  M. F. Ak  affect the health of workers in their departments [37]. These risks increase the accidents in the workplace, affect both the safety of employees and the environment antagonistically, and reduce the efﬁciency and work performance. OHS practices are not fully implemented in practice, and necessary diligence has not been shown for the underground mining industry in Turkey. There is a negative correlation in economic success and occupational success in Turkey although there should be a positive correlation between OHS practices and economic success. In order to be able to see the OHS policy and compliance in the mining sector more clearly, the new OHS 6331 numbered law also stipulates the necessity of risk assessment. As a result of this reason, this study aims to provide a neuro-fuzzy logic-based OHS risk evaluation for underground mining personnel and to contribute to the development and planning of underground mining services.  On the other hand, OHS risk assessment has several approaches in the planning and management of the underground mining industry. In a literature study, the VIKOR method has been proposed to prioritize failure modes for a fuzzy FMEA based on fuzzy set theory and for general anesthesia process risk assessment [38]. One of the most common risk analysis methods is FMEA which has three parameters. In this study parameters of the FMEA are weighted by fuzzy set theory, and the risk priorities of error modes are determined by the extended VIKOR method. In another study [39] a new FMEA approach was implemented with the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process  FAHP , entropy, and fuzzy VIKOR methods in the production process of a mine. In one other study [40], a three-stage risk-based prioritization scheme is suggested to select the best care strategy for prioritizing medical devices. First, the fuzzy FMEA was implemented by taking into account various risk assessment factors. Second, seven dimensions are used to consider every aspect of hazards and risks, such as use-related hazards, age, and usage. Finally, a simple method has been used to determine the best maintenance strategy for each device based on the scores of the previous two steps. A new risk priority model has been proposed to assess the risk of failure modes based on the fuzzy set theory and the MULTIMOORA method [41]. Besides, a case study on preventing baby abduction was also presented.  Based on the studies in the literature, it is understood that the current study has contributed to the relevant resources on some aspects of underground mining risk assessment.  A fuzzy logic-based structure that removes the shortcomings of a clear risk parameter calculation and reduces the inconvenient has been used to make decisions. Unlike classical OHS risk assessment methods, decision-makers choose param- eter weights with a neuro-fuzzy tongue scale. Decision makers can get beneﬁt from neuro-fuzzy logic while establishing appropriate structure of risk assessment process neuro. Classical OHS risk assessment methods consist of either two risk parameters  e.g., decision matrix method  or three risk parameters  e.g., Fine- Kinney method, FMEA method . Increasing the number of parameters in the study will provide a more ﬂexible usage, and a consistent and broad risk assessment model will be presented. This study is the ﬁrst risk assessment study in the country   A Neuro-fuzzy-Based Multi-criteria Risk Evaluation Approach: A Case Study. . .  175  where the neuro-fuzzy logic approach in occupational health and safety is applied in underground mining.  2.1 OHS Studies in Underground Mining and Current Status  the associations related to Developing the standards of health and safety at underground mining is aimed. Mines which are one of the largest employment groups in the manufacturing sector are facing serious hazards due to the risks which are technically deﬁned previously. These risk factors are increasing the number of occupational accidents, affecting the safety of both the employees and the nature, decreasing the productivity and work performance. Although Turkey has been making signiﬁcant progress in economic ﬁeld and making relatively rapid growth in its own geography, OHS implementations are not carried out in a complete and active way, and adequate care has not been shown in underground mining industry. Hence, the aim of the study is to assess the risks for underground mining staff, contribute to process planning in mining, and develop the regulations. There should be an OHS policy which is approved and carried out by the executives of all the enterprises, planned periodically, and open to development and updates [42].  Planning is the ﬁrst stage of OHS policy. Within the frame of this plan, all the hazards should be deﬁned in terms of facility structure and workplaces, and the staff should be informed about this. Responsible staff should be designated for special OHS security in each department; permanent and sustainable success should be aimed. In addition to this, convenient regulations should be prepared in accordance with the facility’s structure in the medium-sized and large-scale enterprises, and template plans should be created [43].  In order to make staff learn about these regulations, trainings and seminars should be organized and tested periodically. By OHS policy, control mechanism matters. As a result of the control understanding which has gained more importance in underground mining, it has been playing a signiﬁcant role in precluding the occupational accidents which could result in death. When researching the Ministry of Labor and Social Security  MOLSS ’s short-term and medium-term policies, it is stated that the main aim is to establish a data archive regarding OHS and assess these data on periodical basis [44]. As a result of these studies which will be done on sectoral basis, there will arise a better opportunity to ﬁght against the occupational accidents and illnesses.  As exempliﬁed in the second part, Turkey needs more active policies and follow- ups in order to move to higher positions from where it is currently in OHS ﬁeld. In the studies done, it is seen that there are risks in underground ﬁeld, inadequacy, and malfunctions in diagnosing occupational illnesses. The top reason underlying this inadequacy is that OHS training is not in the required position that it should be. In the facilities which carry top level of risk in hazard classiﬁcations such as underground mining, the number of training sessions should be increased and   176  M. F. Ak  conceptualized as project. In underground mining risk assessment study, it was found that the participation and interest of the employees in trainings and researches were low. It is obvious that Turkey needs achievements in OHS policies to reach at the position aimed within the scope of Vision 2023. At this point, it would be rightful to invest in R & D works on both state and private sector basis. In order to form OHS policy as a culture, both enterprises and employees are needed to be encouraged to participate in the cooperation.  Like it happens in all the businesses, the management system is the key to reach the success in a workplace. At the same point, OHS management implementations are required to be prepared in an organizational way and be efﬁcient in all businesses. In order to carry out the responsibilities of OHS in an efﬁcient and successful way, management support is mandatory. These are also valid and critical for the underground mining-based OHS management system [20]. Feeling safe and being healthy for the staff working in underground mining services will lead to receive better results in studies. As the nature of the job, mining workers face many hazardous situations every day, and they try to avoid these situations as much as possible. Individually, it is not possible to keep away from the hazards in underground mining sector. Hence, establishing OHS management and control system efﬁciently will lead to success at the workplace and get protected against the hazards in a more efﬁcient way.  2.2 Risk Assessment in Multi-criteria Decision-Making  Methods  Risk assessment involves the data of the risk-generating elements being ﬁnalized by calculating and the analysis of their possibilities. The risk analysis, which is basically divided into two as qualitatively and quantitatively, can be actualized more efﬁciently by expressing more criteria than one of the complex systems thanks to the multi-criteria decision-making methods. These methods enable the decision-makers to get decision results as easily, quickly, and efﬁciently as possible, in case that there are multiple alternatives and multiple parameters.  2.2.1  5×5 Matrix Risk Assessment Methodology  Risk assessment is an approach, widely used in OHS risk analysis, which measures the 5×5 matrix method risk classiﬁcation, also known as the decision matrix technique, based on the decision that reviews it within the dimension of both severity and probability parameters. With this method, by multiplying severity and probability, a risk value criterion is obtained.  Initially, the measurement of severity and probability is determined by this method  Charts 2 and 3 . Afterward, risk matrix and decision-making table are   A Neuro-fuzzy-Based Multi-criteria Risk Evaluation Approach: A Case Study. . .  177  Chart 2 Probability gradation chart [18]  Probability  probability value  Gradation steps for likelihood of appearance Very low  1  Low  2  Medium  3  High  4  Very high  5   Almost never Very rare  once a year , only under abnormal conditions Rare  a few times a year  Often  once a month  Very often  once a week, every day , under normal working conditions  Chart 3 Severity gradation chart [18]  Severity  severity value  Very mild  1  Mild  2   Moderate  3  Severe  4  Very severe  5   Gradation No loss of working hours, can be eliminated, requires ﬁrst aid No loss of working day, ambulatory treatment without lasting consequences Mild bodily harm, inpatient treatment injury Severe injury, long-term treatment, occupational illness Death, permanent total disablement  Chart 4 Risk score evaluation matrix [18]  Risk score Probability 1  Very Low  2  Low  3  Medium  4  High  5  Very high   Severity 1  Very mild  Insigniﬁcant 1 Low 2 Low 3 Low 4 Low 5  3  Moderate  2  Mild  Low 3 Low 2 Low 6 Low 4 Low 6 Medium 9 Medium 8 Medium 12 Medium 10 High 15  5  Very severe  Low 5  4  Severe  Low 4 Medium 8 Medium 10 Medium 12 High 15 High 16 High 20 Intolerable High 20  In the study, a fuzzy approach was proposed that allows experts to evaluate two  created  Charts 4 and 5 .

Since the conventional 5×5 matrix method is based on the weight of an equal measure for the severity and probability, it can cause limitations and inconsistencies.  3 Fuzzy Logic and ANFIS  In 1940s, neurophysiology expert Warren McCulloch and mathematician Walter Pitts conducted a research on how the neuros might work.

If it is not possible to lower the risks even though precautions are taken, then the action should be prevented Work shouldn’t be started until the identiﬁed risk can be reduced; if there is a continuing action, it should be stopped immediately. If the risk is about the continuation of work, then urgent measures should be taken, and as a result of these measures, the continuation of the activity should be decided Activities should be initiated to reduce the identiﬁed risks. Risk mitigation measures can take time Additional control processes might not be needed to reduce the identiﬁed risks. However, existing controls should be continued, and they should be supervised It might not be necessary to plan control processes and keep the records of the actions to be done, to dispose the identiﬁed risks  by using electric circuits, to describe how the neurons in the brain work. In 1950s, with the advances in computers, it became possible to simulate the hypothetical neural networks. However ﬁrst studies resulted unsuccessfully. In the 1960s, the models named “ADALINE” and “MADALINE” were developed. ADALINE was developed with the aim of recognizing binary patterns, while MADALINE was applied ﬁrstly on neural network to a real-world problem. It is used ﬁrstly on an adaptive ﬁlter which supplies opportunity to eliminate echoes on phone lines. The model is still in use commercially. After 1970, development of artiﬁcial neural network  ANN  accelerated and brought solutions to important problems. The development of correlation matrix memory and multilayer perceptron were some of the developments after 1970. Today, neural networks are used in many areas. The fundamental idea of the neural networks is that, if it works in nature, it should work on computers as well. ANN has a strong nonlinear mapping ability, strong learning ability, and a high sensitivity level. An artiﬁcial neural network is a classiﬁer modeled after the human brain. The human brain has billions of nerve cells  approximately ten billion . They form a complex and developed signal transmission network system by connecting to homogeneous cells. Cell gathers the input from all the connection points until it reaches to a certain level. After the input reaches this level, the cell sends a signal to all the cells it is connected to in the network. ANN is expected to imitate the human brain, and its working is the same as the biological neuron structure in the human brain. However, the working of ANN is based on mathematical evidence. Some neural network structures are not close to the brain in location, and some doesn’t have a biological counterpart in the brain. At the same time, neural networks have a very strong resemblance to the biological brain, and therefore neuroscience terminology is used frequently. ANN learns the relationship between the selected input and the output. Neuros are connected to each other to help this process. Each neuron processes the input taken from one   A Neuro-fuzzy-Based Multi-criteria Risk Evaluation Approach: A Case Study. . .  179  Fig. 1 Basis of an artiﬁcial neuron  neuron k  sk  Σ  F  +1  ya  yb  Wk0 Wka  Wkb  Linear Function  Step Function  yk  s  s  y  0  y  0  y  0  y  0  s  s  Log Sigmoid Function  Tangent Sigmoid Function  or more neurons and produces output. The ANN structure is considered to be a versatile framework in which learning progresses by taking into account external or internal data passing through the system. ANN can take a few weighted inputs and summarize them, and if the combined inputs exceed a threshold, they will activate and send an output. Activation process determines which output to send, and the output is usually between 0 and 1  or −1 and 1 . Since the derivatives of the activation function are often used in network training, a few additional calculations are needed so that the derivative can be expressed by the original function value.  Although the artiﬁcial neural network is simulated from the biological model, its  base unit has a simpler structure. Figure 1 shows the basis of an artiﬁcial neuron. ya and yb input wks represent the connection weight of each input. w0 is the transfer function with a value of +1 to every neuron. This function is used as a transfer function between the input layer and the hidden layer in the system. It regulates the system output with interval [−1 1]. In the next step, mathematical calculations are conducted, majority of addition and the products of process are fed through nonlinear transmission functions to produce output. The structure of all the artiﬁcial neural network is the same, but they may differ at some points.  The most common transfer functions were shown in Fig. 1. Depending on the application, transfer functions may vary. The linear function can be selected to solve linear problems, and the result from the summation function is multiplied by a certain coefﬁcient and calculated as output. This can be expressed as y = c.s, where the c value is invariant. Threshold function gets the value of 1 or −1. At this point, value is determined according to the set threshold level.  This can be shown as:  y = {1 if s ≥ 0, y = −1 if s < 0}   1    180  M. F. Ak  The sigmoid activation function is a continuous function that can be derived. While using sigmoid activation function, artiﬁcial neuron may seem like a natural neuron. This function produces output between 0 and 1.  Tangent sigmoid function is a function which is similar to sigmoid function. The difference is the point at which the output values change [−1 to 1] by giving a negative output.  y = 1    cid:6   1 + e −s   cid:7   y =  cid:6    cid:7   −s   cid:6   es + e −s   cid:7      es–e   2    3   While artiﬁcial neural nets are but artiﬁcial interconnections of neurons, they can learn the relationships between the inputs and outputs selected from previous experience. ANNs can also fulﬁll their task as parallel processing. This gives an advantage in terms of speed. A typical ANN can describe and learn the relationships between the input and the output of a nonlinear multidimensional system. ANN and the structure of multidimensional nonlinear system are shown in Figs. 2 and 3.  The main problem with the single-layered network is that they cannot classify the nonlinear functions. The complexity of the single-layered neurons isn’t large enough to address bigger classiﬁcation problems. The logical depth of such problems is too great for an only perceptron to overcome. To overcome this problem, a few layered networks should be formed. These are called multilayer perceptron. The structure of the multilayer perceptron is shown in Fig. 4.  xi represents the input, wij represents the weight, yk represents the output, and F  represents the transfer function.  ANNs are superior to the conventional algorithms in terms of processing style and speed, storage structure and network prevalence, learning ability, offering error tolerance level, making use of experience, and ﬂexibility of rule-setting.

Human brain can interpret and process the incorrect and incomplete sensor information received from the organs. Similarly, fuzzy set theory can provide a systematic approach which deals with this information from a linguistic perspective. In addition, it can also make numerical calculations by using the membership function for the speciﬁed linguistic labels. The structure of fuzzy inference system  FIS  is based on fuzzy logic, fuzzy set theory, and fuzzy if-then rules. Framing of fuzzy if-then rules forms the key component of FIS. It is a very commonly used technique, and it is commonly applied in different ﬁelds such as system identiﬁcation, automatic control, expert system, decision-making, model classiﬁcation robotics, time series analysis, and forecasting. A fuzzy logic system consists of three basic components. These are a rule base, a data base, and a logic mechanism. Rule base consists of selected fuzzy rules, while a data base deﬁnes the membership functions of fuzzy rules. Fuzzy logic inference is modeled according to the rules to obtain a reasonable output or   182  M. F. Ak  result. Jang introduced the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system  ANFIS  by placing FIS within framework of customizable network. ANFIS is a neural fuzzy technique which is called adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system. ANFIS is also a neural fuzzy method in which the fusion process is carried out between the artiﬁcial neural network and fuzzy inference system. Its structure consists of a set of knots which are connected via adaptive network-oriented connections. The output of these adaptive knots depends on variable parameters related to these knots. Learning rule targets to minimize errors with update on these parameters. ANFIS methodology consists of a hybrid system which combines fuzzy logic and artiﬁcial neural network technique. While providing the artiﬁcial neural network with adaptation logic, fuzzy logic also considers the instability and ambiguity of the modeled system. By using this hybrid technique, together with the input variables, an initial fuzzy model structure is produced with the help of the rules gathered from the input and output data of the system. Afterward, neural network is used to produce the latest ANFIS model of the system and to regulate the rules of the ﬁrst fuzzy model [45, 29].  3.1.1 ANFIS Structure  Basically, it is assumed that fuzzy inference system consists of two inputs and one output. The rule base includes the fuzzy if-then rules of Takagi and Sugeno. That is,  If x is A, y is B then z is a funtion related to them z = f  x, y  .  At this point x and y are the input variables, A and B are the fuzzy sets, and z is  the output variable.  Generally, f  x,y  is a polynomial for the x and y variables. But, there could also be a function serving any other purpose that is able to roughly describe the input of the system within this fuzzy section. If f  x,y  has a ﬁxed value, this forms the zero- degree Sugeno fuzzy model. This can be regarded as a special case of the Mamdani fuzzy inference system, in which each rule is indicated by a fuzzy uniqueness. If f x,y  is a ﬁrst-degree polynomial, this forms the ﬁrst-degree Sugeno fuzzy model. Two rules for the ﬁrst-degree Sugeno fuzzy inference system can be stated in this way:  Rule 1 : If x is A1 and y is B1, then f 1 = p1x + q1y + r1  Rule 2 : If x is A2 and y is B2, then f 2 = p2x + q2y + r2  ANFIS structure is shown schematically in Fig. 7. Figure 7 ANFIS structure in layered representation Layers of ANFIS structure are described as follows: Layer 1: Every knot in this layer is square and adaptive.   A Neuro-fuzzy-Based Multi-criteria Risk Evaluation Approach: A Case Study. . .  = μAi  x   O1 i  X is the input related to i knot. Ai is the linguistic variable related to knot function. μAi x  is the membership function of Ai. μAi x  can be chosen in two different  ways. The ﬁrst one is calculated in this way:  The second one is calculated in this way:  μAi  x  =   cid:8  cid:4   1 x−ci  ai  1 +   cid:9  bi   cid:5 2  μAi  x  = exp  ’  cid:11  −  x − ci      cid:12 2  ai  At this point x is input. ai, bi, and ci are precursor parameter sets. Layer 2: Every knot in this layer is a ﬁxed knot which calculates ﬁring strength wi of a rule. The output of each knot is a product of all the signals it receives, and this is shown as follows:  = wi = μAi  x  × μBi  y , i = 1, 2  O2 i  Layer 3: Each knot in this layer has a ﬁxed structure. Each i. knot calculates the ratio of the ﬁring strength of i. rule to the combined ﬁring powers of all the rules. i. output of i. knot shows the normalized ﬁring level as shown below:  = wi =  O3 i  , i = 1, 2  wi  w1 + w2  Layer 4: Each knot in this layer is an adaptive knot which has a knot function as  shown below:  sets.  = wi fi = wi  pi x + qi y + ri   , i = 1, 2  O4 i  At this point wi is the output of layer 3. pi, qi, and ri are the outcome parameter  Layer 5: This layer calculates the total output as a ﬁxed knot which calculates it  as the total of the signals coming from all the inputs.  =  cid:18   ωi fi =  O5 i  i   cid:28  i ωi fi cid:28  i ωi  183   4    5    6    7    8    9    10    184  M. F. Ak  Considering the precursor parameter value, ANFIS structure can be expressed as  linear combination of the resulting output parameters obtained as a result.  f1 + w2 f = w1 w1+w2 w1+w2 = w1f1 + w2f2  f2  =  w1x  p1 +  w1y  q1 +  w1  r1 +  w1x  p2 +  w2y  q2 +  ww  r2   11   Here, f has a linear structure in pi, qi, and ri parameters. This structure represents the learning algorithm of ANFIS. In the forward transition of the learning algorithm, the result parameters are deﬁned by estimating the smallest squares, while in the backward transition, error signals spread out from the output layer to the input layer. In this backward transition, gradient descent algorithm is used to update the precursor parameters.  3.2 OHS Risk Assessment in Underground Mining: A Case  Study Using Multi-criteria Fuzzy Logic Approach  The mine management tries to identify some of the most important hazards in the production process in order to take the necessary precautions and to prevent the incidence of occupational accidents. A team that consists of ten decision-makers  DM1–DM7  was set up to assess the types of hazards in ﬁve sections of the mine and the entire system. Decision-makers consist of seven mining engineers. Five types of major, totally 75 hazards are deﬁned by the DM team as  H1–H75 . Risk parameters are created as “possibility, severity, and sensitivity to nonuse of personal protective equipment and non-maintenance sensitivity and unpredictability” with the help of the relevant literature review and the views of the DM team  Chart 6 .  Linguistic variables which are used by seven decision-makers are shown in Chart 7 in order to evaluate the subjective signiﬁcance of the risk parameters. Linguistic rating of variables is shown in Chart 7 to assess the grading of hazard types according to each risk  Chart 8 .  The Buckley FAHP method, expert’s assessment of linguistic variables, was used to calculate the subjective weights of the risk parameters through bilateral comparisons, and the results are given in Chart 9. The consistency rate calculated in this study was found to be less than 0.1 according to decision-makers’ calculations. Furthermore, the binary comparison matrix can be considered appropriate, and the questionnaire is valid in terms of FAHP  Fig. 5 .

In the study, the risk parameter evaluations of experts’ linguistic variables were evaluated in total for all employees  i.e., “whole system” and “whole system evaluations of 75 different hazard types” have been carried out . Then, the resulting linguistic evaluations are transformed into triangular fuzzy numbers. Afterward, the cumulative fuzzy ratings of the hazard types are obtained to determine the fuzzy decision matrix. The fuzzy decision matrix for the mining workplace is given in Chart 10.  After all, the fuzzy best fj* and fuzzy worst fj- values of all risk parameter estimates are calculated using Eqs.  8  and  9 . Normalized fuzzy distance is calculated for each risk parameter of the hazard types in the workplace. Afterward, the values of R, S, and Q have been calculated for all hazard types as in Chart 10. Finally, the risk precedence order of the danger types is determined according to S, R, and Q in decreasing order. While the minimum values have the highest risk rankings, the risks closest to 1 in S, R, and Q values represent the lowest risk.  From the obtained results, it can be understood that three most important hazard types in the observed mine are  H63 ,  H65 , and  H13  orderly. The hazard types of  H57 ,  H58 ,  H63 , and  H65  have been placed in the ﬁrst rows in the observed mine on the ventilation system category. There is a total of ﬁve clusters as shown in Chart 11. Cluster 1 consists of ﬁve different hazard types;  H2  represents the hazard with the highest level of risk. Cluster 2 is composed of 7 different hazard types, Cluster 3 is composed 21 different hazard types, Cluster 4 is composed of 12 different hazard types, and ﬁnally Cluster 5 is composed of 31 different hazards.  4 Implementation  In this study, ANFIS-oriented model is implemented which will deal with under- ground mining risk analysis problem in three stages on the basis of neuro-fuzzy approach. Using the data gathered from a mine in Turkey which has over 1000   A Neuro-fuzzy-Based Multi-criteria Risk Evaluation Approach: A Case Study. . .  187  Fig. 6 Neuro-fuzzy logic and risk assessment model stages of OHS  workers with a capacity of over one million tones, risk assessment study was carried out based on neuro-fuzzy logic, and the comparison was made via classic risk assessment methods over error criterion.  In Fig. 6 the stages of the study carried out using neuro-fuzzy logic approach are given. In order to show the implemented method’s productivity and ﬂexibility, the obtained results will be compared via Buckley FAHP and FVIKOR two-stage risk assessment models.  Within Buckley FAHP method, there exist advantages, such as providing con- venience in extension of fuzzy state and ensuring only one result. What is aimed within the implementation is to obtain a more efﬁcient assessment with the total risk value as a measurable output by integrating neuro-fuzzy logic to risk analysis and obtain better results than classic risk assessment models.  Within the scope of methodology mentioned before, the inputs are speciﬁed as dust, unplanned power cut, explosions, chemical leakage, and ventilation system; the data set given in Appendix-A was obtained as a consequence of an elaborative cooperation by the specialists  mining engineer, occupational safety specialist, workplace doctor .  Within the frame of the ﬁrst phase of the study, selection of the membership function is required to be processed with a convenient number and type for each criterion  input . Deﬁning the number of the membership is one of the signiﬁcant issues in the implementation of ANFIS model.  In case of selecting one membership function in relation of each input, the number of the parameter to be trained will be 84; for two membership functions, it will be 168; and for three membership functions, the number will be 252. Within the frame of OHS, in order to obtain a broader study, it was decided to select three   188  Table 1 Error values of membership functions  M. F. Ak  Membership function types trimf trapmf gbellmf gaussmf gauss2mf pimf dsigmf psigmf  Fifty cycle error values 0.000013650 0.000056420 0.000004395 0.000014573 0.000004047 0.000004383 0.000008489 0.000008653  membership functions. Followingly, the most suitable membership function for the model should be determined.  In the study’s process for selecting the membership function types of the inputs, analyzing the result of error values which were received for 50 cycles, it was found that gauss2mf function type gave the least error value.  At this point, the data given in Appendix are named and uploaded as train data  and test data.  Following the criteria selection, the problem changed to become neuro-fuzzy system with ﬁve inputs and one output. In order to deﬁne the number and membership types of the inputs, “Generate FIS” is used. Gauss2mf membership function is selected in the option of “MF Type.” Output “MF Type” option should be selected as “linear.” As mentioned previously, it represents the ﬁrst-degree Sugeno neuro-fuzzy model  Table 1 .  Once the data to be trained is uploaded to ANFIS editor and tested, information the model can be found and the value which is “Epoch 50: error = about 0,000004578.” It means that for this selected membership function type and for each input, 3 triangle membership functions were trained for 50 cycles in accordance with hybrid learning algorithm, and the output value with an error value of 0,000004578 was forecasted accurately.  In ANFIS editor window structure, ANFIS model is shown  Fig. 7 . On the very left side of the ﬁgure, the black nodes represent inputs; three separate second layer nodes which are connected to each node represent membership functions. There are ﬁve inputs, and each input has three membership functions that occur. The output received from the related rules is shown in the ﬁfth layer; the risk value that the system forecasted in the fourth layer is shown in the ﬁfth layer as the output value. In Fig. 8, the rules related to the established model are shown.  The rules descripted in the model can be edited by the specialist users within “Rule Editor.” The ﬁrst ten rules of risk assessment model can be observed in Fig. 8.

After building the data base which includes the risk groups for the underground mining risk analysis study, the effect of each input  risk group  over the total risk value used to be investigated. Since the risk value was expressed with a stochastic term, the process of normalizing in the obtained results was done via Excel. Due to the data used in the study and mining sector’s general structure, error tolerance values are at very low levels. Hence, the datum may differ on percentile and permille basis. The ﬁrst 180 is comprised of training data set, and the last 70 is comprised of test data set. First 18 training data and ﬁrst 7 test data sample can be seen below  Table 2 .  The way for calculating the risk groups’ effect on the total risk values with ANFIS was investigated in OHS risk analysis study with neuro-fuzzy logic approach. The display of the inputs’ fuzzy inference interface is obtained. The structure of the inputs can be edited via membership function editor. For each input three membership functions were assigned. Low, mid, and high verbal values are assigned for these three membership functions  Figs. 9 and 10 .   190  Table 2 ANFIS model output values  Data type Training data  M. F.

The model which was assigned and developed in the beginning was consisted of 5 inputs, 1 output, and 729 rules. The results were obtained and normalized. In accordance with the results, the precautions to be taken were formed by the specialists. Training data set is consisted of 18 data, and the test data set is consisted of 7 data.  One of the most signiﬁcant elements in OHS is risk assessment. Taking the study about the risk assessment in literature in account and risk assessment is a multi- criteria decision-making problem which tackles risk value optimization and includes many criteria. In this study, risk assessment model was obtained by the studies and gap on them in literature, underground mine structure, and also specialist views. In this underground mining-based risk assessment study, after deﬁning the mining and department-based risk groups and hazard groups, the signiﬁcant order of each risk group was deﬁned, and the data set used in risk assessment with the learning feature of ANFIS and its adaptive network-based structure resulted with less error compared to classic methods. The suggested risk assessment model can be used in district-, province-, region-, and country-wide risk assessment stages. The established model with the need of degrading the coefﬁcient of risk of the mines which is among the most signiﬁcant units of underground mining sector. It is consisted of ﬁve total inputs which have three membership functions and seven outputs. In when it will be used bigger data set, the process could take longer. In order to compare the superiority of the fuzzy logic approach on classic and fuzzy risk assessments in the presented OHS, the error values of FAHP and L-matrix output results were compared over the same data set  Table 9 .   194  Table 9 Neuro-fuzzy logic-based approach result comparison  Fig. 11 Risk priorities of hazard types on ventilation system  M.

Explosions is the second most signiﬁcant risk group, and it consists of hazards such as spreading of acidic water around, high slope, contact with acidic water in or around the sulfurous tallow, vehicle crash, damper tipping, and spilling of sulfur material on the way of transport. Chemical leakage is the third highest risk group which consists of hazards such as acidic environment, electric shock, temperature, quality of visibility, and SO2 formation. Unplanned power cut risk group is following chemical leakage with hazards such as paste ﬁll pipeline clogging, being stuck in an elevator, stopping of the pumps, stopping of compressors, rescue chamber energy and air cutoff, cement working equipment, and stopping of the fans. Risk group which has the lowest risk score is dust with hazards of occupational disease, quality of visibility, breakdown of vehicles, and dust explosion. Figures 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 show the priorities of each risk group.  The risk priority orders of the hazard types are obtained with parameters R,S, and Q. There is a negative correlation between parameters and risk signiﬁcance. While the total value of parameters approaches to 0, corresponding risk ranked as highest risk. After obtaining risk priorities for each group, compromised risk rankings are   A Neuro-fuzzy-Based Multi-criteria Risk Evaluation Approach: A Case Study. . .  195  Fig. 12 Risk priorities of hazard types on explosions  Fig. 13 Risk priorities of hazard types on unexplained power cut  found. Figures 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 show the compromised rankings of hazards with respect to their groups.  After deﬁning the risk groups’ signiﬁcant order, the precautions to be taken should be deﬁned accordingly. For this, neuro-fuzzy logic results were assessed by the specialists and the precautions to be taken. The reason behind this idea is elimination of hazards, checking the hazards in their sources, minimization of hazards, and providing the most convenient PPE.  Department-based precautions to be taken are deﬁned.

Intelligent IoT Communication in Smart Environments: An Overview  Joel Poncha Lemayian and Fadi Al-Turjman  1 Introduction  Presently, it is estimated that more than half of the world’s population live in the urban areas. The massive shift from rural to urban areas is projected to continue in the next few decades. Figure 1 shows the comparison of the population living in the rural versus urban places from the year 1950 to 2050 [2]. The author in [5] states that it is projected that 70% of the world’s population will be living in urban areas by the year 2050. This rapid migration is guaranteed to bring about chaos and disorder in the existing destination cities; therefore, we must adapt to the change and create better settlement areas to accommodate more people. Some of the challenges brought about by the rapid population increase in the urban area include waste management problems, scarcity of resources, air pollution, human health concerns, trafﬁc congestions, and scarce, failing, and aging infrastructures, among others. “Smart” cities have emerged as one promising way of solving and controlling the problems faced due to increased population in cities. The author in [5] says that ICT  information and communication technologies  provides the cities with the ability to become “smart,” whereas, it can efﬁciently manage city services. Nevertheless, researchers today have not given this topic much thought, as it supposed to be. Depending on the capital invested, the available land for construction and the technology present and the size and layout of a smart city can vary from small shopping malls to massive multimillion cities. For example, the government of Singapore has agreed to construct a smart city in India, costing about £10.7bn  $16.5bn  [2]. The city has an area of 7235 square kilometers, which is about ten times the size of their own 726-square-kilometer city. Some of the  J. P. Lemayian · F.

Al-Turjman  Fig. 1 Urban and rural population of the world, 1950–2050 [2]  countries that have truly embraced the development of smart cities include the USA, which has the highest number of smart cities according to IoT analytics, South Korea, and Germany.  The “smart” paradigm in smart cities is highly motivated by the ability of a city to be environmentally friendly; cities are edging toward conserving the environment by producing less waste that can pollute the environment and, hence, becoming green and environmentally sustainable [40]. Consequently, these cities are mostly put up in a fairly ﬂat, clear areas, where there are few trees to be cleared to make way for buildings and where the area is easily accessible so that construction materials can easily be transported. Majority of smart cities are made up of high-rise buildings, because these buildings are able to accommodate many people in a fairly small land area. These buildings can either be residential, commercial, or both. There is a massive amount of data transmitted back and forth to a base station, from sensors located all over a smart city  smart parking system, smart trafﬁc light systems, etc.  [41, 43]. The number of base stations and the distance between them is proportional to the size of the smart city; if a city is very big, various substations might need to be set up in order to ensure a safe and fast data transmission system. Moreover, the amount of data transmitted and the distance between transmitters and receivers determine the strength of the signals. Cybersecurity is one of the major challenges faced by smart systems at the moment. As a smart system, smart cities incorporate things like vehicles, homes, public venues, and other social systems which are on their way to gaining full connectivity through the IoT  Internet of Things  paradigm [38, 48]. Therefore, it is critical that both private and public information remain as secure as possible. Another major obstacle that is challenging the development of smart cities is power. Smart cities mostly use solar power for electricity production [33]; however, power production using solar panels is not always reliable, as it is affected by weather conditions such as changing seasons. It is therefore imperative   Intelligent IoT Communication in Smart Environments: An Overview  209  that other forms of green power production are explored so as to power smart cities, for instance, the use of smart solar microgrids using Zigbee suggested by authors in [45].  However, smart cities are more than fast Internet connection, big data transmis- sion, and interlinked applications; rather, the key is to set humans at the core of the smart solution, so as to make the most of the smart technology. As previously stated, several countries around the world have invested in smart cities, and in some places, funding has been done by private organizations. In Africa as well, there are several smart cities springing up in different countries; in particular, South Africa, Egypt, and Kenya are among some of the promising grounds where private organizations have come in to invest in the construction of smart cities.  The rest of this work is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the smart cities around the world. Section 3 gives the structure of a typical smart city, Sect. 4 looks at the ﬂow of information in a smart city, while Sect. 5 talks about the most preferred form of communication system in a smart city. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes the study.  2 Smart Cities Around the World  In this section, we brieﬂy look at some of the top smart cities in different parts of the world. The authors in [1] talk about smart cities around the world, focusing on smart cities found in America, South Korea, and Germany. According to IoT analytics, seven of the top ten IoT smart cities are found in America, with San Francisco taking the ﬁrst position [1]. According to the authors, San Francisco is a host to several small-scale and large-scale IoT companies, including Cisco, Google, Apple, and Intel. However, most of the other cities in the USA lack smart city infrastructures such as ICT infrastructure, for instance, only 7.7% of Americans have access to optical ﬁber Internet, the fastest and the highest quality of Internet connectivity, showing that there is still room for development, even in the most developed countries. However, in a Smart Cities Initiative released in September 2015, President Obama administration recognized the great potential of smart cities in America. This led to the allocation of $ 45 million by the National Science Foundation and National Institute of Standards and Technology to build a research center for smart cities. Additionally, an extra $ 115 million was invested to ﬁnding solutions to public policy challenges. Moreover, the current government has made investment grands totaling about $ 3.4 billion toward smart grid development; this proves that the current government is determined to maintain the current position of the USA in terms of smart city development. Given that US smart city model represents the most market-driven approach of smart cities, it will be very interesting to see the kind of solutions and business models that will be present in a few years. This will certainly have a profound impact on the perception and development of smart cities around the world.   210  L. J. Poncha and F. Al-Turjman  South Korea is one other country with massive smart city development projects in the world; the country has maintained the top position at the United Nations E-Government Development Index since 2003, and this is due to an impeccable ICT infrastructure among other things. In South Korea, there is an escalated use of ultrafast LTE network  4G , making it the most connected city in the world. For instance, in Seoul alone, the local government has sponsored over 831 free Wi- Fi zones; moreover, a major bank in South Korea has funded the installation of chargers at the free Wi-Fi zones, so that everyone can charge their phones while using the Internet. The government of South Korea has recently agreed to upgrade the fourth generation network used in the cities to ﬁfth generation network by the year 2020; this will make the Internet connectivity 1000 times faster. Moreover, in 2014, the European Union backed up the government of South Korea and agreed to be part of developing the ultrafast ﬁfth-generation wireless communications networks  5G  in.  The backbone of smart city development in Germany is sustainable growth, transportation, security, data protection, and how smart solutions help improve energy management to bring about energy efﬁciency. According to [1], in 2010, the German government has started a project to phase out the use of nuclear power; this creates room for the invention of better, greener, and more efﬁcient smart energy sources. Energy efﬁciency is one of the driving factors that is causing Germany to develop smarter ways of power production. For instance, over 140 counties, municipalities, regional associations, and cities in Germany are part of a project called “100 % Erneuerbare-Energie-Regionen.” This project identiﬁes regions in the country that want to convert all their future energy sources to renewable energy. The project supports dedicated regions through communication, transfer, and networking services. Figure 2 shows some of the smartest cities in Europe.  Fig. 2 Smart cities in Europe   Intelligent IoT Communication in Smart Environments: An Overview  211  Fig. 3 What constitutes a smart city  The authors in [10] develop a case study for the “Padova smart city project” in Padova, Italy; the city is an IoT island proof-of-concept developed by private parties in collaboration with the municipality of Padova. In their paper the authors discuss about the fundamentals that were considered and implemented in order to realize the smart city and also the data collected in the ﬁrst few operation days of the city. The main goal of the development of this city was to promote open data and ICT solutions in the public sector. The layout of this city consisted of the use of sensors planted on streetlights to collect and monitor environmental data such as CO level, air temperature and humidity, vibrations, noise, and so on, in order to efﬁciently and accurately manage the streetlighting by measuring the light intensity on each pole. A conceptual sketch of the Padova Smart City system architecture is given in Fig. 3.  3 Smart City Demarcation  As stated by the authors in [3], a smart city is a futuristic urban center, made safe, secure environmentally green, and efﬁcient because all structures, such as water, power, transportation, and the likes, are designed and constructed using the latest technology such as sensors, electronics, and networks and interfaced with com- puterized systems made up of databases, tracking, and decision-making algorithms [32]. Moreover, the author in [4] cites four possible deﬁnitions of intelligent cities.   212  L. J. Poncha and F. Al-Turjman  The ﬁrst one is about the application of a wide range of electronics and digital application to communities and cities, which effectively work to combine the term – smart – with concepts of cyber, digital, wired, informational, or knowledge-based city. A second meaning is the use of information technology to positively transform the livelihood and work of people living in a given region. The third deﬁnition of “intelligent” is associated with the embedded information and communication technology in the city. The ﬁnal deﬁnition is as a paradigm that brings ICTs and people together to enhance knowledge, learning, innovation, and problem-solving. While stating that there is no clear deﬁnition of a smart city, the author in [5] says that governance, technology, communication, transport, infrastructure, people, economy, environment, natural resources, innovation, and quality of living are just some of the few components that factor in on the deﬁnition of a smart city. The author however goes on to explain there have been attempts to warrant a standardized deﬁnition to the term “smart city” by several Standards Developing Organizations  SDOs . One of the deﬁnitions of a smart sustainable city put forward by International Telecommunication Union  ITU  is:  “A smart sustainable city is an innovative city that uses information and communication technologies  ICTs  and other means to improve quality of life, efﬁciency of urban operation and services, and competitiveness, while ensuring that it meets the needs of present and future generations with respect to economic, social and environmental aspects.”  The author in [5] concurs that there are quite a number of ways used to describe “smart city,” each with its own valid reasons; the author also agrees that there is a need to develop a compressive deﬁnition which addresses all of these viewpoints and answer the question “What constitutes a smart city?” Consequently, in order to develop such a description, Kondepudi et al. [5] developed a detailed and precise analysis in the form of a blend of “top-down and bottom-up approaches.” Figure 3 shows the approach followed by the authors so as to ﬁnd out what constitutes a smart city.  On the other hand, Gifﬁnger et al. [6] list four components that constitute a smart city; these are industry, education, participation, and technical infrastructure. However, this list has been extended in a recent study conducted by the Centre of Regional Science at the Vienna University of Technology for up to six components; these are smart economy, smart mobility, a smart environment, smart people, smart living, and smart governance [7]. Moreover, Lombardi et al. [8] have associated the six components with different aspects of urban life. Table 1 shows the summery of the related aspects.  4 A Connected City  The authors in [10] claim that there is no formal deﬁnition of the term “smart city”; however, the authors go on to say that the main goal of a smart city is to provide better and reliable services to the people at a minimum cost; this can   Intelligent IoT Communication in Smart Environments: An Overview  213  Table 1 Abbreviations used in this work  Abbreviation Description IoT SOM ICT SDOs ITU IPv4 IPv6 SSL HTTP TCP CoAP UDP 6LoWPAN  Internet of Things Smart outdoor monitoring Information communication technology Standards Developing Organizations International Telecommunication Union Internet Protocol Version 4 Internet Protocol Version 6 Secure Sockets Layer Hypertext Transfer Protocol Transmission Control Protocol Constrained Application Protocol User Datagram Protocol IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network Recognition of prior learning European Union Vehicle-to-vehicle COoperative Trafﬁc congestion detECtion Global positioning system Radio-frequency identiﬁcation Near-ﬁeld communication Local area network Wireless sensor network Machine-type communications Voice over Internet protocol Quality of service Long-Term Evolution Long Term Evolution-Advanced Fifth generation network Fourth generation network Third generation network  RPL EU V2V CoTEC GPS RFID NFC LAN WSN MTC VoIP QoS LTE LTE-A 5G 4G 3G  be done by deploying the use of urban IoT [10]. It is a communication charnel that connects the entire urban area, easing up management and operation of public resources  transport and parking, lighting, surveillance and maintenance of public areas, preservation of cultural heritage, garbage collection, salubrity of hospitals, and school  and opening up a surplus of other possibilities. For instance, the data collected by sensors can be used to provide transparency to the people and hence leading to better management and the use of public resource [31]. It is therefore prudent to say that IoT is what connects our cities and ultimately turns an urban settlement into a smart city.  The authors in [9] state that IoT is a next-generation communication paradigm which envisions that the objects of everyday life are provided with communication   214  L. J. Poncha and F. Al-Turjman  capabilities, that is, equipped with microcontrollers, transceivers for digital commu- nication, and suitable protocol stacks that will allow them to talk to each other and hence becoming an integral part of the Internet. Thus, the IoT purposes at making the Internet more immersive and universal. Moreover, by enabling access to “things” such as home appliances, surveillance cameras, monitoring sensors, actuators, displays, vehicles, and so on, the IoT open doors to the development of countless applications that make use of the enormous and variant data collected. Additionally, the systems developed are used to provide services to the general public and private and public organization. This paradigm is applied in so many other areas such as home automation, trafﬁc management, elderly assistance, industrial automation, medical aids, automotive, mobile healthcare [37], intelligent energy management, and smart grids, among many others [11]. For the rest of this section, we look at how IoT inﬂuences selected services in a smart city to bring about advantages such as enhancing the quality of services offered to the people and increasing their quality of life while reducing the cost of operation for the city [12]  Fig. 4 and Table 2 .  Structural Health of Buildings For proper maintenance of historic landmarks, such as old buildings in a city, it is imperative to carry out continued monitoring and restoration of structures. IoT allows for a continuous inspection of this buildings and a timely repair, hence saving time and money. IoT can facilitate the creation  Fig. 4 System architecture of “Padova Smart City”  Table 2 Smart city components and its related aspects  Components of a smart city Related aspect of urban life Smart economy Smart people Smart governance Smart mobility Smart environment Smart living  Industry Education E-democracy Logistics and infrastructures Efﬁciency and sustainability Security and quality   Intelligent IoT Communication in Smart Environments: An Overview  215  of a database that consists of data collected by the sensors  e.g., vibration and deformation sensors, atmospheric agent sensors, temperature, and humidity sensors [13]  deployed on the buildings. The information in the database will be, for instance, the stress condition of the building, climatic condition around the building, the amount of pollution caused by the building, and the likes. This information will be available to the public, and most of all, the information can be used to predict the stability of the city to withstand natural phenomena such as earthquakes and tsunamis. The practical realization of this system, however, requires the investment of some initial capital, since there is a need to install sensors on the buildings and the surrounding environment and their interconnection to the database network [10].  Waste Management This is one major issue faced by most cities around the world, because of the high cost of operation and the environmental impact cause by dumping sites. However, if we indulge ICT in the waste management project, we will beneﬁt more, for instance, the author in [14] talks about intelligent waste containers. The containers detect when it is full and communicate to the base and hence enable a timely collection and reduce operation cost; moreover, the containers also improve recycling quality. The containers are connected to a base station where an optimization software calculates an optimal route for the garbage collecting ﬂeet.  Air Quality Global warming has brought about major environmental hazards, rising sea levels, melting ice caps in the polar regions, long dry seasons, and so on. Recently, many countries and organizations around the world decided to join forces to reduce global warming. The EU, among them, decided to reduce greenhouse gas emission by 20% by the year 2020, reduce energy consumption by 20% by the year 2020, and increase the use of renewable energy sources by 20% by the year 2020 [10]. To that extent, adoption of intelligent cities can greatly help in achieving this goal by monitoring the environmental condition in areas such as crowded places, parks, or ﬁtness trails [15]. Moreover, the data collected by the air quality and pollution sensors can be stored in a database that is accessible to the public. This data can be helpful to people who conduct their activities outdoor, for instance, joggers can be provided with the ultimate route suitable for jogging.  Noise Monitoring Noise can be deﬁned as a collection of sounds that is loud, irritating, and annoying to the listener. It can also cause hearing problems if it is loud enough. Many people experience noise indoors and outdoors [16]. A smart city can offer noise monitoring services to measure noise at speciﬁc areas at a given time [17]. Moreover, the sound-detecting services can be enhanced by means of a sound- detecting algorithm to decipher vandalism noises like braking glass and alerting a security department [36] and hence keeping the area safe for business developers. However, the deployment of sound detectors or environmental microphones is quite debatable because of the obvious reason of privacy [10].  Trafﬁc Congestion The mystery of trafﬁc congestion is one of the major puzzles faced by major cities around the world. Although trafﬁc cameras have helped ease the congestion, low energy and widespread communication can greatly improve the efﬁciency of trafﬁc monitoring. Trafﬁc congestion can be realized in a smart   216  L. J. Poncha and F. Al-Turjman  city by deploying sensors along some major roads and using GPS capabilities installed in modern vehicles [18]. Moreover, the author in [19] proposes CoTEC  COoperative Trafﬁc congestion detECtion , a system that uses vehicle-to-vehicle  V2V  communications to detect and control trafﬁc without the need to deploy sensors. Nevertheless, the variant information collected by the sensors can be very useful to city authorities by detecting accident sites [39, 42, 44] and to citizens by helping them plan for an efﬁcient route to the city.  City Energy Consumption In smart cities, it is also possible to measure the overall energy consumption of the city. This will give the authorities and citizens a clear analysis of how much power is being used in different sectors, for instance, public lighting, transportation, trafﬁc lights, control cameras, heating cooling of public buildings, and so on. In order to achieve this, power monitoring devices must be incorporated into the grid. This system can help the EU achieve their set goal to reduce power consumption by 20% in the coming years [10].  Smart Parking This system is made up of road sensors and smart displays, which are used to guide a driver to an available parking spot in a smart city [20, 46, 48]. There are a number of advantages brought about by this system, less time to locate a packing slot, leading to less CO emission, less trafﬁc, and happier clients. Moreover, the use of short-range communication technology, such as radio- frequency identiﬁcation  RFID  or near-ﬁeld communication  NFC , can be used to model an electronic veriﬁcation system for reserved and disable parking spaces and hence leading to better management of the parking lot [47].  Smart Lighting In order to reduce the overall city power consumption, streetlights have to be modeled to automatically adjust depending on the time of the day, weather conditions, and the presence of people. In a smart city, such systems can be incorporated using the already existing weather and sound sensors and hence reducing power consumption [34, 35]. The authors in [21] talk about the importance of a smart city in the modern world and go on to highlight that one key goal of a smart city is to reduce power consumption. Moreover, the main topic given by the authors is how to reach an interoperable smart lighting solution over the emerging M2M protocols.  Automation and Salubrity of Public Buildings One other important aspect of IoT in smart cities is the ability to monitor and control energy consumption and salubrity in public places such as schools, sport centers, and museums. This is done by the deployment of sensors that measure lights, temperature, and humidity in and around the buildings. The ability to control and regulate this parameter allows us to enhance the comfort of people in these buildings and, in some cases, increase productivity [22].  As evidently depicted in the presiding sections, communication in a smart city involves the exchange of big data from all the interconnected infrastructure elements. We therefore must have a network system in place that is efﬁcient enough to handle such a massive movement of sensitive information.   Intelligent IoT Communication in Smart Environments: An Overview  217  5 Telecommunication in Smart Cities  Information and communication are key to the intelligent city of tomorrow. Communication, data exchange, and interconnectedness are the foundation for all other key subjects of a smart city: power supply, mobility, and public safety. In this section, we look at the most suitable channel of communication in a smart city. To start from the top, we ﬁrst consider guided and unguided communication channels. Guided communication channel, or wired communication, is where the communication devices are directly connected to each other through a cable. Guided communication channels are commonly known as LAN. Some examples include coaxial cable, twisted pair wire, and ﬁber-optic cable. On the other hand, an unguided communication channel is a system where data is transferred in the form of a wave; this means that data does not follow a speciﬁc path. Moreover, information can be send all over the world. This system is commonly known as wireless communication; some examples are microwave, cellular radio, radio broadcast, and satellite. In a smart city paradigm, developers are looking for new ways to maximize their investment in communication networks while ensuring reliable and secure data transmission, in light of that, while both channels have a place in utility market applications, such as distribution mechanization, we are beginning to see an increase in the use of wireless systems network. The authors in [23] state that the use of wireless network as opposed to wired will cut down the installations and repairment cost.  Compared to ﬁber optics, for example, wireless communication systems are much easier to maintain. If a buried cable is damaged, it will take a lot of time, manpower, and money to repair. Nevertheless, wireless systems send a notiﬁcation if any maintenance is required and can prevent the actual damage from occurring; however, in case maintenance is required, fewer personnel are needed to repair a wireless system compared to a wired system, consequently, saving time and money. Moreover, cables are priced by their length  miles, meters, feet , while wireless data radios’ pricing includes ranges expressed in miles. Vandalism is one other major challenge facing the wired system. The transmission cables are usually made of expensive metal, such as copper; therefore, these cables are prone to be vandalized by thieves; a research done by Sidebottom et al. [23], on the theft of coper cables on the British railway network, show that there is an increased number of vandalized cables when the market price for copper goes high. High costs, difﬁcult installations, copper theft, and more are just some of the factors that is driving investors to choose wireless communication over wired. In many industries including the military, there is evidence that wireless communication is a viable alternative. These technologies provide long-range, reliable, and affordable solutions. WSN technology can potentially save related companies millions of dollars in installation cost.  In the modern IoT connectivity landscape, 3G and 4G are the most engaging form of connectivity. These platforms offer extensive coverage, quite low deployment costs, high security levels, and simplicity in management [23]. However, there is   218  L. J. Poncha and F. Al-Turjman  one drawback, since the systems were designed for optimized broadband telecom- munication; they do not support low-cost machine-type communications  MTC  – a fundamental aspect in the realization of a smart city. Consequently, we look at how 5G will improve its predecessors and move us closer to developing a smarter city.  Palattella et al. [25] provide an in-depth analysis about the potential of 5G technologies for the IoT. The authors state that 5G has an edge compared to 4G and 3G. The increased data rate, reduced end-to-end latency, and improved coverage equip 5G to handle even the most demanding and sophisticated application in IoT in relation to user satisfaction and the communication requirements. The development of 5G as a heterogeneous system, that is, the ability to facilitate the interconnection of a myriad of “things” with the Internet, puts it forward as a uniﬁed interconnected framework [25]. Moreover, ﬁfth-generation wireless technologies will also provide very high-speed broadband wireless connectivity and offer various services such as documentation services, supporting fast electronic transactions such as e-payment, e-transaction, and the likes [25]. Voice over Internet protocol  VoIP  is a connection of devices over the Internet using their IP address, where voice data is send over the connection. VoIP is the fastest-growing communication technology [26]. The author in [27] says that compared to contemporary telephone networks, VoIP has two main advantages, improved bandwidth efﬁciency and the ability to facilitate the creation of new services that will be able to combine voice communication with other media and data applications. 5G mainly focuses on VoIP devices to warrant that users experience high level of call volume and data transmission [28]. 5G is speciﬁcally designed to provide quality of service to its users, by providing maximum bandwidth. Moreover, 5G has also been able to overcome some other network challenges such as latency, error rate, and uptime. Zhang et al. [29] say that 5G is expected to provide QoS by guaranteeing low latency to a wide spectrum of services, users, and applications with varied requirements.  The authors in [30] highlight some examples of 5G deployment infrastructure: integrated radio base station, centralized baseband, and radio-over-copper solutions. 5G networks have a limited communication range; therefore, a high number of cells need to be deployed so as to cover a large area. Consequently, at the beginning, the service providers need not abandon the use of the prevailing LTE and LTE-A-based infrastructure.  6 Conclusion  Smart cities are the future of urban development. Current advancement in technol- ogy, especially in medicine, is changing the lives of many people and increasing life expectancy; this means that there is a continuous population increase. Figure 1 shows that there has been a constant increase in the number of people living in urban areas since 1950. Smart cities provide a sure solution to some of the challenges brought about by overpopulation: waste management problems, scarcity of resources, air pollution, human health concerns, trafﬁc congestions, and failing   Intelligent IoT Communication in Smart Environments: An Overview  219  and aging infrastructures, among others. However, intelligent cities are only as good as the interconnection of devices used to collect and transmit information such as sensors in vehicles and streetlights and health monitoring devices in patients. Consequently, there is a large amount of information that is collected and analyzed every day in a smart city; it is imperative that this information be transmitted as fast as possible and, most importantly, as secure as possible. Internet of Things  IoT  is an ecosystem of interconnected physical devices, accessible through the Internet; this ecosystem will have a huge impact in the communication system of a smart city. As discussed in this study, wireless communication is highly preferred as a means of communication in a smart city topology as opposed to wired, with 5G possessing most the ideal requirements.
