How do videogamers uti- lize liminal space to form connections between themselves and their avatars? To answer this question I use James Gee’s identity theoretical constructs of real-world identity, virtual world identity, and projective identity as a frame for data collection and analysis. Phenomenological data  oral interviews and video gameplay transcription and analysis  was collected from four partici- pants. Two “die-hard” videogaming veterans played Morrowind, one casual gamer played Oblivion, and one non-gamer played Fallout 3. These partici- pants had varying levels of videogame literacy and interest in the role-play- ing  genre  of  videogames;  I  wanted  to  see  if  these  factors  impacted  user identiﬁcation  with  their  avatars.  Findings  indicate  that  the  relationships between the virtual avatar and the “real-world” users were dynamic and com- plex: the real-world identities continually informed the virtual identities of the avatars, despite widely varying levels of user immersion and conscious diegetic identiﬁcation. This study models one methodological approach for the collection, transcription, and analysis of videogame data. I also recom- mend the creation of two new terms to aid in the formation of reliable and consistent  terminology  in  the  ﬁeld  of  videogame  theory.  First,  the  term  “real-world” identity  used by Gee and other scholars to describe non-vir- tual identities  was found to be problematic. This study found that virtual identities, created and maintained by users’ non-virtual identities, may be just as “real” to users as their non-virtual identities. Therefore, this study rec- ommends replacing the term “real-world” with “non-virtual” for future stud- ies on identity construction in virtual spaces, thus creating a more accurate terminological  continuum.  Second,  the  study  also  suggests  creation  of  the term “verisimulacratude” to help describe how users identify with and become immersed in videogames set in fantastical simulacra-like gameworlds. Cre- ation of the new terminological continuua virtual non-virtual and verisim- ulacratude verisimilitude allows scholars to more accurately study the rhetoric of videogames and identity construction within virtual diegetic spaces.  1   This page intentionally left blank   Videogames, Avatars, and Identity  A Brief History  Our connection to the real world is very thin, and our connection with the artiﬁcial world is going to be more intimate and satisfying than any- thing that’s come before.  — Marvin Minsky, MIT scientist, 1989  We may not want to acknowledge a connection between ourselves and the mechanical  world,  but  to  be  alive  in  our  time  is  to  be  faced  with  this reﬂection, like it or not.  — Janet Murray, technology theorist, 1997  It is September of 1999. A Thursday night. I should be asleep by now, but I’m not. Tomorrow is a teaching day, and I have to get up early. I roll over,  pounding  my  pillow  in  frustration.  I  glance  at  the  digital  clock:  the smug 11:53 P.M. mocks me. “Only ﬁve hours until you need to get up,” it seems to say. Dammit. I close my eyes, trying to drift down into sleep. But it’s no use: my mind ﬁlls with images of giant geckos and plasma riﬂes, supermu- tants and radioactive ghouls. Frantically, I struggle to clear my head. Relax. Just relax. But I can’t: I am Zach the Chosen One, and have much on my mind.  Should  I  visit  Redding  or  Reno  next?  Is  my  Small  Guns  skill  high enough to help me survive if I’m ambushed in the Wastes? Will I come to regret not freeing the slaves in the Den? Should I have opted for a higher Per- ception skill when creating Zach, given my penchant for long-distance snip- ing? I can’t stop these thoughts. I am powerless to control my mind. Sighing, I look at the clock once more: 12:17 A.M. What is wrong with me? How can I obsess this much over a videogame? Sure, Fallout 2 is a great game: terriﬁc story, open-ended gameplay, incredibly deep customization options. But it is still just a game, a ﬁction. Resigned to a poor night’s sleep, I vow never to get this hooked on a virtual world during the middle of a semester ever again.... It is February of 2008. Groaning inwardly, I squint at the pale blue glow of my old nemesis: 1:02 A.M. Not again. Tomorrow is a long day, with com- mittee meetings late in the afternoon after an early spate of classes. I needed  1  3   4  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  to  be  asleep  75  minutes  ago.  When  will  I  learn?  I  thought  just  an  hour wouldn’t hurt me, but here I am, unable to get that haunting music out of my head. It’s triumphal and orchestric: great for inspiring me while grading papers, but lousy as a sleep aid. Plus, I’m reliving my last foray into the Obliv- ion  gate  near  Kvatch.  Those  scamps  really  piss  me  off,  and  it  is  becoming increasingly  clear  that  I’m  going  to  need  to  improve  both  my  Destruction magic skill and my Marksman skill before I go back in. I might need new armor too. Zach the Wood Elf just isn’t as strong as he needs to be. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is consuming me, piece by mental piece. I can’t stop play- ing, even though the demands of this semester’s teaching load are calling for attention. Just one more hour, and I can ﬁnish the slaughterﬁsh quest. Just one more hour, and I can buy Zach a new pair of boots. Just one more hour, and I can increase my Alchemy skill three times. Just. One. More. Hour.  Okay, I obviously didn’t learn my lesson after spending more than 100 hours playing Fallout 2. It’s almost a decade later, and I’m still investing copi- ous amounts of time and energy in virtual videogame worlds. Oblivion is just my latest addiction. Somehow, video roleplaying-games  v–RPGs  speak to me, whisper to my soul. It is hard to explain why this happens, but this book is my attempt to do so. At least I can take comfort in knowing that I’m not alone: Oblivion has sold more than two million copies worldwide. Massively multiplayer online role-playing games  MMORPGs  like World of Warcraft have several million subscribers as well. Videogame revenue now reaches sev- eral billion dollars annually in the United States alone  with global ﬁgures expected to pass $50 billion in 2009 . Clearly, other players enjoy videogames as much as I do. But do other v–RPGers care as much about their avatars as I  do  about  mine?  Am  I  alone  in  my  virtual  obsessions,  having  contracted some sort of virtu-virus or techno-schizophrenia? The words of videogame theorist Arthur Asa Berger, written in 2002, resonate with me, but offer cold comfort:  “Playing  video  games  may  lead  to  alienation;  this  alienation  can often lead to a sense of estrangement from oneself ... what is difﬁcult to know is how being immersed will affect players. Will new video games become a kind of opiate for people who can ﬁnd an outlet in simulations that seem better  than  those  offered  by  their  real-life  experiences?”   107–108 .  Hmm. Estranged from my self. That doesn’t seem to ﬁt how I feel about Zach the Wood Elf. My relationship with my avatar seems more complicated than that. Exactly how I believe it is more complicated  for other videogamers as well as myself   and will take some explaining, as videogame technologies offer users interactive and immersive experiences that convey verisimilitude and beyond more with each passing year.  In the epigraphs that introduce this chapter Marvin Minsky and Janet Murray  acknowledge  humanity’s  connections  to  technologically-produced   1. Videogames, Avatars, and Identity  5  worlds. Indeed, they were among the ﬁrst scholars to theorize and explore these connections. Berger was one of the scholars who ﬁrst turned this crit- ical gaze to the phenomenon of videogames; his statement above reﬂects the uncertainty felt by many about how exactly videogames affect the identities of those who interact with them. In this book, I continue this investigation into the relationships between virtual identities and non-virtual identities, primarily in video role-playing games. Using James P. Gee’s identity theo- retical constructs of real-world identity, virtual world identity, and projec- tive  identity,  I  analyze  the  connections   via  projective  identity  in  liminal space  between the real-world identities of videogame users and their diegetic avatars:  virtual-world  identities.  To  gather  data  for  this  project,  I  worked closely with four primary participants, conducting oral interviews, record- ing,  transcribing,  and  analyzing  their  videogame  play  experiences  in  the V–RPGs Morrowind, Oblivion, and Fallout 3. I also collected data online from the  devoted  denizens  of  Morrowind and  Oblivion to  better  understand videogamers’  connections  to  the  virtual  personalities  and  bodies  of  their avatars. Who are we when we’re also someone else in virtual play and space? The  connections  between  videogamers  and  their  virtual  counterparts  are complex indeed, as I hope you’ll soon agree. In this ﬁrst chapter I provide a brief  history  of  the  rise  of  videogames  as  a  popular  culture  entertainment medium leading to the development of diegetic avatars in video role-play- ing games. I then discuss Gee’s identity theoretical constructs and use them to analyze postings related to identity formation in the Morrowind and Obliv- ion online forums at Elderscrolls.com to demonstrate the need for my explo- ration into the connections between videogamers and their virtual identities.  A Brief History of Video Games  At the time of this writing in 2008, videogames have been in existence for  over  40  years.  In 1962,  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  scholars Steve Russell, Martin Graetz, Wayne Wiitanen, and Alan Kotok took advan- tage of access to MIT’s powerful computers and in their spare time designed Spacewar!, widely considered to be the ﬁrst computer game. Spacewar! dis- played two spaceships  actually small “blips” of light displayed on the CRT monitor  trying to shoot each other while avoiding a star in the middle of the  screen.  Two  people  could  play  at  the  same  time,  each  controlling  one spaceship by manipulating several switches and knobs on the computer. Space- war! was difﬁcult to control and play, even for the designers, yet in the days and weeks that followed, MIT students waited in long lines to play Spacewar! or to simply watch fellow students play the game  Robinett ix .  Of course, few computers were as powerful as MIT’s, and it took nearly   6  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  ten  years  before  videogame  technology  became  feasible  commercially  and economically. In 1971, Computer Space ofﬁcially became the ﬁrst commercial videogame. Computer Space was modeled on Spacewar! with a simpliﬁed con- trol lever  what we would recognize today as a “joystick” . Still, Computer Space was difﬁcult to play, and the game was not a commercial success. The distinction of being the ﬁrst commercially successful videogame belongs to PONG  a simpliﬁed version of table tennis , which debuted in 1972 in arcades across the United States. PONG’s immense popularity encouraged the cre- ation of other coin-operated video arcade games as well as the creation of the ﬁrst  home  game  console  system1 in  1972,  the  Magnavox  Odyssey,  which shipped with a version of PONG.  And so it all began. As Mark Wolf points out, videogames in arcades were the ﬁrst computers many Americans ever used, and the home videogame sys- tems were often the ﬁrst home computers as well. In 1976, the Fairchild Zir- con  Channel  F  was  the  ﬁrst  home  videogame  console  system  to  offer cartridge-based technology: individual videogames were contained on “car- tridges” that could be plugged into the game system. The Zircon Channel F was a colossal failure: users didn’t ﬁnd any of the games designed for it enjoy- able to play. However, Nolan Bushnell was convinced that the idea of car- tridge-based technology was sound, and in 1977 his company came out with a cartridge-based system of their own: the Atari 2600. It turns out Bushnell was  right:  the  Atari  2600  became  arguably  the  most  important  system  in videogame history, selling millions of units and tens of millions of videogames on cartridges. Other manufacturers quickly moved to take advantage of the videogame demand created by the Atari 2600, and dozens of home videogame consoles ﬂooded the market — too many, in point of fact.2 In 1983 and 1984, the  market  for  home  videogames  crashed   aided  by  the  production  of  too many games in 1983 and too few in 1984 , and many console videogame man- ufacturers in North America went out of business.  Yet videogames did not die out. Video arcades continued to do well, and in  1985,  a  new  console  system  from  Japan  was  introduced:  the  Nintendo Entertainment System  NES . By 1987, the NES’s popularity rivaled that of the Atari 2600 at its peak  Wolf 5 . Home computer technology also advanced to the point where “cartridges” became possible there as well: ﬂoppy disks  and later CD-ROMs  containing videogames created a healthy competitive market between videogame console games and videogames designed for home computers. This competition continues to this day, as “next generation” con- sole systems such as the Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and Nintendo Wii compete against the ever-faster processing speeds, larger memory capacities, bleed- ing-edge soundcards, and DVD drives of home personal computers  PCs . There are many other important “ﬁrsts” in the history of videogames in   1. Videogames, Avatars, and Identity  7  addition to the ones already mentioned. In 1980 the arcade game Battlezone, a tank simulator, offered a ﬁrst-person point of view  POV , allowing users to play “through the eyes” of a tank commander. in 1982 Zaxxon unveiled an isometric perspective, showing three sides of an object  in this case the space- ship controlled by the user  instead of just one, which allowed for unprece- dented  visual  depth  and  perspective. Dragon’s  Lair  1983   used  laser-disc technology. Wolfenstein 3D  1992  ﬁlled in the ﬁrst-person POV vector lines created for Battlezone and became the ﬁrst truly “immersive” three-dimen- sional   3D   game,  putting  the  user  “into”  the  gaming  world  in  a  way  that hadn’t been done before. With the advent of CD-ROM technology in 1992, two 1993 PC games quickly became historically signiﬁcant, breaking all past sales  records: Doom and  Myst.  Interestingly  enough,  as  games,  these  two offered immensely different gaming experiences. Doom perfected the visceral, high action “ﬁrst-person shooter” formula created by Wolfenstein 3D, while Myst offered almost no action, focusing instead on spatial exploration and puzzle-solving. The 1980’s saw the ﬁrst online games, text-based multi-user dimensions  MUDs  played over modems. Air Warrior became in 1987 the ﬁrst massively multiplayer online game  MMOG  to incorporate graphics, paving the way for Ultima Online  1997 , Everquest  1999  and World of War- craft  2004   to  create  elaborate  graphical  online  worlds  with  hundreds  of thousands of online users.  Avatars and Videogames  As this brief history suggests, there have been many landmark achieve- ments in the history of videogames,3 leading us to where we are now: in 2007, video and computer game software sales exceeded nine billion dollars in the United States. Over 267 million video and computer game units were sold in this country as well  Entertainment Software Association . The new medium of videogames is now poised to surpass cinema as the most lucrative enter- tainment medium the United States has ever known. Why? What is it about videogames  that  captivate  so  many  users  of  all  ages?  Mark  Wolf  helps  us understand this phenomenon by pointing out how truly unique videogames are from their main competitors, cinema and television: videogames are “the ﬁrst [medium] to combine real-time game play with a navigable, onscreen diegetic space [and] the ﬁrst to feature avatars and player-controlled surro- gates that could inﬂuence onscreen events: real-time user interaction in one machine”  11, 5 . Here, Wolf suggests that real-time user interactivity within the game space, via avatars, is crucial to videogame popularity and success. Avatars. It’s time I deﬁned and complicated this essential term. What are they, and why are they so important to videogames? Videogame scholars   8  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  apply the term in several different ways, but the origins of the word are clear. Avatara, meaning “descent,” is a Sanskrit word that in Hinduism refers to an incarnation, a bodily manifestation, of an immortal being. Hindu gods and goddesses  use  avatars  as  necessary  when  they  want  to  access  the  physical, mortal world of humanity. However, with the rise of computer technology and the virtual spaces made possible by this technology, the term “avatar”  has been applied to videogames with several competing deﬁnitions.4 In the broadest sense, an avatar is “the user’s representative in the virtual universe”  Filiciak 89 . Chris Crawford describes avatars in a similar way: “virtual con- structs that are controlled by human players and function as a means of inter- acting with other characters”  Berger 33 . These deﬁnitions combine Wolf ’s above  notions  of  “avatar”  and  “player-controlled  surrogates”  and  seem  to cover  any  on-screen  representation  controlled  by  the  user.  Under  these deﬁnitions, the small “blip” of light in Spacewar! representing the user’s space- ship would be an avatar. Bob Rehak, using Miroslaw Filiciak’s deﬁnition, pro- vides a brief history of signiﬁcant avatar moments in videogames beginning with Spacewar! He highlights Pac-Man as providing the ﬁrst “alive” avatar: Pac-Man is portrayed as an organic creature, rather than a machine. All pre- vious videogames had the user controlling either spaceships or other machines  like the ground-defense turrets of Space Invaders ; being given control of an organic creature was a new idea. As previously mentioned, Battlezone allowed the user to operate from “inside” the avatar  a tank  from a ﬁrst-person POV. Myst also provided a ﬁrst-person POV, but was revolutionary for its empha- sis on spatial exploration over narrative  an important distinction I’ll return to later in chapter two . Quake was the ﬁrst videogame that allowed the user to change the appearance of the avatar, offering several different “skins” the user could choose from. Using this simpliﬁed deﬁnition, avatars have been present since the inception of videogames.  At the beginning of this chapter, I provided the following statement from Marvin Minsky: “Our connection to the real world is very thin, and our con- nection with the artiﬁcial world is going to be more intimate and satisfying than anything that’s come before”  161 . Filiciak  perhaps inﬂuenced by the ﬁlm EXistenZ  adds the following sentiments about the connections between real and artiﬁcial worlds: “In the foreseeable future [of videogames the] dif- ferentiation between artiﬁcial and real or between outside and inside will be blurred”  98 . When considering these two statements it is difﬁcult to imag- ine a user’s connection to  Pac-Man  or even Tomb Raider’s Lara Croft  as being  more  “intimate  and  satisfying”  than  the  interactions  with  friends  at work or at school. So too is it difﬁcult to imagine a user blurring the distinc- tion between videogame play where she is “inside” her Zaxxon ﬁghter jet or in control of Dirk the Daring in Dragon’s Lair and “outside” activities like   1. Videogames, Avatars, and Identity  9  taking  a  calculus  test  or  eating  dinner  at  a  pizza  parlor.  What  is  it  about videogames and videogame avatars that lead to the notions espoused by Min- sky and Filiciak that speculate on the blurring between real and virtual iden- tities?  To  begin  to  answer  this  question  it  is  necessary  to  further  reﬁne  the deﬁnition of “avatar” in relationship to videogames. Athomas Goldberg aids this process by distinguishing between “avatars” and “agents.” He deﬁnes a virtual avatar as any “representations of ‘real’ people in computer-generated environment[s]” and agents as “any semiautonomous pieces of software that assume  some  visual  embodiment”   161 .  Distinguishing  between  virtual avatars and agents is helpful, but Goldberg’s deﬁnitions are still too vague: Pac-Man could be identiﬁed as either an avatar  since Pac-Man represents the user in the gameworld maze  or an agent  since it is the on-screen embod- iment of semiautonomous software . Further reﬁnement in the deﬁnition of avatar is needed to avoid this ambiguity, and Laetitia Wilson succeeds in pro- viding it:  [An avatar is] a virtual, surrogate self that acts as a stand in for our real-space selves, that represents the user. The cyberspace avatar func- tions as a locus that is multifarious and polymorphous, displaced from the  facticity  of  our  real-space  selves....  Avatar  spaces  indisputably involve choice in the creation of one’s avatar; there is substantial scope in which to exercise choice and create meaning [within the video game] [2–3].  This notion of creative choice is crucial to not only deﬁning avatars in vir- tual  spaces  but  also  to  understanding  exactly  how  users  connect  with videogames and become immersed within them. Using Wilson’s criterion of creative choice, it becomes much easier to distinguish between videogame avatars and agents. Pac-Man cannot be altered in any way by the user. He can only be controlled. His appearance and skills never change throughout the course of the game. This makes Pac-Man an agent. The same holds true for Spacewar!’s spaceship, Lara Croft of Tomb Raider fame, Mario of Super Mario  Bros.,  Frogger,  Sonic  the  Hedgehog,  Duke  Nukem,  Grand  Theft  Auto: Vice  City’s  Tommy  Vercetti,  and Perfect  Dark’s  Joanna  Dark.  All  of  these famous videogame characters are agents, as they can only be controlled by the user, never altered in appearance or skill level.  Users and Avatars: Relationships  In fact, when considering this much more restricted deﬁnition for avatars  the  necessity  for  the  user  to  have  much  creative  control  over  the  agent’s appearance, skills, and attributes  it becomes clear that most of the control-   10  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  lable characters in video games are agents rather than avatars. What genre of videogame  allows  the  user  to  have  creative  license  to  construct  an  avatar, then? To move forward in answering this question I must ﬁrst go back: in 1997, Janet Murray’s landmark Hamlet on the Holodeck: The Future of Narra- tive in Cyberspace was published. In that work, Murray focused on how com- puter  technology  would  impact  the  evolution  of  narrative  stories  and established many terms and concepts that remain crucial to the theoretical landscape  of  computer  and  videogame  technology.  She  acknowledged  the importance of cyber-games and of game play in general:  In games we have a chance to enact our most basic relationship to the world — our desire to prevail over adversity, to survive our inevitable defeats, to shape our environment, to master complexity, and to make our lives ﬁt together like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Like the reli- gious ceremonies of passage by which we mark birth, coming of age, marriage, and death, games are ritual actions allowing us to symboli- cally enact the patterns that give meaning to our lives [143].  By placing game play as a rite of passage alongside such events as birth, mar- riage, and death, Murray reveals just how important she believes game play to be in human meaning-making. How exactly can videogames achieve this meaning-making? Earlier in her book, Murray describes her own experiences playing an arcade Western-themed shooter game named Mad Dog McCree, which used cinematic video and put a laser pistol in the user’s hands to engage in gunﬁght after gunﬁght. Murray described the moment she became aware that she was both paciﬁst mother and cyber gunslinger: “I was conscious of being two very different people. I would not claim that Mad Dog McCree was a  masterful  piece  of  storytelling.  But  the  moment  of  self-confrontation  it provoked, the moment in which I was suddenly aware of an authentic but disquieting side of myself, seems to me to be the mark of a new kind of dra- matic experience”  54 . Clearly a rich and compelling narrative was not nec- essary for Murray’s experience playing the game to be signiﬁcant as it forced her to become aware of parts of herself she had been previously unaware of. And Mad Dog McCree is a game that provides neither agent nor avatar: the user simply points their laser gun at the video screen, aims, and attempts to hit  the  targets.  If  Murray  could  come  to  such  self-awareness  without  any avatar present, and if, as Rehak and other scholars suggest, the most crucial relationship in video games is between user and avatar, then how much more powerful  might  Murray’s  experience  have  been  if  undertaken  through  an avatar? How can we characterize the relationships between a user and their avatar in a videogame world?  Several  videogame  scholars  have  theorized  about  the  relationship between users and their virtual world avatars; this work reveals much uncer-   1. Videogames, Avatars, and Identity  11  tainty about the connections between the two. Katherine Hayles writes, “The avatar both is and is not present, just as the user both is and is not inside the screen”  38 . Similarly, Rehak suggests:  [The avatar’s] behavior is tied to the player’s through an interface: its literal motion, as well as its ﬁgurative triumphs and defeats, result from the player’s actions. At the same time, avatars are unequivocally other. Both limited and freed by difference from the player, they can accom- plish more than the player alone; they are supernatural ambassadors of agency [106].  Both authors here suggest a relationship between user and avatar that is ﬁlled with tension: the avatar is part of the user but at the same time remains sep- arate,  and  the  user  makes  decisions  as  to  the  nature  of  the  avatar  but  the avatar also exists independent from the user  statically, frozen until the user returns to the game . Marie Ryan also recognizes this tension, but suggests that the user has control over how she relates to her avatar: “Will she be like an actor playing a role, innerly distanciated from her character and simulat- ing emotions she does not really have, or will she experience her character in ﬁrst-person mode, actually feeling [the emotions] that motivate the charac- ter’s behavior or that may result from her actions?”  6 . Wilson’s deﬁnition of avatar privileges user choice, and Ryan’s question here suggests that the user has complete conscious control over her relationship with her avatar. But when I read about Murray’s experience playing Mad Dog McCree, or when I read Berger’s comparison of videogames to an addictive drug, I am forced to wonder again about the nature of the user avatar relationship and exactly how much choice the user has in this relationship. In an interview conducted by Celia Pearce, longtime LucasArts game designer Tim Schafer suggested that even as users may have complete control over their avatars in the early stages of a videogame, this relationship may change as the game play continues. In the beginning, he says, games “have to provide the character with motiva- tion and you have to provide the player with motivation. Because the char- acter will care about things that the player will not necessarily care about”  1 . As game play progresses, Schafer hypothesizes that users begin to “ego- invest,  they  share  the  motivations  of  the  character”   9 .  This  notion  of  “ego-investing” is a complicated one and does indeed imply a reciprocal rela- tionship between user and avatar.  Role-Playing Games  The  concepts  of  ego-investing  in  an  avatar  and  of  seeing  avatars  as ambassadors of agency, provoking self-confrontation are interesting ones. It seems to me that these concepts, used by different theorists to try to explain   12  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  the relationship between a user and her videogame avatar, are all related to one  important  concept:  identity.  How  is  human  identity  formed?  Can videogame play impact identity formation? These are complex questions, as much research in identity theory and videogame theory can attest to. I will discuss this research in the next chapter. For now, I want to return my focus to avatars, since so many theorists agree that they are crucial to immersive videogame play. In distinguishing between agents and avatars earlier in this chapter, I eliminated most videogame genres from having true avatars, since most playable videogame agents are not customizable by the user. And so the question remains: which videogame genres have true avatars and provide the best opportunities for users to identify with them?  To begin to answer this question, I return to Murray’s Hamlet and the Holodeck  1997  to highlight her prophetic talents. In this text, Murray made several  speculative  statements  about  how  videogames  in  the  future  would best immerse users and impact them emotionally. Murray’s predictions for immersive and emotionally evocative videogames dealt with several differ- ent aspects of videogame play. I share all of her prophetic statements here and then discuss their signiﬁcance and relationship to the current status of avatars and videogame play. To sustain compelling storytelling in an inter- active medium like videogames, Murray was convinced that the key was “to invent scripts that are formulaic enough to be easily grasped and responded to  but  ﬂexible  enough  to  capture  a  wide  range  of  human  behavior”   79 . Regarding immersive game worlds, she envisioned the ideal spatial naviga- tion:  The potential of the labyrinth would seem to lie somewhere between the single-path maze adventure and the underdetermined form of the rhizome, in stories that are goal driven enough to guide navigation but open-ended enough to allow free exploration and that display a satis- fying dramatic structure no matter how the interactor chooses to tra- verse the space [135].  For Murray, the key to immersive videogames lay in impacting the user emo- tionally: “We need to ﬁnd ways of drawing a player so deeply into the situ- ated point of view of a character that a change of position will raise important moral questions”  147 . At the end of her text, Murray ﬁnally revealed the type of videogame genre she felt would best meet all these criteria as she dis- cussed the virtual world of future videogames:  Lushly realized places will turn from spectacle experiences to dramatic stages. We will move from the pleasures of immersion and navigational agency  to  increasingly  active  and  transformational  experiences.... Unlike  a  videogame, a role-playing world [emphasis  mine]  should allow each interactor to choose from several ways to go about the task,   1. Videogames, Avatars, and Identity  13  including bartering as well as ﬁghting.... The private pleasures of the digital environment are likely to continue to attract us. Solo play would allow the interactor to explore all the stories within the limits of the world and to play all the parts until they had exhausted all the possi- bilities  of  personal  imaginative  engagement  within  a  nostalgically charged situation. As a domain in which we can actively participate in a  responsive  environment, without consequence in the real world [emphasis mine], the desktop story world may engage our most com- pelling transformational fantasies [264, 268, 270–71].  All of Murray’s predictions have come true, and all of her suggestions have been realized in a particular genre of videogame. Not coincidentally, this is the same genre that allows users to construct true avatars: the video role-play- ing game  V–RPG .  The History of Role-Playing Games  Of  course,  V–RPGs  owe  their  origins  to  table-top  roleplaying  games. Dungeons & Dragons  1974 , created by Gary Gygax, was the ﬁrst published table-top RPG. Eddie Dombrower provides a simple beginning deﬁnition for role-playing games, whether they be table-top or video: “The player assumes a persona that changes over time. The persona is assigned a range of physi- cal and other attributes that change over time. These attributes also change as a result of the user’s actions. The art of playing RPGs lies in mastering  the complex relationships”  31  between the avatar and any given game sit- uation.  Gygax  set  Dungeons  &  Dragons   D  &  D   in  a  vast  fantasy  world inspired in part by J. R. R. Tolkien’s Middle Earth, replete with magic and mythical creatures. Table-top RPGs need one person to perform the role of “dungeon master,” who narrates the unfolding story for each individual gam- ing session, answers the players’ questions about the gameworld, and takes on  the  role  of  any  non-player  characters5  NPCs   that  were  encountered  during  the  session. D  &  D was  enormously  popular,  and  many  additional table-top RPGs set in many additional fantastical worlds were quickly pro- duced.6 Table-top RPGs were epic open-ended affairs, with vast game worlds that could be expanded via the whims of dungeon masters’ imaginations and endless adventuring and questing for the players’ avatars. It didn’t take long before techno-enthusiasts began to try to replicate the RPG experience vir- tually,  and  in  1975  several  text-based  V–RPGs  came  out  for  the  PLATO7 system. In 1980, Richard Garriott created Akalabeth, a graphical RPG that used vectoring lines much in the same way Battlezone did. Garriott’s Ultima series, among the most successful V–RPGs of all time, was based on Akala- beth.  The  ﬁrst  V–RPG for  a  console  system  was  created  in  1982,  when   14  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Treasure of Tarmin debuted for the Intellivi- sion. In 2007,  V–RPGs remain among the most popular video games, with MMORPGs  such  as  Everquest,  Ultima  Online,  and World  of  Warcraft each having hundreds of thousands of subscribers. However, single-player V–RPGs have been popular as well, with games such as Final Fantasy X, Baldur’s Gate, Knights of the Old Republic, Morrowind, Oblivion, and Mass Effect all boast- ing strong sales and critical acclaim in recent years. With the continual devel- opment of computer technology, each new generation of V–RPG is now able to provide an arguably more immersive experience than table-top RPGs in all  of  the  deﬁning  characteristics  of  the  genre:  a  creative  dungeon  master  now  “performed”  by  elaborate  computer  software ,  NPC  interaction,  a responsive, detailed environment, quantiﬁed assessment and evolution of the avatar’s abilities, and a map of the game environment  Mackay 23–24 . All of the V–RPGs mentioned here meet Murray’s predictive criteria for immer- sive and emotionally meaningful videogames with open-ended game worlds and stories and most importantly for the purposes of this project, with cus- tomizable avatars. Indeed, it is the relationship between the user and their avatar that I explore to examine what identity connections exist. However, in order to study the relationships between the identity of the user and the identity of the avatar, a clear terminological framework is needed. For that framework,  I  turn  to  the  writings  of  noted  videogame  scholar  James  Paul Gee.  Gee’s Virtual, Real-World, and Projective Identities  In What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy and Why Video Games are Good for Your Soul, Gee argues that in V–RPGs, three different distinct identities are involved. The ﬁrst of these is a virtual iden- tity: the avatar that exists in the ﬁctionalized virtual gameworld. Gee pro- vides the example of the half-elf named “Bead Bead” he created for the V–RPG Arcanum. The second type Gee calls real-world identity. For Gee, this is the “real-world character”  What Video Games 55  that sits down in front of a computer and plays the game. James Gee is a real-world identity: Gee has a physical body that exists  much of the time in Tempe, Arizona . However, Gee points out that each of us have many different “nonvirtual identities” at all times, identifying himself as a “professor, a linguist, an Anglo American, a middle-age male baby boomer, a parent, an avid reader, a former devout Catholic”  55  and so on. These multiple aspects of our identities are accessed by us as necessary as we encounter and react to life stimuli. Given Gee’s notion of multiple identities, how does he characterize the interactions between his real-world  identity   James  Gee   and  his  virtual  identity   Bead  Bead ?  Gee   1. Videogames, Avatars, and Identity  15  describes Bead Bead as a “delicious blend of my doing and not my doing”  54–55  and to explain this he creates his third type of identity, projective identity, which he describes as:  The kind of person I want Bead Bead to be, the kind of history I want her to have, the kind of person and history I am trying to build in and through her is what I mean by a projective identity. Since these aspi- rations  are  my  desires  for  Bead  Bead,  the  projective  identity  is  both mine and hers, and it is a space in which I can transcend both her lim- itations and my own.... In this identity, the stress is on the interface between — the  interactions  between — the  real-world  person  and  the virtual character [56].  Gee’s projective identity then is the middle ground between the real-world identity and the virtual identity of the user: the avatar. Like Gee, I too am interested in the relationship between the real-world identity of the user, the virtual  identity  of  the  avatar,  and  the  connections  and  tensions  that  exist between these two types of identity.  Even though he never uses the word itself, Gee’s description of projec- tive identity as the bridge between the real-world and virtual identities sug- gests that he sees the projective identity as liminal space. Liminality, from the Latin word meaning “threshold,” was used by Van Gennep in 1908 as part of his three step sequence describing rites of passage: separation, liminality, and reincorporation.  Liminality,  the  middle  stage,  was  the  phase  where  one belonged to both and neither of the other two phases: a phase of transition during which normal limits to self understanding are relaxed thus opening the way to something new. Seeing Gee’s projective identity as a type of lim- inality clariﬁes the ways other videogame scholars also consider the relation- ship  between  user  and  avatar  as  intriguing  yet  problematic  space.  Rehak discusses avatars and liminality in the following manner:  Movement back and forth across the border separating self from other might therefore be considered a kind of liminal play. We create avatars to leave our bodies behind, yet take the body with us in the form of codes and assumptions about what does and does not constitute a legit- imate  interface  with  reality — virtual  or  otherwise....  The  worlds  we create — and the avatarial bodies through which we experience them — seem  destined  to  mirror  not  our  wholeness,  but  our  lack  of  it  [123, 124].  Flynn deﬁnes a liminal experience in gaming as a “moment of heightened pleasure as the player is brieﬂy suspended between one realm of experience and another”  2 . Both of these theoretical descriptions seem consistent with Gee’s explanation of projective identity. Even Murray spoke of liminal objects, “located on the threshold between external reality and our own minds”  99 .   16  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  She described this balancing act: “In order to sustain such powerful immer- sive trances we have to do something inherently paradoxical: we have to keep the virtual world ‘real’ by keeping it ‘not there.’ We have to keep it balanced squarely on the enchanted threshold without letting it collapse onto either side”  100 . All of these scholars, Gee included, seem convinced that the lim- inal, threshold space between the user and the videogame avatar is crucial to any identity formation that occurs as the result of V–RPG play. But is there reason to believe that such identity formation is actually occurring? Is there evidence to suggest that the real-world identities of V–RPG users are impacted in meaningful ways by their virtual identities? To ﬁnd out, I turned my atten- tion to two V–RPGs that I knew had large fan bases devoted to them, and in which I had personally felt strong connections to my own avatars: The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.8  Identity in Elderscrolls.com’s Morrowind and   Oblivion Forums  Both games are set in the Elder Scrolls fantasy universe9 and are single- player V–RPGs. Morrowind was originally released in 2002 for PCs and the Xbox console system; Oblivion came out in 2006 for PCs and the Xbox 360. Both V–RPGs topped many video game critics’ “Game of the Year” lists and remain popular today.10 This popularity is evidenced by the large number of postings in the Morrowind and Oblivion forums11 at Elderscrolls.com, a com- prehensive website devoted to the Elder Scrolls universe depicted in Bethesda Software’s  games.  It  was  to  these  avid Morrowind and  Oblivion gamers  in  the Elderscrolls.com forums that I turned to begin my examination of just how closely connected users believed their real-world identities were to their virtual identities. Joining the Morrowind forum, I posted the following entry:  Is your Morrowind identity any less “real” than your real-world iden- tity? If many of us are logging hundreds of hours with our Morrowind avatars  a virtual identity , what impact does this have on our “real” identity?  In  other  words,  does  the  time  spent  in  Morrowind carry over impact when you leave that virtual setting? I’m interested in hear- ing  how  you  see  your  identities   real,  virtual,  and  the  intersection between these two  being impacted inﬂuenced by Morrowind. Do you ﬁnd your virtual Morrowind identity to be as “real” in some ways as your non-virtual identity? How does one inform the other?  I also posted a similar question in the Oblivion forum. The replies I received to these questions were fascinating as they highlighted what appeared to be a signiﬁcant, dynamic, yet poorly understood relationship between the users’ real-life identities and their virtual identities. Dante Nerevar wrote:   1. Videogames, Avatars, and Identity  17  In many ways I look at my character as me, except for the fact that my skin is not grey. I look at it like this: there are two of me, Nick [real- world identity] and Dante [virtual identity]. When not playing Mor- rowind I am Nick, but when I am I’m a completely different person. When I get lost in a virtual reality it is a good thing. Regardless, some of my characteristics inﬂuence Dante’s and his inﬂuence mine [1].  Here, the user seems to contradict himself, at ﬁrst stating that his two iden- tities  were  “completely  different”  but  later  admitting  to  mutual  inﬂuence between the two. Toastman shows a similar contradiction when he discusses the separation between his real-world identity and his Morrowind avatars:  For me, playing a character in a game is like playing a character in a play or movie. I love getting completely absorbed in a new identity, discovering  how  he  reacts  that  is  different  from  my  reactions.  I  do things in character that I would never, ever think of doing in real life, [but] for some of my characters I make decisions based on my own values. While the [avatars] are fun to play, they’re not me. Sure, maybe they represent subconscious aspects of my personality, but while I may act somewhat differently when I’m with family, or friends, or cowork- ers, I’m still essentially the same. Any differences are mostly superﬁcial. Even though my own identity can change depending on who I’m with, my Morrowind identities are less real to me than my own identity. I know that when the lights go down on the stage, or when I power down my computer, that I will be myself again [1].  Toastman is willing to admit that his real-world identity is constantly shift- ing given different stimuli, but isn’t willing to concede that his virtual iden- tity   which  also  evolves  thanks  to  Toastman’s  reactions  to  stimuli   is  as signiﬁcant  as  his  real-world  identity.  His  last  phrase  is  provocative:  if  he wasn’t  himself  during  his Morrowind gameplay,  then  who  was  he?  Did  his avatar have a life of its own? Toastman seems unwilling to concede that the relationship between himself and his avatar might be substantial in any way. Another gamer, Anais, chooses to distance herself from her avatar. In writ- ing about her favorite Oblivion avatar, she says, “I ﬁnd that with my most played  Bosmer  [an  elf ]  we  often  have  disagreements.  She  has  solutions  to problems that wouldn’t occur to me. I also have to respect her wishes”  1 . Here, she seems to suggest that her Bosmer virtual identity comes up with solutions to problems without any input from Anais’ real-world identity. Of course, this is impossible, since the Morrowind avatar takes no actions that are not explicitly triggered by the user. These users all seem to be in denial about the connections between themselves and their avatars.  Other Morrowind and Oblivion gamers seemed much more comfortable acknowledging the reciprocal relationship between their real-world identity and their virtual identity via their avatar. Syronj wrote, “Shaka [the avatar]   18  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  is an idealized version of what I would look up to in a character: brave and unselﬁsh, whenever possible. I found that I’m not good at playing evil char- acters in the game. At the same time, I sometimes think the game has made me more likely to take a chance in real life”  1 . Syronj credits her virtual expe- rience in Morrowind with making her real-world identity braver. Danile also readily admits that her avatars are:  Mainly how I would like to be in real life. Tough, and not taking any put downs or anything from anyone. But, like me, they are caring and do not hurt anyone if they do not have to. One of my current charac- ters  likes  to  go  pearl  diving  and  all  the  pearls  he  gets  he  sells  to  get money for widows and orphans. It’s beyond me to be evil [1].  I can’t help but notice in Danile’s posting how she seems to unconsciously move from the avatar  “he”  to herself  “me” . This was a common phenom- enon in many gamers’ postings. James Gee himself demonstrated a similar connection to his Morrowind avatar Bead when recounting the shame he felt when Bead disrobed at the request of an NPC to obtain information. Gee con- fesses that he ended up killing that NPC out of rage and shame shortly there- after.  He  also  admits  to  having  guilt  over  killing  a  guard  while  stealing  a weapon out of a museum: “We felt guilty about this murder to the end. Many times we wished we had re-played that part of the game to clear our record”  Why Video Games 94 . Note Gee’s usage of “we” and “our” in this statement; this usage reﬂects the ﬁrst person plurality of his videogame identity. Bobg seems  to  share  Danile’s  identiﬁcation  with  her  avatar,  saying  that  he  does “feel what my [Oblivion] characters must be feeling given the person they are and their situation in the game. I try to play according to their world view”  1 . Another user blames his virtual world struggles with addiction on his real- world identity’s similar problems, as he admits to having logged over 1,000 hours playing Morrowind in a post that reminds me of Berger’s statement at the start of this chapter. The vrrc writes, “I have spent entire days doing noth- ing but playing Morrowind. Quite literally 18 hours a day, sometimes for sev- eral days in a row. I have a very addictive personality ... which is also why I can’t stay off the skooma”12  1 .  The  presence  of  a  liminal  projective  identity  between  real-world  and virtual identities was perhaps best articulated in these forums by the users named doctor44 and Bloom. Doctor44 acknowledges that his Oblivion avatars are really “expressions of myself. They express the darker sides of my per- sonality  that  are  inappropriate  to  express  in  the  real  world — it’s  a  way  to keep myself in balance in a safe and secure manner”  1 . In describing his current Morrowind avatar Boris Karl, Bloom writes:  It is amazing to me that Boris Karl is not even a level 5 character,13 yet has  walked  around  the  entire  circumference  of  Vvardenfell.  He  has   1. Videogames, Avatars, and Identity  19  been killed several times, but never has he been all that interested in leveling up. It’s not in his nature. When Boris encounters something that interests Bloom, the two have a tendency to overlap, although I try to resist that ... I think the middle ground between them  Boris and Bloom  is the arena of exploration and discovery. It is why I love the game as much as I do [1].  Other  gamers  expressed  a  similar  and  somewhat  inexplicable  fondness  for their avatars. Cobb ruminated in the following manner about his Oblivion avatar: “I’ve stuck with the same character right through Oblivion —all 1000+ hours! She certainly isn’t a ‘perfect’ character, in fact she’s bloody useless— especially once mountain lions start appearing. I dunno, though, she’s kind of grown on me even though I’m not sure what I was aiming for in the char- acter creation stage. I’ve gotten so used to having her around”  1 . Cobb’s attachment to his female avatar is interesting indeed. Bloom and Cobb aren’t alone in deriving pleasure from their Elder Scrolls videogame experiences as the following quote from Ice Troll illustrates: “Some consider Morrowind to be better than sex. I think they are exaggerating a bit, but it’s pretty close”  1 . Ice Troll’s comment may well be tongue-in-cheek, but Bloom seems to believe that Boris and Bloom are both the same and different, joined and sep- arate,  that  Boris  has  his  own  “nature”  just  as  Bloom  does.  This  tension between being not being takes place in liminal space via Gee’s projective iden- tity as these replies from die-hard gamers strongly suggest.  Other postings in the Morrowind and Oblivion forums also suggest that the  journey  between  real-world  identity  and  virtual  identity  is  not  always instantaneous: it may take time for some gamers to complete the passage out of their virtual identity. One topical thread contained in both forums illus- trated this clearly. It was entitled “You know you’ve played too much Mor- rowind Oblivion when....”  Each  user  was  invited  to  share  an  example  that completed  this  sentence.  Brayf  provided  the  following  response:  “When somebody walks into the room while you’re playing, and you try to turn and look at them by moving the mouse”  1 . Padalin made the following confes- sion: “When you’re mad with a friend and you say ‘khajiit has no words for you’14 and that actually happened to me whether you believe me or not”  1 . Farterman suggested that “you know you have been playing too much when in REAL life you think of doing something bad that might affect you, and you  ask  yourself,  ‘Maybe  I  should  save  before  I  do  this’”   1 .  Lonesniper admits  to  having  real-world  nightmares  based  on  Morrowind:  “When  you have  dreams  about  Corprus  monsters15 attacking  you  in  the  real  world. Guilty”   1 .  Toastman  posted  the  following  response  to  this  topic  thread: “When this happens to you: I was doing the Sanctus Shrine Tempe Quest16 and my housemate came into my room and asked me a question. It took me   20  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  a few seconds to realize that I could actually talk to him without messing up the pilgrimage”  1 . Toastman apparently needed a few seconds to move from his virtual identity to his real-world identity.  All  of  these  postings  seem  to  suggest  that  the  virtual  experiences  the users had in Morrowind and Oblivion via their avatars were carrying over into their real-world experiences in certain ways, but exactly how was this hap- pening? And to what extent does the level of immersive identiﬁcation with the avatar and gaming world in question dictate the time needed to transi- tion out of a virtual identity? This preliminary examination of Morrowind and Oblivion gamers using Gee’s terminological identity construct led me to some  very  interesting  questions  indeed:  How  do  the  virtual  identities  of avatars in V–RPGs get constructed? Using Morrowind, Oblivion, and Fallout 3 as  representative  examples,  what  is  the  relationship  between  real-world identity, virtual identity, and projective identity in video role-playing games? Before  examining  data  collected  speciﬁcally  from  players  of  these  three V–RPGs I need to ﬁrst provide an overview of the theoretical ﬁelds relevant to these questions. I turn now in chapter two to a closer examination of the- oretical work related to identity, videogames, genre, and narrativity.   Locating Identity in  New Media Theory  Conscious agency is the essence of human identity. Sacriﬁce this, and we humans are hopelessly compromised, contaminated with mechanic ali- enness in the very heart of our humanity.  — Katherine Hayles, technology theorist, 1999  I no longer believe in a single reality, a single integrating view of the world, or even the reliability of a single angle of perception.  — Janet Murray, narrative theorist, 1997  Role-playing  games  can  serve  in  [an]  evocative  capacity  because  they stand betwixt and between the unreal and the real; they are a game and something more.  — Sherry Turkle, technology theorist, 1995  To begin to understand the relationship between Gee’s tripartite notions of identity  real-world, virtual, and projective  in video role-playing games several different themes need to be explored. In this chapter I ﬁrst examine modern and postmodern theories of identity as identity formation is the main focus of this study. Next I trace important concepts and terms from videogame theory,  as  several  technological  aspects  of  this  entertainment  medium  are essential to its immersive potential. Narrative theory is also discussed: nar- ratives and stories are powerful instruments of meaning-making, both in the formation of personal identity and in v–RPGs. Finally, I discuss the impor- tance of genre theory, as the fantasy role-playing videogame has at least three distinct generic levels  fantasy, role-playing game, and videogame . Each of these four major theoretical areas  identity theory, video game rhetoric, nar- rativity, and genre theory  make essential contributions to my examination of the identity formation that occurs between users and their avatars in video role-playing games.  2  21   22  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  Identity: Modernist Theories  It is essential to ﬁrst explore the theoretical concept of “identity.” What is identity? How is it formed? The answers to these questions continue to be much  debated  by  scholars  across  disciplines.  Most  would  agree  that  one’s identity  or identities  is part of one’s “self,” but Jan Klein’s scientiﬁc deﬁni- tion of “self ” shows just how problematic this is: “[Self is] everything con- stituting an integral part of a given individual”  5 . Rhetorically, it is easy to see this deﬁnition is open to much interpretation. For example, what consti- tutes an “integral” part for a given individual? Who gets to make that deci- sion:  the  individual  or  the  society  around  that  individual?  Much  of  the theoretical conversation revolving around identity is concerned with this very issue,  with  modernist  and  postmodernist  perspectives  central  to  the  argu- ment.  One  of  modernism’s  deﬁning  characteristics  is  the  heavy  emphasis  it places on the individual. Alberto Melucci succinctly summarizes this view: “The most exalting and dramatic legacy of modernity [is] our need and duty to exist as individuals. Modern individuals think of themselves as subjects of action capable of purposive and meaningful behavior”  61 . In similar fash- ion, Lester Faigley describes how modernism’s notion of the individual is a “coherent  consciousness  capable  of  knowing  oneself  and  the  world”   16 . With this concept at its core, Anthony Giddens’ Modernity and Self-Identity is a pivotal modernist treatise on identity and identity construction. For Gid- dens, self-identity is connected to self-awareness:  Existence is a mode of being-in-the-world. In doing everyday life, all human beings answer the question of being; they do it by the nature of  the  activities  they  carry  out....  The  identity  of  the  self  presumes reﬂexive  awareness.  It  is  what  the  individual  is  conscious  of  in  the  term self-consciousness. Self-identity has to be routinely created and sustained  in  the  reﬂexive  activities  of  the  individual....  Self-identity  is  not  a  distinctive  trait,  or  even  a  collection  of  traits,  possessed  by  the individual. It is the self as reﬂexively understood by the person in terms  of  her  or  his  biography  [presuming]  continuity  across  time  and space.... A person’s identity is not to be found in behavior nor in the reactions of others, but in the capacity to keep a particular narra- tive  going.  The  individual’s  biography,  if  she  is  to  maintain  regular interaction  with  others  in  the  day-to-day  world,  cannot  be  wholly ﬁctive. It must continually integrate events which occur in the exter- nal world and sort them into the ongoing story about the self [52, 53, 54].  Giddens reveals some interesting assumptions about identity in this passage. It seems clear that he believes in a single self-identity rather than multiple   2. Locating Identity in New Media Theory  23  self-identities for an individual. This identity is determined by a person’s life narrative  again singular  that is created through the individual’s self-aware- ness. In other words, each person becomes aware of their own identity by con- structing a narrative about themselves: who they are and what they have done. Each new action the person takes must be able to be integrated with the iden- tity they have already created in their life narrative  with change possible over time . He also suggests here that neither the person’s actions nor the outside perceptions of those actions by other people greatly impact identity: the nar- rative within the individual’s mind  and that individual’s own awareness of the narrative  determines identity. Giddens’ view here is very much in keep- ing with modernism’s privileging of the individual and the sovereignty of the individual mind. He also makes many assumptions about the nature of sto- ries and narrative theory which do not do justice to the complexity of nar- rativity.1  Giddens also stresses the importance of the body and embodiment to  self identity:  The self, of course, is embodied. To learn to become a competent agent is to be able to exert a continuous, and successful, monitoring of face and body.... Regularized control of the body is a fundamental means whereby a biography of self-identity is maintained.... The body and its practical immersion in the interactions of day-to-day life is an essen- tial part of the sustaining of a coherent sense of self-identity [56, 57, 99].  For Giddens, embodiment is crucial to self-identity, even as his earlier quote suggested  that  the  story  of  one’s  life  that  created  identity  exists  in  mental self-awareness. Giddens’ modernist view on identity is complex in this regard. He suggests that the body’s “immersion” in daily activities  external stimuli  is essential to sustaining self-identity, as the mind then processes and reﬂects on these external stimuli to create a coherent internal narrative. It is inter- esting  to  note  here  that  Giddens  also  warns  of  the  potential  dangers  of  creating  a  disembodied  false  self  “in  which  the  body  appears  as  an  object  or instrument manipulated by the self from behind the scenes.... The disem- bodied  person  may  feel  unimplicated  in  bodily  desire,  and  experiences  dangers as though they were threats to another person. When this dissocia- tion happens as an unwanted feature of personality it expresses existential anxieties  impinging  directly  upon  self-identity”   59 .  Implicit  here  is  the binary between true false, another marker of modernity. I have found no evi- dence to suggest that Giddens ever studied videogames or considered them in constructing his theories of identity. Nevertheless, it is interesting to con- sider  the  relationship  between  users  and  their  avatars  in  light  of  Giddens’ ideas  of  disembodied  notions  of  self.  Later  in  this  chapter  I  will  examine   24  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  whether or not videogame scholars consider the role-playing that takes place in v–RPGs as a dangerous, disembodiment of self-identity as Giddens likely would.  One of the biggest distinctions between modern and postmodern con- ceptions of identity is the debate over whether or not the self is unitary or multiple. Giddens articulates the modern view well as he critiques the post- modern notion of a fragmented concept of self-identity: “Some authors sup- pose that the self essentially becomes broken up — that individuals tend to develop multiple selves in which there is no inner core of self-identity. This is plainly not the case. The maintaining of constants of demeanor across vary- ing settings of interaction is one of the prime means whereby coherence of self-identity is ordinarily preserved”  100 . Yet later Giddens admits that this core is continually shifting: “A self-identity has to be created and more or less  continually  reordered  against  the  backdrop  of  shifting  experiences  of day-to-day life and the fragmenting tendencies of modern institutions”  186 . Even as Giddens is referring here to what he believes to be a stable self, this “reordered and shifting” identity suggests a multiplicity of identity in keep- ing with much postmodern theory.  Identity: Postmodernist Theories  Postmodern identity theorists privilege the “shifting experiences of day- to-day life” in postulating that individual identity is actually individual iden- tities, fragmented and multiple. Whereas Giddens sees a core identity, many postmodern  theorists  question  the  very  notion  of  a  core  at  all.  Feminist scholar Diana Fuss characterizes the postmodern view as she points out that identity  is  a  disputed  and  unstable  theoretical  concept:  “Identity  is  rarely identical to itself but instead has multiple and sometimes contradictory mean- ings ... [what is needed is] recognition of the precarious status of identity and a full awareness of the complicated processes of identity formation, both psy- chical and social”  98, 99 . It seems clear that Fuss believes that both inter- nal  psychical  and external  social  stimuli contribute to the multiplicity of identities  within  individuals.  She  goes  on  to  say  that  her  “own  position endorse[s] identity as alienated and ﬁctitious.... To the extent that identity always contains the specter of non-identity within it, the subject is always divided.... Fictions of identity are no less powerful for being ﬁctions. It is not so much that we possess contingent identities but that identity itself is con- tingent”  102–104 . The last sentence of this statement demonstrates that Fuss does not believe in any “core” identity but rather always shifting, contextual identities with none having any lasting primacy over the others. The notion of identity being closely associated with non-identity is also an important con-   2. Locating Identity in New Media Theory  25  cept. To more fully explain this connection I return brieﬂy to modernism and Kenneth Burke’s concept of identiﬁcation.  Identiﬁcation  Burke  was  ﬁrmly  situated  in  modernism,  but  his  views  on  human identiﬁcation  remain  relevant  to  modern  and  postmodern  theorists  alike  and  are  crucial  to  understanding  identity.  For  Burke,  identiﬁcation  was  a consubstantiation of merger and division: “In being identiﬁed with B, A is ‘substantially one’ with a person other than himself. Yet at the same time he remains unique, an individual locus of motives. Thus he is both joined and separate,  at  once  a  distinct  substance  and  consubstantial  with  another”  20–21 .  Every  day,  people  identify  the  stimuli  they  encounter  as  similar  to  themselves   merger   or  dissimilar  to  themselves   division .  Both  are identiﬁcations,  however,  since  as  humans  we  are  only  ever  able  to  deﬁne  ourselves  what we are  in relation to what we are not anyway. Burke refers to this as the paradox of substance: a man is deﬁned in relationship to not- man  woman ; life is deﬁned in relationship to not-life  death , and so on. Burke  believed  the  transformation  that  occurred  between  life  and  death  was one of the most important types of identiﬁcation imaginable. Indeed,  all  identiﬁcations  had  the  potential  to  be  substantially  transformative  for Burke, whether the identiﬁcation was merger or division. The inﬂuences of Burke’s modern notions of transformation and identiﬁcation can be found in the decidedly postmodern views of many videogame scholars, including Rehak,  who  explains  just  how  crucial  the  transformation  between  life  and death  are  to  avatarial  identiﬁcation:  “Avatars  differ  from  us  through  their ability to live, die, and live again.... The simulated experience of death and resurrection is a key function of the avatar.... Systematic rupture of the agen- tial and identiﬁcatory linkage between players and avatars is a deﬁning char- acteristic.... Players derive pleasure from avatarial instability”  107, 114, 110, 123 .  Rehak  clearly  believes  that  users  identify  with  their  avatars  through both merger  creating and controlling the appearance and skills of the avatar  and  division   being  forced  to  reload  an  earlier  saved  game  point  when  the  avatar  dies,  for  example .  Gee  also  echoes  Burkean  identiﬁcation  by  stating that videogame “pleasure is a play between sameness and difference, a play between simplicity and complexity”  Why Video Games 13 . For Gee, the  tensions  between  being  and  not-being  become  pleasurable  in  video- games.  Fuss also explores the notion of identiﬁcation in relation to identity but takes  a  different  approach  from  Burke.  She  distinguishes  between  identity and identiﬁcation in the following way:   26  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  We tend to experience our identities as part of our public personas, the most exposed part of our self ’s surface collisions with a world of other selves— we  experience  our  identiﬁcations  as  more  private,  guarded, evasive ... every identity is actually an identiﬁcation come to light.... Identity is the Self that identiﬁes itself. Identiﬁcation is the psychical mechanism that produces self-recognition ... the detour through the other that deﬁnes a self [2].  Identiﬁcation then for Fuss is the more personal, internal self-awareness that precedes and leads to the more public identities of individuals. This identi- ﬁcation seems similar to Giddens’ reﬂexive self-awareness in some respects, but  Giddens  would  likely  never  agree  that  this  self-awareness  ever  travels through an “other” to construct self-identity. Fuss’ observation raises an inter- esting question when applied to a v–RPG avatar: can the user’s avatar become this “other” through which the user produces self-recognition?  Fuss also resonates with Burke’s paradox of substance when she discusses the concept of disidentiﬁcation: an individual’s willful choice to experience division rather than merger  to use Burke’s terms . However, Fuss astutely points out that disidentiﬁcation “may actually represent an identiﬁcation that one  fears  to  make  only  because  one  has  already  made  it”   7 .  Murray’s conﬂicted  revelation  about  her  dual  role  as  paciﬁst  mother  and  Mad  Dog McCree gunslinger  comes  to  mind  as  an  example  of  the  tenuous  division between identiﬁcation and disidentiﬁcation. Fuss  drawing on Rey Chow’s Writing Diaspora  also discusses identiﬁcation as a “violent negation,” point- ing out that our identiﬁcations with cultural others are often “violent fan- tasies of displacement—fantasy idealizations that enact imaginary usurpations ... identiﬁcation operates on one level as an endless process of violent nega- tion, a process of killing off the other in fantasy in order to usurp the other’s place, the place where the subject desires to be”  8–9 . Here too we see echoes of Burkean transformation tied to life and death. Fuss also argues, contrary to Freud’s psychoanalytical view, that identiﬁcation  in Freudian language, the wish to be the other  and desire  the wish to have the other  are “funda- mentally indissociable”  12 : identiﬁcation and desire for Fuss cannot be extri- cated from each other.  Other postmodern theorists see identity in still different ways. Filiciak acknowledges the inﬂuence of postmodernism in his deﬁnition of identity, calling  it  “cogitation  on  how  to  deﬁne  our  ‘self ’  under  postmodern  living conditions”   88 .  Of  course,  as  we  know  from  Hayles’  earlier  observation, “self ” is an equally problematic concept. Filiciak goes on to describe “con- ventionally  understood  human  identity”  as  being  a  “constancy  of  physical  and  mental  traits  that  allow  us  to  differentiate  our  self  from  others”   93 .  He points out that in the past  before the industrial revolution , people had   2. Locating Identity in New Media Theory  27  little  opportunity  to  change  social  class  and,  therefore,  social  interactions, their  residence,  or  type  of  work.  Since  the  industrial  revolution  this  has changed dramatically, Filiciak argues, thus increasing the number of social identities individuals now take on. Drawing on William James, Filiciak sug- gests that identity is determined only in reference to others. This idea res- onates  with  Burke’s  paradox  of  substance  and  merger  and  division:  self identities created in relationship to external stimuli that we identify as sim- ilar or different.  Feminist technology theorist Donna Haraway also critiques modernism’s notions  of  self  and  identity.  Despite  her  theoretical  differences  from  Fuss, Butler, and other feminist postmodern theorists, Haraway sees the modernist, Western notion of self as inaccurate: “[The] concept of a coherent inner self, achieved  or  innate,  is  a  regulatory  ﬁction  that  is  unnecessary....  Identities seem contradictory, partial, and strategic”  135, 155 . Haraway uses the term “splitting” to describe the contradictory nature of self-identities:  Splitting should be about heterogeneous multiplicities that are simul- taneously necessary and incapable of being squashed into isomorphic slots or cumulative lists. The knowing self is partial in all its guises, never ﬁnished, whole, simply there and original; it is always constructed and  stitched  together  imperfectly,  and  therefore  able  to  join  with another, to see together without claiming to be another [193].  Haraway  describes  self-identity  as  consisting  of  many  distinct  and  unique parts  division  that nevertheless share enough  merger  to be able to join together. She stresses the importance of these different aspects of the self being able to “see” each other as crucial to the creation of self-identity, making the concept of vision central to this theory:  Being is problematic and contingent. One cannot relocate in any pos- sible  vantage  point  without  being  accountable  for  that  movement. Vision is always a question of the power to see. We are not immedi- ately present to ourselves. Self-knowledge requires a semiotic-mate- rial  technology  linking  meanings  and  bodies....  Vision  requires instruments of vision. Instruments of vision mediate standpoints. Posi- tioning is, therefore, the key practice grounding knowledge organized around the imagery of vision [192, 193].  Haraway’s stance on vision here illuminates what seems to be a major prob- lem: how to effectively switch vantage points to allow for alternative view- ings to aid in self-identity? In other words, how can we position ourselves to see ourselves so that we might reﬂect on ourselves? I believe videogame the- ory related to avatars  which are typically offered in both ﬁrst- and third- person points of view  can begin to provide answers to these questions and I will return to the issue later in this chapter.   28  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  Identity and Performance  Several  postmodern  theorists  stress  a  performative  aspect  to  identity. Among the most well-known of these is Judith Butler whose theory of per- formativity continues to inﬂuence many postmodern scholars. Butler focuses on gender, describing it as a repeated performance that produces the social belief in both a core gender and a distinction between interior and exterior. Butler stresses that both of these commonly held assumptions are ﬁctions, that there is no core identity or any distinct demarcation between interior and exterior. In her own words:  Persons only become intelligible through becoming gendered in con- formity with recognizable standards of gender intelligibility. To what extent is “identity” a normative ideal rather than a descriptive feature of experience? The “coherence” and “continuity” of “the person” are not logical or analytic features of personhood, but, rather, socially insti- tuted and maintained norms of intelligibility [16–17].  Performance  which can contain a mixture of language and bodily aspects  then could alter meaning in both internal and external ways. Butler seems comfortable theorizing language from both a Cartesian  language is under- stood through the mind processing ideas  and a Spinozan  language is a bod- ily transaction and transformation  perspective  Knapp 41 .  For Butler, identity does have a type of durability that is created through culturally  acceptable  performances:  not  all  roles  are  equally  possible  due  to social limitations and inﬂuences. Jonathan Friedman seems to see iden- tity as more easily altered, declaring that “identity is reduced to a mere mask or role to be taken on at will.... The ability to be able to shift from one iden- tity to the next is a performative phenomenon”  76 . Friedman identiﬁes the mask as contributing to identity construction and indeed other scholars from Callois in 1961 to Filiciak in 2003 have investigated the importance of the mask in  the  history  of  societal  identity  play.  Might  not  avatars  represent  a  new incarnation of the mask? Mackay, in pointing out the obvious connections between performativity and table-top RPGs, suggests that role-playing expe- riences  are  as  signiﬁcant  to  identity  construction  as  any  other  life  experi- ences:  Life, identity, and meaning are all understood as consisting of nothing more than language games, exercises in role-playing. Social reality is experienced through the performance of life, the performance of the everyday. In a world of manifest meaninglessness, devoid of any meta- narrative  by  which  to  understand  the  events  around  us,  it  is  only through relishing the role one plays that a person can ﬁnd any sense of satisfaction [154].   2. Locating Identity in New Media Theory  29  For Mackay, all identity is performance, with the roles being played con- stantly in social motion  even as some identity performances are more cul- turally accepted than others . Butler would likely agree with him, just as she would likely agree with Melucci’s connecting identity to body and language:  Between the body and the various languages with which we give a name to our world we must be able to move with ﬂexibility, open to change but respecting our limits. For individuals, this means accepting a ﬁnite existence and the possibility of change. Thus the theme of metamor- phosis, of the ability to assume new forms, returns as a condition for coexistence [67–68].  Melucci also hypothesizes that identity is both a system and a process, point- ing out that “the ﬁeld is deﬁned by a set of relations  making it a system , and is simultaneously able to intervene to act upon itself and to restructure itself  making it a process ”  64 . Here, Melucci clearly states what many of the other postmodern theorists have implied about identity and the tensions and  connections  between  the  internal  and  external  components  that  con- tribute to identity formation.  Identity and Computer Technologies  Identity theorists have also studied the prevalence of computer technol- ogy in the postmodern world. Sherry Turkle is among the most prominent in exploring how the Internet and other computer technologies have impacted the way we think about our self-identities. Identity, Turkle says, “refers to the sameness between two qualities, between a person and his or her persona”  12 . She suggests that the notion of computer windows provides a “power- ful metaphor for thinking about the self as a multiple, distributed system”  14 . A computer user might have several different programs running at one time: a word processing program, an Internet browser, a calculator, and an Email account. Each program’s window can be minimized at will, and the user can bring any of them to the forefront as desired. Turkle believes that this is similar to the different aspects of our self-identity: different facets can be given primacy depending on our needs and wants. Thus, the computer is “an  object  on  the  border  between  self  and  not-self ”   30 .  To  be  sure,  this belief echoes modernism, as it assumes an individual with the agency and power  to  shift  between  these  “windows  of  the  self.”  Nevertheless,  Turkle seems to subscribe to the notion that an individual’s identity is what Lifton has described as “protean”: a self that is “capable of ﬂuid transformations but is grounded in coherence and a moral outlook. It is multiple but integrated.... The essence of this ﬂexible self is not unitary, nor are its parts stable entities. It  is  easy  to  cycle  through  its  aspects  and  these  are  themselves  changing   30  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  through constant communication with each other”  258, 261 . This “ground- ing in coherence” seems similar to Gidden’s notion of a consistent demeanor that runs throughout the varying aspects of self-identity. Turkle’s views on identity situate her between modern and postmodern theoretical positions as she embraces concepts from both.  Allucquere  Roseanne  Stone’s  work  on  cyber  identities,  transgendered peoples, and multiple personality disorders situate her as decidedly postmod- ern in her stance on identity. Like Haraway, she considers the Western notion of a single identity to be inaccurate:  The  self  appears  to  be  a  constant,  unchanging,  stable  product  of  a moment in Western history.... The societal imperative with which we have been raised is that there is one primary persona, or “true iden- tity,” and that in the ofﬂine world — the “real world”— this persona is ﬁrmly attached to a single physical body, by which our existence as a social being is authorized and in which it is grounded. [But this] West- ern idea that the body and the subject are inseparable is an exercise in wish fulﬁllment.... [Identity would] be better described as a process that is also palpably in continual ﬂux [19, 73, 20].  For Stone, computer technologies make visible the essential fact that human identity  is  multiple:  “The  identities  that  emerge  from  [human-machine] interactions [are] fragmented and complex. I see these identities engaged in a wonderful and awesome struggle, straining to make meaning and sense out of their lives”  36 . Stone describes this as a “struggle” because of the history of stigmatization of multiple identities and multiple personalities in Western culture. Stone sees the potential for computer technology to aid in reducing modern views of a single self by allowing viewpoints that increase the accept- ance of identity-as-multiple.  Katherine  Hayles’  conception  of  identity  is  also  heavily  inﬂuenced  by computer technology. Fearful about the direction humanity is headed due to its relationship to technology, she warns of a “posthuman” viewpoint of iden- tity. A posthuman view, she says, privileges informational patterns over the material, “so that embodiment in a biological substrate is seen as an accident of  history  rather  than  an  inevitability  of  life”   20 .  Through  this  lens,  the human body is thought of as “the original prosthesis we all learn to manip- ulate, so that extending or replacing the body with other prostheses becomes a continuation of a process that began before we were born”  21 . Finally, the posthuman view conﬁgures a “human being so that it can be seamlessly artic- ulated with intelligent machines”  21 . Hayles’ views are extreme: humanity is certainly not in a posthuman stage yet. But the question of whether or not the body is necessarily essential to identities is an interesting one. Hayles uses anorexia as an example of how some people already view the body as an object   2. Locating Identity in New Media Theory  31  to be controlled and not intrinsic to the self — she argues it is the mind not the body that seems to be crucial in these cases. Of course, few would argue that anorexia demonstrates a healthy sense of identity, and Giddens would no doubt share Hayles’ concerns about any “posthuman” moves away from bodily  connections  to  identity.  Yet  even  Hayles  admits  to  succumbing  to posthuman thinking about her identity:  I now ﬁnd myself saying things like, “Well, my sleep agent wants to rest, but my food agent says I should go to the store.” Each person who thinks this way begins to envision herself or himself as a posthuman collectivity,  an  “I”  transformed  into  the  “we”  of  autonomous  agents operating together to make a self. The infectious power of this way of thinking gives “we” a performative dimension [24].  When considered in this way, Hayles’ notion of posthuman identity seems in keeping with most other postmodern identity theories that privilege perfor- mativity and multiple, shifting identities. These postmodern identity theo- ries allow space for Gee’s virtual, real-world and projective identities to form. Debates between modern and postmodern identity theories continue. However, most theorists regardless of their camp seem to agree that commu- nication media impact human identity construction. Even modern identity theorists such as Giddens recognize the importance of these external stimuli: “Mediated  experience  has  long  inﬂuenced  both  self-identity  and  the  basic organization of social relations”  4 . This statement is echoed by Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin almost a decade later: “[People] employ media as vehicles for deﬁning personal identity”  231 . Bolter’s and Grusin’s Remedi- ation:  Understanding  New  Media is  a  pivotal  text  discussing  the  impact  of media on human experiences and I use it here to mark a shift in this chap- ter  into  a  review  of  theories  related  to  technologies  and  their  impact  on humanity. To be sure, the identity theories discussed earlier in this chapter are  present  in  much  computer  and  videogame  theory,  as  many  theorists attempt to explore how and why users become immersed in computer tech- nology.  Predictably,  most  computer  and  videogame  theorists  subscribe  to postmodern concepts of identity and identity construction.  Bolter and Grusin introduce two important terms that describe styles of visual  representation  that  are  applicable  to  videogame  theory:  immediacy and hypermediacy. Immediacy’s goal is to “make the viewer forget the pres- ence of the medium and believe that he is in the presence of the objects of representation”  272–273 . When a ﬁlmmaker like Peter Jackson spends mil- lions of dollars to create elaborate costumes, expensive sets, and hundreds of digitalized special effects for the Lord of the Rings ﬁlm trilogy, this is done to  make  viewers  feel  as  if  they  were  “really  there”   5   in  Middle  Earth  as Bolter and Grusin put it. However, immediacy in videogames  and in most   32  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  other media forms  is heavily dependent on hypermediacy: a style where the goal is to remind the viewer of the medium. How is it that these two styles with opposite goals actually work together? Bolter and Grusin illustrate this principle in the concept of the ﬂight simulator, one of the earliest genres of computer game:  The action unfolds in real time, as the player is required to monitor the  instruments  and  ﬂy  the  plane.  The  game  promises  to  show  the player what it is like to be a pilot, and yet in what does this immedi- acy of the experience consist? As in a real plane, the simulated cockpit is full of dials to read and switches to ﬂip. As in a real plane, the expe- rience of the game is that of working an interface, so that the imme- diacy of this experience is pure hypermediacy [11].  Bolter and Grusin here demonstrate the importance of the computer inter- face to computer human interactions. Scholars have deﬁned “interface” in a few interesting ways. Mackay calls interfaces “material objects that allow par- ticipants to perceive the imaginary realm”  78 . This general deﬁnition would apply to the projection of ﬁlm onto a movie screen and the pages of a fan- tasy  novel  as  well  as  to  computer  hardware  that  allows  the  playing  of  a videogame.  Wolf  provides  a  deﬁnition  more  speciﬁcally  tailored  to  video- games: “the boundary between the player and the video game itself. The inter- face is really a junction point between input and output, hardware and soft- ware,  and  the  player  and  the  material  game  itself,  and  the  portal  through which player activity occurs”  15 . In this deﬁnition “interface” includes all peripheral devices like the keyboard, mouse, screen, and speakers and also onscreen  graphical  elements  like  buttons,  scroll  bars,  and  windows.  Most interesting  in  Wolf ’s  deﬁnition  when  considering  identity  is  the  last  part where he suggests the interface is a “portal,” a “junction,” for activity. I am reminded here of how Gee describes projective identity: the middle ground identity between the real-world and virtual identity is also portal-like. Per- haps for experienced computer users, the windows-like computer interface becomes “transparent”: it is easy for these users to see how to make the inter- face work, and how to negotiate between the different windows, so much so that they don’t have to actively concentrate on the interface itself. It’s like the tacit knowledge involved in driving a car: even as there is a complex inter- face, with multiple and continuous tasks to perform, soon enough we’re able to work the interface almost unconsciously and get “beyond” it to focus on the external world through the windows. The internal workings of the car become transparent; so too do the external workings of the computer inter- face.  Most videogame scholars seem to agree that having the computer inter- face  become  transparent  is  one  of  the  key  criteria  for  a  truly  “immersive”   2. Locating Identity in New Media Theory  33  video gaming experience. Immersion is a term that is used frequently by both popular and critical culture when discussing the appeal of videogames. Like so  many  key  concepts,  it  has  been  deﬁned  in  different  ways.  Murray’s deﬁnition is the most often cited; she describes immersion as “the experience of being transported to an elaborately simulated place”  98 . She believes that there is an “age-old desire to live out a fantasy aroused by a ﬁctional world”  98  and that computer technology makes this possible in more tangible ways than ever before. Murray also believes that immersion does not so much sus- pend belief as it actively creates belief and that these elaborately simulated places can “become real through use”  11 . Alison McMahan, acknowledging Murray’s  deﬁnition  of  immersion,  offers  a  somewhat  different,  more videogame-speciﬁc, deﬁnition: “the player is caught up in the world of the game’s story  the diegetic level , but [immersion] also refers to the player’s love of the game and the strategy that goes into it  the nondiegetic level ”  68 .  She  also  identiﬁes  three  conditions  needed  to  create  immersion  in  a video game: 1  user expectations for the game environment and the actual game environment must be aligned; 2  the user’s actions in the game world must have a “non-trivial impact”  69  on the game world; 3  the conventions of the gameworld must be internally consistent. These criteria provide a use- ful guide to ascertaining what factors contribute to user immersion levels in v–RPGs.  Nicola Green’s discussion of immersion connects well to Gee’s tripartite notions of identity, suggesting that the immersion that takes place in virtual worlds is in fact not purely disembodied at all, but instead is heavily grounded in prior, non-virtual social experiences. He argues that the human-techni- cal interface by necessity uses these pre-existing  prior to entry into the vir- tual world  experiences as referents  59–60 . This seems to support the notion of a ﬂuid ground between real-world and virtual world conceptions.  Few videogame scholars have contributed more terminology to help the- orize the rhetorical approaches of videogames than Espen Aarseth. In Cyber- text: Perspectives on Ergodic Literature he introduces the concept of “ergodic” literature, where “nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text ... it requires hard work in the form of concentration as well as con- scious instead of automatic adjustment of eye focus and distance”  1, 180 . These ergodic texts that require more active work to be understood  includ- ing hypertexts and adventure games  he refers to as “cybertexts”: dynamic texts  that  require  action   rather  than  passivity   on  the  part  of  the reader player. Wolf provides a more simple deﬁnition of Aarseth’s complex term ergodic: “the action has some physical aspect to it and is not strictly an activity occurring purely on the mental plane”  15 . Aarseth uses this term to help differentiate videogames from not only movies and television shows   34  MY AVATAR, MY SELF   passive activities that require no physical work from the viewer  but also from traditional novels and stories: simply turning the pages of a book does not constitute “nontrivial” effort in Aarseth’s eyes. Videogames, though, have a deﬁnite work aspect to them: “Gameplay requires all kinds of work includ- ing concentration, endurance, and coordination. Gaming requires strategy, skill, imagination — in essence hard work. A player’s work interacts with the computer game’s work to create the user experience”  Ruggill, et al. 299–302 . Of course, the title of Aarseth’s book does refer to ergodic “literature,” which  seems  to  privilege  story  and  sequentiality.  Earlier  in  this  chapter,  I noted that Giddens suggested that self-identity was maintained by the indi- vidual’s  internal  narrative;  here  too  Aarseth’s  usage  of  the  word  literature  along with the examples his book provides  highlights his privileging of nar- rativity in identity meaning-making. But is a narrative essential to identity construction,  particularly  in  new  digital  media  like  videogames?  Before returning to discuss more of Aarseth’s terminology, I pause here to turn my attention brieﬂy to the relationship between narrative theory and videogame technologies.  Narrative Theory  As  mentioned  earlier,  Murray  focuses  her  theories  in  Hamlet  on  the Holodeck almost exclusively around narrativity  linear, sequential stories that help create meaning for individuals and society  and the impact of computer technology  on  narratives.  Like  Bolter  and  Grusin,  Murray  stresses  “trans- parency” in communication technology, arguing that ﬁctive works  regard- less  of  medium   “help  us  understand  the  world  and  what  it  means  to  be human. Eventually all successful storytelling technologies become transpar- ent: we lose consciousness of the medium and see only the power of the story itself ”  26 . Crucial to stories’ powerful potential was something Murray calls an “objective correlative,” a term she borrowed from T.S. Eliot. It describes the way “clusters of events in literary works can capture emotional experi- ence”  93 . The computer, Murray says, allows users to “create objective cor- relatives for thinking about the many systems we participate in, observe, and imagine”  93 . She seems to feel that emotional experiences can be captured in computer spaces, just as they can in more traditional narrative spaces.  Rather  than  expressing  apprehension  over  the  changes  that  computer technologies might wreak on narratives, Murray seems optimistic that cer- tain types of narrative experiences might be better “told” in digital spaces.2 One of these she identiﬁes as the multiform story: “A written or dramatic nar- rative that presents a single situation or plotline in multiple versions, ver- sions  that  would  be  mutually  exclusive  in  our  ordinary  experience”   30 .   2. Locating Identity in New Media Theory  35  Video-RPGs seem well suited to this type of story: users can reload a saved game and replay sections using different tactics  stealth vs. brute strength vs. magic, for example  or can start an entirely new game and create a very dif- ferent type of avatar with different attributes, gender, or race. The multiple possibilities allow the user reader a “more active role, a more creative role, in the experience”  38 .  Murray also believes narratives have transformational capabilities:  Storytelling can be a powerful agent of personal transformation. The right stories can open our hearts and change who we are. Digital nar- ratives offer us the opportunity to enact stories rather than to merely witness them. Enacted events have a transformative power that exceeds both narrated and conventionally dramatized events because we assim- ilate them as personal experiences [171].  This passage shows that Murray believes digital narratives have the potential to  be  more  powerful  than  traditional  narratives  due  to  enactment.  Sal Humphreys agrees, identifying the user as a co-producer of the narrative text:  The line between production and consumption of the text has become blurred.... Computer games bring players into a productive relation- ship  with  the  text.  This  is  more  than  identity  construction  through consumption;  this  is  an  engagement  which  serves  to  create  the  text each time it is engaged. The engagement comes because the player is the performer, and the game evaluates the performance and adapts to it [37, 38].  Of course, whether or not this means one is transformed by the engage- ment is debatable. In some ways, though, videogame narratives are similar to traditional narratives in that they rely heavily on what Ryan calls “the most prominent reason for acting in life and therefore the most fundamental nar- rative  pattern”   2–3 :  problem-solving.  Murray  too  acknowledges  that  the “agon,  or  contest  between  opponents,  is  the  most  common  form  of  game [and] also the earliest form of narrative. Opposition is one of the most per- vasive organizing principles of human intelligence and language”  145 . I am unable to locate a v–RPG that does not revolve around problem-solving and conﬂict, so in this sense digital narratives remain as predictable as traditional ones. However, the immersive potential of digital narratives as a result of the user contributing to the text is intriguing; whether or not this narrative pro- duction can help lead to identity formation is the open question.  Aarseth clearly believes that cybertexts  or digital narratives  are quite different from traditional narratives since he is adamant in his view that the cybertext reader is not a voyeur. Voyeurs, he says, operate out of safe posi- tions— watching without involvement. But he sees the cybertext in an oppo- site light: “a cybertext puts its reader at risk: the risk of rejection”  4 . There   36  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  is uncertainty when “reading” a cybertext, as there is no clear linear, sequen- tial narrative path to follow. He uses the term “aporia” to describe the way that a cybertext prevents the user reader from making sense of the whole text by withholding access to a particular part of the text. Aarseth points out that the dialectic between aporias and epiphanies  the connection between search- ing and ﬁnding  is typical of games in general and “is not a narrative struc- ture but a more fundamental layer of human experience”  92 . Cybertexts  and v–RPGs  also provide an immersion-inducing balance between anamor- phosis and metamorphosis. Anamorphosis occurs when there is a clear, ﬁnal state of resolution, where all is revealed. A user can achieve anamorphosis in a single-player v–RPG if they choose to play the game long enough. Yet many single-player v–RPGs  and all MMO-RPGs  are also metamorphic texts, hav- ing the potential for near endless transformation with no ﬁnal state reached. Murray calls this “refused closure,” suggesting that “because of its ability to both offer and withhold, the computer is a seductive medium in which much of  the  pleasure  lies  in  the  sustained  engagement,  the  refusal  of  climax”  174–75 . Fallout 2 demonstrates videogames’ abilities to both offer and with- hold quite clearly. Completion of the v–RPG’s main narrative arc is contin- ually delayed. First, the Chosen One’s task is to save his village, Arroyo, by ﬁnding a Garden of Eden Creation Kit  GECK . The GECK is reputed to be able to allow life to ﬂourish in the post-apocalyptic world the game is set in. However, once the Chosen One ﬁnds the GECK and returns to Arroyo, the gamer learns that the people of Arroyo  the Chosen One’s family and friends  have been taken prisoner by the Enclave, an organized gang made up of the last  remaining  members  of  the  former  U.S.  government.  The  Chosen  One must now track the Enclave, learn where their hideout is located, and free the villagers of Arroyo. The Chosen One must search the Wastes, moving from town to town, seeking clues as to the location of the Enclave. In this way Fall- out  2 is  clearly  metamorphic,  requiring  several  dozen  hours  of  gameplay before the narrative’s ﬁnal anamorphosis  destroying the Enclave’s headquar- ters and escaping with the Arroyo villagers  can be achieved. But Fallout 2 offers continual opportunities for many smaller anamorphic moments along the way as well. In each town, the Chosen One encounters NPCs who need help with problems of their own, each of whom are willing to trade informa- tion about the Enclave for the Chosen One’s help. These mini-missions can often be completed relatively quickly, thus providing the gamer with the sat- isfaction  of  closure  and  a  job  well  done  while  still  promising  many  more opportunities to explore and develop the avatar and the game’s larger narra- tive. The v–RPG genre seems to be able to transcend either or dichotomies  aporia vs. epiphany, anamorphosis vs. metamorphosis  and blurs the bound- ary between these binaric terms. The genre also takes full advantage of epis-   2. Locating Identity in New Media Theory  37  temophilia in general: the human desire to know things and to be able to exact some measure of control over the obtainment of knowledge  Mulvey .  Aarseth points out another way cybernarratives are different from tra- ditional narratives through his usage of the terms “intrigue” and “intriguee.” Intrigue, he says, describes the plot of which the user is the target “with an outcome that is not yet decided — or rather with several possible outcomes that depend on various factors, such as the cleverness and experience of the player”  112 . The target of the intrigue he names the “intriguee.”3 Aarseth explains how the intriguee is different from the main character of a linear novel in the following way: “The user assumes the role of the main charac- ter and, therefore, will not come to see this person as an other, or as a per- son at all, but rather as a remote-controlled extension of herself ”  113 . The player becomes the main character of a cybertext in a way that a reader of novel never does: the user-as-producer notion described by Humphreys ear- lier here. Again, Fallout 2 typiﬁes the way v–RPGs situate the user’s avatar as intriguee. In the cinematic cutscene that begins the game, the village Elder of Arroyo recites the following speech to the user avatar:  Truly, you are the Chosen One. It is to you that we turn as our Arroyo— our village, our home —faces its hour of greatest need. In all the years since our ancestor, the vault dweller, founded Arroyo, our people have known hardship many times. But never before has our village suffered so long a period of trial. The wells are almost dry, crops wither in the ﬁelds, the old and the young alike sicken, and our Brahmin are dying. We have hope, Chosen One — an object spoken of in the sacred text of our  ancestor.  It  is  the  birthright  of  our  people,  the  Garden  of  Eden Creation Kit, the wondrous GECK. Only that can save us now.... You must travel the Wastes to ﬁnd the GECK. This is the only way our peo- ple  may  yet  be  saved....  Fear  not,  Chosen  One — the  strength  of  the Vault Dweller runs strong in your veins. I know that you shall not fail us... [Fallout 2 strategy guide, x].  The Elder’s speech clearly identiﬁes Fallout 2’s setting  the village of Arroyo, in the middle of the radioactive Wastes , the main character  the avatar as the Chosen One , and the initial plot  ﬁnd a GECK somewhere in the Wastes, and return it to Arroyo . The speech also references the avatar of Fallout, the Vault Dweller  thus linking the narratives of the two games together . The Elder’s usage of the word “you” in this speech comes to represent both the Chosen One avatar and the “real-world” user, creating identiﬁcatory fusion. It seems clear that for Aarseth and other narrative theorists that the inter- active qualities of cybertexts and videogames, the creative, productive pow- ers given to the reader user, are crucial to the immersive potentials of these texts and to their potential to aid in identity construction. Jill Walker pro- vides yet another deﬁnition of interaction that highlights the connected, recip-   38  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  rocal nature of the relationship between user and computer: “Users must per- form physical actions beyond perceptual actions  such as looking and listen- ing  in order to access digital works ... there is a feedback loop between user and  machine  where  the  user  has  some  inﬂuence  on  the  machine  and  the machine has some inﬂuence on the user”  1 . Walker refers to this merger of the  actual  and  ﬁctional  worlds  as  “ontological  fusion”:  the  user  is  able  to “imagine both her perceptual actions and her manipulation of the work as being ﬁctional as well as actual”  8 . The reciprocity of this ontological fusion is crucial to Gee’s notions of identities as well.  Earlier, I discussed Bolter’s and Grusin’s demonstration of immediacy and hyperimmediacy as applied to ﬂight “simulators” leading to immersion. Simulation is an important concept invoked by many videogame theorists to explain the transparent, immersive nature of a videogame experience. Gon- zalo Frasca deﬁnes a simulation as an artiﬁcial system that models a more complex system while retaining some of original system’s behavior  Walker 2 . Sid Meier’s famous Gettysburg! is a good example of a simulation: it recre- ates  the  Civil  War  battle  of  Gettysburg  for  the  user  in  virtual  space.  This includes not only the regiments of the Union and Confederate armies, but also the geographical terrain the battle was fought on: the game’s theme and content  are  based  on  events  that  have  real,  non-virtual  world  equivalents. Simulations attempt to provide verisimilitude: they attempt to be life-like and realistic even as they are copies rather than originals. As Turkle points out, in  the  postmodern  technological  world,  it  becomes  continually  easier  for users to immerse themselves in computer simulations: “We have learned to take things at interface value. We are moving toward a culture of simulation in which people are increasingly comfortable with substituting representa- tions of reality for the real”  23 . However, not all videogames are simula- tions. What about a videogame such as Final Fantasy X, which invites the user to explore a mythical world that has no real-world equivalent, and offers the user’s avatar the opportunity to use magical powers that don’t exist outside of that virtual space? If this type of videogame space is not simulation, what is it?  Simulacra and Virtual Space  Jean  Baudrillard  provides  another  possibility  by  introducing  the  term “simulacra”: copies without originals. The most famous example of this Bau- drillard cites is Disneyland, which aims to recreate an innocent version of America that never really existed in the ﬁrst place: “This world wants to be childish in order to make us believe that the adults are elsewhere, in the ‘real’ world, and to conceal the fact that true childishness is everywhere — that it   2. Locating Identity in New Media Theory  39  is that of the adults themselves who come here to act the child in order to foster illusions as to their real childishness”  13 . Disneyland’s Main Street USA is therefore a copy of an American street that exists nowhere else. Many v–RPGs are simulacra rather than simulations, as they offer virtual copies of worlds that have no real-world equivalents. In Turkle’s words: “The objects on the screen have no simple physical referent. In this sense, life on the screen is without origins and foundation. It is a place where signs taken for reality may  substitute  for  the  real.  Its  aesthetic  has  to  do  with  manipulation  and recombination”  47 .  Baudrillard refers to “worlds” and Turkle to “places.” Both terms imply a spatial aspect to virtual reality, and the notion of “space” is signiﬁcant to videogame interaction. Turkle’s own deﬁnition of virtual reality displays this connection: “the metaphorical spaces that arise only through interaction with the computer”  181 . Later in her book, Turkle quotes William Gibson in dis- cussing virtual space: “Everyone who works with computers seems to develop an intuitive faith that there’s some kind of actual space behind the screen”  265 . Of course, different genres of videogames present space in different ways. Wolf describes eleven different types of videogame spaces; video role- playing games ﬁt into his tenth and eleventh categories as they are both “inter- active three-dimensional environments” and also typically “mapped space.”4 In  interactive  3D,  “spaces  and  objects  can  be  viewed  from  multiple  angles and viewpoints which are all linked together in such a way as to make the diegetic world appear to have at least enough spatial consistency so as to be navigable by the player”  66 .5 As videogame worlds grew  thanks to expanded computing  power   and  became  more  complex,  conceptual  maps  became important to aid the user in virtual navigation. In essence, they are onscreen representations of off-screen spaces.6  Bernadette Flynn, drawing on Lefebvre’s The Production of Space, iden- tiﬁes three levels through which spatial practices can be analyzed. First are material spatial practices: experiences that have taken place in the non-vir- tual world. Second are representations of space: perceptions. Third are spaces of representation: imagination. I ﬁnd the distinction between these last two tenuous. Perception seems to require external stimuli, some space that can be seen. Imagination need not draw on sight; one need only hear about a space to be able to imagine it  or a form of it . Yet all three seem connected when Flynn says, “Navigation is a pilgrimage where the imagination is shaped by the spaces it passes through and which may in turn shape the spaces it passes through”  2 . So, the mind also has a spatial aspect to it. Later, drawing on de Certeau, Flynn points out that the act of walking “opens up a place to human creativity  and  articulation,  transforming  it  into  a  space  of  enunciation  ... repeated exploration of a game environment and its cultural contents creates   40  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  a mnemonic of the landscape where associations within the game world trig- ger other cultural and imaginative associations”  2 . It is interesting to note that avatars in v–RPGs traverse their gameworlds mainly on foot  as opposed to in spaceships, race cars, or in airplanes as is more typical in many action- oriented videogame genres ; additional research is needed to explore whether or not this on-foot navigation contributes to identity transformation.  Aarseth would characterize the traversable spaces of v–RPGs as multic- ursal labyrinths where there are a series of critical choices in which path is taken through the gameworld. He distinguishes this type of labyrinth from the unicursal labyrinth where there is only path. Aarseth’s notion of labyrinths differs from Umberto Eco’s. In Semiotics and the Philosophy of Language Eco describes  three  distinct  labyrinth  types:  the  linear,  the  maze,  and  the  rhi- zome. The linear  only one path is possible  and the maze  many choices for travel exist  correspond to Aarseth’s unicursal and multicursal, respectively, but  the  rhizome  has  no  parallel  in  Aarseth’s  terminology.  In A  Thousand Plateaus DeLeuze and Guattari describe a rhizome as a theoretical net where every point can be connected with every other point; Murray refers to it as “a tuber root system in which any point may be connected to any other point”  132 . Murray suggests that videogame agency, “the satisfying power to take meaningful action and see the results of our decisions and choices”  126 , can be obtained through navigation and identiﬁes two navigable conﬁgurations in videogames: the solvable maze  similar to Aarseth’s unicursal maze and Eco’s linear labyrinth and maze  and the tangled rhizome. A rhizomatic text would be one that does not privilege any one order of reading. Murray sug- gests this “frustrates our desire for narrational agency” but then goes on to admit that the unsolvable rhizomatic maze “does hold promise as an expres- sive structure. Walking through a rhizome one enacts a story of wandering, of being enticed in conﬂicting directions, of feeling helpless to orient oneself, but [the experience] is oddly reassuring. In the rhizome, one is constantly threatened  but  also  continuously  enclosed.  The  fact  that  the  plot  will  not resolve means that no irreparable loss will be suffered”  133 . Filiciak believes the  rhizome  to  be  “the  perfect  metaphor  to  describe  the  user  of  electronic media; we cannot talk anymore about a single identity that produces tempo- rary identities subordinate to itself. Thus, we should rather talk about hyper- identity. It is more a process than a ﬁnished formation”  96–97 . Here we see Melucci’s concept of identity formation as a system and a process echoed.  Point of View  Whether video game space is labyrinthine or rhizomatic, it seems clear that  users  must  feel  as  if  they  have  a  presence  in  this  space  in  order  to  be   2. Locating Identity in New Media Theory  41  immersed and identify with the gaming experience. But, of course, the user remains present in the non-virtual space they occupy as well. Taylor uses the term “telepresence” to describe this ability of an individual to be present in multiple spatial domains. For Taylor, point of view within the gameworld is crucial  to  any  theorizing  of  how  the  user  perceives  the  game  space  and identiﬁes with their avatar. She explains the connections between avatarial identiﬁcation  and  point  of  view   POV   in  the  following  way:  “The  player identiﬁes sufﬁciently with objects or characters of the game space to function in response to that game space through a self-image that is inserted into the constructs of the game space and then internalized by the player”  5 . This self-image Taylor refers to is the avatar. In videogames, two types of POV are possible: ﬁrst-person POV and third-person POV.  In chapter one, I described Battlezone as the ﬁrst ﬁrst-person POV video game: the user played “through the eyes” of a tank commander. First-person POV places the user inside the body of the avatar or agent: the gameworld is seen as if looking through these virtual eyes. Typically, the only parts of the avatar that can be seen in this view are the hands, extended in front of the virtual, invisible body. Third-person POV allows the user to see the avatar or agent’s whole “body,” usually from a camera position above and behind the avatar. PONG allowed the user to control the table-tennis racket  depicted as a small rectangle on the screen , but did not place the user inside the racket; rather the user looked down upon the virtual table from an overhead per- spective.  Exactly which POV, ﬁrst- or third-person, allows for greater identiﬁca- tion between avatar and user is debated among scholars. Taylor’s argument in favor of the identiﬁcatory power of ﬁrst-person POV shows this uncer- tainty:  Players have more direct agency in ﬁrst-person shooters, due in large part because FPS games are identiﬁed by their predication on action and control, and that this sense of agency creates a sense of primary identiﬁcation with the player as being within the game. Yet, FPS games also disrupt the gaze by removing the player from the ﬁeld of the gaze.... Playing ﬁrst-person I play as me so I never pass through the medium of screen; acting on the screen rather than within the screen because I have  identiﬁed  with  and  taken  in  only  my  own  actions  instead  of  a character’s. Essentially, from a position alone the player cannot enter into the game space as part of that game space because of the lack of context which embodiment, in third-person point of view games, pro- vides [6, 8].  It seems reasonable that more agency might lead to greater identiﬁcation  and Taylor claims the ﬁrst-person perspective provides the greatest agency : con-   42  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  trol over one’s own actions and relative freedom to act as one chooses allow actions that will be embraced more readily by one’s identity. However, it also seems that for a gamer to identify as completely with their avatar as possi- ble, they ought to be “passing through the medium of the screen” and “within the  screen”  to  experience  immediacy.  But  this  quality  Taylor  gives  to  the third-person perspective. Stephen Clarke-Willson suggests that third-person POV  is  more  complex   and  therefore  has  greater  identiﬁcatory  potential  because it allows the user to see the avatar in the gameworld; the ﬁrst-per- son POV he sees as more visceral. Gee sees both perspectives as contribut- ing to identity construction: “First-person mode feels closer to the character and allows you to identify tightly with [the avatar’s] situatedness in the world. Third-person mode allows you to see [the avatar’s] body, actions, and reac- tions and identify with him from a thematic point of view, since you now have  images  to  help  with  the  identity  play  you  are  engaged  in  being  [the avatar]”  Why Video Games 71 . Bolter and Grusin choose not to take a side in this debate, but instead simply stress the signiﬁcance of POV in videogam- ing experiences: “Empathy is highly regarded as a means of knowing [and] the path to empathy is the occupation of another’s point of view”  245–46 . So, taking on another’s viewpoint leads to empathy which is a way to obtain knowledge. This leads to an interesting question: what knowledge can v–RPG users hope to gain by taking on the viewpoint of their avatars? Perhaps the answer lies in part in the following observation from Bolter and Grusin: “Fas- cination  with  media  works  as  the  sublimation  of  the  desire,  central  to  the Western  tradition,  to  be  immediately  present  to  oneself ”   236 .  Perhaps avatars  in  v–RPGs  make  elements  of  the  user’s  self  present  to  themselves, tangible in ways that might not be possible in non-virtual spaces. Perhaps gamers hope to come to know parts of their self better through the empathy they experience with their avatar.  These are existential speculations, and I am reminded here of a state- ment made by Giddens as he contemplates the formation of self-identity: “All humans live in circumstances of existential contradiction: we are of the inan- imate world, yet set off against it, as self-conscious beings aware of our ﬁnite character.... [A key] existential question concerns the existence of other per- sons. Although the individual can perceive the body of another person he or she cannot perceive that individual as subject”  49, 50 . Giddens’ words here are interesting when applied to v–RPG avatars, which are effectively immor- tal. Users can continually reload from earlier saved points if the avatar dies in the game world. Also, avatars are individuals that can be perceived as sub- jects and objects, both other and not other at the same time. To be both self and not-self is likely existentially enticing for some users.  This virtual identity experimentation is made even more enticing when   2. Locating Identity in New Media Theory  43  the bricolage aspect of videogame play is considered. Turkle explains how this works in virtual environments:  Bricoleurs approach problem-solving by entering into a relationship with their work materials that has more the ﬂavor of a conversation than a monologue.... The revaluation of bricolage in the culture of sim- ulation includes a new emphasis on visualization and the development of  intuition  through  the  manipulation  of  virtual  objects.  Instead  of having to follow a set of rules laid down in advance, computer users are encouraged to tinker in simulated microworlds. There, they learn about how things work by interacting with them [51, 52].  Any experienced videogamer is aware that trial and error plays a substantial role in how the user learns to be successful in the videogame space. Turkle certainly acknowledges the element of play  pleasurable repetitive learning processes, Grodal 153  in videogames: “To learn to play you have to play to learn”  70 . Nikos Papastergiadis directly connects bricolage to identity con- struction:  Identity is never ﬁxed once and for all, never coheres into an absolute form.... Identity always presupposes a sense of location and a relation- ship with others.... Any theory of agency must also include the process of bricolage. Identity is always conceived in the ’twixt of displacement and re-invention; representations of identity are at best a rear view of a part of the past that is pushing us forward into the future [277–78].  In this passage, the author points out identities are deﬁned in relationship to external stimuli, similar to Burkean merger and division. This quote is also reminiscent of Friedman’s notion of a ﬂuid and ever-changing identity.  Papastergiadis  mentions  another  factor  that  makes  it  easier  for  some videogame users to experience identiﬁcation within virtual spaces when he notes that identity “presupposes a relationship with” another. Several exam- ples illuminate an interesting truth: humans have a tendency to ascribe to computer technologies too much intelligence: in a sense, we anthropomor- phize them. Turkle, citing famous examples like the Turing test-inspired bot “Julia” and the ELIZA tests, concludes that often humans “treat responsive computer  programs  as  more  intelligent  than  they  really  are.  Very  small amounts  of  interactivity  cause  us  to  project  our  own  complexity  onto  the undeserving object ... the fake seem[s] more compelling than the real”  101, 237 . It is not difﬁcult to imagine this happening when a user “projects” an identity into onto a virtual avatar, but Wolf hypothesizes that the computer can actually have an identity as a player in a videogame, an active opponent that competes with the human user: “By assigning an identity  consciously or not  to the computer player, competition becomes possible and emotional stakes  are  raised”   15 .  McMahan  echoes  this  sentiment,  arguing  that  the   44  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  non-player characters  NPCs  within a gameworld can contribute to immer- sion:  “The  use  of  a  synthetic  social  actor   NPC   can  lead  to  a  heightened sense of presence, [since] users respond to the computer itself as an intelli- gent,  social  agent....  Conversing  with  artiﬁcial  characters  is  social  interac- tion”  78–79, 80 . Of course, the more “synthetic” the NPCs are  the more interactive and “realistic” they appear  the higher the gamer presence is likely to be.  So,  where  does  this  labyrinth  of  identity  and  videogame  theories  and terms lead? I believe that the content of video role-playing games may indeed allow for some users to experience identiﬁcation with their avatars in those virtual spaces, thus lending credence to Gee’s theories on real-world, virtual, and  projective  identities.  Of  course,  the  v–RPG  is  but  one  genre  of  video game, and I would be remiss if I did not explore the connections between genre theory and identity in this chapter.  Genre Theory  Like so many of the terms essential to this study, “genre” has been deﬁned differently by scholars. For Halliday, genres are “conﬁgurations of semantic resources that members of the culture associate with a situation type”  Coe et al. 111 . For Green genres are “structuring devices for realizing meaning in speciﬁc contexts”  Coe et al. 86 . Miller deﬁnes them as “typiﬁed rhetorical actions based in recurrent situations”  Coe et al. 103 . These deﬁnitions share much  common  ground:  essentially,  genres  are  discursive  forms  that  are socially  acceptable  for  responding  to  recurring  situations   2 .  Since  these forms are socially created they are not neutral nor are they value-free. Pierre Bordieu’s famous notion of the “habitus” is consistent with much genre the- ory:  The conditionings associated with a particular class of conditions of existence produce habitus, systems of durable, transposable disposi- tions,  structured  structures  predisposed  to  function  as  structuring structures,  that  is,  principles  which  generate  and  organize  practices and representations that can be objectively adapted to their outcomes without presupposing a conscious aiming at ends or an express mas- tery of the operations necessary in order to attain them [53].  Essentially, the habitus guides individuals in the course of their daily lives on how to act, inﬂuencing their actions and inclinations by providing a sense of what is appropriate.  Genre impacts video role-playing games on three distinct levels. First is the genre “videogame.” Videogames are forms of electronic entertainment that  use  computer  communication  technologies.  Earlier  discussion  in  this   2. Locating Identity in New Media Theory  45  chapter has differentiated them from other media like ﬁlm and television due to the interactive, productive, participatory, and “work” aspects of videogames  all leading to the potential for high levels of immersion and identiﬁcation . At this point I ﬁnd it important to deﬁne “game” as doing so will show the connection to genre theory. Videogame designer Crawford deﬁnes games as “closed  formal  systems  that  subjectively  represent  a  subset  of  reality”  Thorhauge 2 . Callois suggests that games are accompanied by a “certain con- science of a second reality or of utter unreality in relation to ordinary life”  Thorhauge 2 . Video-RPGs ﬁt both of these deﬁnitions well. These theorists also believe that games require players to take on a “lusory” attitude: a will- ingness to accept the rules of the game so that the game can be played. This notion  seems  closely  tied  to  genre:  the  conventions  of  a  genre  must  be accepted and understood in order to have an identiﬁcatory experience. Sec- ond  is  the  genre  of  videogame:  “role-playing  games.”  In  chapter  one  I described how the v–RPG is unique in its usage of true avatars  as opposed to  agents ,  and  the  freedom  of  choice  given  to  the  user  in  navigating  the gameworld. The third type of genre relevant to v–RPGs is the “gameworld” and  its  setting:  the  vast  majority  of  v–RPGs   and  table-top  RPGs  for  that matter   have  fantasy  settings  reminiscent  of  Gygax’s  Dungeons  &  Dragons  who was, if you’ll remember, inﬂuenced heavily by Tolkien’s Middle Earth . Technologically  limited  worlds  replete  with  magic  and  mythical  creatures have become canonical in the fantasy genre and most v–RPG worlds are riffs off of this formula.  Other theorists provide more tangible connections between genre the- ory, videogames, and identity. Charles Bazerman speaks of genre as if it was physical  space:  “If  you  hang  around  a  certain  place  long  enough  you  will become the kind of person who hangs around that kind of place ... the places you habituate will develop those parts of you that are most related to and oriented  towards  the  activities  of  that  space”   14 .  Does  Bazerman  believe that it is the actual physical space where the person is hanging around that will  cause  this  change?  No:  it  is  the  discourse s   happening  in  and  at  that place and the individual’s internal reﬂection on that discourse that will alter identity. Given this chapter’s earlier discussion on videogame space, Bazer- man’s connection of space to identity and genre is interesting. He takes his explanations of these connections even further:  Going to the place is only the ﬁrst step, for once you are there you need access and encouragement to engage in particular roles, use particular resources, and take part in particular experiences and activities. When [you occupy the space of a genre] you begin thinking in actively pro- ductive ways that belong in that form of life and you take on all the feelings, hopes, uncertainties, and anxieties about becoming a visible   46  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  presence in that world and participating in the available activities. You develop  and  become  committed  to  the  identity  you  are  carving  out within that domain. The particular ranges of feelings, impulses, and stances that you adopt in orienting to that world develop in interac- tion with the people and activities within that world [14].  Bazerman’s view resonates provocatively when applied to the virtual spaces user avatars “live” in. I am reminded of Coe’s words as he speculates on the inevitability of identiﬁcation with and within genres: “To what extent and for how long can people [experience] a particular subject position without identifying  themselves  with  that  position  and  all  it  entails?”   4 .  I  would instead ask a similar question: to what extent can one play a video–RPG from a particular subject position without identifying themselves with the posi- tion  avatar  they’ve taken up, particularly when the user has chosen from the start, willfully and purposefully, to identify with the avatar?  Of course, Bazerman points out that it is the “discourse” within the genre that  inﬂuences  identity.  This  leads  to  another  important  question:  do  the interactions with videogames constitute discourse? Coe deﬁnes discourse as “strategic response to situation”  6 ; the choices made in v–RPGs certainly seem to ﬁt this deﬁnition. In Genre and the New Rhetoric Freedman and Med- way even suggest a game metaphor for the social nature of generic discourse, suggesting that such discourse requires at least two genres and two “players” who react to each others’ “moves.” These reactions may be tacit. As I’ve already shown in Turkle, Wolf, and McMahan, users treat the videogame world and the NPCs encountered there as a second “player” who responds to the user’s choices based on the system guidelines created by the game designers. Given these deﬁnitions, discourse and therefore identity construction is possible via videogame interaction.  In  this  chapter  I  have  examined  postmodern  and  modern  theories  of identity. I have also explored a range of videogame theories introducing cru- cial terminology such as immersion, simulacra, diegetic space, interface, and point of view. To fully analyze identity theory and videogame theory it has been necessary to discuss narrative theory and genre theory as well. Exactly what  the  relationship  is  between  Gee’s  real-world,  virtual,  and  projective identities remains unclear, as does the means by which the avatars of video role-playing games might inﬂuence these identities; knowing which variables in a user’s gameplay experience are essential to identity formation has yet to be pinpointed in existing research. It is these gaps in identity and videogame theory that this study attempts to ﬁll. I close this chapter with one ﬁnal state- ment  from  James  Newman,  who  argues  that  the  visual  appearance  of  the avatar is overrated and is relatively insigniﬁcant to an immersive videogame experience  10 . Instead, he views the pleasures of videogame play as “kinaes-   2. Locating Identity in New Media Theory  47  thetic:” every aspect of the gameworld is simultaneously important. This is a belief similar to Friedman’s, who Newman cites here. Newman points out that gamers talk about “being” rather than “playing” or “controlling.” There- fore,  he  argues,  “The  level  of  engagement,  immersion  or  presence  experi- enced by the player is not contingent upon representation ... the notion of an identiﬁable and singular entity embodied by the player may be an oversim- pliﬁcation indicative of an implicit reliance on existent models of audience”  8, 11 . Newman suggests that identiﬁcation within videogame space is overde- termined: there are likely many factors that contribute, including avatarial construction freedom, interaction with NPCs, the narrative  or lack of one , the space of the gameworld, point of view, and the ability for the interface to become transparent enabling immediacy. I agree with Newman; all of these variables play crucial roles in avatarial immersion. Therefore, in this study, I have selected video role-playing games that allow users much freedom not only in constructing their virtual identities but also in navigating the game- world.  These  v–RPGs  are Morrowind,  Oblivion,  and Fallout  3.  I  thought  it important to collect data from different types of videogame players for this study to ascertain how varying perceptions of the connections between vir- tual identities and real-world identities impacted avatar construction. In the next chapter, I analyze data from two “hardcore” fans of single-player v–RPGs using Morrowind as the representative gaming experience. How did their pre- existing proclivities for videogame identiﬁcation aid or hinder their connec- tions  to  their  diegetic  avatars?  In  chapter  four  I  analyze  data  from  a  more casual videogame player  one with no particular interest or experience with v–RPGs   using Oblivion.  Would  his  initial  lack  of  interest  in  open-ended avataristic  gameworld  exploration  lead  to  more  division  than  merger?  In chapter ﬁve I examine the gaming experiences of a non-gamer, someone who thinks  videogames  are  “a  waste  of  time.”  What  happens  when  this  person plays Fallout 3? Does she identify at all with her avatar? Stay tuned. I turn now in chapter three to a more detailed discussion of the ﬁrst of these v–RPGs: Morrowind. In this chapter I describe the challenges of collecting videogame data and provide background information on the two “hardcore” gamers who participated in this portion of the study. I also share their Morrowind gam- ing  experiences  and  provide  analysis  of  their  diegetic  decisions  related  to identity construction.   3  Morrowind  Identity and the Hardcore Gamer  Computer games are perhaps the richest cultural genre we have yet seen, and this challenges our search for a suitable methodological approach.  — Espen Aarseth, videogame theorist, 2001  All in all, these were happy times, exploring, ﬁghting, and pearl-diving, in a vast landscape ﬁlled with countless others. I even learned to ﬂy.  — Aarseth describing his experience playing Morrowind, 2003  How do the virtual identities of avatars in v–RPGs get constructed? Is there a relationship between real-world identity, virtual identity, and projec- tive identity? If there is, how can we study it? As Aarseth’s ﬁrst epigraph to this  chapter  suggests,  selecting  an  appropriate  methodology  to  effectively study videogames is not easy. This is partly because of the relative newness of the videogame theory ﬁeld; too few detailed studies have yet taken place in  a  discipline  still  deciding  on  terminologies  and  theoretical  approaches. Another  reason  designing  methodology  for  the  study  of  videogames  is  challenging  is  the  multimedia  aspect  of  videogaming  experiences.  Wolf explains:  The main reason for the [theoretical] neglect of the video game is that it is more difﬁcult to study than traditional media. The video game as a text is much harder to master.... Instead of ﬁxed, linear sequences of text, image, or sound which remain unchanged when examined mul- tiple times, a video game experience can vary widely from one playing to another. More time is needed to experience a video game. Some- times it is not even clear how many choices a player has, and discov- ery of alternate narrative paths is also a part of game play [7].  Wolf ’s observation is directly applicable to v–RPGs which are arguably the most problematic genre of videogame to study due to exactly the challenges Wolf describes: open-ended gameplay makes every user’s experience unique, with many gameplay variables contributing to the immersive and potentially identiﬁcatory  experience.  What  methodological  approach  best  enables  a  48   3. Morrowind  49  researcher to answer the questions about identities I ask at the beginning of this chapter?  Videogame theorist Kurt Squire suggests that “the study of games and learning might begin with qualitative study of game players”  4 . I heartily agree, and after studying the research design suggestions of Norman Denzin, Yvonna Lincoln, and John Creswell, I decided on a qualitative, phenomeno- logical research approach.1 Creswell identiﬁes several key theoretical terms important  to  a  phenomenological  approach.  Among  these  is  the  notion  of intentionality of consciousness “where experiences contain both the outward appearance and inward consciousness based on memory, image, and mean- ing.”  Intentionality  of  consciousness  assumes  a  refusal  of  subject object dichotomies: “The reality of an object is only perceived within the meaning of the experience of an individual”  53 . Following Husserl’s work, Creswell also  suggests  that  a  phenomenological  approach  “suspends  all  judgments about what is real until they are founded on a more certain basis”  52 . If phenomenological approaches suspend judgment on “reality” and refuse tra- ditional dichotomies, then my study  exploring the tensions and connections between virtual and real identities via videogame play  is certainly phenom- enological in nature.  Creswell points out when selecting participants for a phenomenological study purposeful sampling is crucial: “It is essential that all participants expe- rience the phenomenon being studied”  118 . Therefore, for this ﬁrst portion of my study, I selected two participants who had a high probability of being able to identify strongly with their avatars. This meant selecting participants who already identiﬁed themselves as “hardcore gamers”: people who enjoyed playing videogames and did so often for enjoyment and immersion. I also selected gamers who enjoyed the role-playing genre of videogames, and who were  used  to  manipulating  the  complex  mouse-and-keyboard  interface  of personal  computing  v–RPGs  because  I  did  not  want  differing  levels  of videogame and computer literacy to be an impediment to these two partici- pants being able to immerse themselves in the gameplay experience or keep them from identifying with their avatar. Therefore, I only selected partici- pants for this portion of my study with very high levels of videogame liter- acy for whom the interface could “disappear” fairly quickly  even as each new videogame  requires  a  learning  curve  to  master  the  control  scheme .  After preliminarily considering several different candidates, I selected the follow- ing two participants for this portion of the study:2 Vishnu, a 26-year-old Cau- casian male and a recent college graduate with a B.A. in English Literature, and Shiva, a 23-year-old Caucasian female university library assistant, also a recent college graduate with a B.S. in Biology.3 Vishnu and Shiva described themselves as being avid videogamers for most of their lives. In preliminary   50  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  interviews both participants demonstrated they met the necessary criteria to participate in this study as “hardcore” gamers.  Participant Gaming Histories  Vishnu  described  himself  as  a  life-long  videogame  player:  “I’ve  been gaming actually almost as long as I can remember. My dad got his ﬁrst degree in computing and he always had gadgets and computers and stuff [at home] before I was even born.” Vishnu explained that his brother also inﬂuenced him as a videogamer: “[My] older brother [was] a big part of it. He’s two and a half years older so as he was starting to get into gaming, you know, I was also. I’m going to do whatever my brother is doing! Simultaneously we had a computer, Coleco, Atari, and the TRS 80.” Vishnu speculated that his ﬁrst experiences playing videogames at home began when he was four or ﬁve. Soon the Nintendo Entertainment System  NES  was added to his family’s collection of videogame console systems, and Vishnu was gaming not only with his brother and father, but also with other children in the neighborhood:  VISHNU: We all went over to each other’s houses to play Contra, and RBI  Baseball,  all  that  good  stuff.  So  I’ve  been  a  gamer,  pretty much, my entire life.  ZACH: For all of your conscious memories. VISHNU: Yeah, have been gaming memories.  Vishnu’s  history  as  a  videogame  player  extends  as  far  back  as  his  earliest memories.  The  social  inﬂuences  on  his  interest  as  a  videogame  player  are clear, with his brother and father playing pivotal roles in his initiation into videogames.  Vishnu  expressed  a  desire  to  play  videogames  several  times  a week, but since becoming employed as an ofﬁce manager for a major airline and recently getting married, he admitted to having less free time to devote to playing videogames. These variables had reduced his videogame play to just once or twice a week. Vishnu did admit to videogame play binges, how- ever: “Sometimes I go on kicks where I play for three straight days, I’ll play ten hours a day.” During this study Vishnu gamed sporadically and in spurts when windows of opportunity presented themselves.  Like  Vishnu,  Shiva  has  been  playing  videogames  for  most  of  her  life.  Shiva described her introduction and instant attraction to videogames:  I started gaming so young! I think my earliest memory was when I was playing at my friend’s house when I was eight; I think we were play- ing Super Mario Bros. 2. I remember, I played with them once, and it was just so much fun and so new. I was like, “I want to play more!” I drove  my  friends  nuts;  I  would  go  over  to  their  house  and  play videogames quite often.   3. Morrowind  51  Shiva  was  hooked,  but  had  to  wait  until  she  was  ten  to  be  able  to  play videogames in her own home, when her parents bought an NES for Shiva and her  brother  to  share.  With  the  NES  in  the  home,  Shiva  admitted  that  she gamed every day, but had to compete with her younger brother for playing time on the system, leading to some of the biggest ﬁghts she can ever remem- ber having with her sibling. Like Vishnu, much of Shiva’s early gaming expe- riences  involved  her  brother  and  her  father,  who  also  liked  to  spend  time gaming. Shiva recalled early frustrations when her father monopolized the NES: “A lot of times my dad would game, and he’d be like, ‘I’m playing,’ and I’m like, ‘No, it’s not your turn!’ and he’d say, ‘Go do your chores.’” Despite this continual household competition for gaming time, Shiva continued to game throughout her years in school and now that she is employed as a uni- versity library assistant she speculated she has increased her videogame play: “I think I do it  gaming  more now since I have more free time. In school I got  busier.  I  would  [have]  liked  to  do  it  daily  but  sometimes  there  wasn’t time. I still stuck it in as much as I could.” During this study, Shiva gamed several times a week.  Both Vishnu and Shiva have a life-long passion for playing videogames that I felt was crucial to this portion of my study. But it was just as impor- tant that both participants’ love of videogames did not keep them from see- ing that all videogames are not created equally wonderfully; they have high expectations for their videogame experiences and weren’t shy in ﬁnding fault with games that didn’t hold their interest. Vishnu complained that he is con- tinually less impressed with new video games: “Perhaps the fact that I’m get- ting older and I see through some of the tricks they pull. Also, most games are just so redundant. I’ve done it [all] a hundred times before.” As an exam- ple,  Vishnu  cited  videogames  set  in  the Star  Wars universe.  Although  he admits to being a big fan of all things Star Wars, Vishnu explained he was tired of “playing the level of Hoth. I can’t tie up those AT-AT walkers any more. I’ve done it.”4 He also complained about the predictability of ﬁrst-per- son shooter  FPS  games, saying the lack of innovation in the genre kept the gameplay from being very rewarding. Shiva also expressed frustration with the redundancy of many videogame experiences, complaining that too many role-playing games “feel like they get old, like very similar, like [the] Final Fantasy [series]. I’ve played them all, but I’ve never [ﬁnished] them because I get to the point where I just, eh  shrugs shoulders .” Both Vishnu and Shiva enjoy becoming immersed in video games but this doesn’t happen automat- ically; enjoyable game play and innovation seem necessary.  Of course, what constitutes “enjoyable” game play is variable from user to  user.  What  speciﬁc  gaming  preferences  made  Vishnu  and  Shiva  good matches for the initial portion of this study? First, both participants stressed   52  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  the  importance  of  narrative  as  integral  to  videogaming  immersion.  When asked what the qualiﬁcation was for an enjoyable and immersive videogame experience,  Vishnu  replied,  “I  don’t  know!  Something  that’s  not  easily described. It’s gotta be engaging. You know, I look for a good story.” Later, when explaining what separated good role-playing games from “lousy” ones, Vishnu said, “I think narratives. There is much more empathizing in role- playing games and I think it takes on even more importance in that [type of ] game. The good narratives, there is something interesting happening, I’ll for- give a lot of other ﬂaws— graphically or gameplay — if the narrative is there.” Shiva  expressed  a  similar  attitude  about  the  importance  of  narrative  in videogames admitting that many of the ﬁghts she had with her brother grow- ing up that revolved around videogames had to do with the plots of the game they were playing. He would play further ahead in the game and then reveal crucial plot elements to Shiva, which she hated. Shiva, like Vishnu, also indi- cated a willingness to overlook certain gameplay weaknesses if she is inter- ested in a videogame’s narrative: “If the gameplay is kind of bad, like maybe I don’t like the system as well, but the story’s really good, I’ll get past it; I’ll work  past  it.”  An  interesting  narrative  had  been  a  key  component  of videogame engagement for both Vishnu and Shiva prior to their Morrowind experiences for this project.  As mentioned earlier, it was important that these two participants have a high level of videogame literacy so that the Morrowind gaming system would not  be  an  impediment  to  the  user  accessing  the  gaming  world.  Like  many v–RPGs, Morrowind has a complex interface, requiring the user to manipu- late  the  computer  mouse  with  one  hand  and  the  keyboard  with  the  other  with as many as 30 different keys potentially needed to control the avatar . PC gaming interfaces are typically more complex than console gaming inter- faces; playing Morrowind on an Xbox with an Xbox controller requires the manipulation of less than half as many buttons as the PC version. Both Vishnu and Shiva had experience gaming on both platforms  PCs and consoles , but Shiva in particular expressed an enthusiasm for PC role-playing games: “I like to play more complicated [RPGs] on the computer, because you can have more  complicated  goals  with  the  key  commands,  when  it  is  a  little  more difﬁcult.” Shiva clearly enjoys the challenge of mastering complicated gam- ing interfaces. Vishnu, on the other hand, admitted to a predisposition toward the gaming controllers of console systems:  Part of my bias is growing up with controllers and paddles; I’ve always had a control pad. Whenever I go and game with a mouse, to me it’s awk- ward. I don’t like the wrist positioning. I think the [console] controller for me is just very comfortable though I’ve been trying more [recently] with PC games to get more comfortable with using the buttons.   3. Morrowind  53  Motivated by the purchase of a new PC with more computing power, Vishnu  had  recently  been  doing  more  PC  gaming  than  console  gaming,  thus increasing his PC gaming literacy. To maintain a consistency of inter- face  for  this  portion  of  the  study  both  participants  played  Morrowind on  PCs.  The gaming interface represents the extra-diegetic part of a videogame system; diegetic parts of gaming systems can be just as complicated. Under- standing the rules is essential for any game if the user wants to play the game effectively. In videogames “playing effectively” usually means winning. This might include winning a football game in Madden ’08, killing all your oppo- nents on a Halo 3 map, or completing the narrative of an adventure game  freeing  Atrus  in  Myst,  discovering  who  the  serial  killer  is  in  Still  Life,  or helping  Kate  Walker  ﬁnd  her  way  to Syberia .  Most  genres  of  videogames have simple linear parameters for winning and effective gameplay. However, Morrowind is much more open-ended and the strategies for effective game- play vary enormously depending on each situation and the type of avatar the user chooses to play. Due to the many ways Morrowind can be “effectively” played this genre of videogame requires a much deeper understanding of the complexities  of  the  game  system  and  this  understanding  can  only  come through  trial  and  error  over  time  spent  in  the  gameworld.  Not  every videogamer has the patience for this type of videogame.5 Therefore, it was crucial  that  Vishnu  and  Shiva  enjoy  not  only  playing Morrowind but  also ﬁguring out how to play Morrowind effectively. In chapter two, I provided the following statement made by McMahon: “The player is caught up in the world of the game’s story  the diegetic level , but [immersion] also refers to the  player’s  love  of  the  game  and  the  strategy  that  goes  into  it   the  non- diegetic  level .”  Vishnu  in  particular  professed  a  love  for  the  non-diegetic aspects of immersion when asked why he likes playing v–RPGs: “I guess the obvious answer is entertainment, [but] I like learning the rules of the game and learning how the game operates. I guess it’s something about ﬁguring out the rules, and exploiting them. Or at least, doing well with them.... There’s something about that, learning and even mastering the system. I like ﬁgur- ing out the system of the game.” Vishnu admitted that he likes puzzles and puzzle-solving within videogames and it is clear that he considers learning the game system of videogames to be an extra-diegetic puzzle. This only aids his videogaming immersion. Although she did not directly mention the non- diegetic  gaming  system  in  explaining  why  she  enjoys  videogames,  Shiva’s above quote about enjoying mastering complex key commands suggests an interest similar to Vishnu’s. Shiva readily admitted that videogames contain- ing puzzles and problem-solving were among her most memorable gaming experiences, and she often found the sub-quests and mini-games as enjoy-   54  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  able as the main quests. Her fascination with a mini-game involving cook- ing in Star Ocean 2 illustrated this:  SHIVA:  I  usually  like  sub-games,  like  cooking,  or  something.  I  get  involved with that.  ZACH: What game has a cooking contest? You’ve referenced that a cou- ple of times, there must be something you played that sticks with you.  SHIVA: Star Ocean 2. I played that a long time ago and I played it sev- eral times and every single time you get to a certain part where you can do cooking and I never get past that part, because I love cooking too much to go past [it].  In this example, Shiva was willing to forego the game’s main narrative and spend her time instead on Star Ocean 2’s sub-quests. Like Vishnu, Shiva listed puzzles, numerous quests, and a good story as her three favorite components of videogames.  In keeping with their interests in puzzle-solving and character develop- ment, both participants also emphasized that one of the aspects of v–RPGs they liked the best was not feeling as if they were “on the clock” to make deci- sions. Shiva explained why she preferred v–RPGs to FPS games: “It just seems like, with Halo, you’re always shooting, always running, always dying. I play games  that  are  a  little  slower  [paced].”  Vishnu  agreed,  admitting  that  he wouldn’t enjoy playing fast-paced shooters and sports games if he wasn’t able to hit the “Pause” button on his computer whenever he needed to. One of the aspects of v–RPGs he likes best, Vishnu said, is that they allow you to “think about the repercussions of your actions.” This internal reﬂection is also cru- cial to identity formation, as I discussed in chapter two.  I argued in chapter one that v–RPGs are distinguished from other gen- res of videogames through the continual development of avatars. Therefore, it was also essential that Vishnu and Shiva enjoy the character development inherent to playing Morrowind. Shiva stressed that customizing and devel- oping her avatar was in fact the component of role-playing games she enjoyed the most: “I like leveling up, I like changing my character. It’s unique!” Vishnu also explained that character development was one of the main reasons he plays v–RPGs: “I like character development. The customization of charac- ters is something that I get more and more into.... With [the] customization, I like that because it lends itself to, like, personality.” Vishnu’s reply here is interesting as in it he directly connects avatar construction to “personality.” Personality is a term that is closely tied to real-world self-identity.  Finally, it was important to select participants for the Morrowind por- tion of this study who could become immersed in their avatars and who had a history of and proclivity for videogaming identiﬁcation. Both Vishnu and   3. Morrowind  55  Shiva expressed these characteristics in a few ways. I asked both participants to talk about some of their most memorable gaming experiences. In the games Shiva mentioned  such as Thunder and Lightning and Galerians: Ash  she had beaten them  completed the games’ levels and story  before her brother or her father. Shiva admires both male members of her family and seeks posi- tive  attention  from  them  constantly.  Shiva’s  gaming  identiﬁcation  in  these instances  was  clearly  tied  to  her  real-world  identity  and  relationships:  the games she remembered playing were ones where she had displayed more gam- ing skill than her brother and father and thus earned their real-world respect. Vishnu revealed similar connections, listing Final Fantasy VII as among his most memorable experiences:  Final Fantasy VII was a huge one! It might have to do with the age that I played it, I was seventeen maybe, and there was a pretty strong love story going on, and there was you know this whole, [as] if he was that kind of teenager too. There was a lot of identiﬁcation, with the char- acter, with the story going on. It just really clicked for me.  Here, Vishnu’s real-world identity  a teenaged boy  identiﬁed strongly with the virtual teenaged boy of the gameworld. Vishnu also cited Super Mario Bros. as being “seminal” in his gaming experiences and tried to explain why: “I think it’s sort of who I was at the time I was playing the game. I was like eight and my brothers were always playing it and I was trying to get in so I really wanted to play the game. I was like, ‘Let me play, let me play!’” Like Shiva, Vishnu had to compete for videogame playing time at home. In both of these instances Vishnu’s real-world identities contributed to making his videogame experiences memorable.  Both participants also made statements that hinted at a blurring of the line  between  their  real-world  and  virtual  world  identiﬁcations.  One  of Vishnu’s  favorite  videogames  is  Madden,  the  popular  professional  football series  a new edition comes out each year with up-to-date rosters and play- ers for each National Football League team . Vishnu attempted to describe the sense of accomplishment he felt when compiling gaudy statistics for his customized virtual quarterback:  ZACH: Is feedback one of the key reasons you play videogames? VISHNU: I think so. Like Madden for example, something that is cus- tomized to me like where it gives stats; my quarterback does this; that’s me; I did that. I threw 50 touchdowns, whatever, and it’s almost  in  a  strange  way  like  I  accomplished  something,  you know, even though I didn’t. I know that it’s not me and yet still, games allow you to sort of lose that.  Vishnu’s statement here seems to indicate confusion, or at least a tension, between  his  real-world  identity  and  his  virtual  identity   Vishnu’s Madden   56  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  quarterback . Here, Vishnu admits that it was not him accomplishing these virtual feats. This raises an interesting question: who was it then, if it was not Vishnu? Vishnu seems willing to discount the validity of the experiences of his virtual identity after the fact. Why does he do this, when the experi- ence was so real to him while experiencing it? This question is an important one, and one I will return to in chapter six.  Vishnu also provided evidence of a time when his virtual gaming expe- riences continued to affect him in the “real” world. Grand Theft Auto III was the  top  selling  videogame  of  2001 and  has  spawned  ﬁve  equally  successful sequels  at  the  time  of  this  writing.  In  the  game’s  virtual  Liberty  City,  the user’s  avatar  can  carjack,  murder,  steal,  solicit  prostitutes  and  drive  reck- lessly in freeform fashion; the open-ended gameplay and kairotic temporal- ity leave these choices up to the user. Vishnu remembered vividly the ﬁrst time he played Grand Theft Auto III and described the impact it had on him:  VISHNU:  The  ﬁrst  time  I  played  it  I  was  just  sitting  in  my  brother’s house and just hangin’ out. I’d watched for about a half hour and played for about a half hour. And I got in my car, I’m waiting at a stoplight, and I just, I felt really compelled to just peel out and you know, with just no regard for the trafﬁc, cross the light. That [game] really had a response, a response within me.  ZACH: Did you have to consciously say to yourself, I can’t do that, I  shouldn’t do that?  VISHNU:  Yeah!  It  was  very  surprising  to  me,  a  little  bit  disturbing.  I  really felt compelled, almost, to do that.  After having spent very little time  30 minutes watching, 30 minutes play- ing  in Liberty City, Vishnu’s passage from his virtual identity in a virtual world to his real-world identity when driving his car took a little time. This lag time he experienced is fascinating and reveals the presence of liminal space between  the  virtual  and  real-world  identities:  Gee’s  projective  identity.  In this particular instance for Vishnu, the passage out of virtual space was not instantaneous.  Shiva seemed less convinced that her videogaming experiences had ever directly impacted her real-world identity. When I asked her if she thought videogaming experiences had ever changed her life, she replied, “I don’t know. The games I play are so fantastical that I don’t really relate them to real life.... I mean, I play [some] games that it’s like real where you’re trapped in a cas- tle and there are these maniacs coming after you, that could be real.” This statement  demonstrates  what  appears  to  be  an  unconscious  connection between fantasy and reality. Being hunted by maniacs in a castle, although possible, seems pretty far down the fantastical end of the “reality” contin- uum. The chances of having this experience in a virtual setting are far greater   3. Morrowind  57  than encountering it in the real world. Shiva’s statement here may provide evidence  that  the  many  virtual  videogame  experiences  she’s  had  over  the course of her life  where monsters and madmen appear with much greater frequency than they do in the real world  may have inﬂuenced her more than she is willing to admit or is consciously aware of. The following statement from Vishnu typiﬁed both participants’ gaming experience: “I’ve been gam- ing  actually  almost  as  long  as  I  can  remember.”  Both  participants  enjoyed playing v–RPGs yet neither of them had yet played Morrowind, making them ideal for participation in this portion of my study.  Videogame Selection: Why Morrowind?  Selecting the videogames for this study was enormously important: what videogames would best provide opportunities for the real-world identities of users and the virtual identities of their avatars to inform each other? As my discussion in chapter one suggested, I believe that only the role-playing genre of videogame offers the opportunity to construct true avatars  in the purest sense of the word  as opposed to mere agents that can only be controlled, but never altered or shaped. I selected Bethesda Softworks’ The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind as the representative v–RPG for this portion of the study.6 Mor- rowind was one of the most popular video games of 2002, winning several critical and popular awards. Perhaps most crucial to this study, Morrowind’s avatarial construction opportunities are continual and many. At the outset, Morrowind allows the user to select the name of the avatar, the gender  male or female , and race. Ten different races exist in Vvardenfell  the island set- ting  of  the  game,  within  the  larger  world  known  as  Morrowind .  Four  of these races are humanoid  Nord, Redguard, Breton, and Imperial , three are elven  Dark Elf, High Elf, and Wood Elf  , and the other three are more ani- malistic  in  appearance   the  reptilian  Argonian,  the  feline  Khajiit,  and  the porcine Orc . Each race has predetermined values in the eight character attrib- utes: strength, intelligence, willpower, agility, speed, endurance, personality, and luck. Attributes like these  and often these very eight  are canonical in v–RPGs  and  the  variability  in  choosing  which  of  these  attributes  will  be strongest  and  which  weakest  for  the  avatar  is  an  essential  characteristic  of strategic gameplay in role-playing games. Each race offers a limited number of facial and hairstyle options the user can pick from when deciding on their avatar’s appearance. Races also receives a bonus to particular skills based on that race’s inherent abilities and attributes. For example, Khajiit characters receive a 15 point bonus to the Acrobatics skill  since Khajiit have a very high natural agility . Like the attributes, customizable skills that can be improved over the course of the gaming experience are central to video role-playing   58  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  games. Morrowind offers 27 different skills, designed to help the avatar inter- act  with  the  gameworld  via  physical  combat   Axe,  Block,  Blunt  Weapon, Hand-to-hand, Heavy Armor, Light Armor, Long Blade, Marksman, Medium Armor,  Short  Blade,  Spear,  and  Unarmored ,  magic   Alchemy,  Alteration, Conjuration,  Destruction,  Enchant,  Illusion,  Mysticism,  and  Restoration , or non-combative means  Acrobatics, Armorer, Athletics, Mercantile, Secu- rity,  Speechcraft,  and  Sneak .  All  skills  have  a  rating  between  5   very unskilled  and 100  mastery of the skill . Skills can be improved simply by repeatedly using them in the gameworld  e.g., using a spear in combat will gradually improve your “Spear” skill rating . Each time the avatar increases ten  total  skill  points  from  among  their  Major  Skills,7 “leveling  up”  occurs and  the  user  can  improve  three  attributes  by  one  point  each.  Within  the v–RPG genre, Morrowind allows each user a great range of freedom to select the skills and attributes they are most interested in when constructing their avatar both at the beginning of the game and throughout the duration of the gameplay experience.  It was also important to me to select a single-player only v–RPG for this  and each  stage of the project; Morrowind is such a game. The user inter- acts  in  the  game  world  only  with  pre-established  NPCs;  Morrowind is  not played online with other “real-world” users like in popular MMORPGs like World of Warcraft and Everquest. I have not selected MMORPGs for my study because identity construction in this type of v–RPG is more problematic and unpredictable.  Janet  Murray  also  explains  why  she  prefers  single-player v–RPGs to MMORPGs: “Collective fantasy can be fraught with problems. [Online gamers] tend to ﬁght with one another both in and out of charac- ter.  Wizards  and  gods  can  eavesdrop,  reassign  treasure,  and  kill  or  revive players. Because of the improvised nature of [online gaming], a lot of time is spent in negotiating appropriate [social] behavior rather than in story mak- ing”  150–51 . In a MMORPG, there is great potential for the user’s immer- sive identiﬁcation with their avatar and the gameworld to be complexiﬁed and potentially disrupted by factors outside their control: the behaviors of other users. In a single-player v–RPG like Morrowind, the potential for these external variables disappear, as the gameworld system is “closed” in a sense. The user’s level of identiﬁcation with their avatar is reliant only on the immer- sive  properties  of Morrowind’s  programming  and  the  user’s  own  decisions within the game’s spaces. This reduction in unpredictable non-diegetic vari- ables enacts a measure of control over the experiences of the participants, and allows these experiences to be compared and contrasted as I attempt to dis- cover the relationships between their real-world identities and their virtual identities. Certainly, MMORPGs offer many opportunities for socialization and  community-building;  much  scholarship  exists  on  these  aspects  of   3. Morrowind  59  MMORPGs.8 However, I believe single-player v–RPGs offer better opportu- nities to speciﬁcally study the connections between virtual identity and real- world identity via projective identity.  Morrowind is also a good choice for this study because it follows RPG generic standards by having an archetypal plot and a fantasy setting. Ryan identiﬁes the archetypal plot of the role-playing genre in describing the “quest of the hero across a land ﬁlled with many dangers to defeat evil forces and conquer a desirable object”  13 . Certainly the main quest  or central narra- tive  in Morrowind ﬁts this description well. The Morrowind Prophecies, the ofﬁcial guide to Morrowind, offers the following summary of the game’s main plot:  In an earlier era, Lord Nerevar, the great hero of the Dunmer people  as  Morrowind’s  native  Dark  Elves  call  themselves ,  defeated  the Dwarves and their ally, the Dunmer traitor Dagoth Ur, in a great bat- tle at Red Mountain. But Dagoth Ur somehow survived, and, dwelling in darkness under the volcano, he lusts for revenge. Technically, he is imprisoned.  The  Tribunal  Temple   essentially,  the  church  of  Mor- rowind   ringed  the  volcano’s  crater  with  magical  wards   the  Ghost- fence . [But] the Ghostfence has begun to fail. Dagoth Ur’s minions roam  the  ashy  wastes  around  the  volcano.  Nerevar  lost  his  own  life defeating  Dagoth  Ur.  The  earthly  gods  of  the  Tribunal  Temple  have retreated from the ﬁeld, and the Temple suppresses as heresy the hope- ful belief in a prophesied resurrection of Nerevar. The Great Houses and the Guilds are busy ﬁghting one another, or simply indifferent to the  threat.  This  is  where  you  come  in.  You  are  the  prophesied  hero behind whom the land might unite [1].  Of course, at the start of the game, the avatar is unaware of any of this, having been unceremoniously released from prison by the Emperor and sent by ship to the small ﬁshing town of Seyda Neen, where the avatar is instructed to deliver a package of documents to Caius Cosades in Balmora and receive further orders there. However, the user can deliver the package to Cosades in Balmora or not: the avatar is free to go anywhere in the gameworld at any time and need never follow the steps needed to complete the main quest if they so desire. Unlike so many other genres of videogame, Morrowind users do not have time constraints or pressures placed upon them.  Without time constraints, Morrowind users have the luxury of reﬂect- ing on and learning from their decisions, which many faster-paced genres of videogames do not allow for. Gunther Kress deﬁnes learning as “the process of inward meaning-making and the resultant change to the state of an inner semiotic resource”  40  stressing the need for “reﬂection, for assessment, for the  quiet  moment  of  consideration  and  review”   174 .  Even  as  Kress  con- cedes that “the process of outward meaning-making also has a transforma-   60  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  tive  effect”   174   he  clearly  believes  that  being  able  to  reﬂect  internally  is essential to learning. The identity theorists discussed in chapter two would doubtless agree, as the “self ” needs time to consider how to not only iden- tify with a given stimuli, but also how to make sense of the interaction in terms of the ongoing internal narratives necessary for self-identity. Without time  for  reﬂection,  no  learning  can  take  place,  and  identity  cannot  be  re formed. Morrowind’s meaning-making and learning potential is integral to the identiﬁcatory possibilities of the gaming experience.  To understand how time functions in Morrowind, it is helpful to think about time in terms of chronos and kairos. Chronos refers to measurable, quantitative time: “the speciﬁc time or duration of some event or action as conceived in terms of a socially agreed-upon temporal measure”  Yates 108 . In contrast, kairos is a qualitative term referring to the “opportune or appro- priate moment to perform an action”  108 . But is kairos objectively given or humanly constructed? Theorists have been divided on the issue, but Miller  1992  suggests a third option encompassing both views: kairos as a dynamic interplay between objective and subjective. Kairotic moments may present themselves to vigilant rhetors, but in turn rhetors can craft a kairotic moment as well. Both avenues are possible.  Temporality in Morrowind demonstrates the cooperative relationship of kairos and chronos quite well; this is an important reason I selected the game for this study. As mentioned, there is a linear story  the main quest  that can be  followed.  Accomplishing  each  of  the  24  essential  tasks   many  of  these requiring substantial time and sub-tasks to complete  will progress the sto- ryline presenting a kairotic moment  an appropriate time to act . However, how far apart these staged kairotic moments are from each other in terms of chronos is variable. In Morrowind, gamers are free to wander Vvardenfell as they please, potentially never taking on the main narrative spine  and thus missing out on these pre-established kairotic moments . The chronos of the game time runs continually regardless: days and nights pass within the game world regardless of the player’s actions. Does this mean a user who chooses not  to  undertake  main  quests   those  crucial  to  advancing  the  Dagoth Ur Nerevar storyline  cannot ﬁnd kairotic moments within the game? No: spontaneous kairotic moments still abound because of the many dozens of side quests and random encounters with NPCs that can be found in Mor- rowind  there are literally hundreds of NPCs and mini-quests to discover .9 Each time, the user faces a kairotic moment: should they have their avatar attack the NPC in the distance with a sword? With a bow and arrow? With a magic spell? Should the avatar run away  or sneak by  and avoid an encounter? In a videogame, of course, users are freer to take chances. If the user attacks the NPC and the avatar is killed, perhaps the kairotic moment for ﬁghting   3. Morrowind  61  that NPC hasn’t yet arrived; maybe the avatar isn’t yet powerful enough. Or maybe the user just tried the wrong strategy. This can be explored by simply reloading the last saved game point and trying again. Through this trial and error method, kairotic moments in the game can be continually discovered. The game’s design gives the user control over time, in a sense: chronos con- tinually runs,10 but no kairotic moments will be missed — each waits stati- cally somewhere in Vvardenfell for the user to ﬁnd and trigger, and then retry if the outcome doesn’t meet their satisfaction  if the user is willing to reload their game from an earlier point . Just as importantly, Morrowind gameplay can be paused at any time, thus allowing the user as much time as needed to think about the gameplay experience: the reﬂection Kress identiﬁes as essen- tial to learning. Even when the game is not paused, Morrowind is still rela- tively  slow-paced,  with  more  time  devoted  to  exploring  Vvardenfell  and talking to NPCs than to combat.  As a result of the narrative freedom Morrowind allows, the user becomes a producer in the way that Murray and Humphreys have hypothesized, and is able to interact internally and ontologically with the game. Ryan explains that Morrowind is internally interactive in the sense that the avatar is a mem- ber  of  Vvardenfell,  not  outside  of  it   as  is  the  case  in  many  sandbox-type games or other “God” games11 . Morrowind is also interactive in an ontolog- ical sense because the user makes decisions that determine what story will emerge;  no  one  linear  narrative  must  be  followed.  With  this  dual  type  of interaction, “the user and the ﬁctional world produces a new life, and con- sequently a new life-story, with every run of the system”  Ryan 12 . I should also note here that Murray, citing Tobias’ guidebook for writers, provides a list of what she considers to be the twenty master plots that exist, correspon- ding to the basic patterns of human life  variations of desire, fulﬁllment, and loss, essentially : quest, adventure, pursuit, rescue, escape, revenge, the rid- dle, rivalry, underdog, temptation, metamorphosis, transformation, matu- ration, love, forbidden love, sacriﬁce, discovery, wretched excess, ascension, and descension  186–87 . Most narratives offer at least one of these, or per- haps a few. However, an examination of the quests and encounters listed as possible in The Morrowind Prophecies reveals that Morrowind offers users the opportunity to experience potentially all of these over the course of the game- play experience  depending, of course, on the exploratory path taken through Vvardenfell .  These  transformative  opportunities,  along  with Morrowind’s open-ended approach to narrativity, make it ideal for this study.  Another reason I selected Morrowind as the v–RPG for this study was the game’s space. In Hamlet on the Holodeck Murray identiﬁed four proper- ties of digital environments essential for allowing immersion. First, they must be procedural: the deﬁning ability of computers is to execute a series of rules   62  MY AVATAR, MY SELF   71 . In chapter two, I discussed computer users’ propensities to ascribe to computers more human characteristics and intelligence than they deserve. Morrowind has  a  complex  interface,  and  all  interactions  within  the  game- world  combat, conversation, bartering, lockpicking  are decided by statis- tical rules. For example, if the user’s avatar tries to pick the lock on a treasure chest, whether or not the attempt succeeds is determined by the Lockpick skill level of the avatar, the lock level of the chest  how complicated a lock it is , and the quality of the lockpick the avatar is using. All of these numbers are weighed against each other and the chance-to-open-the-lock-percentage is calculated  by  the  game’s  programming.  Of  course,  these  calculations  are opaque and happen instantaneously for the user. In this way, the user feels like the game is continually responding to their input. This is Murray’s sec- ond essential property: the digital environment must be participatory. My dis- cussion  of  Morrowind’s  open-ended  gameplay  and  freedom  in  avatarial construction  earlier  in  this  chapter  demonstrate  the  highly  participatory nature of Morrowind. The procedural and participatory properties of  Mor- rowind are what make it interactive for users in Murray’s terms.  Murray’s third essential property for digital environments is that they be spatial: they must represent navigable space  79 . In chapter two, Aarseth, Flynn, Murray, and Taylor stressed the importance of space in videogames, particularly in relation to point of view, labyrinthine structures, and walk- able navigation. The island of Vvardenfell in Morrowind is vast: The Mor- rowind Prophecies Ofﬁcial Guide breaks the island down into eighteen distinct regions,  providing  a  detailed  map  for  each  region.  The  smallest  of  these regions highlights the town of Seyda Neen  located on the southwest coast of  Vvardenfell   and  the  region  around  the  town.  Despite  this  map’s  small size, twenty-three different spots of interest are listed, many of these tombs, caves, grottos, and buildings that each have their own internal labyrinthine maps.  To  explore  even  this  small  region  of  Vvardenfell  thoroughly  would take a user several hours of chronos time. The guide lists 812 total spots of interest in the eighteen different regions of Vvardenfell. Morrowind places the avatar on foot; therefore, walking is the primary means of navigation through Vvardenfell. This supports Flynn’s theories of immersion and navigation in digital spaces. Much of Vvardenfell’s terrain is rhizomatic as well, with the avatar free to wander from any point to any other point  albeit not instan- taneously  as  the  world  is  “ﬂat” .  However,  all  caves,  grottos,  tombs,  and  buildings  are  single-path  mazes   with  many  of  these  requiring  extensive exploration as well . Morrowind, therefore, offers several different types of navigable  space.  Just  as  importantly,  Morrowind allows  the  user  to  choose either ﬁrst-person or third-person point of view when navigating the game space, thus increasing the opportunities for immersive identiﬁcation within   3. Morrowind  63  the gaming experience, since each user is able to choose the point of view they prefer the most and ﬁnd most immersive.  Murray’s fourth essential property for a digital environment is that it must be encyclopedic, with the capacity to represent and contain vast quan- tities  of  information.  Few  v–RPGs  are  as  encyclopedic  as  Morrowind.  I’ve already mentioned the hundreds of NPCs in Vvardenfell who can be inter- acted with. Many will share information on a variety of topics: the history of  Vvardenfell,  rumors,  locations  of  interest,  creatures  to  be  avoided,  and more. Vvardenfell also contains many dozens of books that can be discov- ered  whether it be from the shelves of the towns’ libraries, from wizard tow- ers, or in the holds of shipwrecks  and read. Most of these books describe the histories and lands of Morrowind, over time providing extensive encyclope- dic knowledge about the gameworld. The spatial and encyclopedic natures of Morrowind work together to make the game immersive in Murray’s sense of the term.  For all of these reasons, Morrowind seemed like an excellent v–RPG to choose for this portion of the study. The game’s high customizability, narra- tive and temporal freedoms, vast navigable game space, and generic fantasy role-playing conventions allow great potential for immersion and avatarial identiﬁcation. I collected data for this study in the following ways. First, each participant  played  ten  hours  of  Morrowind;  this  gameplay  was  recorded directly onto an external hard drive. After compressing this raw audio visual data down into smaller ﬁle sizes, the gameplay data was moved onto DVDs. I then transcribed the diegetic decisions of each participant  see the appen- dix for a complete transcription example  and analyzed this transcription to pinpoint crucial decisions made by the avatar. Morrowind users make diegetic decisions continually; for my analysis I concentrated on diegetic decisions that were substantially and purposefully tied to the development of the avatar’s identity construction  in terms of ethics, narrativity, and attribute and skill development . I then used this transcription analysis to generate speciﬁc ques- tions about each participant’s Morrowind experience, and interviewed Shiva and Vishnu using these questions to guide the interviews. These follow-up interviews were then transcribed and analyzed to ascertain what connections existed between each user’s real-world identity and their virtual identity in Morrowind. I turn now to a description of both participants’ identiﬁcatory decisions and my analysis of those decisions.  Choosing the Avatar’s Name  In chapter one I provided the following question asked by Marie Ryan on the relationship between user and avatar in v–RPGs: “Will [the user] be   64  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  like an actor playing a role, innerly distanciated from her character and sim- ulating emotions she does not really have, or will she experience her charac- ter  in  ﬁrst-person  mode,  actually  feeling  [the  emotions]  that  motivate  the character’s behavior or that may result from her actions?”  6  This question, representing two ends of an identity continuum, is an important one: how “real” was each user’s identiﬁcation with their avatar? In Morrowind there are many opportunities for users to identify with their avatars. Each new game begins with a cinematic that provides minimal backstory for the avatar: the avatar has been mysteriously released from prison on the Emperor’s orders and sent on a slave ship to the small village of Seyda Neen for release. This explanatory  cinematic  takes  less  than  two  minutes,  and  then  the  avatar  is woken by a fellow prisoner, Jiub, in the hold of the slave ship. Jiub asks the avatar what her his name is. This is the ﬁrst opportunity for Morrowind users to begin constructing their avatar. How did Vishnu and Shiva decide on their avatars’ names?  “Steve!” was the name of Vishnu’s avatar. This choice was surprising. Vishnu was an experienced v–RPG gamer: he knew Morrowind was set in a fantasy world with monsters and non-humanoid races. I was expecting a less ordinary name inspired by Gandolf or Saruman  Lord of the Rings  or Bib Fortuna or Boba Fett  the Star Wars trilogy . Certainly not Steve!  Vishnu was adamant that the exclamation point was an important part of the name . Vishnu described his reasons for choosing this name: “It’s sort of a long-run- ning personal joke, really just with myself. For some reason I have this alter ego that I love, Steve Grabowski. It’s this great name.” Vishnu went on to explain the signiﬁcance of the name:  VISHNU: It actually comes from two places. Um, the [Simpsons] episode where Homer goes to New York to get his car back, after Barney takes it? It’s in between the World Trade Center. And he calls in to get the boot taken off his car, and the automated phone serv- ice  is  like,  “Your  request  has  been  denied  by  Ofﬁcer  Steve Grabowski.” And then I just thought that was really funny. And then in the movie Grosse Pointe Blank, she’s [Joan Cusack’s char- acter] talking about the hitmen that have been hired to assassi- nate John Cusack’s character and she, she, one of them is named like, “Steven La Poo Belle,” and she goes, “AKA, Steve!” and the way she said that, with an exclamation point, for some reason I just thought that was the world’s funniest thing, and ever since I use Steve Grabowski for all kinds of secret stuff.  ZACH: So it’s the kind of thing you do quickly for your own amusement. VISHNU: Yeah, pretty much. No one really would get it other than me.  Even though Vishnu did not select a name for his avatar that seemed in keep- ing with the fantasy RPG genre, the name did have personal, “secret” mean-   3. Morrowind  65  ing to him. Vishnu admitted that he had named his head coach in Madden 06 Steve! Grabowski. Vishnu’s choice for his virtual identity’s name in Mor- rowind was directly inﬂuenced by his real-world identity’s sense of humor and predisposition for a long-running personal joke. That he refers to Steve! Grabowski as an “alter-ego” shows his level of investment and identiﬁcation with the name and the persona it represents.  Shiva named her avatar “Shi.” I asked her to explain why: “I’m not cre- ative with naming and I feel this pressure to name it  the avatar  cool, but then I don’t know what’s cool. I feel like I want to name it something I like. And I like my own name a lot. Shi is my default name; I don’t know why. [Actu- ally] I guess I do: it’s me.” This reveals that Shiva’s real-world identity has primacy at this stage of the avatar’s creation: her virtual world identity shares her name. Morrowind’s decision to have users select the avatar name before selecting the race and gender is an interesting one: if the user hasn’t read the game manual to learn about what these choices entail, the name selection at the beginning of the game comes with almost no contextual diegetic data to aid the user. Users must rely on their extra-diegetic real-world identities when naming the avatar as Vishnu and Shiva have illustrated here.  Learning the Gaming Interface  After the avatar is named, Morrowind users are then allowed to begin moving around in the gameworld: a guard on the slave ship asks the avatar to follow him up from the storage hold to the main deck. As I discussed ear- lier in this chapter, it is important that the game’s interface become intuitive as quickly as possible so that the user can become immersed in diegetic aspects of the game. Here at the beginning of the game, the avatar is controlled in ﬁrst-person POV.12 Vishnu admitted that at ﬁrst it was “kind of tough” to learn Morrowind’s complex interface particularly when trying to control the Y-axis. To control the direction the avatar  and therefore the user  is looking within the gameworld the user must move the mouse up and down  the Y axis  and left and right  the X axis  corresponding to the movements of the avatar’s head. However, most videogames have a default Y axis setting similar to air- plane controls: pushing forward actually looks down and pulling the mouse backward looks up. This feature in particular bothered Vishnu, and in the ﬁrst ten minutes of his Morrowind gameplay, he entered the game’s Settings feature to examine the control scheme and experiment with the vertical axis seven different times. Thereafter, however, Vishnu was comfortable with the gaming interface:  After the ﬁrst ten minutes it was pretty good. Having gamed a lot, usu- ally one of the ﬁrst things I’ll do, I’ll go look at the controls and ﬁnd   66  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  out at least the major ones. In this instance I went and scrolled through the control list and as I started gaming I tweaked a little bit. After about an  hour  of  playing  I  was  [comfortable],  using  the  hot  keys,  reﬁning them, stuff like that.  That  it  took  Vishnu  ten  minutes  to  become  comfortable  with  the  gaming interface  is  a  tribute  to  his  gaming  acumen:  ten  minutes  is  a  very  short amount of time, especially for a v–RPG offering potentially hundreds of hours of  gameplay.  Shiva  was  more  comfortable  with  the  interface  immediately likely  due  to  her  more  extensive  experience  with  PC  gaming  interfaces. Describing  herself  as  “really  ﬂexible”  when  it  comes  to  gaming  interfaces, Shiva, in contrast to Vishnu, never entered the game’s Settings at any time during her Morrowind gameplay. She relied on the default game settings and the control settings reminder on the back of the game manual instead. The interface never interfered with Shiva’s Morrowind immersion.  Selecting Race and Gender  The next step in Morrowind’s avatar creation is selecting race and gen- der. The avatar is escorted off of the slave ship, where a waiting guard asks where she he is from. This triggers the racial and gender selection screen from which the user can select a male or female from any of the ten playable Mor- rowind races  with ten different facial and twenty different hair options for each . This selection screen defaults to a Dark Elf male. After examining all the racial options  spending more than ﬁve minutes to make his selection  Vishnu ultimately selected Dark Elf as the race for his avatar. Had he been inﬂuenced by this being the default race in the selection screen? When asked, he said that this had no bearing on his selection. He explained that his deci- sion was more tactical: “I know from other RPGs and stuff, usually Elves are quick, and they’re decent magic users, decent ﬁghters, so you know they have a  good  balance.  I  think  that’s  why  I  ended  up  taking  it.”  Vishnu  used  his knowledge of genres  both v–RPG genre and fantasy genre  to help him hone in on the three Elven races. He then relied on his love of “number crunch- ing” to examine the starting attributes of each race. A statistical examination reveals that the Dark Elves do indeed have the highest Speed value of any race  50, the highest initial value possible for any attribute  and also have strong starting values in Strength  40, important for ﬁghters  and Intelligence  40, important  for  magic  users .  Vishnu  relied  on  a  combination  of  diegetic knowledge  the speciﬁc attribute values for Dark Elves in Morrowind  and extra-diegetic knowledge  past experiences with Elven characters in v–RPGs and knowledge of Elven fantasy mythology  to select Steve!’s race.  Like  Vishnu,  Shiva  also  selected  Dark  Elf  for  Shi’s  race.  She  was   3. Morrowind  67  inﬂuenced  by  each  race’s  starting  attribute  values  to  a  certain  degree.  She also expressed a desire for a “balanced” character saying since she wasn’t sure whether combat or magic skills were going to be more beneﬁcial in the game, she “wanted to be able to do both.” However Shiva was inﬂuenced even more by her wish to identify with the avatar:  SHIVA: I wanted to choose a race that would match my stats,13 so I was trying  to  think,  and  I  usually  have  a  hard  time  choosing  the other-worldly races in role-playing games.  ZACH: So there was an Orc  porcine , there was a Khajiit, which was catlike,  and  there  was  the  Argonian  which  was  a  lizard.  Were those eliminated right off the bat?  SHIVA: Basically. ZACH: But of course the Dark Elf doesn’t look particularly human... SHIVA: It’s more human to me, I don’t know why. A lot of times I do a magic user that looks a lot like me and I wanted to get away from that a little bit.  ZACH: You wanted to get away from which one? SHIVA: Me always choosing something that looks like me. I was like, “I can just be different!” and that’s why I chose the Dark Elf. It was a bit about her appearance. I think I decided it was maybe a lit- tle bit different, but not too different. So I was going to be an Elf.  Shiva made a conscious effort to select a race for her avatar that was dif- ferent physically from her real-world identity. At the same time, she was care- ful  to  make  sure  that  the  avatar’s  racial  identity  would  not  be  so  different  animalistic in appearance  that she wouldn’t be able to identify with it. She seemed to ﬁnd a careful balance here between merger and division in con- necting Shi to her real-world identity.  To aid in the merger aspects of her avatarial identiﬁcation Shiva selected female for Shi’s gender. This selection, she said, was the easiest part of the selection process:  SHIVA: I’m female and I want to go with a female. I sometimes go male, but usually I’m like, there are enough male [avatars]. I’m female. I want it.  ZACH: So you want your avatar to be female and named Shi? SHIVA: Yes, basically me, I guess.  Shiva’s  desire  to  create  an  avatar  that  resembles  her  real-world  identity’s appearance was shown as she scrolled through the different races before decid- ing on Dark Elf. Shiva showed clear gender identiﬁcation: she was eager to play as a female. Historically most videogame avatars and agents have been male.  Shiva  exhibited  a  strong  feminist  identity  throughout  this  project, decrying the impossible physique of Tomb Raider’s Lara Croft and boycotting   68  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  Shiva’s avatar Shi, initial creation.  Grand  Theft  Auto  III because  of  the  degrading  depiction  of  women  in  the game.  Shiva  was  eager  to  create  a  female  avatar  that  she  could  roleplay  as strong and independent, characteristics she felt were too infrequently avail- able in female videogame characters. Ultimately, she chose between a red- headed Dark Elf female and a brunette Nord female  one of the human races . Shiva admitted that the Nord avatar she was considering was “me being ego- tistical, just being myself.” Ultimately she rejected this option partly due to her above-mentioned desire to try something “different” but also due to her inability to ﬁnd any Nord facial options that really looked like Shiva:  SHIVA: I didn’t like any of the [Nord] faces. All the faces were not that  great. And so, if you’re a Dark Elf, or some other race...  ZACH: It’s okay for it not to look real? SHIVA: Right, because you don’t know what’s [real]. But here  the Nord , it’s obviously not a good enough likeness. It’s not pretty enough.  For Shiva there was safety in selecting the Dark Elf since there is no physical reality against which to weigh its appearance. If the Morrowind avatar cre-   3. Morrowind  69  Vishnu’s avatar Steve!, initial creation.  ation system had been sophisticated enough to allow Shiva to create a Cau- casian  female  that  more  closely  resembled  her  real-world  appearance,  she likely would have done so given her stated desire to create avatars as similar to her extra-diegetic self as possible. Shiva’s selection of gender and race reveal an interesting paradox. She selected the avatar’s gender because it matched her  real-world  identity.  However  she  selected  the  avatar’s  race  because  it decidedly  did  not  match  her  real-world  identity.  Yet  both  selections  only strengthened her identiﬁcation with Shi. In an interview conducted after her Morrowind gameplay  Shiva  said  she  found  her  avatar  Shi  memorable  and stressed how much she liked the avatar. This example echoes Gee’s descrip- tion of his creation of his avatar Bead Bead: “a delicious blend”  54  of both merger and division leading to strong identiﬁcation with the virtual identity. This phenomenon is central to v–RPGs and I describe it further in chapter six.  Shiva’s desire to try something “different” with her avatar was mirrored by Vishnu, who also selected female for his Dark Elf. A female named Steve! was certainly unexpected but it was in keeping with Vishnu’s sense of humor and  desire  for  self-amusement.  He  admitted  that  he  didn’t  usually  choose   70  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  female avatars but that this time he decided to “do something a little differ- ent.” When asked why he normally selected male avatars, he replied that male avatars made identiﬁcation easier for him: “I guess part of it is that it is trans- ferring identity into the game. You want [the avatar] to kind of reﬂect your- self a little bit.” Vishnu attempted to create an avatar that physically looked like him before ultimately deciding that the closest possibility  in this case, a Caucasian Breton  wasn’t close enough. Vishnu did admit that he was able to create a Khajiit character that closely resembled his pet cat but decided that was an identiﬁcation he wasn’t willing to embrace for the duration of his Morrowind gameplay. Vishnu’s desire for a balanced character and willing- ness to try something different led him to select the Dark Elf female. Vishnu and Shiva, both heavily inﬂuenced by their real-world desires, selected Dark Elf female avatars.  Selecting Class and Skills  After the user selects race and gender, the avatar is escorted into Seyda Neen’s  Census  and  Excise  Ofﬁce,  where  the  next  phase  of  avatar  creation, class, takes place. Morrowind’s game manual describes “class” in the follow- ing way: “Class deﬁnes your way of life and which skills are most important to you”  Hines and Cheng 21 . In the Census and Excise Ofﬁce non-player character  NPC  Socucius Ergalla offers the user three ways to generate avatar class. First, she can select from the 21 pre-existing classes that exist in the game. Seven of these classes emphasize combat as the primary means of inter- acting with the game world, seven emphasize magic, and seven emphasize stealth. Users are free to select any one of these 21 from the list provided. Each of these 21 classes has ﬁve Major Skills and ﬁve Minor Skills associated with them. The second option allows the user to create their own custom class by choosing the Major and Minor skills they want to emphasize and naming this class.14 For the third class-generation option, Ergalla offers to ask the avatar a series of ten questions; he will then assign a class  from the 21 pre-existing classes  to the avatar based on the answers. Each question has three possible answers with each answer demonstrating a propensity for combat, magic, or stealth; combined, the ten answers will match one class given pre-established systemic parameters.15 However, each question is vague and it isn’t readily apparent what the answers might mean. The eighth question Ergalla asks rep- resents this ambiguity: “Your mother asks you to help ﬁx the stove. While you  are  working,  a  very  hot  pipe  slips  its  moorings  and  falls  towards  her. What do you do?” The user has three choices: “Position yourself between the pipe  and  your  mother,”  “Grab  the  hot  pipe  and  try  to  push  it  away,”  and “Push your mother out of the way”  The Morrowind Prophecies 7 . It’s impos-   3. Morrowind  71  sible  to  know  which  of  these  choices  the  game  designers  have  decided  is related to combat, magic, and stealth. This adds an element of surprise to the avatar class selection.  Both  Vishnu  and  Shiva  chose  this  third  option.  Shiva  in  particular enjoyed selecting Shi’s class in this way even as she found the questions “silly” and “strange”: “I really like the way you could choose. I liked the idea of using it to see what you are in the gameworld. I wanted to see what Shi would be in  this  world  according  to  these  questions.”  Shiva  here  admitted  that  she answered the ten questions “completely honestly” in keeping with her real- world identity’s ethics and morals.16 After answering the questions Shiva was assigned  her  avatar’s  class:  Witchhunter   six  magic  answers,  two  combat answers, and two stealth answers . This pleased her: “I liked Witchhunter, I liked it a lot. I was excited!” When asked why this appealed to her so much, she  explained  that  part  of  the  reason  was  the  balance  in  the  class’s  skills between the three gameplay approaches  magic, combat, and stealth . Witch- hunter satisﬁed her earlier desires for an avatar ﬂexible enough to problem solve in different ways. Vishnu’s Steve! was also assigned one of the magic- based classes: Spellsword  ﬁve magic answers, ﬁve combat answers, and no stealth answers . Vishnu was more ambivalent about this classiﬁcation and examined the Major and Minor skills of this class closely but ultimately kept all of them except the Minor Skill Axe, replacing it with Short Sword. The rest of the Spellsword’s skills satisﬁed his initial desire, like Shiva’s, to play a balanced avatar.  Selecting Birthsign  The ﬁnal step in the initial avatar creation process is selecting a Birth- sign. The Morrowind game manual explains the Birthsign’s signiﬁcance: “Per- sons  born  under  certain  constellations  are  said  to  be  ‘fortunate  in  their aspects.’ Such persons are often blessed — or cursed — with remarkable abil- ities  or  weaknesses  as  a  result  of  the  magical  conjunctions  of  celestial inﬂuences”  Hines and Cheng 25 . As is ﬁtting for a videogame set in a fan- tasy world, Morrowind has its own unique constellations  which are in fact visible in the night sky during gameplay . Shiva chose Shi’s Birthsign care- fully. She admitted that she tried hard to match the Birthsign’s abilities with her Witchhunter class, ultimately deciding “The Lady”  with Fortify Person- ality and Fortify Endurance abilities  ﬁt the best:  I was a little sad, I looked, I was trying to match [the Birthsign] with my character’s strengths and my class, and The Lady didn’t quite do it, so I didn’t know if I wanted to choose her. But I looked at the other ones and they didn’t work for me either. And I think Personality was   72  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  one of the options I wanted for my character so it was like, one match and one extra beneﬁt and I was like, “I can do that!” Because she  The Lady  had all positives, no negatives. I liked the idea of if I had two main attributes I would be so pumped up. I loved it!  Vishnu,  however,  expressed  ambivalence  for  most  of  the  Birthsign options, saying they “seemed pretty worthless.” Initially, he wasn’t even sure he remembered which Birthsign he had selected. After looking at the list of possibilities he remembered selecting “The Ritual” which gave the avatar the ability to heal herself and “turn” undead creatures.17 Vishnu explained that his previous experiences playing v–RPGs inﬂuenced his decision to select a Birthsign that would allow Steve! to heal herself:  ZACH: Why did you think [healing yourself ] was going to be impor-  VISHNU: Just knowing that early in the game you generally get your ass  tant?  kicked.  ZACH: Are you saying the avatar is incompetent, early on? VISHNU: I think it’s the player that is incompetent, probably. I know the style of the game or even some of the particulars of that game you just get killed really quickly. [With] the ability to heal I was trying to cover all the bases. I just thought, “Well, if nothing else you can heal yourself.” It’s always a good thing to be able to heal.  ZACH: We know that from role-playing experiences for sure. VISHNU: Having played far too many role-playing games, yes.  As with his other decisions so far, Vishnu relies on the extra-diegetic knowl- edge he has accumulated and internalized from his previous experiences. This accumulation is interesting: it represents a combination of virtual experiences  past v–RPG gameplay  that have been collated and stored in Vishnu’s mind. These experiences inﬂuence Vishnu’s decisions in creating Steve! Vishnu is able to articulate these virtual world decisions in real-world, extra-diegetic ways.  It is evident that both Vishnu and Shiva chose their Birthsigns with the intent of giving their avatars as much of a chance to be successful in the game- world as possible. Without any hands-on experiences yet in Morrowind to aid in determining which Birthsign attributes would be most beneﬁcial to their avatars both participants drew on other sources of information to make deci- sions. Shiva couldn’t imagine wanting any negative attributes associated with her  avatar.  The  inﬂuence  of  her  real-world  identities  is  clear  here.  It  was unimaginable to Shiva to consciously choose characteristics that would impact her avatar negatively  even as the idea of playing a heroic yet ﬂawed Achilles- like avatar might appeal to some users . Shiva was either unwilling or unable to  set  aside  her  goals  for  her  real-world  attributes  when  constructing  Shi.   3. Morrowind  73  Vishnu drew on his memories of past virtual experiences to guide his Birth- sign selection. Perhaps it goes without saying, but clearly virtual experiences are  stored  as  real  memories  by  the  user  and  are  accessed  as  needed.  How should Vishnu’s memories of past videogame experiences be characterized? Are they virtual memories? Real memories? Real memories of virtual expe- riences?  These  are  interesting  questions  that  demonstrate  the  problematic nature of Gee’s terminology. I address this problem in greater detail in chap- ter six.  Morrowind’s avatar creation process is a lengthy one: it took Vishnu just over twenty-two minutes to complete all of these steps and Shiva just over twenty minutes. This is a long time to spend in a videogame essentially set- ting up the game to play. In many videogame genres entire levels and mul- tiple  objectives  can  be  completed  in  twenty  minutes.  It  is  easy  to  imagine many gamers getting frustrated by having to wait so long to actively play the game.  But  in  v–RPGs,  this  experience   which  is  both  diegetic  and  extra- diegetic  actually aids in identity construction. Vishnu explained how this worked for him: “I think it sort of engages you a little bit more, as you become ‘your’ character a little bit more than if you were just watching cut scenes or being pushed forward. I think here you’re actually creating some sort of iden- tity in the game that you’re going to relate to in the game. You created it  the avatar .”  The  many  steps  in  the  avatar  creation  process  in  Morrowind as demonstrated  by  Vishnu  and  Shiva  allow  the  user’s  real-world  identity  to make decisions about her his new virtual identity. This insures that the avatar and user are connected, since all of the decisions the user made for the avatar have real-world justiﬁcations and reasons behind them. In this way the avatar is both virtual and non-virtual. In chapter one Gee described the creation and playing of his avatar Bead Bead as a “delicious blend of my doing and not  my  doing”   54–55   to  help  explain  the  concept  of  projective  identity.  The  initial  creations  of  Vishnu’s  Steve!  and  Shiva’s  Shi  seem  to  share  this blend.  Point of View  As I note in chapter two vision for Haraway is crucial to the construc- tion of self-identities. For Haraway, being able to see a potential subject posi- tion  is  essential  to  being  able  to  inhabit  that  position  and,  thus,  relocate identity. This argument is predicated on some bodily aspect as there must be something tangible to be seen by the viewer. Haraway describes the need for a “semiotic-material technology linking meanings and bodies”  192 . Other scholars agree on the importance of the connections between vision and the body  as  well.  Spinoza  believed  that  language  was  a  bodily  transformation.   74  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  DeLeuze described images as “the traces of an external body on our body”  73 . Walker suggested that in visual depictions “the phenomenal character of the perception is inseparable from the imagining that takes it as an object. The seeing and imagining are inseparably bound together, integrated into a single  complex  phenomenological  whole”   4–5 .  Morrowind too  seems  to consider vision and seeing the body as important to identity construction as the game design allows users to select either ﬁrst-person point of view  POV  or third-person POV. Was being able to have this choice important to Vishnu and  Shiva?  Was  being  able  to  see  their  avatars  crucial  to  the  identiﬁcation process?  Morrowind defaults to ﬁrst-person POV for the duration of the initial avatar creation process: it is not until Socucius Ergalla instructs the avatar to take their release papers from his desk that the user can switch to third-per- son POV if they wish. This process took over twenty minutes for both Vishnu and Shiva and both participants admitted that initially they forgot about the option to switch to third-person POV. The Morrowind avatar cannot be seen in ﬁrst-person POV.18  Representative ﬁrst-person point of view.   3. Morrowind  75  Representative third-person point of view.  As I discussed in chapter two, the connections between identity, the body, and vision are important ones. How then were the participants going to be able  to  see  their  avatars  enough  to  identify  with  them?  This  problem  was solved by Morrowind’s inventory windows. As I explained in chapter three Morrowind’s chronos time runs continually during gameplay but is paused when the user enters the inventory.19 In the inventory screen, the user can examine the map of the gameworld, the avatar’s attributes and skills levels, items the avatar is currently carrying and perhaps most importantly in this case, a full body image of what the avatar looks like. Each of these inventory windows can be enlarged or reduced at the user’s discretion. By changing the clothing and armor the avatar is wearing, the user can continually change the appearance of the avatar which is reﬂected in the inventory screen. In other words, each time the user enters the inventory she is presented with a bod- ily image of her avatar, thus increasing the chances of identiﬁcation  partic- ularly since the user has control over this appearance, from the choices during the initial avatar creation to the clothing and armor choices throughout the gameplay .  Vishnu  described  his  satisfaction  with  this  component  of  the inventory screen:   76  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  VISHNU: I think it gave you a good, as far as visualizing your avatar, you can see the changes you make, um, in apparel and weapons. ZACH: Is that important to you? Is it something that matters to you as  a gamer in this genre?  VISHNU: Yeah! I mean again it’s sort of that customization, making it your own, and obviously you’re limited here in [in the begin- ning to] what they give you, but as you get further into the game you can sort of choose what kind of armor you want. I know I stuck with some armor that probably wasn’t the best because I liked the way it kind of looked. I’m trying to remember, [maybe it] was the Bonemold [armor]. I liked the way it looked, espe- cially  in  the  third  person,  when  you’re  out,  sort  of  looking  at yourself.  In ten hours of Morrowind gameplay Vishnu entered the inventory screen 219 times, sometimes for several minutes at a time. Even if he had played exclu- sively in ﬁrst-person POV Vishnu still had multiple opportunities see his vir- tual body and thus identify more completely with it.  However, Vishnu did not play exclusively in ﬁrst-person POV; in fact, after one hour and nineteen minutes of gameplay he switched to third-per- son  POV  and  never  returned  to  the  ﬁrst-person  perspective.  Vishnu  cited two main reasons why the third-person POV in Morrowind was much more immersive for him. First, he found it much easier to engage in close-quar- ters combat in third-person POV. He explained his frustrations with ﬁrst- person combat:  I felt like I had no depth perception in terms of swinging. So I think I went in and changed it because you have a little bit more of a periph- eral vision. You can see things a little bit more fully in that third per- son view and I kind of like that a little bit more. In combat you can see what’s going on a little bit more around you, especially if you’re surrounded.  The  second  reason  Vishnu  cited  for  his  third-person  preference  was  also related to depth perception and visual bodily identiﬁcation. For Vishnu see- ing the full body of his avatar greatly aided his identiﬁcation with the avatar and his immersion into the gaming world:  VISHNU: You get a better feel of your environment in a 3D sort of way. I think personally depth perception is better in third person. You get  a  feel  and  sense  of  your  size  in  comparison  to  the  world around you that you sometimes don’t get in ﬁrst person. You can see what you yourself are doing, not just your actions, but [what] your character [is] doing.  ZACH: How do you distinguish between those two, not just your actions  but your character’s actions?   3. Morrowind  77  VISHNU: Like not only swinging, or blocking, or walking, but to actu- ally watch the avatar, viewing, swinging the sword, and walking. ZACH: So not just the sword, but seeing the whole body in action, the  world, is important?  VISHNU: To me, yeah, I think so. It gives it a little bit more of a sense of realism in sort of a strange way because in a ﬁrst person mode, there is no sense of the body around you as opposed to in life you can see your arms.  ZACH: You can look at your body at any time. VISHNU: Yeah, you can see it in sort of, you know, even if you’re focus- ing forward you can still sort of see your extremities or some- thing like that that you don’t get in a ﬁrst person. I think it gives you a better sense of again your character in the world, um, that is just cool to look at.  ZACH: Cool to look at because it’s a different body frame, there is inter-  esting armor...  VISHNU: Right, cool armor and stuff like that. ZACH: And all those things contribute to Vishnu’s identiﬁcation with  Steve! the female Dark Elf ?  VISHNU: Yeah, I think so in sort of a weird way. I’ve always felt it’s a little easier to get into the game in third person than it is in ﬁrst person.  First  person  obviously  gives  you  a  through-the-eyes viewpoint,  but  in  a  way  I  think  it  disconnects  you  a  little  bit more because you don’t have that peripheral which is a big part of our vision and our perception.  ZACH: So third person feels more real to you than ﬁrst person does in  the gaming world.  VISHNU: Yeah, in a lot of ways, yeah!  Notice that throughout his explanation here Vishnu refers to the avatar not in the more distant third person “he” or “she” but rather with the more inti- mate “you”: “You get a feel and sense of your size in comparison to the world around you that you sometimes don’t get in ﬁrst person. You can see what you yourself are doing, not just your actions.” This pronoun choice indicates that Vishnu closely identiﬁes with his avatar. Vishnu also stressed how impor- tant it was to him to be able to see Steve! in the gameworld. Vishnu’s per- ception of the avatar was greatly aided by his ability to see the avatar’s virtual body. For Vishnu, identiﬁcation was greatly aided by vision. Seeing the avatar made the virtual identity more real to him: “It gives it more of a sense of real- ism.” This is interesting: it suggests that for Vishnu his perceptions of the importance of the avatar’s virtual body and his “real” physical body are inter- secting. The kinesthetic argument Vishnu makes here indicates the liminal space between Vishnu and Steve! is shrinking in these instances.  Shiva’s Morrowind gameplay took place almost exclusively in ﬁrst-per- son POV. She took pride in describing herself as a ﬂexible gamer capable of   78  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  playing effectively from either perspective: “Whatever you’ve got, just give me and I’ll go with it.” She said she felt like both POVs were “equal” when it came to her ability to become immersed but she did state a fondness for third-person POV similar to Vishnu’s: “Sometimes I try to put myself in ﬁrst person and I don’t like it. I can’t see around the person. I like being there. [But] in Morrowind I did it in ﬁrst person, I guess, so I could be more in char- acter.” Shiva also said that she found the combat in the game easier in ﬁrst- person  POV:  “In  third  person  you  couldn’t  always  see  where  the  monster was.”  Shiva’s  statements  here  show  her  ﬂexibility  when  it  comes  to  POV immersion. Both ﬁrst-person  helping Shiva feel “in character”  and third- person  helping Shiva feel “there”  POV can lead to immersion for her. Point of view wasn’t as crucial to avatar identiﬁcation for Shiva. Her identity as a veteran gamer skilled enough to enjoy both POVs was very important to her; she was proud that she was able to identify with her avatar via either per- spective. Instead, Shiva stressed that her v–RPG immersion and identiﬁcation was dependent on whether or not she liked the avatar she was playing. What might lead to her not liking an avatar she has created? Shiva clariﬁed with the following example, explaining why she preferred the v–RPG Bard’s Tale  which gives the user limited control over the avatar’s creation and develop- ment  to Fable  a v–RPG with more open-ended gameplay and choices for avatar construction :  [With] Fable I was really excited because you can change your charac- ter and I liked some of the options you could do with your character, I guess more freedom, but sometimes I just felt that world was harsher, was meaner, or something. I didn’t connect with my character as much. In Bard’s Tale it wasn’t me as much, but he [the avatar] was funny! And I think of myself as funny, so it was nice to see a funny character, and because I liked the character I felt more [connection to him].  In this instance Shiva identiﬁed more strongly with the gameworld of Bard’s Tale: the mood  for lack of a better word  of Fable’s setting didn’t appeal to Shiva’s real-world sensibilities. In the non-virtual world, Shiva is optimistic, cheerful, quick to laugh, and is eager to please those around her. I mentioned earlier Shiva’s indignance at aspects of Tomb Raider and Grand Theft Auto III:  Shiva  carries  her  real-world  sensibilities  into  her  videogaming  experi- ences. She wants to spend time in a virtual world that resonates with her own pleasant worldview. Fable’s gameworld did not do this, but the light-hearted approach of the Bard’s Tale was a better ﬁt. Fortunately, Shiva was sufﬁciently interested in Morrowind’s gameworld to become invested in her avatar  more on the participants’ Morrowind gameworld immersion later in this chapter . Shiva  also  entered  the  inventory  screens  even  more  than  Vishnu  did:  she accessed those windows 318 times. This gave Shiva ample opportunities to   3. Morrowind  79  Shi’s inventory screen.  view  Shi’s  appearance.  The  avatar’s  appearance  was  certainly  important  to Shiva as she had rejected several racial and facial options for Shi because they were “not pretty enough.” In a fashion similar to Vishnu’s identiﬁcation with Steve!, Shiva’s identiﬁcation was aided by her perception of Shi’s virtual body.  Killing, Stealing, and Dying: Avatar Ethics and Diegetic  Experimentation  After users makes their ﬁnal decisions about the avatar’s race, gender, class,  and  birthsign,  Socucius  Ergalla  instructs  the  avatar  to  pick  up  her release-from-prison papers from his desk and show them to the guard at the door.  This  action  is  necessary  so  that  the  avatar  can  leave  the  Census  and Excise Ofﬁce. From this point forward, the user is now free to explore Mor- rowind in whatever manner they wish. Interestingly enough, at this point, both  Vishnu  and  Shiva  made  gameplay  decisions  that  were  inﬂuenced  by non-diegetic  knowledge.  For  example,  Steve!  immediately  attempted  to Intimidate  Socucius  Ergalla  in  conversation,  resulting  in  Ergalla  having  a   80  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  much lower disposition toward Steve!20 Vishnu also attempted to steal items off of the table in front of Ergalla, causing the NPC to admonish Steve! Why would Vishnu attempt to bully the man who had just set Steve! free? I asked Vishnu to explain his actions:  VISHNU: I think two reasons. Mainly, just to see what the commands actually  did,  you  know,  just  getting  used  to  the  interface,  and knowing how the gameplay actually worked.  ZACH: Did you fear repercussions from your bullying and intimidat-  ing?  VISHNU: That was the second thing. I ﬁgured in this room in this sec- tion you probably aren’t going to get punished for it, you know, trying to steal things, trying to punch people, you know.  ZACH: Why did you think that? VISHNU: Again, familiarity with gaming. Generally you know some- thing that initiates you into the world isn’t going to punish you or have the repercussions that normal gameplay would.  ZACH: And you got the sense you were in kind of safe, “newbie” space? In  other  words,  you  could  try  out  things  that  there  might  be greater repercussions for [later]?  VISHNU: Yeah. In terms of initiating you, that generally, they’ll give you a little bit of leeway and I think I was taking advantage of that as well just to get the gameplay down.  Here, Vishnu uses his knowledge about v–RPG conventions to test the Mor- rowind game system, learning what repercussions certain actions will have. Steve!’s attempts to bully Ergalla is clearly Vishnu making the decision for Steve! based on Vishnu’s past v–RPG experiences. This inﬂuence can also be seen  in  Vishnu’s  decision  to  join  the  Fighters  Guild  in  Balmora.  I  asked Vishnu why he only joined this guild instead of the Guild of Thieves or the Mages Guild. Vishnu again cited his past videogaming experiences as the rea- son why he made this selection:  I think because again familiarity with the  RPG  genre, a Fighters Guild will probably give you better armor, better weapons, so from a practi- cal standpoint I thought the Fighters Guild would probably give you some items that you would need in order to survive a little longer. As opposed  to  joining  a  Mages  Guild,  probably,  you  might  get  some power-ups, some magical items, I don’t know, something, but it may not  be  as  beneﬁcial  up  front  in  the  game  as  better  armor  or  better weapons was probably my thinking on that.  Is the knowledge Vishnu is drawing on diegetic or extra-diegetic? It seems to be a little of both: his real-world identity is remembering past virtual expe- riences that appear relevant to his current Morrowind videogame play. Vir- tual  experiences  stored  as  real  memories  help  Vishnu  make  decisions  for   3. Morrowind  81  Steve! This is signiﬁcant in that it again shows how virtual memories func- tion similarly to real-world memories for Vishnu: both types of memories are stored and are then accessed as needed to aid in predicting appropriate behavior to guide the individual’s actions.  Shiva made choices for Shi in a similar manner. Like Vishnu, Shi imme- diately tried to steal a tankard off of Ergalla’s desk only to be chastised by the NPC. She explained this decision by saying that she “wanted to see what the gameplay was like, if they allowed for stealing or whether there were conse- quences.” Interestingly enough though Shiva ﬁnds a book in the Census and Excise Ofﬁce’s “newbie room”21 and chooses not to take it opting instead to read the book and then replace it on the shelf. When asked why she didn’t take the book and sell it later, Shiva replied that “in a lot of games you can take books but they’re worth like one gold and they take up tons of space so I  guess  maybe  I’ve  been  trained  to  think  that.”  Prior  v–RPG  experiences inﬂuenced this decision. Shiva also had Shi join several different organiza- tions as soon as possible: the Temple, the Mages Guild, the Guild of Thieves, House Hlaalu, the Imperial Cult and the Fighters Guild. This struck me as odd:  why  would  Shi  the  ethical  Witchhunter  want  to  take  orders  from  so many  different  people?  When  asked,  Shiva  was  quick  to  explain  how  this strategy actually dovetailed perfectly with Shi’s projective identity: “I didn’t think  I  was  playing  by  their  rules.  I  just  wanted  their  free  stuff !  I  wanted access. If you join the guilds, you get good advice, and they like you better, and you get more stuff. So I was like, ‘Cool!’ And I just wanted to see what it was like to join. If they gave me orders I didn’t want, I’d just ignore them.” Shiva’s plan was to use the guilds to gain experience and items; she didn’t really consider herself loyal to any of them. Shiva was inﬂuenced by her mem- ories of earlier v–RPG experiences in joining so many different factions but at the same time she was able to justify this decision through the projective identity she was creating for Shi. The explanations given by both Vishnu and Shiva here rely heavily on memories that are paradoxical in terms of identity and  show  a  clear  passage  between  real-world  and  virtual  world  identity. Diegetic  experiences   past  v–RPG  gaming  sessions   become  extra-diegetic memories that are stored within the real-world identities of the user. These memories  are  then  accessed  to  aid  the  user  in  decision-making  in  future diegetic experiences  even if the future diegetic experiences are with a dif- ferent video game . This movement from virtual to real-world and back to virtual demonstrates the convergent and ﬂuid nature of identity construc- tion.  As  a  result  of  their  ability  to  access  earlier  diegetic  experiences,  both Vishnu and Shiva had no hesitations about stealing items in Morrowind. This conduct was a deﬁnite departure from both participants’ real-world identi-   82  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  ties: Vishnu and Shiva were adamant that they would never steal anything outside of virtual space. Shiva admitted that her ethics “are a bit looser” in the virtual worlds of video role-playing games. She believed that many items exist speciﬁcally to be stolen: “It seems in gameplay, all the stuff is just for you. They put barrels and stuff in to give you life experience and money. Peo- ple aren’t going to use it!” Vishnu seconded this notion, justifying Steve!’s continual thievery in Morrowind: “Usually in other RPGs I know some of the best stuff you get you have to steal, or have to get in means other than buy- ing  [or]  purchasing:  sometimes  you  actually  have  to  go  and  take  [it].  You know you’re in a world, a virtual world, you can do things you can’t do in the real world.” Vishnu very clearly distinguishes between Morrowind’s world and  the  “real”  world  to  justify  his  avatar’s  behavior.  Shiva  does  as  well, explaining why she had no qualms about having Shi loot the body of a slaver she had just killed in Addamasartus:22  ZACH: Shiva, how ethical is it to loot the body that you just killed? SHIVA: It’s a slaver! ZACH: Why did you do it? SHIVA: Cause it’s not real world. And I guess I always loot the corpse, in any game I play, even role-playing. I’m the ﬁrst person to loot! They’re dead, they’re not going to need it, and I probably will.  ZACH: No ethical dilemma? SHIVA: No. I guess if I’m willing to kill them, that is not an issue. So  why can’t I steal their stuff ? Who else is going to use it?  Here Shiva demonstrates just how ﬂuidly she can move between diegetic and non-diegetic thinking. She defends her willingness to kill and loot diegeti- cally by pointing out Vvardenfell is not “real world.” Yet she is still compelled to provide rationale for her actions: the NPC is a vile slaver and therefore can be  ethically  killed.  And  if  one  is  willing  to  kill   arguably  the  least  ethical action possible , looting must therefore be acceptable as well. Shiva takes the diegetic actions of Shi seriously enough to justify them rationally.  Vishnu also routinely looted corpses in Morrowind and like Shiva ration- alized and defended the ethics of these decisions, going so far as to suggest that he believed the Morrowind gameworld expected this behavior. Vishnu describes why he looted the body of the Addamasartus slaver he had killed  interestingly enough the same slaver killed and looted by Shiva :  VISHNU: You have to. [Laughing.] ZACH: Ethical behavior? Why was it okay to loot that body? VISHNU: Uh, primarily, he was the aggressor so I probably won’t get punished; um, secondly I think you have to loot people in this game,  well  because  he  probably  has  better  armor  than  you  or something or at least would have money.   3. Morrowind  83  ZACH: So there is no ethical doubt, there’s no hesitation in the killing of the character and in taking anything you want off of the dead body?  VISHNU: I think if he is a villain, or an enemy, I think it’s alright. Again if it’s an unprovoked thing and you just mug someone and kill them,  I  probably  would  still  do  it,  but  it’s  less  ethical.  This  I would have no problems.  ZACH: There’s no hesitation. VISHNU:  No,  because  that’s  fair  game.  He  attacked  me,  that  is  my  reward. It’s the character’s reward.  ZACH: And that’s typical in your RPG experience prior to Morrowind? VISHNU: Yeah. I think so. I think it extends beyond this world.  In their explanations here, both Vishnu and Shiva clearly make a distinction between their real-world ethics and their virtual ethics: stealing and killing become acceptable virtually. Here the distinctions between the two types of identity  are  clear  and  the  participants  have  no  difﬁculty  articulating  these differences. Yet earlier during the creation of the avatar’s name, gender, race, and class both participants demonstrated that this demarcation isn’t always as clear cut. The passage between real-world and virtual-world identities is a  complicated  one.  Immersion  within  Morrowind for  the  participants  res- onates with Gee’s “delicious blend” of virtual and non-virtual memories and identities.  Both participants stressed in their initial interviews that they enjoyed learning  the  individual  systems  of  videogames.  Several  examples  seem  to conﬁrm  this  same  interest  in  learning  Morrowind’s  diegetic  rules  for  both Vishnu and Shiva. Just as Vishnu had experimented by attempting to “Per- suade” Socucius Ergalla through Intimidation, Shiva had attempted to “Per- suade”  Ergalla  through  Admiration.  Shiva  explained  that  she  was  merely testing  her  abilities,  seeing  how  the  Persuasion  component  of  the  game worked. Both Shiva and Vishnu also readily admitted that they had read most of the ﬁfty-page manual that accompanied the videogame before playing Mor- rowind. Vishnu chose to “Persuade” through Intimidation, a choice that res- onated  with  his  real-world  masculine  identity  and  sense  of  humor:  he considered Intimidating Ergalla to be both a “manly” and funny action. Shiva chose Admire, a less aggressive persuasive attempt. This too reﬂects her real- world temperament and easy-going personality. Through their interactions with  Ergalla  here  the  participants  identify  via  merger  with  their  avatar’s actions;  earlier  when  looting  and  killing  they  identiﬁed  via  division.  Both types of identiﬁcation contribute to the overall avatar identity construction within Morrowind. Vishnu even considered the death of his avatar as noth- ing more than a learning experience. After one hour and eighteen minutes of  gameplay,  Steve!  is  killed  in  Addamasartus  by  a  magic-wielding  slaver.   84  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  When asked about how this affected him, Vishnu explained that it upset him only because it meant he would have to replay from his last saved game  which had been eleven minutes earlier representing a substantial amount of game- play .  But  Vishnu  saw  even  this  inconvenience  as  an  opportunity  to  learn how to succeed in Morrowind:  VISHNU: I was more than anything mad because I don’t think I’d saved for awhile. And I had to go back and do all that stuff again! But you know I think because you have that option, you treat it more as a learning experience. You learn that you save more frequently, which is something that you should do in any game but also what sort of tactics work with different characters; with melee char- acters you can just walk up and stab them; with a mage who will attack you from a distance you have to approach it a little dif- ferent.  ZACH: So you hadn’t gone into your Morrowind gameplay experience thinking, I’m going to try to play this whole game through and never die?  VISHNU: No! I don’t think it’s a realistic expectation. ZACH: So you knew death would come for your avatar at some point? VISHNU: You know, it comes for us all. And probably, a lot more for this guy than for me personally. With the save option I knew you could just reload, and you’re back.  Steve! died 26 times in Vishnu’s recorded gameplay; Vishnu clearly accepted this  as  a  normal  part  of  the  gaming  experience.  In  the  above  statement  Vishnu alternately refers to Steve! as “this guy” and “you.” This demonstrates how easily and unconsciously Vishnu moves between considering his ava- tar as an external other  the female avatar he refers to as “this guy”  and as an extension of himself  his usage of the ﬁrst- and second-person “I” and “you” .  Vishnu made it clear that he didn’t consider it a “realistic expectation” for  the  avatar  to  avoid  dying  in  Morrowind.  Certainly,  his  attitude  toward virtual death as an inevitable and common occurrence to be learned from contributed to the frequency with which Steve! was killed. Vishnu’s expec- tation that Steve! would occasionally be killed and his propensity to put Steve! in danger led Vishnu to save his game progress sixty-six times. Up until the point where Steve! died for the ﬁrst time, Vishnu had only saved the game one time  in one hour and eighteen minutes of gameplay . Therefore, over his ﬁnal eight hours and forty-two minutes of gameplay, Vishnu saved his progress  more  than  seven  times  an  hour.  This  shows  evidence  of  his  pen- chant  for  learning  how  to  succeed  within  the  diegetic  space.  Vishnu  also rested23 frequently as well to replenish Steve!’s health, magicka, and fatigue. All  of  these  gameplay  decisions  reﬂect  Vishnu’s  experimental  approach  to   3. Morrowind  85  Morrowind. Steve! served as the guinea pig through which Vishnu tested the gaming system and explored the gameworld.  However, Shiva cared much more deeply about her avatar’s virtual life: Shi never died one time during Shiva’s recorded gameplay. Shiva had a dra- matically different view of avatar death than Vishnu did. It became clear that there  was  considerable  overlap  between  her  virtual  identity  and  her  real- world identity:  ZACH: How important was that to you, to try to play Shi where she is never killed? There are times when it was close, there are battles, but you cast the Intervention spell that teleports you away.  SHIVA: It was really important to me. I guess I just want to survive! I could run; I could just leave. And that’s why I also stayed away from the water. I don’t know if you noticed, but I rarely ever entered the water. It’s like a phobia. I got into a ﬁght with my boyfriend, he told me to go in, and I was like, “No!” I don’t like dying.  ZACH: So dying in Morrowind, you took it pretty seriously. SHIVA: Yes. I get into the games, and, I don’t know. I don’t want to die. ZACH: I was impressed. SHIVA: I think it just depends on how you play. I think I almost get too  into it, which is why I get scared of the water.  ZACH: Shi’s life was important to you in the gameworld. SHIVA: Yes!  Shiva’s real-world unease around water carried over to Shi in Morrowind as did the care with which she handled the avatar’s mortality. Shiva did admit that Shi was killed later during her Morrowind gameplay  outside of the ten hours recorded for this study  but speculated that it didn’t happen more than half a dozen times or so. That’s a very small number given the many threats to the avatar’s mortality within the diegetic space and the dozens of hours of gameplay  Shi  spent  in  Vvardenfell.  As  a  result  of  her  more  careful  explo- ration, Shiva saved her game progress with much less frequency than Vishnu did. She saved the game for the ﬁrst time after ﬁfty-two minutes and thirty- two seconds; overall she saved her progress forty-four times. Shiva also faced many fewer combat situations than did Vishnu. As a result, she rested to heal Shi only seven times.  Shiva and Vishnu demonstrated markedly different approaches to play- ing Morrowind. Yet each participant’s approach was a reﬂection of their real- world  identity.  Vishnu’s  matter-of-fact  handling  of  Steve!’s  death  as  an opportunity  to  learn  more  about Morrowind gameplay  deﬁnitely  shows  a more clear distinction between his real-world identity and his avatar’s vir- tual identity. Yet at the same time learning the rules of the gaming system aided Vishnu’s immersion. Vishnu explained how this worked as he slowly learned the nuances of the complex Morrowind interface:   86  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  VISHNU: [Because] you’re spending hours and hours and hours, you do learn some shortcuts and stuff, clicking and dropping on your character, clicking and dropping in the world, to drop things. Up front, I remember it took me a long time and I could get a little frustrated sometimes.  ZACH: Does that frustration pull you out of this gaming experience or does  it  pull  you  in?  Is  part  of  the  challenge  of  ﬁguring  it  out something that keeps you invested in a way?  VISHNU: Yeah, a little bit. Sometimes the better you get at a game, the less interesting it is, the less you want to play it because you’ve learned the system and learned the rules.  ZACH: Once you ﬁgured out the limitations of the system, ﬁgured out the  inventory,  how  to  manipulate  it,  what  new  challenges  did you set?  VISHNU: I think that became a challenge to accumulate things. I don’t know how far I got into the gaming that you recorded but by the end of the character I had a huge inventory: items and potions and weapons and gold, currency, whatever it was, I had like 68 million dollars, you know, after, it became kind of a “how much can I get” kind of thing. You set new little mini games; you cre- ate your own challenges I think in a lot of ways.  An open-ended v–RPG like Morrowind offers numerous opportunities for users to create mini-games even after they have mastered the game’s sys- temic rules. Vishnu treated death as a type of puzzle to solve: what actions could he have taken that would have kept Steve! from dying? Approaching diegetic encounters as puzzles to be solved aided in Vishnu’s immersion even as his cavalier attitude toward death showed a clear distinction between his real and virtual identities. Shiva however took her avatar’s death much more seriously and demonstrated less distance between Shiva and Shi in this aspect of identiﬁcation.  Avatar Ethics and Diegetic Experimentation Continued:   Fargoth & Hrisskar  Both participants’ initial decisions in Morrowind  generating their avatars and  moving  around  in  the  newbie  space  of  the  Census  and  Excise  Ofﬁce  relied heavily on their real-world identities’ proclivities. Did the virtual iden- tities of Steve! and Shi begin to separate themselves from Vishnu and Shiva as  gameplay  continued?  Immediately  after  leaving  the  Census  and  Excise Ofﬁce, Morrowind users face one ﬁnal mandatory encounter. Fargoth, a Wood Elf, approaches the avatar and tells a sad story: his engraved Ring of Healing has been stolen. Not coincidentally, the avatar has found this ring in a bar- rel in the courtyard of the Census and Excise Ofﬁce  a message from the game   3. Morrowind  87  system having prompted the user to look in the barrel earlier . The avatar is now faced with a choice: either tell Fargoth she found the ring and give it back to him or pretend not to know what he is talking about and keep the ring for herself. This scenario forces the user to make an ethical decision, one of many such decisions that must be made over the course of Morrowind’s gameplay, each helping to construct the avatar’s diegetic history  and thus projective identity . What factors inﬂuenced Vishnu’s and Shiva’s decisions? When  prompted  about  her  decision  regarding  Fargoth’s  ring,  Shiva immediately remembered that Shi had chosen to give the ring back to him. When asked why  she could have either sold the ring for extra gold or kept it to heal herself after combat , Shiva admitted that the decision reﬂected the desire of her people-pleasing real-world identity:  I was playing a really ethical character. I’m such a nerd. I never even thought about selling it. That was never in my mind. I think when I get into the world, it is real, and the characters are real to me. I vote for the underdog, so I was like, “Here, have your ring, it’s your ring!” and I knew it would make him feel happy. I guess it was good for me to create a happy world for the NPCs.  In this instance there is very little difference between Shiva’s morals and Shi’s morals; real-world identity and virtual identity are indistinguishable. Shiva’s interactions  with  Fargoth  seem  to  have  been  internally,  extra-diegetically motivated. Vishnu also remembered Fargoth immediately when prompted and, like Shi, Steve! also opted to return the ring to him. But Vishnu’s ration- ale for doing so was much different than Shiva’s and indicated motivation in keeping with his real-world identity’s passion for ﬁguring out the rules of videogames:  VISHNU: A lot of times knowing the genre you, you’ll get rewarded for making choices that the developers deem as “good” or morally right.  ZACH: “Good” in this case means ethical? It isn’t like your character  stole the ring from Fargoth.  VISHNU: Yeah, ethical. Right, but it was stolen from him. You want to right the wrong, you know. I think in a lot of ways I wanted to see if they rewarded you for doing the “right” thing.  ZACH: Because your experience in RPGs before had been “Do the eth-  ical thing, there is probably going to be a reward.”  VISHNU: Especially in like the Final Fantasy world. Any time you do the right thing you generally get rewarded: they’ll give you an item. Sometimes they’ll even give you it back; you generally are rewarded, and if you do the wrong thing you are usually pun- ished, in the Final Fantasy universe. So I wanted to see what hap- pened I think in this universe.   88  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  Vishnu’s decision reﬂects his ongoing desire to test the limits of the gaming system; this interest in systematic testing is a characteristic of Vishnu’s real- world identity. Vishnu wanted to see if his decision would be rewarded with money or a special item. However, the only reward for returning the ring to Fargoth is a dramatic increase in Fargoth’s Disposition towards the avatar. As Fargoth is not a major NPC in Morrowind  he has no items to sell nor plays a role in any more quests  this doesn’t represent much of a reward. This was Vishnu’s ﬁrst opportunity to learn that Morrowind’s designers haven’t cre- ated a diegetic space that precisely reﬂects real-world ethics. The user is freer to  experiment  with  ethical  decisions  and  test  the  ramiﬁcations  of  actions. Vishnu’s desire to do this can also be seen in the next signiﬁcant ethical deci- sion Steve! is faced with. Upstairs inside Arrille’s Tradehouse  Seyda Neen’s only emporium and hostel , the avatar can encounter Hrisskar Flat-Foot who promptly attempts to strike a deal with the avatar. He asks the avatar to spy on Fargoth and discover the secret stash where Fargoth keeps his valuables. In return for this service he offers to pay the avatar 100 gold  a substantial amount  of  money  for  the  newbie  avatar .  Steve!  refused  to  help  Hrisskar. Vishnu’s attempt to explain why he chose not to aid Hrisskar demonstrates his continued interest in learning the gaming system but it also reveals the inﬂuence of his real-world identity’s ethical code:  VISHNU: I’m not sure. Maybe it was a way to stick it to The Man: he represented the police, the factions, the ones with power I think.  ZACH: This is amongst the group that has been bullying Fargoth? VISHNU: Right, right. I think I was still trying to see again what the rewards were for doing certain ethical actions. I think I was still trying to ﬁnd out speciﬁcally what happened. If there was no reward or pun- ishments, either route, I probably would have done the right thing.  ZACH: The right thing being? VISHNU: Tell the guy, Hrisskar, tell him to go to hell, that I wasn’t going  to do what he was asking me to do.  ZACH: Now why would you do that? Here’s a chance for you to come  VISHNU: Uh, I don’t know. I’m not sure I have an answer. That’s what  ZACH: Is that what Vishnu would do, is that what Steve! would do, or  VISHNU: I think, in this instance, there was no difference. I think it was Vishnu doing that, the gamer doing that, as opposed to the char- acter in the game doing that.  into some loot.  I would do, I think.  was there no difference?  In this case Vishnu’s desire to learn how the gaming system would reward ethical behavior and his real-world code of ethics dovetailed nicely. Vishnu’s desire to have Steve! “stick it to The Man” directly reﬂects his real-world iden-   3. Morrowind  89  tity as a liberal anti-authoritarian. Vishnu admitted to having had his own run-ins with law enforcement ofﬁcials in the past, mostly revolving around actions that were illegal that he considered to be perfectly ethical. Vishnu’s disdain for what he considered to be ridiculous laws and the occasional bul- lying tactics of law enforcement ofﬁcials inﬂuenced his decision to reject Hris- skar’s overtures. Like the encounter with Fargoth, Morrowind’s designers offer no particular reward to users who take this more ethical course of action: Hrisskar accepts the refusal of service calmly and informs the avatar that he’ll just ﬁnd someone else to do the deed. If anything, Morrowind rewards the more unethical action. If the avatar spies on Fargoth and reveals the location of his hiding spot to Hrisskar, Hrisskar rewards the avatar with gold. The two encounters with Fargoth and Hrisskar establish for users that there is no particular pattern for ethical actions in the gameworld: some ethical actions will be rewarded and others will not be, just as some unethical actions will have tangible rewards. This allows users to make diegetic decisions based on how they want to roleplay their avatar without worrying about whether or not these decisions match the ethics of the game designers.  Shiva continued to demonstrate a strong identiﬁcation with Shi in her own encounter with Hrisskar. She also refused to aid Hrisskar in his scheme to rob Fargoth, saying that Hrisskar came across as a “jerk” who she despised: “I didn’t like him. I didn’t like him at all, and I was like, ‘I’m not going to help you. I am not going to help you.’” As previously mentioned Shiva’s real- world identities are friendly, relaxed, and gentle. Hrisskar’s arrogance and strong-arming tactics offended Shiva; Hrisskar displayed characteristics that Shiva  associated  with  real-world  men  she  considered  to  be  “jerks.”  Just  as Shiva attempted to avoid men with this personality, she wanted Shi to avoid them in Vvardefell as well. Witchhunter Shi’s ethics and Shiva’s ethics are the same in this instance.  It is clear that ethics were important for both participants: Vishnu and Shiva adamantly defended their avatars’ rights to steal and loot dead bodies, claiming these actions were ethically acceptable in Morrowind’s virtual world. Vishnu  even  defended  one  NPC  in  Seyda  Neen’s  lighthouse  who  attacked Steve! for attempting to steal one of her books. Steve! was still a newbie char- acter at this time  he had not yet even leveled up once  and took a severe beat- ing  from  the  woman  before  ﬂeeing  the  lighthouse.  After  a  few  hours  of gameplay, a much stronger Steve! returned to Seyda Neen but never reentered the lighthouse to seek revenge for the savage beating he had taken. Vishnu explained the ethics behind his decision:  VISHNU: I think I was trying at that point not to kill anyone, to murder anyone. I mean you can kill people, you know, but you don’t want to murder anyone. I think the game makes that distinction as well.24   90  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  ZACH: They do talk about it, they make it clear if you’re attacked, that’s  VISHNU: Right. Exactly. ZACH: If you initiate, kind of unprovoked. But didn’t that woman attack  not a murder.  you?  VISHNU: Yeah. But I stole from her. ZACH: You thought she was justiﬁed in her attack? VISHNU: Yeah, exactly.  Vishnu’s statement here reveals just how immersed he is in Morrowind’s game- world; he has begun to internalize the habitus of Morrowind, justifying the actions of the NPCs within this virtual space. McMahan  drawing on Turkle  reminds us that interaction with NPCs can often aid a user’s immersion into and identiﬁcation with a video game: “The use of a synthetic social actor can lead to a heightened sense of presence [since] users respond to the computer itself as an intelligent social agent”  78–79 . Vishnu’s interactions with the woman in the Seyda Neen lighthouse and Shiva’s interactions with Fargoth and Hrisskar demonstrate this phenomenon. Both participants have rational and  ethical  explanations  justifying  their  interactions  with  the  NPCs  men- tioned here. These explanations seem to be a combination of the participants non-diegetic  personalities  and  experiences   experiences  tied  to  their  real- world identities , the users’ awareness of Morrowind’s systemic rules, immer- sion in Morrowind’s gameworld, and identiﬁcation with their avatars  tied to their virtual and projective identities .  Real-World Interests, Virtual Tendencies: Morrowind Books  Vishnu’s and Shiva’s avatars’ decisions were clearly inﬂuenced by their real-world identities in other ways as well. Shi spent time reading each of the books  she  discovered  in  Morrowind.  Slowly  turning  the  pages  of  a  virtual book doesn’t appeal to every videogame player; when asked why she took the time to do this reading, Shiva replied that she simply loved books, saying they “fascinated” her.25 In her initial interview she had revealed that before she discovered videogames she spent most of her spare time reading books, par- ticularly science ﬁction and fantasy novels. Interest in these genres obviously carried over to videogames. Shiva also revealed that she is still a voracious reader and her love of books dictated Shi’s interest in the many dozen books in Morrowind. Vishnu’s reaction to Morrowind’s books was a little different: whereas Shi read each book she came across and usually left them where she found  them,  Steve!  took  each  book  he  found   which  often  meant  stealing them  yet never spent any time reading them during these ten hours of game- play. I asked Vishnu why he did this:   3. Morrowind  91  ZACH: Some of the books you kept but never read could have been sold for more money than some of the other loot that you found that you did sell.  VISHNU: Yeah, I don’t know. ZACH: You didn’t read any of them. But you kept them all. VISHNU: I don’t know, it’s true, it’s a lot like my house; I have stacks  and stacks of books that I have not read but I keep them.  ZACH: Why keep them around? VISHNU: Because I may eventually go read them, I think.  An English Literature major, Vishnu loved books and collected them in his non-virtual house. This component of his real-world identity dictated Steve’s compulsion to hoard books as he found them: Vishnu could not bear to have his virtual identity sell any of the books. Several of the books in Morrowind are valuable and sell for hundreds of gold pieces. As Steve! never read any of the books, there is clearly no value in having the avatar hold onto them: the desires of Vishnu’s real-world identity actually hurt his virtual-world iden- tity here, as the books merely take up the limited carrying space in Steve!’s inventory without providing any beneﬁt in money or knowledge.26  Choosing One’s Own Path: Gameworld Exploration and   Narrative  In their initial interviews, both Vishnu and Shiva stressed the impor- tance of a compelling narrative story for memorable videogame play. Both participants recalled times when they had stopped playing videogames because they were unable to immerse themselves in the game’s narrative. Both Vishnu and Shiva remarked that they enjoyed their experiences playing Morrowind very much; each went on to log many more hours beyond the ten required for this project. Yet interestingly enough, neither participant expressed much interest in the game’s main quest narrative: having the avatar fulﬁll the Nere- varine Prophecies and defeat Dagoth Ur under Red Mountain. The avatar receives speciﬁc orders in the Census and Excise Ofﬁce that will propel this main narrative forward: take a package to Caius Cosades in Balmora. It is true that both Vishnu and Shiva visited Balmora within their ﬁrst ten hours of gameplay, and delivered the package to Cosades. These actions seemed to indicate that they were interested in pursuing this narrative path. But when asked about the importance of this narrative, both participants revealed they had more pressing interests within Morrowind. Shiva eschewed the main nar- rative because she felt doing so was in keeping with the virtual identity she was establishing for Shi: “My Witchhunter was an ethical rebel [and] I didn’t want to do what they said.” In this case the “they” were the administrators   92  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  in the Census and Excise Ofﬁce, working in conjunction with Caius Cosades. Shiva pictured Shi as rebellious and blindly following orders didn’t ﬁt with that projective identity. Shiva stressed that instead she wanted to “see what the world was like, get a grasp of the world a little bit.”27  Exploration of Morrowind’s gameworld was also Vishnu’s main interest. When  asked  if  he  was  interested  in  progressing  in  the  main  narrative  he replied, “No, I wanted to explore the world. I wanted to see what was around, and stuff, knowing that it was pretty open ended. I was much more inter- ested in seeing what the world looked like and ﬁnding out what types of inter- actions you could have with characters, with items.” If he was not interested in progressing the main narrative, why had Vishnu chosen to head to Balmora  where Caius Cosades is located  rather than any of Morrowind’s other loca- tions? I pressed Vishnu on this point and he revealed that his decision reﬂected his desire to both improve Steve! and explore Vvardenfell:  VISHNU: I think you know obviously you want to move [the narrative] along a little bit. I wanted to, I guess I should go back and say it was mildly important to progress [the story] because obviously you need to get some tasks in in order to build up the character, to level up, to do sorts of stuff like that.  ZACH:  So  only  toward  the  ends  of  making  your  character  level  up,  improve, get stronger, did you care about missions at all?  VISHNU: And just progressing the game a little bit because you do want to perform some sort of narrative, you know, and I knew that was where they were trying to push you; the programmers and the  developers  want  you  to  go.  In  order  to  open  up  the  game more and progress the story, you have to go that way. I think I headed that way but got lost along the way. ZACH: And were okay getting lost along the way. VISHNU: Yeah, and I knew that was the ultimate destination, and so I think it was a bit of going towards moving the story along and also seeing what was around.  ZACH:  But  it  doesn’t  sound  like  story  was  your  driving  thing,  even though from our earlier interview, a good story was the thing you kept coming back to over and over as what made for memorable gaming.  VISHNU: Right. Uh, I think I was really impressed by the design of the world and everything. I think I wanted to see a lot more of it before I got into some story development.  It was interesting to discover that Morrowind’s vast game world  illus- tration six  contributed signiﬁcantly to both participants’ level of immersion in the game space. When asked if she found exploring Vvardenfell with Shi immersive Shiva replied, “Oh yeah, deﬁnitely. I liked [how] it changed, you had swampy land, you had different types of monsters, and then it got greener   3. Morrowind  93  just   with  lakes.”  Vishnu stressed  also  that  the  look  of  Mor- rowind’s world really impressed  him: “Visually  it  was pretty  stimulating.... I  remember thinking that visually it  was  very  striking, with  purples,  reds, just really good, um, and really different. I mean,  I  think  they did a pretty good job making it a dynamic world; there was a lot of variety in terrain, characters and  around,  and  just items,  and  things  to look at.”  Vvardenfell, Morrowind’s island setting.  When asked what stood out the most about his experience playing Mor- rowind, Vishnu adamantly said the gameworld rather than his avatar. Vishnu stated that he was also impressed by the game’s sound and the world’s vast size: “It’s a huge map! [That] really struck me, as I started to wander, and I think I didn’t realize how big [the world] was, heading towards Balmora the ﬁrst time. I read online it’s somewhere like 23 square miles, or something like that.” Vishnu also stressed that having Steve! navigate this space on foot really helped to impress this sense of Morrowind’s size upon him and helped him become immersed within the diegetic space.  Avatar Identiﬁcation  Shiva seemed consistently to identify strongly with Shi throughout her Morrowind gameplay. In keeping with this, when asked what she remembered the most about her time spent playing the game, Shiva replied, “My charac- ter. I really liked my character.” She went on to explain in greater detail:  SHIVA: You get so much control over that character. I got to do what- ever I wanted. I felt very connected with that character I guess and it was just, I don’t know, that’s what’s with you the whole   94  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  time, the character. You kill things, you wander, you’re stuck in the wilderness, and you have to talk to people, but you’re always with your character so that is what stuck out to me.  ZACH: Who was [Shi], in your mind? SHIVA: I guess mostly an extension of me.  Shiva’s point is well taken: in a v–RPG, the avatar is continually present  even in ﬁrst-person POV , and each decision made by the user contributes to the burgeoning  history  and  projective  identity  of  the  user-as-avatar.  Shiva demonstrated consistently throughout her gameplay a willingness to “ego- invest,” to use Schafer’s concept, in her avatar in a substantial way Vishnu never seemed interested in. Whereas Steve! took all the items from the Cen- sus and Excise Ofﬁce’s newbie room, Shi only took the dagger and some food, refusing  to  take  the  many  miscellaneous  tableware  items.  Her  explanation demonstrated this ego investment, this fusion, between her real-world and virtual world identity: “I just don’t think my Witchhunter would be the type. I was thinking about playing as my Witchhunter, and Witchhunter was the type of character that would take what we needed, but not go overbounds with it.” Shiva’s usage of the word “we” in this statement is interesting. She clearly sees a strong connection between herself and her avatar and this con- nection  was  consistent  throughout  her  ten  hours  of  Morrowind gameplay  illustration seven .  Vishnu took a more light-hearted approach to role-playing Steve! and never achieved the depth of identiﬁcation with his avatar that Shiva did with Shi. Vishnu made diegetic decisions strategically and experimentally, seem- ingly more interested in learning the Morrowind gaming system than ego- investing in Steve! But of course his carefree approach to Steve! did not mean that Vishnu was unable to identify with his avatar; he did so by drawing on his past real-world experiences to create Steve! and make diegetic decisions. Vishnu did become gradually more invested in his virtual identity Steve! Early on in his experience, he mostly made decisions  like attempting to Intimi- date Ergalla and giving Fargoth his ring back  that reﬂected Vishnu’s desire to test Morrowind’s systemic rules and ﬁnd out if ethical behavior was going to be rewarded as it is in so many v–RPGs. Once Vishnu decided that the game wasn’t going to particularly reward ethical behavior, his gameplay tac- tics shifted. Having somewhat satisﬁed his real-world identity’s desire to learn the gaming system, he began to make decisions based on what was in his vir- tual identity’s best interest. He explained why he made this change:  VISHNU:  I  think  it  changed  because  I  realized  that  the  consequences weren’t very signiﬁcant and I started to get to the point where I wanted  to  start  collecting  items,  things  that  would  give  you bonuses,  statistical  bonuses  or  anything  like  that.  I  think  my   3. Morrowind  95  Shi after ten hours of Morrowind gameplay.  process there was, they are not really going to punish [unethical behavior] so I might as well fuck up.  ZACH:  It  sounds  like  initially  that’s  Vishnu  making  decisions  about what he would do, but the farther you get, it stops being about what Vishnu wants, and starts being about what’s in Steve!’s best interests.  VISHNU: Yeah, I think so, I think so. That’s pretty accurate.  Vishnu  was  still  able  to  identify  with  the  avatar  despite  being  much  more interested and invested in Morrowind’s world.  What was the connection between the participants’ real-world identities and  their  virtual  identities?  Analysis  of  Vishnu’s  and  Shiva’s  cumulative  Morrowind data shows  both  participants  relied heavily on their real-world personalities  and  experiences  to  construct  their  avatars.  With  very  little  Morrowind-speciﬁc diegetic knowledge to go on when creating their avatars, both  Vishnu  and  Shiva  turned  to  their  past  videogaming  experiences  and memories and their real-world identities and personalities to make decisions about name, race, gender, class, and birthsign. Real-world inﬂuences  from Vishnu’s  passion  for  humor,  statistical  analysis,  and  systemic  rules  explo-   96  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  Steve! after ten hours of Morrowind gameplay.  ration to Shiva’s fear of water and of dying  also dictated many of the diegetic choices each participant made during these ﬁrst ten hours of gameplay. Both the virtual and the real contributed to the participants’ identity experiences, “deliciously blended” together. Vishnu described the need for this essential blend  of  real  and  virtual  identity  when  discussing  Morrowind’s  visually impressive  world,  speculating  that  it’s  immersive  potential  was  reliant  on both:  [Morrowind had] a lot of sort of like dualistic properties, that it is pat- terned in a sense, that it is large like the scope of the real world; it’s unique in that it has different textures, terrains in different areas, dif- ferent plants that grow; the towns are different. So I think the variety there sets it up in a way that is patterned on our real world if you want to call it that, but also that there is enough distinction in the game and in  the  gameworld  that  you  know  that  it’s  a  fantasy  world  as  well. Because it’s a fantasy world, it’s good to have a world that isn’t quite like ours, that is kind of alien. So in a game that is a fantasy game, to have a world with no referents to our world, I think it would lose a lit- tle bit of the immersive quality. I think it’s realistic enough that you know it’s almost like your world only better. Only cooler, you know?   3. Morrowind  97  Vishnu’s words here seem applicable to how both participants felt about their avatars as well. Vishnu’s and Shiva’s Morrowind experiences reveal that the initial creation of a virtual identity is a complicated process that draws heav- ily on the user’s real-world identities and experiences. The in-game, ongo- ing  creation  of  the  avatar’s  projective  identity  is  also  overdetermined, inﬂuenced by identity components both diegetic  virtual  and extra-diegetic  real-world .  Exactly  where  real-world  identity  ended  and  virtual  identity began was uncertain at best for both participants. The projective liminal space between Vishnu and Steve! and between Shiva and Shi was at times indis- cernible as real and virtual identities meshed together.  Of course, both Shiva and Vishnu had long videogaming histories, and had many years of v–RPG experience prior to their participation in this study. That may have enabled them to identify with their avatars much more eas- ily than, say, a person with less interest in videogames in general and less expo- sure to v–RPGs in particular. How might a casual videogamer identify with their v–RPG avatar? For the next phase of my study, I selected just such a person  and  a  new  videogame.  This  participant’s  name  is  Tom,  and  the videogame is Morrowind’s sequel, Oblivion. I turn now in chapter four to dis- cussion and analysis of Tom’s videogaming proclivities and his avatarial expe- riences within Oblivion.   4  Oblivion  Identity and the Casual Gamer  After spending many hours talking with both Shiva and Vishnu for the Morrowind portion of this project, I realized that the better I came to know both  participants,  the  greater  my  understanding  was  of  the  connections between their real-world and virtual identities. This was because the partic- ipants’ personal histories, personalities, and interests signiﬁcantly impacted the diegetic choices they made for their avatars. As a result, when selecting the “casual gamer” for the next portion of this study, I opted to choose a close friend: Tom. Tom was a colleague of mine in the English Department at Ari- zona State University; he was also working on a PhD in Rhetoric and Com- position. As a result, we had taken classes together, served on committees together, and socialized with each other as well. During the time this study was  conducted  Tom,  a  Caucasian  male,  was  33  years  old.  Tom  had  some videogaming experience, but as his gaming history and preferences reveal, he gamed with much less regularity  and for different reasons  than Shiva and Vishnu.  Tom’s Videogaming History  Tom’s earliest experiences with videogames were when he was ﬁve years old. Even as he couldn’t remember exactly which videogaming console sys- tem his family had, he distinctly remembered a “Pong sort of system” as a young child. This paved the way for additional videogaming systems as he grew older: “We got the Atari 2600 when I was eight; we got a Colecovision when I was about ten or eleven. We got a Nintendo Entertainment System when I was thirteen, and we also had computers. We had an Atari home com- puter, and we had a 16 mega-hertz PC and I played games on that too.” Most of these early gaming experiences for Tom were social opportunities: he and his brother would play, and occasionally his mom would even join in. Most of  the  games  Tom  remembered  enjoying  during  these  years  were  arcade  98   4. Oblivion  99  games, like Pac Man, Space Invaders, Burger Time, Popeye, Donkey Kong, and Joust  arguably Tom’s favorite arcade game ever . Tom and his brother would visit video arcades whenever possible as well, and would play whatever arcade games were in the local grocery store  where Tom’s love of Joust was born . Unlike most modern console and PC videogames, arcade games are designed so that the user will fail  usually this means dying  rather quickly. This way, more and more quarters are required to keep playing; that’s how arcade games make money. Thus, arcade games have relatively short and challenging lev- els. The early levels of Donkey Kong are a perfect example of this: rolling bar- rels  and  jumping  ﬁreballs  both  contribute  to  regular  death  for  Mario, especially for novice gamers. For most arcade gamers, ﬁnishing the game isn’t a possibility; the challenge of staying alive as long as possible and accumu- lating higher and higher scores provides the impetus to keep playing. Tom’s love of arcade games fell into this category. He and his brother  and occa- sionally even his aunt  would try to one-up each other’s high scores in games like Ms. Pac-Man and Pitfall. For Tom, these competitive, social and famil- ial aspects were videogames’ greatest appeal through his high school years. After high school ended, however, Tom’s videogame play dropped dras- tically. When I asked him why, he told me that his family stopped buying the newer console systems and computers as they came out. While this made it more difﬁcult to get excited about the new games that were coming out, an even greater factor was the loss of Tom’s social gaming network: going to col- lege meant less time spent with his brother, aunt, and junior high and high school friends. For Tom, these family members and friends were the main reasons why he enjoyed videogames in the ﬁrst place as they provided social opportunities. Tom was and is extremely introverted and quiet; prior to going to college videogames provided an opportunity to be social in ways Tom was comfortable with. To be sure, Tom found his early videogaming experiences fun, but mostly because they aided in socialization. When the social aspects of  videogaming  Tom  was  used  to  dried  up  in  college,  he  stopped  playing videogames regularly: “I do like to play social games. If I don’t have too many friends who play those kinds of games or I can’t do it socially, it’s harder for me to get into [videogaming].” When Tom did play videogames during his college years, it was mostly on the PC his parents had bought while he was in high school. Tom stressed that the videogames he played during college were all “very heavy on action.” The Mechwarrior series was one of Tom’s per- sonal favorites during these years, but Tom admitted he played videogames sporadically at best during his college years. Since Tom began his graduate school work, he admitted that his videogaming experiences were a little more frequent,  as  having  friends  who  enjoyed  playing  allowed  Tom  to  use videogaming to his social beneﬁt. He stressed how fun he found playing Wii   100  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  Sports to be with a group of friends periodically, saying that several social gam- ing sessions had recently lasted two hours or more. Unlike Shiva and Vishnu, who both admitted that they could game alone for hours on end, Tom was adamant that only his social videogaming experiences were ever for very long periods of time  more than an hour . When gaming alone, he usually played for only twenty minutes or so  usually a level or two : “There is no way I’d sit for hours in front of [the computer]. I’d really have to like the game and I haven’t found anything that will captivate my attention.”  Tom deﬁnitely had different gaming preferences than Shiva and Vishnu. Whereas those diehard gamers both stressed how much they loved videogames with interesting narratives and how much they enjoyed ﬁguring out the gam- ing  system  and  exploring  vast  gameworlds,  Tom  expressed  none  of  these interests. Instead, through our interviews, Tom made it clear that he enjoyed dominating  videogames  rather  than  learning  how  to  dominate  them.  In announcing Joust as his favorite arcade game, Tom said, “I do love to break out Joust. And I’m good at it.” Much of his fondness for that particular arcade game stemmed from his perceived mastery of it. This gaming preference was reiterated when Tom discussed why he loved the Mechwarrior series:  ZACH: How did you get turned on to Mechwarrior? TOM: Mechwarrior came to me in high school through people that I knew. So when I got Mechwarrior, it was fairly new and fairly advanced videogame technology at the time. It was fun to blow things up. It was fun to win! There is a story that goes with it but I didn’t care too much about that. It was all about the lev- els. It’s got different difﬁculty levels on it. You can start with the easy one and just blow stuff up and be completely invincible and nothing will really hurt you very much.  ZACH: Is that where you would start? TOM: Yeah, then work my way up. Exactly. There were some levels I really  like,  and  I  can  set  those  on  the  hardest  setting,  and  it’s challenging, but it’s also relaxing for me. Because I know a pat- tern that works really well with the level, and it is fun to come out victorious. And I know that I will. I would play some of those levels over and over again, because I wanted to win it.  ZACH: So part of the challenge is in ﬁguring out the pattern on that  level? Figuring out the strategy?  TOM: No, the appeal is knowing the strategy. Once I know it, I could play that level over and over again, in a short burst, just to relax.  For Tom, the joy of playing Joust and Mechwarrior wasn’t in the process of ﬁguring out how to master the game, as is common for many videogamers  like Shiva and Vishnu . Instead, Tom enjoyed the mastery of the game itself, or  in  a  game  like Mechwarrior,  in  particular  levels  of  the  game.  Once  he   4. Oblivion  101  ﬁgured out the strategies necessary to dominate a level, he would play that level over and over again. This domination made Tom feel powerful and gave him the conﬁdence he was good at something.  These videogaming traits were also revealed in Tom’s explanation of the only v–RPG he had every played prior to this study. It was called Alternate Reality. Released in 1985, Alternate Reality was a ﬁrst-person perspective fan- tasy science ﬁction RPG centered on the human avatar surviving and explor- ing an alternate reality  having been abducted and sent there by aliens . Tom identiﬁed this game as an “anomaly” among his early videogaming experi- ences: it didn’t ﬁt the arcade action type of games he otherwise played exclu- sively. I asked Tom why he also didn’t enjoy the much more popular Ultima IV, released the same year:  TOM: I think with Ultima IV, I don’t know, I mean I had Ultima IV and I had Alternate Reality, and in Alternate Reality the view was ﬁrst person,  which  seemed  more  realistic  to  me. Ultima  IV,  at  the time the technology was different, but you had this little almost stick ﬁgure on the ground going around. So in a sense, Alternate Reality was more realistic because it was ﬁrst person.  ZACH: That’s an interesting point: you consider ﬁrst-person more real-  istic than third?  TOM: Yeah. I think I enjoy it more. ZACH: Interesting. So ﬁrst person is your preferred gaming viewpoint?  You don’t crave seeing your avatar? It’s not crucial?  TOM: No. It’s not crucial. Another thing, I liked the graphics on Alter- nate  Reality better.  They  were  done  pretty  well  for  the  time  I think. There was music, and something that was kind of a big deal for me, I knew other people who had played it, and one kid had  actually  gone  and  mapped  out  the  entire  game  on  graph paper. I wasn’t motivated enough to do that, but if I had the map, it was fun to go ﬁnd the stuff and play, develop the character. And  another  reason  that  I  liked  Alternate  Reality better  than Ultima: with Alternate Reality, we had little cheat programs that we  could  use  to  resurrect  our  characters  if  we  wanted  to.  We could give them money that they needed to buy the equipment they were supposed to have.  ZACH: So you could in a sense hack the game to cheat, give extra life,  extra money?  TOM: Yeah, and so that just made it easier for me to go through and  ﬁnd everything I needed on the map.  ZACH:  No  guilt?  No  guilt  about  cheating  with  extra  money?  There  are purists who would say that’s cheating, they would never do that.  TOM: I’m not a purist. [Laughs.] I was happy to get the map for Alter- nate Reality. I probably would not have played it if I didn’t have   102  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  one because it was very complex. And also, if I was dying off too much, I probably wouldn’t have wanted to play it either.  ZACH: So having the cheats in Alternate Reality kept you playing the game. TOM: Yeah. I didn’t want to invest the time into the character. I just wanted to enjoy the game, do the stuff I wanted to do, win, not get killed. I wanted to go wherever I wanted and do whatever I wanted.  Tom made it clear here that he didn’t have any interest in building up the strength of his avatar or in exploring the gameworld; he simply wanted to dominate the game in the same way he enjoyed dominating levels of arcade and action games. Of course, v–RPGs like Morrowind and Oblivion require gamers to do exactly the things Tom expressed little interest in: slowly raise the avatar’s attributes through exploration of a vast gameworld. Oblivion has no real levels, and even completing the main narrative of the game takes many dozen hours; dominating the game in the way Tom prefers is not possible without a cheat code. Tom’s gaming preferences convinced me he was a casual videogame player who was not inclined to identify strongly with his avatar or the overall Oblivion gaming experience.  Indeed, Tom revealed that with rare exception, he had never really felt any  connections  between  virtual  videogame  identities  and  his  real-world identity. When I pushed Tom speciﬁcally on this point, he stressed that dur- ing his younger years when he was gaming regularly, the only way he identiﬁed with the videogames he enjoyed was through purchasing merchandise. He admitted that he had a few Pac-Man t-shirts that he wanted to wear all the time, so much so that his mom had to sneak them away to wash them. But other than this consumerism, Tom’s early videogaming experiences made lit- tle impact on him. This was also true of Tom’s more recent return to spo- radic videogaming as well, but with one notable exception: Grand Theft Auto III. This was the one game that Tom admitted he had noticed having a tem- porary  real-world  effect.  Interestingly  enough,  it  was  the  same  effect  that Vishnu had experienced: having difﬁculty following trafﬁc laws when driv- ing immediately after a GTA III gaming session. Tom stressed that this was the only aspect of that game that had affected him, saying that none of the “other  types  of  violence”  in  the  game  stayed  with  him  “unless  they  were related to the car.” I asked Tom to speculate on why the car-related mayhem impacted him more:  TOM: Just off the top of my head, I would say that the car is something that I use on a daily basis, I own one. It is an integral part of my life, in a way that gun violence is not.  ZACH: So that stuff is more removed from your daily experience, so it  doesn’t have the same impact, the same carry over?  TOM: Yeah. I don’t own a gun.   4. Oblivion  103  Tom is not an imaginative person. His lack of interest in the stories of Mech- warrior and Alternative Reality attest to this. His identiﬁcation with the one aspect of GTA III that he could tangibly relate to also demonstrates his lit- eralmindedness.  For  Tom,  the  potentials  of  videogames  to  explore  fantasy worlds and play with virtual identities for the sake of these explorations holds little interest. If a videogame can’t be dominated and won fairly easily, Tom historically has had little interest or motivation in that game.  Videogame Selection: Oblivion  All of Tom’s videogaming proclivities were challenged by Oblivion. Like its predecessor Morrowind, Oblivion offers gamers an enormously open-ended fantasy roleplaying experience. Released in 2006, four years after Morrowind, Oblivion’s design and gameplay mimics Morrowind’s quite closely with a few relatively minor but important changes. In keeping with the history and lore of the Elderscrolls universe, the same ten racial options are available for the avatar as in Morrowind: Argonian, Breton, Dark Elf, High Elf, Imperial, Kha- jiit, Nord, Ord, Redguard, and Wood Elf. The gamer may choose to play as a male or female in any race as well and is free to select the name of the avatar. However,  whereas  Morrowind allowed  only  a  small  sampling  of  precon- structed facial options for each race, Oblivion takes full advantage of techno- logical improvements to offer an incredibly deep facial construction system. All parts of the face can be manipulated individually, from the shape of the brow ridge to the ears, eyes, nose, cheekbones, and chin. The coloring of hair, eyes and skin can be manipulated as well. As a result, each gamer’s Oblivion avatar has the potential to be truly unique in appearance, given the thousands of choice combinations possible. I was curious to see if these options would have any impact on Tom’s identiﬁcation with his avatar.  Oblivion also  offers  the  same  eight  avatar  Attributes  as  Morrowind: Strength, Intelligence, Willpower, Agility, Speed, Endurance, Personality, and Luck. These Attributes range from 0–100, initially dependent on the race and sex of the avatar. Over the course of the gaming experience, the gamer can choose  which  of  these  Attributes  to  improve  when  leveling  up;  it  is  these decisions that help make each invested gamer’s roleplaying experience unique, immersive, and personalized. Leveling up occurs just as it did in Morrowind: the avatar must improve ten points of their preselected Major Skills and then rest and meditate. However, whereas Morrowind offered 27 Skills from which to choose the Major Skills, Oblivion offers only 21.1 Oblivion’s creators also made certain actions more simulatory than they had been in Morrowind. For example, attempts to pick the locks of doors and chests in Morrowind were handled by the game’s preprogrammed AI; the avatar attempted to pick the   104  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  lock by pushing a button, and the game calculated the percentage chance of success based on the avatar’s rating in the Lockpick skill and the lock level of the door in question. The AI then conducted an automatic “dice-roll” to determine  whether  or  not  the  attempt  was  successful.  The  gamer  simply awaited the instantaneous pronouncement of success or failure. Oblivion gives the gamer an active role in the success or failure of their lockpicking attempts by  simulating  the  manipulation  of  a  lock’s  tumblers  with  a  lockpick.  The Oblivion gaming manual describes this process speciﬁcally:  Locks are crafted in ﬁve grades of quality. The better a lock’s quality, the more tumblers it has, and the harder it is to pick. To pick a lock, use  the  lockpick  to  test  each  tumbler  and  loft  it  into  its  set  point. Springs of varying tensions are used to restrain tumblers from their set points. Press [the appropriate button] to attempt to lock each tum- bler into place when it is at its set point. The slightest error may cause other  tumblers  already  lodged  at  their  set  points  to  drop,  requiring them to be picked all over again. The higher your Security skill, the easier it is to lodge a tumbler in its set point [41].  If the gamer prefers not to spend time manually attempting to pick a lock, Oblivion does offer the same “Auto Attempt” option as Morrowind. Oblivion also  allows  for  more  strategic  hand-to-hand  melee  combat  by  making  the Block skill active. In Morrowind, Block was a passive skill like Lockpicking: the  game’s  AI  calculated  whether  or  not  the  avatar  successfully  blocked  a  Oblivion’s simulatory Lockpicking feature.   4. Oblivion  105  melee attack based on the Block skill level. Oblivion gives the gamer more control over when or if to attempt to Block a melee attack:  To block, push and hold the [appropriate button]. A shield or weapon block reduces the damage you take. Shields are much more effective at Blocking  than  weapons.  An  effective  combat  strategy  is  to  block  an enemy’s blow, then quickly follow up with your own attack to catch the enemy before he can ready his block. Establishing this block-and- counter  rhythm  in  melee  combat  can  greatly  improve  your  combat effectiveness [28].  The inclusion of the strategic Lockpicking and Blocking active skills allows interested  gamers  additional  opportunities  to  identify  with  their  avatar  in simulatory ways and become further immersed in the gameworld.  Oblivion also continues in the fantasy role-playing tradition with a typ- ically epic storyline that places the gamer’s avatar as the pivotal player in a struggle of good vs. evil. In similar fashion to Morrowind, the gamer’s avatar begins the game in prison: this time in the Imperial City in Cyrodiil. Pre- dictably, the avatar doesn’t remain imprisoned for long:  Oblivion begins with the arrival of Emperor Uriel Septim VII accom- panied by a troupe of Blades bodyguards, at the Imperial City prison, seeking to ﬂee from a group of assassins— later revealed to be mem- bers of the Mythic Dawn — through a secret underground exit in the city sewers. By chance, the exit is located in the cell occupied by the [avatar]. The Emperor frees the player as he believes that he saw the character in his dreams, and sets off into the catacombs as the avatar follows.  At  the  end  of  the  catacombs,  the  group  is  ambushed,  and quickly overwhelmed by assassins, which results in the protagonist tak- ing  on  the  task  of  guarding  the  Emperor  while  the  surviving  body- guards engage the enemy. While awaiting the result, Uriel entrusts the protagonist with the Amulet of Kings, a special amulet that can only be worn by those of the Septim bloodline. He orders the player to take it  to  a  man  known  as  Jauffre.  Immediately  afterwards,  an  assassin ambushes  and  kills  the  emperor  before  he  is,  in  turn,  defeated.  The sole  surviving  guard,  Baurus,  questions  the  [gamer’s  avatar],  and explains that Jauffre is the Grandmaster of the Blades, and can be found at Weynon Priory. As the game progresses, it is revealed that the pro- longed lack of an Emperor has broken an old covenant, allowing mul- tiple gates to Oblivion to open, and a Daedric invasion is to begin as a result. The only way to close down the gates permanently is to ﬁnd someone of the Septim bloodline to retake the throne and re-light the Dragonﬁres in the Imperial City [Wikipedia, “Oblivion plot”].  Of course, the responsibility of ﬁnding a Septim heir and closing all the Obliv- ion gates ultimately falls to the gamer’s avatar. But the gamer can choose not to pursue this central storyline and simply wander in Cyrodiil, discovering other adventures. Thus, Oblivion offers both types of temporality  kairos and   106  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  Cyrodiil, Oblivion’s setting.  chronos  just as Morrowind does. The gameworld of Oblivion is expansive, offering  approximately  sixteen  square  miles  of  terrain  for  the  avatar  to explore. If the gamer wants to learn about Cyrodiil lore, there are approxi- mately 250 different books that can be located and read; some of these are the same as the books in Morrowind. Ultimately, Oblivion is a worthy descen- dant  of  the  massively  open-ended  roleplaying  experience  offered  in  Mor- rowind: it offers the same core gameplay experience while offering improved AI, physics, and graphics. But would any of these factors impact Tom, whose gaming history showed no tangible interest in avatar creation, development, or traditional roleplaying?  Choosing the Avatar’s Name, Race, and Sex  Even  though  Tom  had  no  history  of  v–RPG  avatar  identiﬁcation,  he  still took the initial creation of his avatar’s appearance at least as seriously as   4. Oblivion  107  Shiva and Vishnu had. Tom is a dark-haired Caucasian male of Scandina- vian descent. In Oblivion, the initial avatar creation of name, sex, race, and facial  appearance  happens  immediately  after  a  brief  cinematic.  Tom  spent almost  25  minutes  creating  his  avatar,  a  dark-haired  male  Nord  named “Tom.” Tom spent most of this time carefully adjusting the facial creation options, ultimately creating an avatar that looked remarkably like real-world Tom  from this point forward, to distinguish between Tom and his avatar “Tom,”  I’ll  refer  to  the  avatar  as  “virtual  Tom” .  Tom  conﬁrmed  he  was  trying  to  create  a  likeness  of  himself  in  our  post–Oblivion gaming  inter- view:  ZACH:  I’m  watching  you  create  your  avatar,  you  chose  a  Caucasian Nord, which is a dark haired, fair skinned race, and you named him “Tom.” Were you trying to create yourself ?  TOM: I was trying to do that the best I could. ZACH: Why? TOM: I didn’t ﬁnd the other options appealing. ZACH: But you didn’t really look at the other options, you only looked at one other race! You looked at the lizard Argonian, and then  Virtual Tom, initial creation.   108  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  just scanned a couple more. You didn’t even really look at all the racial options. Why not?  TOM: Because the ones that I saw as I was kind of scrolling through them, there were lots of animals and stuff like that, and I didn’t think that was representative of me.  ZACH:  So  it  was  in  some  ways  chance  that  the  Nord  male,  the  dark haired fair skinned race, happened to be the ﬁrst one that came up? That just kind of stuck in your mind and you said, “Oh, this is one I can kind of make look like me”?  TOM: I’d say that’s part of it, I’d also say just the idea that he seemed  Scandinavian. That’s where a lot of my ethnic roots are.  ZACH: Were you thinking the name itself, “Nord,” was kind of Nordic? TOM: Exactly. And that’s what my, not my ﬁrst name, Tom, but my last  name, is Nordic — Scandinavian.  ZACH: So why did you want to play as a Nordic, Scandinavian, white  Caucasian named Tom? TOM: I just wanted to be me. ZACH: You wanted your avatar to be as much like you in appearance  and name as possible?  TOM: Exactly. ZACH: Was that going to enhance your gameplay experience? Or would it  have  detracted  from  your  gaming  experience  if  you  were  a lizard named [a series of clicking sounds]. Or whatever. Would that have negatively impacted your gameplay?  TOM: I think for me it would have been harder to take the game seri- ously. If I hadn’t I don’t think I would have been able to get into it as much.  Here, Tom’s lack of a strong imagination prevented him from seriously considering any of the less human racial options. He clearly didn’t want to roleplay in the way Shiva enthusiastically did with her Dark Elf Witchhunter. However, Tom’s decisions here resulted in an avatar that he could identify quite closely with right from the beginning of the game. Whereas there was a  gendered,  racial,  and  name  discrepancy  between  Vishnu  and  Steve!  The Dark Elf female, Tom and virtual Tom were as closely aligned as was possi- ble at this point of Tom’s gaming experience. Tom’s only regret about this initial avatar creation process was that he didn’t realize he could change the hairstyle of his avatar. As a result, virtual Tom’s hairstyle, long and braided, didn’t mirror Tom’s own hair style  shorter and curlier  during his game- play.  Tom  admitted  he  had  overlooked  the  option  to  change  the  avatar’s  hairstyle, saying he didn’t realize it was possible until later in the game  when it was too late to go back and make any changes . Otherwise, virtual Tom and Tom were very similar in terms of name and appearance. In these identi- ﬁcatory aspects, Tom’s literalmindedness lead him to construct an avatar he could closely relate to.   4. Oblivion  109  Birthsign, Class, and Skills Selection  Whereas Morrowind allowed the gamer to select the avatar’s Class and Major Skills almost immediately  in the Census and Excise ofﬁce , Oblivion takes a different approach, allowing the gamer to act in the gameworld for a longer period of time before making these choices. After King Uriel Septim is killed in the catacombs under the prison and gives the avatar the Amulet of Kings and instructions to take it to Jauffre, the gamer must explore the remainder of the sewer system to discover the way out. This takes some time, with  many  opportunities  for  the  avatar  to  experiment  with  various  skills: ﬁghting with goblins  with both melee and ranged weapons , picking locks, sneaking in the darkness, and casting magical spells. When the avatar ﬁnally makes his way to the exit out of the sewers, the game displays the Class and Major Skills it has preselected for the avatar, based on how the gamer has cho- sen to play up to this point. For example, if the avatar repeatedly cast Fire- ball spells in combat, Destruction Magic would be selected as a Major Skill. But  the  gamer  is  not  obligated  to  keep  the  Class  and  Major  skills  recom- mended by the game; any class and or any Major Skills can be changed at this point. When virtual Tom reached this point, the game informed Tom that he was an Acrobat  a class that specialized in stealthy behavior  with the fol- lowing Major Skills: Blade, Block, Acrobatics, Marksman, Security, Sneak, and Speechcraft. Tom spent time here  approximately ﬁve minutes  considering all  the  other  classes  that  were  possible,  but  ultimately  chose  to  remain  an Acrobat. I asked him why:  TOM: Ultimately, as I went through all of those [Class choices], there were so many options, that I felt ill equipped. And so I thought the game was giving me the best advice.  ZACH: That’s in essence what they are trying to do there, saying that based on the way you’ve played this tutorial section of the game, these are the skills you’re using, maybe you like these skills, so here  is  the  class  that  would  go  with  those  Major  Skills.  You trusted that, and you didn’t want to branch out.  TOM: Right. I think in terms of the magic, I felt like maybe that would be balanced out by the Mage a little bit. As I was looking through those, I was trying to play out in my mind because of all of the different  options,  if  there  were  any  other  good  ﬁts  that  might give me an advantage, and I was just overwhelmed.  ZACH: So trust the game to give you the class that best represents what  you’ve done?  TOM: Right.  Two factors played a role in Tom’s decision here. First, his lack of expe- rience with this type of open-ended fantasy RPG meant he didn’t know which   110  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  Skills would be most beneﬁcial to virtual Tom. Second, Tom’s gaming pref- erences have shown that he has little patience for setting up his videogaming experiences and learning how to play preferring instead to play  and domi- nate  immediately. Tom lacked the patience to slowly and systematically look at each Class and the related Major Skills. He admitted when originally cre- ating virtual Tom that the special skills and traits available to Nords  each Race has different perks and abilities  were not a factor at all. In fact, Tom didn’t even know what they were. He had been solely focused on virtual Tom’s appearance. As a result, Tom was relieved to have Oblivion’s artiﬁcial intel- ligence select his Class and Major Skills for him.  In Tom’s explanation here, he mentions that the “Mage” was his attempt to incorporate magic into his avatar’s skill set. This refers to virtual Tom’s Birthsign. Avatar Birthsign selection had occurred earlier, while the avatar was  escorting  the  Emperor  through  the  catacombs.  At  one  point  prior  to  his fatal attack, the Emperor asks the avatar what sign he was born under, triggering  the  Birthsign  selection  screen.  Tom  spent  about  ﬁve  minutes  examining  the  possibilities  before  deciding  on  the  Mage,  which  according  to  the  in-screen  description,  “confers  a  permanent  bonus  of  50  points  to  your Magicka.” I found this choice interesting, given that Tom had not yet shown  any  interest  in  casting  spells  in  his  gameplay  to  that  point.  I  had assumed he wasn’t interested in the amount of strategic thinking that would be necessary to wield magic successfully, but his answer to my query surprised me:  ZACH: Can you tell me why [the Mage] was your choice, given that at  that point, you hadn’t really used your magicka much at all?  TOM: I enjoy magic in games. I really enjoy it. I played Baldur’s Gate.2 It’s not as involved as this, but in those I really enjoyed being able to step back away from people and destroy them from a dis- tance.  ZACH: And so your anticipation was that you’d increase the magicka with  the  birthsign,  and  even  though  you  haven’t  got  to  it  yet, down the road you’ll look forward to getting in and using mag- icka to kill people from afar.  TOM: Yes. And I also thought that maybe, because of the way the game was going, I knew that I was developing more of my corporal, physical skills, like the Sneaking and some of those other things, and I had done hand to hand combat, and so I think my char- acter was getting better with the blade, and so I didn’t know how the game was going to go, what opportunities I’d have to develop magic.  Tom’s past videogaming experiences  a combination of diegetic and extra- diegetic knowledge, similar to that displayed by Vishnu and Shiva  dictated   4. Oblivion  111  his decision to opt for a Birthsign that would help his magical abilities later in the game.  Learning the Gaming Interface and Selecting POV  At this point, Tom had established a clear videogaming identity: he had little interest in or patience for ﬁguring out how to play videogames, prefer- ring instead to dominate the game itself. Predictably, then, Tom expressed some frustration in having to learn the fairly complex Oblivion inventory sys- tem. In the inventory, there are several different “tabbed” menus that can be scrolled through. These show maps of the gameworld, current quests, and the avatar’s inventory of weapons, armor, clothing, potions, and other mis- cellaneous items. Figuring out where items are located and learning how to interpret all the symbols within each menu3 takes time. Tom admitted that this was difﬁcult for him to do; even after several hours of gameplay he said he struggled to remember where different items in his inventory were and what the various iconic symbols meant. When I suggested that some of his difﬁculties understanding and negotiating the inventory system could have been made easier if he had read the forty-seven-page Oblivion gaming man- ual ahead of time or at least referenced it while playing, Tom replied, “I don’t want to sit there and read it. I want to play it. I consider myself a tech-savvy person, and so I felt like I could ﬁgure it out. I would rather be in the game than reading about it.” I found this surprising, given Tom’s desire to domi- nate games; wouldn’t being as well-prepared for the gaming experience as pos- sible  make  it  easier  to  dominate  more  quickly?  In  this  case  Tom’s  lack  of initiative  won  out  over  his  wish  to  dominate.  As  a  result,  Tom  continued  to struggle with Oblivion’s complicated interface after several hours of gam- ing.  As Shiva had done with Shi, Tom chose to play virtual Tom through the ﬁrst-person POV almost exclusively. Only on one occasion did he switch to third-person POV: when crossing a high bridge between two towers. Tom said this was strictly a pragmatic decision: he wanted to make sure virtual Tom didn’t fall off and plummet to this death on the rocks below. As result, it  was  easier  for  Tom  to  see  if  his  feet  were  “lined  up”  with  the  bridge  by switching to third-person POV and rotating the camera angle directly above virtual Tom. Except for this careful bridge navigation, Tom remained in ﬁrst- person POV for the remainder of his gameplay. However, this was also a prac- tical  decision  for  Tom,  one  unrelated  to  identifying  with  his  avatar.  Tom explained that he found combat in third-person perspective difﬁcult, saying that he felt the avatar “got in the way” and that it was “harder to know what is going on” when ﬁghting in this perspective. So, this was a purely tactical   112  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  decision.  Even  as  Tom  had  spent  a  great  deal  of  time  making  sure  virtual Tom looked as much like him as possible, he had no great need to be able to view his avatar continually while exploring Cyrodiil. Of course, the avatar is immediately viewable upon entry into the inventory system, thus allowing ample opportunities for the gamer to visually connect and identify with the avatar. Tom entered the inventory 89 times during his gaming sessions for this project. This is much less than either Shiva or Vishnu, who both cared a great deal about making sure their avatars were using the best weapons and armor. Shiva also spent a great deal of time in the inventory examining the medicinal and magical properties of herbs and other ingredients so that she could create new potions. Tom expressed none of these interests. His trips into  the  inventory  menus  were  more  perfunctory:  he  studied  the  maps  to help orient virtual Tom in the gameworld and only occasionally equipped new weapons and armor as he came across them.  In fact, on several occasions virtual Tom was carrying armor and weapons in his inventory that were better than the items he was currently using. How- ever, Tom rarely bothered to look at his inventory items, only doing so when the items he was using became broken or when virtual Tom was struggling to stay alive. On these occasions, Tom looked through his inventory for foods and ingredients to eat to improve his health and for better weapons and armor. When I asked him why he didn’t take advantage of his inventory items more frequently,  it  became  clear  that  Tom’s  previous  videogaming  experiences hadn’t prepared him for this level of avatar control:  ZACH: Lots of decisions are possible in Oblivion: what armor you wear, what clothes you wear, what weapon you use, all the ingredients that you can pick up, and eat, or not eat. And a lot of those things impact how efﬁcient the play is. Have you chosen the best armor? The strongest weapon? When do you take your potions? Did you like having to negotiate all those things to play?  TOM: There was a lot there. I wasn’t used to making as many decisions as that. I was trying to learn the menus. I mean, there is a real learning  curve  with  this  game.  I  was  aware  of  what  dungeons and  dragons  is,  and  so  I  was  familiar  with  how  those  things worked,  but  there  was  a  real  learning  curve  with  learning  the menu,  with  learning  the  environment;  things  like  armor  were fairly frustrating. I didn’t want to spend a lot of time on those. I tried to pick the best weapon, and I knew that armor would be coming to me that would be better, the farther in I got.  ZACH: You knew that how? What made you think that would be true? TOM: Just based on experience from previous games. Because I know that the weapons and armor and things, the grade goes up as you go along. So there was a lot of that. With the food, I was aware of that, that that was a way to get health, but it took me a little   4. Oblivion  113  while. I remember with Alternate Reality, it does that too. When you  eat,  health  goes  up.  One  that  surprised  me,  a  little  bit,  I thought that the rats would be a great way to stock up on food, and it took me a little while to ﬁgure out that it would hurt me to eat rat meat. So it was something that I had to learn.  ZACH: Was having to distinguish between healthy and poisonous food  items particularly bad? Was it frustrating?  TOM: Actually, I just thought, “Okay, that makes sense.” You eat the good  food,  and  you  get  rid  of  the  bad  food.  Now  that  I  think about it, I wasn’t thinking about this at the time, I do have pre- vious experience with this, having played Gauntlet.  ZACH: “Warrior needs food.” TOM: Exactly! You can either get poison or you can get food.  It is clear here that Tom initially tried to draw on his previous experiences with Alternate Reality and Gauntlet  both games have dungeons and drag- ons-like fantasy settings  to inform his Oblivion choices. It is also clear that this didn’t work very well as Oblivion offers a much more complex interface and much greater freedom of choice than either of those older, less techno- logically-sophisticated games. Tom had no experiences with any more recent v–RPGs than Alternate Reality, which meant it had been more than twenty years since Tom had played a true roleplaying game. As a result, Tom wasn’t prepared for the high number of avatar choices required to succeed and “dom- inate” in Oblivion.  These combat-inﬂuenced situations weren’t the only times virtual Tom’s actions  were  dictated  by  Tom’s  Alternate  Reality experiences.  Shortly  after escaping from the sewers underneath the Imperial City’s prison, virtual Tom entered the Imperial City Market District, populated with shops where var- ious goods can be bought and sold. There, Tom chose to enter the Merchants Inn, where he rented a room so that virtual Tom could rest. As the game had not prompted Tom to do this, I was curious as to why he felt compelled to allow virtual Tom to sleep in a bed for eight hours. Tom revealed that his Alternate Reality experience had inﬂuenced this decision:  TOM: I had no idea what the time sequence was or how many days I  had been awake in the gameworld.  ZACH: But you still chose to go in and rest for eight hours. Why did  you do that?  TOM: I thought well, my character probably needs some rest, I can’t remember for sure at that point if there were any indicators on the character’s health or status that would tell me that I needed to. I just thought, “Well, I probably should.”  ZACH:  You  knew  you’d  been  wandering  in  those  caverns  for  awhile,  and so getting some rest for the avatar may replenish...  TOM: Whatever. Yeah. And that, once again, is reminiscent of the Alter-   114  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  nate Reality game, because you could do that, there was a speciﬁc inn you could go to, and you had to do that.  ZACH: What would that resting accomplish? What would it improve on  your avatar?  TOM:  It  would  improve  all  sorts  of  stuff.  It  could  improve  health,  if health was low. It could improve the ability to do the melee com- bat, because there were melee combat sequences you could do. And if you get too tired, you have trouble ﬁghting and also have trouble with health and other things.  ZACH:  That  is  kind  of  similar  to  how  Oblivion does  it.  Health  will replenish, fatigue will replenish, magicka will replenish. Yet you didn’t speciﬁcally know that those were going to happen when you rested.  TOM: No!  Here, Tom’s decision to rest actually did aid his Oblivion gameplay, as vir- tual Tom had been wounded in battles with goblins and rats in the sewers. Of course, Tom didn’t know resting would help heal his wounds, since he hadn’t bothered to read the game manual at all and the in-game tutorial mes- sages never mention it. Tom’s lack of relevant videogaming experiences cer- tainly seemed to hinder his identiﬁcatory Oblivion experience at times.  Avatar Ethics: Killing, Stealing, and Dying  Like Vishnu and Shiva, Tom looted corpses continually throughout vir- tual  Tom’s  wanderings  in  Cyrodiil.  Both  of  those  more  experienced v–RPGamers  had  clear  rationales  for  this  behavior;  they  believed  it  was expected of their avatars as a means to obtain “loot.” They also both made it clear that in this regard, their avatar’s ethics was different than their real- world ethics. I was curious to see if Tom had these same rationales for vir- tual Tom’s continual corpse looting:  ZACH: In your gameplay, you looted corpses freely. You had no qualms about taking items from dead bodies. Looting corpses! Did you have any ethical qualms about doing so?  TOM: No. ZACH: Why? Is that something you would do in non-virtual Tom’s life?  Would you be a corpse or grave robber?  TOM: Um, no. I think I did that just to be able to advance my charac-  ter.  ZACH: No qualm about whether this was unethical behavior? TOM: Right. Give me an advantage in the game. And not only that, I felt like, especially those ﬁrst bodies if I remember right, they were these assassins who had been sent to kill the emperor, and it seemed like they were the bad guys.   4. Oblivion  115  ZACH: So, it is okay to loot bad guys? But now Tom, you also looted the body of the guards who had been killed by those assassins. In the very same battle. Explain to me the difference, the distinc- tion. TOM: Um... ZACH: They are there protecting the emperor, at least one guard is killed there,  and  you  end  up  looting  him,  taking  some  armor  and weapon off of him.  TOM: There, I felt like I had to gain advantage, and I felt like that at some point, it seemed to me in the gameplay there was an oppor- tunity to follow the emperor and his guards and to participate with them. They obviously weren’t going to kill me.  ZACH: Why not? TOM: I felt like the emperor had already looked upon me favorably in some way, and so I felt like, well, if I’m going to follow them, I might as well be equipped to do so.  ZACH: So that justiﬁed taking the items off of the guard. TOM: If the emperor liked me and his guard’s stuff is sitting there use- lessly, I might as well use it. I identiﬁed more with the emperor than the guards.  ZACH: So the guards were discardable pieces you could take from freely. TOM: Yes. ZACH: Would that be the way non-virtual Tom would handle it? Would non-virtual Tom take items off of bodies if he thought that they were going to be helpful? Because you created a virtual Tom that looked like the non-virtual Tom and named him “Tom.” I guess I want to see where the distinction is between the avatar’s behav- ior and your behavior in this world. Were you playing it as “I would do this” if I was in the gameworld? Or was there a dis- tinction between the ethics?  TOM: I feel like non-virtual Tom has never been confronted with that option. And so, I don’t have any previous experience to draw on in order to do that.  ZACH: So if it was an experience in the game that you’d had previous experience  with  outside  of  the  game,  you’d  be  more  likely  to respond in the game based on how you responded here  the non- virtual world ?  TOM: I might. I think that’s my understanding of how I would be. But I  had  no  parallel  experience  [here],  because  I  haven’t  actually killed anybody or looted anybody.  Tom’s statement here about not having “any previous experience” reminds me of his explanation for why the driving experiences of Grand Theft Auto III had such an enduring impact on him. He drives often in real life, and there- fore can relate to the virtual experience of driving more intimately. If Obliv- ion’s gameworld and gameplay had more features and activities that Tom felt   116  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  like  he  had  experience  with,  would  his  identiﬁcation  with  this  type  of videogame increase? Of course, a fantasy setting and an epic, good-vs-evil plot are standard v–RPG conventions. It would be interesting to see how a casual gamer like Tom would identify with a v–RPG set in a more real-world setting that allowed for more simulatory, familiar experiences.  Even as Tom had no compunction about looting corpses in the wilder- ness,  he  displayed  a  very  different  ethical  sensibility  about  stealing  in  the Imperial  City.  Prior  to  visiting  the  Merchants  Inn,  Tom  wandered  in  the bazaar, opening various crates and boxes that were stacked there. Several of these containers held items of food and clothing, but Tom chose not to take any of these items, even though virtual Tom could have beneﬁted from many of them by selling or ingesting them. When I asked Tom why he would loot freely from the corpses he encountered or created in the sewers but not from these containers, he responded, “There are different rules in the city.” This was a fascinating response: why did Tom think this? Nothing in Tom’s game- play had informed Tom of this. Although the game’s manual explained the difference between the icons indicating which items, if taken, would be con- sidered theft  a red hand  and which would not  a clear hand , Tom of course had not read the manual, and indicated later he had no idea at this time what those icons meant. Yet for some reason he thought taking items from these bazaar chests would be considered stealing  which was not true in this case . Where did Tom get this idea? He explained why he had this belief:  TOM: What made me think that was the context. Because there, in the city, and I was just learning what was going on, and all of this stuff was just sitting out there in the open, and if I’m not mis- taken, it was right there by the shops that would have been sell- ing  it.  And  so,  I  wasn’t  familiar  yet  with  the  way  the  game indicates that something is going to be stealing. And at the begin- ning I just thought, “Oh, this is all just sitting out here in the open,” and then it dawned on me, that those shops are nearby, and it might belong to the people in the shops.  ZACH: So you’re applying a kind of logic to the gameworld. These are near the shops, so therefore they belong to the people who own the shops, so therefore it would be stealing.  TOM:  Yeah.  And  also  it  kind  of  reminded  me,  I  have  spent  time  in Europe, it reminded me of some of the markets and stuff that they have there, sitting outside. If stuff is sitting right outside the shop, usually it belongs to the shop.  Here,  Tom  is  directly  applying  his  non-virtual  experiences   extra-diegetic knowledge  to his diegetic decision. This is a clear example of how real-world experience informs virtual action.  Tom viewed the death of virtual Tom differently than either Shiva or   4. Oblivion  117  Vishnu had for their avatars. Shiva took her avatar’s death very seriously, and as a result Shi never died once during the Morrowind gameplay for this study. Vishnu merely saw his avatar’s death as a learning opportunity and remained fairly indifferent to Steve!’s death. Steve! died 26 times as a result of Vishnu’s diegetic experimentations. Virtual Tom died 23 times during Tom’s recorded gameplay. Perhaps predictably, the main emotion Tom felt when his avatar died was frustration:  ZACH: How did you view the death of your avatar when that would hap-  pen?  TOM:  I  thought,  well  the  ﬁrst  thing  I  thought  was,  “Did  I  save  the game?” And where did I save it, and did I have to go through all of that stuff again to get to where I was. And it took me awhile to start to save it again and again, after every single thing that happened.  Because  especially  at  the  beginning  there,  with  the training part  in the Imperial sewers , the tutorial, that was really easy. The rats would bite me and stuff but it didn’t hurt and when I got out there  through the Oblivion gate in Kvatch , I think the ﬁrst ones I fought were those little gremlin guys  scamps . Those killed me after a couple of strikes. And so, those scamps come up on me, and they were shooting ﬁreballs at me. I don’t remember having ﬁreballs shot at me before that point, and so I’ve got all this stuff going on. It took me awhile to adjust to the difﬁculty level I think.  ZACH: Inside the Oblivion gate, where things were tougher? TOM: Yeah. Inside my mind, I thought about how I was not as invin-  cible as I was in the tutorial.  ZACH: And was that frustrating, was that a challenge you enjoyed, that you didn’t enjoy? Was it traumatic, the death of Tom, the avatar who looks as much like you as possible?  TOM:  I  think  it  was  just  frustrating.  Because  I  thought,  this  Tom  is supposed to be able to just kill those guys and he’s not supposed to have this  getting killed  happen to him.  ZACH: Is he supposed to be able to just kill those guys? Or you wanted  him to be able to just kill those guys?  TOM: I wanted him to be able to kill those guys. So, You know when Tom died I didn’t really care because I knew it was a game, and I could just fall back on the previous save and do it again, but what was frustrating was just the fact that I knew I was dying. I wasn’t winning in the way I wanted to be.  Tom likes to dominate videogames; he likes to win them. His repeated death at the hands of ﬁreball-wielding scamps through the Kvatch Oblivion gate frustrated him enormously, as these deaths were a continual reminder that he was “failing” at the game. At least, this was Tom’s perception of what vir- tual  Tom’s  deaths  meant.  Tom  didn’t  like  the  fact  that  virtual  Tom  wasn’t   118  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  “invincible” in battle, even though he had been playing Oblivion for only a few hours at this point. If Tom had more experience with this type of v–RPG, his expectations might have been tempered. He would have known that his avatar was going to be relatively weak and vulnerable in combat early in the game. Of course, videogames like Mechwarrior had conditioned Tom to expect to be able to dominate right out of the gate, with different levels and difﬁculty settings. That he couldn’t do this in Oblivion bothered him. Once he realized how vulnerable virtual Tom was through the Oblivion gate, he began to save his game progress every few minutes  after almost any encounter of note . Tom  had  no  problem  killing  Oblivion’s  “bad  guys”:  the  assassins  who killed the emperor and the scamps and other monsters through the Oblivion gates. But Tom revealed different diegetic ethics when it came to killing other, more innocent characters in Cyrodiil. I pressed Tom speciﬁcally on this point to determine the connection between his diegetic and extra-diegetic ethical decisions.  On  several  occasions,  Tom  had  encountered  NPCs  who  had weapons, armor, and items that were better than what virtual Tom was cur- rently carrying. I asked Tom why he hadn’t killed those NPCs so that he could improve virtual Tom’s status:  ZACH: Would you kill an innocent in a game, to give yourself an advan-  tage?  TOM: I think I would have qualms. ZACH: Tell me why. TOM: This would kind of go back to the beggar woman, and choosing the forces of light or darkness. I would think that based on the choice  I  made  before  I  would  want  to  choose  the  light  side.  I might try to barter with the person.  ZACH: Let’s say that’s not an option. But they’ve got just the perfect piece  of  armor  you  want.  What  would  keep  you  from  killing them? Would it be your expectation that the gaming system will reward  you  for  that  decision?  Or  your  fear  that  it  will  punish you? Or just your own personal moral code?  TOM: I think it would have to do with my moral code. ZACH:  Tom  the  avatar,  he  could  be  just  a  vicious  murdering  villain.  What would stop you from playing it that way?  TOM: I think like the beggar woman, I think I would feel bad about if  I just killed someone for their stuff.  ZACH: It sounds to me like you’re saying it’s a moral thing, that you would feel bad. That doesn’t sound like very much separation between Tom, and virtual Tom, in terms of morals. They’re the same.  TOM: I would agree with that.  Here is a fascinating instance where Tom either can’t or won’t make a dis- tinction between himself and virtual Tom: neither of them is willing to kill   4. Oblivion  119  someone who doesn’t seem to deserve it. The “beggar woman” in this pas- sage refers to a woman Tom encountered just after he escaped from the sew- ers under the Imperial Prison and entered the Imperial City Market District. At this very early stage of his gameplay, virtual Tom hadn’t yet acquired much money. And yet when the old beggar woman asked him for some coins, Tom gave her some gold. When I asked him why, he explained that he had been once again inﬂuenced by Alternate Reality:  TOM: based on some of my past experience, I told you about Alternate Reality,  I  know  that  you’ve  got  choices  you  can  make,  in  that game,  and  the  choices  that  you  make  determine  whether  you head toward the forces of light or darkness. That determines what sorts of guilds you can join, what sorts of spells you can get. And so,  for  me,  that  was  a  choice  that  was  reminiscent  of  that  old game.  ZACH: Your thought process being, you’re going the “light” route by giving her coins, and that is going to unlock possibilities for your avatar that might be different than if you...  TOM: ...killed her. ZACH: So it’s the old light Jedi, dark Jedi, opportunities down those dif- ferent paths. So you wanted to be the light Jedi? Why? Where is the fun in that?  TOM: [Laughs.] You know, I have to be honest, I probably didn’t think about that too horribly much. It was kind of a reaction. I think I might have felt bad if I had killed her.  ZACH: She’s not real. TOM: I know. ZACH: Or is she? Is that real-world Tom, unconsciously making that decision? Rather than thinking that virtual Tom can do what- ever the hell he wants and it will be okay?  TOM: Yeah, I think it was something of an emotional reaction.  Tom begins by attributing his decision to his past Alternate Reality experi- ences, but it quickly became apparent that he simply didn’t ﬁnd it ethical to kill the beggar woman. Tom reacted emotionally, instinctively following his real-world moral code. There was no distinction between his ethics and his avatar’s ethics in this situation.  Diegetic Experimentation, Gameworld Exploration,   and Narrative Immersion  Even as he expressed little interest in ﬁguring out how to be successful in Cyrodiil, Tom still did show evidence of experimentation through virtual Tom’s  actions.  One  example  of  this  diegetic  experimentation  came  in  the Imperial City’s Market District just after virtual Tom had emerged from his   120  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  slumber in the Merchants Inn. Upon entering Jensine’s “Good as New” Mer- chandise  a shop selling exactly what its name suggests , virtual Tom spoke brieﬂy to the proprietor Jensine about her wares. The avatar’s next actions were intriguing: virtual Tom went up the stairs in Jensine’s shop, where Jen- sine’s personal living quarters were. As Jensine’s shop was open for business, the door to her private quarters was locked. Nevertheless, virtual Tom picked the lock on this door and entered her living quarters. Jensine promptly called for  the  city  watch,  and  a  guardsman  arrived.  Virtual  Tom  was  summarily arrested for breaking and entering. I asked Tom to explain why he wasn’t will- ing to take items out of the bazaar chests  because of the “different rules” in the city  but had no problem breaking into a woman’s home:  ZACH: So tell me about the discrepancy between “there are rules in the city for me to not take the stuff out of the boxes” in the bazaar but you’re going to go upstairs and pick a lock in someone’s pri- vate residence. How is that okay?  TOM: Um... [at a loss for words] ZACH: Because the picking of the lock seems more egregious to me than taking  an  item  out  of  a  chest  in  a  plaza  when  there  is  no  one around. Whereas, Jensine’s right downstairs, it’s clear she doesn’t want you to go in there, and you do it anyway. And it did say on the screen, “Pick the lock.” So that implies that it’s not open, that you’re going to have to use a thief ’s tool to get in. Explain!  TOM:  Right.  I  think  I  would  say  that,  I  could  go  anywhere,  and  she doesn’t stop me from going upstairs or anything like that, and when  I  got  there,  there  wasn’t  any  indication  that  I  would  be doing something wrong. I don’t think. No sort of overt indica- tion.  ZACH: Nor was there any overt indication that anything would be wrong  if you took stuff out of those boxes [in the bazaar].  TOM: Right. But to me that’s wrong. That’s stealing. ZACH: Okay. But is breaking and entering a lesser crime? Or you didn’t  consider that breaking and entering when you did it?  TOM: I didn’t necessarily consider that breaking and entering, and then I didn’t steal anything. I felt like it was clear to me that if I’d taken something  [it  would  be  a  crime].  I  was  surprised  when  I  was arrested!  ZACH: I see. You weren’t aware that you’d done anything wrong. TOM: Right. I wasn’t aware. I just didn’t think about it in those terms. I’m  trying  to  think  of  any,  are  there  any  examples  I  can  draw from previous gameplay.  ZACH: Where just entering a location would be a criminal activity? TOM: It’s possible, yeah. ZACH: So you were thinking if you can enter, they must want you to  go in there.  TOM: Yeah. It must be okay to go in. There is something about being   4. Oblivion  121  able to go where you want to, despite her [Jensine]. And it’s kind of funny, because it does feel like private space, and I thought it was a way to tease a character, push her buttons or whatever.  ZACH:  But  you  didn’t  think  there  would  be  legal  ramiﬁcations  from  doing so.  TOM: Right. There is something about, how far can I push her. A little  test. How far can I push her?  It is interesting that Tom describes this diegetic experimentation not in terms of testing the gameworld, but of testing “her,” meaning Jensine. As I’m sure you’ve noticed, Tom also refers to virtual Tom’s actions and decisions in the ﬁrst person: “How far can I push her?” This shows close identiﬁcation between Tom and his avatar — even as this identiﬁcation seems to often be uncon- scious  on  Tom’s  part.  Both  Shiva  and  Vishnu  also  seemed  to  at  times  be unaware of the connections between their extra-diegetic selves and the deci- sions they made for their virtual selves.  Another instance where Tom showed enjoyment of diegetic experimen- tation came early in his gameplay while virtual Tom was still in the sewers under the Imperial City prison. In order to give the avatar as many different experiences as possible during this tutorial portion of the game, several dif- ferent weapons can be found and used. Soon enough in his explorations, vir- tual Tom found a bow and arrows near a well. There is a bucket hanging from a rope over the well, and a tutorial message appears on the screen, explain- ing how to target and ﬁre with the bow. The game instructs the user to prac- tice ﬁring arrows at the bucket. Tom did so, carefully lining up his ﬁrst shot and hitting the bucket squarely with his arrows. This sent the bucket wildly swinging back and forth on the rope it hung from. When this happened, Tom laughed out loud: a rare display of emotion from a man not known for many demonstrative emotional reactions. I asked Tom what it was about this expe- rience that caused such a  for him  strong reaction. He replied that he had found it “satisfying to know that I could actually control the bow well enough to actually hit something. It was the ﬁrst shot! It felt like a weapon that would be useful and easy to use.” Tom reacted favorably to his ﬁrst bow-and-arrows experience because he was able to succeed at it immediately and easily. This reaction is completely in keeping with Tom’s preestablished gaming prefer- ences, and this was really the ﬁrst time in his Oblivion gameplay where Tom perceived he had “mastered” a skill immediately. It was also one of the last times, as the type of gameplay Oblivion offers isn’t set up to allow for the avatar to dominate in the way Tom would have liked. After all, this is no Mechwar- rior. Tom never laughed like this again during his gaming sessions for this project. Too many Scamps throwing ﬁreballs, most likely.  One other aspect of Tom’s gaming experience for this project that was   122  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  interesting was his complete disinterest in the game’s narrative. Even as nei- ther Vishnu nor Shiva had closely followed the Morrowind central narrative plot during their gameplay, both gamers had remained adamant that a good story was essential to their favorite videogaming experiences. Those experi- enced v–RPGamers had been able to create ongoing narratives for their avatars as they explored Vvardenfell. Both gamers also admitted that they were ulti- mately interested in uncovering Morrowind’s main plot; they just wanted to do some exploring ﬁrst. Tom expressed none of these narrative interests. Like Morrowind, Oblivion begins with an opening cinematic, with voice-over nar- ration  from  Emperor  Uriel  Septim   voice  acted  by  Patrick  Stewart  of  Star Trek: the Next Generation fame . This cinematic runs for approximately thirty seconds, but Tom only watched for three seconds before pushing the button on his gamepad that skipped the rest of this introductory cinematic. I asked why he did this: did the game’s story not matter to him?  TOM: I wanted to play the game. I don’t have a lot of patience for the  cutscenes and stuff like that.  ZACH: Even though, didn’t you suspect that the opening cutscene would try to establish some sort of narrative story or mood? Would that have been your expectation?  TOM: I thought that it would, but I also had the expectation that the game itself would, in little cutscenes as I would complete levels. ZACH:  So  you  didn’t  feel  like  watching  the  cutscene  was  going  to  enhance your gameplay experience at all.  TOM: No.  It  is  easy  to  see  here  that  Tom’s  previous  gaming  experiences  lead  to  false assumptions about what his Oblivion experience is going to be like. He clearly is expecting deﬁnitive levels or stages as is typical of many action and FPS games, and he assumes there will be additional cinematics between these lev- els. Both assumptions are wrong. Oblivion has no levels to speak of. To be sure, entering new locations like forts, caves, and cities requires a few sec- onds of a wait-while-the-game-loads screen, but no cinematics occur. The plot is relayed in dialogue with crucial NPCs in-game. Later in this inter- view, Tom went on to admit that he really didn’t care about the game’s story anyway. His goal in playing, he said, was to “advance the game.” In my own videogaming experiences, “advancing the game” is closely tied to furthering the game’s narrative arc. I asked Tom what he meant by this advancement. He stressed that he wanted to “advance the quest. Not necessarily the story, to draw that distinction. I would want to get to the next level, and I wouldn’t care about the story.” Tom went on to explain that he was only interested in the quests related to the main narrative because he knew that these quests would give him speciﬁc things to do: that there would be items to locate or   4. Oblivion  123  bad guys to ﬁght. Tom wanted exciting quests to be as easy as possible to  ﬁnd; he didn’t want to have to wander in Cyrodiil looking for important loca- tions.  In my opinion, that was Tom’s loss: Cyrodiil is vast, and is rendered in gorgeous visual detail. There are mountains to climb, lakes to swim in, forests to hunt deer in, and many dozens of caves, Elven ruins, forts, and cities to explore. Gameworld exploration and discovering secret locations is one of the great draws for most v–RPG fans; wandering on foot can really aid immer- sion and gaming identiﬁcation as I discussed in earlier chapters. But I dis- covered that Tom just didn’t care about exploring the gameworld. This was immediately illustrated by the very ﬁrst quest given to virtual Tom by the dying  Emperor:  deliver  the  Amulet  of  Kings  to  Jauffre  in  Weynon  Priory. After his rest at the Merchants Inn and his brief diegetic experimentation in the Market District of the Imperial City, Tom accessed his inventory to exam- ine the world map to locate Weynon Priory. When Tom located the priory and moved the cursor over it, he was given the option of “Fast Travelling” to Weynon Priory. In Oblivion, the avatar has two means of traveling through Cyrodiil. One is to simply walk run through the world on foot  or on a horse . This takes time, but offers the advantage of really seeing the virtual game- world with the possibility of discovering new locations that don’t yet appear on the avatar’s map. Initially, the avatar’s map only shows the major cities of Cyrodiil  the Imperial City, Kvatch, Anvil, Bravil, Bruma, Cheydinhal, Chor- ral,  Skingrad,  and  Leyawiin   and  a  few  locations  the  avatar  has  been  told about by NPC conversations, like Weynon Priory. All of the rest of the numer- ous ruins, caves, forts, mines, and Oblivion gates must be discovered by the avatar through exploration of the world. However, Tom immediately chose the Fast Travel option from the Imperial City to Weynon Priory. In effect, this “teleports” the avatar immediately to the desired location, allowing the user to skip the travel time. No random encounters with bandits or monsters will occur along the way, but neither will additional locations on the map be discovered. From Weynon Priory, the avatar is instructed by Jauffre to travel to the city of Kvatch to locate Brother Martin. Tom again selected the Fast Travel option from the priory to Kvatch. I asked Tom why he didn’t want to experience moving through Cyrodiil to arrive at these locations:  TOM:  I  didn’t  have  patience  with  the  map.  I  didn’t  want  to  have  to ﬁgure out where I was in relation to the map, and then ﬁnd the path. I know there is that little indicator on the compass, but I ﬁgured I don’t want to spend all this time meandering on some path when I could advance the story.  ZACH: So that’s what it was all about? Advancing the story? Getting the  quest, then moving to the next quest location after that?   124  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  TOM: Yes. ZACH: But at the same time, when talking to those quest characters, like Martin in the chapel in Kvatch and Jauffre in Weynon Pri- ory, and other characters that you had to talk to to get the new quests, you were always impatient it seemed to me going through the conversations with them. You skipped through lots of nar- rative exposition.  TOM: Yes. ZACH: That makes me think it wasn’t really about the story at all, but  rather the quest. Is that accurate?  TOM: I would say that probably just to be able to see what comes next. I know in the story, it’s a narrative that has a structure to it, but as you say I didn’t really care about that.  ZACH: It sure didn’t seem like it, after skipping that opening cutscene, jumping through the dialogues quickly to get to “what’s the quest I have to do.”  TOM: Right. That would give me opportunities to get some action. At least in my mind, that’s where the action was. And I wanted the game  to  give  that  to  me,  I  didn’t  want  to  spend  a  lot  of  time meandering on the paths to see what other things were there. I wanted there to be something there, and I knew the quests would give that to me.  It should be clear by now that Tom doesn’t want to struggle with his video- gaming  experiences,  and  the  gameworld-exploration-for-the-sake-of-the- exploration  that  intrigues  so  many  videogamers  only  frustrates  Tom.  He wants clear tasks to do  preferably tasks that virtual Tom can complete eas- ily .  Remember,  most  of  Tom’s  gaming  history  is  with  action-oriented videogames  with  distinctive  levels  that  begin  and  end — and  more  impor- tantly, that can be learned and mastered. Oblivion resists this paradigm, offer- ing  instead  a  virtual  space  to  inhabit  and  explore.  Tom  resisted  this opportunity. Instead, he chose to Fast Travel from one Important Quest Loca- tion to another eschewing Cyrodiil exploration:  TOM: I did not like to have to navigate! ZACH: You would want to go from one quest spot to another. So you didn’t really care about the world, the big open-ended world: if you can see it in the environment, you can get there. That explo- ration meant nothing?  TOM: I didn’t want to do that. Even in the town, where you’ve got all these little shops, you know there are all of these things that you can do, I thought about going to some of those because I wanted to upgrade my armor, I knew that I had some gold and maybe I can sell some things, but I didn’t want to have to ﬁnd it. And there were names on some of the shops that didn’t necessarily tell you what was in each shop. And that to me was frustrating. That’s where I decided to just leave the city.   4. Oblivion  125  In  traditional  action  games   such  as  Tom’s  favorite  Mechwarrior ,  there  is very little down time between action spots in levels. The excitement remains consistently high throughout a level; the adrenaline often does as well. Obliv- ion exploration offers many quiet, more sedate moments where there are no monsters to ﬁght. For Tom, wandering to the top of a mountain, picking the mushrooms found there, and gazing down at the panoramic view of Cyrodiil isn’t an exciting or immersive videogaming experience. Tom wanted action, and the satisfaction of completing dominating winning speciﬁc quests.  Avatar Identiﬁcation  Ultimately, how did Tom’s gaming predilections and personality affect his identiﬁcation with virtual Tom? After he completed the required hours of Oblivion gameplay for this project, I asked Tom if he would continue to play the game on his own time. He said that he would, but likely only as long as the main quest kept giving him speciﬁc tasks to do. After that, he would probably stop playing, not being proactive enough to want to ﬁnd other inter- esting things to do and places to visit. Tom  both virtual and non-virtual  lacked the initiative and imagination to undergo this exploration if given the choice.  Indeed,  this  wasn’t  the  only  area  where  Tom’s  identity  overlapped with  virtual  Tom’s.  I’ve  already  discussed  Tom’s  explanations  for  how  he justiﬁed looting corpses but not containers in civilization along with his moral qualms about killing NPCs he believed to be “innocent.” These were clearly instances where Tom was reacting to the virtual world just as he would to similar situations in the non-virtual world. And many of Tom’s diegetic deci- sions   deciding  to  Fast  Travel,  to  sleep  in  a  bed  at  the  Merchants  Inn,  to assume the items in the Market District bazaar were owned by the shopkeep- ers  were unquestionable inﬂuenced by his extra-diegetic experiences. Was virtual Tom as “real” to Tom as Shi was to Shiva? No. Not even close. But there were areas where the distinctions between Tom and virtual Tom were deliciously blended. This was revealed by the ﬁnal questions I asked Tom in our post–Oblivion gaming interview:  ZACH: Who did you want Tom to be? When I say Tom, I mean [vir-  tual] Tom. What was your goal for Tom?  TOM: As I was creating Tom, I was trying to create me. You know, I  didn’t think that I could create my own face. [Laughs.] ZACH: You came pretty close, actually. I was pretty impressed. TOM: I took it as far as I could go. If I had knew that the hair [cus- tomization] was there, I would have tried to at least match the texture of my hair. But I would say for that I was at least trying to replicate my race, my northern European roots. And so, when I was doing that I was thinking about how I imagine northern   126  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  Europeans to be. I’ve got a lot of northern European blood in my veins. I tried to make it look more like me and my people, I guess.  ZACH: So that’s in the creation. What about when the game starts? Did you have any thoughts about who you wanted Tom to be or was that never a factor? Or was it all about quest advancement?  TOM: I would say it was about quest advancement. ZACH: But you didn’t want Tom to be a murderer, it doesn’t sound like,  killing innocent people.  TOM: No, you’re right. I didn’t want to do that. ZACH: So you did have a sense of something beyond just quests. TOM:  Possibly.  I  didn’t  necessarily  want  Tom  to  do  things  that  I  wouldn’t do. Maybe it depends on what you mean by, “to be.”  ZACH: To be a law abiding citizen, to be a grave robber, to be some- body who would ﬁght for justice, or the opposite, none of those types of things were in your head as you were playing.  TOM: Not necessarily. No. I mean, just the moral part. If I was faced  with those choices, I wouldn’t want to kill somebody.  ZACH: Except scamps. TOM: Except scamps. In the real world, if I make a distinction between my avatar and real-world Tom, I think the choices are different, and when I think about what I want my person, my character in the world to be versus what I want myself to be, I’ve got real-life goals that can’t be realized in the game. And so I wasn’t think- ing about my identity in that sense. But it does make sense when you remind me that I was acting morally.  Even  as  there  were  many  obvious  distinctions  between  Tom  and  his avatar,  they  still  shared  much  commonality.  They  shared  a  name.  Their appearances  and  ethnicities  were  similar   as  much  as  was  possible .  They shared certain moral codes, with neither wishing to openly steal or kill. On several occasions when trying to explain the distinction between virtual Tom’s behavior and his own, Tom stressed that he had no experiences like the ones virtual Tom was having  deciding to loot corpses, kill a person in self defense, or break into a woman’s home  and therefore didn’t know how closely he was identifying with his avatar. This excuse seems a bit of a cop-out to me, a per- haps  unconscious  resistance  to  admitting  to  identifying  with  the  virtual avatar. Both Shiva and Vishnu were also occasionally unaware of how some of their diegetic choices revealed their connectedness to their avatars. With those two diehard gamers, my questions during the post-gaming interviews usually made them aware of these connections. Shiva in particular seemed comfortable  admitting  her  signiﬁcant  identiﬁcation  with  Shi.  Vishnu  was slightly less willing, but still acknowledged how closely tied to his non-vir- tual identity his diegetic decisions for Steve! were. Tom was much more resist- ant to the notion that virtual Tom and Tom shared many traits. This resistance   4. Oblivion  127  remained  even  when  our  post-gaming  interview discussion  revealed  these commonalities. It seems to me that for many videogamers, a large portion of their  identiﬁcation  with  their  virtual  avatars  happens  unconsciously:  Tom wasn’t even aware why he didn’t take items from the bazaar chests until I asked him about it and forced him to consciously explain his decision. Similarly, Vishnu initially wasn’t even aware that he was accumulating Morrowind books without reading them until I asked him about it. Each of these participants had to make diegetic decisions continually when gaming: some of these deci- sions seemed willful and performative while others seemed unconscious and automatic. In terms of identity, this makes perfect sense. Each of us is moti- vated to act by tangible external and internal stimuli, but also by unconscious conditioning driven by our desires and past experiences.  Diehard  gamers  Vishnu  and  Shiva  both  identiﬁed  more  strongly  with their avatars than casual videogamer Tom. They were also more willing to consciously  take  ownership  of  the  connections  between  their  diegetic  and extra-diegetic actions, decisions, and morals. Tom continually used the fan- tasy  setting  of Oblivion as  an  excuse  not  to  willfully  identify  with  virtual Tom’s actions. I was curious to see if a v–RPG that had a more realistic set- ting might make it easier for a user to identify with the gameworld and the avatar’s options. I was also curious to see how a non-gamer  someone who not only didn’t enjoy roleplaying games, but who didn’t play videogames as a rule at all  would identify with her avatar. Would there be more merger or division if the gamer in question had even fewer videogaming experiences to draw  on  to  aid  in  avatar  identiﬁcation?  Fortunately,  an  epic  v–RPG  had recently been released that wasn’t set in a fantasy world. This game is Fall- out  3,  set  in  Washington,  D.C.,  in  the  year  2277.  Fallout  3 offers  a  future dystopian vision of a post-apocalyptic wasteland of America’s capital city and the surrounding countryside. Familiar national landmarks like the Jefferson Memorial and the Washington Monument are surrounded by the bombed- out ruins of the city’s neighborhoods. Mutated humans and animals wander the wastes. Would this familiar yet futuristic setting aid the identiﬁcation of a non-gamer? To ﬁnd out, I turned to my ﬁancée Bianca  a decidedly non- videogamer  to see how her lack of videogaming experiences and disinterest in virtual identities and worlds would impact the diegetic choices she made for her avatar in the Capital Wasteland of Fallout 3.   5  Fallout 3  Identity and the Non-Gamer  My ﬁancée Bianca, 32 years old at the time of this study, is a child psy- chiatrist.  She  is  a  non-videogamer,  as  you’ll  soon  discover.  However,  this doesn’t mean that she has never played videogames. Like so many of us who were children growing up in the early eighties, Bianca was exposed to Atari and Nintendo as a child. The youngest of four children, Bianca has two older sisters  between  her  and  her  eldest  sibling,  a  brother  ten  years  older  than Bianca. When I asked her about her childhood videogaming experiences, she explained that she was ﬁrst exposed to Atari when she was six or seven. Her brother was still living at home at that time, and he had an Atari then. As was the case with Shiva and her older brother, Bianca watched her brother play on the Atari ﬁrst, which made her want to play. Indeed, Vishnu as well had been drawn to videogames as a result of his older brother. How often, I won- der, are our own childhood interests dictated by the interests of a big brother or big sister? Certainly, all the participants in this study were ﬁrst introduced to videogames by siblings.  Bianca’s Videogaming History  Bianca couldn’t remember which Atari system her brother had, but in all likelihood it was the Atari 2600, as the games she remembers playing on it are Adventure and Pitfall. Of course, Bianca couldn’t remember the names of either of these games, describing Adventure as “the one where you went through different castles, with the keys and the dragons” and Pitfall as “the one  where  he  goes  over  crocodiles  and  everything.”  Other  than  these  two games, Bianca couldn’t remember playing any other Atari games at all. When I asked her what it was about these two games that made them enjoyable  and therefore memorable , her ﬁrst response was that she had been playing them with her cousins  who were near her own age . Like Tom, Bianca remem- bered the social aspect of her childhood videogaming as most important to  128   5. Fallout 3  129  the fun of playing videogames. Bianca remembered that a Nintendo system  certainly  the  NES   came  into  her  home  when  she  was  around  ten.  Her brother was still living at home then as well, saving money while attending college,  but  Bianca  stressed  that  he  didn’t  really  have  time  to  play  video- games then as a pre–Med major. Instead, her friends at school had spurred her interest in the Nintendo: “I think we had it because our friends had it. I don’t  remember  speciﬁcally  asking  for  it.”  As  with  the  Atari,  Bianca  only remembers playing on the Nintendo when her friends or cousins were over; she couldn’t remember ever playing alone, with no one watching. The two games she remembered playing on the NES were Super Mario Bros. and The Legend  of  Zelda.  Without  the  social  beneﬁts  of  bonding  with  friends  and family, Bianca likely would have never played videogames during these early years.  Bianca  stopped  playing  videogames  when  she  entered  high  school;  in fact, she claims to have no memories of ever playing videogames during high school, college, or medical school. When I asked her why, she replied that she “had other things that were more interesting for me to do, like go to the mall with my friends or study.” That Bianca found studying “more interest- ing” than playing videogames says a lot about her she viewed videogames at this point in her life. Since I’ve entered Bianca’s life, she’s had a little more exposure  to  videogaming,  which  has  resulted  in  a  three  trips  to  the  local video arcade in the past four years. Despite the advances in videogame tech- nology  since  Bianca  was  in  middle  school,  most  of  her  time  in  the  arcade when we have gone is spent in the “classic” gaming section, playing Pac-Man and  Frogger for  approximately  ten  minutes  each.  The  only  “modern” videogames Bianca shows any interest in are simulatory racing games that have a steering wheel and foot pedals. Yet after twenty minutes or so, Bianca grows bored even with racing games, and we leave the arcade.  What  keeps  Bianca  from  playing  videogames  now?  There  is  plenty  of opportunity.  I  play  videogames  as  often  as  I  can,  owning  an  Xbox  360,  a Playstation 2, and a Nintendo Wii. Why doesn’t some of my videogaming passion rub off on Bianca? In the pre-gaming interview discussing her child- hood gaming experiences, Bianca revealed several different preferences that explain why videogames hold no interest for her anymore. Here, she describes why The Legend of Zelda was her favorite videogame:  BIANCA: I had the most fun playing it. ZACH: Why? BIANCA: Because it was interesting and I had a really positive associa- tion with that game. It was new, it was novel at the time to me, and I liked the different platforms that you played on.  ZACH: What does that mean?   130  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  BIANCA: Just the different screens, and how cool they were. I thought the character, what they were able to do, was exciting at the time in the sense of the places they went.  ZACH: So there is some exploration of the kingdom, the land? BIANCA: Yes. I liked that. But I think there was also a sense of mastery. I was able to master the game and do well. Me and my cousin were both good at it. Once I really got into it, we could spend hours playing. I remember I played a lot of it with my cousin there, and I got to the end and I ﬁnished the game with my cousin watching.  ZACH: But you didn’t start out being a master of Zelda; it took awhile to get the hang of it. So how did you get through those ﬁrst few hours?  BIANCA: Hanging out with my cousins and friends. ZACH: The social aspect. BIANCA: Yes. And learning their skills too. ZACH: Watching them play, and learning from that, was helpful too? BIANCA: Yeah. And I think I was just more stimulated with videogames  back then. They just interested me more.  ZACH: So, I’m hearing that several things were a factor in you liking Zelda the best: the exploration of the different types of the world, the different screens and sections, were interesting to you.  BIANCA: Uh-huh. ZACH: That you were able to master the game, that was important, and that it was a good social bonding experience with your cousin.  BIANCA: Yes. ZACH: All three of those things equally contributing to that being your  most memorable videogaming experience?  BIANCA: What were the three again? ZACH:  The  exploration  of  the  different  parts  of  the  gameworld,  that you had good mastery of the game, and that you were also social- izing.  BIANCA:  Yeah.  All  of  those  equally.  But  probably  mastery  being  the  most important.  ZACH: That was important to you? You like to master things? BIANCA: Yeah, I’m a perfectionist.  Bianca makes it clear here that she enjoys mastering things with videogames being  no  exception.  She’s  similar  to  Tom  in  this  regard:  neither  of  them derives  any  joy  out  of  learning  how to  play  a  videogame.  In  fact,  both  of them ﬁnd this learning curve frustrating. For Bianca part of the appeal of clas- sic video arcade games is the simple joystick-and-button control mechanism. She explained her preference for the Atari 2600 joystick over even the NES’ simple gamepad:  BIANCA: I think it [the Atari joystick] is easier to play. I feel like I’m  more in control.   5. Fallout 3  131  ZACH: The Xbox 360 has multiple buttons, for example. BIANCA: I guess I don’t feel comfortable because I don’t know the con-  ZACH: There was a time when you didn’t know the Atari either. BIANCA: It is easier to learn. Even the Nintendo was easy to learn. ZACH:  So  you  feel  that  modern  games  require  you  to  deal  with  too  trols.  many buttons?  BIANCA: They take longer. I don’t have the patience to learn it. ZACH: You don’t have the patience? You have enormous patience. You have  a  medical  degree,  which  indicates  you  have  incredible patience to study and focus your mind on something that you want to learn.  BIANCA: The incentive is different! [In videogames] I have no incen-  tive beyond hitting one button to play a game.  Bianca isn’t interested in learning a complex gaming interface, claiming she lacks the patience to learn sophisticated control schemes. This is one of the reasons why her enjoyment of videogames today begins and ends with twenty- minute  bursts  of  classic  arcade  gaming.  These  are  games  with  simple  joy- sticks  and  usually  no  more  than  a  button  or  two.  Ironically,  most  arcade videogames cannot be mastered or completed; they’re designed so that the player  will  lose die  sooner  rather  than  later.  For  Bianca,  “mastery”  in  this case means mastery of the gaming controls along with mastery of how the game is to be played. Frogger is a good example of the type of arcade game Bianca likes to play: only the joystick is used to navigate the frogs through the obstacles into the safe zones at the top of the screen. No new gameplay aspects need to be learned after the very ﬁrst level. Certainly, the difﬁculty of the levels increase, but the basic gameplay mechanic does not. In Frogger  and most other arcade games , learning how to play the game takes no more than a minute. For Bianca, this is essential to her enjoyment of videogames. I asked her what variables would stop her from playing a videogame  other than an arcade game  that she had started. After all, she had completed both Zelda and Super Mario Bros.:  ZACH: What would stop you playing a videogame? BIANCA: Unable to master. ZACH: Meaning, the skills needed? BIANCA: Yes. Lack of patience in learning the complexity of the joystick. ZACH: Is there another aspect that you’d be worried you couldn’t mas-  ter other than just what buttons to push when? BIANCA: Maybe, the storyline. Like how complex it is. ZACH: Being able to follow the storyline? BIANCA: Yes. ZACH: What about being able to care about the storyline? BIANCA: Exactly. More that.   132  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  Bianca  not  only  conﬁrms  here  her  lack  of  interest  in  complicated  gaming interfaces but also reveals another reason why she is a non-gamer: she has almost no interest in stories or ﬁctional narratives. As I soon found out, this led to her disinterest in not only videogames, but also movies and novels:  ZACH: Do you have any interest in videogames that have a narrative arc or story, something like a movie has, with ups and downs, twists and turns, surprising developments? Would that interest you in a videogame?  BIANCA: No. ZACH: Why not? BIANCA: It bores me. ZACH: What? You don’t like interesting stories? BIANCA: Correct. ZACH: You don’t like a narrative in a good book? BIANCA: Nope. ZACH: What about in a movie? BIANCA: Yeah, I like it in a movie. ZACH: What is the difference between the narratives you like in movies and not liking them in books or not having any interest in try- ing them in a videogame?  BIANCA: My time and enjoyment. I’d rather enjoy it in a movie form, and I think part of it is the time it takes. And the time to read a book, too. A movie is an hour and a half. And I honestly don’t do movies that often either.  ZACH:  No,  you  don’t.  That’s  true.  So  these  types  of  entertainment media,  you’re  not  interested  in  investing  much  time  in  any  of those. Why is that?  BIANCA: Because there are other things that I’d rather do. ZACH: Such as? BIANCA: Exercise, shop, work, hang out with my friends, talk on the  phone.  Ever since beginning medical school more than a decade ago, Bianca has been heavily  invested  in  her  career,  spending  long  days  and  nights  studying  for comprehensive exams and medical certiﬁcations, working in hospital emer- gency  rooms  while  on  call,  and  now,  writing  and  editing  documents  and attending meetings for her work as a state administrator in the ﬁeld of child psychiatry.  She  has  much  less  leisure  time  than  I  do  in  academia,  and  less leisure time than Vishnu, Shiva, or Tom. Rather than actively concentrating her mind in the way required to follow the plot of a novel or an elaborate videogame, Bianca prefers leisure activities that allow her to take a mental break, like shopping and surﬁng reality TV shows and talk shows.  Despite  her  long-standing  disinterest  in  videogames,  I  was  pleasantly surprised when Bianca admitted that she believed her childhood gaming expe-   5. Fallout 3  133  riences had a substantial effect on her at that time. I asked her to clarify her belief:  ZACH:  Have  you  ever  been  affected  or  inﬂuenced  through  playing  videogames? BIANCA: I think so. ZACH: In what sense? BIANCA: I think like when I played Super Mario Bros., I think it made me think of an underworld. You know how Super Mario Bros. had that underwater world?  ZACH: Yes. BIANCA: It just made me think of life on a different dimension when I  was playing.  ZACH: Is that any different than being affected by watching a movie that makes you think about a fantasy world, or reading a book that makes you think about a fantasy world?  BIANCA: I think somehow it is qualitatively different. The effect that it has on you, ’cause you’re part of the videogame versus the movie you’re once removed. So it does affect you differently.  ZACH: In what sense? It stayed with you longer? BIANCA: No, I wouldn’t say that it stayed with me longer. I wouldn’t  say that.  ZACH: You thought about it more deeply as a result of playing? BIANCA: Yes! Uh-huh.  So, Bianca believed that the interactivity that came from playing Super Mario Bros. allowed her to think more deeply about the themes and subject matter than  she  would  have  from  watching  a  movie  or  reading  a  book  about  the same themes. This is an interesting and important recognition. But even with this  recognition,  it  is  clear  that  Bianca  has  never  really  identiﬁed  with  the videogame agents  like Mario  or avatars  like Zelda’s Link  she’s controlled in the past. If you recall, Vishnu, Shiva, and Tom all referred to their avatars’ exploits  in  the  ﬁrst-person:  I  threw  for  30  touchdowns  in  Madden;  I  was afraid to get near the water; I killed the goblin with my sword, etc. However, Bianca, when describing what she liked about The Legend of Zelda, used the third person to describe Link: “I thought the character, what they were able to do, was exciting at the time in the sense of the places they went.” This shows that Bianca did not identify very closely with the avatar. Bianca seems here to make a clear distinction between herself as the game player and the diegetic avatar; she believes that it is her who must master the gaming controls, but that it is Zelda’s Link who is exploring the gameworld. Bianca has no history of any blurring of her real-world identity and her virtual identities.  Perhaps this is because she has yet to experience any modern roleplay- ing games that truly allow for vast avatar customization. Part of the problem   134  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  might also be Bianca’s disinterest in fantasy or other ﬁctional settings. As I mentioned earlier, Bianca has expressed an interest in car racing videogames, but only the most simulatory ones in arcades that have cockpits with a steer- ing wheel and foot pedals. I asked Bianca why this was currently the only type of videogame she had any interest in:  ZACH: What is it about car racing games? BIANCA: Because I like to drive. I always have. It has always just stim- ulated my mind. Even before I could drive, I liked going fast in cars.  ZACH: So there is an immediate relationship between something you like  to  do  in  the  real  world  and  in  the  videogame?  There  is  a direct correlation?  BIANCA: Yes. ZACH: So, you don’t for example like guns, and so you don’t like games  where you have to shoot people.  BIANCA: Correct. ZACH: You’re saying that you want games that mimic the real world as closely as possible, or you can’t get interested? You aren’t inter- ested in playing games that are about things that you don’t do in the real world or that you can never have the opportunity to do?  BIANCA: Correct. ZACH:  Why  is  that,  do  you  think?  Many  people  play  videogames  to escape. It’s leisure time which is often not about things that peo- ple have to do in the real world. Why do you think you’re the opposite in this regard?  BIANCA: Because I think, why waste time on something that you can’t  really do?  Bianca might be even more literal-minded than Tom. For her, leisure time escape comes from voyeuristically peeking into the lives of pseudo-celebri- ties on reality-TV shows like Keeping up with the Kardashians, The Hills, The Girls  Next  Door and  The  Real  World.  Bianca  also  regularly  watches  the  E! Channel to keep caught up on the latest Hollywood scandals, divorces, and celebrity adoptions. The bizarre lifestyles of celebrities as shown on TV are fantastical enough for Bianca and most of these stories can be absorbed in less than thirty minutes. Who needs Lara Croft or goblins when one has Kim Kardashian  and  Hugh  Hefner?  Not  Bianca;  she’s  content  to  let  her  mind unwind with the trivial absurdities of reality television. Fantastical worlds with complex narratives and sophisticated gaming interfaces require more mental work than Bianca has ever been willing to give to videogames in the past.  There  is  another  important  factor  that  has  kept  Bianca  from  playing videogames for most of the last twenty years: her belief that videogames are   5. Fallout 3  135  the  trivial  pursuits  of  children.  Despite  her  toleration  of  my  own  love  of videogames  and  videogame  scholarship,  deep  down,  Bianca  thinks  adults should grow out of this affection. When I asked her how and why she had begun playing Atari at the age of six or seven, she admitted that she had been inﬂuenced by her brother: he played, she watched him play, and then wanted to play herself. When I asked her if this sibling mimicry was the only reason, she replied, “Partly. Just like, I was a kid. It was something that interested me.”  This  is  a  telling  statement:  Bianca  suggests  that  she  wanted  to  play videogames in part simply because she was a child. And of course, children will like videogames. It’s true, many children do like videogames. But Bianca has set up a binary in her mind: children play videogames, adults do not. I strongly  believe  this  mindset  contributes  heavily  to  Bianca’s  disinterest  in videogames. She revealed this mindset again when, in trying to prepare her to play Fallout 3 for this study, I asked her if she might not enjoy playing as a hero:  ZACH: Most videogames place you as the central character, the protag- onist. You don’t have any interest in being the hero, saving the world?  BIANCA: I don’t believe it. ZACH: What don’t you believe? BIANCA: I don’t believe in a videogame you’re the hero and you’re sav-  ing the world.  ZACH: Why not? BIANCA: Because it is just a videogame.  Perhaps to Bianca, this is true, but try telling that to Shiva, whose real-world fear of water kept Shi out of Vvardenfell’s lakes and rivers. Or to Vishnu, who exhibited such pride at compiling gaudy quarterbacking statistics in Mad- den. Or Tom, who laughed out loud with satisﬁed pleasure the ﬁrst time vir- tual Tom ﬁred an arrow into the hanging bucket. Bianca clearly believes that videogames are not “real” in any sense of the word, tangible or intangible. How would this mindset affect the connections between her real-world and virtual world identities for this project?  Videogame Selection: Fallout 3  Little in Bianca’s brief videogaming history prepared her to experience Fallout 3. As I brieﬂy mentioned at the end of the last chapter, Fallout 3 is not set in a fantasy world with mythical creatures or magical spellcasting as so many v–RPGs are. Instead, the Fallout universe draws inspiration from  a  popular  science  ﬁction  genre:  future  dystopia.  Mel  Gibson’s  Mad  Max ﬁlms, Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner, and C.M. Stirling’s Dies the Fire and its   136  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  sequels in the Emberverse series are among the many popular texts of this genre.1 Typically, future dystopian works depicts a bleak vision of Earth in the future, when much has gone wrong  usually as a result of human greed, ignorance, and or global warfare . The ﬁrst Fallout videogame, released in 1997, envisioned our world ravaged by nuclear war. In this future dystopia diplomatic relations between the United States and China deteriorate, lead- ing in 2077 to nuclear war. Even though the war lasted less than two hours, most  of  humanity  was  obliterated  in  the  maelstrom  of  ﬁre  and  radiation. Most who survived the war did so underground, in community-sized bomb shelters called vaults. Well stocked with provisions and amenities, hundreds of people could live in each vault indeﬁnitely. A generation passed, and still the  vaults  remained  closed  to  the  outside  world.  The  plot  of  Fallout takes place in 2161 in Vault 13  located in southern California . Due to the failure of a computer chip essential to the vault’s water puriﬁcation and recycling system, the gamer’s avatar is sent out from the vault to try to ﬁnd a replace- ment. The plot unfolds from there; the avatar must not only ﬁnd a suitable water chip, but also eventually defeat an army of super mutants led by a mys- terious mutant called “The Master.”  Fallout received  much  critical  accolade,  and  in  1998  Fallout  2 was released. Here, the story takes place in the year 2241, eighty years after Fall- out.  The  gamer’s  avatar  is  a  direct  descendent  of  the  Fallout avatar,  who founded a tribal community named Arroyo in northern California after sav- ing Vault 13. Once again, the gamer’s avatar is charged with saving the com- munity he she has grown up in. This time the avatar must venture into the wastes to ﬁnd a Garden of Eden Creation Kit  GECK , a technological device reputed to be able to turn the radiation-ravaged wasteland back into a green, healthy ecosystem. As with Fallout, Fallout 2’s plot ends up being much more complicated than this simple ﬁnd-and-retrieve mission. Ultimately, the avatar must confront the Enclave, the last corrupted remnants of United States gov- ernment, on an offshore oil rig. To complete the main narrative and end the game, the avatar must free both Arroyo’s villagers and members of Vault 13 from this Enclave base and destroy the oil rig, ending the Enclave’s evil exper- imentations with mutagenic airborne viruses.  Both Fallout and Fallout 2 are much beloved by v–RPG aﬁcionados for the many freedoms they afford the gamer in terms of avatarial creation and development and also gameworld exploration. Male or female avatars were possible, even though technological limitations didn’t allow the faces of the avatars  to  be  customized.  Both  games’  isometric,  third-person  gameworld perspectives,  although  standard  at  the  time,  are  predictably  antiquated  by current  technological  standards.  Nevertheless,  both  games  have  incredibly deep customization options available for avatar creation. Whereas Morrowind   5. Fallout 3  137  Fallout 2’s isometic, third-person POV.  and  Oblivion use  eight  primary  avatar  attributes   Strength,  Intelligence, Willpower,  Agility,  Speed,  Endurance,  Personality,  and  Luck   the  Fallout games created an attribute roleplaying system known by the acronym SPE- CIAL.  In  order,  these  attributes  are  Strength,  Perception,  Endurance, Charisma,  Intelligence,  Agility,  and  Luck.  In  typical  v–RPG  fashion,  the gamer must choose which of these attributes the avatar is initially stronger in and which weaker. These choices affect the avatar’s actions in the game- world. For example, an avatar with a high Intelligence may receive additional conversation options when talking to NPCs. An avatar with a higher Luck score may have a greater chance of scoring a critical strike on an enemy in combat. A higher Endurance score may mean the avatar won’t become poi- soned  when  stung  by  a  radscorpion,  and  so  on.  Do  you  want  to  play  as  a tough,  strong,  simpleton?  How  about  a  charismatic,  slick-talking  physical weakling? Each gamer can use the SPECIAL attribute system to create the type of avatar they want to play, thus increasing their identiﬁcation potential with the avatar.  Once decided upon, SPECIAL attributes are fairly immutable; only in rare circumstances can they be altered during gameplay. To allow avatars to   138  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  continue to develop during the course of the gaming experience, both games offer  eighteen  different  Skills:  learned  abilities  that  can  be  strategically improved when the avatar levels up.2 During initial avatar creation, the user is also allowed to select up to two Traits for their avatar  none need be selected if the gamer so chooses . The Fallout 2 game manual  known as the “Vault- Tec Lab Journal”  describes Traits in the following way: “Traits are charac- teristics that better deﬁne just exactly who your character is. They don’t really ﬁt into a single statistic or location. They all have a good and bad impact on your character. If you want the good side of a Trait, you must take the bad with it”  26 . Sixteen different Traits are possible.3 If the user envisions an avatar that relies on speech and non-violent problem-solving, the descrip- tion of the Good Natured trait might be enticing: “Your combat skills start lower than normal, but your skills in First Aid, Doctor, Speech, and Barter start higher”  27 . If the gamer intends to craft an avatar that relies on her ﬁsts  to  solve  problems,  the  Heavy  Handed  trait  would  be  a  better  choice: “You do more damage in melee- or hand-to-hand combat. And while you have the same chance to cause a critical hit, your critical hits are not as good as the next fellow”  27 . Finally, both Fallout games also allow the user to select Perks every three levels. Perks are similar to Traits but only have pos- itive  effects  on  the  avatar.  A  whopping  seventy-six  Perks  are  available  for selection, ranging from Cult of Personality  all NPCs react positively to the avatar regardless of the avatar’s Karma rating  to Night Vision  reduces the combat penalties for attacks at night or in low-light conditions . So, eight- een Skills, sixteen Traits, and seventy-six Perks are available in addition to the SPECIAL attributes. These options offer users the ability to craft highly personalized and fairly unique avatars. These features, combined with a com- pelling main narrative, interesting locations, and strategic turn-based com- bat, garnered Fallout a place of honor on many critics “Best Videogames of All Time” lists.4  Fans of Fallout and Fallout 2 had to wait a decade for 2008’s Fallout 3. During this time, Black Isle Studios  the developer of the ﬁrst two games  closed  down  and  original  publisher  Interplay  sold  the  Fallout  license  to Bethesda  Softworks,  who  began  working  on  Fallout  3 in  2004.  Of  course, Bethesda Softworks is also responsible for Morrowind and Oblivion, so there was much speculation that Fallout 3 would be designed in a similar manner. Many  fans  of  the  original  two  Fallout  games  worried  that  this  new  design team would lead to Fallout 3 being more an “Oblivion with guns” experience than a true spiritual successor to the earlier games in the series. To a certain extent, those fears had real merit: Fallout 3’s gameplay does closely resemble Oblivion’s in many ways, from the optional ﬁrst or third-person POVs to the lushly rendered and open-ended gameworld exploration. Yet Bethesda Soft-   5. Fallout 3  139  works did an excellent job of blending the Oblivion gaming mechanics that allow for incredible immersion and avatarial identiﬁcation into a world, story, and mood that embody the existing Fallout universe.  As I brieﬂy mentioned at the end of the last chapter, Fallout 3 is set in the same future dystopia as Fallout and Fallout 2. Set thirty-six years after Fallout 2, Fallout 3 shifts the setting from the West coast to the wastelands on America’s East coast, speciﬁcally those of Washington, D.C. This time, the gamer’s avatar is a resident of Vault 101, located near the ruins of the capi- tal  city.  When  the  avatar’s  father  mysteriously  leaves  the  vault,  the  avatar leaves the vault in an attempt to ﬁnd him in the wasteland. From this narra- tive beginning, the avatar is free to explore the vast gameworld, searching for Dad or not as she see ﬁt. The usual suspects of the Fallout universe are pres- ent: encounters with the Enclave, the Brotherhood of Steel, and super mutants all play a role in the game’s central plotline. But in keeping with the open- ended experiences of Morrowind and Oblivion, the avatar need not follow the main narrative, choosing instead to explore leisurely. If the gamer wants to thoroughly explore the entire world map, this is advisable, since completion of the Fallout 3 main narrative will result in the end of the game. While this is in keeping with Fallout and Fallout 2, it marks a departure from Morrowind and Oblivion: both of those Bethesda Softworks v–RPGs allowed the user to keep playing after the completion of the main storyline indeﬁnitely. As with Fallout and Fallout 2, the cinematic that ends Fallout 3 varies depending on the avatar’s previous gameplay actions. Obviously, the town of Megaton can- not be shown to be a thriving community in this cinematic if the avatar had previously destroyed the community with a small nuclear bomb  one distinct possibility . Through the variability in the ending cinematic, the gamer can tangibly trace the consequences of their diegetic actions on Fallout 3’s game- world.  Fallout 3 allows the user to choose either a male or female avatar just as its predecessors did, but also takes advantage of the deep facial customiza- tion options of Oblivion: all the different parts of the face can be manipu- lated, allowing for incredible diversity. When I created my Fallout 3 avatar Zachary,  I  spent  twenty-ﬁve  minutes  on  facial  construction,  making  my avatar’s face and hair as much like my own as possible. How much time would Bianca spend customizing her avatar, I wondered? Fallout 3 also offers the SPECIAL attribute system. Each attribute begins with a base rating of ﬁve  out of a maximum of ten ; the user can choose where to place the ﬁve addi- tional  points  available  at  the  beginning  however  she  wants.  Fallout  3 also offers Skills and Perks but eliminates the Traits available in Fallout and Fall- out 2. The number of Skills has been reduced from eighteen to thirteen5, and the number of Perks from seventy-six to ﬁfty-eight. Despite these reductions,   140  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  the user still has an impressively large number of customization options avail- able. Leveling up in Fallout 3 occurs through the accumulation of experience points: completing different tasks and quests garner the avatar points, and when a certain number of points are accumulated, the avatar levels up and is allowed to improve their Skills and select new Perks. Fallout 3 offers an explorable gamespace larger than its predecessors but slightly smaller than Oblivion’s Cyrodiil. Dozens of locations can be discovered, from a slaver base called Paradise Falls to the thriving Rivet City, located on a wrecked aircraft carrier. Like temporality in Oblivion, Fallout 3 displays chronos as the avatar explores the Wastes in real-time. Kairotic moments are also available as the avatar discovers quests and locations at their own pace in whatever order they choose.  One of the most popular aspects of Fallout and Fallout 2 was the turn- based combat system, which allowed the avatar to target speciﬁc parts of the opposition’s  body.  Depending  on  the  avatar’s  proﬁciency  with  the  weapon they were using and their proximity to the enemy target, each game would display  a  chance-to-successfully-hit  percentage  for  each  enemy  body  part. This allowed for strategic combat depth: successfully crippling the left leg of a radscorpion with a sniper riﬂe shot slowed the rush of its attack, allowing the avatar extra shot opportunities before the radscorpion closed to attack range. A successful shot to the eyes of an enemy could blind them, reducing the likelihood of them being able to hit the avatar with a ﬁst or bullet. As a result of these options, combat in Fallout and Fallout 2 could be incredibly tactical, adding a highly strategic element to the combat. Neither Morrowind nor Oblivion offered turn-based combat, but Bethesda Softworks, heeding the pleadings of rabid Fallout fans, wisely included a turn-based combat option in  Fallout  3.  The  game  does  offer  real-time  combat  like Oblivion in  either ﬁrst  or  third  person  POV,  but  also  allows  the  avatar  to  use  the  Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System, known by the acronym VATS. This turn-based combat option pays tribute to Fallout and Fallout 2 by allowing the avatar to target speciﬁc body parts on the enemy. However, not all combat can be done in  VATS:  each  VATS  attack  costs  a  certain  number  of  Action  Points.  The number of action points available depends on the avatar’s Agility and any rel- evant Skills and Perks. The smaller the weapon, the fewer the Action Points are expended in VATS to use it. When the avatar has used all their available Action Points, they must exit VATS and continue any remaining combat in chronos time. Action Points slowly replenish in real-time as well. As a fan of the turn-based combat in the original Fallout, I was deﬁnitely relieved to see turn-based combat in Fallout 3. It is incredibly satisfying to strategically tar- get a super mutant’s left arm with a shotgun and cripple that limb with a suc- cessful  shot,  preventing  the  mutant  from  using  the  heavy  two-handed   5. Fallout 3  141  sledgehammer it had been carrying. Fallout 3 brilliantly weds the fast-paced combat  of Oblivion with  the  thoughtful  tactical  combat  of  Fallout;  having both  combat  options  available  is  ideal,  and  I  hope  future  v–RPGs  follow Bethesda’s lead.  Fallout  3 is  also  more  simulatory  than Oblivion.  After  all,  this  is  our world, America, the avatar is exploring. Even with the futuristic setting, the ruined  houses  and  communities  of  the  wasteland  are  dotted  with  familiar objects. Teddy bears, wooden blocks and toy cars heartbreakingly indicate what had once been a child’s bedroom. Burned and ruined books are strewn haphazardly on shelves and on ﬂoors. Rusted carcasses of cars and trucks dot the landscape, indicating where roads and highways once were. It’s all very familiar, even though this is clearly a world that has moved on from our own. All  the  best  works  of  future  dystopia  excel  at  creating  this  mixture  of  the familiar and the strange and foreign and Fallout 3 has captured this blend. The game also offers simulatory mini-games. The avatar can attempt to pick locks on containers and doors using a bobby pin and a screwdriver. By rotat- ing the bobby pin and applying pressure with the screwdriver, the user can “feel” how much pressure is being placed on the bobby pin. With too much pressure,  the  bobby  pin  will  snap,  causing  the  avatar  to  begin  the  process again with a new bobby pin. In this way the user’s skill and patience in rotat- ing the bobby pin to ﬁnd the pressure points of the lock can directly impact their success lockpicking. Fallout 3’s world also has many computer termi- nals  all with glowing green CRT monitors  that the avatar can attempt to hack into by correctly guessing the login password from a screen full of poten- tial passwords. Fallout 3’s game manual  entitled the “Vault Dweller’s Sur- vival Guide”  describes the hacking process: “Each incorrect guess will tell you the number of letters that are in the right location for the actual pass- word. Using the process of elimination you should be able to determine what the correct password is before you run out of tries”  35 . The user has four tries to guess the password before the computer locks her out of the system. Both the lockpicking and computer hacking mini-games increase the poten- tial for simulatory immersion in the Fallout 3 gameworld. Whereas Obliv- ion and  Morrowind offered  many  dozens  of  books  ﬁlled  with  Elderscrolls  lore,  Fallout  3 avatars  can  discover  audiolog  tapes  that  can  be  listened  to. Some  of  these  audiologs  provide  insights  into  quests  and  some  of  them recount the last words of people obliterated in the nuclear war of 2077. These audiotapes help to ﬂesh out the gameworld and provide a tangible history  of the radiated land the avatar is exploring. Similarly, several radio broad- casts can be listened to, including an Enclave station and a CNN-like Galaxy News  Radio  station.  Listening  to  these  stations  can  also  provide  insights  into both the history and political climate of the gameworld. So, Fallout 3   142  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  offers an incredibly immersive experience with avatar construction options that have the potential for deep identiﬁcation between the virtual and real- world identities of the user. But would Bianca be able to ﬁnd these connec- tions? Would she be willing to care enough to identify with her avatar in any meaningful way? I turn now to an examination of Bianca’s Fallout 3 gaming experience.  Choosing the Avatar’s Sex and Name  Fallout 3 begins with a cinematic, narrated by Ron Perlman. It recounts the history of the Fallout world, describing the nuclear war, humanity’s retreat into vaults, and the still-sequestered status of Vault 101. Even as other vaults have cautiously opened their doors to allow their denizens to return to the surface now that the lethal doses of radiation have retreated, Vault 101 has remained closed. No one enters, no one leaves. Are Vault 101 citizens kept safe, protected from the horrors of the wastes, or are they prisoners of the outdated traditions of their ancestors? It is into this situation that the gamer’s avatar is born — literally. The game begins with the birth of the avatar, deliv- ered by the avatar’s father  voiced by Liam Neeson . As if speaking to him- self, Dad asks if the new baby is a boy or a girl; a prompt then appears asking the gamer to choose the sex of her avatar. Bianca chose to play as a female avatar. I asked her why: “Because I’m female! I wanted to be the sex that I am, I wanted to represent more who I am.” The ﬁrst avatarial identiﬁcation Bianca  is  able  to  make  demonstrates  merger  with  her  real-world  identity. Next, Dad asks his wife what a good name for the little girl would be. This triggers  the  name  creation  screen;  the  user  is  free  to  input  any  name  they wish. Bianca chose the name “Joojee.” Bianca is second-generation Persian- American;  both  of  her  parents’  ﬁrst  language  is  Farsi.  As  a  result,  Bianca speaks broken Farsi as well as her ﬁrst language English. In Farsi, “joojee” is a  term  of  affection,  usually  given  to  a  beloved  younger  relative   like  one’s own child, a niece, or a cousin . When I asked her to explain why she chose this name for her avatar, Bianca replied, “It’s a term of endearment, and I wanted to see how they would use it in the videogame and also how it would sound in the automated computer feature.” This statement not only reveals that Bianca thought on her infant avatar self with affection  as a “joojee”  but also her vast inexperience with videogames. Bianca thought that NPCs in the game would say the avatar’s name; she clearly expected Dad to say “Joojee.” This  is  a  naïve  assumption:  Fallout  3’s  programmers  cannot  predict  what English names will be given to the avatar, let alone user choices in other lan- guages like Farsi. That Bianca expected to hear her avatar’s name spoken in the gameworld reveals an unrealistic expectation. Nevertheless, it is clear that   5. Fallout 3  143  Bianca is drawing on her real-world identity to make the initial decisions on sex and name for her virtual identity.  Racial, Facial, and Hair Selections  After seeing that Bianca had chosen a name that had personal meaning to her, I expected her to try to make Joojee’s face and hair mimic her real- world  appearance  as  closely  as  possible.  She  didn’t,  even  though  at  ﬁrst  it seemed as if she was going to. Bianca began manipulating the deep facial cus- tomization options, experimenting with how far apart Joojee’s eyes were from each  other  and  how  long  her  nose  sellion  was.  But  after  three  minutes  of playing  around  with  the  individual  components  of  the  facial  construction system, Bianca returned to the initial facial creation screen and selected one of the pre-established facial templates available for a Hispanic woman. I asked her why:  ZACH: You tried to customize the face for awhile, but then you gave up, went back, and let the game randomly assign one. Tell me how you made this decision.  BIANCA: I liked the original face better. When I got into it, there was  so much detail in going into putting  a  face  together.  I didn’t  have  the  patience  to do it. I just wanted to create a  face  fast  and  that’s  why  I went back.  ZACH: And you decided on a face that  you  liked  the  appear- ance of in what way?  BIANCA: I thought she looked cool  and pretty.  If  it  had  been  quick  and  easy  to  do, Bianca likely would have tried to have Joojee  mirror  her  real-world  face. When  it  became  clear  that  accom- plishing this was going to take quite a bit of time, Bianca lost interest, opt- ing instead for the ﬁrst “pretty” face she had seen earlier. Bianca also gave Joojee electric orange hair. I was curi- ous:  why  not  select  one  of  the  pre- established  faces  and  hairstyles  that were more like Bianca’s own?  Bianca’s avatar Joojee, initial creation.   144  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  ZACH: Explain to me why you didn’t select face and hair that were more  BIANCA: Because it is more fun to do a hair style to make you look dif-  representative of how you look.  ferent than you actually look.  ZACH: Then why not make Joojee a man? That would be even more dif-  BIANCA: Because I don’t associate ... it’s not as fun to create a character for a man, there are not as many options for a man as for a woman. ZACH: What do you mean there aren’t as many options? There are exactly the same number of options for a male as for a female in there! BIANCA: But, not all the options look as good on a male as they do on  ferent.  a female.  ZACH:  How  do  you  know?  You  didn’t  go  through  any  of  the  male  BIANCA: Because I’ve seen through Wii games how to create hairstyles  options so how can you say?  and other stuff for men.  ZACH: What Wii games are you talking about? BIANCA: I’m talking about the little stylistic person that you are. ZACH: You’re talking about the mii people?6 BIANCA: Yep! ZACH: So you like the way the women look better in the mii people? BIANCA: Yeah. They are more fun. ZACH: And so you used that to project that you wouldn’t like the way  the male avatar looked in Fallout 3?  BIANCA: Yes.  Even as Bianca seems willing to experiment with Joojee’s appearance, she isn’t willing to roleplay a male avatar. Notice here that she begins her explanation of why a male avatar wasn’t a consideration by saying that she doesn’t “asso- ciate”  with  male  avatars.  Too  much  identiﬁcatory  division,  perhaps?  It  is interesting here that even a non-gamer like Bianca tried to draw on her past videogaming  experiences  to  explain  her  diegetic  choice  here  in  Fallout  3. Bianca had watched me create a personalized mii in Wii Sports; I had also cre- ated a mii avatar for Bianca to try to encourage her to play with me. Appar- ently  she  found  the  hairstyle  options  for  female  mii  avatars  much  more appealing. Vishnu, Shiva, and Tom also drew on past videogaming experi- ences to help inform their gameplay for this study; Vishnu and Shiva did so with much greater success than Tom or Bianca, as these latter two lacked rel- evant v–RPG experience to help accurately prepare them for their Oblivion and Fallout 3 experiences respectively.  How SPECIAL: Attribute Selection  Once  Bianca  made  the  ﬁnal  decisions  about  Joojee’s  appearance  a cutscene ensues: complications from the delivery of Joojee lead to the death   5. Fallout 3  145  of  the  avatar’s  mother.  The  game  then  resumes  after  one  year  has  passed, with the toddler Joojee in her playroom. It is here that the game’s tutorial begins, offering instructions for how to move the avatar around, look around, and interact with and pick up items. The user is instructed to pick up and read the SPECIAL book on the ground. This triggers the Attribute selection process.  How  would  Bianca  decide  which  attributes  to  raise  and  which  to lower, given that she hadn’t read the gaming manual at all and therefore knew nothing  about  how  the  Attributes  would  affect  gameplay?  Each  SPECIAL attribute starts with a base of ﬁve points  out of a maximum of ten ; ﬁve addi- tional  points  can  be  added  to  any  of  the  Attributes  here  at  the  beginning  of  the  game.  After  looking  at  each  of  the  seven  Attributes  brieﬂy,  Bianca decided on the following values: a Strength of seven, a Perception of four, an Endurance of six, a Charisma of ﬁve, an Intelligence of eight, an Agility of ﬁve, and a Luck rating of ﬁve. I asked Bianca why she had privileged Intelli- gence, Strength, and Endurance as her preferred Attributes:  ZACH: Can you tell me about the ones you raised the highest? Why was  BIANCA: The reason why I chose why I did, it was points that I value  Intelligence the highest?  in real life.  ZACH: Intelligence, Strength, physical strength, was the next highest,  and Endurance. So those are the three you value?  BIANCA:  I  think  it’s  a  combination  of  what  I  think  you’ll  need  in  a  videogame to do well versus what I value in real life.  ZACH: Tell me about that combination. Why did you think you’d need  BIANCA: To ﬁgure out the different levels and how to get places, and  ZACH: And Strength? BIANCA: Because usually you have to kill things, and defend yourself  ZACH: You know that how? BIANCA: Because of my past experiences with videogames. ZACH: And then you chose Endurance. Why? That’s kind of a strange  a high intelligence?  what to do next.  in videogames.  choice.  videogame.  BIANCA: I don’t think it is! ZACH: Why not Perception? Or Charisma? Or Agility? Or to be Lucky? BIANCA:  Maybe  because  I  don’t  feel  like  Charisma  is  necessary  in  a  ZACH: Why not? BIANCA: Charisma? ZACH: How is Endurance necessary? BIANCA: Because you want to be able to get through the game! ZACH: I see. But it was hard to fathom how Charisma might be some-  thing you would need to get through the game.   146  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  BIANCA: Yeah. Or even Agility. I guess Agility might come in handy to get through complex courses but I thought Endurance was more important. I felt Endurance trumped Agility.  ZACH: Okay. And your lowest one was Perception. Why that one? BIANCA: I had to give up some. I would have liked to raise all of them  but I couldn’t.  I ﬁnd it interesting here that Bianca the non-gamer admits that she makes her Attribute decisions drawing on both her real-world identity  “the points that I value in real life”  and her beliefs about what her avatar will need to be successful in this virtual world. Bianca views herself both as intelligent and strong and wanted Joojee to have these attributes as well. She was clearly able to convince herself that they would be beneﬁcial within the gameworld as well, even though Bianca’s past videogaming experiences with Super Mario Bros., Pitfall, and The Legend of Zelda didn’t prepare her for attributes like these impacting gameplay at all. I suspect that Bianca made these decisions drawing  almost  exclusively  on  her  perceptions  of  her  real-world  identity’s own skills. I believe during her post-gaming interview she felt obligated to justify these decisions in relationship to the avatar’s needs, even though Bianca was really selecting Attributes she felt she herself embodied. All of the par- ticipants  have  demonstrated  in  some  capacity  or  another  that  some  of  the avatarial identiﬁcations made are unconscious; I’m pretty sure Bianca hadn’t consciously made the connection between her Attribute selections and her views of her own self-identity when selecting her SPECIAL attributes.  This unconscious blurring between real-world and virtual identity was also revealed when the avatar’s Dad entered the playpen room and said hello to  Joojee.  Bianca  responded  with  an  enthusiastic  “Hi,  Daddy!”  However, when I asked her why she had felt compelled to speak to the TV screen, Bianca didn’t at ﬁrst remember that she had spoken out loud:  ZACH: Do you remember that you said “Hi, Daddy!” when your father  was talking to you when you were one-year-old?  BIANCA: Yes, I remember. Wait, I said that myself ? ZACH: Why did you say that? BIANCA: Because that was developmentally appropriate. ZACH: What do you mean? BIANCA: I wanted to see what I could say! Didn’t I say it with my char-  acter? I didn’t say it myself out loud, did I?  ZACH: Yes, you said it out loud. BIANCA: I think he [Dad] said something out loud. ZACH: Yes, he was talking to you. But your avatar doesn’t have language  BIANCA: I thought in the playpen room she does have language. ZACH:  No,  just  gurgling  and  bubbling.  But  you  said,  “Hi,  Daddy!”  yet, just sounds.  Explain that.   5. Fallout 3  147  BIANCA: I don’t know if I can. Um, I was trying to get into character? ZACH: And so you were responding as Joojee? BIANCA: Yes.  It is fascinating that in her mind, Bianca had mistakenly believed that her avatar had responded to Dad, even though it had been her real-world iden- tity  that  had  spoken  the  words  aloud.  This  seems  to  demonstrate  a  clear merger between the real-world and virtual identity in the projective iden- tity:  Bianca  and  Joojee  were  the  same  in  Bianca’s  mind  in  this  moment  of spontaneous verbal response to diegetic Dad. And it was clearly an uncon- scious identiﬁcation, as Bianca initially believed the words had been spoken by the avatar Joojee. How often does liminal space get crossed unconsciously in videogaming moments like this? Even Bianca the non-gamer is suscepti- ble to this blurring of identity.  Diegetic Experimentation and Avatar Ethics  After Bianca made her ﬁnal SPECIAL choices, the game once again moves forward in time: this time to Joojee’s tenth birthday party. This phase of the tutorial  is  designed  to  allow  the  avatar  to  practice  choosing  conversation choices  when  talking  to  NPCs,  moving  around  the  gaming  environment, using the PIP Boy menu and inventory screens, and to get her feet wet in com- bat.  Dad  invites  Joojee  to  spend  time  to  talking  to  the  other  guests  at  the birthday party, who include other ten-year-olds like Amata and Butch along with adults like the Overseer  Amata’s father  and some of Dad’s co-work- ers. When conversing with NPCs, the avatar is usually given at least three dialogue choices: one is respectful, one is neutral, and one is mean, disre- spectful, and rude. Bianca quickly demonstrated in conversations with Amata and Old Lady Palmer a willingness to choose the rudest possible conversa- tion choices. I asked her why:  ZACH:  At  your  tenth  birthday  party,  you  started  to  have  dialogue options: you could talk to Amata, the other little boys, etc. Your ﬁrst  choice,  you  chose  to  be  friendly  to  Amata,  but  then  you quickly chose kind of a mean conversation option, and then you chose  other  mean  conversation  options  too.  Tell  me  how  you made those decisions.  BIANCA: I just was curious to see where that would take you, take me. If I clicked on the nice ones, that seemed a little bit boring, it seemed like I wasn’t getting enough information.  ZACH:  So  you’re  saying  you  thought  you  would  get  more  informa- tion if you were mean as opposed to if you were nice? Explain that.   148  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  BIANCA: First I chose the nice route, and I wasn’t getting the informa-  tion I needed, so I tried the opposite route.  ZACH: And so do you feel like you got the information better by being  mean?  BIANCA: Um, different information. ZACH: That’s true. Did you not have any moral qualms about being rude or mean or impolite? Especially Old Lady Palmer, for heaven’s sake? You were immediately disrespectful to her.  BIANCA: None. It’s a videogame, for god’s sake! It’s not life.  Bianca  clearly  demonstrates  here  that  she  never  considered  Joojee’s  ethics when making diegetic decisions. Why would she? After all, Bianca believes there is nothing “real” about the action taking place in Fallout 3. She was will- ing to say or do anything if she thought it would help Joojee progress through the vault. This was further evidenced by Joojee’s willingness to try to pick- pocket  all  of  the  guests  at  the  birthday  party.  Playing  with  a  Xbox  360 gamepad,  Bianca  had  unwittingly  pushed  in  the  left  thumbstick;  doing  so causes the avatar to crouch down, entering Sneak mode. In this mode, the avatar’s option to converse with NPCs changes to an opportunity to pick- pocket them instead. It was clear that Bianca didn’t even know that the left thumbstick could be depressed as a button; she had accidentally pushed in on  it  when  moving  around  the  party  room.  But  when  the  opportunity  to pickpocket Dad  and Amata, and the Overseer, and the other party guests  presented itself, she never hesitated, gleefully searching each NPC. When I asked why she was so willing to steal from her dad and friends, she replied, “I wanted to see if I could have an advantage. In the videogame, I might need what they have. That’s why.” Once again, there was no connection between Bianca’s real-world ethics and Joojee’s virtual ethics. To conﬁrm this fact, I asked Bianca if she had any ethical qualms about stealing from Joojee’s loved ones. She replied, “Not at all! Not in a videogame. I don’t think there is any direct  correlation  between  my  ethics  in  real  life  and  my  ethics  in  a videogame.” Consciously, Bianca makes a clear distinction between herself and Joojee. Soon enough, Dad instructs Joojee to leave the party and go down to the reactor room, where Jonas has a special birthday present waiting. This present turns out to be a BB gun, scrounged and repaired by Dad and Jonas. This is the avatar’s ﬁrst opportunity to use a weapon, and Dad instructs Joo- jee to practice shooting at the metal targets in the room. Instead, Bianca had Joojee shoot Dad and Jonas in the face with the BB gun several times ﬁrst, giggling  hysterically  all  the  while.  When  I  asked  Bianca  about  this  choice later, she laughed again before giving her explanation:  BIANCA: Here’s the thing. I ﬁgured I might as well amuse myself while  I’m playing since I don’t usually play.   5. Fallout 3  149  ZACH: Why was shooting them with the BB gun more amusing to you than doing what he asked you to do right away  ﬁre at the tar- gets ?  BIANCA: I wanted to see their responses!  Once again, Bianca’s desire to experiment diegetically outweighed any ethi- cal  considerations.  Bianca  didn’t  even  seem  to  consider  the  fact  that  there might be repercussions from shooting her father in the face with a BB gun; what if Dad had taken away the gun as punishment? Then the avatar would have no ranged combat option available. It was clear that Bianca never con- sidered that immoral diegetic actions might have repercussions for Joojee.  The Avatar at Sixteen: Taking the GOAT  Once the avatar demonstrates she can hit the metal BB targets and kill a radroach that appears near them, Dad instructs Jonas to take a picture of Joojee and himself. This triggers the next ﬂash-forward in time: the avatar is now sixteen, the age at which all Vault 101 citizens take the Generalized Occupational Aptitude Test  or GOAT, for short . The GOAT consists of ten questions, each with four answers. In a manner reminiscent of Morrowind’s character generation  the ten questions asked by Socuscius Ergalla in Seyda Neen’s Census and Excise Ofﬁce , how the avatar responds to the GOAT ques- tions will determine which three skills will be tagged. The avatar will begin with a higher rating in these three skills as a result. The GOAT questions are predictably open-ended, with opportunities for the user to choose answers that relate to the different skills available in the game. For example, Ques- tion Seven on the GOAT is as follows: “Oh no! You’ve been exposed to radi- ation, and a mutated hand has grown out of your stomach! Whats the best course of treatment?” The four answers possible are 1  a bullet to the brain, 2  large doses of anti-mutagen agent, 3  prayer, maybe God will spare you in exchange for a life of pious devotion?, and 4  removal of the mutated tis- sue with a precision laser. These responses show an interest in the Small Guns, Medicine, Barter, and Energy Weapons skills, respectively. Once the avatar ﬁnishes the text, the proctor, Mr. Brotch, let’s the user know what skills have been favored. Based on her answers, the game recommended Joojee tag Barter, Explosives, and Medicine. I asked Bianca about the GOAT test and how she felt about these recommended Skills:  ZACH: How did you feel answering those ten GOAT questions? BIANCA: Some of them were funny and others were just, like the ﬁrst  question, I didn’t understand that ﬁrst question.7  ZACH: You chose the technical, gobbledegook answer. BIANCA: Yes. Because I didn’t understand any of the answers.   150  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  ZACH: Do you remember the gist of the other questions? BIANCA: Yes, I do. ZACH: Think about how you answered them. BIANCA: I think I answered them morally correct. How I would answer  questions in my own life.  ZACH: So you are saying you are answering as Bianca would respond rather than any roleplaying that Joojee might be different that Bianca? BIANCA: Yes. And also, the other thing was, when pickpocketing, and all those types of things, those characters wouldn’t necessarily know it, because you were being sneaky, but the results of the GOAT  exam  would  be  available  for  everyone  to  see,  and  that would determine who you would become.  ZACH: Did you know that’s what would happen with the GOAT ahead  of time?  BIANCA: They said that. I knew it was signiﬁcant. ZACH: So you took the GOAT kind of seriously, and answered them as  Bianca would answer them.  BIANCA: Yes. ZACH: And so, he then tells you the results, and basically what that did was tag three of those skills based on how you answered, that you would be proﬁcient in. And those three were Barter, Explo- sives, and Medicine. How did you feel about those three?  BIANCA: Initially I wasn’t sure, but when I looked at the other options  I was happy with the three.  ZACH: Why? BIANCA: It just seemed like my options were just as good as any of the  others.  ZACH: Barter? Is it clear what that means? BIANCA: Yes— be able to trade. ZACH: Explosives? BIANCA: Be able to blow things up. ZACH: How did you feel about that one as something that you would  want to do based on how you had answered?  BIANCA: Good. Because I think it had said if you were going to play a  trick on your dad, I chose to put a cherry bomb in the toilet. ZACH: That sounds like fun, but not too harmful at the same time. BIANCA: Maybe. ZACH: Some of the options  to play a trick on dad  would have been  dangerous to his health.  BIANCA: Yeah. I didn’t want to do any of those. ZACH: And the third one was Medicine. How’d you feel about that one? BIANCA: Good! ZACH: Why so? BIANCA: Because that relates to my real life.  While taking the GOAT, Bianca clearly answered for her real-world iden- tity rather than for Joojee. This was one of the few times when Bianca’s real-   5. Fallout 3  151  world ethics and morals carried over into Fallout 3. I suspect this was because Bianca had no clear plan for how she wanted to roleplay Joojee; she didn’t care about creating a particular type of avatar. As a result, how could Bianca answer  the  GOAT  questions  but  through  her  extra-diegetic  identity?  Cer- tainly, she could have just randomly answered each question without really reading  them  carefully.  Yet  she  didn’t.  She  admits  here  that  she  knew  the GOAT was signiﬁcant to who her avatar was going to become, and perhaps more signiﬁcantly, that all the other vault citizens would know the results  “the results of the GOAT exam would be available for everyone to see, and that would determine who you would become” . Why should Bianca care what the other vault dwellers thought about Joojee? She made it clear that the Fall- out 3 world wasn’t real to her. And yet her response here indicates that some part of her did care about not only who Joojee was, but also who Joojee was perceived  to  be  by  others  in  the  gameworld.  Once  again,  unconscious identiﬁcation seems to be taking place between Bianca and Joojee.  Obstacles to Immersion  After  completing  the  GOAT,  this  tutorial  portion  of  the  game  again moves forward in time another three years. The avatar is now nineteen, and is awoken in her quarters by a panicked Amata. Amata tells the avatar that Dad has left the vault! The Overseer is furious, Jonas has been killed  as he likely aided Dad in his escape from the vault , and the vault’s guards are on their way to arrest the avatar. Amata begs the avatar to ﬂee the vault via a secret hatch connected to the Overseer’s ofﬁce. To survive, the avatar must follow  Amata’s  advice.  This  desperate  ﬂight  through  the  vault  allows  the avatar to really test the skills introduced earlier in the game: combat with radroaches and the vault’s guards ensue, and there are opportunities to pick locks and hack computers. Once the avatar successfully escapes from the hatch  after a tearful goodbye from Amata , she emerges for the ﬁrst time into the fresh air of the Capital Wasteland. At this point, the game announces that the tutorial portion of Fallout 3 has come to an end; the user has one ﬁnal chance here to make changes to their avatar’s name, appearance, attributes, or tagged skills. This is similar to the completion of the Oblivion tutorial. From this  point  forward,  the  avatar  can  wander  anywhere  in  the  Wastes  they  want, looking for Dad or not. From this Vault 101 exit, the ruined skyline of Washington, D.C., can be seen in the distance, with the Washington Mon- ument  and  the  Capitol  Building  clearly  visible.  Likely  some  Fallout  3 gamers  are  immediately  enticed  to  make  their  way  to  these  familiar  land- marks; others may choose to faithfully travel to Megaton, a nearby settle- ment  where  the  game  has  prompted  the  avatar  to  look  for  information    152  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  Fallout 3’s skyline, post Vault 101.  about Dad. It’s up to the user to decide where to go once escaping from Vault 101.  Bianca completed this tutorial section of Fallout 3 after one hour and ﬁfty-four minutes of gameplay. After Joojee emerged from the vault, Bianca spent less than one minute looking at the wasted skyline of D.C. before ask- ing if she could ﬁnally stop playing. During the course of her Fallout 3 gam- ing, she repeatedly made it clear that if not for her agreeing to play for this project, she wouldn’t have played at all. Bianca: the very picture of a non- gamer. When Bianca began playing Fallout 3, I thought it was conceivable that she  might  come  to  enjoy  playing  once  she  got  used  to  it.  This  never  hap- pened: Bianca stressed that her two hours of gameplay felt “like working a full day, like writing a paper” and that she was exhausted by the experience. Several factors contributed to Bianca’s frustrations playing Fallout 3. Among them was the complicated control scheme gaming interface. In fact, Bianca identiﬁed “trying to learn the controls” as her least favorite part of her Fall- out 3 experience:  BIANCA:  I  think  the  most  frustrating  for  me  was  just  the  angle,  and  walking.   5. Fallout 3  153  ZACH: What do you mean by the angle? BIANCA: You could change where you’re looking, up, down, left, right. And then also the direction that you’re pointing. I feel like since I’m not a videogame player, I get more frustrated with that.  ZACH: Did you feel like it got easier, more intuitive, or did you still  struggle as much as the end as at the beginning?  BIANCA: I still struggled. ZACH: A lot of the time I noticed you would be moving sideway, not  facing the direction you were walking.  BIANCA: I was impatient, so I wasn’t pushing the button. I hated try- ing to learn all the controls. And I’m not committed to learning them either. So there is that combination of that they are com- plex, and if I want to learn them, what is the outcome for me? I’m not interested in playing the game.  ZACH: So, no motivation to learn the controls, but you have to be moti-  vated to learn the controls because they are complex.  BIANCA: Yes.  Bianca has articulated why she struggled with the gaming interface here: in order to learn to use the interface well, one has to be interested and moti- vated to do so. As Gee has pointed out in several of his works, learning hap- pens best when the learner is enjoying the process of learning. Bianca hated playing Fallout 3; it drained her energy and didn’t hold her attention. As a result, she had a terrible time paying attention to the on-screen instructions for controlling the avatar, using the Pip-Boy menus, and opening doors. As result, Joojee wandered aimlessly in the bowels of Vault 101 for several min- utes before ﬁnding the stairwell that led to the higher levels of the vault and ultimately freedom.  Nor did Bianca enjoy wandering in Vault 101: she made it perfectly clear that the richly rendered gameworld of Fallout 3 held little interest for her, even the newly-discovered land outside of the vault:  ZACH: When you ﬁnally got outside of Vault 101, you got to look out at  the  wastelands.  Did  you  ﬁnd  any  interest  in  exploring  that gameworld space, this new open territory where you can go any- where? Did you have any interest in exploring it?  BIANCA: I think it was exciting at ﬁrst to see the light of day but when  I looked around it looked depressing, so no.  ZACH: When you were down in the vault, how did you ﬁnd the envi-  ronment, the space you were navigating?  BIANCA: Claustrophobic, depressing. ZACH:  And  so  you  weren’t  interested  in  the  way  the  game  designers  had put this futuristic yet retro vault together?  BIANCA: I liked when the vault opened up, that type of thing. I liked the sound it made. I liked being able to go and do something dif- ferent.   154  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  ZACH: What would be an example of different things that you got to  do?  BIANCA: Like when I opened the vault door and got to go up into a dif-  ferent area. Or when I got to move on to the next level.  ZACH: So it wasn’t about the spaces themselves, it was about moving through the spaces, knowing you were getting one step closer to your goal.  BIANCA: Yes. ZACH: So the gameworld was just space you were moving through to get from A to B without the space being particularly interesting. BIANCA: Yes. Except I thought it was interesting the way they designed  the vault and everything.  ZACH: What do you mean? BIANCA: Like how it opened up, when you put the code in correctly [in the Overseer’s ofﬁce computer] I wasn’t expecting the ﬂoor to open up.  ZACH: Now that you are out in the wastes, how interested would you be in going to try and ﬁnd dad? What would you do in theory?  BIANCA: I would probably just go search for my dad. ZACH: Why? BIANCA: That would be the goal. I would be kind of upset: why didn’t he tell me ahead of time? I would want to know the answer as to why he left.  ZACH: What happens after you ﬁnd him? What would you do? BIANCA: I would ask him why he left. And then hopefully his answer  would help clue me in to what I would do next.  ZACH: That sounds like you would be following the main plotline. BIANCA: Yeah. I’m not interested in other stuff. ZACH: You would want to get through that main storyline, even though there are dozens of other places you can go, people you can talk to. No interest?  BIANCA: No. ZACH: Why? BIANCA: Cause I’m all about getting from point A to point B. ZACH: And that’s in completing the story? BIANCA: Completing the game.  Bianca’s  words  here  reveal  two  key  factors  that  helped  prevent  her  from becoming immersed in Fallout 3. First, the world of the game didn’t interest her; she had no desire to explore in the Capital Wasteland, let along the dif- ferent rooms in Vault 101. The future dystopia presented was too depressing for her. To Bianca, the environment of Fallout 3 existed not to be explored with interest in discovering new locations, but to help her move from “point A  to  point  B.”  Her  statements  here  highlight  another  component  that  no doubt hurt her investment in the game: Bianca had no real interest in Fall- out 3’s main narrative. To be sure, when I asked her to speculate on what she   5. Fallout 3  155  would do next if she kept playing, she said she would try to ﬁnd Dad, to ask him why he had left the vault and hope that Dad would “clue me in to what I would do next.” But Bianca’s willingness here to follow the main storyline of Fallout 3 does not really convey serious interest in the narrative for the sake of the narrative. Rather, she is following this plot for the same reason Tom followed the Oblivion main plotline: the assurance that there would be something to do, some tasks to “complete.” Both Bianca and Tom approached their gameplay with very linear mindsets, and with little interest in or patience for exploring and discovering locations and side quests. Bianca in particular made it clear that she would only continue playing Fallout 3 if she was forced, and that she would try to ﬁnish the game as quickly as possible. She knew that completing the main storyline would accomplish this. Bianca also stressed that  point  of  view  made  no  difference  to  her  level  of  immersion  or identiﬁcation with Joojee. She played the ﬁrst half of her Fallout 3 gameplay in the default ﬁrst-person POV before accidentally ﬁguring out how to switch to third-person POV; she then played the ﬁnal hour in third-person perspec- tive. When I asked her why, she replied that it was simply to make her expe- rience less frustrating:  ZACH: Once you discovered the third-person POV, you seemed to pre-  fer that. Can you tell me why?  BIANCA: Because you could see more of the surroundings. ZACH: And why was that better for you? BIANCA: I was fearful of people coming up from behind me and kick-  ing my butt.  ZACH: You didn’t like the ﬁrst-person POV? BIANCA: I liked it, but when people started attacking me, I preferred being able to see what was around me. I think it was easier for me to navigate too.  Bianca’s POV preferences had nothing to do with her identiﬁcation with Joo- jee at all. She liked both perspectives equally, but found it easier to navigate and see when she was being attacked in third-person POV. Bianca had simi- lar ambivalence about the game’s combat options, saying that while it was easier for her as a beginner to use the VATS system due to its slower pace, she thought that it was more impressive to use the quicker real-time com- bat.  Bianca  believed  this  demonstrated  a  higher  level  of  videogaming  skill  even as the real-time combat frustrated her given her difﬁculties controlling the movement of Joojee and aiming her weapon effectively . She also stressed she would ultimately prefer the real-time combat because it took less time than the VATS combat. Once again, Bianca’s lack of patience for a compo- nent of videogame play that I ﬁnd endlessly fascinating  turn-based tactical combat  hurt her immersion within the diegetic world of Fallout 3.   156  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  Avatar Identiﬁcation?  As you can see, Bianca did not have a pleasurable Fallout 3 experience. Playing for a scant two hours exhausted and frustrated her. When I asked her to sum up her experience playing Fallout 3 for this project, she replied, “I just  think  that  I’ve  been  provided  the  opportunity  to  realize  something  I already knew: I don’t like playing videogames!” A truer statement has never been uttered, to be sure. But did the fact that Bianca disliked her experience necessarily mean that there was no connection between her real-world iden- tity and her virtual identity? Bianca, at least, was adamant in her belief that there was no connection between her and Joojee:  ZACH: Who did you want Joojee to be? BIANCA: I would say I really didn’t care. I just wanted to create a char-  acter so I could get the play going. Just get through it. ZACH: So you didn’t care who Joojee was or what Joojee did. BIANCA: No. ZACH: Why not? BIANCA: Because I’m not invested in this! ZACH: And you don’t see any way you could be invested in an avatar  like this in a videogame?  BIANCA: No! ZACH: Who was Joojee? BIANCA: The person she had to be in order to play this game. ZACH: Which was who? BIANCA: No one particular. ZACH: No one you cared about, no one you were invested in? BIANCA: Not at all!  So, Bianca claims that she made no investment in Joojee at all. I don’t agree. I believe Bianca did invest parts of her real-world self into the creation of Joojee. After all, the name “Joojee” itself has personal and cultural mean- ing to Bianca. And her refusal to select a male avatar also spoke to Bianca’s wish to play an avatar that shared her sex. Remember also Bianca’s confu- sion about whether it had been her or Joojee who had spoken the words “Hi, Daddy!” Bianca also admitted earlier that she had answered the GOAT ques- tions “morally correct, how I would answer the questions in my own life.” No investment? No connections between Bianca and Joojee? I beg to differ. During  Joojee’s  ﬂee  out  of  Vault  101  she  encountered  several  guards  who attack her on sight. The ﬁrst of these, Ofﬁcer Kendall, beat Joojee severely with a police baton. Bianca had no weapon equipped at the time, and strug- gled mightily with real-time combat as a result. While Ofﬁce Kendall was hit- ting Joojee over and over with his night stick, Bianca said, “This is traumatic for me!” Later, I asked her why she felt compelled to say this:   5. Fallout 3  157  BIANCA: I think when you don’t know how to play the game, and you have  someone  coming  after  you  like  that,  it  is  not  very  much fun.  ZACH: But “not much fun” is different word choice than “it’s traumatic  BIANCA: Well, I don’t like getting beat up! ZACH: Well, you weren’t getting beat up. Joojee was getting beat up. BIANCA: Well, I mean, it is your character, and so, you don’t want to  for me.”  be destroyed.  It seems to me that Bianca is identifying with her avatar Joojee more than she is willing to admit here. Note that she also refers to the avatar with the ﬁrst person “I” in this passage. Bianca is experiencing merger identiﬁcation with Joojee, even if identiﬁcation is unconscious.  Why can’t Bianca see that she has indeed invested aspects of her real- world identity into her virtual identity? For the most part, I think it is because Bianca does not want to see these connections, since she has a pre-established binary about what types of experiences are “real” and which are not. This is evidenced by the following statement she made when explaining why she had no ethical qualms about being rude to Old Lady Palmer or killing vault guards when escaping: “I think I am able to separate out what is real and what isn’t. Obviously, I know this videogame isn’t real, so certain things it is fun to con- tinue with the same things I am like, and certain parts it is interesting or fun to  do  something  that  I  wouldn’t  do  in  real  life.”  Bianca  is  convinced  that videogame  experiences  are  not  real.  Therefore,  her  avatar  Joojee  isn’t  real either   even  though  Bianca  admits  here  that  some  of  her  decisions  are  the result  of  “the  same  things  I  am  like”  in  her  non-virtual  identity .  Bianca’s viewpoints here, when compared with the opinions of the other participants in this study, suggest that the gamer’s mindset can greatly inﬂuence how con- scious the gamer is of the identiﬁcations taking place with her diegetic avatar. Hardcore gamers Vishnu and Shiva willfully and consciously identiﬁed with their Morrwowind avatars continually, whereas non-gamer Bianca never con- sciously identiﬁed with Joojee at all. Casual gamer Tom demonstrated a mix of both conscious and unconscious identiﬁcation with virtual Tom. However, regardless of whether or not the identiﬁcation was conscious or unconscious, all four participants demonstrated tangible connections between their real- world identities and their virtual identities via projective identities. But why is this discovery signiﬁcant, and why does it problematize new media termi- nology? In the next and last chapter, I answer these questions and make rec- ommendations for future studies on videogame faces, spaces, and places.   Virtual and Non-Virtual Identities Connections and Terminological Implications  Virtual identities are real and productive interventions into our cultural belief that the unmarked social unit is a single self in a single body.  — Allecquere Roseanne Stone, feminist technology theorist, 1995  The human-technical interface occurring at the personalized computer terminal requires a reassessment of questions of human perception and the  body....  Where  the  real  becomes  highly  unstable  as  a  result  of  the  ability to remake it over and over in a manner both comprehensive and spontaneous, we are compelled to turn our attention away from this real- ity.  — David Holmes, identity & technology theorist, 1997  A video game [avatar] is no more virtual than the images of real movie or pop stars: they too are representations which are carefully managed. — Helen Kennedy, video game theorist, 2004  What does this project reveal about identity construction in video role- playing games? First and foremost, it is complicated, with many factors con- tributing to whether or not users identify consciously or unconsciously with their avatars. Vishnu’s and Shiva’s Morrowind data demonstrates a complex relationship between real-world identity, virtual identity, and projective iden- tity.  Each  participant’s  real-world  identities  heavily  and  consciously inﬂuenced the decisions made for their avatars both during the initial cre- ation of the avatar and throughout their gameplay for this study. Neither of these hardcore gamers saw their avatar as a distinct, separate identity. Instead, Vishnu and Shiva admitted that the predilections of their real-world identi- ties often determined the diegetic choices of their avatars, even as they were aware that Morrowind’s Vvardenfell was decidedly not the “real” world. Casual gamer Tom and non-gamer Bianca were less willing to admit many similar- ities  between  themselves  and  their  avatars.  This  did  not  mean  that  these  connections did not exist, however. Tom and Bianca were simply more close- minded about being willing to acknowledge them. In this study the projec-  6  158   6. Virtual and Non-Virtual Identities  159  tive, liminal identity representing the theoretical space between real-world identity and virtual identity was easily and often traversed by Vishnu and Shiva  and occasionally and unconsciously by Tom and Bianca . At times, all four participants moved from their real-world identities to their virtual iden- tities via the transitionary passage through the projective identity seemingly instantaneously. Shiva’s ethical switching related to stealing  her willingness to loot corpses and take potions and herbs but never a person’s books  is one clear example of this. This near-instantaneous passage is signiﬁcant because it reveals just how closely related the real-world and virtual identities were for the hardcore gamer participants. Both Vishnu and Shiva chose to role- play their avatars in ways that were closely related to their real-world iden- tities. Vishnu’s selection of his avatar’s name and gender reﬂected his penchant for humor; many of his other gameplay decisions were motivated by his desire to learn the limits of the gaming system and ﬁgure out the diegetic rewards for ethical and unethical actions. His cavalier attitudes toward avatar death demonstrated this greater interest in ﬁguring out how to beat the gameworld and gaming system than in truly ego-investing in his avatar Steve! Shiva took her investment in her avatar Shi more seriously, avoiding dangers  such as entering the water  when possible and ﬂeeing when Shi’s life was threatened. Shiva also consistently followed a code of ethics  albeit a slightly different code than she follows with her real-world identities  with Shi, only taking items that  she  needed  to  survive  such  as  food,  potions,  and  weapon  and  armor upgrades.  In  addition  to  these  conscious  identiﬁcations  with  their  avatar, both  Vishnu  and  Shiva  also  made  unconscious  identiﬁcations  with  their avatars as well. Vishnu’s hoarding of books that he never read is one such example.  Until  I  asked  him  about  it  in  the  follow-up  interview,  he  wasn’t aware that he was even doing this book collecting. Tom and Bianca also made unconscious diegetic decisions that connected their real-world and virtual identities.  Bianca’s  spontaneous  “Hi,  Daddy!”  and  Tom’s  belief  that  he couldn’t take items from bazaar chests in the streets of the Market District reﬂect these unconscious identiﬁcations. To a certain degree, each partici- pant’s real-world personalities and identities were continually present in the diegetic decisions made by their avatars  whether the users were conscious of their presence or not . These connections allowed for easy identiﬁcation between the users and their avatars as the avatars were continually imbued with the real-world identities’ characteristics, values, and preferences.  Kennedy  argues  that  this  identiﬁcation  common  in  v–RPGs  actually blurs the distinction between user and avatar: “Interaction with and immer- sion in the game affords users the narcissistic satisfaction of relating to a tech- nological second self. [The avatar becomes] an extension of the player and the separateness of the avatar’s body is obliterated”  6 . Kennedy’s argument   160  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  here seems to ring true for the participants in this study. Both Vishnu and Shiva viewed their avatars as extensions of themselves. Each described the actions of their avatars in the ﬁrst-person “I.” Tom did as well. All four par- ticipants  also  gave  their  avatars  names  that  were  meaningful  to  their  real- world  identities.  Indeed,  most  of  Vishnu’s  and  Shiva’s  avataristic  choices reﬂected the desires and interests of their real-world identities  described in greater detail in chapter four . This was less true for Tom and Bianca, but even these less enthusiastic gamers still imbued their avatars with traits that reﬂected their extra-diegetic interests.  This notion of users and their avatars as being separate-yet-the-same is crucial to the signiﬁcance of this study to identity and videogame theory. As noted in chapter two, Fuss accurately reﬂects the complicated nature of iden- tity:  “Identity  has  multiple  and  sometimes  contradictory  meanings.  A  full awareness of the complicated processes of identity formation, both psychi- cal and social, [is needed].... Fictions of identity are no less powerful for being ﬁctions”  98–99 . The identity of a Morrowind, Oblivion, or Fallout 3 user’s avatar is certainly in many ways a ﬁction: it is constructed in a virtual fan- tasy world that is external to the physical body and the pre-established social world of the user. But I believe Fuss is accurate in pointing out that ﬁctional identities are potentially no less powerful psychically than non-ﬁctional ones  socially  as  well  as  in  gaming  worlds .  Certainly,  the  experiences  of  Dante Nerevar, Bloom, and the other Morrowind enthusiasts I met on Elderscrolls. com   discussed  in  chapter  one   show  that  these  users  identify  powerfully with their avatars. Both Vishnu and Shiva seem to as well  Tom and Bianca much  less  so .  However,  my  analysis  of  all  four  participants’  data  for  this project supports both Kennedy’s and Fuss’ views on identity: even as the par- ticipants’  “separateness”  from  their  avatars  disappeared  for  some  diegetic decisions,  at  other  times  the  distinctions  between  real-world  and  virtual- world identities were clearly demarcated. However, exactly when these dis- tinctions  might  occur  was  unpredictable  and or  unconscious,  as  Shiva’s willingness to kill and loot corpses but not steal books exempliﬁes. The con- nections between the participants’ identities  real-world, virtual, and projec- tive   while  playing  these  v–RPGs  were  indeed  multiple  and  contradictory. This multiplicity of Vishnu’s, Shiva’s, Tom’s, and Bianca’s identities and the blurring that took place between them while gaming leads me to the follow- ing question, one with larger implications for identity and videogame stud- ies: are virtual identities necessarily any less “real” than non-virtual identities to the users who create and maintain them?  Obviously  this  is  a  difﬁcult  question  to  answer.  Yet  all  participants demonstrated in this study that at times their avatarial identities were deeply intertwined with their real-world identities and interests. The avatars’ iden-   6. Virtual and Non-Virtual Identities  161  tities were also inﬂuenced and shaped by the videogame world and the game’s programming; users don’t have complete freedom to shape the virtual iden- tity. Yet these diegetic constraints provide a type of social identity construc- tion.  Our  real-world  identities  are  also  molded  by  social  pressures  and limitations: we live in a world not entirely of our own creation, bending to laws and ethical conventions that were discursively established long before we ever entered the conversation. So too are our virtual identities bound by discursive conventions. Bethesda Softworks’ programmers and designers have created a world, a system, which users must learn in order to be successful within that world. All participants in this study admitted that learning  or not being able to learn  these systemic rules played a large role in their immer- sion in and identiﬁcation with the games’ virtual worlds  Vishnu in partic- ular . Is this really all that different from the creation and evolution of our non-virtual identities in our non-virtual world? No. Both virtual and non- virtual identities are discursive in nature.  The data collected from Vishnu, Shiva, Tom, and Bianca demonstrates that all four users brought not only their extra-diegetic identities into this project with them  Shiva’s inability to play a cruel, unethical character and the tongue-in-cheek name of Vishnu’s avatar come to mind  but also that these users brought their past experiences within other v–RPGs with them as well. Both Vishnu and Shiva justiﬁed their diegetic decisions to loot corpses in Morrowind by saying that it was both ethical and expected behavior despite no direct evidence to support these claims within the gameworld. Both par- ticipants cited their past experiences within the genre of video role-playing games, arguing that through these earlier experiences they learned that this behavior was essential to having success in these types of virtual worlds. Both participants were able to apply their earlier virtual experiences to their Mor- rowind gameplay. Tom rested in the Merchants Inn because resting had been crucial to his success in Alternate Reality. Bianca chose a high Strength score because she expected to have to kill other creatures in Fallout 3 and thought being stronger would make this easier. All of these decisions demonstrate that virtual identities and experiences can be transported outside of the virtual space they were created in and can inﬂuence a person’s future behaviors as well. Certainly, once a user quits a gaming session, these virtual experiences may fade into the background of the user’s mind as other aspects of their iden- tities come forward. But does this make these virtual identities and experi- ences any less “real”? Do my non-virtual experiences become “unreal” when I leave them behind? No, just as the non-virtual aspects of Shiva’s identity do not cease to exist when Shi is exploring Vvardenfell but rather inform the decisions made there. These memories of past virtual experiences are thus part of both the user’s virtual identities and their real-world identities.   162  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  Fuss’ notion of identity as multiple and protean, complicated by a cease- less combination of psychic and social factors, is a typically postmodern one. Data collected from Vishnu and Shiva  and Tom and Bianca to a lesser extent  for this project shows that the virtual identities created and maintained by these participants  via a delicious blend of psychic and social variables  can be as “real” as the real-world identities of some users. That is, they are con- structed purposefully in ways that are meaningful to their creators and have the ability to inﬂuence their creators’ future interactions with and reﬂections on external stimuli  whether these stimuli be virtual or non-virtual . It seems clear that the term “real-world identity” used by Gee is problematic: the word “real” sets up a binary with the term “virtual” implying that virtual identi- ties are not and cannot be real. Using these terms, projective identity must then be a bridge between reality and unreality. Gee’s discussion of multiple identities in What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Liter- acy clearly demonstrates that he does not consider his virtual identity Bead Bead in Arcanum nor the projective identity  James Gee as Bead Bead  that aids in Bead Bead’s creation to be “unreal” at all. Why then has Gee chosen identity terminology that seems to misrepresent the very relationships he is explicating?  In 1989, Dr. Marvin Minsky wrote the following words when theoreti- cal awareness of and interest in virtual worlds and virtual identity was in their infancy: “Our connection to the real world is very thin, and our connection with the artiﬁcial world is going to be more intimate and satisfying than any- thing that’s come before”  161 . At that time, too little was understood about the impact of virtual identity construction in virtual game spaces— indeed, too little is understood about virtual identities now. Minsky was likely not the ﬁrst person to separate virtual and non-virtual spaces and identities but his inﬂuential words certainly helped create a terminological binary, a lim- iting binary, that can be traced through the writings of video game and iden- tity theorists to this day.  Real-World and Virtual: A Problematic Terminological Binary  Murray   perhaps  inadvertently   demonstrated  just  how  problematic using  the  terms  “real”  and  “virtual”  as  opposites  was  in  Hamlet  on  the Holodeck when she provided her own deﬁnition for the word “liminal.” Lim- inal, she says, refers to “the threshold between the world we think of as exter- nal and real and the thoughts in our mind that we take for fantasies. When we are in a threshold state [we are] ﬁlled with real sensations and emotions for imaginary objects”  292 . It is interesting to note that Murray here uses the  word  “real”  to  refer  alternately  to  external  stimuli   real-world   and  to   6. Virtual and Non-Virtual Identities  163  imaginary  stimuli.  If  both  types  of  stimuli  are  “real”  and  it  is  the  human mind processing and reﬂecting on stimuli that makes them real for that indi- vidual’s identities, and if a fantasy identity  such as a Morrowind avatar  trig- gers real emotions and sensations, then the binary “real” vs. “virtual” that sets up fantasy identities as “not-real” is inaccurate and in need of adjust- ment.  However, once terminology is established, it is often used without being challenged. The antagonistic pairing of “real” and “virtual” is found through- out  video  game  theory.  In  attempting  to  explain  the  concept  “cyberbeing”  essentially another way to describe liminal space and projective identity , Nicholls and Ryan deﬁne it as “an indeterminate space that hovers between the  actual  and  the  virtual,  the  real  and  the  imagined”   1,4 .  In  describing identity construction in v–RPGs, Filiciak says “[Avatars provide] an oppor- tunity to painlessly manipulate our identity, to create situations that we could never experience in the real world”  90 . These two statements, written in 2005 and 2003, respectively, show the ﬁeld’s willingness to uncritically accept the term “real” even as scholars continually recognize the enduring impact of virtual experiences. Nicholls, Ryan, and Filiciak all use the word “real” in opposition to virtuality while at the same time admitting that the experiences that happen in virtual space may be signiﬁcant to identity formation. Bolter and Grusin acknowledge the non-virtual impact of video role-playing games in Remediation, describing the thoughts and emotions experienced in these spaces  as  “authentic”:  “[Role-playing  games]  provide  a  new  and  authentic experience while at the same time divorcing us from the physical world. If virtual realities can evoke emotions, how can our culture deny that the expe- rience is authentic? Like other media, virtual reality can provide its own, self- authenticating experience”  103, 165 . “Authentic” means something that is substantially true, something that is real. I believe the data collected from the participants for this project make it is clear that “real” experiences impact the identity formations that can take place in virtual settings. Therefore, I rec- ommend that it is time to eliminate usage of the term “real-world” to describe identiﬁcatory experiences that take place outside of virtual spaces. The term “non-virtual” is more accurate and sets up a more appropriate contrast to “virtual.”  This  substitution  would  create  a  continuum  that  focuses  on  the technological and physical differences between virtual and non-virtual iden- tities and experiences rather than on the authenticity or “realness” of those experiences. I believe other videogame scholars would ﬁnd this term more accurate.  Indeed,  Gee  himself  acknowledged  the  problems  with  the  term “real-world” in a question-and-answer session following his keynote address on  videogames  and  literacy  at  an  academic  symposium  in  February  2006. When questioned about his usage of the terminology real-world identity, vir-   164  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  tual identity, and projective identity in What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy, he admitted that real-world identity was “a lousy choice” terminologically because of his belief that the experiences and emo- tions felt in video games were in fact quite real. Gee is willing to acknowl- edge  the  inaccuracy  of  a  term  he  himself  featured  prominently  in  his important treatise on videogames and literacy; it is time “real-world” is elim- inated from videogame and identity scholarship and replaced with the more accurate and less problematic term “non-virtual.” With this new termino- logical continuum perhaps Vishnu wouldn’t be as quick to sheepishly dis- count his sense of accomplishment compiling gaudy statistics quarterbacking in Madden as discussed in chapter three. Instead of using terminology that forces him to consider these accomplishments as “not-real,” he could instead take satisfaction in relating how his projective identity in Madden excelled at ﬁguring out and learning how to beat the gaming system.  There  also  remains  confusion  within  videogame  studies  about  how exactly to characterize the experiences taking place within the virtual worlds of videogames. Like reading books and watching movies, videogames have the capacity to trigger real human emotions as this study demonstrates. Yet the much greater levels of interaction and user freedom to choose their course of action make videogames unique from these other entertainment media. The  following  statement  from  leading  videogame  theorist  Berger  demon- strates not only problematic usage of the word “real” but also this difﬁculty in  characterization  as  he  speculates  on  the  effects  of  videogaming  experi- ences: “What is difﬁcult to know is how being immersed into such a real-life simulation will affect players.... Will video games become a kind of opiate for people  who  can  ﬁnd  an  outlet  in  simulations  that  seem  better  than  those offered  by  their  real-life  experiences?”   107–108 .  Berger  refers  to  all videogames as “simulations” here. Yet this blanket statement does not effec- tively cover all the different genres of videogames. Certainly, many genres of videogames do not seek to faithfully represent the non-virtual world. In chap- ter two I discussed the differences between simulations and simulacra. Sim- ulations seek to be as realistic and as true-to-life as possible whether or not the simulation is recreating the experience of ﬂying an airplane or trying to recreate the battle for Stalingrad. They try to copy the original experience as much as possible. Simulacra on the other hand are copies without any orig- inal   Baudrillard .  How  should  we  characterize  v–RPGs  like  Morrowind, Oblivion, and Fallout 3? Rilstone states that when playing role-playing games “we are creating a ﬁction, not a simulation: dealing not with reality but with the impression of ﬁctional reality. What type of reality we are talking about is  a  matter  of  taste,  of  artistic  temperament.  Whatever  it  is,  we  should  be allowed to become engrossed in it: to accept it as real, to want to spend some   6. Virtual and Non-Virtual Identities  165  time there”  Mackay 28 . Rilstone is right to suggest that v–RPGs are simu- lacra rather than simulations  or at least are much closer to the simulacra end of the continuum than the simulation end .  Morrowind represents this distinction well, as the box that contains Mor- rowind on CD-ROM also contains a glossy map of Vvardenfell, containing topographical information  mountains, rivers  and also marking locations of towns, cities, and other points of interest  ruins, shrines, strongholds . It may seem strange to novice videogame users that Morrowind supplies a non- virtual map for a terrain that only exists virtually. However, the mental exer- cise of creating simulacra is not as uncommon or as difﬁcult as one might think. For example, I have never been to Iceland. I know where it is, geo- graphically, I have viewed its location on a globe, and I have seen a few snap- shots taken there, but that is the extent of my knowledge about Iceland. What happens when I view a topographical map of Iceland? I can look at a map of the country and “read” it based on my past exposure to geographical maps. Based  on  my  past  experiences  with  maps,  my  travels  in  other  parts  of  the world, and my limited knowledge about Iceland, I can  and do  create men- tal  images  and  impressions  about  Iceland  that  may  or  may  not  accurately reﬂect the physicality of the country. Unless I visit Iceland and create new impressions, my pre-constructed images of Iceland generated from looking at a map are “real” for me; they are all I have, and they inﬂuence the way I think and feel about Iceland. We create virtual mental representations every time we look at a map of a place we haven’t physically traveled to and in, drawing on past experiences, things we’ve heard, images we might have seen, and other places we’ve been. In the Baudrillardian sense, mental imaginings of these places may very well be simulacra. I might have created a version of Iceland  in  my  head  that  in  quite  unlike  the  physical  non-virtual  Iceland, which exists at a particular longitude and latitude on planet Earth. My men- tal representation of Iceland may be a copy that does not accurately model the original non-virtual Iceland at all. I may have created a mental copy of a  place  that  doesn’t  exist  in  the  form  I  have  created.  Similarly,  if  a  gamer chooses to view the Morrowind map before they begin playing, they begin to imagine what the land is like. Playing the game itself may prove or disprove these imaginings, just as visiting Iceland may prove or disprove my pre-estab- lished notions of the island nation. Of course Iceland exists non-virtually; Vvardenfell does not. Visiting Iceland would create new mental impressions of the country replacing the potentially simulacra-ish pre-existing thoughts and images. In virtual worlds like Vvardenfell and Cyrodiil, users know that the world exists nowhere else. Traversing the gameworld provides continual reminders of this fact. Sentient aliens continually speak to the avatar  who in both Shiva’s and Vishnu’s case was alien herself  . Strange and fantastical   166  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  ﬂora and fauna dot the landscape. Magical clothing, items, and spells allow for actions impossible in the non-virtual world. Morrowind is clearly not a simulation of any non-virtual space.  Verisimulacratude  How is it then that users like Vishnu, Shiva, Dante Nerevar, and Bloom become so immersed in video role-playing games and the avatars they con- trol there? What would be the best way to characterize this phenomenon ter- minologically?  A  new  terminological  continuum  is  needed.  Simulations immerse users by recreating the non-virtual world and experience as faith- fully  as  possible:  verisimilitude.  The  Oxford  English  Dictionary deﬁnes verisimilitude as the appearance of being real, with as much likeness to real- ity as possible; literally as “true to the substance” of the original as possible. The verisimilitude of simulations is an essential component of simulations’ immersive appeal for many users. Yet v–RPGs like Morrowind and Oblivion offer a different immersive experience because of the many opportunities for identiﬁcation  with  the  avatar  and  the  gameworld.  Users  like  Vishnu  and Bloom spend many dozens of hours within Morrowind immersed in a world that only exists virtually. This world is decidedly unlike the non-virtual world in many ways: casting Fire Bite spells from one’s ﬁngertips, riding within the hollowed-out  exoskeletons  of  giant  insects   silt  striders ,  and  levitating through Velothian wizard towers are actions that have no non-virtual world equivalents.  How  then  does  a  simulacra  v–RPG  become  immersive  for  so many users?  The statement made by Vishnu I provided at the beginning of chapter three  provides  a  clue:  “[Morrowind is]  realistic  enough  that  you  know  it’s almost like your world only better. Only cooler, you know?” Vishnu astutely points  out  that Morrowind’s  Vvardenfell  has  many  properties  that  are  like non-virtual spaces. These similarities are essential because without some kind of connection to the non-virtual people would not be able to identify at all. Thus, the gameworld mimics many of the spatial properties of the non-vir- tual world: gravity, a geographical land mass with urban centers and diverse rural terrain, and opportunities to interact both with other sentients  Mor- rowind’s many NPCs  and with lower life forms  plants and animals . In this way Morrowind is “realistic enough”  to use Vishnu’s words  that users can identify  with  the  physics  and  design  of  the  world  fairly  easily   since  these physical laws mirror the non-virtual world’s properties . These game design elements are simulatory and aid identiﬁcation. Morrowind’s many fantasti- cal elements like magic, sentient alien races, and monsters also contribute to identiﬁcation  as  the  user  encounters  all  of  these  through  the  avatar.  This   6. Virtual and Non-Virtual Identities  167  identiﬁcation does not happen through verisimilitude but rather through the user’s  familiarity  with  and  interest  in  the  generic  conventions  the  v–RPG draws inspiration from. I discussed in chapter two how Morrowind borrows from  the  established  generic  canons  of  fantasy,  role-playing  games,  and videogames. Videogame users like Vishnu and Shiva with a high level of lit- eracy within the v–RPG genre are likely aware of these conventions and expect them to be present in some form. Certainly Shiva and Vishnu demonstrated that  they  relied  on  their  past  experiences  with  other  v–RPGs  to  aid  their understanding of Morrowind’s world. This in turn allowed both participants to be invested in their avatars and immersed in the gaming world. Tom and Bianca  also  tried  to  draw  on  their  past  videogaming  experiences  but  with much less success, as neither of them had exposure to modern v–RPGs prior to this study.  V–RPGs like Morrowind and Oblivion strive to be “realistic” and immer- sive in their depiction of a world that exists nowhere else but in virtual space. This world must follow certain established conventions of the genres it draws inspiration from and from the non-virtual world while at the same time being enough unlike other worlds  both virtual and non-virtual  to feel original. Identiﬁcation in a v–RPG is in this way similar to Gee’s tripartite concept of identity: identiﬁcatory immersion depends on a “delicious blend” of non-vir- tual,  virtual,  and  projective  aspects.  Analysis  of  the  data  collected  for  this study reveals that the term verisimilitude does not accurately characterize the phenomenon by which many video role-playing games offer immersion and identiﬁcation. I do not believe an adequate term yet exists in videogame the- ory to describe this phenomenon and I therefore propose a new term of my own: verisimulacratude. Rather than being true to the substance of a non- virtual experience, place, or object  verisimilitude , verisimulacratude describes the process by which a v–RPG like Morrowind strives to be true to what video- gamers have come to expect from the simulacra they play. If a v–RPG follows established generic conventions yet also feels fresh and original, then liter- ate  v–RPG  users  have  a  greater  chance  of  identifying  with  and  becoming immersed within the role-playing world. Of course, there are many variables in play here: the gaming interface, the main narrative, the combat system, the appearance and customization of the avatar, and the appeal and diversity of the gameworld all impact individual users’ identiﬁcation and immersion. I  offer  the  term  “verisimulacratude”  as  a  way  to  describe  the  general  phe- nomenon  and  process  of  becoming  immersed  in  a  v–RPG  and  avatarial identiﬁcation within those virtual settings. I believe verisimulacratude, when paired with verisimilitude, creates the terminological range of a continuum that would enable videogame scholars to more accurately articulate, catego- rize, and investigate the phenomenon of identity construction in videogames.   168  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  Scope, Time, and Data: My Study’s Limitations  I acknowledge a few signiﬁcant limitations in this study on video role- playing  games  and  identity  construction.  The  ﬁrst  is  the  small  number  of participants.  The  experiences  of  four  participants  are  a  very  limited  sam- pling;  many  more  user  experiences  need  to  be  studied  to  ascertain  more deﬁnitively how identity is constructed through user interactions with video role-playing games. Four participants may seem like an insigniﬁcant num- ber  to  fully  understand  a  complex  phenomenon  like  videogame  identity  construction  given  the  many  variables  that  may  impact  its  formation.  Vishnu and Shiva both relied heavily on their non-virtual identities to cre- ate  Steve!  and  Shi,  respectively.  Yet  their  motivations  and  decisions  were  quite different, just as the levels of investment in their avatars were quite dif- ferent.  Shiva  seemed  to  exhibit  greater  identiﬁcation  with  her  avatar,  yet Vishnu ultimately seemed more immersed in his Morrowind experience, log- ging more than twice as many hours in the gameworld than Shiva did after this  study.  Tom  and  Bianca  also  displayed  complex  and  nuanced  identi- ﬁcations with their avatars with these identiﬁcations often happening uncon- sciously. Tom played Oblivion for six hours for this study; Bianca played Fall- out 3 for only two hours before quitting in frustration. Studying additional users in each of these v–RPGs would obviously provide more data to help analyze the connections between avataristic identiﬁcation and immersion in greater detail.  A second and related limitation of this study was the number of game- play  hours  recorded  and  analyzed  for  each  participant.  Ten  hours  of videogame play is indeed enough time to “ﬁnish” games in some videogame genres such as adventure games and ﬁrst-person shooters. Yet in an open- ended  role-playing  game  like  Morrowind,  this  actually  constitutes  a  fairly small of time. Most v–RPG users spend dozens of hours exploring the vir- tual  world,  leveling  up  their  avatars,  and  completing  the  large  number  of errands and missions that can be undertaken. Vishnu estimated that he played between 100 and 120 hours of Morrowind; Shiva estimated that she played the game for approximately 50 hours. Neither participant came close to ﬁnish- ing the game’s main narrative during that time. Of course, Tom only played Oblivion for six hours for this study. Even though he said he was interested in the game, he has not played a single hour of Oblivion since his participa- tion in this project ended. Bianca only played two hours of Fallout 3 and will never play it again. In contrast, I estimate that I personally have spent over two hundred hours playing Morrowind, over one hundred playing Oblivion, and  sixty  hours  so  far  playing  Fallout  3  I  will  easily  double  this  amount before I leave the Capital Wastes . It seems likely that the longer the amount   6. Virtual and Non-Virtual Identities  169  of time one spends in the gameworld of a vast v–RPG the greater the poten- tial for identiﬁcation with the avatar would be just as the potential for immer- sion within the gaming world would increase with increased exposure in that world. The few hours recorded from each participant in this study represent a small sampling of at least Vishnu’s and Shiva’s overall Morrowind experi- ence. In the recorded ten hours, Steve! only leveled up three times; Shi twice. Each leveling up process allows the user to make choices about strengthen- ing the avatar, which aid in identiﬁcation. Morrowind and Oblivion offer users the opportunity to level up their avatar dozens of times. Fallout 3 avatars can level up twenty times. There are hundreds of other gameplay decisions pos- sible in the quests and sub-quests within these games as well. The choices made by the participants in each of these situations would provide valuable data on the connections between the users’ virtual and non-virtual identi- ties. Too few of these quests are revealed in the recorded hours of gaming for this project. This is evidenced by the illustration below which displays the amount of Vvardenfell explored by Vishnu and Shiva during their gameplay for this project. As you can see, it is a small amount of the available terrain. Recording a participant’s entire gameplay experience within a v–RPG would be  ideal  to  fully  understand  what  identiﬁcations  take  place.  However,  the time-consuming  nature  of  the  data  recording  and  gameplay  transcription make  this  a  difﬁcult endeavor.  In  v–RPGs users  make  decisions continually  and  often unconsciously   “Hi, Daddy!” — or  at  least they aren’t consciously articulating  their avatarial  decisions  to themselves  as  they  are playing.  Their  ratio- nales for diegetic deci- sions may quickly fade from  memory.  For  a study that analyzes the diegetic  decisions  of users,  a  think-aloud protocol  that  records the user’s extra-diegetic rationale  their diegetic decisions in the  Morrowind locations visited by Vishnu and Shiva.  for    170  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  exact moment those decisions were made would be helpful. Yet the thought of a researcher needing to be present for potentially one hundred to one hun- dred and ﬁfty hours of gameplay, audio recorder and notebook in hand is daunting. But how else might we be able to fully understand all of the con- scious and unconscious avatarial identiﬁcations taking place?  Recommendations for Future Studies  Despite  these  limitations  this  study  creates  a  greater  understanding  of  what  form  future  videogame  studies  might  take.  More  comprehensive studies of identity formation in video role-playing games are needed. Due  to the heavy temporal and logistical demands of data collection, compres- sion, and analysis, these studies might best be undertaken by scholars work- ing  in  pairs  or  in  groups.  Studies  with  as  many  participants  and  as  many recorded  hours  of  gameplay  as  possible  would  provide  the  most  compre- hensive  data  on  avatarial  identity  construction.  As  mentioned  previously,  to  record  all  the Morrowind gameplay  for  one  participant,  transcribe  the  data,  analyze  it,  and  interview  the  participant  would  require  hundreds  of hours of scholarly work — yet these are the types of studies needed if we hope to better understand the connections between virtual and non-virtual iden- tities.  The v–RPG data I collected from this study’s participants reveals addi- tional avenues for research and analysis. In this project I have not explored how gender  of both the user and of the avatar  impacted diegetic decisions and identity formation; two male and two female participants are too few to draw  substantial  conclusions  about  the  impacts  of  gender.  Yet  statements from all participants suggest that gender might have played a signiﬁcant role in the creation of their virtual identities. Shiva’s strong desire to select a female avatar  and  her  rejection  of  the  Nord  facial  options  as  not  being  “pretty enough”  hint  at  the  inﬂuences  of  Shiva’s  gendered  identity.  Bianca  also selected an avatar she considered “pretty.” Vishnu’s desire to employ strong- armed  Persuasion  tactics  and  to  problem-solve  violently  may  reveal  the inﬂuences of a masculine gendered identity. Additional studies with larger numbers of participants that focus directly on the inﬂuences of gender on virtual identity formation are needed to explore the connections between the gendered  aspects  of  non-virtual  identities  and  diegetic  decisions  made  for avatars.  The work done for this project also suggests that videogame literacy plays an important role in identiﬁcatory immersion. Both Vishnu and Shiva began their  Morrowind experiences  with  high  levels  of  videogame  literacy  honed over many years of playing videogames. Having played other v–RPGs in the   6. Virtual and Non-Virtual Identities  171  past both participants learned how to manipulate Morrowind’s gaming inter- face  quickly:  Vishnu  only  needed  to  adjust  the  Y-axis  and  Shiva  made  no changes to the control interface at all. Having read the gaming manual before beginning to play, both participants were also well prepared for Morrowind’s diegetic space. Each participant entered the avatar inventory screens many times over the course of their recorded gameplay for a variety of reasons: to examine items the avatar was carrying, to examine the local and world maps, to examine the avatar’s attributes and skills, and to equip spells. The length of  time  spent  in  the  inventory  screen  varied  greatly,  from  several  minutes  examining all the items in a full inventory  to less than one second  check- ing the avatar’s geographical location on the local map . Did the participants’ visits to the inventory screens aid or hinder their identiﬁcatory immersion within Morrowind? What role did the participants’ high levels of videogame literacy play in their diegetic immersion? In contrast, Tom and Bianca both struggled mightily with the complex control pads and diegetic inventories of Oblivion and Fallout 3. How much did these struggles impact these partici- pants’  enjoyment  and  immersion?  Answers  to  these  questions  need  to  be explored to help us understand the connections between technological liter- acy,  diegetic  learning,  and  immersion.  The  videogame  transcriptions  pro- duced  for  this  study   appendix   help  to  highlight  the  types  of  diegetic decisions that might be analyzed to ascertain how videogame literacy impacts virtual identity construction and immersion. This study demonstrates how diegetic data might be effectively collected for videogame literacy and iden- tity studies as well.  Additional scholarship needs to explore identity and immersion in other genres of videogames besides v–RPGs. Both Vishnu and Shiva in their ini- tial interviews stressed the importance of narrative to immersive videogam- ing experiences. Yet both participants admitted that they were more interested in exploring Vvardenfell than furthering the game’s main narrative. Vishnu indicated that the lack of a narrative history for Steve! kept him from caring about the avatar as much as he otherwise might have. Neither Tom nor Bianca cared about the main narratives of their games at all, seeking instead to move from “point A to point B” because “that’s where the action was.” When asked what  he  liked  best  about Morrowind,  Vishnu  emphatically  answered  “the gameworld.” Shiva also stressed how important navigating Vvardenfell’s ter- rain was to her immersion. It seems clear that the space of a v–RPG plays an important role in the identiﬁcatory experience. Morrowind’s diegetic space offers both verisimilitude and verisimulacratude. It can be navigated slowly on foot or quickly via silt strider or magical teleportation, and it contains a large variety of diverse locations to explore. It is likely all of these spatial vari- ables play an important role in the game’s immersive potential. The point of   172  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  view  through  which  the  terrain  is  navigated  may  also  be  important.  Cer- tainly, the rhetoric of videogame spaces remains undertheorized. This is true not just in v–RPGs but all other genres of videogames as well. Does spatial immersion happen differently in ﬁrst-person shooter videogames than it does in v–RPGs? How, and why? This study demonstrates the need for additional analyses of videogame spaces and how data in future studies might be col- lected.  All of the participants in this study demonstrated that the body of their avatars was signiﬁcant. Each participant clearly put thought and effort into the  appearance  of  their  avatar  bodies;  being  able  to  view  the  virtual  body seemed to aid in identiﬁcation. As I discussed in chapter two, several schol- ars   including  Haraway  and  Stone   have  theorized  about  the  connections between body and identity. Giddens also believed that the mind’s perception of the body mattered in self-identity: “Regularized control of the body is a fundamental means whereby a biography of self-identity is maintained”  57 . This connection is problematized in interesting ways in videogame avatars, which are controlled in the way Giddens describes: is a physical body neces- sarily essential to identity? In Why Videogames are Good for Your Soul Gee describes  the  connections  between  identity  and  the  body  in  the  following way:  “Identity  [is]  a  state  of  mind,  a  value  system.  Seeing  and  action  are deeply  connected  for  human  beings....  We  see  the  world  differently  as  we change  our  needs  and  desires  for  action.  [A]  mismatch  between  body  and world is all too common for us humans in the real world. We don’t always feel  a  perfect  match  between  the  world  and  our  body”   51,  54–55 .  Gee’s words here, when considered with the writings of the other identity theorists mentioned above and the data collected for this study, suggest to me that a physical, corporeal body may not be as essential to one’s identity as we might think. What may be essential instead are our mental perceptions about our bodies   or  bodies  in  general .  As  long  as  a  body  is  viewable  in  one’s  own mind, might it not have the potential to impact one’s own self-identiﬁcation and thus one’s identity? This is certainly an area in need of further study as well.  It is also important that future scholarship in videogame and identity theory continue to establish new terminology and adjust existing terms as necessary. This is a pivotal time for the burgeoning ﬁeld of videogame stud- ies:  virtual  spaces,  places,  and  faces  continue  to  demonstrate  increasing sophistication  of  verisimilitude  and  verisimulacratude   and  everywhere  in between on the continuum  with each new generation of videogame tech- nology. Second Life  a virtual online space where virtual employment can be paid in non-virtual currency , Tiger Woods 2009  close-to-photorealistic facial creation and customization options  and Spore  evolutionary control over a   6. Virtual and Non-Virtual Identities  173  species from its single-celled inception through sentient space travel  are but a few of the diegetic spaces and games that currently test existing notions of identiﬁcation and immersion. This continual evolution of the medium offers exciting potential for new media scholars to discover new phenomena in rela- tion to videogame immersion and virtual identity construction and play. The creation and application of accurate terminology will help unify the ﬁeld of study, providing a critical vocabulary through which videogame theorists can participate in the important conversations about how videogame experiences shape identity and are shaped by identity in turn.  It seems likely that debates about identity between modern and post- modern theorists will continue for some time. Yet the participant data ana- lyzed in this study on Morrowind, Oblivion, and Fallout 3 ﬁts smoothly into postmodern notions of identity. I reproduce here a statement from Fuss to demonstrate this fact:  We tend to experience our identities as part of our public personas— the most exposed part of our self ’s surface collisions with a world of other  selves— we  experience  our  identiﬁcations  as  more  private, guarded, evasive ... every identity is actually an identiﬁcation come to light.... Identity is the Self that identiﬁes itself. Identiﬁcation is the psy- chical mechanism that produces self-recognition ... the detour through the other that deﬁnes a self [Identiﬁcation Papers 2].  Can a v–RPG user’s avatar become this “other” through which the player can produce self-recognition? As Vishnu and Shiva demonstrated in this study when creating avatars, users select attributes they want to see embodied in the avatar. Metaphorically  Fuss reminds us that “metaphor” comes from the Greek word meaning “to transport” and that metaphor is the substitution of the one for the other  in identifying with the avatar the gamer acts transfer- entially in what Fuss calls a “rhetorical process of ﬁguration”  Identiﬁcation Papers 6 . And a Morrowind user cannot help but identify with the avatar as they have created it and made decisions through and for the avatar through- out the gaming experience: when to ﬁght, when to ﬂee, when to talk, how to talk, and where to go. These continual decisions made by each user allow for the  many  psychic  self-reﬂections  needed  for  identiﬁcation  as  described  by Fuss— particularly if the outcome of a decision is not desirable. At the same time, the user remains aware that the Morrowind gameworld is not of their own creation — it exists outside of themselves, the virtual creation of others  game designers and programmers . This social awareness is coupled with the user’s non-virtual identity becoming increasingly aware of who their avatar is  the virtual identity . It is also coupled with who the user wants the avatar to be  the projective identity . These connections lead to a consistency in the actions of the avatar over time, forging a “delicious blend” of identities. New   174  MY AVATAR, MY SELF  theoretical spaces and terminologies need to be created to describe and study the processes by which users interact with videogames to blur the already ten- uous  boundaries  between  virtual,  non-virtual,  and  projective  identities. When we’re our avatars, we’re still our selves. Still real. Or virtually real. Or really virtual. You decide.   Appendix  Transcription of Vishnu’s First Two   Hours of Morrowind Gameplay  I include the full transcription of Vishnu’s ﬁrst two hours of recorded gameplay for this study here to illustrate how essential  and time-con- suming  it is to be able to look at every diegetic decision made by a user’s avatar. Ideally, a researcher would record, transcribe, and ana- lyze the entire length of a user’s gaming experience.

Activision,  Coleco,  Commodore, Imagic,  Magnavox,  Mattel,  and  Texas  In- struments all produced console systems in 1983, helping to saturate and crash the video game market.  3. Many more important games and mo- ments in the history and evolution of video games  exist.  For  more  comprehensive  his- torical coverage, see Wolf & Perron  2003 , Wolf   2001 ,  Dombrower   1998 ,  and Gamespot’s “The History of Video Games.” 4. The term “avatar” was ﬁrst used in a virtual  context  in  1985  in  the  popular Ul- tima series of video role-playing games. Ul- tima IV  1985  named the player character “Avatar”  and  later  games  in  the  series  fol- lowed  suit.  Other  early  video  games  to speciﬁcally use the term in-game were Habi- tat  1987  and Shadowrun  1989 . The term was ﬁrst used to refer to an online virtual body in Neal Stephenson’s 1992 cyberpunk classic  Snow  Crash.  These  important  texts helped to familiarize video game users and theorists with the term and it has been used with increasing frequency  albeit inconsis- tently  since the mid 1990’s in MUDs, video games,  and  to  refer  to  Instant  Messenger icons.  Another  landmark  cyberpunk  text ought to be mentioned here as well: William Gibson’s Neuromancer. Released in 1985, the novel engrained the term “cyberspace” into popular consciousness. Gibson’s notions of the beneﬁts and risks of cyberspace interac- tion  resonate  within  much  of  the  scholar- ship quoted in this study.  5. In RPG worlds, players create avatars to  control  and  role-play.  But  many  other characters are needed to ﬂesh out the gam- ing experience and make the RPG world dy- namic.  For  example,  the  player’s  avatar might discover a small inn located near the path they are traveling on. Staying at the inn is not free: the innkeeper must be talked to, and  the  price  of  lodging  ascertained.  The innkeeper  is  not  being  role-played  by  the user,  but  rather  by  the  dungeon  master, since  the  innkeeper  is  a  “static”  character whose attributes never change and who will likely never be seen in the RPG again once the  avatar  leaves  the  inn  and  ventures  on. Many  such  non-player  characters   NPCs  incorporate an RPG world, usually located in strategic spots to aid the avatar in some manner   such  as  providing  food,  shelter, and  new  equipment   or  provide  informa- tion to help further the current quest or nar- rative arc.  6. Among  the  more  popular  table-top RPGs that capitalized on Dungeons & Drag- ons’ success were Tunnels and Trolls  1975 , Traveller  1977 , and Runequest  1978 .  7. PLATO   Programmed  Logic  for  Au- tomatic  Teaching  Operations   was  one  of the ﬁrst computer-assisted instruction sys- tems  and  was  created  at  the  University  of Illinois.  8. As you’ve likely already guessed, I am an avid videogame player. I estimate that I logged  over  200  hours  playing  Morrowind and over 100 hours so far in Oblivion. I re- main fascinated by the large scope of both gameworlds and the open-ended nature of the  choices  available  to  the  avatars.  If  one wants to study video games, one must also play video games  just as a ﬁlm critic must watch a ﬁlm to be able to critique it . All of my gameplay time in Morrowind was spent  185   186  NOTES—CHAPTER 2  with  one  avatar,  a  dark  Elf  female  named Zaara. All of my Oblivion experiences have been  with  a  Wood  Elf  named  Zach   who looks suspiciously like me .  9. Bethesda’s  Elder  Scrolls series  pio- neered  open-ended  worlds  and  freeform gameplay,  where  players  could  go  and  do whatever they wanted. The series began in 1994  with  the  release  of Arena,  continued with Daggerfall in 1996, Morrowind in 2002 and Oblivion in 2006. Each game is popu- larly known without the Elder Scrolls desig- nation; henceforth in this study I will refer to  the  games  simply  as  Morrowind and Oblivion.  10. Bethesda  Softworks  website   www. bethsoft.com news    lists  several  of  the gaming  magazines  and  websites  that  se- lected Morrowind as 2002’s best videogame and  Oblivion as  2006’s  best  videogame. Among  them  are  Gamespot,  Gamespy, Game Chronicles, and USA Today.  11. For  example,  on  August  22,  2007, there were 296 different topic threads in the Elderscrolls Morrowind forum. Among these were questions related to the game  “What does  the  Pool  of  Forgetfulness  do?”  “Can you become a vampire while carrying vam- pire  dust?” ,  surveys  related  to  the  game  “What  is  the  best  weapon  in  the  game?” “What  is  the  worst  town  or  city  in  the game?” , and threads solely devoted to the statistics and attributes of the users’ avatars. Many other types of threads exist as well.  12. In Morrowind and Oblivion, skooma is  an  extremely  addictive  illegal  narcotic, similar  to  crack  cocaine  or  heroin.  Many NPCs in the game will not even speak to the user’s  avatar  if  the  avatar  has  skooma  in their possession.  13. As previously noted, part of the ap- peal  of  v-RPGs  is  the  ability  to  customize the avatar, both at the beginning of the game and as the gameplay progresses. The avatar continually gains experience in Morrowind by repeatedly using their skills  whether the skills be swinging a sword, casting spells, re- pairing armor; bartering with NPCs, etc. . When a certain number of skills have been increased,  the  avatar  may  then  “level  up”: the user is allowed to choose which primary attributes to strengthen. A level ﬁve charac- ter indicates very little progression in terms of strengthening the avatar’s skills and over-  all abilities. The maximum level for all at- tributes and skills is 100.  14. In  the  Elder  Scrolls  universe,  the khajiit  are  a  feline-like  species:  the  user’s avatar  may  be  khajiit  if  they  wish.  Khajiit NPCs  encountered  in  the  game  will  often say, “Khajiit has no words for you” to some- one  usually the avatar  they are disgusted by. It is the greatest verbal insult the species can utter.  15. Corprus  is  a  contagious,  incurable disease  which  distorts  the  features  of  the victim  and  effectively  turns  them  into  a mindless zombie. Catching corprus is one of the greatest fears of Morrowind’s denizens. 16. This quest in Morrowind can only be completed if the avatar avoids detection by any NPCs on the way to the shrine. This re- quires stealthy movement and no speaking to any other diegetic characters.  Chapter 2  1. I discuss theories of narrativity and their relationship to identity in greater de- tail later in this chapter.  2. Stuart Moulthrop’s Storyspace, a hy- pertext writing environment, was one of the ﬁrst programs to allow authors to produce the  types  of  narratives  Murray  describes. Michael Joyce’s afternoon, a story  1986  and Moulthrop’s  own  Victory  Garden  1992  were among the earliest examples of hyper- text ﬁction.  3. Most  v-RPGs  have  narrative  plots that revolve around the user’s avatar. In Fall- out 2, for example, the avatar is known as The  Chosen  One   the  intriguee ,  and  the game’s  opening  cinematic  reveals  that  the avatar  has  been  selected  to  save  his her  village  from  extinction.  Thus,  the  game’s central  plot  line   the  intrigue   cannot  be achieved  without  the  avatar.  In  this  way, users are made to feel essential to the game- play  experience:  the  “non-trivial  impact” mentioned  by  McMahon  earlier  as  neces- sary to create immersion.  4. Wolf lists and describes the following eleven types of videogame space: no visual space   all  text-based ;  one  screen,  con- tained;  one  screen,  contained,  with  wrap- around; scrolling on one axis; scrolling on two axes; adjacent spaces displayed one at a   Notes—Chapter 3  187  time; layers of independently moving planes  multiple scrolling backgrounds ; spaces al- lowing z-axis movement into and out of the frame;  multiple,  nonadjacent  spaces  dis- played  on-screen  simultaneously;  interac- tive  three-dimensional  environment;  and represented or mapped spaces. Most video- games may represent several of these types of diegetic space at the same time.  5. Interactive  3D  space  can  take  many forms  in  video  games  and  is  applicable  in both  ﬁrst  and  third-person  point  of  view games.  Some  examples  of  interactive  3D spaces  can  be  found  in World  of  Warcraft, Halo, Oblivion, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Crysis, and Gears of War.  6. Many video games allow users to ac- cess a map of some kind to help them ori- ent  themselves  in  the  gameworld.  These maps appear in a separate window and may be viewed while the game is paused. Typi- cally in games where exploration is impor- tant, unexplored sections of the gameworld map remain unviewable  referred to as “the fog of war”  until the user’s avatar or agent explores  them.  Examples  of  video  games that  feature  map  components  are  Doom, Baldur’s Gate, SimCity, Grand Theft Auto III, and Bioshock.  Chapter 3  1. Indeed, a qualitative study seemed ap- propriate for this study’s research questions, especially  when  considering  how  Denzin and  Lincoln  characterize  qualitative  re- search in their Handbook of Qualitative Re- search: “Qualitative researchers attempt to make  sense  of  or  interpret  phenomena  in terms of the meanings people bring to them. Qualitative research involves the studied use and collection of a variety of empirical ma- terials that describe routine and problematic moments and meaning in individuals’ lives”  2 . My study investigated the construction of avatars  virtual identities  by users  non- virtual identities  to ascertain how the rela- tionship between the two develops and how they inform each other via passage through a liminal space, the projective identity. This study ﬁts Denzin’s and Lincoln’s criterion of interpreting a phenomenon that has mean- ing in the participants’ lives. Creswell’s dis-  tinction between qualitative and quantita- tive studies also serves to clarify an appro- priate  methodological  approach  for  my study as he points out that “quantitative re- searchers  work  with  a  few  variables  and many cases, whereas qualitative researchers rely  on  a  few  cases  and  many  variables”  15–16 . There are many variables that may impact user identiﬁcation with their avatar in a v-RPG: the game’s narrative, the gam- ing interface, the avatar, and the spatial en- vironment of the gameworld all may play a role. These constitute the “many variables” mentioned  by  Creswell  here,  who  goes  on to suggest that qualitative studies are appro- priate if “the research question often starts with a how or a what so that initial forays into the topic describe what is going on” and “the topic needs to be explored, [the] vari- ables  cannot  be  easily  identiﬁed”   17 . Again, my research questions and topic ﬁt these guidelines for qualitative research.  Of  course,  there  are  many  disciplinary and or methodological approaches to qual- itative research. I also had to decide which tradition  of  inquiry  was  most  appropriate for this study. Creswell’s Qualitative Inquiry and  Research  Design clearly  identiﬁes  ﬁve different  types  of  qualitative  traditions  of inquiry:  biographies,  case  studies,  ethno- graphies,  phenomenologies,  and  grounded theories. The focus of each tradition is quite different. Biographies explore the life of an individual in great detail. Phenomenologi- cal  studies  attempt  to  understand  the essence of experiences around a phenome- non. Grounded theory research develops a theory  grounded  in  data  from  the  ﬁeld. Ethnographies describe and interpret social groups,  and  case  studies  develop  in-depth analysis  of  a  single  case  or  multiple  cases  Creswell 65 . My study met Creswell’s cri- teria for a phenomenological study since it “focuses not on the individual but rather on a concept or phenomenon and seeks to un- derstand  the  meaning  of  experiences  of  individuals  about  this  phenomenon”   38 . As  mentioned  above,  the  phenomenon  of my study is liminal projective identity. Of course, my project also presents brief case studies to study this phenomenon: there is a “bounded system”  the diegetic gameworld and limitations of the v-RPG itself   and in- depth data collection from multiple sources   188  NOTES—CHAPTER 3  of information  61 , both characteristics of case studies. However, I have focused on the phenomenon produced by the users’ game- play  sessions  rather  than  the  users  them- selves and thus I privilege phenomenologi- cal methodologies in this study.  2. Drawing on Dukes  1984  and Riemen  1986  Creswell recommends a phenomeno- logical study of three to ten subjects, sug- gesting  that  “with  an  in-depth  interview lasting as long as 2 hours” three to ten sub- jects represents a reasonable size of partici- pants   122 .  Ten  subjects  interviewed  for two hours each would produce twenty hours of  data  that  would  need  to  be  transcribed and analyzed. For my study, I collected data not only through interviews with my partic- ipants   initial  interviews  lasting  an  hour each  and  follow-up  interviews  lasting  ap- proximately  two  hours  each ,  but  also  by recording  and  transcribing  each  partici- pant’s ﬁrst ten hours of gameplay in the v- RPGs  Morrowind and  Oblivion.  Given  this additional videogame data collected and the time needed to transcribe it for analysis and follow-up  interviews   approximately  40 hours  needed  to  transcribe  each  partici- pant’s ten hours of gameplay , I selected two participants for this portion of the study so that the scope of the project remained man- ageable while still allowing me to collect rel- evant data.  3. Both  Morrowind participants’  names have been changed at their request to pro- tect their identities. To honor the Sanskrit and Hindu origins of the word “avatar” I se- lected Vishnu and Shiva as pseudonyms for the participants. Both are the names of the avatars of Hindu deities. It was also impor- tant  to  select  a  pseudonym  for  the  female participant that showed the close relation- ship between the name she selected for her Morrowind avatar and her birth name. Se- lecting Shiva as a pseudonym for her accom- plished this.  4. The  Star  Wars trilogy  takes  place  on many different planets and Hoth is one such planet. In The Empire Strikes Back, Hoth is the location of the Rebel Base until discov- ered by the Imperials. One of the ﬁlm’s epic battles takes place as the Imperial All Ter- rain Attack Transports  AT-ATs  attack the Rebel  base,  defended  by  the  Rebel  snow- speeders.  It  is  this  battle  that  Vishu  refers  to, as many Star Wars video games over the years have recreated this famous battle.  5. Certainly, Tom’s experiences in Obliv- ion discussed in chapter four seem to illus- trate this fact.  6. It  was  also  crucial  that  both  partici- pants have the technological capacity to play Morrowind on  their  home  computing  sys- tems.  The  participants  would  be  playing Morrowind’s  Game  of  the  Year  Edition which included Morrowind’s two expansion packs, Tribunal and Bloodmoon. The follow- ing  list  contains  the  minimum  system speciﬁcations needed to play this edition of Morrowind:    An operating system of Windows 98, Windows 2000, or Windows XP with 128 megabytes  MB  of Random Access Memory  RAM .   A processor of at least 500 mega-  hertz  MHz     An 8x CD DVD Read-Only Mem-  ory  ROM  drive    One  gigabyte   GB   of  free  hard  disk space   DirectX 8.1   32  MB  Direct  3D  compatible video card with 32-bit color sup- port    A  DirectX  8.1 compatible  driver  and sound card    A keyboard, monitor, and mouse Morrowind’s  Game  of  the  Year  edition was released in 2003. Both Vishnu and Shiva had  purchased  new  home  computing  sys- tems in 2005. Vishnu’s PC ran on Windows XP  and  contained  512  MB  of  RAM.  His computer’s processor was a Pentium 4 with 3.2 gigahertz  GHz , and his video card was a  128  MB  nVidia  GeForce  FX  5300.  The computer Shiva gamed on ran on Windows XP  and  contained  one  GB  of  RAM.  The computer’s processor was a Pentium 4 with 2.4 GHz with a 128 MB Image Quest L70S Radeon  9200  video  card.  These  system speciﬁcations  more  than  met  the  require- ments to play Morrowind.  To  record  my  participants’  Morrowind gameplay, I excluded the possibility of using a video camera mounted on a tripod for a few important reasons. First, this method is somewhat obtrusive, and the presence of the camera lurking behind the participant could   Notes—Chapter 3  189  serve  as  a  reminder  that  the  user’s  virtual actions were being scrutinized thus prevent- ing  immersion  or  inﬂuencing  the  diegetic choices. Second, as anyone who has ever at- tempted to video record a television moni- tor or computer screen in this manner can attest to, the recorder is able to pick up the constant  ﬂicker  of  the  screen  that  is  typi- cally  imperceptible  to  our  eyes.  This  pul- sating  ﬂicker  is  distracting  at  best,  and headache-inducing at worst; attempting to analyze over 20 hours of such tape would be extremely difﬁcult as Morrowind has many icons that appear regularly on the screen and text  boxes  with  small  print.  Being  able  to follow the user’s diegetic choices is crucial and video recording in this manner would have presented an opportunity for data to be misinterpreted  or  lost.  Instead,  I  used  a computer  software  program  named  Fraps  www.fraps.com  that enabled me to record the participants’ gameplay directly onto an external hard drive.  7. Users are free to pick any ﬁve of the available  27  skills  to  tag  as  Major  Skills. These  ﬁve  Major  Skills  start  with  a  higher proﬁciency rating than the other skills; the avatar  also  improves  these  skills  more quickly.  Only  improvement  in  these  ﬁve skills contribute to the avatar “leveling up.” 8. Among the many scholar works de- voted to MMORPGs are R.V. Kelly’s Mas- sively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games and all of the articles in edition 1.4 of Games and Culture  2006 .  9. The  Morrowind  Prophecies lists  391 side quests that can be undertaken outside of  the  main  quest  storyline.  Of  these,  292 are  factional  quests,  taken  on  if  the  avatar chooses to join one of the guilds  Fighters Guild, Thieves Guild, or Imperial Cult, for example  or Great Houses  House Redoran, House Hlaalu, House Telvanni . 65 miscel- laneous quests also exist, random encoun- ters  with  NPCs  waiting  to  be  kairotically discovered  in  the  gameworld.  Finally,  34 themed miscellaneous quests are listed, such as  collecting  a  copy  of  each  book  in  Mor- rowind or  freeing  all  of  the  slaves  in  the game,  “unofﬁcial”  quests  that  are  never speciﬁcally  referenced  within  the  diegetic gameworld.  10. Chronos in Morrowind pauses when the user enters the inventory screen, giving  the  user  time  to  study  their  inventory,  the avatar’s attributes and skills, the game maps, their spells, and the journal. As soon as the user exits the inventory and returns to the “normal” gameworld view, chronos begins to run again.  11. Sandbox or God games place the user outside of the gameworld in an omnipotent position from which the user sees the entire gameworld and manipulates it at will, mak- ing all decisions that affect that world. Sid Meier’s  Civilization,  RollerCoaster  Tycoon, and Populous are among the popular strat- egy games in this genre.  12. Morrowind’s  decision  to  force  the user  to  play  in  ﬁrst-person  point  of  view  POV  until completing the avatar’s initial construction  is  well  considered.  Until  the user has selected from the gender, racial, fa- cial,  and  hair  options,  no  picture  of  the avatar can exist. Once all of these decisions have  been  made  and  Socucius  Ergalla  in- structs the avatar to take their release papers off his desk, the user is free to access their in- ventory and change the POV.  13. Shiva’s  comment  here  refers  to  her desire to select a race strategically based on how  she  wanted  to  play.  Shiva  wanted  to play a balanced character, one that could en- gage in both physical combat and magical combat  effectively.  Knowing  this  ahead  of time, she studied each racial option looking for  one  that  had  strong  ratings  in  Intelli- gence   important  for  casting  spells   and Strength  important for melee combat .  14. The pre-existing classes already have names  assigned  to  them.  Combat  classes have names like Warrior, Knight and Archer; magic classes have names like Mage, Night- blade,  and  Sorcerer;  stealth  classes  have names like Thief, Bard, and Acrobat. Users creating their own custom classes can name the class anything they want  thus increas- ing the identiﬁcation potential .  15. For  example,  six  combat  answers, three stealth answers, and one magic answer ﬁrmly  situate  the  avatar  as  a  combat-class Barbarian. Six combat answers, three magic answers,  and  one  stealth  answer  is  still  a combat-based class but is a Crusader. Each of  the  21 classes  corresponds  to  a  ratio  of  the  types  of  answers   combat,  magic,  and stealth  given to the ten questions.  16. None of the ten questions are directly   190  NOTES—CHAPTER 3  tied to the Morrowind gameworld. The user must answer these questions before any in- volvement in the game’s story or world or any awareness of what the answers mean in terms of assigning the avatar’s class. There- fore, the user must by default draw on the proclivities  of  their  real-world  identities when answering these questions.  17. “Turn Undead” is a popular fantasy RPG  spell.  It  is  usually  available  to  mem- bers  of  the  clergy  and  refers  to  the  spell’s ability to “increase an undead creature’s ﬂee rating   its  inclination  to  ﬂee  from  an  at- tacker ”  Hines and Cheng 30 .  18. As is typical of ﬁrst-person perspec- tives, only the arms and hands of the avatar are  visible  from  the  elbows  on  down.  The appearance  of  the  arms  does  change  how- ever  depending  on  the  types  of  gloves  or gauntlets the avatar is wearing and the type of weapon they are holding.  19. In this instance chronos refers to the passage of day and night in the Morrowind gameworld  of  Vvardenfell.  Certain  quests make use of the game’s chronos. For exam- ple,  if  the  avatar  joins  House  Hlaalu  and rises  in  rank,  eventually  House  members will construct a house for the avatar. Con- struction of the house takes place in phases, each lasting several weeks. By paying atten- tion to the gameworld’s chronos the avatar can monitor when tasks will be completed or how long they have to achieve quest goals. 20. Each  NPC  the  Morrowind avatar speaks to has a pre-established Disposition toward the avatar from zero to one hundred. The higher the number, the more the NPC likes the avatar, and the more likely the NPC is to talk to you or offer you particular serv- ices. Users can attempt to alter their Dispo- sition with a particular NPC through select- ing one of four different types of Persuasion: Admire,  Taunt,  Intimidate,  and  Bribe.  If these  attempts  are  successful   determined by the avatar’s Speechcraft and Mercantile skills ,  the  NPC’s  Disposition  towards  the avatar  goes  up.  If  the  attempt  fails,  the NPC’s Disposition drops even lower.  21. One room in the Census and Excise Ofﬁce  is  free  of  guards,  which  allows  the avatar to successfully steal all the items in the room if they wish. In this way the avatar can  obtain  their  ﬁrst  weapon   a  dagger , some  food,  and  other  miscellaneous  items  to sell for a few gold. New avatars users in video  games  are  commonly  referred  to  as “newbies” and this room in the Census and Excise  Ofﬁce  is  clearly  designed  to  give  newbie players a few items for their inven- tory.  22. Addamasartus  is  a  large  cave  just outside  of  Seyda  Neen.  It  contains  several slavers  who attack the avatar on sight  and a room full of slaves who the avatar can free if they so wish. Crates and barrels scattered throughout the cave contain miscellaneous items  that  can  be  looted.  Addamasartus  is located  near  Seyda  Neen’s  siltstrider  port  which  offers  fast  travel  to  nearby  towns . Perhaps predictably, both Vishnu and Shiva discovered Addamasartus within their ﬁrst two hours of Morrowind gameplay.  23. If the avatar can ﬁnd a safe place to rest,  doing  so  will  replenish  their  health, magicka,  and  fatigue  points.  Resting  can take  place  anywhere  in  the  wilderness  as long as creatures are not nearby. In towns, the avatar must ﬁnd a bed to rest in legally  in a tavern or a guild if the avatar is a mem- ber .  24. Vishnu  is  correct: Morrowind does make an ethical distinction between killing and murdering. If an NPC attacks the avatar  initiates  the  physical  combat ,  the  avatar has the right to defend herself. If this com- bat leads to the death of the offending NPC, the avatar has committed no crime. This is killing  and  carries  no  legal  penalty.  If  the avatar  initiates  combat  with  an  NPC  in  a town  and  kills  that  NPC,  this  is  murder. Town  guards  will  attempt  to  arrest  the avatar  for  this  crime.  However,  this  rule only applies to attacks and kills made in civ- ilized areas  towns and forts . The avatar is free to attack and kill any NPC discovered in the wilderness  caves, strongholds, ruins, and encampments are all considered part of the wilderness  without the action being rec- ognized as legally criminal.  25. The many dozen books that can be discovered and read in Morrowind bring the gameworld to life. Many of the books pro- vide historical lore about Morrowind. Oth- ers describe native ﬂora and fauna. Still oth- ers  tell  exciting  tales  of  adventure  and mystery  clearly intended to be ﬁctive works written  by  the  ﬁctional  denizens  of  the land .  Morrowind users  who  spend  time   Notes—Chapters 4 and 5   191  reading the books enrich their knowledge of the virtual land they are exploring.  26. Morrowind avatars can only carry a limited amount of items in their inventory. This  is  referred  to  as  the  avatar’s  Encum- brance. The total weight the avatar can carry is  determined  by  their  Strength  attribute: the  higher  the  Strength  rating  the  more weight   and  the  greater  number  of  items  the  avatar  can  carry.  If  the  avatar  exceeds the Encumbrance weight, the avatar is un- able to move until they drop enough items to reduce their Encumbrance below its max- imum  value.  By  carrying  books  in  his  in- ventory  yet  never  reading  them  or  selling them,  Vishnu  is  in  essence  carrying  dead weight that takes up space without reward. 27. Both  Shiva  and  Vishnu  admitted they read the Morrowind game manual be- fore  beginning  the  game.  On  the  second page of the game manual in a ﬁve paragraph “Introduction to Morrowind” the designers stress the vast freeform gameworld: “Huge, detailed, and open-ended are words that fre- quently come up when talking about Mor- rowind…One minute you may be gazing up at the moon and stars over the plains or out for a swim in the Sea of Ghosts, and running for  your  life  from  a  cliff  racer  or  slaugh- terﬁsh the next. Vvardenfell is a culturally and  geographically  diverse  place.  Mor- rowind is ﬁlled with things for you to do … hundreds and hundreds of things. No mat- ter what your preference, there’s no right or wrong way to play Morrowind”  Hines and Cheng 2 . With this awareness both partic- ipants were alerted to the fact that they were free  to  wander  in  the  large  gameworld  in non-linear fashion and each was eager to do so.  Chapter 4  1. Four of the Skills available in Mor- rowind were  removed  in  Oblivion:  Spear, Unarmored, Enchant, and Medium Armor. The Long Blade and Short Blade Skills were combined into a single Blade skill, and the Axe  skill  was  combined  with  the  Blunt Weapon skill.  2. Tom’s admission that he had played Baldur’s Gate  another PC-RPG  surprised me, as he had been adamant that Alternate  Reality had been his only v-RPG experience before this project. When I questioned him on this, it became clear that Tom was refer- ring to the Playstation 2 version of Baldur’s Gate, which was very light on the RPG ele- ments  and  heavy  on  combat  action:  very much  a  “hack-n-slash”  gaming  experience rather than a roleplaying experience.  3. For example, there are icons that con- vey an item’s value in gold, an item’s weight, how  much  damage  a  weapon  causes,  how much  armor  protection  an  item  provides, the quality of the item, and an item’s health  an  item’s  condition  degrades  with  usage; the lower its health, the less effective or pow- erful it is . There are also icons that indicate if  items  are  magical,  poisoned,  stolen,  or broken. Each spell also has its own icon as well. As a result, there are a few dozen dif- ferent icons for the gamer to memorize.  Chapter 5  1. Future dystopia has long been a pop- ular  genre  in  science  ﬁction  novels.  Along with Stirling’s works, George Stewart’s Earth Abides was  one  early  critically  acclaimed novel in this genre. Of course, Orwell’s 1984 is also clearly future dystopian. Long a sta- ple among the fanatical science ﬁction com- munity, future dystopian works continue to gain  mainstream  popularity,  as  demon- strated by the Will Smith vehicle I Am Leg- end,  the  TV  show  Jericho,  and  the  British ﬁlm Doomsday  an homage to John Carpen- ter’s Escape from New York .  2. These Skills are Small Guns, Big Guns, Energy Weapons, Unarmed, Melee Weapons, Throwing, First Aid, Doctor, Sneak, Lock- pick, Steal, Traps, Science, Repair, Speech, Barter, Gambling, and Outdoorsman. You can clearly see how similar these are to the skills  of  Morrowind  and  Oblivion.  Most deep  v-RPGs  provide  improvable  skills  in this  vein.  After  all,  the  more  choices  the gamer has to make and the more different ways the avatar can improve, the greater the potential for immersive identiﬁcation.  3. The sixteen Traits available in Fallout and Fallout 2 are: Fast Metabolism, Bruiser, Small Frame, One Hander, Finesse, Kami- kaze,  Heavy  Handed,  Fast  Shot,  Bloody Mess, Jinxed, Good Natured, Chem Reliant,   192  NOTES—CHAPTER 5  Chem  Resistant,  Sex  Appeal,  Skilled,  and Gifted.  4. Fallout’s “Best of All Time” rankings include  number  twenty-one  on  games- radar.com  and  number  thirty-three  on IGN.com’s 2007 ranking.  5. The  new  thirteen  Skills  in Fallout  3 are  Barter,  Big  Guns,  Energy  Weapons,  Explosives,  Lockpick,  Medicine,  Melee Weapons,  Repair,  Science,  Small  Guns, Sneak, Speech, and Unarmed.  6. Nintendo’s Wii gaming system allows users to create simplistic avatars that can be  used in the Wii Sports games. Each avatar is called a “mii.” Rather than the highly cus- tomizable Oblivion avatars, mii avatars are caricature-like and much more cartoon-like and cutsey.  7. Question  One  on  the  GOAT  asks, “You are approached by a frenzied vault sci- entist who yells, ‘I’m going to put my quan- tum  harmonizer  in  your  photonic  res- onation  chamber!’  What  do  you  do?”  As Bianca didn’t understand the question, she was at a loss as to how to answer.
