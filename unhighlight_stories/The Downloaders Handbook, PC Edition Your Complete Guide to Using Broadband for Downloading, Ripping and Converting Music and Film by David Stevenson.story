The  book  is  not  written  for  techies,  although  the  chapters  on  file  sharing networks and copyright should be interesting for them. Rather, this book is for the ordinary PC user. Someone, say, who knows how to use a PC for writing letters and email, but has not played about much with music and video on the computer.   Finally,  this  book  is  for  PC,  not  Mac,  users.  On  Planet  Mac  things  are  very different – and arguably better organised and easier – but this book isn’t for you.  How the book is structured This book takes you by the hand and walks you through every step required to start using your computer as an entertainment centre.  I’ll quickly run through the chapters in this book.  1. Computer Hardware  The books starts off with a checklist of minimum requirements your computer should  have  to  play  music  and  video.  This  includes  things  like  the  memory, hard  disk,  sound  card and  monitor.  I  also  explain  how  to  upgrade  each component, if this proves necessary.  2. Securing Your Computer  Your  next  step  is  to  make  sure  your  computer  is  safe  and  secure.  That’s  the subject of this chapter. I’ll talk you through all the security basics you need to make  sure  you’re  safe  online.  At  the  end,  I’ll  run  you  through  a  ten  point checklist of ‘Safety Essentials’.   vii   The Downloader’s Handbook  3. Digital Music  In this chapter I look at the various software-based music players available, and the various ways that music from a CD is turned into a digital format and then compressed into files small enough to store by the hundred.  After you’ve read this chapter you’ll be able to:  ‘Rip’ a CD onto your hard drive.  1. 2. Play that music on your PC. 3. Convert  that  music  into  a  smaller  file  that  can  be  played  on  any  PC  or  4. Learn about different file formats, including MP3, MP4, WMA, OGG and  portable MP3 player.  MPC.  5. Work out how to best use the popular Windows Media Player. 6. Record internet radio broadcasts. 7. Decide which portable MP3 player to buy.  4. Online Music Services  We then move on to online music services. We go online and sample some of the fantastic, legal music download services like iTunes and Napster. I’ll also introduce you to some smaller, but equally brilliant, music services like emusic and Wippit.  In this chapter you’ll learn how to:  1. Use the iTunes music player and download music from the iTunes music  2. Sign on and use the Napster service. 3. Access  the  superb  emusic online  service  with  its  wealth  of  alternative  4. Work with the Audible audio books service.  store.  music.  viii   Preface  5. Digital Video  In the  digital  video  chapter  we  look  at  the  fastest  growing  area  of  internet downloading – film and video. More and more users are moving beyond music and  starting  to  download  video  such  as  films  and  pop  promos.  But  the technology involved with these downloads can, initially, be quite daunting. The world of video is full of nasty sounding formats and even stranger sounding codecs. And if you ever decide to get into the business of backing up your DVD films onto a hard drive  a great idea for all you film fans  you could soon find yourself  sinking  into  an  ocean  of  strange  terminology  and  even  stranger programs.   Don’t panic! This chapter will teach you how to:  1. Stream pop promos and short movie clips over the internet. 2. Work with codecs that turn movies into relatively small 600MB files. 3. Use simple media players that will play virtually every format under the  sun.  4. Back up your DVDs onto your hard drive. 5. Get compressed movies onto a DVD that can then be played on your TV.  6. File Sharing Networks  Once you’ve acquainted yourself with all the codecs and players, it’s time to start  sourcing  the  content  online.  That’s  where  the  chapter  on  file  sharing networks comes  in  –  it’ll  walk  you  through  the  process  of  deciding  which network to use and then explain what these networks consist of and how to use them. After reading this chapter you’ll understand:  1. The principle behind file sharing network; 2. How to work out which network to use; 3. The wonders of BitTorrent; and 4. How to use the slightly more complicated eMule network.  7. Copyright And The Law  In the last chapter we get to the knotty issue of copyright – what’s legal, and what isn’t.   ix   The Downloader’s Handbook  How this book will help you  By the end of this book you should be able to:  Download music from any of the major online music services.  Play all types of music on your computer. Rip and burn music.  1. 2. 3. Work out what kind of MP3 player to buy. 4. 5. Work with every major video film format. 6. 7. 8.  Compress a film file into 600MB Back-up all your DVDs on to your computer. Download tens of thousands of different files available on BitTorrent and eMule. Know how to make your computer safe and secure.  9. 10. Understand your legal position.  How to read this book For some readers, especially those whose computer skills are rudimentary, I’d recommend  going  through  this  book  reading  each  chapter  in  turn.  More experienced computer users can use this book as a reference guide, dipping into chapters where they want to improve their knowledge.   I provide a rough guide below to how certain types of readers might want to approach this book.   Patient beginners These readers should start with chapter one, and then work step by step through the whole book. The first two chapters may not be that exciting, but they are extremely important, especially the second chapter on security. The internet offers an incredible opportunity to download music and video, but there is a cost, and that cost is extra vigilance. Charge onto the internet, downloading without  making  sure  your  computer  is  secure,  and  I  can assure you grief will follow!     x   Preface     Impatient beginners If  you  really  want  to  get  straight  to  the  meat,  then  by  all  means  jump straight to chapter 3 on digital music, or chapter 5 on video. This will give you a flavour of what’s possible. But then, before launching yourself into downloading madly, do read chapter 2 to check that your system is secure.     Advanced  For advanced readers, you might like to skim the early chapters, and then go straight to those on file sharing networks and copyright.  Remember computing is a fast moving industry. Every effort has been made to ensure that all the information was as accurate and up to date as possible at the time of writing.

I can’t remember what my reaction was, but I do remember that it was very bulky, made of horrible plastic and seemed to do a small number of things, very slowly. After an hour or two playing around on it I decided it was about as exciting as a wet fish, and so I went back to kicking a football in the garden.  Many years passed before I finally got a proper PC – back in the mid nineties – and my enthusiasm was starting to smoulder into a passion. I’m no computer programmer or hacker – don’t expect pages and pages of complicated code and programming language in this book – but I love computers for what they can do to make my life easier and fun.   And  then  the  internet  arrived,  with  its  email  and  web  pages.  A  fantastic development. But computers themselves, though a lot more powerful than my dad’s early Apple, weren’t exactly exciting. Just useful.  Fast forward ten years to today. Suddenly, ordinary home PCs are starting to do some amazing things.  Yes,  computers  are  still  used  by  most  of  us  for  mundane  stuff  like word processing or sending emails, but recently PCs have been transformed. They’re now multimedia powerhouses.  Connect it to the internet and you can acquire music from around the world, edit it, and then build up huge compilations that can be played back on devices that have no resemblance to a PC. Video is now commonplace on computers as PCs  turn  into  home  entertainment  centres.  Everything  enjoyable  about  our media-soaked  world  has  started  to  migrate  from  the  lounge  –  with  its  old- school electronics appliances – into the study, the home of the PC.   Let me give you an example.   I love films and music. In fact, I like them so much that I’ve acquired hundreds of DVDs along with thousands of CDs. But I hate CDs and DVDs, the stuff that these movies and music come on. I still remember that laughable Tomorrow’s  xiii   The Downloader’s Handbook  World item that purported to show that CDs were virtually indestructible. The presenter smeared all sorts of sticky stuff on them and then tried to break them. Miraculously these sturdy CDs survived. Case proved.   Far from it. The Tomorrow’s World report was, as we all know by now, complete cobblers. These early pioneers had obviously never scratched a CD or DVD; in my experience these optical media are about as reliable as vinyl, if not worse!  Step forward my media server.  I’ve  collected  my  favourite  films  and  music,  taken  them  off  discs  via  a technology  called  ‘ripping’,  and  then  stored  them  on  a  single  external  hard drive that sits in my lounge. This disk now contains hundreds of albums and movies. Whenever I want to access this entertainment library I simply click on a file in my PC and I’m away – listening or watching the album or movie in any room of the house.   Call me a bit of a geek, but I love it.   Oh,  and  it  gets  better. I’ve  added  to  this  media  library  by downloading files from the internet. Music from Napster, TV programmes from the US and copies of internet radio broadcasts by my favourite DJs.  I present these small snapshots of my own personal computing experience to demonstrate a number of important points that underlie the thinking behind this book.  1. Computers are now fun and exciting. They involve stuff that excites and interests all of us – digital content like film and music. It’s fun. It’s not just data processing and programming.  2. With  the  growth  of  the  internet,  PCs  have  started  talking  to  other computers;  and  as  they’ve  done  this  they’ve  discovered  even  more compelling content online. Some of this is legal, some less so. But there’s a world of content out there, waiting for you!  3. This  book  is  written  from  a  user’s  perspective.  I  don’t  come  at  this  new world  of  networked,  digital  content  from  the  perspective  of  the  techie programmer trying to explain the impossible. I use all the stuff in this book, if not every day, pretty much every week. If I can use what’s described in this book, so can you.  xiv   Introduction  My  message  is  simple:  get  hi-tech,  get  multimedia,  get  online  and  get broadband.   Why?          It’s worth it. The online content available is truly awesome. Everyone else is doing it. Broadband and internet usage rates in the UK are skyrocketing  –  in  fact  they’re  skyrocketing  globally.  And  most  of  that internet traffic is in digital content like film and music. It’s easy. This book will guide you through everything you need to know to access this new world of digital content, both offline on your PC and online through the internet.  xv   The Downloader’s Handbook  Ten statistics to mull over  Let me shoot ten random statistics at you that underline the scale of this multimedia revolution.  1. The legal music download service, iTunes, boasts 1.7 million songs online; the equivalent of more than 100,000 albums. Rival Napster has ‘only’ 1.6 million.  2. Online music service Napster has over 750,000 registered users in  the UK alone. That’s 750,000 more than two years ago.  3. 60%  of  all  traffic  on  the  internet  is  currently  originating  from  a bunch  of  file  sharing  networks with  silly  sounding  names  like BitTorrent, eDonkey and Morpheus.   4. 60% of all that traffic is now in film, not in MP3 music tracks. 5. As of August 2005, there are estimated to be just under 10 million  global users online using file sharing networks at any one time.  6. At one internet service provider, 30% of all its traffic one day was  just one file  a film  being shared over multiple networks.   7. Online  music  networks  and  file  sharing  networks now  boast  files that total 10 petabytes of data. I’m not going to specify how big that is, except to say that it’s thousands of times the amount that existed on Planet Earth just a few decades ago.  8. An estimated 35 million Europeans regularly admit to downloading music and film from legal and non legal networks over the internet. 9. Just one year ago, the majority of UK internet users were using dial- up networking to access the internet. That meant they surfed the internet  at  maximum  speeds  of  56Kbps.  By  summer  2005,  the number of broadband users had exceeded that of dial-up users – all from  a  standing  start  just  four  years  ago.  That  means  broadband users can now surf the net at speeds of at least ten times those of dial-up users. Most speeds are 40 times this level and some cable networks offer speeds that are 80 times dial-up speeds.  10. The availability of broadband is expected to reach 99% of the entire  UK population within a few years.  xvi   Introduction  I’m not expecting you to understand absolutely everything in these statistical snapshots, but hopefully you’ll get the idea there’s a revolution out there!  If this revolution had a chief ideologue  think Lenin for the Russian Revolution  I feel confident he’d make the following statements:    Nearly all music and film content has now been turned into digital content and is available in some form or shape online. At the core of this revolution is something called ripping – turning analogue film and music into digital files that can be stored on your PC. This  huge  mountain  of  content  is  available  now  for  download  online through either legal, or less than legal, networks. These networks have been designed to be easy to use, especially if you have a computer that can now double as a multimedia machine. Your computer has turned into tomorrow’s entertainment centre.        Millions of users globally are online, downloading content day in, day out. You can either ignore the revolution or start downloading now!  xvii    1  Computer Hardware    1 – Computer Hardware  Before getting started on this chapter, I’d repeat what was said in the preface, which is that those readers impatient to get at the sexy music and video content, might think about skimming this chapter and the next, and go straight to the third chapter on digital music.  Computers constantly need upgrading.  In fact, I’m willing to bet that every year you’ll need to buy either new hard disk space or extra memory. It’s just an annoying fact of  computer  life.   Every few years you’ll also find that you need to buy either a new monitor or even  a  new  motherboard.  As  more  and  more  digital  content  –  music,  film, photos – piles up on your hard drive, the technology you’ll need to process it will need to change.  In this chapter we’ll run through the essential upgrades – and new additions – you’ll need for your computer if you want to get serious about downloading multimedia content.  But  first  it’s  essential  that  you  make  sure  your  current computer is up to a basic spec.   Here’s my current recommended minimum    A 2.6Mhz CPU running Windows XP.   512MB  of  memory  and  200GB  of  hard  disk  space   internally  or    A  17  inch  monitor,  preferably  19  inch  and  for  most  users  a  flat  externally .  screen display.    At least 4 USB 2.0 ports and 2 Firewire slots.   A CD DVD burner, the minimum burn speed should be 4x if not 16x.   Broadband access, with a minimum speed of 1Mbps and no capacity  limits.    A wireless network with broadband access.  If your current system is below that specified in the above box the bad news is that you’ll need to upgrade fast. And, truth be told, even if your machine is bang up-to-date here’s the really bad news: you’ll need some key upgrades at the very least every two years.   3   The Downloader’s Handbook  In this chapter we’ll run through the key upgrades in our thirteen upgrade steps, but here’s a quick, very simple summary.  Upgrade summary  1.  I confidently predict that each and every year you’ll run out of USB and Firewire slots. Every couple of months you’ll buy a whole new bunch of clever  digital  devices  and  they’ll  need  to  be  connected  to  your  PC.  Get ready to buy some form of USB expansion regularly.  2. Memory - you can never have enough. You’ll probably need to double your RAM every year or two. But don’t worry about installing more memory - it’s incredibly easy to do.  3. Hard  disk  space: you  might  choose  to  plumb  in  new  hard  drives  inside your  computer  or  buy  an  external  drive.  Whichever  route  you  go  you’ll probably need to double your total capacity every two years.  It’s a similar story with graphics cards. Want top range games graphics? Want to watch digital TV on your computer? You’ll need a new card every two years!  4.  5. DVD technology is moving so fast that you’ll need a new DVD burner at  least every three years.  6. Every three to four years you’ll probably need to plug a new CPU unit in and probably upgrade your motherboard, although for most people a new computer might be the better option.  4   1 – Computer Hardware  Thirteen upgrade steps Here’s my easy to understand thirteen steps to upgrade heaven!  1. Memory 2. USB and Firewire slots 3. Hard disk storage 4. Motherboard 5. CPU 6. Graphics card 7. TV tuner card or device 8. Operating system 9. Soundcard 10. Home network 11. Streaming 12. Modem and broadband 13. Monitor  Step 1 – Memory  What is memory?  We’ll now look at each of these in more detail.  There are two types of memory associated with computers:    Memory: short-term memory that is lost when the computer is switched off. Storage: long-term memory  e.g. hard disk  where data is retained when the   computer is switched off.   In Step 1, we’re interested in the first type of memory, that is memory that’s used by operating systems and programs to temporarily store data while they are working. The bottom line? More powerful programs generally need more memory  and  that  means  the  average  ordinary  home  computer  memory  will usually take the form of RAM  an integrated circuit memory chip .  5   The Downloader’s Handbook  Why bother upgrading?  Increasing the amount of memory in a computer is one of the best computing investments  you’ll  ever  make.  With  greater  memory,  you  can  run  more applications at one time, make them operate faster, and switch between them instantly.  In  general,  most  current  operating  systems  run  best  with  at  least 128MB of RAM, and preferably 256MB or more to take advantage of the huge range of features the OS has to offer.  However,  before  you  get  too  excited  and  rush  out  and  buy  lots  of  extra memory, you need to check out how many memory slots you have available on your  motherboard –  some  limit  you  to  two,  while  others  provide  up  to  four slots. Also you need to check if your computer requires SDRAM or the next generation – DDR – as the slots for each standard are very different.   Assuming  your  computer  is  reasonably  modern,  you’ll  have  DDR  slots  hopefully at least three of them  and the cost of upgrading should be minimal. Prices are coming down all the time but at the moment you can easily buy a good quality 512MB upgrade for about £35, while a 1GB memory upgrade will probably cost you between £70 and £80.   How much will I need and what make should I buy?  I’ve always bought brand name memory, usually from a big US company called Crucial  www.crucial.com . They’re not the cheapest or necessarily the best, but their  modules  always  work  and  they  are  affordable.  They  also  have  a  great website that  talks  you  through  the  upgrade  process  and  tells  you  what  you need.   Opposite is a table, courtesy of Crucial, with some recommendations for ideal memory size.  6   Table 1.1: Recommended memory  Typical use  Simple computing Some word processing, occasional e-mail  Some business use Word processing and e-mail, spreadsheets, fax and  communication business graphics, general gaming  software, three or more applications open at once   Heavy business use Word processing and e-mail, spreadsheets, fax and  communication software, presentation software,  illustration software, photo editing, Web browser   Gamer and multimedia enthusiast Word processing and e-mail, photo editing, font  packages and multimedia software, CAD software,  CAM software, gaming   Heavy Graphics Design 3-D CAD software, modelling software   Table 1.2: OS Software  XP Pro XP Home Mac OSX Windows 2000 Windows ME 98  128MB 128MB 128MB 128MB 64MB  Software title  Minimum requirements  Crucial recommendations  1 – Computer Hardware  Memory required  256MB  384MB – 512MB  384MB – 512MB  512MB – 1GB  2GB and up  512MB 512MB 256MB 512MB 256MB  7   Software program  Minimum requirements  Crucial recommendations  64MB 256MB 128MB 128MB 128MB 256MB  256MB 384MB 256MB 256MB  128MB 512MB 512MB 512MB 512MB 1024MB +  1024MB 512MB +  512MB +  512MB +   Software title  Minimum requirements  Crucial recommendations  Is it a complicated upgrade?  Upgrading is easy. Total time including opening up the machine: 10 minutes.

And with prices falling all the time it’s not really  worth  buying  much  less  than  an  extra  512MB.  Also,  do remember that most machines support only one type of RAM – with one type of module or connector – so mixing types isn’t an option.   Note: The  absolute  minimum  for  heavy  downloading and  ripping  is  512MB.  Step 2 – USB and Firewire slots  What are these slots?   The idea behind these input output  I O  ports is actually very simple. They can not only power up digital devices attached to them, but also allow these devices to communicate with your computer. Typically, you might connect printers and cameras  to  a  USB   universal  serial  bus   port,  and  external  hard  drives   see section on storage  or video cameras to a Firewire slot.   USB  USB  is  the  most  established  of  the  I O  formats  and  is  standard  on  most machines made after the late 1990s. Older machines  pre-2002  will probably use the first standard  USB 1.1 , while most modern machines will come with the newer standard 2.0. The only difference between these two formats is the speed at which the communications ports can handle data: USB 1.1 pushes data along at between 1 and 12 Mbps while USB 2.0 can handle bursts of up to 480 Mbps. In most other respects these two variations on the USB standard are the same – they can both be used to power some devices and they’re both plug- and-play which  means  that  most  devices  can  simply  be  plugged  in  and Windows  XP  will  recognize  the  device  straight  away. USB  2.0  slots  are  also particularly useful if you intend to add an external hard drive, as the data rate is more than fast enough to transfer music files across from the drive to your computer in a few seconds.  9   The Downloader’s Handbook  Firewire  Firewire  also  known  as  IEEE-1394   is  an  innovative  data  transfer  standard  devised by Apple  for moving big packets of data  typically film and video  between computers, very fast. On paper, its data transfer rate of 400 Mbps has been surpassed by USB 2.0, but talk to most video editors and they say they still use the original Firewire 400 standard. Firewire seems to be able to handle large blocks of big data files particularly well, which makes it the ideal slot for attaching hard drives to.   Why bother upgrading?  More and more of us are buying digital devices – phones, cameras, printers, scanners  –  that  we  want  to  connect  to  a  PC.  These  devices  all  have  a  lead attached to them  although the wireless USB format promises to end this  that needs to be plugged into your computer. Traditionally, PC manufacturers built only 2 USB 1.1 slots onto the motherboard and, if you were lucky, a Firewire slot.   You need at least 4 if not 8 or more USB 2.0 slots attached to your computer, plus maybe another 4 Firewire slots. Think about it: you’ve probably got a USB printer, a scanner, maybe a couple of external hard drives, plus a camera, a video camera, and maybe even a phone that talks to your computer.  Upgrading your USB and Firewire slots  If you need to increase the slots, consider one of two options:  1. You can easily buy PCI slot cards that give you more ports, both of the USB 2.0 and Firewire variety. I’d buy one with at least 4 USB 2.0 slots and 2 Firewire.  2. The  alternative  is  to  daisywheel  off  the  main  USB  slots  and  attach  a bridging device – a USB hub for instance. These typically give you 4 USB slots and some even offer up to 7 USB slots.   If you don’t have either USB or a Firewire  your machine will probably be more than four years old  but it does have a free PCI slot, you can add USB 2.0 and Firewire ports by slotting in a combined USB 2 and Firewire PCI card.   10   1 – Computer Hardware  Tip: Don’t  bother  buying  any  I O  expansion  slot  that  offers  anything below the current USB 2.0. The new USB standard is much better and much faster – and there’s hardly any price difference between USB 1.1 and 2.0. There’s also a new Firewire standard about to hit the high street called Firewire 800 – it’s a faster technology and should also soon become the standard, especially for video and film makers and those with big external storage drives.  Is it a complicated upgrade?  Like a memory upgrade, this is very easy. Simply open up the PC and find a series of white plastic slots in parallel with each other. All you do is insert the PCI card with the USB Firewire slots on it into these slots and that’s it – you’ve upgraded your ports to take more digital devices!   Note: The absolute minimum for heavy downloading and ripping is 4 USB  2 ports and 2 Firewire ports.  Step 3 – Hard disk storage  What is it?  This is the hard disk drive in your system and it’s the long-term memory data centre  of  your  PC.  It’s  here  that  all  your  programs  and  data  are  stored.  But storage can also apply to other ways of storing data including flash drives, tape and removable drives, external hard disks, plus optical storage like CD-ROMs and DVD-RWs. Hard disk drives are almost as amazing as microprocessors in terms of the technology they use and how much progress they have made in terms of capacity, speed and price in the last 20 years. The first PC hard disks had a capacity of 10MB and a cost of over £50 per MB. Modern hard disks have capacities approaching 1,000GB and a cost of less than 20p per MB!   The amount of information a hard drive can store is measured in bytes. You’ll need  all  the  bytes,  and  megabytes,  you  can  lay  your  hands  on,  as  today’s software programs  not to mention data, digital music, photos and multimedia  take up a lot of space.  11   The Downloader’s Handbook  Tip: No matter what kind of storage technology you use, the best idea is to buy the one with the most storage capacity and the quickest access speed.   Lets start with the hard drive.  What do I need?  Most  traditional  hard  drives  built  into  a  PC  use  a  format  called  IDE   or Integrated  Drive  Electronics .  IDE  is  an  interface  for  mass  storage  devices  in which the controller is integrated into the disk or CD-ROM drive.  Newer  storage  systems  use  an  alternative  standard  called  SATA   or  Serial Advanced Technology Attachment . Serial ATAs are more expensive but:        they offer faster data access rates; and  they have smaller footprint leads.   You might also come across something called Raid, which allows data to be spread across different hard disk drives.   If you’re going to store a couple of dozen films plus, say, a hundred albums you will absolutely need a minimum of 80GB in storage. To be honest, most heavy duty downloaders and eager beaver multimedia types wouldn’t touch a hard drive  under  200GB,  and  most  of  them  are  steadily  switching  over  to  SATA drives, which are only slightly more expensive than IDE drives.   Think about attaching external hard drives  External hard drives were traditionally the preserve of big networks and video editing suites – they were used as a way of storing large amounts of data in devices  separate  from,  but  connected  to,  the  main  PC.  The  price  of  external hard drives is falling all the time and at the moment you should be able to pick up a unit with 120GB for well under £100.  External hard drives are a great idea mainly because they can be used as back- up drives. You can keep all your programs on the main hard drive but dump all the important files, like emails or music files, onto a separate external drive, that can be switched off when you’re not using it. These units connect to your hard drive in two ways – either via a USB connection or through the Firewire  12   1 – Computer Hardware  slot. Some better quality units  made by the likes of LaCie and Maxtor  feature both types of connection and if you have the money I’d go for one with 2 USB 2.0 slots and 1 Firewire.   Is it a complicated upgrade?  External hard drives are incredibly easy to hook up to your PC. Simply plug it in, power it up, and that’s it.   Fitting an internal hard drive is a much more complicated exercise. If you do want to upgrade, you should have an open slot inside the computer to which you can connect a hard drive. It’s a fiddly process installing a new hard drive and unless you’ve got some specific and very detailed instructions I wouldn’t bother. If you have no open hard drive IDE connectors to accommodate a new drive, you can install an EIDE adaptor in an empty PCI slot.   Note: The absolute minimum for heavy downloading and ripping is 100GB.  DVD CD   What are optical disk drives?  CD-ROM stands for Compact Disc-Read-Only Memory and, like a DVD, it’s an optical disk capable of storing large amounts of data. The CD-ROM has replaced the floppy disk as the media for software distribution, as it’s storage capacity means  it  could  hold  as  much  data  as  700  floppy  disks.  In  recent  years, rewritable CD-ROMs   called  CD  burners   have  emerged  as  the  new  standard. CD-R drives allow users to record information to a CD  compact disc , providing an easy way to archive data or share files. Additionally, you can choose CD- RW disks that allow you to write data to the CD multiple times. You might also encounter another variation on this technology, notably VCDs – these are video CDs that store video on them and can be played in some DVD machines.  DVD  Digital Versatile Disc  is the latest optical disk technology and can hold a minimum  of  4.7GB  of  data,  enough  for  a  full-length  movie.  DVDs  are commonly used to store films and other multimedia based materials. Similar to CDs, DVDs are rewritable but there are a number of different formats. In the main you’ll encounter two rival formats: DVD-R and DVD+R  these allow you  13   The Downloader’s Handbook  to record to DVD only once , plus the rewritable versions of each of these, DVD- RW or DVD+RW. CD-ROMs are still cheaper, but the price of both DVD burners and the media have collapsed in recent years.   Upgrading your optical technology – why bother?  Optical  storage  technologies  allow  you  to  dump  multimedia content  such  as films and music onto a disc that can eventually be played on a stand-alone CD or DVD player. Also these optical storage technologies allow you to back-up to a ‘physical’ format – you can dump really important files onto something you can tangibly store away for future use.  DVD or CD?  CD-based technology is still cheap; CD burners cost less than £20 and the discs less than 10p. But DVD technology is fast closing in. Good DVD burners from the likes of Sony and LG cost as little as £35 and good quality DVD-Rs by the likes  of  Ritek  cost  less  than  25p  per  disc.  Rewriteable  DVDs  are  still  quite expensive with good quality brands like Memorex and TDK costing above £1 a disk, but these should last you for years. A standard CD can only store around 750MB while a DVD can store around 4.5GB.  But which format DVD should I go for and what speed?  Remember  that  there  are  a  number  of  different  DVD  formats;  ranging  from DVD-R,  and  DVD+R,  through  to  ROM  and  RAM.  Don’t  worry  about  this confusing array of standards. More and more DVD burner manufacturers are producing multi-format drives that’ll work with all formats.   The next issue is what speed your DVD machine will burn discs. CD burners can burn a disc in a few minutes  with 52x speeds  whereas DVD burners are still generally limited to 8x and 16x. Buy the fastest speed DVD burner you can afford.  14   1 – Computer Hardware  Tip: DVD burners will also burn CD media. This is particularly useful if you  want  to  burn  a  CD  of  music  that  will  play  on  a  Hi-Fi.  But remember that you have to have audio format files on the CD, not the main internet music format called MP3  we’ll encounter these formats in a later chapter . Also make sure that the speed stated on the packaging of your optical media – DVD or CD – can be burnt at the speed of your machine. It’s no good having discs that say they can burn at 16x yet your DVD burner can only handle 4x.   Flash memory  solid-state removable storage   What’s a flash drive?  These are in fact what are called solid-state discs, which are high-performance plug-and-play storage devices that contain no moving parts. Most of you will probably  have  encountered  one  form  of  solid-state memory  by  now  –  flash memory, commonly found in digital cameras. Flash memory is small, light and fast. Due to its cost and capacity, however, it is used mainly in laptops, digital cameras, digital audio players, hand-held computers and video game consoles. Flash  memory works  a  lot  like your  computer’s  memory  and,  like your computer’s hard drive, allows you to store data almost instantly.  The formats?  Get ready for a long list. Every year seems to bring a new type of flash memory and most consumers are understandably confused about which one to use. The best thing you can do is to install some kind of multi-format flash card reader; that will have anything between 6 and 21 different little slots built into them which will read all the main formats. They can be installed either as a separate USB plug and play device  that means they don’t need any special software  or you can buy PCI cards that can be fitted into your computer that have multi- card readers built into them.  The  only  real  difference  between  all  the  different  formats  is  size  and  cost. Compact  flash  is  probably  the  biggest  and  cheapest  while  smartmedia  and secure digital cards are smaller and more expensive. You’ll also encounter some flash formats that are tied to particular manufacturers, like Sony – their UMD  15   The Downloader’s Handbook  flash  drives  for  Sony  PSPs  mobile  games  player  and  Memory  Stick  Plus  are both very small and very, very expensive! The capacity of these various formats ranges from 128MB through to 4GB.  Tip: At the absolute minimum make sure you have some way of reading Compact, Secure Digital  SD , SmartMedia and Multimedia  MMC . These are the most popular formats, although XD cards are gaining in popularity as a way of storing digital photos.  You’ll  also  run  into  another  format  called  USB  flash  drives.  These  are  very small, portable flash memory cards that plug straight into a computer’s USB port and functions as a portable hard drive with up to 4GB of storage capacity. USB flash drives are touted as being easy-to-use as they are small enough to be  carried  in  a  pocket  and  can  plug  into  any  computer  with  a  USB  drive, making them an excellent choice for file sharing and for use in small electronic devices. They’re also automatically recognised by Windows XP Plug and Play system and so don’t need any extra software.   Step 4 – Motherboard  What is it?  This  is  the  heart  of  your  PC.  It  handles  system  resources  as  well  as  core components  like the  CPU,  and  all  system  memory.  It  also  accepts  expansion devices such as sound and network cards, and modems.   Is it worth upgrading?  Unless your computer is more than five years old, the answer is probably not. If it is slightly older and a little slow, upgrading your motherboard could be worth it. A new motherboard will:         allow you to use more or faster memory; support a faster graphics card; support the latest disc technologies like serial ATA or SATA hard drives  16   1 – Computer Hardware        enable you to make extensive use of peripherals that use USB2.0 and the latest Firewire standards; and increase your expansion slot potential.   Tip:  If  your  system  uses  a  motherboard called  Baby  AT  –  dominant between  1993  and  1997  –  you  probably  should  upgrade  to  the newer ATX standard. This will make your computer work faster, and allow more USB and Firewire connections to be added.  What should I go for?  Most users like the bigger desktop and tower cases that are designed to use a standard  ATX  size  motherboard,  but  more  and  more  consumers  are  opting instead  for  small  footprint  computers   you’ll  also  need  a  new  case ,  and  for these you’ll require something called MidiATX or MicroATX designs.  What will it cost me?  Motherboard prices  range  from  around  £35  to  over  £400  depending  on  the features. Choosing the right board will dictate the type of processor you can use, how well the other components communicate, the features on offer and future  upgrade  potential.  Cheaper  boards  can  save  you  money  but  will  limit processor support, graphics and expansion options. Spending around £70-£100 will get you a good mix of features and the latest technologies.  Is it a complicated upgrade?  It’s  a  fairly  complicated  upgrade,  which  will  probably  end  up  with  you replacing the case and all the other components as well. Unless you’re really determined, I wouldn’t bother – just buy a newer, cheap computer.   Step 5 – CPU  What is it?  The CPU  or central processing unit or processor  is the brains of your PC, as everything  that  happens  inside  your  PC  has  to  interact  with  it.  It  processes instructions, manages the flow of information through a computer system, and  17   The Downloader’s Handbook  performs  millions  of  calculations  every  second.  The  faster  the  processor   the higher the number of GHz , the more efficiently your computer will perform.  Is it worth upgrading?  If you’re a big gamer or do a lot of demanding video and graphics work, you’ll almost  certainly  benefit  from  the  latest  CPU –  especially  those  with  large amounts of L2 cache and fast FSB speeds.   What kind of upgrade should I go for?  There’s  a  bewildering  number  of  processors  out  there  for  all  budgets,  with prices from £25 for low-end CPUs up to £700 for the very latest and fastest speed  beasts!  If  you  regularly  have  lots  of  applications  running  at  the  same time,  you  will  particularly  see  the  benefit  of  Intel’s  Hyper-Threading technology. One of the biggest decisions centres on which brand to go for…  Intel vs AMD?  Intel’s Pentium 4 processors are very much the market leader at the moment. But more and more people are opting for the 64-bit capability of chips made by a company called AMD, although the fact that it’s the underdog in a global battle  and  its  lower  prices  might  have  something  to  do  with  its  growing popularity. Which particular type of product to go for though?    While the cheaper Celeron or Duron ranges are absolutely fine for general tasks, if you are doing an awful lot of downloading, and starting to play a lot of music and video, it’s basically a question of Intel’s Pentium 4 versus AMD’s Athlon XP and Athlon 64. The chief difference between these is that the Pentium 4 and Athlon XP are 32-bit CPUs while the Athlon 64 is a 64- bit model  we’ll talk about all this 64-bit technology below .     Dedicated  gamers  looking  for  speed  and  future  performance  improvements should choose one of the Athlon 64 chips. But be warned – they’re currently very  expensive!  For  heavy  users  with  demanding  tastes,  Intel  has  also  just launched a new ranges of processors, called Extreme Editions. AMD has reacted by introducing its own Athlon 64 FX range, a high-end gaming workstation CPU; this  amazingly  powerful  CPU can  deal  with  one  terabyte  of  RAM  1,000GB . Really demanding games require an awful lot of processing power and are designed to run more efficiently on a 64-bit platform.  18   1 – Computer Hardware  Tip:  If you do decide to go for a very powerful CPU from Intel, go for the ‘Prescott’ models.   What’s all this about the next generation of 64-bit processors?  It’s all about the way data is transferred. The P4 generation  still dominant  of CPUs rely on something called the motherboard chipset to shuttle data between processor  and  memory,  whereas  the   Athlon   64s  avoid  this  bottleneck  by integrating the memory controller onto the CPU itself. In simple language, that means these 64-bit chipsets allow you to work much faster with really data- heavy applications like graphics processing or video.  But you’ll also need loads of memory  see below  and you’ll also need to use software  that  has  been  specially  designed  to  work  using  this  technical architecture. Oh yes, and you’ll also need a 64-bit OS to take advantage of this. As  I  write  this,  the  technical  jury  is  out  on  whether  its  really  that  great  a technological leap but for the vast majority of users, it’s not worth the bother at the moment.  Hyper-Threading – what on earth is this?  Most of Intel’s current Pentium 4s and some of the Mobile Pentium 4s support something called Hyper-Threading  HT . Put simply, HT gives you two virtual processors for the price of one, which will give you a noticeable performance boost by allowing applications to use either or both of the two virtual CPUs, hence  making  the  system  much  more  responsive  when  running  lots  of applications at the same time. It’s not quite as good as running a system with dual CPUs  as Apple does , but it’s a lot cheaper.  Which clock speed to go for?        If you use your computer for a limited amount of internet browsing, a small bit of music and plenty of word processing you could get away with using a CPU with a speed of as little as 500 MHz, although I’d recommend at least 800 MHz for better performance.  If you’re a more serious gamer who likes 2D games like strategy games, you’ll definitely want a CPU speed of at least 1.6 GHz. The faster your CPU,  19   The Downloader’s Handbook     the better your PCs performance, especially for more advanced 3D gaming. This level is also for most average multimedia users and downloaders. If you’re a hardcore gamer playing loads of top notch 3D games, or you edit loads of video or use your computer to make music, you’ll want the fastest CPU you can reasonably afford, with a minimum of 2.4 GHz.  Is it a complicated upgrade?  On paper, the upgrade is easy. You simply open up the unit, whip out the old unit and put a new one in. In practice, it’s a bit more complicated than that. You might have to upgrade the BIOS operating system – the software that lies beneath  your  Microsoft  system.  Unless  you’re  willing  to  spend  a  bit  of  time preparing for the installation I wouldn’t bother doing it yourself.   A good website that talks you through the whole process in enormous detail is http:  users.erols.com chare cpu_gen.htm.  Tip: Don’t  ever  buy  a  CPU upgrade  unless  the  new  processor  runs  at least  twice  as  fast  as  your  current  one.  And  if  you’re  at  all squeamish about opening your PCs case and pulling out parts, it’s probably best to leave your chip alone. Also, increasing the amount of memory you have can also do as much to improve speeds as a CPU upgrade.  Step 6 – Graphics card  What is it?  A graphics card is a small circuit board  smaller than the main motherboard to which  it’s  fitted   that  contains  the  necessary  video  memory  to  bring  your favourite programs, games and even video editing to life.  There are different types of graphic cards on the market – which one should you go for?  There’s a huge range of models and types but they basically fall into one of three categories:   20   1 – Computer Hardware  1. Gamer video cards  These  are  the  fastest  and  most  expensive  and  pretty  much  essential  if you’re a keen video editor or into games like Half Life 2 or Doom 3. These usually cost at least a few hundred pounds.  2. Mass market video cards  These  are  fine  for  most  ordinary  videos  and  games,  are  usually  sold  as something  called  AGP  cards  and  they’re  at  least  8  times  as  fast  as  a standard PCI card. They might also come as PCI Express  also known as PCI Express x16 , which is the newest slot type and is as much as four times as fast  as  the  fastest  AGP  slot.  From  2006  this  should  pretty  much  be  the standard for most new computers. It’s also worth noting that a PCI Express video card will not fit into a PCI slot and vice-versa. Almost all PCs have PCI  slots,  whereas  most  PCI  Express  slots  are  found  only  on  newer machines.  3. Value video cards  These are for simple 2D games, basic video and music playback and more mundane  business  applications  like  spreadsheets  or  PowerPoint  slides. These usually come as standard on cheaper PCs, but if you do need to buy one  they  should  cost  less  than  £100.  These  usually  come  as  PCI  cards  – these slots are built into the motherboard and you can easily slot the PCI card in.   Any extra Features to look out for?     S-video and or TV-out: Most video cards, even value cards, provide the ability  to  send  the  video  signal  from  your  PC  to  a  TV.  This  is  usually labelled as ‘TV-out’ and in most cases it’s actually a connection called ‘S- video’  you’ll also see these on DVD and VHS players .    Dual monitor support is also very useful for really powerful multimedia applications  like video  editing.  Dual  monitor  support  simply  means  that you split the video signal to go across two monitors instead of one. Most film and TV editors use this dual monitor system because it’s easier on the eye, and allows them to run multiple applications at once. Usually the dual monitor support consists of one standard VGA output  standard computer monitor  and one DVI jack  see overleaf .   21   The Downloader’s Handbook  Tip: If you intend to upgrade to an LCD monitor, you will need a graphics card with a DVI output port, as it will produce better image quality. DVI is a higher definition output, used with some newer monitors as well as some high-end TVs. If your monitor or TV supports DVI, using this jack will give you a better picture than the standard VGA or RCA  TV-out  output.   What’s all this about the rivalry between ATI and nVidia?  The really important bit of a graphics card is the GPU or graphics processing unit.  This  is  the  clever  bit  that  translates  all  the  data  into  stunning  visual images. And as with CPUs there are two dominant competitors: ATI and nVidia in  this  case.  The  truth  is  that  both  have  made  great  products  with  nVidia  GeForce  traditionally viewed as the technical champ, but in recent years ATI’s Radeon products have shot ahead.   Why bother upgrading?  If you are serious about using a lot more multimedia applications such as video editing,  or  imagine  running  more  and  more  multimedia files  over  a  home network, you should seriously consider upgrading your graphics card to at least the AGP standard. But beware: if you have a cheap motherboard it may have what’s called an integrated graphics chip built-in instead of a proper, separate AGP graphics card. If your machine doesn’t have an empty AGP slot but does have  an  open  PCI  slot,  you  may  be  able  to  add  a  PCI-based  graphics  card instead.   Is it a complicated upgrade?  The simple answer is: yes, in most circumstances. If your PC has an empty AGP slot, you can probably upgrade your graphics without difficulty; though if you have an integrated graphics board you may need to disable the system’s on- board  graphics  chip  in  your  PC  setup  program.  PCI  graphics  cards  are incredibly easy to fit.   22   1 – Computer Hardware  Step 7 – TV tuner card or device  What is it?  It’s  a  special  kind  of  graphics  card that  allows  your  computer  to  receive  TV signals, even digital TV signals, plus radio. It’ll come with a slot to attach to your home aerial or its own small aerial. It will also  hopefully  have software that comes with it that will allow you to tune the TV signal, and even control recording of the TV programmes. These cards  or boxes  also frequently have inputs built into them that allow you to play MiniDV tapes and then convert them to data files. The price of these cards vary enormously, depending on the features  see below , but as a guide you’ll probably end up spending around £50 for  a  cheap  TV  tuner  through  to  £150  for  an  all  singing  all  dancing  Digital TV DAB external tuner.  Any extra features to look out for?  The  big  feature  to  look  out  for  is  access  to  digital  TV.  If  you  plan  to  watch terrestrial broadcasts, a digital tuner compatible with Freeview will offer the best channel choice, picture and sound. Beware – in my experience reception can  vary  enormously  and  you  may  well  need  an  extra  indoor  receiver specifically  for  the  PC.  Some  tuners  can  also  receive  radio  as  well  as  TV broadcasts, but again beware – a digital tuner doesn’t always mean you’ll get Digital  Audio  Broadcasting  DAB   signals,  which  is  a  completely  separate standard to simple digital radio. Also look out for Teletext and subtitle support.  Why bother upgrading?  1. There are a huge number of digital TV channels available with some great content – and they’re all free. If you have a reasonably powerful computer with plenty of hard disk space you can, with the right software, record TV programmes  and  films  and  then  store  them  on  your  computer  for  later playback.  Digital  tuners  record  signals  straight  to  disk  for  maximum quality,  while  analogue signals  need  to  be  digitally  encoded.  The  best analogue products offer MPEG-2 hardware for real-time video and audio encoding,  but  cheaper  options  rely  on  the  PCs  processor  to  do  this  in software.  23   The Downloader’s Handbook  2. Most  analogue systems  also  allow  you  to  capture  video  from  a  VCR  or camcorder. Look for composite or higher-quality S-video connectors and stereo phono inputs. A good tuner can record material in Pal, NTSC and SECAM video formats. While quality can usually be adjusted, an hour of MPEG-2 video swallows up between 1GB and 2GB of disk space.  Is it a complicated upgrade?  Internal TV tuners require a free PCI slot, so you’ll need to open your PC to install it but that shouldn’t be too difficult. External options are much easier to set up, as they connect via a spare USB port, which is good for notebooks as well as desktop PCs.   Tip: Although  most  are  backwards  compatible  with  USB1.1,  a  high- speed USB2.0 connection is often needed to use advanced features. Today’s devices typically require Windows ME, 2000 or XP. Check specifically for Windows 98 or NT support.  Extra tip on the “EPGs” that come with these cards: These are Electronic  Programme  Guides  and  they  are  software-based applications that tell your computer which programmes are due to broadcast. They also allow you to use your computer like a video recorder, setting up record times later in the day week month. But not all EPGs are created equal – some have primitive information and very few intuitive features. DigiGuide by contrast is top notch and worth paying less than £10 a year to access.  Step 8 – Operating system  What is it?  It’s the software system that runs your computer and all the devices attached to it. In reality for most of us these OSs as they’re called – operating systems – are made by Microsoft. This book is written for those of you with XP although Windows Millennium Edition  ME  is perfectly acceptable and should be able to  handle  most  multimedia tasks  talked  about  in  this  book.  But  ME  is increasingly  looking  outdated  and  more  and  more  software  and  new  digital multimedia technology is specifically developed for XP.  24   1 – Computer Hardware  If you have Windows 98, I’d upgrade fast. It’s a perfectly acceptable system for bare bones systems that simply run a word processor along with the odd bit of email checking; but for data rich multimedia material and heavy downloading it’s fast becoming useless. It’s also worth saying that Microsoft has withdrawn live technical support for Windows 98.  You can also use a Linux OS but I wouldn’t really bother unless you’re willing to  learn  Linux  code  and  feel  fairly  technically  competent.  It’s  cheap,  it’s resilient, it’s open source and it’s less vulnerable to security attacks by malware, but it’s complicated and difficult to use. Apple make great computers and their Tiger OS is a wonderful piece of technology, but this book is explicitly written for Microsoft users – sorry!  Tip:  If you haven’t already done so, upgrade to XP now!  Is it a complicated upgrade?  Upgrading your OS from, say, Windows 98 to XP should be very easy. But there may be a few problems. First check that your computer has enough memory inside it to run XP – usually you’ll need an absolute minimum of 128MB and practically  256MB.  Also  make  sure  that  the  programs  you’re  running  on Windows 98 can be upgraded to XP – you may need to update the software. Upgrading from Millennium is very easy.  Note: The  absolute  minimum  for  heavy  downloading and  ripping  is  Windows XP.  Step 9 – Sound card  What is it?  These  days  almost  all  PCs  come  with  a  sound  card or  sound  chip  –  the technology  that  permits  you  to  hear  sound  from  your  PC.  Your  sound  card affects the quality of every sound your computer makes, whether it’s a simple beeping  noise  or  the  music  of  a  CD  being  played  in  your  CD-ROM  drive. Unfortunately there can be a noticeable difference in the quality of sound cards  25   The Downloader’s Handbook  and many music fans choose to upgrade to a high-quality sound card, or to bypass their existing sound card using a USB audio adaptor.  Why bother upgrading?  A sound  card should  be  fitted  as  standard,  usually  cheap  ones!  That’s  not necessarily a bad thing if you just use your PC for computing and downloading. If, on the other hand, you sit in front of your PC a lot and play music and watch film,  you  might  need,  something  better.  While  some  top  range  sound  cards  they’re  built  into  the  motherboard   will  support  six-channel   5.1   surround sound  two front, one centre, two rear speakers and a subwoofer , a dedicated sound card is always going to do a better job of bringing your favourite movies and games to life.        If you’re a movie buff, you’ll need surround sound to play your DVDs and most add-on cards should fit the bill. Technical standards to look out for: a 24-bit card is probably the way to go for DVD movies sporting newer THX surround or Dolby Digital EX 6.1 or 7.1 sound formats.  If  you  are  into  creating  music then  you  may  want  to  start  with  cards offering  24-bit  48KHz  or  96KHz  sampling  quality  with  internal  cards starting at around £60. The key make to look for in higher end cards is Creative and its Sound Blaster range.  Internal PCI cards are the cheapest option with some manufacturers offering respectable set ups for less than £20, although good makes like Creative will probably charge closer to £30. You can also buy external sound cards – these are easier to fit, typically sound better and have many more input and output slots. Entry level USB sound cards will cost around £35, but expect to pay £60- £80 for a decent 24-bit USB card.  Tip: Look out for sound cards with something called S PDIF in and out. S PDIF stands for Sony Philips Digital Interface, an audio transfer format that means you can connect speakers via a single optical or coaxial cable and enjoy much higher quality digital sound.  Is it a complicated upgrade?  Fitting an external sound card is incredibly easy – seconds rather than minutes. Fitting a new PCI-based card is a little more fiddly – you have to open up the machine as you would installing extra memory – but it’s easy to do.  26   1 – Computer Hardware  Step 10 – Home network  What is it?  Lets say you have three computers at home – one main desktop, a smaller older machine  for  the  kids  and  a  laptop.  Unless  you  establish  some  kind  of  home network, these computers will not be able to talk to each other. And that means that  the  only  way  of  transferring  files  between  these  computers  is  via  some kind of disk swapping – floppy, flash or removable external hard drive. A home network of some form does away with this lack of connectivity plus you buy into a bunch of other big pluses!  1. The home network allows all the computers on the network to share files  2.  and potentially share printers. It allows the computers to all access the internet through one machine – called Internet Connection Sharing or ICS – or through a special router.  3. You  can  also  run  other  networked  devices  off  the  network  such  as streaming music and video players and even external hard drives that can be used by all computers on the network  How to build a network  There are two ways of building a network:   1. The first, and most traditional way, is by wiring them all using a technical standard called Ethernet which utilises 10 100 ethernet plugs and slots. It’s fast, it’s relatively secure and it works. But it involves lots of wiring and most home users tend to opt for the more expensive alternative.  2. Wireless networks use one of a number of technical standards to keep all the computers networked. These different formats – most of them grouped around  something  called  Wi-Fi –  all  vary  in  the  rate  at  which  they  can transfer data and their likely costs. As with virtually everything in techno- land, the bottom line is that the faster the system, the more expensive the solution.   Whatever technology you use, all the devices on a network will operate in one of two modes: infrastructure and ad-hoc.  In infrastructure mode, all network devices talk to each other through what’s called  a  central  ‘Access  Point’.  This  access  point  grants  permission  to  each  27   The Downloader’s Handbook  device, determines the frequency to communicate on, and relays data between network  adaptors.  Access  points  are  stand-alone  devices  that  can  ‘bridge’ wireless computers to wired ethernet computers. They also may be built into other devices like network routers, which in turn manage the connection to the internet.  Ad-hoc  networks  are  easier  to  configure  and  only  involve  you  in hooking up two Wi-Fi adapters, which then talk to each other on a peer-to-peer basis.  Which format?       Up  to  fairly  recently  the  main  standard  has  been  something  inelegantly called 802.11b. This format transfers data between computers at a data rate of 11Mbps  this is the absolute maximum  and its great advantage is that its become a de facto world standard. 802.11a is a newer format and supports a maximum 54Mbps data rate and is  fast  becoming  the  de  facto  standard  in  some  parts  of  the  world.  As  a format  it  also  has  a  number  of  advantages;  it  doesn’t  suffer  from interference from Bluetooth devices like mobile phones and the data rate is easily  fast  enough  to  support  streaming multimedia like  film.  Its  big disadvantage is that it isn’t approved for use in Europe! 802.11g is fast emerging as the ‘next thing’ in Wi-Fi and also offers data transmission  rates  of  up  to  54Mbps,  but  unlike the  ‘a’  standard  it’s backwards compatible with 802.11b – that means you won’t have to junk all your old ‘b’ standard gear when you move up to ‘g’. Its downside is that it’s more expensive and only tends to work over shorter ranges.      What to go for?  If you’re after a cheap wireless network with a wide range, go for 802.11b. But be  aware  that  it  can  suffer  from  interference  from  other  electronic  devices  especially some cordless phones  and its data transfer rate will not handle any video streaming or extremely fast file transfer. If none of this bothers you the very cheapest option – at a cost of under £100 – is through two simple Wi-Fi cards or USB plug in devices. All you need do then is set up ICS or internet connection sharing, and you can then connect both of your computers to the internet.  28   1 – Computer Hardware  If you want to connect up more than two computers you’ll need an access point plus some adapters. At the moment it also makes sense to include a router in the black box if you can, as this can then handle all your internet connections. This raises the cost considerably – more than £200 for a network – and is also quite technically challenging, but is worth it if you want to build a robust and secure home network. Remember that routers also typically include some form of hardware firewall  see the next chapter on securing your computer  adding an extra level of security to your network.  Tip:  If you think there’s going to be an awful lot of data traffic going over the network, especially if you have streaming devices that will handle video, you should go for a 802.11g network, preferably one with a router access point. It’s the most expensive option – it’ll cost at least £100 – but it’ll be technologically robust and should be able to handle all types of files including big film files.

A ‘D’ means short distances, an ‘A’ means almost any home would be covered without additional equipment. Cost: A is the least expensive.      29   The Downloader’s Handbook  Is it a complicated upgrade?  Plugging in a couple of Wi-Fi adapters and installing the software for these adapters isn’t difficult. Setting up the network and getting all the machines to talk to each other is considerably more challenging.  Windows  XP,  especially  after  the  Service  Pack  2  upgrade,  does  have  some excellent  wizards  that  help  you  set  up  a  home  network.  These  are  a  little complicated but worth the effort and shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes to set up. Unfortunately you may also have to fiddle around with any firewalls you  introduce  onto  the  network  –  see  the  next  chapter  on  securing  your computer. The firewall has to be told to let your computer communicate with the other computer – this should be easy but frequently isn’t.  Building  a  proper  network  based  around  a  router  is  considerably  more challenging and I wouldn’t recommend this option except if you really mug up on  the  subject  and  are  willing  to  spend  a  few  hours  fiddling  around  with network  settings.  Luckily,  because  most  router  access  points  involve  a broadband connection  see below , they are usually installed by a friendly BT engineer who will do most of the fiddly stuff for you.   Step 11 – Streaming  What is it?  Streaming allows you to access music, videos and photos stored on your PC using a device which is in a different room – the device is plugged into your TV and Hi-Fi and has a remote control, just like a DVD player. It doesn’t need to  copy  or  store  the  files,  as  they’re  played  or  streamed  over  the  network connection as and when you need them.  Why bother?  You could of course put a PC in your living room but for the vast majority of us there’s neither the space nor the money to spend on this kind of media centre system.  Streaming devices  by  contrast  are  a  wonderful  addition  –  I  have  a Netgear music player that sits next to the Hi-Fi and plays all of the 5,000 tracks that sit on my external hard drive. It’s one of a number of sub £100 devices that lets you turn your PC into a jukebox that can be played in the living room.  30   1 – Computer Hardware  The big downside with this technology is that it’s quite fiddly to install – the operating  software  is  fairly  straightforward,  but  getting  the  device  past  a firewall can be extremely tricky. If you decide to go for a streaming device that also plays video, like the Pinnacle ShowCenter, you face an additional problem – many of the formats you’ve used to compress your films may not instantly play over the wireless network. Still, when these video streaming devices work, they are a miracle to behold – a video jukebox on your TV!  Step 12 – Modem and broadband  What is it?  A modem is a device that allows your computer to communicate with another computer over a phone line. You need a modem to access the internet. Most notebooks and desktops today come with an internal modem.   Is it a complicated upgrade?  Simple modems are easy to upgrade. If you want to upgrade, simply open up the computer box, unscrew the PCI card holding the modem in and install a new PCI modem card. It should take less than five minutes in all. You can also buy modems that connect to your computer through a USB port – these are trivially easy to install and should take less than a minute.   Which kind of modem?  Most traditional modems connect to the internet at a speed of 56K – this is the rate  of  data  transfer  between  computers,  and  means  that  your  connection allows up to 56 kilobytes of information to be transferred per second. Until just a few years ago this was seen as the standard, but now broadband speeds are the standard.   If you want to download lots of content off the internet, a broadband modem and connection is pretty much essential and DSL  or Digital Subscriber Line , is the most popular way of accessing the internet. It’s faster, cheaper and to get it you don’t need to install a special phone line.   You  do,  however  need  a  special  modem.  DSL modems  connect  at  any  rate starting at 128Kbps right through to 40Mbps. It works by splitting your existing  31   The Downloader’s Handbook  copper telephone line signal into two: one for voice and the other for data. But it only works if you’re relatively close to the local telephone exchange – you usually  have  to  be  within  four  miles  of  an  ADSL  enabled  exchange  and  the telephone local loop has to be capable of being upgraded. Initially ADSL speeds were set at about 512Kbps but recent technical upgrades have seen that mass market standard rise to a fast 2Mbps. Operators are also experimenting with services  using technology called VDSL  that provides speeds of between 4 and 16 Mbps.   What kind of equipment will I need for ADSL broadband?  The cheapest way to get online is using a PCI DSL modem card, with prices below £40. The downside is that it requires a fair bit of knowledge of how to install  into  your  computer  and  also  consumes  a  lot  of  your  CPU cycle  to operate, but it does deliver the best response times  gamers take note! .  A USB ADSL Modem is the easiest way to connect to a broadband network and should  cost  well  under  £100.  It  should  simply  be  a  matter  of  plugging  in, installing the drivers and switching on.   More experienced users might want to consider an ethernet wireless router, which is a stand alone device that maintains the connection to the internet for you. Most routers have an Ethernet connection to your local area network and act as a gateway, DNS, DHCP and firewall service.   Table 1.6: ADSL speeds  ADSL speed  Typical download  Typical upload  512Kbps 1Mbps 2Mbps  460 Kbps 920 Kbps 1840 Kbps  220-260 Kbps 220-260 Kbps 220-260 Kbps  Cable  modems also  allow  users  to  access  the  internet  via  the  same  coaxial cable that brings cable television into their homes. This option is only available in some  parts  of  the  UK,  but  it  has  numerous  advantages  if  it  is  available, notably:  1.  It’s usually cheaper than ADSL. With most DSL broadband packages you’re looking at paying around £20 a month just for the broadband service, plus  32   1 – Computer Hardware  2.  3.  extra for phone calls. Cable networks frequently provide broadband access, all phone calls and basic cable TV for between £30 and £50 a month. It’s faster. Cable operators tend to upgrade their networks quicker than BT  except that is for NTL in south London which has a lamentable technical record  to  date .  So  while  BT  has  now  upgraded  its  network  to  2Mbps, operators  such  as  Telewest  are  busily  moving  up  to  4  and  then  8  Mbps. There is one drawback though – if local traffic is heavy, speeds can fall back quite considerably, sometimes falling well below 1Mbps. It’s easier to install. A nice engineer comes and visits and installs a black box somewhere in your house, switches it all on, connects it to your TV and computer and then leaves you alone.   Speeds  Typical rate speeds vary depending on your type of internet connection. Dial- up users can get up to 54Kbps, but in practice typical connections are in the 40Kbps  range.  Cable  modem  users  can  expect  anywhere  from  1,000  to 3,000Kbps  while  DSL users  typically  get  between  256Kbps  to  2,000Kbps, depending on the access package purchased.   OK, regardless of which kind of network to use, what speed do I need?  You  can  never  have  enough  broadband!  If  I  were  to  switch  into  telecoms engineer talk, you could say that a 2Mbps connection will be up to 40 times faster  than  an  old  fashioned  dial-up connection.  But  notice  that  up  to. The speed your files transfer across the internet depends on many factors.  First off, some networks connect faster to the internet than others. But there’s more. The internet itself is sometimes slower, sometimes faster – log on when the US logs on and internet speeds accessing websites will probably fall. And if your site is popular the speed at which you’ll access it will also vary.   But back to the original question – how much speed do I need?   Most users will be perfectly happy with 2Mbps and I’d only really recommend going  above  this  if  you  use  downloading services  like  file  sharing  networks each  and  every  day.  If  you  do,  you  should  be  careful  about  any  monthly download caps – these tend to be set at around the 2Gb level. A 2Gb cap will not last long if you download emails every day and maybe a couple of movies a month plus music. Pay extra and get that download cap removed!  33   The Downloader’s Handbook  Table 1.7: Internet speeds  User  Occasional internet user who only  looks at a few pages a week, and  checks their email intermittently   Broadband speed  128 to 512Kbps  Likely cost per  month  £   Under £15 a month although becoming increasingly difficult to find  £20 a month  Frequent emails, a lot of web pages  512Kbps to 1Mbps Between £15 and and the odd photo moved across  the internet Regular internet user but only  limited downloads Very regular internet user, many  with heavy attachments and some  downloading Very heavy downloaders   Between £15 and £25 a month Between £20 and £30 a month  2Mbps to 8Mbps  2Mbps to 4Mbps  1Mbps to 2Mbps  Between £25 and  £35 a month  Streaming TV and radio over the  internet – the cable TV experience  but using the internet  2Mbps to 10Mbps  Between £25 and  upper end for high £45 a month definition TV   Step 13 – Monitor  TFT versus CRT?  Good old fashioned cathode ray tube monitors  CRT  seem to have gone rather out  of  fashion  in  recent  years,  mainly  because  sexy  looking  flat  screen monitors based on the TFT standard have crashed in price, but CRT technology is very robust and still has a lot of strengths. Yes, CRTs are bulky, heavy and consume  a  lot  more  power  than  TFTs,  but  they  are  cheap  and  they  have  an excellent  reputation  for  reliability.  It’s  also  worth  noting  that  CRT  monitors usually  have  a  higher  resolution  than  a  TFT  of  the  same  size,  and  work perfectly at any standard resolution up to the quoted maximum. Running a TFT below its native resolution  the number of pixels in the TFT  can result in either a very poor ‘blocky’ picture, or one that doesn’t fill the whole screen.  34   1 – Computer Hardware  CRT monitors  If you are going to go for a CRT monitor make sure it’s one of the flat-screen models, which are much more pleasant to use than the old curved-screen ones. Most users will be happy with a 17in or 19in CRT, although larger sizes  21in and  beyond   are  popular  for  graphics-intensive  work  such  as  desktop publishing or photo editing.  Tip: Ensure there’s a smoothly operating tilt-and-swivel base fitted. A CRT should support at least an 85Hz refresh rate for any resolution you  use  to  avoid  flicker  in  the  image.  Cheap  models  might  not achieve  this  at  their  maximum  resolution.  Check  the  data  sheets closely. One of the most important standards for CRTs is the TCO label.  This  guarantees  compliance  with  stringent  electromagnetic emissions,  ergonomics,  energy  saving  and  environmental requirements.   TFT monitors  TFT monitors are immensely popular and falling in price all the time. Decent 15in TFTs should cost less than £150 these days and some cheap 17in models are starting to fall below £120! In my experience anything below 17in is too small and the average is increasingly moving up to 19in as prices collapse. TFTs great advantage is that they’re smaller, take up less room and look more stylish than CRT monitors.  You  might  also  want  to  consider  investing  in  a  TFT  monitor  that  can  also double as a computer monitor. These have separate switchable TV tuners and PC inputs and they allow you to use the monitor for both purposes – they’re still expensive, but if you’re limited for space and you’re looking for a really stylish looking unit, LCD TVs could be just right for you.   Tip: Gamers  wanting  to  run  1,600  x  1,200  will  probably  need  an expensive 20in model – 19in panels are currently limited to 1,280 x 1,024, and budget 15in models might only support 800 x 600.  35   The Downloader’s Handbook  In  this  chapter  we  looked  at  the  minimum  hardware  requirements  for  a computer to play music and video. We also looked at what steps to take if your equipment needs upgrading. In the next chapter we’ll look at the steps you need to take to make sure that, when you go on the internet, your computer is secure.   36   2  Securing Your Computer  Be afraid, be very afraid...    2 – Securing Your Computer  No-one  can  hear  you  scream  in  cyberspace  when  your  computer  has  been infected with a deadly virus. You can’t cry on anyone’s shoulder. And even if you have paid mega bucks for a fancy technical support line, they’ll probably tell you to format your computer hard drive and start again from scratch.   And don’t for one minute underestimate the challenge that’s about to face your computer as you start downloading music and film – you are about to send your  computer  into  potentially  uncharted  territory  where  viruses  and  nasty malware  a generic description for all sorts of bad stuff, malicious software  are endemic.   Let’s  get  specific:  going  online  and  downloading  content  from  the  big  file sharing  networks is  absurdly  dangerous,  unless  you  have  all the  following essentials:  1. a regularly updated anti-virus program; 2. a firewall, ideally at the hardware level plus one software based; and 3. at least two if not three strong anti-spyware programs.  If you’ve already got all these defences loaded up and ready for action, you’re probably safe and secure – you can probably skip to the next chapter and start working with music. If not, read on!  In this chapter we’ll walk you through a five step security plan that should save you future heartache and endless re-formatting. In this chapter you’ll learn how to:  1. Make sure your operating system software is kept up-to-date. 2. Spot the enemy and understand the different types of malware. 3. Download anti-virus software. 4. Use  not  one  but  three  great  anti-spyware  programs  in  combination  as  a  triple dose spyware killer.  5. Work with hardware firewalls, ignore the Windows firewall and install the  very best free firewall on the market, ZoneAlarm.  39   The Downloader’s Handbook  Five steps to safe downloading  Step 1 – Update your software Operating systems, and especially Windows XP, have come a long way since the  advent  of  ‘always-on,  always  connected’  broadband.  XP  has  an  in-built ‘Update’ routine that will automatically update your computer and protect you against  any  security  weaknesses.  These  updates  are  not  without  their  critics  who charge that some of the updates have made PCs even more unstable , but the  protection  these  fixes  provide  from  known  ‘nasties’   like  the  infamous Blaster virus that struck in the summer of 2003  is worth the risk.

You can get the Service Pack 2 update as one very big download from the main Microsoft website, but in my experience it’s a better idea to order one of their free update CDs. It’ll take about two weeks to come out to you by post but it’s worth having a hard copy of this huge update. The update is packed with loads of useful features but the best is the Security Center. This will install a much  40   2 – Securing Your Computer  more  proficient   but  far  from  comprehensive   firewall,  and  it  will  make  sure that  any  security  software  you’re  running  is  automatically  detected  and updated.  It  will  also  control  the  way  that  you  continuously  update  the  XP operating system.  If you’ve not already done so, enable automatic updates in Windows XP with Service  Pack  2.  Right-click  ‘My  Computer’,  click  ‘Properties’,  ‘Automatic Updates’, select Automatic  recommended , set a time for the updates  or accept the default , and click ‘OK’.  Windows isn’t the only place where automatic updates can save your bacon. Most  antivirus  programs  also  update  automatically  –  all  you  have  to  do  is provide  an  internet  connection  and  keep  automatic  updates  enabled  in  the program. Firewalls, too, occasionally suffer from flaws and exploits that require regular patching. ZoneAlarm firewall software usually notifies users when such an  update  is  available.  And  at  least  one  browser  –  the  Mozilla  Foundation’s Firefox – notifies you of available updates. Other programs require that you check for updates manually via a menu command, or by checking the vendor’s website for a patch or a new version.  n o i t a r o p r o C  t f o s o r c i M m o r f  n o i s s i m r e p  h t i  w d e t n i r p e r  t o h s  n e e r c s  t c u d o r p  t f o s o r c i M   41   The Downloader’s Handbook  Step 2 – Know the enemy Even experienced internet users get downright lazy when it comes to security. They think they can just load themselves up with all the right programs, sit back  and  ignore  the  threat  –  the  computer  software  will  do  everything  for them! In my experience this is a hugely short-sighted strategy. I think it’s worth getting to know the enemy via a judicious scan of press coverage to see what’s out there and what you need to be careful about.   Malware  Malware  malicious software  – a term used to describe everything from viruses through to hacker attacks – changes every day and is constantly evolving.   A quick  bit  of  history  first.  Malicious  software  first  started  appearing  on dedicated networks such as the ARPANET way back in the 1970s. The boom in personal  computers,  initiated  by  Apple  in  the  early  1980s,  led  to  a corresponding  boom  in  viruses.  As  more  and  more  people  gained  hands-on access to computers, they were able to learn how the machines worked. And some individuals inevitably used their knowledge with malicious intent.  Malware comes in various different shapes and sizes. At the moment network worms are a particular problem as they spread very quickly over the internet or through local area networks. Their particular purpose is to penetrate remote machines on the network  yours , then launch copies of the program on these victim machines, which in turn spread further infections to new machines.   Classic viruses have gone a bit out of fashion in recent years, but they can still cause utter devastation on a victim’s computer by launching and or executing malicious code on your machine that then spreads throughout your computer wreaking havoc. The important thing to understand about these classic viruses is that, unlike worms, viruses do not use networks to penetrate other machines. Copies  of  viruses  can  penetrate  other  machines  only  if  an  infected  object  is opened  you initiate the program or code  and the code is launched by a user on an uninfected machine.   Trojan programs are also popular at the moment and are hugely varied and extremely  dangerous.  They  perform  actions  without  the  user’s  knowledge  or consent:  collecting  data  and  sending  it  to  a  cyber  criminal,  destroying  or altering data with malicious intent, causing the computer to malfunction, or using  a  machine’s  capabilities  for  malicious  or  criminal  purposes,  such  as  42   2 – Securing Your Computer  sending spam. You’ll hear a lot about the many different varieties of Trojans including Backdoors, Trojan clickers and even ArcBombs!  How do you know if you’re infected?  Malware in all its gloriously horrible incarnations makes your computer behave strangely. Common symptoms reported to the experts at a great website called www.viruslist.com include:                              unexpected messages or images are suddenly displayed; unusual sounds or music played at random;  your CD-ROM drive mysteriously opens and closes; programs suddenly start without warning on your computer; you  receive  notification  from  your  firewall that  some  applications  have attempted to connect to the internet, although you didn’t initiate this; your friends mention that they have received messages from your address that you know you did not send; and your mailbox contains a lot of messages without a sender’s email address or message header.  Viruslist.com also warns you to look out for ‘secondary symptoms’ including:  your computer freezes frequently or encounters errors; your computer slows down when programs are started; the operating system is unable to load;  files and folders have been deleted or their content has changed;  your hard drive is accessed too often  the light on your main unit flashes rapidly ; and     Microsoft Internet Explorer freezes or functions erratically e.g. you cannot  close the application window.  Not  all  these  symptoms  are  necessarily  caused  by  malware  badly  installed software, faulty device drivers that need updating or severe hardware problems could always be the culprits , but always be on your guard when things start to go systematically wrong, or your computer starts to appreciably slow down – it could be malware! The simplest way of combating malware is to install a top  range  anti-virus program,  but  I’d  also  recommend  a  number  of  regular tasks including some or all of the following.  43   The Downloader’s Handbook  1. Every month check out the hit parade for top viruses  Most of the big virus software vendors run their own ‘Top Virus' list  usually accessed via their website , but in my opinion Sophos  www.sophos.com  is the best. As I write this, variants of the Netsky worm are top of the virus hit parade. According to Sophos the Netsky virus accounts for just under 20% of all the virus'  stopped  by  their  software  -  in  real  terms  that  equates  to  hundreds  of thousands of emails every day! That's an awful lot of nasty malware floating around  out  there.  But  it  gets  worse:  according  to  another  vendor  called MessageLabs, virus infection rates are currently running at around 1 per 240 emails. By the time this book is published some new mutant nasty malware will have appeared and started wreaking havoc. Be alert and mug up on the enemy.  2. If there’s a particularly virulent virus around, find out about it  Sometimes, just sometimes, you’ll get a nasty surprise – your anti-virus security software won’t stop a virus. It does happen, trust me. If this is the case you need to be smart and simply be aware of what’s particularly virulent at the moment.   Let’s take a current example – you might for instance want to mug up on a particularly horrid piece of malware I mentioned above called Klez. This is a mass-mailing  worm  which  searches  the  Windows  address  book  for  email addresses and sends messages to all recipients that it finds. The worm uses its own SMTP engine to send the messages. It can also spoof the ‘From’ address in messages, a factor that has resulted in widespread confusion about the bug. The subject and attachment name of incoming emails is randomly chosen, making it  harder  for  users  to  spot.  The  attachment  will  have  one  of  the  following extensions: .bat, .exe, .pif or .scr.  3.  Take  special  care  when  you’re  downloading  files  from  file  sharing networks like BitTorrent  We’ll encounter the big file sharing networks a little later in this book but one particular word of warning – malware designers are fashion conscious. If they know there are lots of people using one particular type of network or program they’ll target them with specially designed nasties. Take The Nopir-B worm, for instance, which appears to have originated in France, and specifically targeted file sharing networks, pretending to be a program that allowed you to make copies of commercial DVDs. Of course it didn’t and instead attempted to delete  44   2 – Securing Your Computer  MP3  music  files  on  infected  PCs.  The  worm  normally  arrived  at  the  target computers as an executable file and activated when a user launched it.  Don’t panic – what to do if your computer is infected  The  helpful  experts  at  Viruslist.com  have  compiled  a  handy  ‘get  out  of  jail’ checklist of things to do if you are infected and you don’t have any anti-virus software installed:  1. Disconnect from the internet straight away. 2. Try  rebooting  using  something  called  ‘Safe  Mode’.  This  is  helpful  if  the CD DVD player stops working. To access this: reboot and keep pressing F8. 3. Back up all important data to a CD DVD, a floppy disc or an external hard  4.  drive. If you can get online, try and download free anti-virus software and then run a full scan.   5. Alternatively you can go to Trend Micro’s website and use its online virus  scanner called HouseCall. See the section below.   6. You  may  also  find  that  if  you’ve  been  infected  by  one  of  the  popular viruses  or  worms,  the  main anti-virus software  vendors  will  also  have  a clean up tool available for free on their websites. The best way of finding out about this is to type the name of the likely virus or worm into Google and  then  add  ‘tool’  and  you’ll  usually  find  the  specific  clean  up  and detection tools available for free from the big vendors like Symantec and Norton.  Step 3 – Anti-virus software You have a simple choice when it comes to anti-virus software – either pay for an all singing, all dancing anti-virus product from the likes of Symantec, or get a free  program  from  an  up  and  coming  security  vendor  eager  to  build  a reputation.  In most other markets the difference between the two would be huge, but not here – free anti-virus software is every bit as good as the paid-for variety. It may not have all the bells and whistles of the paid-for version but in my experience they work just as well – I’ve used the two free software packages AVG and Avast for over six years and I’ve only ever suffered one serious virus infection.   45   The Downloader’s Handbook  AVG versus Avast  Here’s an oddity. Both of the free anti-virus software packages featured here, AVG  and  Avast,  are  Czech.  Coincidence?  I  think  not.  If  you’re  a  small  East European  software  company  with  lots  of  technical  expertise  but  no  global marketing the only way to build a global presence is to give your stuff away.  Program profile – AVG and Avast  User What it is  Why bother Source Difficulty How long will it take  to master  All Free anti-virus software from either AVG  or Avast They defend your computer against viruses www.avast.com or www.grisoft.com Very easy About ten minutes  The cynics amongst you may be wondering how they make any money. The answer  is  that  although  the  software  is  free  to  you  and  I,  commercial organisations have to pay a fee. The logic is that if your employees are familiar with the technology at home, they might just suggest using it at work. And it seems  like www.download.com and  you’ll  see  that  millions  of  people  have  downloaded both programs, with 1 million new customers signing up to AVG every month!  to  big  shareware  and  freeware  to  work  –  go   sites   Are they reliable?  The short answer is, yes. The main index used to measure an anti-virus systems’ reliability is called VB100 and both have passed this key test.   The VB100 gold standard is published by a newsletter called the Virus Bulletin  owned  by  an  anti-virus company  called  Sophos   and  measures  whether  the program will detect all “In the Wild viruses” during a scan. Both Avast and AVG have passed the threshold for this VB100 standard in recent years  although they  haven’t  passed  the  test  every  year  in  the  past  five  years   and  both  are regarded as ‘reliable’ by the pros.   46   2 – Securing Your Computer  Which one to use? Frankly, they’re both very good. In my experience AVG:            is easier to use; and has a nicer layout;  but there have been grumblings from some users that its ‘update’ tool is not working  too  efficiently,  sometimes  leaving  users  exposed  to  old  virus databases; and it  can  take  a  very  long  time  to  scan  folders  or  individual  files  and  is generally a bit slow; and you also don’t get email support beyond Outlook built into the program.    By contrast, Avast:  boasts a slightly more stylish yet complicated layout; does seem to be slightly better, and quicker, at spotting viruses;        Avast  surpasses  AVG  by  scanning  both  Outlook  and  standard  internet  POP3 SMTP   mail,  making  it  a  good  choice  if  you  use  a  non-Microsoft mail client; and  amazingly, the company behind Avast, Alwil, also offers support via email for its free product.      TIP:  If you’re new to broadband and slightly hesitant about computers use  AVG,  if  you’re  more  confident  and  worried  about  viruses  get Avast.   AVG  Remember  that  AVG’s  developers  Grisoft,  like  rival  Avast,  makes  its  money from satisfied users who graduate on to a registered paid-for version with full after sales support. That means they’ll do their best to convince you to upgrade to the full or paid-for versions. In AVG’s case that means that if you visit their main  website at  www.grisoft.com you’ll  struggle  to  find  their  free  version  – you’ll  be  bombarded  instead  with  chances  to  sign  up  for  the  paid  for  Pro version.  47   The Downloader’s Handbook  Installing AVG  1. Visit free.grisoft.com. There you’ll see an option that says ‘Get AVG Free’.  Click on this and download the file.   2. You’ll then have to install the program as you would any other  opt for  standard installation .  3. You’ll be asked to register your software by sending your email address to Grisoft. They’ll then send you back an email with a registration key. Either take a note of the key or highlight the text and numbers, and then right click, ‘Copy’. When asked to enter the key simply press ‘Paste’.  4. Once installed, you’ll see a quick First Run Wizard. This will ask you to update  the  file   which  you  should  do  and  shouldn’t  take  more  than  a minute , register for the free support website  you can do this later , run a system scan  which you can also do later  and create a rescue disk  which you should definitely do straightaway .  5. Once you’ve finished with the First Run Wizard you’ll be sent straight to  the main AVG front page.

How to configure AVG  AVG – Control Center  Select  each  of  the  tabs   Resident  Shield,  Email  Scanner,  Update  Manager, Scheduler, Information . You’ll then see a button with Properties – these control the settings on the program. Leave most of them at default.   It’s worth checking the box that says Scheduler. This runs the automatic scans for viruses on your computer. Press on the button that Schedules Tasks and set the time to whenever you’re unlikely to be using the computer. As standard the program will leave it at 8am. I prefer to run my tests at 2am.   If  you  leave  your  computer  on  most  of  or  all  day  and have  a  broadband connection, use automatic settings.  t f o s i r G   49   The Downloader’s Handbook  AVG scanning  When you do run a full system scan or choose to scan certain drives or files, you’ll see the screen below appear:  If it does find a virus you’ll then see a box appear.

If you operate a home network it will not scan other computers on the network or even network hard drives.   50   2 – Securing Your Computer  Tips for using AVG  AVG, like Avast, works very well with the latest Service Pack 2 update for XP. But make sure that once you’ve installed the update the Security Center keeps telling you if the update facility of AVG – “Virus Protection” alert – is working. Go to ‘Control Panel’, select ‘Security Center’, and then select: ‘Change the way Security Center notifies me’  select desired option .   t f o s i r G   Due to the heavy server demand, updating AVG can sometimes be very slow. It’s best to select an off-peak time for updates.  One particularly annoying feature of AVG is that it likes to ‘Certify outgoing messages’, which is actually just an advertisement for AVG and is not really needed.  Go  to  the  AVG  Control  Center,  select  ‘Email  Scanner’,  then  select ‘Properties’, then ‘Configure’ and ‘uncheck’ ‘Certify outgoing messages’.  If AVG detects a malware file in the System Restore folder it won’t be able to remove it. Turn off System Restore, reboot and then run a full AVG system scan, and then turn System Restore back on and create a new ‘Restore Point’.  Avast  You’ll  easily  find  Avast’s  free  software  on  its  main  page  at  www.avast.com. Download the file – currently 2.5MB in size – and then install as normal.   When it’s finally loaded, you’ll be asked to register the program. You don’t have to do this straightaway as you have sixty days to register through its website. Registration is free.  t s a v A   51   The Downloader’s Handbook  Configure the program for maximum protection – Avast’s heuristics  scanning techniques  used  to  trap  new  and  unknown  viruses   are  set  to  medium sensitivity by default. To configure the program for maximum safety, click its system tray icon, then click on ‘Start Avast AntiVirus’ and then click on the settings symbol – the ‘a’ symbol – to open the on-access scanner’s settings, and then move the scanner sensitivity slider to ‘High’. The downside of setting an anti-virus program to its highest security level is that it might noticeably slow PC performance. If you’re stuck with an older machine, you may need to go with the default security settings.   The lightning symbol controls the updates and the disc drive icon lets you start a systems scan or a scan of specific files.  You can control all the settings on the program by highlighting the symbol and then right clicking. This gives you the chance to alter the settings.  Avast settings  t s a v A   Avast has one great, hidden feature – it will run a system scan as a form of screensaver. This is a wonderful little tool and can be accessed by going to the control panel, selecting ‘Display’, then ‘Screensaver’. You should see Avast as one of the options for the screensaver. Select and then everytime the system goes quiet Avast will run a system scan.  52   2 – Securing Your Computer  The alternative – an online scan  If you want to be absolutely sure that you are completely virus free, you can also run an occasional online scan with Trend Micro’s HouseCall.   I always run this every month in addition to using Avast and especially after I’ve finished a particularly heavy round of downloading. It’s free and easy to use – it installs a tiny bit of scanner software on your computer  which you have to download  that then runs a full system scan. It’s not quick but it works – and it even offers you the facility to clear your computer of any malware infections.

To finish the test you obviously need to stay online throughout the scan.  Step 4 – Spyware Spyware is annoying software that’s installed without your informed consent and  communicates  personal,  confidential  information  about  you  to  a  third party.  The  information  might  be  reports  on  your  web-surfing  habits,  or  the software might be looking for even more sinister information, such as sniffing out your credit card numbers.  Sounds scary, but how does this software get on your computer? Look in the mirror – spyware is usually installed unknowingly by you, the user. ‘Permission’ is at the heart of the issue when it comes to spyware. Creators of spyware need your okay to install their products on your system. This is done by making any reference to the program as obscure as possible when you click on a site or install a program.   54   2 – Securing Your Computer  Here’s  how  it  might  work.  One  particularly  heinous  spyware program  called Gator, innocently offers to load a program that will help improve your internet browsing experience. If you click OK to the request, the Gator software will be installed  on  your  computer  and  you’ll  suddenly  notice  an  explosion  of unwanted ads and targeted advertising.  Even more reasons why you should hate spyware        It slows your computer down and it can even disable some programs from working properly. It hijacks your browser. This will cause your home page to be set to some site  you  never  wanted   usually  pornographic .  It  usually  does  this  by adding a toolbar to Internet Explorer, usually full of spyware and viruses.  How to stop spyware  Task 1: Beware of ActiveX  The  chief  channel  for  transmitting  spyware  is  through  ActiveX controls conveyed over pop-up windows. A single click on a window that says “Click Here  To  Claim  Your  Surprise  Gift”  might  give  you  a  real  surprise,  by downloading spyware in the form of an ActiveX control  these are programs that  are  transferred  across  the  net  and  then  executed .  Some  pop-ups  also contain  a  big  button  marked,  “Click  Here  To  Close  Pop-up,”  or  some  similar text. Clicking on the button might actually activate a hidden ActiveX control that  downloads  spyware.  Not  all  ActiveX controls  are  bad  –  Java  based programs and websites make extensive use of the technology, but beware.  Tip: Don’t  click  on  links  within  popups  —  pop-up windows  are  often spyware activators. Close the popup with the “X” on the titlebar and not the “close” link, if any, within the window. Also always choose ‘no’ when asked unexpected questions and generally be careful of unexpected dialog boxes asking whether you want to take a given action.   55   The Downloader’s Handbook  Task 2: Check out any unknown programs gobbling up system resources  Bring up the Windows Task Manager by hitting Ctrl-Alt-Delete and select the ‘Processes’ tab.   n o i t a r o p r o C  t f o s o r c i M m o r f  n o i s s i m r e p  h t i  w d e t n i r p e r  t o h s  n e e r c s  t c u d o r p  t f o s o r c i M   Click the CPU column twice and if you’ve got any spyware you’re likely to see a few processes hogging as much as 90% of the CPU. The Image Name column may  give  you  a  few  clues  –  beware  anything  with  names  like  Gator,  GAIN, QuickBrowser Update or TSA.  If you don’t know what the image file represents, do an online search for the names that appear in the Image Name column using Google or your favourite search engine. If the processes are spies, simply click the End Process button for each of them.  Task 3: Install numerous anti-spyware programs  There are a lot of clever malware and spyware programmers out there who have a lot of time on their hands to design clever new programs that will spy on you  56   2 – Securing Your Computer  and make them money. That means that spyware can prove quite difficult to remove, even for dedicated anti-spyware scanners.   If you’re really determined to stop all the spyware on your system you need to install  more  than  one  program.  Even  the  best-performing  anti-spyware programs regularly miss dangerous malware.

Some  websites  like  eBay install  perfectly  harmless  cookies  that  simply  tell  the  site  who  you  are;  Ad- Aware will mix these up with malicious cookies that do need to be removed and destroyed. Carefully go down the list of objects and vendors and unclick anything you’re happy with. Then press Next…  If Ad-Aware found any spyware, you should empty your recycling bin, restart your computer and scan again to make sure it is completely removed. Make sure to rescan your computer weekly.

After you’ve immunised yourself and run a full system search it’ll just keep running in the background providing you with constant protection.  Tip: Find out what ActiveX controls have been installed. Service Pack 2 for  Windows  XP  adds  a  nifty  little  feature  to  Internet  Explorer  6 that lets you view detailed information about small programs called Browser  Helper  Objects   BHO   and  ActiveX controls  installed  on your system. Many of these are enormously useful – they control how  Java  plug-ins  are  controlled  or  enable  web-based  software updates. But some of these BHOs and ActiveX controls are not so friendly and some may end up infecting you.   t o b y p S   61   The Downloader’s Handbook  Luckily  Spybot  has  a  tool  that  lets  you  view  detailed  information  about  all installed  ActiveX controls  and  BHOs  and  then  get  rid  of  the  ones  you  don’t want.  Go to Advanced mode. Click on mode in the top right corner of the screen and select ‘Advanced Mode’. Then, click ‘Tools’ and then click on the ‘ActiveX’ and ‘BHO’ boxes, selecting both.

Those without either sign are unknown – if you want to check on them simply click on the line and you’ll see further details listed. If you’ve still no idea what the program is, check it out  at  Google   type  in  a  question   and  if  you’re  still  worried  click  on  the ‘Remove’ button at the top of this screen.   62   Spybot – ActiveX controls  2 – Securing Your Computer  To view detailed information about a BHO or ActiveX control, just click it. If you think the object should be removed, click the ‘Remove’ button. Be careful – what might seem suspicious is in fact perfectly harmless or even essential to an important program! If you are not sure whether or not to remove an object, your best bet is to check through Google or ask a detailed question at an online help forum.  Another  tool  within  Spybot’s  Advanced  section  lets  you  control  which programs  automatically  come  on  when  you  start  up  your  computer. In  the Advanced Tool mode you’ll see an option on the left hand column that says ‘System Startup’. This shows you all the programs that load up when you start XP. If  you  have  too  many  programs  starting  up  it  can  sometimes  slow  the whole process of rebooting considerably.   t o b y p S   63   The Downloader’s Handbook  Spybot – Search & Destroy System Startup  t o b y p S   If you click on this Tool you’ll see a long list of programs that are present at Start Up.

Weapon 3 – Microsoft’s Giant killer  Program profile – Windows Defender  Beta   Beginner and experienced A program that roots out spyware It stops people spying on your computer www.microsoft.com athome security spyware  software  Easy A few minutes  User What it is Why bother Source  Difficulty How long will  it take to master  64   2 – Securing Your Computer  A few years back a small software company started developing yet another free anti-spyware system called giant. It worked brilliantly, so brilliantly in fact that Bill Gates at Microsoft paid attention and started wondering out loud whether his Windows OS needed some kind of anti-spyware system like Giant. In true Victor Kiam style he decided that he did and decided to buy Giant rather than develop his own.  Microsoft’s AntiSpyware – recently renamed Defender – is now available freely through the main Microsoft.com website and it’s a wonderful piece of software. It integrates beautifully with XP and should be used in conjunction with both Ad-Aware and Spybot.   One potential, future, downside – it’s still a beta test product. Microsoft haven’t said yet whether they intend to keep providing the software for free and it’s a fair bet that they might start charging for it  if they haven’t already by the time you start reading this .   Beta – Front page  The main page itself is very elegantly and simply laid out. To run a scan simply press the ‘Run Quick Scan Now’ button.  t f o s o r c i M  m o r f  n o i s s i m r e p  h t i  w  d e t n i r p e r  t o h s  n e e r c s  t c u d o r p  t f o s o r c i M  65  n o i t a r o p r o C     The Downloader’s Handbook  Beta – Scanning  t f o s o r c i M  m o r f  n o i s s i m r e p  h t i  w  d e t n i r p e r  t o h s  n e e r c s  t c u d o r p  t f o s o r c i M  n o i t a r o p r o C    One very powerful feature of this software is its Real-time Protection function. This monitors all activity on your computer – and runs regular daily checks – and  then  cross-references  any  suspicious  software  with  SpyNet,  a  global community of users.  Microsoft Defender also lets you view detailed information about any processes or programs  that  may  be  currently  running  on  your  machine  –  these  could include  spyware and  other  malware that  are  using  system  resources  and generally  spying  on  you.  To  use  this  feature  click  on  ‘Tools’,  and  then ‘Advanced Tools’ and ‘System Explorers’. Then click on the left hand column, underneath  Applications,  select  Running  Processes.  You’ll  now  see  a  list  of process  names  and  descriptions  –  click  on  a  process  to  view  more  detailed information   if  available .  You  can  also  stop  a  process  from  running  if  you think it’s potentially dangerous. With the vast majority of processes you can click on them and in the right hand Application Details box you’ll see ‘This is a known process’.   66   Beta – Advanced Tools  2 – Securing Your Computer  Tip: This program has one extra, very useful feature.

This restores  your  internet  browser  to  its  normal  settings  if  it’s  been hijacked by one of the many internet browser malware hijackers.  Step 5 – Firewall  Note: A firewall is essential if you have a broadband connection. If you  don’t have one – get one now!  What’s a firewall?  It’s  either  built  into  your  hardware   into  the  router  for  instance   or  works through  a  software  program,  and  limits  access  to  your  computer  from  a network and also limits your computer’s access to other networks.  t f o s o r c i M  m o r f  n o i s s i m r e p  h t i  w  d e t n i r p e r  t o h s  n e e r c s  t c u d o r p  t f o s o r c i M  n o i t a r o p r o C    67   The Downloader’s Handbook  If used properly, a firewall gives you excellent protection against direct attacks from the internet, because computers’ communication ports can’t be seen over the internet if the firewall is set up properly. Many hackers use what are called ‘open communication ports’ to contact your computer and ultimately control it – if  there  are  no  ports  available,  naturally  there  is  nothing  to  contact.  That could mean your computer avoids being turned into a ‘zombie machine’ – this happens when a hacker gains subtle and non-intrusive control over a machine, ordering it on to the internet to perform certain specified functions.   What a firewall isn’t  A firewall does not replace your anti-virus software or let you off the hook if you’re entirely stupid and careless. It won’t stop files on your computer being corrupted  nor  spreading  of  viruses  and  worms.  It  does,  however,  usually prevent  harmful  trojan  horse  programs  and  other  backdoor  programs  from contacting the net and opening your computer to some hacker.   How do firewalls work?  Software-based  firewalls  such  as  ZoneAlarm are  easy-to-use  programs  that allow  you  to  configure  the  way  in  which  communication  requests  to  your computer and to the network are handled. Their strongest feature is that they allow  you  to  easily  set  up  a  configuration  that  blocks  all  outgoing communications without your specific permission.   Your computer is vulnerable to attack in one of two ways: the file system and what’s called the network stack, which is the ‘protocol’ that defines network communications. The file system, by contrast, is usually protected by anti-virus software that scans incoming email attachments and file downloads as well as inspecting files before loading, saving or executing them.   But your computer can also become infected whenever you’re connected to the internet  —    even  if  your  email  program  and  browser  are  closed  —  through attacks against the network stack. Every computer connected to the internet has a unique address  the IP, or Internet Protocol, address  so communication can be directed to it. And with broadband, your IP address is always the same, so hackers can probe your computer at leisure.  Firewalls protect your computer’s endpoints of communication  as opposed to the  USB  and  other  ports  used  to  connect  devices  to  the  computer .  Many  68   2 – Securing Your Computer  internet  services  use  specific  ports  –  HTTP  web  traffic  is  usually  on  port  80 while file transfers  FTP  are usually on port 21. An open port can give hackers a way in, so firewalls close and hide all unused ports. Use of other ports is then governed by a clearly defined set of rules. A firewall, for example, may allow outgoing FTP requests but not incoming  so you can download files from the internet, but others can’t pull files from your hard disk .  But what about the Windows XP firewall?  According to Microsoft, only 10% of its personal computer users have a firewall installed, a horrifyingly small percentage. Microsoft realised, bless them, that this  represented  a  monumental  security  black  hole  and  so  resolved  to  do something about it. The answer? Their own firewall built as standard into their latest  operating  system.  Windows  XP  now  ships  with  its  own  perfectly respectable  firewall.  If  you’ve  upgraded  your  XP  to  Service  Pack  2  this  will automatically switch itself on, but if not you’ll have to activate it yourself.   Go  to  Start  >  Control  Panel  >  Network  and  internet  connections  >  Network connections, then right click on your internet connection  which should be at the top of the page  and select ‘Properties’.  m o r f  n o i s s i m r e p  h t i  w  d e t n i r p e r  t o h s  n e e r c s  t c u d o r p  n o i t a r o p r o C  t f o s o r c i M  t f o s o r c i M   69   The Downloader’s Handbook  Now go to the ‘Advanced’ tab and place a check in the ‘Internet Connection Firewall’ box.   t f o s o r c i M  m o r f  n o i s s i m r e p  h t i  w  d e t n i r p e r  t o h s  n e e r c s  t c u d o r p  t f o s o r c i M   n o i t a r o p r o C  Sounds great and free! Should I use it?  Microsoft’s Defender anti-spyware software may be one of the best free security systems on the market, but its firewall is far from adequate. My advice is to get a better third party program, like ZoneAlarm. Why?  Windows’ firewall has one very big, very important failing – it lacks outbound blocking,  an  absolute  requirement  for  a  good  all  purpose  firewall.  Inbound blocking  —  something  which  all  firewalls   including  Microsoft’s   do  –  keeps illegitimate  traffic  from  entering  computers  through  your  ports.  But  what inbound blocking doesn’t do is stop a malicious payload from piggybacking on legitimate  traffic  such  as  email  or  web  traffic  going  to  Outlook  or  Internet Explorer. Once a malicious payload gets in, your inbound firewall kicks in. But malware designers are getting smarter by the day and not every nasty piece of code will be stopped by these programs – for that you need outbound blocking.   Also, the Windows firewall lacks one other crucial feature found on programs like ZoneAlarm – total lock down. This allows you to block all traffic if you  70   2 – Securing Your Computer  think  your  computer  has  been  infected  or  captured  –  any  in  or  outbound network  activity  that  isn’t  explicitly  allowed  by  the  pre-existing  rules  is blocked. Basically, there’s no way to disable it unless you reboot the machine and uninstall the software.   Should I dump Windows firewall and use something else?  The  short  answer  is,  yes.  Many  of  you  may  be  tempted  to  run  two  firewall programs – the XP one and a third party one like ZoneAlarm – but my advice is simple, don’t. Personal firewalls sometimes require a significant amount of tweaking  and  configuration  to  make  them  as  secure  as  possible  without impacting  your  ability  to  communicate  on  the  network.  Adding  a  second firewall on  the  same  system  can  greatly  confuse  matters  and  make  it exceptionally difficult to determine where any connection problems might lie or what you need to change to make it work. The simple answer is to switch the  XP  firewall off  and  install  a  proper  dedicated  third  party  firewall like ZoneAlarm.   And don’t worry – XP will recognise the third party software and work with it. Software from the likes of ZoneAlarm is recognised by Security Center, and it will understand that you are in fact protected.  The firewall of choice – ZoneAlarm  ZoneAlarm is a hugely popular software-based firewall and justifiably so:   1. 2. 3.  it’s free; it’s easy to set up and use on a day to day basis; and  it works.  71   The Downloader’s Handbook  Program profile – ZoneAlarm  User What it is Why bother  Source Difficulty  How long will it  take to master  Beginner and experienced A software program that installs a firewall on your PC It stops hackers accessing your computer using the  internet www.zonealarm.com Moderately easy although running a home network can  be very tricky Ten to twenty minutes  Go to the main ZoneAlarm website at www.zonealarm.com and click on the ‘Download & Buy’ option on the top left hand side of the screen. You’ll now see  ZoneAlarms  full  range  of  programs  –  scan  along  and  pick  the  free  one called ZoneAlarm. Make sure you don’t pick the paid for Pro version as it will disable itself after your one month free trial is up.   Install the program as usual. You’ll now be taken through a number of different boxes, with registration boxes and configuration settings. One of the first asks for user information – your name and email. You don’t have to bother with this as you can register later if you want.   You’re then asked to fill out a perfectly innocent survey, asking you details of how you intend to use the firewall. Make sure you say you’ll use the computer at home for personal use – any commercial usage is prohibited with this free version.  After  installation  is  complete,  ZoneAlarm will  probably  try  to encourage  you  one  last  time  to  take out  the  professional  version,  Pro,  by comparing all the wonderful features missing on the free download. Hit ‘Select ZoneAlarm free download’ unless you do want to spend money on a proper professional firewall, which is by the way excellent and worth the money if you’re a small business looking for property network security.  You’ll now be given the chance to establish some settings for the program using the Configuration Wizard. First up, you’ll be asked when you want to be alerted to any ‘blocked’ traffic. Personally I like to be informed at all times, so click the ‘Alert  Me’  box. You’ll  also  be  asked  whether  you  want  ZoneAlarm to  pre- configure access permissions – these are the rules you set that govern which  72   2 – Securing Your Computer  programs can access your network ports. I like to set these manually so I know what’s going on at all times, so select ‘No, Alert Me Later’.   You’re  not  done  yet.  There’s  still  time  for  the  Tutorial.  It  explains  how  the program  works  and  is  well  worth  the  bother.  A  little  under  ten  slides  later you’re ready to use the program.   Configuring ZoneAlarm  If you intend to become a prolific internet user and downloader it’s really worth exploring how your firewall works, especially if you want to run a small home network sharing files between computers.  The first page is the Overview Page – this gives you a brief overview of the various programs that are allowed, the ones that are blocked and whether email monitoring is switched on.   ZoneAlarm – Overview  Click on the ‘Preferences’ tab at the top and check that ZoneAlarm has been set up to automatically update and that ZoneAlarm will load at Start Up.   l  m r a A e n o Z   73   The Downloader’s Handbook  l  m r a A e n o Z   Next, look to the column of options on the left hand side and select ‘Firewall’. Back at the top right hand side of the page you’ll see two options: Main and Zones.   Let’s  start  with  Main  –  this  is  a  hugely  important  page  that  allows  you  to dictate how secure you want to be on the internet. Your first options are for the internet and range from High to Low. Make sure this is set to High – this hides your  computer’s  ports  and  disallows  all  sharing  from  your  computer  to  the internet. Trusted Zone is for computers that you trust, like the ones in your own network,  or  if  you  have  a  shared  network  printer. Medium  level  is  fine  for Trusted Zone, but you might need to set it to ‘Low’ in some cases to able to use and share printers and files in your local network. The default settings here are quite safe.   74   ZoneAlarm – Firewall  2 – Securing Your Computer  Now click on the ‘Zones’ tab at the top right hand side. You’ll now see a list of the zones you’ve created that allow safe networking. This page allows you to configure your home network if you do decide to set one up. Unless you tell your firewall that computers are allowed to talk to each within a home network it will block all traffic. To enable a small home network simply click on the Add >>> button at the bottom left hand side – you’ll be given the choice to choose from  Host-IP  site  through  to  Subnet.  To  set  up  a  home  network  choose  ‘IP Address’.   l  m r a A e n o Z   75   Select ‘Trusted’ – you’re telling the firewall that the other home computers are ‘trusted’. You  now  need  to  give  ZoneAlarm the  IP  addresses  of  the  other computers on the network. To find an IP address simply go to the computer you want  to  add  to  the  network,  click  on  its  ‘My  Network  Places’,  then  go  to ‘Network  Tasks  box’,  and  select  ‘View  Network  Connections’. If  you  have installed  a  wireless   or  wired   network  you’ll  see  it  listed   with  a  title  like Wireless Network Connection 1 or 2 . Double click on this icon and a new box called Network Connections Status window will appear. At the top of the box you’ll see Support, click on this and then you’ll see the IP address assigned to that  computer.  Now  enter  that  address  into  the  Trusted  Zones  box  with  a description and then hit OK.   The Downloader’s Handbook  76   2 – Securing Your Computer  77  Your  firewall has  now  been  told  to  recognise  the  network  computer  for incoming  and  outgoing  internet  and  file  traffic.  Going  back  to  the Firewall Zones screen, you should now see the computer listed as Trusted.   The Downloader’s Handbook  ZoneAlarm – Firewall program control  l  m r a A e n o Z   Now let’s go to the Program Control box – look at the top left hand side of the screen and select programs. You’ll see a list of all the programs that you have allowed to use the network or the internet. Whenever a program tries to access the internet – to update itself for instance – you should see a box appear asking your  permission.  If  you  recognise  the  program  click  ‘Allow’  and  click ‘Remember this setting’, but if you are not absolutely sure this program is safe to be allowed to connect, you should click ‘No’. You can change these settings later from within the Programs tab at the ZoneAlarm settings.  78   l  m r a A e n o Z   Once you’ve set all the permissions for different programs you should see the full list of programs in the Program Control box.  2 – Securing Your Computer  l  m r a A e n o Z   79   The Downloader’s Handbook  Tip: Beware  any  program  trying  to  get  access  to  server  rights.  Never allow programs to have server rights, unless you really know what you are doing. Practically all backdoor programs  trojans  want to have server rights, so better to play it very, very safe here. It is likely that  the  program  that  wants  server  rights  is  a  program  that  will allow other people to access the files on your computer. You can later  change  these  settings  from  the  Programs  tab  at  the ZoneAlarm settings.  l  m r a A e n o Z   Double up your firewalls – use a hardware firewall as well  As broadband has taken off, so have sales of routers – devices for sharing an internet  connection.  These  networking  devices  are  installed  between  your cable DSL modem connection and your home computer network and almost all include  some  form  of  firewall protection  to  filter  the  data  that  enters  your network from the internet.   80   2 – Securing Your Computer  There  are  a  huge  number  of  different  brands  of  routers  out  there,  but  most function  in  a  similar  way.  The  firewall can  be  configured  by  using  a  web browser  like  Internet  Explorer  to  navigate  to  the  router’s  built-in  IP  address  consult your documentation for this information  – the device contains a set of HTTP web pages which can be used to configure it.   This type of protection is known as a hardware firewall – it’s a separate device that  guards  the  entrance  to  a  network,  not  an  individual  computer.  Unlike software firewalls, such as ZoneAlarm, hardware firewalls are always active as long as the device itself is switched on. The only basic configuration necessary is to network your computers to the device correctly and enter your internet connection information.  The  important  point  is  to  use  a  hardware-based  firewall in  addition  to  a software version. Because these hardware firewalls are external to your system, they can’t monitor which programs are opening outbound connections, so they can’t  replace  a  software  firewall running  on  the  PC.  However,  they  do  keep incoming attacks off your local network, and they can shield your machine’s IP address from the outside world, further protecting you from external attacks.  81   The Downloader’s Handbook  Ten point security action checklist  1. Make  sure  Windows  XP  regularly  updates  itself.  To  do  this  make  sure that Windows Updater is switched on.  2. Make sure you know every month what the top virus threat is on  the internet.  3. Have  a  back-up plan  in  place  in  case  your  computer  is  heavily infected. Back-up all your key documents in My Documents to an external source every month. Install all three anti-spyware programs. Install  either  AVG  or  AVAST  anti-spyware  and  make  sure  they update regularly and also run a full system scan at least every week. 6. Always be very careful of downloading ActiveX controls. See who  4. 5.  7.  provides the software or plug-in. If  you  can  afford  to,  install  a  router  and  a  network.  Hardware routers are an excellent security tool. Install ZoneAlarm Free and make sure it’s the very latest version.  8. 9. Always  scan  any  file  you  download  from  a  file  sharing  network.  Never open it up without scanning it.   10. Don’t trust any attachments in an email. Always scan them before opening and if possible make sure your virus scanner has built in email support.  In this chapter we looked at the steps you need to take to make your computer secure. In detail, we looked at anti-virus software, spyware and firewalls. That’s it! Your hardware should now be up to spec and secure. You’re ready to start listening to music – the topic of the next chapter.  82   3  Digital Music    3 – Digital Music  The easiest form of digital, multi media content to master is music. Compared to  video,  music  is  easy  to  download,  widely  available  over  legal  music download networks  we’ll talk about this in our next chapter  and, in the great scheme of things, easy to edit and manipulate.   However,  just  before  we  go  any  further,  let’s  linger  on  the  meaning  of  the chapter title: digital music. In simple, layman’s language, digital music involves taking music from the analogue world, usually in the form of a CD, and in some way ripping  converting  the music into a digital file. You’ll hear a lot of nerds excitedly talk about this ‘ripping’, but don’t be too confused: it’s a simple term to describe the process by which the content on that CD is physically taken off the disc by a device like a computer CD player or some sort.  The resulting ripped content is then converted into a form of data that most computers can understand. As we’ll see in this chapter, there are lots of formats these files can be converted into, but they all share in common some form of compression.  This  compression  is  done  by  complex  mathematical  algorithms and  in  the  real  world  all  you  have  to  worry  about  is  the  quality  of  the conversion and the compression. Does the file sound hissy and noisy? Is the file of digital music too large to be put on a small capacity MP3 player?  The last step is to play the music. Which player to use is up to you – there’s plenty of choice out there – but not all players are created equal. Some  such as the Windows Media Player  are immensely powerful as we’ll discover, but a bit  unwieldy  and  complicated.  Others,  like  the  jetAudio player,  are  less  well known but incredibly simple to use. Pick the one that’ll work for you.  In this chapter you’ll learn how to: 1. Rip a CD onto your hard drive. 2. Play that music on your PC. 3. Convert that music into a smaller file that can be played on any PC  4. Learn about different file formats including MP3, MP4, WMA, OGG  or portable MP3 player.  and MPC.  5. Work out how to best use the popular Windows Media Player. 6. Record internet radio broadcasts.  In sum, this chapter is about three simple processes: ripping, compressing and playing.  85   The Downloader’s Handbook  Ripping software  Welcome to the world of Nero Every once in a while we pesky old world types manage to beat the Yanks at their own game and produce a clever bit of world-beating technology. Nero is one such example – a CD and DVD ripping and conversion program produced by German firm Ahead.  Program profile – Nero  User What it is  Why bother  Source Difficulty How long will it  take to master  Beginner The very best CD and DVD ripper, copier and burner  that money can buy It’s super fast, and jam packed full of features and  clever tools www.nero.com Easy Five minutes  Put simply, it’s the king of CD DVD burning and ripping software. It’s software handles  both  the  ripping  and  burning  of  discs  perfectly  and  is  worth  every penny, although you can get it free with some DVD burners.  If it doesn’t come with your computer, or DVD burner, you can try out the latest version  7 at the last count  for free at the main Nero site, www.nero.com. It gives you 30 days to give it a whirl before you have to buy. Download the file and then install it as usual  remembering to close any music player software you might have running at the time .  The  easiest  way  to  navigate  around  this  very  powerful  program  is  to  use SmartStart which will guide you through all the various options.  86   3 – Digital Music  o r e N   First tell Nero whether you’re working on either a CD or a DVD. This is easily done – look on the top right hand side of the screen and you’ll see either a DVD or CD. Click on the one you want.  Copying a music CD  Lets start with a nice and easy project – copying a music CD onto another blank CD.   Click on the star – Favourite – and then click on ‘Copy Disc’  making sure the disc you want to copy is in the drive first! .  The sub-program within the suite called Nero Burning Rom will now come up. You’ll see a main box giving you a number of options: these include Image, Copy Options, Read Options and Burn. You can use the preset options for most of the time – the only exception is if you want to keep an image copy of the CD on your hard drive. Why bother keeping an ‘image’ copy of the disc? Some people  worry  that  they’ll  lose  their  CDs  over  the  course  of  time   friends  not giving  them  back,  that  sort  of  thing   and  want  to  back  up  their  favourite albums. The easiest way to do this is, of course, to copy the album onto another blank CD disc, but keeping an image file is a longer term solution. What this  87   The Downloader’s Handbook  simply does is take a snapshot – an image file – of the CD and then save it to the hard drive. If this is what you want, click on the ‘Image’ tab and untick the little box that normally deletes the image file after the copying and burning.   When you’ve finished, press ‘Copy’ on the right hand side and away it goes copying the music. It may also offer you option of checking online with the big music databases like CDDB – these have a list of most of the albums and songs ever created and Nero cross-references the data on your disc with the online databases and then saves the ID3 tags to your computer.   The program now creates  very quickly  an image copy of the album. On my 24x  speed  CD DVD  burner  it  takes  less  than  3  minutes  to  create  the  whole image file.  When it’s finished this part of the process, you’re then asked to put in a blank disc. After you’ve done this, it then transfers the image file to the new disc, again in under 3 minutes.  When it’s finished simply press ‘Done’ and the new CD pops out ready to use in any Hi-Fi system.  Ripping a music CD  Time  to  go  back  to  the  main  StartSmart  screen.  This  time  select  the  main ‘Audio’ option  making sure you’ve still got the CD option selected  and click on ‘Rip CD Tracks’.   Nero now takes you to the main Save Tracks screen. It’ll almost instantly read all  the  tracks  on  the  album  and  also  present  you  with  a  small  table  that confirms the music data  album title, track names and so on  – select the right details and hit ‘Selected CD’.  You can hit the ‘Select All’ button and all the tracks will be ripped, or just one track  –  you  choose.  You’re  also  presented  with  the  option  of  using  different codecs  varying from Nero’s own version of MP4  through the Windows Media files. And, finally, you can pick the location of the burnt file.  There’s also a button on the bottom right hand side that says Options. This is mightily  useful  as  it  gives  you  a  number  of  options  you  should  definitely consider,  including  the  option  to  remove  silence  between  tracks,  jitter  88   3 – Digital Music  correction  and  the  option  to  automatically  create  a  playlist of  the  tracks selected. I tend to tick all the boxes.  When you’re ready just hit ‘GO’ and Nero will rip tracks in no time.  The Swiss army knife alternative – dBpowerAMP Visit www.dbpoweramp.com and you’ll see dBPowerAMP accurately described as the Swiss Army Knife of music ripping and burning. The most useful tool in an arsenal of handy programs is its Music Converter, a great way of ripping music on the fly and converting back and forth between different music codecs – it rips CDs incredibly quickly, is easy to use and it’s free.

While at the website I’d also recommend downloading from  the  Codec  Central  sub  site  key  audio  codecs  that  are  not included in the standard download – these include MP4 also known as AAC, OGG  aka OGG Vorbis , MPC or Musepack and the Windows Media plug-in.  You’ll have to separately download these codecs and install them all one by one – it’s all a bit time-consuming but well worth it. When you install the main program you’ll see a number of initial installation boxes, and one in particular will  confirm  to  you  the  various  components  installed  and  remind  you  that you’re not registered yet. Just press OK!  89   The Downloader’s Handbook  At  the  end  of  this  installation  process   remembering  to  install  the  different codecs   you’ll  have  two  main  programs:  the  DMC  Audio  CD  program  which does all the ripping and a separate dBPowerAMP Music Converter that lets you convert between MP4 and any other format.  The audio ripping software  Almost instantly the program reads whatever music CD is in your disc drive – like most of its peers it’ll also go online to check the music details with the music database Gracenote  formally CDDB  or its open source rival FreeDB. At the top of the screen you’ll then see the artist, the album and the genre.   You’ll also see in the top left hand side a small screen symbol that says Rip. Next to it you’ll see a small downwards arrow – click on that arrow and you’ll see a small menu come down. Select ‘Rip with Options’.  dBpowerAMP – Rip screen  p m A r e w o p B d   This brings up a new screen allowing you to set the options for your ripping. The most important option is to work out which kind of music codec to use – most of us will probably end up using MP3 or WMA, but there are some very powerful alternatives lurking around  see the next section on which codec to use . There’s also a slide bar that lets you determine the quality at which the  90   3 – Digital Music  music  data  is  imported.  Typically  with  MP3  the  very  best  results  are  above 300Kbps,  the  worst  below  100Kbps.  If  you’re  worried  about  the  size  of  the music  file  and  want  to  play  it  on  a  portable  music  player  with  only  small storage capacity  below say 500MB  then select 128Kbps or even lower.   You’re also given the option of changing the frequency rate of the sampling – make sure it’s set at 44100. You can also change the location of the saved file in this box. When you’re ready, hit ‘Convert’ – a few minutes later the music will have been ripped from your CD onto your hard drive.  Codecs galore – which ones to use? The  term  codec comes  from  a  combination  of  the  words  compression  and decompression. The name of the game with all codecs is to squeeze down, or compress,  digital  music  into  small  file  sizes  without  losing  too  much  sound quality.  All  the  clever  compressing  and  sampling  is  done  by  using  horribly  complex algorithms that profile the music track and take out bits of sound that aren’t  p m A r e w o p B d   91   The Downloader’s Handbook  necessary. How each of the codecs does this varies enormously. Some codecs, such as FLAC, are described as lossless because they retain the true multitude of  sounds  in  a  given  audio  track,  but  these  lossless  codecs  tend  to  produce much bigger files. Lossy codecs, by contrast, pick up all the main elements of the track but don’t sample every little nuance, and the size of the resulting file is much, much smaller.   Luckily, most ripping software packages – dBpowerAMP, Nero or Media Player – will  give  you  the  chance  to  save  ripped  music  with  a  choice  of  codecs, although most people will use either MP3 or the Windows WMA file format. But there are some other formats worth exploring.  In techno speak, this is known as ‘MPEG-1 Audio Layer-3’ and it’s by far the most popular compressed audio file format. An MP3 file is about one tenth the size of the original audio file, but the sound is nearly CD-quality. The system works by analysing the waveforms in the sound file and ignoring those that the human brain is poor at perceiving, and then compresses the rest. Because of their small size and good fidelity MP3 files have become a popular way to store music  files  on  both  computers  and  portable  devices.  It’s  worth  noting  that many  digital  aficionados  prefer  a  version  of  MP3  called  LAME, which  is  an open  file  at lame.sourceforge.net .  The  consensus   in  2006   seems  to  be  that  the  LAME version produces the highest quality MP3 files at average bitrates of 128 Kbit s and higher.   you  can  download   version  of  MP3   source  the   WMA files are Microsoft’s take on audio compression with a few added twists. Its big advantage is that it can compress music to even smaller files than MP3 without a significant decrease in sound quality. It also integrates easily with most major music players like Media Player and jetAudio  we’ll talk about these later in the chapter . The downside of WMA files is that they don’t always play on portable music players and it’s also heavily used by music websites that like to build in some form of copyright protection into their music. We’ll talk about this  copyright  malarkey  plus  DRM – Digital  Rights  Management  –  in  much  MP3  WMA  92   3 – Digital Music  greater detail in the next chapter, but suffice to say that protected WMA files can stop playing if the copyright holder decides you’ve violated their license terms  i.e. by playing it on a device they’re not happy with .   MP4  MPC  OGG  FLAC  MP4 or M4A or AAC. A worthy successor to MP3, MP4 is a container that can store  many  sub-formats,  of  which  the  most  popular   certainly  amongst  Mac users and iTunes fans  is Advanced Audio Compression  AAC . You might also encounter another format called .M4A – Apple’s lossless format  ALAC  – which is a bit like a zip file in that you lose no sound quality in the compression. There are also .M4B files, which are identical to .m4a except that iPod knows to use them as audio books and allows book marking.  MPC or Musepack MPEGplus is the king of lossy encoding. ‘Lossy’ as a term applies to any compression technique that ‘loses’ some of the audio file in the compression.  Musepack  works  brilliantly  at  compressing  but  takes  next  to nothing out of the audio track – the only downside is that the files can be quite big and most portable music players like iPods won’t play the format.   OGG,  or  OGG  Vorbis,  is  a  very  popular  free  encoder, which  produces compressed files that are of an appreciably better quality than MP3 and WMA, equal to M4A  AAC  and nearly, but not quite, as good as Musepack files. The resulting files tend to be larger than MP3 files, and smaller than Musepack files plus OGG has one last advantage – a growing number of portable music players will recognise the format.   You  might  also  run  into  yet  another  format  called  FLAC.  This  is  a  lossless compressor – this means that nothing is thrown away, unlike MP3, WMA and other similar lossy compression methods. FLAC files will only compress to a maximum ratio of 4:1 and a 3 minute track will take up about 30MB.   93   The Downloader’s Handbook  How do they compare? If you were about to pump your prized digital music through a ten thousand pound  Hi-Fi system  you  might  care  enormously  about  the  sound  quality.  In which  case,  the  FLAC  and  Musepack  formats  would  end  up  being  the undisputed winners. But these high quality codecs also produce large files and in most cases are, frankly, overkill.   I, like most people, use compressed music on my home computer – with rubbish speakers – and on the move with cheap portable music players and knackered headphones.  The  quality  of  the  music  is  important  but  nowhere  near  as important  as  how  many  tracks  I  can  fit  on  the  music  player.  In  these circumstances the heavily lossy formats like MP3, MP4 and WMA will tend to be quite satisfactory.   Tip: Make sure you set the sample rate  in Kbps  at a satisfactory level. For most people that should be above 64Kbps and for best results above 128Kbps.   The codec you use also depends on your PCs music player and your portable music  device.  Some  only  accept  MP3  formats,  although  a  few  smaller manufacturers also sell machines that will play OGG files. But let’s assume for arguments  sake that  you  do  manage  to  find  a  music  player  that  accepts  all these lossy formats – which codec to use?  The simple way of testing the efficiency of different codecs is to compare their compression rates. Let’s take a typical music track, in this case the superlative Grand Love Story by Kid Loco, and see how much we can compress the music track  without  appreciably  affecting  the  sound  quality. For  the  record,  the original length of the track is just over 5 minutes and on the CD the audio track takes up 41.866MB  uncompressed .  94   3 – Digital Music  41.866 5.73 5.69 1.9 5.86 3.316 7.604  Codec  Sample Rate   Frequency  File size in MB  Uncompressed 192 kbps   44 Hz 192kbps   44 Hz 64kbps   44 Hz 192 Hz  WAV  original  WMA 9.1 MP3  LAME  MP3  LAME  OGG Vorbis M4A   MP4 Musepack  Verdict  The MP3, 64 kbps version sounds a little ropey and hissy, although the file at 1.9MB is incredibly small, while the MP4 track sounds great and is only just under twice the size. The best sound of all comes from the Musepack file with OGG trailing a close second. The best all-rounder is probably the WMA file, which is relatively small  at 5.73MB  and still sounds great. But be aware that different  styles  of  music  might  produce  different  results.  Some  codecs,  like MP4, sound appreciably better with lighter classical music tracks for instance – and so the differences can be marginal at best. The bottom line is that MP4 produces good quality, very small files, while OGG produces a lovely rich sound but much bigger sized files – the best all-rounder in terms of both quality and file size is probably the WMA format, which produces good sound quality in relatively small file sizes.  95   The Downloader’s Handbook  Digital music players  Windows Media Player Now that we’ve learnt how to rip music from a CD, it’s time to start playing our digital music.   The  default  media  player   it  also  plays  film  and  music   has  to  be  Windows Media  Player,  currently  in  its  11th  incarnation.  If  you’ve  got  a  PC  with Microsoft  Windows  on  board  –  XP  or  Millennium  Edition  –  you’ll  almost certainly have it installed, even if you don’t actually want it!  Bundling  a  media  player  free  with  Windows,  however,  is  not  necessarily altruistic on the part of Microsoft. It’s all part of a very clearly defined strategy by Bill Gates and his bespectacled minions to lord it over the world of digital content by providing the default media player of most PCs. If all that sounds a bit  paranoid  then  consider  the  various  huge  legal  actions  by  competition authorities in both the US and Europe to stop Microsoft ‘bundling’ up Media Player in its suite of software.   There are more than a few sceptics who wonder whether Media Player is little more  than  just  a  handy  media  player  with  a  bunch  of  features  that  make  it useful, but far from indispensable. As you’re about to discover it’s great that you get these features for free, but there are better alternatives available for the more discerning digital music fan.   Still,  despite  these  reservations,  it  is  free  and  very  easy  to  use,  and  almost certainly sitting on your computer ready for action.   96   3 – Digital Music  Program profile – Windows Media Player  User What it is  Why bother  Source Difficulty How long will it  take to master  Beginner A sleek, powerful media player that works with  film and music It’s the biggest media player freely available on  all PCs with XP www.microsoft.com Very easy Ten minutes to half an hour for all the features  Tip: Get  the  upgrade  to  the  latest  Media  Player  right  away. Formats, codecs and content are changing at an astonishing rate and most media players struggle to keep up with all these changes. The only fix for this problem is to upgrade to the latest version as quick as possible. And this is certainly true for Media Player – get the latest version as soon as possible by visiting its sub-site at Microsoft at www.microsoft.com windows windowsmedia . Here  you’ll encounter one pleasant and one unpleasant surprise.  The pleasant surprise  To download the latest version you don’t have to run a small bit of software that  takes  an  inventory  of  your  existing  software  and  then  forces  you  to download loads of confusing options – as is the Microsoft way. Instead, you:       Click on ‘Download’. Save file to a place on your disk.   The unpleasant surprise  It’s a huge file. The last time I looked it was 12.1MB in total. Even on a fast 1Mbps broadband connection that’s a long download – probably ten minutes or more.  97   The Downloader’s Handbook  What to do with the downloaded file  First off, make sure you’re online when you install the download – the software will  need  to  go  to  the  internet  to  complete  various  registration  checks  and activate some add-ons.   Double click to launch the installation. Hit ‘Run’ when the Open File – Security Warning comes up.  The software will now extract all the relevant files and then present you with the main install window.  Windows Media Player – Welcome screen  t f o s o r c i M  m o r f  n o i s s i m r e p  h t i  w  d e t n i r p e r  t o h s  n e e r c s  t c u d o r p  t f o s o r c i M    r e y a p  l  l  i  , s e g o o n h c e t  i  ® a d e M s w o d n W  i  , n o i t a r o p r o C  Click  ‘I  Accept’.  The  installation  program  immediately  tries  to  go  online  to check the version of the software. After this it starts installing all the files and then it’s time to set your preferences.  98   Windows Media Player – Welcome screen during install  3 – Digital Music  t f o s o r c i M  m o r f  n o i s s i m r e p  h t i  w  d e t n i r p e r  t o h s  n e e r c s  t c u d o r p  t f o s o r c i M    r e y a p  l  l  i  , s e g o o n h c e t  i  ® a d e M s w o d n W  i  , n o i t a r o p r o C  99  Click ‘Next’.  You’re now presented with a number of very important options. Most of them are straightforward. Tick ‘Yes’ for the option to display information from the internet  it’s a nice feature that checks the data about each media file , and tick ‘Yes’ to send the file and URL history to the player.   Tick  ‘No’  to  Acquire  Licenses  automatically  for  protected  content.  You  don’t need to have this checked and, frankly, it’s none of Microsoft’s business what you play on your machine.   Tick  ‘No’  to  send  Unique  Player  Id  to  content  providers.  Why  should  you voluntarily sign up for someone snooping on your music collection – I refused and so should you.   Selecting a default media player  The next screen is also hugely important. It lets you set the default preferences for  various  media  formats  –  music  and  video.  You  can,  at  Microsoft’s prompting,  tick  them  all.  This  means  virtually  all  major  media  files  will   The Downloader’s Handbook  automatically  load  up  Media  Player.  If  you  intend  to  carry  on  using  Media Player  exclusively,  for  eternity,  click  them  all.  If  you’d  rather  use  more specialist players for different types of content, unclick them all. Remember, whenever you load digital content your operating system will ask you which program  to  use  anyway,  so  you’ll  always  have  a  choice.  Personally  my preference  is  to  click  ‘Yes’  to  any  files  that  are  based  on  Windows  Media formats  like WMA or WMV  plus the AVI and more obscure files like Midi or AIFF. But in my experience there are better programs that play DVDs and CDs. The choice, though, is yours.  Click ‘Finish’.   An icon will probably now appear on your desktop and Media Player will go online again to validate your settings  if it does and your firewall comes up asking you for instructions, let it through and click the box to remember this instruction .  Time to start playing with Media Player  t f o s o r c i M  m o r f  n o i s s i m r e p  h t i  w  d e t n i r p e r  t o h s  n e e r c s  t c u d o r p  t f o s o r c i M    r e y a p  l  l  i  , s e g o o n h c e t  i  ® a d e M s w o d n W  i  , n o i t a r o p r o C  The Main Media Player screen  100   3 – Digital Music  The Library – setting it up  Most newcomers to Media Player are advised to start off with the Library.  Look on the top left hand of the screen and you’ll see Library as a tab.   When you first go to this section you’ll be prompted to search your computer for files. You don’t have to do this  you can just launch this file searching process through the tools menu  but in my opinion it’s a useful feature, so say ‘Yes’.  If  you  have  drives  both  inside  your  computer  and  externally   Firewire or network drives for instance  you should probably specify All Drives on the next screen,  which  asks  you  where  to  search.  Then  click  to  start  the  search.  This clever  little  utility  now  goes  away  and  searches  through  all  your  drives  and indexes all your music files, building up a formidable database of content.  Using the Library  Your next priority is to organise your music collection so that you know what’s where. The good old-fashioned way was to simply put all the music files in the right folders and then order them alphabetically in a big section called MUSIC somewhere on your hard drive. Media Player’s Library offers a typically elaborate alternative to this – it builds a huge database of files, which are then organised via their ID Tags. There are four main ways of categorising digital music.  Title     Artist   Album   Genre  The  first  three,  I  think,  are  fairly  straightforward  but  the  last  is  a  curious parvenu. Most American software and websites love this curious term, genre – it’s supposed to help guide the poor consumer through the tricky business of what’s Rock, or more specifically Alt Rock, or even more specifically Alt adult Oriented Rock with an Armenian trip hop flavour. Frankly, I find the whole thing a bit silly as most of the music I like doesn’t fit into any nice, easy to define category  somewhere between LoFi, Trip Hop and Progressive Rock apparently , but still it’s obviously useful as millions of people seem to organise their music collections on this basis. I organize my music by clicking on the heading which says Album – this automatically sorts all the content by the album name.   101   The Downloader’s Handbook  Playlists  The option of using the Library function to scour your music collection and then  organise  it  also  brings  with  it  one  other  advantage  –  it  organises  your playlists.  Playlists are handy little files that tell a media player to play a certain number of music files in a certain order. Most good ripping software will take the music on a CD and then dump down a little playlist text file  many are called M3Us  which  organises  the  music.  That  means  when  you  play  the  music  on,  say,  a portable MP3 player, the playlist file will tell the player to run the files in the correct order.   Playlists are also useful if you want to generate new compilations and Media Player has a handy playlist function built into it. On the left hand side of the main  player  window  you’ll  see  a  series  of  choices  starting  with  ‘All  Music’. Further down you’ll see ‘My Playlists’.      If you want to build a new playlist compilation Right Click on your mouse and you’ll see an option that says New. Click on New.    On  the  far  right  side  you’ll  see  a  new  box column  appear  headed  New Playlist.  Inside  this  box  you  can  now  place  your  selected  music  files  in whatever order you want. The simplest way to do this is to look back to the left hand side again, click on all music, pick out tracks for the compilation and then drag and drop them inside our New Playlist box.    When you’ve got all your files in the right order you can then play them all  holding down ‘Shift’, click on all the files and then right click ‘Play’ .   Alternatively you can save this playlist for future use, say at a party. Put the cursor over the box at the top that says New Playlist and then click. You’ll see a number of options one of which is Save Playlist As. This allows you  to  save  the  playlist  in  whatever  format  you  want   Windows  Media Playlist or M3U . The default storage location is probably the best though – inside  a  file  called  My  Playlists  inside  My  Music  which  is  in  My Documents.     Want a two hour long party playlist? All you have to do now is build the compilation, save the playlist inside a selected folder and then right click the playlist file itself and hit ‘Play’.   102   3 – Digital Music  The playlist alternative – DioneSS Playlist Editor  Playlists are an absolutely indispensable tool for serious music lovers. They save you the bother of having to constantly click play for each music file you want to listen to and they also let you build up some very  cool  compilations.  Every  major  music  player  like  Microsoft’s Media  Player  and  Apple’s  iTunes  we’ll  run  into  this  in  the  next chapter  will use and compile a playlist of some sorts. But they’re not necessarily  the  most  efficient  way  of  batch  compiling  dozens  of playlists in one go.  Thankfully, there’s a great, free alternative that can quickly, and easily, build  playlists.  It’s  called  DioneSS  Playlist  and  it’s  available  at http:  homepage.ntlworld.com thorin92 dss . As  freeware goes  it’s wonderful, mainly because it’s not made by Microsoft or Apple, doesn’t care what files or formats you want to use  even if they’re called weird things like OGG  and is incredibly simple to use.   Playing music   Now that you’ve organised your growing collection of digital music, it’s time to actually play the stuff.   Media Player is admirably straightforward – the easiest way is to choose the music  files or playlists  from the Library and then right click on the selected tracks and select play. If you want to select multiple tracks just hold down the Shift button while clicking on the files.  The music will now start playing along with some rather funky visualisations. Opinion  on  these  varies  but  you  do  have  plenty  of  choice  –  in  the  basic installation  there  are  eight  schemes  plus  the  option  of  simply  displaying  the album cover as a JPEG image file. You can access these choices by clicking on the little button on the top left hand of the screen with three small lines and a downward facing small green arrow. You can also call up further enhancements that include a graphic equaliser and add-ons like DSP sound processing systems.   You can also choose which skin your music will play in. The main screen is a little  on  the  large  side  and  for  most  people  they’ll  be  playing  music  in  the background – a smaller, funkier skin is probably more useful. These come in all  103   The Downloader’s Handbook  sorts of designs – sci-fi consoles come as standard but you can download a huge number of alternatives.   Media Player with sci-fi like skin  Ripping and burning using Media Player  Clever old Microsoft has done everything in its power to make sure that Media Player provides all the key tools that any serious digital music fan should ever require and that means it also boasts a number of rip and burn features.   Let’s start with the ripping facility.  t f o s o r c i M  m o r f  n o i s s i m r e p  h t i  w  d e t n i r p e r  t o h s  n e e r c s  t c u d o r p  t f o s o r c i M   r e y a p  l  i  l  , s e g o o n h c e t  i  ® a d e M s w o d n W  i  , n o i t a r o p r o C  104   3 – Digital Music       Insert a CD in the drive and then open up Media Player. Click on the ‘Rip’ tab. You’ll now see the music tracks listed, hopefully with all the music information. If the details of the album are not listed simply hit the Find Album Info button and Media Player will go online to one of the music databases and retrieve the information.     You’re now ready to rip the music. If this is the first time you’ve done this using Media Player you may see a new screen come up that gives you the option of adding copyright protection to the ripped tracks. Click on the ‘Do Not Add Copy’ protection and click on the ‘I understand‘ box.        Next you’ll be asked it you want to use the pre-configured settings or use  your own. Personally I’d select your own options.  n o i t a r o p r o C  t f o s o r c i M m o r f  n o i s s i m r e p  h t i  w d e t n i r p e r  t o h s  n e e r c s  t c u d o r p  t f o s o r c i M      If you do decide to set your own options you’ll be presented with a number of different choices. First you can set-up where you rip your music too – in most cases this is best left as My Music within My Documents.  105   The Downloader’s Handbook    You  can  also  tell  Media  Player  which  codec  to  use  for  compression. Windows Media Audio is selected as standard. Personally, I’d change that to MP3 because it’s the more widely used format and is guaranteed to play on nearly every portable music player.  Click ‘Apply’ and then ‘OK’ and you’ll be back at the main Rip screen. Now it’s  time  to  hit  the  ‘Rip’  button  in  the  top  right  hand  side  of  the  screen. Media Player will now take a little over 30 seconds to rip each and every track. When it’s finished it will eject the CD.      Burning music onto a CD  Media Player can also convert MP3 and WMA files back into WAV files that can  be  burned  onto  a  CD  for  use  in  Hi-Fi systems   assuming  you  have  a CD DVD player that can burn discs .      Click on the ‘Burn’ button on the main screen.  t f o s o r c i M  m o r f  n o i s s i m r e p  h t i  w  d e t n i r p e r  t o h s  n e e r c s  t c u d o r p  t f o s o r c i M  r e y a p  l  i  l  , s e g o o n h c e t  i  ® a d e M s w o d n W  i  , n o i t a r o p r o C      Media  Player  suggests  using  playlists  listed  in  its  Library  as  a  way  of building up the files on the left hand side of the screen – the files to be burnt onto a CD. Frankly there’s a much easier way – simply open up the folder in which your music is stored through My Computer and then drag and drop the files into the left hand – Burn List – box.   106   3 – Digital Music     Insert a blank CD in the drive and then hit ‘Start Burn’. Media Player will now  convert  all  the  files  to  WAV  format  and  then  burn  the  CD.  The conversion itself will take a couple of minutes while the burn will take five to ten minutes depending on the speed of your CD DVD unit.   jetAudio As an alternative to Microsoft Media Player, the pick of the bunch by far is a wonderful program called jetAudio  you can get it free at www.jetaudio.com . This enormously clever and stylish piece of software was originally designed by an electronics manufacturer called Cowon as a useful add-on for its MP3 music players  that are heavily advertised on its website . To get the software simply click on the ‘Download’ button and choose jetAudio Basic  there is a paid-for version  that  is  very  powerful,  but  completely  unnecessary  for  most  music aficionados .

It also incorporates a number of nifty player features like a graphic equaliser controller and it comes pre-loaded with extra tools that allow you to rip and burn a CD, plus conversion back and forward between different codecs.   107   The Downloader’s Handbook  i  o d u A t e j    If you want to play some music you have a number of options. First, you can build up a music library by hitting the Album button. This launches a new box called Album Manager, which lets you build up the library of tracks that Jet draws from. To add multiple files simply click second folder symbol  the one with three folders stacked together  and then select the folders plus sub-folders you want to add to your collection. When you’re complete, simply double click on the file s  you want to play, and Jet will start up.  You can also select individual tracks or whole folders by clicking on the open files button on the main control pad. You’ll now see the funky graphic equaliser screen power up – the music as a waveform. You can either choose to leave the levels set at Flat or select the music style that’s most appropriate.  If you click on the Visual button  top right hand side above the time counter  you can  also  select  visualisations  to  run  alongside  the  music.  My  personal favourite  is  Pixel  Trip,  but  you  can  add  other  visualisations  from  the Cowan jetAudio website.   jetAudio boasts one very nice extra feature: an automatic fade up and down when playing new tracks. This is altogether a nicer way of playing tracks and comes as a default option in jetAudio.  108   3 – Digital Music  jetAudio also comes with all the standard rip and burn features that are found in Windows Media Player.   First, let’s access the rip tools. Insert a CD in your PC and then click on the Rip screen.  jetAudio – Ripping  You’ll now see the main Rip set-up box. Your key decision here is whether to rip the tracks as WMA files  the default , or OGG or even Musepack. You’ll also notice that there’s no MP3 choice available – as this is the free version of the software, Cowon Jet can’t afford to pay out for the license that allows them to use  the  MP3  codec,  although  the  advanced  paid-for  version  does  have  this option. When you’re ready hit ‘Start’.  i  o d u A t e j    109   The Downloader’s Handbook  The Burn tool is also very easy to use. Again, insert a blank CD you want to burn on, click on ‘Burn’ and you’ll see a new box appear. You can now add the files you want to put on your CDs simply by using the Add Files box. When you’re added all your files simply hit ‘Start’.  jetAudio – Creating  i  o d u A t e j    110   3 – Digital Music  jetAudio boasts one other marvellous extra feature – a conversion tool that lets you move back and forward between most codecs, which is a great feature if you want to move between say WMA and the OGG format. To use it simply click on the ‘Conversion’ tab, select ‘Convert’ Audio and then find the tracks you want to convert from through the main Conversion window. Click on the ‘Add Files’ button and select some MP3 tracks, and then at the bottom of the screen select which codec you want to convert to – these range from Musepack through to WMA but again doesn’t include MP3.  jetAudio – Converting  i  o d u A t e j    111   The Downloader’s Handbook  Winamp The main alternative to Jet amongst experienced users is Winamp, a powerful but relatively easy to use program that lets you do everything Windows Media Player does and more.

Setting up a playlist  Now  the  program  will  open.  To listen  to  a  track  you  need  to  add  it  to  the playlist. By default, the playlist window will be open but the windows have a habit  of  being  accidentally  closed.  To  open  the  playlist  window,  either  click ‘View’ then ‘Playlist Editor’, click the button labelled ‘PL’ at the bottom right of the main window or press ‘Alt+E’.   112   Winamp – Playlists  3 – Digital Music  p m a n W   i  Click  ‘Add’  in  the  window  labelled  Playlist  Editor, then  select  ‘Add  file s ’  or press ‘L’.  Now a browse window will open; from here you can select the file s  that you want to open. Once selected, click ‘Open’.  The file s  will then be displayed in the Playlist Editor window. To play one, double click it. Alternatively, if you keep a selection of music that you want to play already in a single folder then you can add the entire contents by clicking ‘Add’ then ‘Add Folder’ or press ‘Shift+L’. This will open a window from where you can browse for the folder to open.  To save  a  playlist,  click  ‘Manage  Playlist’  then  ‘Save  Playlist’  or  ‘Ctrl+S’.  To open a playlist, click ‘Manage Playlist’ then ‘Open Playlist’ or ‘Ctrl+O’.

Click the Audio link under the Local Media on the left of the window. You will be  prompted  to  add  files  to  the  library.  Do  this  as  though  you  were  adding folders to a playlist. Once you’ve finished adding all your music click ‘Close’ on the pop-up.  Next you’ll notice all your artists and albums are listed in the main part of the window. Select an artist or album that you want to listen to and the tracks will be displayed in the lower part of the window along with some web information about it.

Under Online  Media  is  a  choice  of  Shoutcast  Radio,  Shoutcast  TV,  Winamp Music, Winamp Video  and  AOL  Video.  The  Winamp Music,  Winamp Video  and  AOL Video  give  you  a  small  variety  of  either  music,  music  videos  or  TV  snippets, designed to make you want to buy more. However, the Shoutcast radio and TV is entirely free content from an array of radio servers. To stream anything from any of the categories just select it and, after a couple of seconds, a list will appear in the main part of the window with all the available streams from that category. The first time you do this you will be asked for content ratings. Select the ratings that you want, check the ‘Do not show me this again’ box and click ‘Close’.

Portable MP3 players I thought I should also include a mention of portable MP3 players, although this book is mainly about playing digital media on PCs.  Despite all the hype and excitement generated by Planet iPod, it’s easy to forget the simple fact that only about 20% of the UK population has some kind of portable music player using either MP3 playback or Apple’s variant based on MP4.  Which is a pity, because a portable MP3 player is fantastic – if you have the right one. Or two or even three!  Even  if  you  have  an  MP3  player,  what’s  to  stop  you  buying  another  one? Maybe you could have a really small device  possibly flash based  for normal day to day stuff and a larger capacity one for travelling?  And if you’re in the majority that hasn’t even got one single MP3 player yet, you really need to get one – now!  Portable MP3 players are falling in price all the time and the technology is getting better and better; but do remember that not all MP3 players are created equal.  What to look for in an MP3 player 1. DRM – Digital Rights Management  In the good old days, you downloaded music as an MP3 track and then copied it across to an MP3 player with no worries about clever software that  controls  the  copyright.  Those  days  are  long  gone.  You  need  to  take great care in working out if your music player has the appropriate rights protection or DRM. The biggest problem is that music purchased from the Apple iTunes music store won’t play on anything but an iPod. So don’t buy anything but an iPod if you’re planning to shop at iTunes. Also, services like Napster restrict the number of music devices their music will play on – look  for  mention  of  DRM protection  built  in  and  check  on  Napster’s website to see if your player is compatible. If it isn’t, music purchased on Napster  or MSN Music for that matter  won’t play on your MP3 player.  116   3 – Digital Music  2. Format  Most music players will play MP3 and WMA  the Microsoft format ; while iPods will play the Apple MP4 format as well as MP3 and WMA. But the vast  majority  of  MP3  players  won’t  play  Apple’s  formats.  Beyond  these hugely popular formats, it gets even trickier. A good player will also use OGG files – they’re good quality, but the files are much, much bigger than MP4 or MP3. Do try to find a player with OGG support if at all possible. Also, the ability to play WMA though common is not global – make sure your player will play this format as well.  3. Capacity  Most players fall into one of three major categories. Small capacity players will  typically  play  up  to  2GB  with  storage  capacity  starting  at  64MB. 128MB is probably the absolute minimum  this will equate to an average of around 20 tracks at acceptable encoding rates ; while 256MB is a happy medium  40 to 50 tracks . These smaller capacity players will tend to use flash memory, rather than PC-based hard drives – that makes them light and cheap, but it caps capacity at a few GBs. Mid-sized players start at 1GB and go up to about 6GB. They have enough capacity for hundreds of tracks and are also, usually, quite small. But they’re also more expensive – you won’t get much change from £100. The high capacity players start at 20GB and use proper PC-based hard drives, can carry thousands of tracks and are great for travel and holidays, but they can end up being a bit bulky. They also tend to be pretty expensive, with most decent models made by iRiver, Creative, Apple and Archos starting at £150.  4. Power  5. Screens  Good players will give you at least 6 hours run time on either one small AAA battery  typical of the small capacity flash drives , or a single lithium ion  recharge.  Above  10 hours  is  great  and  below  3  hours  is  bad. Rechargeable lithium ion batteries are a great idea but tend to give you less hours  of  usage,  while  AAA  batteries  work  out  more  expensive  over  the longer term but tend to feature in much cheaper devices that typically cost under £50.  Manufacturers love to brag about their amazing all singing, all dancing, colour screens, but if you only play music, colour is not really necessary.  117   The Downloader’s Handbook  What is necessary is that the display gives you basic track information with at least three lines of data  enough for album, artist and track name .  6. Playlists  7. Weight  These are a wonderful innovation and allow you to edit together your own ‘Best Of’ compilations. But most cheap MP3 players won’t be able to handle these little text files  typical file formats end with M3U . They also tell the machine to play the music in a specified order, otherwise the player will revert  to  playing  tracks  starting  with  names  beginning  with  ‘A’  or  the number 1.  I used to buy heavier jukebox like MP3 players  equivalent to iPods  but stopped  recently. I found  them  heavy  to  lug  around  and  expensive  to replace.  If,  like me,  you’re  a  bit  absent-minded,  spending  hundreds  of pounds on a bulkier MP3 player with loads of features is overkill and a possible waste of money. Most of you will probably only want access to, say, 40-100 tracks on the move at the same time, which suggests buying a smaller   in  weight  terms   capacity  player  that  is  also  much  cheaper  – ideally look for 1GB in capacity that costs less than £100 and also plays DRM music from the likes of Napster. Heavier players are wonderful if you travel  extensively,  but  for  most  of  us  a  light  player  will  do.  In  fact,  the smaller the better.  8. Music software  The manufacturers of MP3 players love to brag about the amazing things you can do with your player and their special software. For example, they’ll tell you about the fabulous possibilities of syncing tracks between your PC and MP3 player in nano seconds, courtesy of software provided by the likes of MusicMatch. Forget it. It’s all a big waste of time, except if you’ve got an iPod. You should use your device as a simple, portable hard disk device. When it plugs into the PC you can drag and drop files simply by treating it as another hard drive by accessing it through the My Computer icon. It’s all simple and easy using XP’s Plug and Play capability. The big exception is the iPod where it does make sense to use its bundled software  you don’t have a lot of choice, in truth  although you can still use the device as a simple plug-and-play hard drive.  118   3 – Digital Music  9. Headphones  10. Cost  Not  all  headphones  are  created  equal,  although  nearly  all  headphones supplied by MP3 player manufacturers are  usually  equally dreadful. In my experience it’s frequently worth paying less for the MP3 player and a bit more for the headphones. Good ones by the likes of Shure or Sennheiser are really very, very good.  The sixty four thousand dollar question – the answer to which I’ve already hinted at earlier on. Personally, I wouldn’t dream of spending more than £100 on a portable player in case I lost it. There are some great players above  this  price,  but  I’d  be  too  worried  about  losing  it   and  lugging  it about . You may be different, but think about this: for £50 you should be able to buy a perfectly good player that plays more than 50 tracks, weighs next to nothing and plays most main formats. If you lose it it’ll be a pain but you should be able to afford another one in an emergency. If you insist on spending more than £100 make sure it’s fully equipped with DRM, it handles  as  many  formats  as  possible  and  has  a  good  screen  and  decent battery life.  Internet radio and streaming audio As we’ll discover in this book the availability of digital music is by no means limited  to  your  CD  collection.  There  are,  online,  literally  dozens  of  different networks that allow you to download music files over the internet – some of them entirely legally, some of them less so. These networks – like Napster for instance – involve some kind of download delivery system, which means that a piece of extra software sitting on your computer tells it where to find a music file and then download it to the right place on your computer.  But downloading isn’t the only game in the digital music town. There’s a widely used  alternative  called  audio  streaming.  This  involves  a  technology  that  is effectively a kind of internet radio. Instead of downloading a whole file, your computer receives small packets of data that are put back together by a piece of software in your computer as one continuous real-time stream.   119   The Downloader’s Handbook  This  audio  streaming technology  is  used  to  greatest  affect  by  internet  radio stations such as Live365 and the BBC.   Live365 Live365.com is the mother of all internet radio stations. It acts as a central hub for literally thousands of free radio stations from all over the planet, that in turn play every conceivable style of music known.   Live365 – Front page  m o c . 5 6 3 e v L   i  Live365, like many internet radio stations, uses its own software to play the music  over  the  internet.  Some  networks  have  used  third  party  programs, Microsoft’s Media Player or the Real Networks player  we’ll run into this with the BBC , but Live365 does away with these and has built into its website its own player that pops up as a separate screen when you click on a radio station.   Listening to Live365  To listen to internet radio, all you have to do is select the kind of music you want,  and  the  station  that  best  suits  your  musical  tastes,  then  click  on  the ‘Listen’ button next to the radio station listing, and then the player window pops up.  120   3 – Digital Music  As you’ve chosen the free version of Live365, you’ll now have to put up with the highly annoying radio advert – these last about five to ten seconds – and then, hey presto, you’re listening to your specialist Tibetan Goat Herding music station.   Tip: The Live365 Professional stations are only available if you pay an annual or monthly subscription, but they boast better audio quality and no annoying ads.  BBC The BBC also has an enormous wealth of audio content; both music based and spoken  word   Radio  4  is  especially  strong  on  documentaries  and  current affairs . Thankfully, the BBC is one of the most technologically advanced media corporations on planet Earth and has moved heaven and earth to make sure that its most successful radio stations and programmes are available online.  The model here is a slightly different one in that it’s actually closer to download technology – though some live radio shows are available in real time on the internet,  the  most  popular  programmes  are  actually  library  download  copies that are available via a streaming network.  So far so wonderful – it’s all free content and you don’t have any annoying adverts.   The BBC downside  All the BBC’s radio content uses a codec based on technology devised by Real Networks.  Real  was  one  of  the  pioneers  of  streaming technology  and  has successfully  survived  the  onslaught  of  mighty  Microsoft  by  developing proprietary player software that is still immensely popular with streaming radio stations. The only problem is that I see no earthly reason why you need any of Real’s  software.  Its  player  is,  in  my  experience  at  least,  buggy  and  drains system resources and there are also loads of annoying ads. Apart from internet radio stations you really don’t need any other tools built into its software.  121   But BBC Radio has, sadly, tied itself to Real and that means whenever you click on their Radio Player it will try and use the Real software that’s supposed to be installed on your PC.   The Downloader’s Handbook  But there is an alternative!   Real Alternative  Its called, unsurprisingly, the Real Alternative. To download it simply type in the software name to any major search engine and you’ll be taken to any one of the dozens of sites that host this free software. This gem doesn’t install any of  this  Real  Player  nonsense  on  your  computer,  but  instead  uses  a  small program  called  Media  Player  Classic  that  installs  all  the  necessary  codecs without any of the spyware system hungry player software.  Once you’ve installed this Real Alternative you can now click on any of BBC Radio’s stations and you’ll see its Radio Player pop-up as part of a web page. The BBC has also put a small number of its spoken word radio programmes into an online library. If you’re into history and science for instance, the wonderful ‘In Our Time’ has made sure that all its past programmes are in an archive – available at:  www.bbc.co.uk radio4 history inourtime inourtime_archive_home.shtml  If you like the look of a particular programme simply double click on it and you’ll  see  the  Media  Player  Classic  screen  appear.  After  a  few  seconds  of buffering  –  this  involves  your  computer  contacting  the  host  computer  and downloading the start of a stream – the programme should play.  122   BBC Radio Player  3 – Digital Music  Recording music and speech using your PC Internet  radio  is  a  wonderful  innovation,  but  what  happens  if  you  want  to record a favourite programme onto your PC in the same way you record your favourite TV programmes using a VCR?  Time to acquaint yourself with two rather wonderful programs. The first is a paid-for piece of software called Audio Recorder Pro, the second a free program that is a must for all music buffs called Audacity.  Audio Recorder Pro Audio Recorder Pro is one of a number of software programs that allow you to record streaming music and speech through your computer. It’s not necessarily the most high powered or even the cheapest of programs, but it works, is easy to use and comes with a number of very useful tools that are invaluable for recording audio streams.

The one downside is that it’s not free. It  costs £15 www.snapfiles.com get ezaudiorecorder.html Easy A few minutes at most  Download  the  trial  Audio  Recorder  Pro software  from  its  website at www.snapfiles.com get ezaudiorecorder.html. The  paid-for  version  costs  $25  approx. £15  and is well worth the money.  Install  as  normal  and  then  launch  the  program.  You’ll  see  a  main  window appear – before you start using it you need to make sure you’ve selected the right audio source. Click on the ‘Source’ box and you’ll see a number of options appear, make sure you’ve selected ‘Stereo Mix’.  Now it’s time to find a radio station on the web. When you’ve selected your stream, head back to Audio Recorder Pro.   124   Audio Recorder Pro – Main screen  3 – Digital Music  Let’s record 45 minutes of a radio programme on to our PC  Audio Recorder Pro will turn the music that’s coming out of your PC speakers into an MP3 track which can then be played back whenever you want – or can even be burnt onto a CD.  Click on ‘Auto Record’ and you’ll see a new box appear which gives you the opportunity to run the program for a specified number of minutes  or hours . First make sure that the enable ‘Auto Stop’ function is ticked and then increase the ‘recording by length’ to 45 minutes. You can also use this box to schedule future recordings by using the Auto Start option. When you’re ready hit ‘OK’ and go back to the main screen.  . c n I  , c i g a M  t f o S  Z E   125   The Downloader’s Handbook  Audio Record pro – Auto start options  Now it’s time to make sure that the MP3 track we’re recording is of the right quality. Click on the ‘Output Quality’ button and a new box appears below the main  window. Here  you  can  control  the  settings  for  this  recording  session. Personally I use the MP3 format and the highest quality setting  HiFi  with a bitrate setting of at least 192 if not 320. This will produce a much bigger MP3 file but it will be of very high quality.   You also need to make sure that the source audio is not too noisy i.e. the audio levels  aren’t  too  high.  On  the  main  screen  you’ll  see  the  two  peak  level indicators flashing first green and then red. If they’re always red, your track will sound distorted. To lower the audio level inputs drag the two slider arrows down to an acceptable level.  After you’ve done this it’s time to tell the program where we want to save the MP3 file to – look for a small Disk icon. Next to this you’ll see another small box called Output. Type in the name of the file and then click on the Disc icon and save it to My Music  or wherever you save your music files .  You can, if you want, add an ID3 tag to the file for future media players to read. Click on the ID3 tag and you’ll see another window appear where you can fill out all the boxes  remembering to tick the ‘Write MP3 ID3 Tag’ box .  126   Audio Record pro – Output quality management  3 – Digital Music  The Audacity alternative There is a free alternative to Audio Recorder Pro called Audacity. It’s important to understand that Audacity is not specifically designed for recording internet audio streams – it’s a hugely powerful, all purpose audio mixing and recording program that’s widely used by music buffs that can also be used to record safe audio streams.

Audacity isn’t  the  easiest  piece  of software to understand but it’s actually a lot easier than its main screen looks. Go to your internet radio station so that you can hear music or speech coming through your speakers.   127   The Downloader’s Handbook  Audacity – Main screen  y t i c a d u A   After you’ve installed the software open up the program – you’ll see a big grey screen.  On the main toolbar  towards the top of the screen and below the buttons  you should see a box that says Stereo Mix. This allows you to set the audio input – in our case through the sound card.  Click on the small microphone button on the top right hand side of the screen. You should now see the audio levels go up and down with the music  or audio  coming through your speakers.  Now  it’s  time  to  record  this  audio  output.  Click  on  the  red  ‘Record’  button. You’ll  now  see  a  wave  form  diagram  appear.  Audacity is  now  taking  in  the audio signal and what you’re seeing is the real time monitoring of what you’re recording.  When  you’ve  finished  recording  the  audio music  stream  simply  click  on  the yellow ‘Stop’ button. Now it’s time to save the audio track in the right format on the right place on your hard drive. Click on ‘File’, and choose ‘Export’ as – you have the choice of either WAV, MP3 or OGG.   128   3 – Digital Music  Having  chosen  one  of  these  formats  to  export  as,  you’re  then  prompted  to choose the location of the file and give it a name. A five minute track should take no more than 20 seconds to export and save.   The downside – there’s no timer to control the recording  Audacity, like many freeware programs, looks complicated at first, but is in fact blindingly simple to use. But this ease – and the fact that it’s free – comes with one small problem for recording audio streams; namely you don’t have a timer to control the recording.  To see why this might be a bit of disadvantage, consider a radio broadcast of 45  minutes.  With  Audacity you  have  to  set  the  stream  going  and  then  hit Record and then remember to come back in 45 minutes and hit Stop! Now for many people that’s not really too much of a problem, but for absent-minded souls  such as myself  it’s a problem. Which is why I tend to use Audio Recorder Pro and its Timer features. Still, Audacity can do so much more than just record audio streams – you can also use it to edit music tracks and compile big mix compilations.  In this chapter we got to grips with ripping music from CDs, what codecs are all about, and what software to use to listen to digital music on your computer. We also looked at how to record internet radio and speech. Next up, where to find music tracks on the internet to download.  129    4  Online Music Services    4 – Online Music Services  It’s time to put all this knowledge of music players and codecs to work, and head out online to see what music you can download using the internet.  In  this  chapter  I’ll  first  walk  you  through  the  two  big  UK-based  services available online – the iTunes store and Napster. As you’ll soon discover they both  have  their  advantages  and  disadvantages,  but  they’re  both  powerful online music libraries that should satisfy all but the most discerning of music fans.  But don’t be fooled into thinking that your only choice is iTunes versus Napster.   There are some fantastic alternatives out there, not least from high street names like Virgin and HMV. And if alternative music like indie rock or jazz is your thing,  you  should  also  think  about  using  the  wonderful  Wippit and  eMusic. There’s even a niche service that caters to audio book enthusiasts – it’s called Audible and its online service has just launched in the UK.  But first you need to get your head around a terrible acronym that’s becoming more and more of a problem for online music fans. It’s called DRM and it’s a powerful set of software-based tools used by the music industry to control the way you play and edit music purchased online.  You’re about to discover that in this brave new world of legal, paid-for digital music you are not free to do whatever you want with your music!  In this chapter you’ll learn how to:    Use the iTunes music player and download music from the iTunes  music store.    Sign on and use the Napster service.   Access the superb eMusic online service.   Work with the Audible audio books service.  133   The Downloader’s Handbook  The world of DRM Unless you’ve been living on a deserted tropical island with no access to world news, you’ve probably heard about all the rows over copyright and the internet. In a later chapter we’ll talk in much greater detail about your legal position when it comes to downloading digital music and films, but for now let’s make a couple of bold assertions:  1. Broadband and  the  growth  of  the  internet  has  actually  put  you,  the consumer,  in  a  worse  position  as  a  user  of  copyrighted  material.  In  the supposedly bad old days of analogue tapes and vinyl you had more power and  more  flexibility  to  do  what  you  wanted  with  your  music.  Digital technology has actually reduced your flexibility to use this material.  2. Digital copyright technologies are not there to help you. They are there to  hinder you and protect the music industry’s ownership of their music.   Let’s explain both of these overuse.   First I have to declare that I am no digital socialist. I passionately believe in the right of people who hold rights over a property to exploit them. Music is a piece of property, intellectual property nonetheless, just like any other traded thing. If you copy it and then give it to everyone else for free in perpetuity that is a form of theft.  But there is also something called fair use. If I buy a music CD then I should be able to do what I want with that music CD, as long as I’m using it for my own purposes. If I want to copy it to a tape or to another CD, or into a digital form which is then put on a hard disk and played by anyone in my household, that is not theft. It is simple fair use.  Except that according to many, but not all, in the music industry, it isn’t.   With legitimate online digital services you only buy a license to use that music on the conditions set by the publisher. So if they say you can’t play it on any portable MP3 player that they haven’t agreed to, so be it. Your music is now disabled. If they don’t want you to copy the music and convert it to whatever format you want, then you can’t.  134   4 – Online Music Services  A very brief history of recording  To get inside the mindset of these intellectual property hawks cast your mind back to the bad good old days  depending on how you look at it  of VHS. When the first VHS recorder was introduced the film industry fought it every step. They  didn’t  want  any  technology  in  existence  that  could  in  any  way  copy anything that ever went on TV. Initially, they fought any copying facility, then they  moderated  their  position  by  accepting  that  VHS  manufacturers  could design a machine that would only copy one programme film once and then it would freeze up and stop playing. How useful!  Needless to say, VHS manufacturers were not too enthused by this restriction so  they  fought  it  through  the  courts.  And  won!  Recordable  VHS  tapes  were born and the film industry eventually made billions by flogging us loads of VHS films. With this mindset, you can see why the music industry reacted so badly to digital music – it put the fear of God in them!  But eventually they moderated their position and allowed us mere consumers to get music online through various music stores. But in doing so they built clever technologies that stop us from using our music freely  though there are exceptions like eMusic .   This practically means they can tell us how often we play our music, on what machines we play it and for how long and for what fee. The system that’s used to do this is called Digital Rights Management.   The proper legal technical definition of Digital Rights Management  or DRM  goes something like this:  “It’s an umbrella term that refers to any of several technical methods used to control or restrict the use of digital media content on electronic devices with such technologies installed.”  The  media  most  often  restricted  by  DRM techniques  include  music,  visual artwork and movies.   DRM effectively gives you no real legal right to fair use at all. It all depends on the largesse of the network owner and some are more generous than others. The actual  tools  used  to  implement  DRM doesn’t  really  need  to  bother  you,  but there are a number of practical implications.  135   The Downloader’s Handbook  Practical implications of DRM  1. Different digital music networks favour different music codecs. Microsoft loves its own WMA format but accepts MP3, along with Napster, but Apple only sells AAC based tracks through its iTunes store. Converting back and forth  between  these  formats  is  not  easy  and  in  many  cases  technically illegal.  2. You do not have fair use to transfer your files how you want to. Most DRM schemes will try and restrict the computers you can use your music on and the portable devices you listen to your music on.  3. There  is  also  a  clear  attempt  to  stop  you  using  music  if  you  no  longer subscribe to certain services. Napster in the UK may only charge less than a tenner a month to access its huge library, but as soon as you stop paying, your access to your downloaded music on your PC vanishes.  4. Last,  but   in  my  book   by  no  means  least,  this  DRM effectively  stops globalisation. Software has been built into computer servers on the internet that will recognise what country you’re coming from – if you’re from the UK  that  means  you  can’t  access  US-based  services  even  though  they’re cheaper. So you can import their CDs using various internet services but you can’t use their music services.  If you can live with all of this – and most people can – there is one final point worth considering: cost. Why bother downloading? At the end of this chapter we’ll  compare  the  cost  of  the  various  download  services  with  the  good  old fashioned high street retailers and a range of online CD stores. The results may surprise you.   136   4 – Online Music Services  The major music download services  MSN The vast majority of computers have Windows Media Player as standard and assuming  you  have  internet  access   preferably  broadband ,  accessing Microsoft’s own online music service is just a flew clicks away. But first, a few major cautions.  1. Media Player uses DRM. That means Microsoft has very substantial control  2.  3.  over how you play its music. It uses the WMA format to deliver its music online. That means you cannot use an iPod. iPods use a different DRM-controlled format called AAC. Just  because  your  player  says  it  can  use  WMA  doesn’t  mean  it  can  use Microsoft’s online music store.

Then  go  to  the  Sync  button  on  the  main  Media  Player screen.  From here you can control how you sync your music with your device.

You could, for instance, take your burnt CD and then rip it again and turn your music into copyright-free MP3 tracks, which you can then play on whatever device system on earth you choose to!

Now look at the bottom right hand side and you should be able to see MSN Playlist as an option.  You’ll see six icons, one of which is an icon for a CD. Once you’ve selected the music from your downloads that you want to burn hit this button. A ‘Queue List’ box now appears at the bottom right of your main screen  an MSN Music icon should also have appeared in your taskbar list .   Your main Media Player screen has now gone to the Burn page. You should now see your chosen track tracks listed on the left hand column. As you have a blank disc in the burner, your right hand column  the burner  should be clear.   142   Windows Media Player – Burning  4 – Online Music Services  t f o s o r c i M  m o r f  n o i s s i m r e p  h t i  w  d e t n i r p e r  t o h s  n e e r c s  t c u d o r p  t f o s o r c i M   r e y a p  l  l  i  , s e g o o n h c e t  i  ® a d e M s w o d n W  i  , n o i t a r o p r o C  143  Once you’ve lined up all the tracks you want to burn onto CD, you simply press Start Burn and Media Player handles everything else. It converts the files from DRM-protected WMA to WAV and then starts the burn. A few minutes later your CD is ready and waiting.  You  could  of  course  now  place  the  CD  straight  back  in  the  tray  and  rip  the contents of the CD to copyright free MP3 and do whatever you want with the tracks – not that Microsoft would approve!  In fact, you’d be annoying more than Microsoft – you’d also be annoying the company behind this and many other services in the UK, OD2. This outfit runs the  backend  of  a  number  of  digital  music  stores  –  they  all  share  the  same technology and software support.  These digital music stores include:    MyCokeMusic   Wanadoo     HMV Digital Downloads  Tiscali Music Club  Virgin Downloads      Ministry of Sound    And, of course, MSN Music itself   The Downloader’s Handbook  The various OD2 services  The only major difference between any of these services is the cost.    MSN Music is usually the cheapest, with charges pegged at 69p a track and  £6.99 per album.    MyCokeMusic charges 99p a track, or £7.99 an album.   Wanadoo does offer a special service that allows unlimited streaming for  just £4 a month. Otherwise it’s 79p a track or £6.99 an album. Tiscali also charges 69p a track and £6.99 an album.      Virgin, like MyCokeMusic, charges an expensive £7.99 an album or 99p a track; although if you bulk buy credits this does come down to a mere 80p a track  still not cheap! .    Ministry of Sound is great for dance music, but pricey at 99p a track or  £7.99 an album.  All these prices were correct at the time of writing and may now have changed.  144   4 – Online Music Services  Do you own this music permanently?  Yes  and  no.  The  Ministry  of  Sound  helpfully  spells  out  precisely  what rights you’re buying into with the OD2 service.  Here, in their words, is their definition of your permanent rights.  “Number of permitted file downloads = 5. This means that you can download the track up to five times after you have purchased it. This is useful if you want to have one copy on your computer at home and another copy on your computer at work for example. This also allows you to download the file again if you accidentally delete it from your hard drive or you replace your computer.   Track can be copied to portable device = Yes.  You can copy your download to a portable MP3 player an unlimited number of times.   Number of times the track can be burned to CD = 5.  You can burn your download to CD up to five times. If you want to burn the download to CD a sixth time you will need to purchase it again.   Downloads  are  only  available  in  certain  countries  due  to  music licensing regulations  UK and Ireland .”  So, yes, you own the music; but then again, no, you don’t. Remember the good old days when you bought some music – end of story. This DRM and licensing regime is restrictive and frankly the only way of breaking free of it is to pay for the music, burn it onto CD and then use it however you want to by ripping the CD and converting everything back into the MP3 format.  Apple iTunes Before we delve a little deeper into the only real challenger to Microsoft in the music player and digital download market, lets get a few things clear from the start.    Despite  Apple’s  audacious  marketing  and  hype  about  revolutionary  new  services, iTunes is almost as restrictive in its rights policy as OD2.  145   The Downloader’s Handbook           Its music store uses a form of DRM that requires you to use the AAC codec, itself a derivation of something we’ve already encountered called MP4. This is  both  good  news  –  on  iPods  this  codec  sounds  great  and  it’s  a  very efficient compression technology, and also bad news – you can only play AAC files on iPods. The iTunes player is truly versatile and in its PC version is a real challenger to Media Player. But it’s nowhere near as revolutionary as it likes to claim. It’s good, but not that good. If you don’t have an iPod and you have access to  Media  Player  I’m  not  really  convinced  that  iTunes  is  worth  the  extra bother.  It’s worth mentioning that iTunes is not an all purpose media player like Windows Media Player, – it doesn’t directly play compressed DivX or XviD videos   yet ,  although  you  can  access  this  facility  through  the  Apple Quicktime software that is bundled with the main installer.  So why bother dealing with what iTunes has to offer?  The bottom line is that iTunes as a piece of software is excellent and the music store built into the software is, by and large, wonderful.   Service profile – iTunes  User What it is  Why bother Source Difficulty How long will it  take to master  Beginner The iTunes player is a full multimedia player, and  a way of accessing the iTunes music store and it’s  designed to work with iPods Great alternative to Windows Media Player www.itunes.com Easy Ten minutes  Use iTunes if any of the points below matter a lot to you:  1. 2.  If you’ve got an iPod you have to use iTunes. You have no choice. If you’re after one of the biggest ranges of music in an online music store, iTunes is for you.  146   4 – Online Music Services  3.  4.  If you’re after a sleek interface and clever design that is much better to use than any rival player, with the exception of jetAudio. If you like audio books delivered through the iTunes music store.  In practice, it will do you no great harm to load iTunes anyway, even if you continue using rival players.  Setting up iTunes  Tip 1 – Make sure you get the latest version  Whatever you do make sure that you’re installing the very latest version of this software. You may have been given a version of iTunes with an iPod and that may be months, even years out of date. Apple regularly updates its software and it is worth your while making sure you have the latest version – at the moment it’s 6.0.4 but it could change any time now.  Tip 2 – Get the UK version  There is a US version of both the program and the music store – but you have no choice other than to use the UK version. If you visit the main Apple.com website  you’ll  spend  a  large  amount  of  time  fannying  around  with  the  US version before it eventually suggests getting a UK installation.  Make your life easy. Go to www.google.co.uk and type in ‘itunes’ and then hit the main link to their UK sub site – at www.apple.com uk itunes . Click on the ‘Download’ button and then choose the Windows version.   Install the program as normal.       During this process you’ll be asked on one screen to create a desktop icon  click  ‘Yes’   and  make iTunes  the  default  player  for  your  audio  files. Personally I don’t check this as I use Windows Media Player as well. You’ll also be asked to make an associated program, called QuickTime, the main player for media files. Do not click Yes to this – there are better default media players out there and for streaming of video content you’re better off using  something  called  QuickTime Alternative   more  on  this  in  the  next chapter on videos . Eventually  the  program  will  finish  installing  and  you’ll  notice  two  new icons on your desktop: one for iTunes and one for QuickTime.     147   The Downloader’s Handbook     Time to start iTunes for the first time. If you’re online your firewall will almost  immediately  notice  iTunes  trying  to  connect  to  the  web  –  let  it. You’ll then have to agree to Apple’s license agreement and after that you’ll run into iTunes’ set-up screen. This will ask you if it’s OK to search your computer for media files and then put them in its media library. That’s fine, it’s a great idea and won’t affect any other programs you have running, like Media Player.   s e n u T  i  l  e p p A     Next  click  ‘Yes’  on  letting  iTunes  organise  its  folders  and  then  you’ll  be asked to go to iTunes’ music store where you can register and join up. It’s up to you if you want to do this – you can always do it later – but for now just say ‘Yes’. You’ll now land on iTunes’ main page and be taken to the iTunes’  music  store.  Almost  instantly  you’ll  be  confronted  by  Apple’s slightly relentless bullishness – yes, that’s 500 million tracks downloaded from its store!!!    You now need to sign up for the service. In the top right hand side of the screen you’ll see a little button that says ‘Sign In’. Click this. You can now create  your  own  account   as  you  would  with  any  online  music  store   or sign in if you happen to already have an account.   148   iTunes – Music Store  4 – Online Music Services     It’s important not to make a mistake here, as the screen to sign up for a new account actually takes you, by default, to the US page. You can’t join the US service – which is a pity as the songs are cheaper! You will see an option to ‘click here’ if your credit card is registered outside the US. Click on this. You’ll now find yourself at the UK home store page. Click on ‘Sign In’  again  and  create  a  new  user  account.  You  have  to  sign  up  for  their license agreement and give your credit card details. Eventually you’ll pass through all the hoops and get signed in. You’re ready to go.  s e n u T  i  l  e p p A   149   The Downloader’s Handbook  iTunes – Creating a new account  s e n u T  i  l  e p p A   Beware of the first new user screen – it’s only for the US!  Tip – get rid of QuickTime  I’m  going  to  be  a  bit  controversial  here  and  suggest  you  uninstall QuickTime. Once  upon  a  time  QuickTime was  everyone’s  favourite video  program  –  not  anymore.  Times  have  changed  and  there  are  a number of rival formats that are, frankly, more widely used – namely Real’s various formats and Microsoft’s media files. 95% of the time you won’t  need  Quicktime and  if  you  do  there  is  an  alternative  called QuickTime Alternative.  Also  QuickTime has  a  nasty  habit  of  always loading up on start up  you can stop that  and of being generally a bit pesky and interfering. In my experience you don’t need it, so get rid of it.   150   4 – Online Music Services  Some iTunes basics  iTunes – Library  First, take a look at the layout. On the left hand side of the screen you’ll notice a list of files and options. Let’s start with the Library.  If there are no files in the Library you need to add them. Click on the ‘File’ option at the top left hand side and then select ‘Add Folders to Library’. Most people  will  have  their  music  inside  My  Documents,  but  if  not  you  can  tell iTunes where to look. If, like me, you have an awful lot of files, expect this process to take some time. iTunes will also convert any WMA files to AAC  the Apple format .  You’ll now see a long list of files organised into different columns. The first column  starting on the left  is the track name, followed by the duration of the track, the artist, the album title, genre and then My Rating. These are pretty self- explanatory – the important bit is how to display the list so that you can make  sense  of  it.  Personally,  I  use  the  album  as  the  way  of  organising  my Library – click on the album column at the top and it will automatically order all the content into albums – starting with albums beginning with an ‘A’.  s e n u T  i  l  e p p A   151   The Downloader’s Handbook  When you’ve found the track you’re looking for, double click it – the player will now start. If you want some fancy visualisations while you’re listening to the music click on the middle button in the bottom right hand corner – the symbol looks a bit like a representation of an atom. You’ll now see a randomly selected visualisation appear. If you want to turn this visualisation off simply click on this icon again.  s e n u T  i  l  e p p A   Back on the main library screen you can also edit information relating to this music file. Simply right click on the file and you’ll see a number of options. ‘Get Info’ retrieves all the ID3 tag information that you can now edit. You can also rate the track, which is a handy feature. If you award, say, five stars to your very favourite tracks you can then organise your library so that it plays the five star tracks first  simply click on the top of the My Rating column and it will sort all the files starting with five stars first . Alternatively you can select these files by looking at the left hand column and selecting ‘My Top Rated’.  You  can  also  change  the  texture  and  feel  of  the  music  played  by  using  the graphic  equaliser.  This  is  accessed  by  clicking  on  the  button  next  to  the Visualisation icon – it’s an icon with three channel mixers. Have a play with the equaliser and see which settings suit your speakers best.  152   4 – Online Music Services  Another nice feature of iTunes is its Party Shuffle. This randomly shuffles up all your tracks and then creates a long playlist which you can use at a party.   iTunes – Party Shuffle  You’ll soon notice that the elongated grey-green bubble at the top of the screen is the ‘progress’ box. This shows you how long the track is – simply drag the slider along if you want to fast forward through the track.  s e n u T  i  l  e p p A   153   The Downloader’s Handbook  Ripping tracks  You can also use iTunes to rip music from a CD and import it into your music library. Simply insert the CD, and run iTunes. It now searches one of the online music  databases  and  retrieves  all  the  track  information.  Before  you  click  on Import in the top right hand side of the screen, check your ripping options. Go to ‘Edit’, and then select ‘Preferences’. This box controls how iTunes operates and you’ll see a number of options that include how your iPod connects and one that says Importing. Click on this tab and you’ll see that you can configure iTunes on how to rip the file. It will by default use its own AAC format, but you can tell it to use MP3 if you want. You can also set the quality of the encoding: high is the default at 160Kbps and for most rips that should be sufficient.  While we’re in this Preferences Box, click on the ‘Advanced’ option. Here you’ll see where iTunes stores ripped and downloaded tracks. As a default it creates a folder inside My Music  which is in your My Documents folder . You can if you want, change this to whatever folder you want.  While iTunes rips the files it’ll also play you the music – a nice little feature.   iTunes preferences  s e n u T  i  l  e p p A   154   4 – Online Music Services  One last feature worth noting: you can share your music across a network. Let’s say you have a bunch of computers in your house, all of which are sharing a wireless connection. Using the Preferences box, click on ‘Sharing’ and enable ‘Share My Music’. Hey presto – you can stream music across the computers in the network.  iTunes’ great virtue is ease of use. It really is as simple as this to use – build a library and then start playing. But this is only the beginning, because the player also seamlessly integrates with the online music service.  Buying and playing music from the music store  Let’s buy some music from iTunes.  Click on the ‘Music Store’ green icon.  You  now  see  the  store  front  page.  You  can  immediately  click  on  any  of  the featured albums and then choose to buy either tracks  79p  or albums  prices vary but most major albums are £7.99 . To do this go to the album page and either click on the ‘Buy Album’ or ‘Buy Song’ button next to each track listing.  Like all its competitors you can get a thirty second preview of the track. Simply go to the album page and double click on the track name.  iTunes – Music Store  s e n u T  i  l  e p p A   155   The Downloader’s Handbook  To navigate around the music store you either use the backwards and forwards arrow buttons towards the top right side of the main frame, or if you want to go back to the home page simply click on the button featuring a small house symbol.  Once  you’ve  decided  that  you  want  to  buy  some  music   assuming  you’re registered as a user with a valid credit card , simply click on the ‘Buy Album’ or ‘Buy Song’ button. iTunes will check that it’s OK to charge the track album to your credit card and within a few seconds you’ll see the progress box  the grey-green long bubble  download the track into your iTunes’ folder.   To play downloaded music simply look at the main left column  the one that starts ‘Library’  and you should see a folder called Purchased Music. Click on this box and you should see your track.  If you then want to burn this track album to a CD, simply insert a blank disc, choose what tracks to put on the disc  by ticking or unticking the little box next to each track  and then click on the Burn Disk icon in the top right hand side of the screen. iTunes will now go away and burn the disk.   The iMix tool is a rather cute little feature of iTunes. The idea behind this is simple: you compile a list of your favourite tracks or maybe even a mix, and then either share the playlist with your friends  who must also have iTunes  or publish it to the iTunes website. Here’s how you compile your own iMix:  1. First, you’ll have to create a playlist from scratch. The easiest way to do this is go to a Library. Hold down the Ctrl key and click on all the tracks you want to include in a playlist. Then go to File  at the top left hand of the screen  and New Playlist From Selection.  2. You now see a new playlist file emerge in the left hand column. Next, give  the playlist a name.  3. Now select the playlist you want to publish as an iMix. 4. Click the Publish arrow to the right of the playlist file. If you don’t see the Publish arrow in the Source list, make sure the ‘Show links to Music Store’ checkbox is selected in the ‘General’ pane of iTunes’ Preferences.  5. Enter the requested information about your playlist and click ‘Publish’.  iMix  156   4 – Online Music Services  These iMixes include 30-second previews of any songs in your playlist that are also available on the iTunes Music Store. But it’s also important to note that if a song in your playlist is not available on the Music Store, the song won’t be listed in the iMix. Also, changes you make to your playlist after it’s published are not updated automatically on the iTunes Music Store. You need to click the Publish arrow each time you make a change that you want to share.   You can also buy other people’s iMix list. This is actually quite a good way of buying a compilation of what other people think is great music in your genre – an easy way of finding the best compilations is as follows:  Click on the ‘iMix’ option in the left hand column.    Go back to the Music Store.     You now see a whole range of iMix’s come up.     Type the genre or bands you like in the search box – a shortlist of iMixes is now displayed. Look at the right hand side of the page and you’ll see ‘Sorted  By  Name’.  This  means  the  chosen  iMixes  have  been  chosen  by name. Click on this box and choose ‘Sorted By Top Rated’ instead – this puts the iMixes that ordinary punters have highly rated first.   iMix – Music Store  s e n u T  i  l  e p p A   157   The Downloader’s Handbook  When you see an iMix you like double click on it and the playlist will appear. You’ll also see the total number of songs and how much it would cost you if you  had  to  buy  all  these  tracks   if  you  do  want  to  do  this  click  on  Buy  All Tracks’ button next to the price .  Celebrity Playlists  An  alternative  take  on  publishing  your  playlist is  to  see  what  music  your favourite artists like – this is the idea behind Celebrity Playlists. You can access this by again going to the main Music Store and going to the bottom left hand side of the page.  iMix – Celebrity Playlists  s e n u T  i  l  e p p A   You’ll now see a rogues gallery of famous  and not so famous  faces. If one takes your fancy just double click on the photo.   You’ll now see the Celebrity Playlist in detail. First, in the main screen at the top you’ll see their comments on the music. You can also buy all the tracks in the playlist plus you can go to the main playlist and hear a 30-second preview of all the tracks in the list.  158   4 – Online Music Services  Podcasting  Many people think that podcasting is yet another Apple innovation alongside its hugely successful iPod player. Far from it – podcasting is a simple audio- based diary, or blog, which has been transformed into an MP3 track. In effect, it’s just a personalised radio station that you host at a blogging site, or at your own  homepage.  But  Apple  have  been  very  quick  to  spot  the  potential  for podcasts and built in a facility to download your latest favourite podcasts using iTunes. You can in fact subscribe to podcasts through iTunes and each podcast will automatically update inside iTunes every time the broadcast is changed.  The quality of podcasts varies enormously; there are some amazing shows that belong  on  proper  radio  stations  you  can  access  for  free  and  some  utterly terrible services that should be avoided at all costs. The point is to have a hunt around, looking for topics that interest you.  To  get  podcasts using  iTunes  go  back  to  the  main  page.  Click  on  the  Music Store folder in the left column.

You’ll also see how many podcasts have been broadcast in the past and get the chance to download these  as  well.

Double click on Podcasts and you’ll  see  all  the  services  you’ve  subscribed  to  –  after  the  latest  episode  has been downloaded all you need to do is double click on the episode in the main playlist.  If you want even more podcasts you can go back to the main podcasts page at the music store and search for appropriate broadcasts by category or theme.  160   4 – Online Music Services  You’ll see a search option in the middle of the page on the left – you can enter a subject or you can click on one of the main subject areas below it.   You’ll now see the main Search page. Simply select your main category and then your sub-category and you’ll see a full list of podcasts available. If you like  what  you  see  simply  hit  the  ‘Subscribe’  button  and  iTunes  will automatically sign you up and then update the broadcasts.  iTunes – Podcast subscription  Radio   We looked  at  internet  radio  in  the  previous  chapter  and,  like  many  other players,  iTunes  supports  listening  to  internet  stations  from  within  the  main player.     Go  to  the  main  iTunes  screen   the  one  marked  ‘Source’  at  the  top   and  double click on the Radio icon.   s e n u T  i  l  e p p A   161   The Downloader’s Handbook  iTunes – Radio  s e n u T  i  l  e p p A     You’ll  now  see  a  large  number  of  music  genres  appear,  ranging  from 50s 60s pop to urban. If a particular genre takes your fancy click on the Play arrow button next to the genre and you’ll see a list of all the stations that are broadcast playing this type of music. If you click Ambient for instance you’ll see 19 options listed. They range from ‘Analog Voyager’ which promises ‘Downtempo ambient’ through to ‘Smooth Lounge, For the Chill of it…’        With some stations you’ll also see a number of different options: they’re the  same  programming  but  they  are  broadcast  using  different  quality settings. These quality settings  called bitrate  might range from a rather poor 28Kbps through to high quality 128Kbps or even higher. If you like what you see just double click on the station  preferably at the highest bitrate setting  and it will start playing.     Napster You may remember Napster from its earlier incarnation as the poster child of the underground file sharing movement. This was the first great peer-to-peer network  where  you  could  download  hundreds  of  thousand  of  different  MP3  162   4 – Online Music Services  tracks,  all  for  free.  Ah,  the  good  old  days!  And  then  the  massive  media combines ganged up on it and it was forced to shut down.  And then a strange thing happened. Napster turned from hunter to gamekeeper. It was sold off, to German media giant Bertelsmann, and relaunched first in the US and then in the UK as a legal music download service.  Its main appeal is that it offers a flat rate fee service. You pay £9.99 a month for unlimited access to all the music in its vast library. That means you can download any of its 2 million tracks. But be warned: these streamed tracks can only be played on your PC. If you want to play your Napster tracks on your MP3  player  you  must  have  a  compatible  MP3  player.  The  range  of  music  is bigger than with MSN Music OD2 and iTunes but by no means is every type of music included.   You can also choose to burn your chosen music files to a compact disc but you have to pay additionally for the privilege. This is charged like iTunes and MSN Music on a per track or per album basis.  One final fly in the ointment: stop paying the monthly subscription and your music will stop playing if you’ve bought it through the subscription service. Start the subscription up again and your music selection restarts.   Tip: The  bottom  line  is  that  Napster is  great  for  people  who  spend inordinate amounts of time sitting in front of their PC. If you use iPods a lot, forget it! iPods will not accept Napster’s tracks.

They’re a huge improvement on nothing, but they’re still a little cumbersome, rather expensive  we’ll talk about this in more detail later , and they have pretty restrictive digital rights management systems built into them, which controls what you can and cannot do with your music.  There  are  no  such  problems  with  pioneering  eMusic – you  can  find  it  at www.emusic.com. It  was  one  of  the  first  legal  music  download  services  –  it started way back in 1998 – and is still one of the best.   Why is eMusic so good?     First, it’s cheap. The basic service costing $9.99 a month, lets you download up to 40 tracks a month – that’s just over £6 a month. Even the premium service, which allows 90 downloads a month, is just $19.99 or just over £12 a month.    Any  music  you  buy  is  yours  –  end  of  story.  You  can  burn  it,  send  it  to another  computer  in  your  home  network  or  play  it  on  whatever  music player you want. There’s none of this fierce copyright protection that spoils the Napster  and Apple iTunes  offering.  168   4 – Online Music Services    And last but by no means least, eMusic has a reservoir of music  70,000 albums and hundreds of thousands of individual tracks  you’re unlikely to find at the major music sites – it’s a ‘serious’ music fans’ nirvana, full of alternative rock, jazz and folk.   Tip: If your music tastes are very mainstream, and Coldplay represents your idea of alternative, you’re likely to find eMusic a bit strange. It’s not jam packed full of major record label releases and although you  will  find  the  odd  few  tracks  from  the  major  labels,  it’s resolutely, even defiantly, alternative.

But be careful:     The registration screen will sign you up and take your credit card details and  unless  you  cancel,  it  will  automatically  sign  you  up  for  the  more expensive  Premium  service  when  you  finish  downloading your  25  free tracks. If you only want the trial and nothing else be sure to cancel!    After you’ve set up your account, you can browse online through eMusic’s web  pages.  Once  you’ve  found  an  album  you  like – it’s  very  much  an album- orientated service – you simply click on the link and you’ll be taken to the album page.  169   The Downloader’s Handbook  eMusic – Free Trial  c i s u M e      Like all the other music services you can either preview the track  click on the small loudspeaker icon , or download it  the down arrow icon .

The most important thing is to tell the program where you want your music saved to – click on ‘View’, select ‘Options’. You’ll now see a box called General and you’ll also see a location where your music will be saved to. The default is a My Music folder on your desktop. I’d change this and tell Download Manager to save it to your main My Music folder inside My Documents.  172   eMusic – Downloading music  4 – Online Music Services  You’ll  also  see  all  the  music  tracks  downloading  –  over  a  standard  2Mbps connection you should be able to download one track every minute or a whole album in around ten minutes.  Tip:  If you do sign up for eMusic, make sure you download its toolbar. It installs a toolbar inside Internet Explorer that allows you to search its  music  catalogue,  and  block  pop-ups.  Its  best  feature  is  a  free music track you can download every day. As you’d expect some of the tracks are plain awful but some are fantastic and, just to remind you, they’re free!  c i s u M e   173   The Downloader’s Handbook  Audible This small US-based operator has cornered the market in spoken word audio tracks  and  its  recently  launched  a  UK  website   www.audible.co.uk .

You next have to work out which subscription plan you’re going for. At the time of writing you can either:   1.  sign up to a basic package at £9.99 a month, which gets you a free book a month and one free magazine subscription; or   2. £14.99 a month which gets you two of each.   Once you’ve signed up for one of their subscription plans you need to log back into the main website and start searching for the audio books you want. When you’ve found one, buy the book and then apply any credits you are owed with your  subscription.  You  go  through  the  checkout  process  and  eventually  the spoken word book is added to your library.   Once you’ve made the purchase you’ll be taken to ‘My Account’ where you’ll see the book listed. Next to the book title you’ll see ‘Get It Now’.

If your book is hours and hours long you’ll need multiple CDs.  Other services  Wippit  Small, feisty music website, Wippit  www.wippit.co.uk  is by far the best of the also-rans of the digital music wars. Originally launched as a legitimate, paid-for rival  to  Napster-like  file  sharing  networks it  showed  that  you  could  build  a network based on accessing other people’s music files whilst staying strictly legal.  l  i  e b d u A   177   The Downloader’s Handbook  It’s had a few ups and downs over the last few years and is still largely the preserve  of  indie-labels  and  bands,  although  some  major  music  labels  have signed up their music. But it still has one of the very best deals on the market. For £60 a year you can access its entire music library of over 60,000 tracks and what’s more you can use these MP3 and WMA files in whatever device you want – none of this annoying shortlist of MP3 players authorised to use the service.  HMV Digital and Virgin Digital  Napster and iTunes are also facing more mass market competition from HMV Digital   www.hmvdigital.com  and  Virgin  Digital   www.virgindigital.co.uk . Both use their own players and both operate rather like Napster in that you can either pay per track or album or pay a monthly charge to access all the tracks as temporary downloads. As with Napster, this monthly subscription option is great value as long as you keep the subscription going – stop paying and the music tracks are disabled.  PlayLouder  PlayLouder  www.playlouder.co.uk  is the dark horse on the UK digital music scene. Until recently it was well known as the champion  like Wippit  of indie rock music, and many users simply joined the service so that they could access their  Singles  Club, which  gave  away  free  tracks  every  month  or  so.  But PlayLouder has bigger ambitions and is launching a broadband ISP service that throws in access to all the music tracks in its library as many times as you want for as long as you want. Its clever trick is to ring fence all its users inside a kind of closed garden, a digital walled community, that PlayLouder can police. That  means  none  of  those  naughty  file  sharers  will  be  allowed  on  these networks and thus the big music labels feel safe in sharing their music for a fixed fee.  178   4 – Online Music Services  Which service to use? The good news is that competition between these various online music services does  seem  to  be  encouraging  innovation,  although  the  price  of  albums  and individual  tracks  does  seem  to  be  staying  suspiciously  stable  and  uniform across the various websites.  Range of music The greatest progress has been made in opening up the record label libraries. You should now be able to find pretty much everything you’ll ever need on one or other of the main sites. To test this out I set out to find ten, very varied tracks on three popular networks: iTunes, Napster and Wippit.  Song  iTunes  Napster  Wippet  Audio Bullys – Shot Me Down The Eagles – Hotel California America – Horse With No Name Ram Jam – Black Betty Bob Marley – Pimpers Paradise Dinah Washington –  Is you is or is you ain’t my baby? Dire Straits – Brothers in Arms Nina Simone – Sinnerman Harry Belafonte – Scarlet Ribbon Mr. Scruff – Ahoy There  a r a r r a a a a a  a r a r a r a r a r a a a a a r a r aa  Napster seems to offer the greatest range of music, closely followed by iTunes with  Wippit trailing  well  behind.  To  be  fair  to  Apple’s  iTunes,  it  claims  its library is slightly bigger than Napster’s, but Napster does seem to have the edge on those ‘most wanted’ kind of tracks. Also Wippit’s back library is much more indie rock focused and you wouldn’t really expect it to have the same range as Napster or iTunes.  179   The Downloader’s Handbook  The  number  of  no-shows  at  iTunes  surprised  me  –  not  to  have  the  classic Eagles’ track Hotel California is a bit of an oversight, as is the absence of the Marley track. Still, the site seemed to have everything else you could possibly ask  for  and  is  obviously  very  strong  when  it  comes  to  latest  releases  and specialist genres like jazz and spoken word books.  Cost What about the cost of music online? Let’s take Coldplay’s popular album X&Y. On the high street the CD retails for around £10, but once you go online prices start to drop dramatically.  Shop music service  Price inc delivery  Download service or shop  Napster MSN Music 4CheapCDs 101CD.com Tesco Jersey iTunes Music Store Play.com CD-Wow  £6.95 £6.99 £6.99 £7.95 £7.95 £7.99 £7.99 £8.75  Download Download Online Shop Online Shop Online Shop Download Online Shop Online Shop   Note: All the prices were correct at the time of writing.  The very cheapest way to buy this album is via a download service. Napster comes out top again, selling it for £6.95 as a download. MSN Music is not far behind at £6.99 but here’s the really worrying thing: at least one online shop  not a download service  – low profile 4CheapCDs – is selling the album, the physical hard copy, for the same price as an electronic download  no CD, no CD case, no CD cover booklet !  Ask yourself this: how can a digital music service charge the same as a shop that sells  the  physical  thing?  The  shop-based  retailers  have  to  pay  for, staff, warehousing, delivery and the actual CD and its duplication costs. It’s also true  180   4 – Online Music Services  that many of the cheapest shops don’t have to pay VAT as they’re based offshore, but that tax advantage should only account for a £1 difference in price.   Astonishingly, iTunes charge the same price for a music download as online shop  Play.com.  I  say,  astonishingly,  because  Play.com  is  a  well  known,  well established, Jersey based operator with a great customer reputation, yet they charge  the  same  price  for  this  album  even  though  they  have  to  physically supply you with a hard copy.  And here comes the next outrage…  At least with a CD in your hands you can choose to do what you want with your music – if you want to copy it to your MP3 player, you can. Online music services still try to police your usage of the purchased album so that the tracks can only go on approved devices. Most sensible users choose to bypass this by burning the purchased tracks onto a CD, but guess who has to pay for the blank CD – you!  Digital music services do, to be fair, have a lot going for them. If you want to buy  individual  tracks   priced  at  between  79p  and  99p   going  online  for  a download makes absolute sense. Not all the tracks on Coldplay’s X&Y are that great, so why not pay just a few pounds for the best tracks? Online music shops can’t hope to compete with this flexible service.  The use of subscription-based services  pay £9.99 a month to access everything  is  also  a  great  deal,  but  be  aware  that  doesn’t  mean  that  you’re  buying  the music permanently. Stop paying the subscription and the music vanishes. Also remember that if you want to play these tracks on your authorised MP3 player you’ll probably have to pay a premium.  Bottom line  Until the price of an album falls closer to £5, I’d buy the real thing, the CD, online or at a record store. If you want to see if you like the music before you buy the  hard copy, physical  album, sign up for one of the streaming services offered by the likes of MSN Music that lets you listen to each track on an album for 1p or through a monthly subscription plans that costs about £10 a month.  In this chapter we came across DRM, and where to download music and audio books. At this stage, you should now be feeling comfortable with downloading music  from  the  internet  and  playing  it  on  your  PC.  But  strap  yourself  in, because next up is where the fun starts – video!  181    5  Digital Video    5 – Digital Video  Words, sound and music are great, but they’ll never measure up to the experience of  video  and  film.  The  image  accompanied  by  sound  provides  so  much  more satisfaction and information, yet it comes at a massive digital cost: size.  Video files are big  Video files are huge, so big in fact that until very recently working with video on a PC was solely the preserve of TV companies and video editors with giant super-powered computers with oodles of storage and expensive monitors. That has now changed, but there is one constant – regardless of its format, digital video gobbles up huge amounts of hard disk space and processor capacity.  Here’s a small example.   Fetch one of your favourite pre-recorded DVDs and load it into your computer. Don’t bother playing the DVD on your PC using software like Windows Media Player – instead go to the My Computer icon and locate the film DVD on the drive list. Right click on the Film DVD icon and select ‘Explore’. You’ll see a list of folders. Look for one called VIDEO TS – this contains all the video and audio files. Open up this folder and then go to ‘View’ in the top right hand side of the screen and select ‘Details’.   t f o s o r c i M m o r f  n o i s s i m r e p  h t i  w  d e t n i r p e r  t o h s  n e e r c s  t c u d o r p  t f o s o r c i M   n o i t a r o p r o C  185   The Downloader’s Handbook  You’ll almost certainly see a list rather like the one on the previous page – from the Star Wars IV DVD. You’ll see a series of files with odd names that, in this case, total 7.37GB. That’s a huge amount of data.  To put it into some perspective, that works out at more than 15 times the data on a typical CD album  the uncompressed WAV files that is , or over 1000 times the total data from an album that been compressed into the MP3 format.  Or to put it another way – until just two years ago, that was only a few gigs under the size of the whole hard drive of a normal PC.  1 film = 1 computer hard drive!  This simple example underlines a number of important topics we’ll be exploring in this chapter.  The biggest topic is that of compression – dump just a few DVDs onto your hard drive and you could run out of space in no time. That forces the computing industry to come up with ways of compressing the data.  But  those  different  ways  of  compressing  the  video  also  present  another challenge.  There  are  many  different  compressions,  codecs  and  systems  for playing video, and many of them are so obscure and so tricky to use that the average user simply panics and runs away.   The message of this chapter is: Don’t Panic!  Nearly  all  the  major  formats  used  in  video  are  easy  to  manipulate  and  use provided you have a bit of know-how and the right tools.  But there’s one last point. Even after using clever ways of compressing data, video files are still very large packets of data. That means they take a long time to stream or download and whenever you try to work with files, expect it all to take a long time. Hours, rather than minutes.  It’s all worth it though. With just a small amount of knowledge and the right tools you too can turn your PC into a hugely powerful multimedia machine.   186   5 – Digital Video  By the end of this chapter you’ll have learnt how to:  1. Stream pop promos and short movie clips over the internet. 2. Work with clever codecs that turn movies into relatively small   3. Use  simple  to  use  media  players  that  will  play  virtually  every  4. Start backing up your DVDs onto your hard drive. 5. Get compressed movies onto a DVD that can then be played on your  =====  600 Mb files.  format.  TV.  =====  Video streaming Go  to  the  fabulous  Atom  films website   www.atomfilms.com  and  witness  a miracle. The idea of using the internet to watch video content was laughable until just a few years ago. Most of us were struggling along with old fashioned dial-up connections that made retrieving small emails difficult enough, without worrying about short video files.  Broadband has  changed  everything.  Its  not  only  made  the  process  of downloading content much easier, its also prompted websites like Atom films  and  the  equally  fabulous  iFilm site   to  innovate  with  new  streaming technologies  that  allow  reasonably  large  data  files  to  be  broken  down  into small packets and sent over the internet like traditional TV broadcasts.  We first ran into streaming with internet radio  check out the chapter on digital music  and the principle behind video streaming is no different. Just as music is chopped up and sent out in streaming packets of data, so is video. And just like streaming audio you need a special player on your computer to play that streamed content.  The first time you visit media-rich websites like iFilm and Atom, you’ll be asked to specify which player you want to use. As you’ll see from the iFilm window over the page:  187   The Downloader’s Handbook  iFilm – Media Preferences  m  l i  F  i    There are three main choices   1. Windows Media Player – much the best option 2. Real Player – the video-based client for the Real Networks 3. QuickTime – Apple’s take on streaming video  I’d recommend that whenever you’re given the choice use the Windows Media Player option. Having chosen which streaming player you use  you may also be asked to specify if you have a broadband connection or not  you’ll then see a new Internet Explorer window pop up.  This in-built player contacts the main web siteservers and starts downloading video and audio content so that it can be played on your media player. The process  can  take  anything  from  ten  seconds  to  one  minute  and  is  called buffering. Eventually, you’ll be ready to watch the video, but first you might be forced to watch some hideous US car advert  that’s the price of accessing free video content these days . If the content is originally shot on video, the quality of the picture on the small screen will probably be rather poor while animation will tend to look very clean if a bit jerky.  188   Atom Films  5 – Digital Video  Unfortunately,  some  web  sites  are  a  little  more  demanding  than  Atom  and iFilm. Some insist on you using just one media player – either QuickTime or Real.  Tip: Don’t install either of these programs unless you really need to – they’re both big and buggy and tend to insist on taking over your desktop. Luckily there are alternatives…  s m  l i  F m o t A   189   The Downloader’s Handbook  Real Alternative  We looked at Real Alternative in our chapter on digital music. It’s a small, free program which doesn’t have annoying spyware or adverts and lets you use all Real media content. You can find the program at most shareware websites, but its  home  is  at  www.codecguide.com about_real.htm.  Follow  the  usual installation instructions – making sure that the program associates itself with all Real files. Once installed it will play all Real Video files, no hassle.  QuickTime Alternative  Apple’s  QuickTime was,  like  Real  Player,  very  much  an  internet  streaming pioneer,  but  its  been  around  long  enough  for  someone  to  come  up  with  a freeware alternative,  called,  unsurprisingly,  QuickTime Alternative.  It’s available  the  Real  Alternative,  at www.codecguide.com about_qt.htm, although it’s a much bigger file, weighing in  at  over  10MB.  As  with  the  Real  Alternative,  make  sure  the  program associates itself with all QuickTime files  they all end in .mov  although this should be done as standard during installation.   same  website  from   the   as   Websites with great film content    iFilm  www.ifilm.com  Fantastic website with loads of free videos, including mad spoof movies, real-life bizarre moments and some wonderful short clips.    Atom Films  www.atomfilms.com   The  best  short  film  movie  site  on  the  net.  Like iFilm you’ll  have  to  sit through the odd, really boring ad, but it’s full of specially commissioned short  films  and  animations  of  which  the  highlight  has  to  be  the  truly wonderful Angry Kid.   BBC  www.bbb.co.uk   What can I say – there’s loads of video and programmes available here plus radio broadcasts.    MyMovies.net  www.mymovies.net   Film clip preview service with all the best trailers.  190   5 – Digital Video  Playing video Files on your PC You’ll have worked out by now that Windows Media Player is a fairly useful piece  of  software  that  comes  as  standard  on  PCs  equipped  with  the  XP operating system. It plays most of the key video and audio formats and is, in the big scheme of things, fairly easy to use – it’s also pretty much indispensable when it comes to video streaming.  VideoLAN Media Player  But Media Player is far from perfect, and although useful it shouldn’t be your only multimedia video player. Why not try out its open source, free rival called VideoLAN  Media  Player  abbreviated  to  VLC  Player   –  you  can  get  it  from www.videolan.org vlc.  Program profile – VideoLAN Media Player  User What it is  Why bother  Beginner A free media player that will play virtually every  video format in existence Its very easy to use, doesn’t use up too many  system resources and is completely open source and reliable  Source Difficulty How long will it  take to master  www.videolan.org vlc Very easy A few minutes  It’s hardly the catchiest of names but the VideoLAN player has a number of huge advantages over the Microsoft player:  1.  It plays virtually every video  and audio  file format and compression codec on planet Earth with the exception of Real media files.  2. Unlike the Windows Media Player it will play all DVDs and SVCDs. The Windows Media Player can handle playing DVDs but it requires an extra plug-in, which has to be separately downloaded.  191   The Downloader’s Handbook  3.  It’s easy to use, has a very simple intuitive interface and doesn’t come with any spyware, any annoying adverts to buy other Microsoft products or visit Microsoft  websites,  and  doesn’t  come  bundled  with  loads  of  annoying copyright protection tools.  After installation, start up the program and sit back and admire its elegant yet tiny interface.   The VLC player is a model of clever, restrained design.   To open a video file, simply select ‘File’, and then ‘Quick Open File’, find the piece of video and sit back and enjoy.  N A L o e d V   i  192   5 – Digital Video  If you want to play a DVD simply select ‘File’, then ‘Open Disc’. Make sure that on the Disc Tab, the device letter is your DVD player and then press ‘OK’. One word of warning though – some DVDs have a form of software protection built into them that stops you playing DVDs unless you install a specific piece of software  devised  by  InterVideo.  You  can  choose  to  install  this  software  –  it loads automatically when you insert the DVD – but my advice is not to bother as  it’s  yet  another  piece  of  annoying  and  frankly  unnecessary  DRM,  or copyright protection. The way around this program is to load in another very clever  piece  of  paid-for  software  called  AnyDVD –  available  from www.slysoft.com for $39. It stops all copyright protection software dead in its tracks and will let you play all kinds of DVDs.  After you’ve loaded your DVD you’ll be taken straight to the main menu page, where you’ll see all the main options you’d get on a normal DVD player.  You probably won’t want to watch the movie in a small box – why not watch it full screen on your monitor? To do this right click on the movie and select ‘Fullscreen Mode’. You’ll also see a number of other controls that let you alter the audio levels, choose subtitles and move on to the next chapter of the film.  193   If  you  want  to  get  rid  of  the  fullscreen,  simply  right  click  again  and  then unclick ‘Fullscreen’.  The Downloader’s Handbook  VLC Media player  N A L o e d V   i  VLC Media Player has one last great strength – it’ll play most of the key formats used in video compression including the dominant video codec which is called DivX  we’ll take a closer look at this format next .  Tip: VLC Media Player will also play any subtitles you may have with the  film.  194   5 – Digital Video  The Codec War – DivX vs XviD One of the most annoying aspects of digital video is the astonishing number of formats  and  codecs  in  existence.  Even  the  most  experienced  users  are sometimes fazed by all the formats lurking around. And although players like the  VLC  Media  Player  will  recognise  most  of  them,  there  are  some  slightly weird formats  you might run into one called Matroska for instance  that even it will struggle with.  The great grand-daddy of all video formats was something called MPEG-1  the MPEG  stands  for  Motion  Picture  Experts  Group .  This  video  compression standard  was  originally  brought  in  so  that  the  movie  studios  could  fit  a standard length feature film on one or two CDs, usually marketed as VCDs in places like Asia and Africa. The quality is close to VHS and, like VHS, it’s a dying format with little or no content available these days.  MPEG-2 is  a  distinct  improvement  on  its  predecessor  and  is  the  standard compression format used by most broadcasters and DVD manufacturers. If you use DVDs a lot, you’re using MPEG-2.  MPEG-1  MPEG-2  MPEG-4  Demand  for  even  smaller  video  files,  with  even  more  compressed  data  has spawned yet another mutation of this format – MPEG-4. This is an ‘all things to all people’ compression mechanism that is expected to replace MPEG-2 for broadcast  quality  applications,  especially  as  it’s  approximately  twice  as efficient at crushing down file sizes. It has also been designed from the ground up to deal with streaming and interactive applications.   MPEG-4 comes  in  many  different  shapes  and  sizes,  and  one  of  the  most common  is  something  called  DivX.  This  is  a  proprietorial  video  codec technology that’s also based on the MPEG-4 standard. Its huge success led the developers  to  design  a  completely  new  product  that’s  absolutely  superb  at compressing video to an extremely small size with a high degree of quality. The  195   The Downloader’s Handbook  DivX format has also gone through a number of different mutations – the first was something called DivX 3.11, which was then followed by DivX5 and now DivX6.   Just to really confuse things you might also see an alternative format called XviD.  It’s  not  actually  a  commercial  product  like  DivX,  but  an  open  source project  which  is  developed  and  maintained  by  programmers  all  around  the world. XviD, is yet another take on the MPEG-4 format and like DivX is expert at compressing big film files ripped from a DVD into small files.  You’ll also see yet another file type lurking around called AVI. This is also not actually  a  video  compression  format  as  such,  just  a  file  type  and  stands  for Audio  Video  Interleaved.  Its  Microsoft’s  own  video  format  combining  audio and video coding in alternate segments.   VOB and IFO  Confusingly if you explore the files contained within a DVD you won’t see any mention at all of the above AVI or MPEG files – instead you’ll see lots of VOBs and IFOs. These aren’t actually compression formats  like MPEG  but simply file types that marshal together all the video, sound and subtitle files in one folder that  can  be  played  on  a  DVD  player  –  the  VOB files   VOB stands  for  Video Object   contain  the  raw  video  and  audio  data,  while  the  IFO file  is  just  an InFOrmation file that tells the DVD player where to find video and audio files.  WMV and MOV  In  the  world  of  streaming video  you’ll  also  come  across  WMV  files   the Windows  Video  streaming standard   and  MOV files,  Apple’s  take on  video streaming files using the QuickTime format.  XviD  AVI  196   Amount of MBs storage needed for 60 minutes of film  Can you play on an ordinary DVD player?  5 – Digital Video  Video quality  Pretty good  Dolby Digital Audio  Yes  660  660  600  2,600  750 880  Yes but only a small number of specialised devices Yes but only a small number of specialised devices No  Pretty good  Poor  Yes  Superb  No No  Poor Poor  Yes  Yes  Yes  No No  Format  DivX 6  XviD  MPEG-1 or VCD MPEG-2 or VOB files QuickTime Windows Media files  Source: Toms Hardware Guide – www.tomshardware.com  Compressing video – the DivX XviD revolution In the Old World of home entertainment, pre-broadband, we were, by and large, satisfied  with  watching  films  on  a  DVD,  on  a  DVD  player,  in  our  lounge. Broadband has changed all that. More and more of us now prefer to either play our films on a PC, and perhaps source our films over the internet via some form of download network.   DivX  is  the  software-based  backbone  of  this  digital  film  revolution.  It’s essential you understand it and use it for two very simple reasons:  1.  If you want to download movies from the internet file sharing networks we’ll  encounter  in  the  next  chapter, you’ll  need  DivX.  Most  of  the  film content online is compressed and encoded using DivX or its open source rival XviD. If you have the right codec you can then play these compressed  197   The Downloader’s Handbook  2.  movies  back  on  either  your  PC  or  on  a  DVD  player  that  has  built-in DivX XviD support. If you want to store your favourite movies on your computer you’ll need to compress them. Most DVD-based movies contain huge amounts of data – between  7GB  and  9GB  –  which  can  only  be  stripped  down  and compressed using a codec like DivX. Once they’ve been squeezed down to just under 700MB you can then pack dozens of movies onto a dedicated hard drive that stores all your films.  Working with DivX and XviD Most of us only ever require one thing when dealing with either DivX or XviD – the codec. This is the small bit of software that tells your media player how to deal with all this compressed video.   The good news here is that the VLC Player already has the codec built into it so you don’t need to download any new software. Microsoft’s Media Player 11 Series doesn’t come with built-in DivX and XviD support, but as soon as you try  and  play  the  files  the  program  will  head  online  and  download  the appropriate codec automatically.  If any of your media players still can’t play DivX and XviD files it’s easy to find them online and download for free, although you should be able to get by for the time being with DivX 5 codec  it comes with a player . This is available for free at www.divx-digest.com software divxcodec5.html. Just download the Free Standard version. If you want the most up-to-date version of the DivX software  go  to  the  company’s  website  at  www.divx.com divx play  and download  the  free  Play  bundle.  The  XviD codec  can  be  found  at www.xvidmovies.com codec . Simply select the latest Koepi code.  That’s it: any DivX or XviD file should automatically play on your computer, hassle free.   DivX Create Bundle You can choose to use DivX simply as a codec that works with other media players,  or  with  DivX’s  own  player.  But  there  is  a  far  more  powerful  tool lurking inside its website. It’s called the DivX Create Bundle, and although it’s not free  it costs $20  it gives novice users the chance to create their own DivX  198   5 – Digital Video  files.  It  also  contains  the  latest  version  of  the  DivX codec  –  version  6. According to the developers this new codec offers up to 40% better quality and compression  than  the   previous   DivX5  codec,  plus  the  ability  to  work interactive video menus, subtitles and multiple audio tracks. It’s all useful stuff but the most powerful tool is the DivX Converter. This is a great way of taking movies off your DVDs, and then compressing them into smallish data files – between 600MB and 800MB – that can then be stored on your hard drive, or even  burnt  onto  a  DVD  and  then  played  on  specially  adapted  DivX  DVD players.   Program profile – DivX  User What it is  Why bother  Source Difficulty How long will  it take to master  DVD Decrypter  Beginner A program that converts your video into compressed  files that can then be played on a PC Compress a film down to 700MB and you can back-  up dozens of movies www.divx.com Very easy A few minutes  If  you  do  decide  to  use  the  software  I’d  also  recommend  downloading  an additional  program  called  DVD  Decrypter –  available  for  free  at www.dvddecrypter.com. This clever piece of software grabs video files from a DVD, breaks through any encryption that might have been built into the DVD and then dumps the video files onto your hard disk. Why the need for extra software? The DivX Create Bundle and specifically its Converter program are not designed to work with copyright protected DVDs that have special software built in to stop any form of backing up or copying – that means that if you load in a copyright protected file they won’t be able to do any compression, which is where DVD Decrypter comes in..   Install the program, and then insert the DVD you want to back-up into your main drive, and then launch Decrypter. Before you start you need to make sure  199   it’s going to decrypt and extract the right files – click on ‘Mode’ and make sure you have ISO selected.   The Downloader’s Handbook  DVD Decrypter  You’ll see that it’s automatically selected all the main film files that contain the movie.  All you need do next is select a folder to save the decrypted files to and then hit the main ‘DVD to Disk’ button on the bottom left hand side. The program will now take about 30 minutes to extract and unlock the files.  DivX Converter  Once you’ve finished it’s time to open up DivX Converter. As software goes this is a rather pleasing minimal interface designed rather like a stopwatch. Select the Home Theatre profile by using the arrows at the bottom of the screen. Then press  the  ‘View  List’  button.  A  new  ‘Files  to  Encode’  box  appears.  Simply navigate  your  way  to  where  you’ve  saved  the  files  that  DVD  Decrypter extracted and cracked by using the ‘Add’ button, then click OK. You’ll also be asked on the View List screen if you want to convert the files to a certain size – 700MB for a CD, or 2GB for a DVD. Choose the 700MB CD option.  200   DivX Converter  5 – Digital Video  DivX  Converter will  now  take  these  video  files  and  compress  them  –  the amount of encoding time will vary but it shouldn’t take more than three to four hours.  i  X v D   201   The Downloader’s Handbook  Tip: Simple,  elegant  interfaces  such  as  DivX Converter are  great,  but they  have  one  big  downside,  namely  you  don’t  get  many  extra features, especially the ability to set up any individual options and preferences. One of the slightly annoying features of the Converter tool is that it doesn’t tell you where you’re saving your files to – it just starts converting. It actually saves them in the DivX Films folder – you’ll find it inside the program files  click on ‘My Computer’, pick the  main  drive  which  is  usually  C ,  look  for  DivX  and  you’ll  see another folder called Movies. This is where your compressed film is saved to.  More weird File types The name of the game with video, as you’ll have guessed by now, is to find ways of compressing the size of the files so that they can be easily transferred onto a computer and then transferred across the internet. For most people who use file sharing networks, like BitTorrent and eMule, that means working with DivX and XviD. But you’ll be slightly disheartened to know that there are in fact  yet  more  formats  and  file  types  that  are  widely  used.  Two  in  particular stand out: RAR files  a kind of exotic zip file , and Bin Cue files.  RAR files Programmers  have  been  trying  to  find  clever  ways  of  compressing  files  for decades. Unlike modern compression technologies, such as DivX, zip software doesn’t  alter  or  convert  the  underlying  video  files.  It  simply  uses  clever algorithms  to  compact  down  the  actual  file  itself.  Zipping  is  very  easy, and support for unzipping zipped files is built into the latest versions of XP – you simply right click on the zipped file and select ‘Extract’.  This simplicity has been taken to rather extreme lengths with a format called RAR. You’ll find all sorts of RAR files on the internet, but most of them will be video files – it’s a great way of zipping up big film files and then turning them into lots of little data packages that can be broken up and sent over the internet. WinRAR is a shareware program  you get a 30 day free trial  that will handle formats such as ACE, ARJ, BZ2, CAB, GZ, ISO, JAR, LZH, TAR, UUE and Z.  202   Go to www.rarlab.com and click on ‘Downloads’. You’ll now see a list of all the available versions – click on the latest version.   5 – Digital Video  WinRAR – Setup  During the installation you’ll be presented with a box that asks whether you want  WinRAR to  manage  a  huge  range  of  archived,  zipped  and  compressed files. Keep all of them ticked.  B A L R A R   203   Open the newly installed program and you’ll see the main screen.  The Downloader’s Handbook  WinRAR – Main screen  B A L R A R   If you download a file with a lot of .RAR files, click on the top folder in the folder list. Alternatively use the drop-down menu line – in the diagram above the one starting C:\Documents and Settings\[Your Name], and pull the list of locations down.   Once you’ve navigated your way to the .RAR file, highlight it and then click the ‘Extract To’ button at the top.  204   WinRAR – File extraction  5 – Digital Video  This Extraction Box will give you a number of options for extracting the .RAR files. First set the location of where you want the final file saved. Then leave all the other options as is and hit ‘OK’.  WinRAR will  now  take a minute  or  two  to  extract  all  the  files  into  your destination folder.  That’s it! Not at all complicated.  Cue and Bin files You may encounter a strange pair of files in your online travels, namely .cue and .bin files. They’re brothers and sisters of a rather exotic little format that originated with CDs. Many programmers found that the best way of dealing with a programme or film was to turn it into an image file that could then be burnt as one onto a blank CD. If you come across these files, you’ve got two choices:  B A L R A R   205   The Downloader’s Handbook  1. You can burn them onto a  V CD which can be played back on a home DVD player. To do this: open up a CD burning program like Nero  or any other CD  burning  software  that  can  burn  from  image  like  Alcohol  120%   and select the ‘Burn from image’ option. Select the cue file you want to burn, and burn it to a CD or as  S VCD. Afterwards, test the CD and make sure it works; if it does you can delete the cue and bin files from your PC.  2. You can convert the image file into a number of ordinary program files by opening  it  using  special  software  like  VCDGear  it’s  free ,  which  then converts it into a standard movie MPEG file  it will even convert into DivX for you . To download the program go to www.vcdgear.com download.html and download the latest available version – v3.56 last time I looked. When you  have  successfully  converted  the  cue  and  bin  file  to  .mpg,  you  can delete the cue and bin file if you don’t intent to burn them to CD.  You can also burn the .mpg files as  S VCD with Nero.   VCDGear – Main page  r a e G D C V   VCDGear is incredibly easy to use. Just click on the ‘load’ button to find the cue  and  bin  files.  Then  tell  the  program  that  you  want  a  cue bin  to  mpeg conversion   the  standard  option ,  then  press  ‘Start’  and  eventually  your  cue files will be converted into a nice, easy to use MPEG file that can be played as normal on any computer.  VCDGear  206   5 – Digital Video  Daemon Tools  If it’s not a movie but a game that’s been downloaded and compressed you can download an alternative free tool called Daemon Tools: www.daemon-tools.cc   Open  Daemon  Tools,  click  the  icon  in  your  system  tray  and  select  ‘mount image’, then select the .cue file and it will be mounted to a virtual drive  this means your PC thinks that it’s an actual CD in the CD tray, but in fact it’s a .cue .bin file on your hard drive, opened by Daemon Tools and mounted as a virtual drive .   Playing video Files in the Living room All this talk of codecs, weird file types and compression, slightly obscures one nagging problem: they’re all PC-based. How do you watch all this compressed content in the lounge, on a TV, rather than on a PC?  Like many, I do have a PC with a good LCD screen, but I much prefer relaxing in the lounge  or on the hammock  a long way from the study where the PC lives. Surely, the big risk is that all these clever wizzy codecs and compressed film files will be doomed to sit chugging away on our PCs, never to emerge in the lounge living area in a viewable format?  Step  forward  the  next  generation  of  smart  home  electronics  devices.  I’ve selected three rather clever devices to show what’s ultimately possible with a small amount of money and common sense. With each and every one of these devices you can release your compressed DivX files from their PC home and start watching films in your living room.  I’ve  detailed  each  of  the  products,  with  a  rough  guideline  price  from  my favourite cheap electronics website  www.ebuyer.com , but don’t get too hung up on the actual specific devices  or the website as there are plenty of good alternatives .  The  point  is  that  each  of  these  types of  devices  can  play compressed video in your living room.  LiteOn DVD player  The LiteOn DVD player is perhaps the easiest way of getting DivX  or XviD  material into your living room. On one level it’s a simple DVD player – at the  207   The Downloader’s Handbook  back of the player, there’s a scart lead that connects into your TV. All you need do is put a DVD in, switch on and it’ll play.   The trick, of course, is to get the DivX files onto your DVD. To do this, simply find the DivX files on your hard drive, then transfer the files into a burning program like Nero. To do this, open up Nero Burning ROM and then select a New  Compilation.  Make  sure  it’s  set  to  DVD  ROM   UDK ISO ,  then  drag  and drop the files onto the blank disc. Next, select the ‘burn’ icon. You should be able to fit 6 DivX films on one blank DVD disc.  LiteOn LVD-2010 DivX DVD Network Player Inc Wi-Fi Adaptor.  Price on www.ebuyer.com at the time of writing: £85  This LiteOn player also hints at another possibility, using the WiFi adaptor to stream files over your own home network. I wouldn’t recommend this option for novice users but the principle is the same – instead of dumping your DivX videos onto a disc, a server that works inside the machine goes through your home network and finds the DivX files. It then streams over the network onto your TV.  Tip: Make sure that your DVD player can play both DivX and XviD files. This  should  come  as  standard  in  this  sub-market  of  smart  DVD players but make sure before you buy.  LaCie Silverscreen   The one big downside with these cheap DVD players  some retail for as little as £30  is that you still have to use blank DVDs. You can of course use recordable DVDs, burn the files on, and then erase them after you’ve watched them. But there’s still this problem of fiddly discs lurking around. One way around this is to use mobile hard drives that connect to your TV in exactly the same way as a DVD player. The LaCie drive is simply the best of the bunch but also the most expensive – you can buy these systems for under £100.  These are incredibly simple to use. It’s a hard drive that has a USB slot in one end and a slot to connect to a TV in the other. You load it with DivX and XviD films from your PC  an 80GB drive should take over 100  and then disconnect  208   5 – Digital Video  it, walk into your lounge, fix it up to the TV using audio visual leads  scarts  and then switch it on and navigate through the menu to find your film.  Sounds too good to be true?   It isn’t. These devices work brilliantly although, in my experience they can be a little iffy playing some files that haven’t been correctly encoded.  Creative Portable Media-Centre 20GB MP3 Mpeg   Price on www.ebuyer.com at the time of writing: £185  It’s  a  fairly  similar  story  with  the  last  device,  one  of  the  new  generation  of portable media devices that operate in the same way but are designed to be used out and about. They also feature a hard drive that connects to a PC for uploading films, and they also have a way of playing the content on a TV. The clever  bit  though  is  that  they  have  an  in  built  battery  power  supply,  which means you can watch the films out and about using the very nice colour screen. It’s the most expensive option but it’s truly portable and you can play music and  look  at  photos.  The  only  downside  is  that  not  all  these  portable  media players can handle DivX movies.  Backing-up your DVDs Would you like to back-up your DVDs?  Forget about it unless you have the right tools.  Luckily, these tools are often free, and easy to use, although you won’t find them heavily advertised outside techie circles. Applications like DVD Shrink or ratDVD suddenly open up a whole new multimedia world – they give you the opportunity to back-up all your DVDs onto a single external hard drive that can be used as the basis of a new home entertainment centre of the future.  What do you need?  Not very much, except a bit of clever software and a DVD burner. The DVD burner is an obvious accessory, plus one of three different programs. In this chapter we’ll talk you through each of these tools, all of which have a slightly different approach to backing up your films.  209   The Downloader’s Handbook    DVD Shrink    Gordian Knot  The wonderful DVD Shrink will compress your movie down to a file size that can be burnt onto a back-up DVD or filed on a hard drive.     This tricky but fantastic little program will compress your DVD into a single compressed file using DivX that can then easily be stored on a hard drive. ratDVD The  even  trickier,  but  even  more  spectacular,  ratDVD will  do  the unthinkable. It will take all the extras and menus on a DVD plus the film, compress it to heck, and turn it into a 1GB file that can be stored by the dozen on your hard drive and used for later playback.  The above three programs are free and should take no more than an hour or so to master.  Some DVD basics You need to understand two simple but not insurmountable problems.     Your movie DVD cannot be copied straight onto another DVD using a  burner Stick the film DVD into your hard drive and go to ‘My Computer’ and right click  on  the  icon  that  shows  the  movie  DVD.  Select  ‘Explore’  and  then check  how  many  gigabytes  this  movie  is  using  on  the  disk.  You’ll  be surprised  to  learn  that  even  though  DVDs  have  a  stated  capacity  of  just under 4.5GB, your movie is in fact well over 5GBs. Clone or copy it onto another disc and it just won’t fit. That’s because film companies use special technology  that  means  that  most  DVDs  actually  store  between  7GB  and 9GB.  Luckily  all  the  programs  in  this  chapter  use  powerful  compression technologies that squeeze the original files down so that they total less than 4.5GB.  That  means  the  compressed  files  can  then  be  burnt  onto  a  blank disc.    Most DVD films are encrypted  Your  favourite  film  DVDs  will  probably  boast  some  form  of  copyright protection,  which  prevents  you  from  either  copying  them  to  your  hard drive, or, if you do manage to do so, stop them from playing the resulting files.  This  protection  changes  over  time  and  the  names  used  by  the  210   5 – Digital Video  encryption  engines  vary  considerably   you  might  see  Macrovision mentioned a lot , but the good news for most consumers is that they’ve all been cracked at one time or another. Two programs stand out as brilliant decrypters – AnyDVD and DVD Decrypter.   Step 1 – Cracking DVD encryption  Want to learn how to crack the copyright protection on DVDs?   AnyDVD  Your first step is to visit the site of software vendor SlySoft  www.slysoft.com  and browse through the features of AnyDVD.  It’s the only software in this chapter that’s not free – it costs just under $40 – but it’s worth every penny. Let’s call it the best bit of stealth software you’ll ever need, and best of all it’s available on a free trial for 21 days.  Install the program as normal and you’ll be surprised to see that AnyDVD never really  does  anything  obvious  on  screen.  That’s  because  it’s  a  background program that systematically strips all DVD files  and audio music CDs for that matter  of their copyright protection on your computer. Shove in a DVD film and  it  will  play  and  copy  across  perfectly  with  no  annoying  copyright warnings.  DVD Decrypter  DVD Decrypter is the freeware rival of AnyDVD. Its great advantage is that it is free and it’s astonishingly easy to use. But its developers aren’t upgrading the software and it’s only a matter of time before it stops working as new film titles boast new layers of copyright protection. At the moment though it’s a fantastic bit of technology that works perfectly.   211   The Downloader’s Handbook  Program profile – DVD Decrypter  User What it is  Why bother  Source Difficulty How long will it take to master  What does it do?  Experienced A free program that rips copyright protected movies  onto your hard drive It bypasses all the DRM that stops you copying  movies for back-up purposes www.afterdawn.com Easy Ten minutes  Unlike AnyDVD,  it  doesn’t  operate  quietly  in  the  background,  running unobtrusively as an adjunct to media player programs. It’s designed to rip the film  files  of  a  DVD,  and  dump  them  into  a  folder  on  your  PC,  whilst  also breaking through the copyright protection on the DVD. To download it, visit the  www.afterdawn.com website  and  search  for  the  latest  version  of  the software.    Once  installed,  place  a  DVD  in  your  main  PC  drive  and  open  up  DVD  Decrypter.    After a few seconds reading the DVD, the main DVD Decrypter screen pops     up.  Click on the ‘Mode’ menu at the top of the screen. You’ll now see three main choices – let’s concentrate on the top two, File and IFO. If you choose File, DVD Decrypter will take all the files off the DVD and dump them in a specified folder. This is great if you want to copy all the extras and menus but the resulting files will be huge! The IFO option automatically targets the files on the DVD that contain only the main movie  which is usually broken down into a series of 1GB files .   212   5 – Digital Video    When you’ve chosen which set of files to copy across, simply click on the little folder icon under ‘Destination’ and select where you want to save the files to, and then hit the ‘DVD-to-Hard Drive’ icon and DVD Decrypter goes to work – roughly 30 minutes later the file has been copied across and all copyright protection removed.    But  be  aware  that  once  you’ve  ripped  the  files  you  still  need  another program to do something with them. Whichever Mode you choose you’ll still have files that are too big for any blank DVD to handle. You’ll need one of the next bits of software to convert the files into something that’s usable.  Step 2 – Compress the files to burn onto a blank disc  DVD Shrink  DVD Shrink is quite the easiest piece of video editing software you’ll ever run into.  It  uses  DVD  Decrypter to  rip  the  content  of  the  DVD  movie  and  then special software to compress your film files into a folder that’s small enough to fit on one single blank DVD.  213   The Downloader’s Handbook  Program profile – DVD Shrink  User What it is  Why bother  Experienced A free program that rips copyright protected movies  onto your hard drive and then shrinks them into a  file that’s big enough to fit on one blank DVD It bypasses all the DRM that stops you copying  movies for back-up purposes and then compresses the film files  Source Difficulty How long will  it take to master  www.dvdshrink.org Easy Ten minutes  To get  the  software,  simply  visit  its  main  home  page  at  www.dvdshrink.org. Click  on  the  US UK  flag  and  it’ll  take  you  to  the  home  page  of  this  rather wonderful little tool. This eminently sensible little website doesn’t bother with huge long tomes about its software – it knows it’s great, easy to use software, so simply follow the links to the download page.        Click on the ‘Where’ button and you’ll see a Google search box to help you find a site to download it from. It’s worth noting that the volunteers behind DVD Shrink have stopped development work on it so 3.2.0.15 is probably the last reliable version of the software.  Click  on  any  of  the  mirror  sites  and,  in  a  few  minutes,  you’ll  have  the software ready to install. Install the software as usual and then insert a DVD you want to copy.      Now run the software.    Click  ‘Open  Disk’.  A  new  screen  will  appear  –  this  says  ‘Open  DVD’  and gives you a short title for the DVD. Click ‘OK’. The software now analyses the DVD. Tick the ‘Enable Preview’ box and you’ll see it whizz through the various video components including the opening menu.  214   DVD Shrink – Analysing  5 – Digital Video  k n i r h S  D V D   215   The Downloader’s Handbook  DVD Shrink – Details     Eventually,  after  about  two  to  three  minutes,  it  will  finish  analysing  the DVD and our original screen with new details added to it will appear.  k n i r h S  D V D     You’ll now be given a bunch of different options. The key bit of information is at the top – the big green line. Hopefully this line will be entirely green with no  red  –  that  means  DVD  Shrink can  compress  the  files  below  the  crucial 4475MB limit. This is the capacity of most consumer DVDs used for burning – anything above that and the content won’t fit onto a standard DVD.    On the right side you’ll see a box with ‘Compression Settings’ on the top. All  you  care  about  is  that  it  says  ‘Automatic’.  Below  that  you’ll  see  a percentage. That tells you the amount of compression in use – if it says 58% for example, that means that it’s compressing to 58% of the size of the  original  and  is  well  within  the  safe  limits  of  compression.  In  my experience you’re OK down to around 40%.   216   5 – Digital Video    Next you’ll see various audio options. This is simply the list of all available audio  streams.  In  some  cases  you  can  have  the  normal  2  channel  plus further surround sound options. You might also have options for foreign languages – if you do, you can safely ignore these and uncheck them. Lastly, there’s the sub-picture options, which are the subtitles. They don’t take up much space so keep them.        On the left side of the screen you’ll see some little boxes that include ‘Menus’  the various opening menus of the DVD , the main movie, and any extras like  ‘The  Making  of...’  You  can  choose  to  have  all  or  none  of  these  by unchecking the main movie. If you click on the various boxes you’ll see all the various episodes options revealed. Click on any of the options you want.  DVD Shrink – Backup DVD    When  you’re  done  click  on  the  ‘Backup’  tab  at  the  top.  You’re  now presented with a new bunch of options. The first line tells you which DVD burner you’ll be using – if you have Nero, DVD Shrink will manage the burning of the new back-up disc as well. In the absence of Nero, you can simply  shrink  the  files  into  a  folder  and  then  use  another  burning application to handle the ripped files.  k n i r h S  D V D   217   The Downloader’s Handbook    Next you can set the ‘temporary’ location of the Backup files on your hard           disk.  The DVD Region option allows you to make your new back-up disc region free, thus avoiding any future headaches if you happen to take the DVD abroad for instance.  In  the  Quality  Settings  area  you’ll  be  presented  with  two  main  options: Perform Deep Analysis and Error Compensation. The deep analysis option will encode your DVD in two passes. This will take significantly longer, but it  may  be  worth  it  because  it  will  certainly  improve  video  quality  by allowing  DVD  Shrink to  better  distribute  the  required  compression throughout  the  various  scenes  in  your  DVD  and  it  will  ensure  that  DVD Shrink accurately meets the target size.  Error  compression  is  used  to  clean  up  the  final  picture.  When  video  is compressed, small errors or artefacts are introduced. This is an unavoidable consequence of video compression, and DVD Shrink can’t stop this from happening. However, it can keep these artefacts to a minimum. The best option is probably the default one, Sharp, which will tend to preserve the sharpness of the original video.  If you are concerned about speed, don’t enable any of these options – your back-up will be completed in just over an hour.  The last few options are straightforward. In ‘Options’, make sure the program runs in Low Priority and in Burning check that it’ll run at maximum speed.   You are now ready to go! Press ‘OK’ and DVD Shrink does its thing. It will probably take at the very least a few hours. My advice is to run this overnight. Eventually you’ll be prompted to supply a blank disc for burning – if you left the main program running overnight, you’ll probably discover it’s been looking for a blank disc for hours, but don’t worry. Simply open up the disc drive, take out the original DVD and put in a blank. It’ll then see the new disc and start burning.           Gordian Knot  DVD Shrink may be wonderful but its final output – the compressed files – will still be huge, many gigabytes in size. Also the final result will be a classic DVD – it  plays  like  any  other  DVD.  That’s  great  if  you  want  to  play  it  in  a  DVD player, but it’s less useful if you want to store a back-up of all your best DVDs on a hard drive.  218   5 – Digital Video  Program profile – Gordian Knot  User What it is  Why bother  Source Difficulty How long will  it take to master  Very experienced A free program that will manage the whole process of  converting your DVD films into a single 700MB  DivX XviD file It manages all the ripping, bypassing copyright  protection and compressing gknot.doom9.org Complicated One hour plus  If your end game is to store dozens of movies on one 80GB hard drive  you could fit a hundred or more compressed films on a single back-up drive  your best  bet  is  to  use  compression  software  that  shrinks  a  multi-gigabyte  movie into  a  700MB  file  using  either  the  DivX  codecs  or  XviD. Step  forward  the complex but elegant Gordian Knot.   This free software started out as a simple bitrate calculator for DivX encoding, but has evolved to become an integrated package, or ‘front end’, for the entire process  of  DivX XviD encoding.  In  fact,  when  you  download  the  software, you’re actually downloading a whole collection of packages and codecs that have all been integrated into one user interface.  Warning: As software goes this is quite complicated. It’s not one of  those  desperately  easy  ‘click  this  button’  pieces  of software.  But  it  works  and  once  you’ve  mastered  the process  you’ll  find  it  awesomely  powerful.  Only  for experienced users!  219   The Downloader’s Handbook  Downloading and installing  The first step is to download this free software.   Go  to  gordianknot.sourceforge.net and  click  your  way  through  to  the Downloads section. There you’ll see the latest file releases in the centre of the page. The Rip Pack, includes a number of bits of software that will manage the process of copying across the DVD files, decrypting them and then converting them into a video format that can then be compressed. The second package, a codec  pack,  contains  all  the  tools  you’ll  ever  require  to  compress  the  files. Download both.  Install the Rip Pack first. On set up you’ll come to a screen that prompts you to choose the different components of the installation. Keep them all ticked and press ‘OK’. The set up software will now install the various components that include  mysterious  items  like  BeSweet  and  VobSub.  Don’t  worry  too  much about what’s being installed, it’s all incredibly useful!  Next, install the codec pack that controls the compression side of the package. Again, a number of packages will be installed – click yes to them all.  After a few minutes all the packages will be installed. You’re ready to compress your films!  First time set up  The  first  thing  to  do  is  to  make sure  that  all  the  programs  that  work  with Gordian Knot are properly installed and that Gordian Knot knows where they’re located.   Start Gordian Knot up. Find the program paths tab at the top of the screen and make sure  that  all  the  key  programs  have  a  proper  pathway  specified  –  if they’re  not  there  you  can  simply  use  the  ‘Locate’  button  to  go  into  your programs folder on your hard drive and locate the .exe file that launches the program  usually it has a small symbol telling you what this .exe file is .  Now that you’ve checked all the programs are properly integrated into Gordian Knot, let’s click back on the first tab on the top: Ripping. You now have two choices – you can use ‘Rip & Process’ to process the files on the DVD in ‘one pass’. Effectively, this little tool runs the whole process for you. Personally, I don’t  use  this  function  as  I  found  it  just  as  easy  to  run  all  the  key  ripping programs individually to make sure that everything is working fine.   220   5 – Digital Video  Compressing in four easy steps  Step 1 – Rip files from the DVD  The first challenge is to work out how to rip files from the DVD. We’ve got to get  the  files  off  the  DVD  and  onto  our  hard  drive  and  also  get  around  the encryption so that we can store video files on our computer for later processing.   Gordian Knot – Ripping page  Click on the gold disc under ‘Rip VOBs’  the technical name for the format DVD films are stored in . DVD Decrypter now starts up.   t o n K  i  n a d r o G   221   The Downloader’s Handbook  The program reads your DVD and works out what’s on the disk – on the right side of the screen you’ll see the various components under VTS. The software will usually choose the longest bit – the film – plus, in a box below, you’ll see all the chapters ticked  they should all be ticked, just make sure . Problems can arise if there are, say, two movies on the same disc or if there’s an ‘extra’ – say a film about the making of – which is as long as the actual film. If this is the case run the DVD and make sure you work out what exactly is the main film file.   Next, you choose the location of the ripped files on your computer. I usually create a folder on the desktop with the name of the film – if you want to do this just double click on the little folder icon and tell the program what folder to save it in.  Now press the big button at the bottom on the left side with a DVD symbol, an arrow and the symbol of a disk drive. The program will now take something like 30 minutes to rip and decrypt the film. After it’s finished just check in your chosen folder to see if the VOB files are all listed in there.  222   5 – Digital Video  Step 2 – Turn it into a vStrip file  Next go back to the main Gordian Knot window and click on the icon below the DVD Decrypter – the symbol with an eye called vStrip. This little program gathers together all the files you’ve ripped and puts them in the right order, in one, single file.  Click  on  the  main  vStrip button.  You  now  need  to  add  the  files  you’ve  just ripped onto your hard drive. Locate them using the ‘Add’ tab midway down the page and pick all the files you’ve just ripped.   Now look at the top of the page again and you’ll see a second tab next to the Input tab called IFO. DVD Decrypter also ripped a special little file called an IFO file, which is a bit like a music playlist. It’s a file that tells the DVD machine in what order to play all the components of the DVD – the main film, the extras and the chapters within each of these. You need this so that all the VOB bits on your hard drive play in the right order. Go to where you saved the VOB files and you’ll see an IFO file. Add it to vStrip.  Lastly, go back to the top of the page and locate the Output tab  next to the IFO tab . Click on it and you’ll see where vStrip is about to save the files to – Output Name. Use the button here to give it a name. I usually call it the vStrip file and put it in the same folder as the rest of the ripped files. Make sure the Remove Macrovision box is also ticked  this removes the copyright protection  and press Run. In about 20 minutes your files will be ready.  Tip: Because DVDs have so much content on them beware that you are ripping the main feature. It’s not always the case that the VOB files marked  VTS_01 are  the  right  files  –  the  film  company  may  have called the main files VTS_03, or frankly anything under the sun.   223   The Downloader’s Handbook  vStrip – Main page  Step 3 – Prepare the vStrip file for compression  You should now have a big vStrip file in the main folder you’ve ripped your film to. The next stage is go back to the main Gordian Knot front page  to our ripping section  and go down the page to the ‘Prepare the VOBs’ section which boasts a small button with a brightly coloured strip of film on it.   This program now gathers together the vStrip file and other bits and pieces and puts  them  together  in  a  special  file   called  D2V   that  can  be  used  by compression software. The instructions for the use of this quick little program are on the main screen but I’ll just recap them.     Press ‘F3’ and select the vStrip file you’ve just created. Click ‘OK’. Now press ‘F5’ for a preview, let it run for a while to make sure it looks okay, then press ‘ESC’.  224   5 – Digital Video     If Framerate is 25 FPS  PAL  and Video Type is FILM at a percentage higher or equal to 95%, check ‘ForceFilm’ in Field Operation, otherwise make sure it is not checked. In Dolby Digital check ‘Demux All Tracks’. Finally press F4 to save the project file. This will take a few minutes.  Step four – Compressing the files  OK, so we have our D2V files saved in a folder. It’s now time to compress these huge files down to 700MB or even less.   At the bottom left hand side of the main Gordian Knot window you’ll see a button  marked  Open.  Select  the  D2V  file  you’ve  just  worked  on.  A  preview video screen will now appear with an image from around the middle of the film – minimise this for now. Now go back to the top of the screen and look for a tab marked Bitrate. A new screen will appear.   Gordian Knot – Bitrate page  There’s loads of information again here but the relevant bits relate to the codec you’re going to use. It’s basically a question of working out which codec you want: XviD and DivX 3.11 or 5? Most specialist DivX compatible DVD systems will play all types of files. In my experience the safest bet is to use DivX 3.11  the most compatible with different players , the best looking video is DivX 5 and XviD is a great all round alternative. Whichever format you choose, you can effectively leave all the other boxes as they are.   t o n K  i  n a d r o G   225   The Downloader’s Handbook  Using all the presets, now bring back the screen with a preview of the video on it. At the bottom of this screen you’ll see a button called Save and Encode – press it.   Save .avs  t o n K  i  n a d r o G   A new  window  called  Save  .avs  appears.  If  you’re  using  subtitles  this  is  the chance to make sure the subtitles are included  see the next section on adding subtitles . If you don’t have any subtitles simply press ‘Save and Encode’. You’ll now be asked to give your final compressed film a name and select a folder.  A new encoding box appears – in this example we’re going to use the simple DivX 3.11 codec.   226   Gordian Knot – DivX Encoding Control panel, DivX 3  5 – Digital Video  In the middle of the screen you’ll see two tabs called Audio 1 and Audio 2 – the stereo sound channels. Select Audio 1. A series of options now appear. You need to tell Gordian Knot where to find the audio files you’ve been ripping. Press the Select button and you’ll see that inside the main folder, where you’ve been saving the D2V files, that there are some weird looking file names, usually called something like AC3T01 – open this file.   Now look to the lower right side of this Encoding Panel and you’ll see that the audio file has been loaded up. You’ll also see that you can click on an option called  MP3  custom  parameters.  A  series  of  complex  looking  ‘Transcoding Parameters’ will now load up. Use them all.  t o n K  i  n a d r o G   227   The Downloader’s Handbook  Gordian Knot – DivX Encoding Control panel, Audio 1  t o n K  i  n a d r o G   Go to the tab marked Audio 2 and repeat this process. Once you’ve done this, you’ve successfully loaded up your audio files.  The last step is to go back to the DivX 3 tab and press a button called Add Job To Encoding Queue.   Time to wander off to bed! Overnight, Gordian Knot will now juggle together all the programs and start the compression process. When you come back the next morning you should have a new small, compressed movie file ready to be transferred to your hard drive.  Using the DivX5 codec  If you want to use DivX 5, the procedure is almost exactly the same except that you’ll also be offered the chance to set the parameters by which DivX will encode the files. One of the tabs will now say DivX 5. Click on this and you’ll see two  228   5 – Digital Video  buttons in the section called DivX 5 Codec Settings: First Pass and Nth Pass. These options dictate how many times the DivX codec works on your compression.   Click the box entitled First Pass. A new screen will now appear showing the settings for DivX.  DivX – Settings  i  X v D   For most of the time you can just click ‘OK’ and leave the settings as standard  with average bit rate at 483 and encode mode multipass, ‘1st pass’ selected . Gordian  Knot will  now  take  you  back  to  the  previous  box,  called  Encoding Control Panel. Press on the Nth pass button and repeat the process with the same settings as before.   229   The Downloader’s Handbook  Remember to click on the Audio 1 and Audio 2 boxes, selecting the right audio file and choosing MP3 Custom parameters as described above. With both the audio and video encoding settings ready, it’s time to go back to the DivX 5 tab and select ‘Add Job to Encoding Queue’. Gordian Knot will now go away and start compressing the file.   Note:  If you want you can follow the same procedure to encode using XviD as an alternative codec.  Adding subtitles before you compress the files  If,  like  me,  you’re  a  bit  of  a  foreign  language  junkie  you’ll  also  want  the subtitles that came with the DVD. In my experience watching Korean action flicks when you don’t understand the language is a bit tricky, though highly amusing. Gordian Knot has a solution, as you’d expect.   With the DVD still loaded in the machine go to the main Gordian Knot page and look at the top of the page for a tab called Subtitles Chapters.  Gordian Knot – Subtitles   Chapters  t o n K  i  n a d r o G   230   A rather complicated page full of detail now emerges. Ignore most of it and go straight to the button that says Configure.  5 – Digital Video  Filter: VobSub  A new screen opens up called Filter:VobSub. Click on the ‘Open’ button and then navigate your way to the DVD player  usually given the initial D: by the XP operating system . You’ll now see two sets of files on your DVD: the video  TS  files and the audio  TS  files.   Double  click on  the  Video  box  and  you’ll  see  a  blank  folder.  Don’t  panic  if you’re  expecting  to  see  a  bunch  of  subtitle  files.  Look  at  the  bottom  of  this ‘Open’ box and you’ll see that it’s been told to only look for VobSub files, of which there aren’t any. But if you click on this ‘Files of Type’ section you can also tell it to look for IFO files that can eventually be made into the necessary VobSub files. You’ll now see a list of IFO files – pick the one which controls the main feature  usually the biggest file in terms of data size .   The program will now prompt you for a place to save the subtitles file that it’s about to create – in my experience, choose the same folder you’ve saved the ripped files to.   You’ll now see yet another box open up.  231   The Downloader’s Handbook  Select PGC  This  is  entitled  Select  PGC  –  it  lists  all  the  potential  languages  the  disc  has subtitles for. Using the little arrow keys in the middle send all the languages you don’t want back to the left column so that you have only one language left  English in this case . Once you have that one language left press ‘OK’ and the program will now rip out the subtitles, prepare them  it’s called indexing  and then save them as a text file in the chosen folder. This takes quite some time so be prepared to brew many a cup of tea!  232   Filter – VobSub  5 – Digital Video  Eventually, when the program has finished preparing your subtitles, you’ll see a new screen entitled Filter: VobSub, with a big red box. You’ll also see another small text box with the chosen language inside – in this case 01-English – plus some other options that include the transparency of the subtitles. You can now play with the colour of your subtitles by choosing ‘Custom Colours’ and align the position of the subtitles.  When you’re ready press ‘OK’ to save the resulting subtitle text files to your chosen box and you’re ready to go. To include the subtitles in your finished product, go to the main Gordian Knot Bitrate screen. Open up your project as described below  open up the D2V file and choose your compression codec  and then wait for the video preview box to come up.  Once you’ve made your various tweaks  for framerate, quality and so on  hit ‘Save and Encode’ on the Video preview box. A new box called Save .avs will appear. Midway  down  the  left  hand  side  of  this  screen  you’ll  see  an  option entitled  Subtitles  VobSub. Tick  the  Select  VobSub box,  navigate  through  to where you saved the subtitle file, and select it  if you see two files by chance there  pick  the  largest  one  in  file  size  terms .  Keep  the  box ‘Before  Resizing’ ticked.  Now  go  to  the  bottom  of  this  particular  window  and  ‘Preview’  the subtitles on the film. A small Windows Media Player will now open up and you’ll  see  your  subtitles  previewed  against  the  video.  If  you  don’t  like  the colour  or  position  you  can  go  back  into  the  VobSub program  and  edit  the subtitle files.  233   The Downloader’s Handbook  Step Five – Compressing your whole DVD to a single 1GB file  ratDVD  How about taking your film DVD and compressing it to hell so that it turns into a 1GB file that also includes all the extras and menus built into a DVD?  This is the promise of ratDVD; a great piece of freeware that promises to be the ultimate film DVD back-up solution. It’s a better option for backing up films than Gordian Knots compression because you get to keep all the extras. It’s also a better option than DVD Shrink for back-up enthusiasts because your end file is relatively small – at around 1GB – and is so small you could store upwards of 80 film DVD back-ups on one small 80GB external drive. And what’s more you can still play these compressed DVDs – the ratDVD files – on your PC using Windows Media Player, plus you can also use the software to uncompress the ratDVD file and turn it back into a full, working DVD title.

Insert a movie in your DVD drive and then open up the program. ratDVD does not come with its own decryption software – although there is apparently a third party hack available called RAT Decrypt. This means  234   5 – Digital Video  you can’t use ratDVD to rip the film straight from the DVD if it has any form of copyright protection installed, and you’ll still need DVD Decrypter to get the encrypted files off your DVD and onto your PC. Open up DVD Decrypter and go straight to Mode. Choose ‘File’ – this downloads all the key files from the DVD onto your hard drive. In ‘Destination’, set the folder you want to store the files in, and then click on the main DVD to hard drive icon. 30 minutes later your files are ready to be converted using ratDVD.     Time to go back to ratDVD. Click on the ‘Open files’ folder at the top left side of the main page. Now locate your ripped files. Now open the main menu file called Video TS.IFO.  235   The Downloader’s Handbook  ratDVD – DVD to ratDVD conversion  D V D t a r      You’ll  see  all  the  various  elements  of  your  ripped  files  including  the subtitles, the extras and audio tracks. You can now click on any of these options and click Remove or Keep. Unless your DVD folder is huge  close to 9GB  I’d keep most of the extras and options, only getting rid of any useless foreign languages.    You’ll  now  notice  a  slider  bar  under  the  ‘Content’  heading.  It’s  called Destination Size and this lets you choose the eventual size of the files. Slide it close to 50 and you’ll get a file under 1GB but with lousy quality, while if  you  slide  it  close  to  125  you’ll  get  superb  quality, but  the  file  will  be about 2GB. In my experience a setting of around 90 is fine. That’s it! You’re ready to compress. Click on the DVD to ratDVD symbol at the bottom right side of the page. The software is slow and will take at least 5-6 hours to convert, so I’d leave it running overnight.       When it’s finished you’ll see a single, hugely compressed ratDVD. To check it’s OK, double click on the file and play it within ratDVD – hit the play icon in the middle left hand side of the screen.   236   5 – Digital Video  Tip: Very occasionally ratDVD may save the final file in a file type that no media  player  can  recognise.  This  means  it’s  finished  all  the compression  but  the  file  type  is  incorrect  and  most  media  players won’t be able to see the file. Don’t worry – just right click on the final file, and select rename. Keep the main name but simply add .avi at the end of the file. The file will now read properly in all media players.    You can also reconvert the ratDVD file back into a full set of DVD files for burning. Simply open up ratDVD again, and use ‘Files’ to select the ratDVD compressed file. You’ll see all the details of your file come up now, and at the  bottom  of  the  screen  you’ll  see  a  new  button  with  ‘ratDVD to  DVD’. Click  on  this  button  and  leave  overnight.  At  the  end  you’ll  have  all  the original files decompressed, ready to be burnt onto a DVD.   ratDVD – ratDVD to DVD conversion  D V D t a r    237   The Downloader’s Handbook  In this chapter we learnt how to play video on a PC, and also about all the weird types of video file. You read about  and promptly forgot!  odd names like XviD – don’t worry, there’s no test at the end of this. You also learnt how to back-up DVDs. You’re getting pretty good at this digital video lark by now. But you can’t consider yourself an expert just yet. For that, you have to get through the next chapter, which explains how to download video files on the internet. So, without further ado, let’s get onto file sharing networks.  238   6  File Sharing Networks    6 – File Sharing Networks  Content galore, pity about the law Imagine  a  series  of  networks  based  around  the  internet  where  you  could download millions of different files – music, film, software – all for free. It’s no socialist utopia, but a grim reality for the entertainment and software industries – global  online  communities  like  BitTorrent,  eDonkey and  Gnutella are  the decentralised hubs of a new world of free digital content, shared over what are called  peer-to-peer networks   P2P .  It’s  all  great  news  for  internet  users,  but terrible news for the corporations that own the digital content!  Every  day,  tens  of  millions  of  users  download  and  upload  files  for  every imaginable  type  of  content.  Some  of  that  content  is  free  of  copyright  and entirely  legal,  but  most  of  it  is  copyrighted  material  that  legally  belongs  to someone else and is being shared in an unauthorised fashion, globally.  Before we go any further, it’s important to say that file sharing technology, and the networks themselves, are not necessarily illegal. Far from it, in fact. Many big software houses, like Microsoft, are hard at work building clever tools into their  operating  systems  that  allow  perfectly  legal  file  sharing,  between  work colleagues, for instance, or between offices.  The  problem  with  the  file  sharing  networks featured  in  this  chapter  is  that much, if not most, of the content on these networks is illegal – very simply, it shouldn’t be there! We’ll talk about the legal position of these networks and the files on them in a later chapter, but the bottom line is simple: share files over networks like BitTorrent and technically, in most countries, you’re breaking the law. That doesn’t mean you’ll get caught or that there aren’t some arguments in favour of file sharing copyrighted material, but it’s the reality. It’s illegal but millions of people use the networks anyway. In fact, tens of millions!  It’s also important that you realise that many of these networks are full of:  1. Fakes – bad  and  corrupted  files  that  are  next  to  useless  and  frequently  placed on the networks by operatives of the entertainment industry.  2. Files full of viruses and software full of spyware. We’ll talk about this very  real threat in the next section.  3. Hackers desperate to get past your security and corrupt your system. One quick reassurance on this theme though: if you follow one simple rule you should be able to stop this particular threat dead in its tracks. Apologies for  241   The Downloader’s Handbook  repeating this yet again, but never, ever, visit a file sharing network unless you have a fully operational firewall.  Note:  So let’s be very clear before we carry on: before you use a file sharing  network  understand  clearly  that  your  downloads   and uploads   might  well  be  potentially  illegal  and  not  without hazard or danger to your own computer.  But there is a big upside that goes with these risks, namely that virtually any film or album you’ve ever wanted is probably on one of the networks, for free. All you have to do is to work out which network to use and how to get the file without landing yourself in gaol or spending hours cleaning up your PC.  In this chapter you’ll:  Learn the principle behind file sharing networks. Learn how to work out which network to use.  1. 2. 3. Discover the wonders of BitTorrent. 4. Work out how to use the slightly more complicated eMule network.  What exactly is a file sharing network? Most  commentators  use  a  number  of  interchangeable  terms  to  describe  the burgeoning world of file sharing. You’ll see talk of peer-to-peer networks  P2P , file sharing and even decentralised, distributed computing – for the purposes of this chapter though they’re all the same thing. Whatever technology or network you end up using, they’re all probably built on the same foundations.  242   6 – File Sharing Networks  Version 1: FTP  In the time before P2P, something called file transfer protocol  or FTP  was the very first incarnation of file sharing and involved you going on the internet to find a file and then requesting to download that file from a central computer, or server. That server almost certainly belonged to someone else and you either had to have their permission or pay for the privilege. Even worse, if you and a thousand other people converged on the same server at the same time and tried to download the same file, it would have probably keeled over unless it was a very big computer with loads of bandwidth.   Version 2: P2P  Napster style.  Modern  file  sharing  networks try  to  do  away  with  all  this downloading from a central server nonsense by distributing the file over many different computers on a network  i.e. the internet . The problem is then how to organise that distribution and then find the files.   Step forward a certain Shaun Fanning in late 1999.   Apparently all that Mr Fanning wanted was a nice and simple way of finding decent  music  over  the  internet  without  having  to  trawl  through  instant messaging  systems  or  web  search  engines  like Lycos  and  Google  to  find someone who had posted some music on their website. Clever young man that he  was,  he  worked  out  a  series  of  technological  innovations  that  led  to something called Napster. Although it’s worth pointing out that other systems like IRC, Usenet and Hotline had been around a little earlier with similar goals and  objectives,  Fanning’s  genius  was  to  develop  his  own,  specially  designed software that centralised the indexing of all the music tracks on his network.   Here’s how it worked.  If you were looking for a digital copy of a music track, you’d transmit a search request to the Napster server, where the software would conduct a text search of the centralised index for matching files, and the search results would then be transmitted to the requesting user. If the results showed that another Napster user was logged on to the Napster server and offering to share the requested music, the requesting user could then connect directly with the offering user and download the music file.  243   The Downloader’s Handbook  Big, legal mistake!  Why? Fanning’s servers were obviously owned by his company and it was clear to  all  and  sundry   except  his  lawyers   that  they  were  indexing  content  that shouldn’t be there and, what was worse, Napster’s management clearly knew what  was  going  on.  Within  two  years  his  network  had  been  shut  down  and Fanning was forced to close the Napster servers and sell up – ironically to a media giant called Bertelsmann who reopened the service a few years later on a legal, paid-for basis.  Version 3: The new generation of P2P  Unfortunately  for  the  music  industry  –  and  later,  the  film  companies  –  the genie was now well and truly out of the bottle as other developers started work on a new generation of networks that were much more decentralised and less vulnerable to legal assault. In these decentralised indexing networks, each user maintains an index of only those files that the user wishes to make available to  other  network  users.  Under  this  model,  the  software  broadcasts  a  search request  to  all  the  computers  on  the  network  and  a  search  of  the  individual index  files  is  conducted,  with  the  collective  results  routed  back  to  the requesting computer. This clever model is used by software  like Morpheus  that is  based  on  a  set  of  open  source code  called  Gnutella,  which  allows modification of the software, subject to some restrictions.  A rival  soon  appeared  based  on  something  called  the  supernode model,  in which a number of select computers on the network are designated as indexing servers.  The  user  looking  to  search  for  a  file  connects  with  the  most  easily accessible supernode, which conducts the search of its index and supplies the user  with  the  results.  Any  computer  on  the  network  could  function  as  a supernode if it met the technical requirements, such as processing speed. This technical  architecture  was  developed  by  a  bunch  of  programmers  behind  a company called Kazaa, who in turn made pots of money by building a hugely popular network called Grokster.   But the techie types were still on edge, as the anti-piracy watchdogs could still attack  the  companies  that  operated  these  supernodes  and  marketed  the network. If you really want to stay under the anti-piracy radar you’d need an even more decentralised model with technology that could cope with all these massive, new film files emerging.   244   6 – File Sharing Networks  Cue Bram Cohen’s BitTorrent system, which debuted back in 2002.  The world according to BitTorrent is one based on swarms of computers, all acting as servers. The basic principle behind this kind of network is that all the files  typically films  are broken down into much smaller fragments  under a half  MB  each   that  are  distributed  to  the  peers   you  and  me   pretty  much randomly  and  then  reassembled  on  a  requesting  machine.  Each  peer  takes advantage  of  the  best  connections  to  the  missing  pieces  while  providing  an upload connection to the pieces it already has.   Without getting too technical, its genius is that it breaks huge files down into manageable  packets  that  can  then  be  distributed  in  a  swarm-like  fashion around  the  internet.  This  overcomes  another  key  worry;  that  of  bottlenecks emerging  bandwidth, the measure of capacity on the internet is not unlimited after all . It does this by cleverly turning all that increased demand into yet more bandwidth as your computer is turned into yet another server that can help new entrants.   Which networks to use? If it all sounds a little too good to be true, it is. It costs money to develop many of  these  technologies  and  market  the  networks,  money  that’s  certainly  not going  to  come  from  all  those  file  sharers  who  are  only  using  the  network because it’s free.  So, companies like Kazaa turned to novel ways of making money. Advertising soon made an appearance on its network, usually in a highly annoying and obtrusive  fashion.  The  owners  of  these  networks  also  worked  out  that  the software  that  was  installed  on  your  computer  could  also  be  loaded  with wonderful  little  extras   spyware   that  could  be  either  slipped  in  without  any mention, or referred to as a useful adjunct to your internet search and shopping experience  spyware again .  In  essence,  that  means  many  of  these  networks  are  infected  with  horrible spyware, like Gator, that purports to help you but is in fact spying on you and making your life difficult. Luckily, the net is also full of well-meaning users who spend a lot of their time checking whether the software that comes with these network installation packs is infected or clean.   245   The Downloader’s Handbook  Step forward the excellent folks at SpywareInfo who’ve compiled a handy list of all the networks and the accompanying software that’s infected. You can see the full list at www.spywareinfo.com articles p2p  but in the table below I’ve summarised the chief villains.  File sharing networks – ones to avoid  iMesh  Audiogalaxy BitTorrent Ultra Warez P2P Bearshare  free version  MediaSeek  Morpheus before version 4.9.2  Edonkey prior to version 1.2  Source: Spywareinfo.com  FreeWire LimeWire before 2004 Grokster  My advice is simple – don’t bother using any network or software client that’s infected. That means avoiding Grokster, LimeWire, Bearware and early clients of Edonkey.  Luckily there are also an equally large number of networks and software clients that are clean – here’s the SpywareInfo list.   File sharing networks – the clean ones  WinMX Soulseek  Shareaza Direct2Connect  Filetopia  Morpheus  after version 4.9.2   eMule BitComet, Torrent  Storm, BitTornado, and TorrentSEarch,  Azureus  all BitTorrent clients  Ares Lite  Source: Spywareinfo.com  246   6 – File Sharing Networks  Choosing which of these clean networks and clients to use boils down to three simple factors:  1. How easy is the software to use?  The bottom line here is that it’s really not worth touching a client  software program  that’s complicated to use. That rules out the various IRC-based clients,  of  which  the  best  is  something  called  AutoXDCC that  lets  you access a fantastic treasure trove of content, but it’s fiddly and difficult to use unless you know lots about internet relay chat. It’s a similar story at the excellent Direct Connect – great client, loads of users on the network, but best avoided by novices.  2. How much useful content is available on the network?  The Ares network looks hugely promising and is very easy to use, but at the moment the number of users is still fairly limited. It’s a similar story with Filetopia and Soulseek.  3. How fast are the downloads?  The various BitTorrent clients win hands down on this score, while eMule is a veritable tortoise by comparison.   That leaves us with just four serious contenders: Morpheus, WinMX, eMule and the various BitTorrent clients.  In this section we’re going to concentrate on just two networks: BitTorrent and the eMule client on eDonkey.  Why not Morpheus or WinMX?   File  sharing  network  Morpheus used  to  be  the  clear  market  leader,  but  the number of files available has dropped dramatically in recent years and its also become popular with the wrong sorts, who in turn have placed loads of dodgy files – viruses and malware – on the network. Its past popularity also made it a major target of the anti-piracy authorities and its owner is facing a string of legal actions designed to shut it down.  To  be  fair,  Morpheus has  many  things  going  for  it  –  it  uses  the  excellent Gnutella network and is incredibly easy to use – but I’d avoid it simply because there are better, faster, easier to use alternatives out there, although if you’re really determined to use it we have included a small section  starting on page  247   The Downloader’s Handbook  269  on Morpheus basics, plus a quick look at LimeWire, another, once popular, network that’s worth a look if you don’t mind loading up some spyware.   WinMX was, and quite possibly still is, a great network, but back in September 2005 it appeared that it had shut down. By the time you read this book, WinMX has probably come back online via some clever work-around, but its prospects don’t look great. It’s also not quite as easy to use as the BitTorrent and eMule clients and its best content is pretty much limited to music and software.  BitTorrent vs eDonkey  The  BitTorrent and  eDonkey networks   only  use  the  eMule client   are  both sturdy, reliable survivors, jam-packed full of content with easy to use clients that are free of spyware.   Table 6.1: Comparison of BitTorrent and eDonkey networks  Network  Advantages  Disadvantages  BitTorrent  Downloading files is incredibly quick.  A little fiddly to use.  There’s an astonishing quantity of files.  eDonkey eMule  Slightly easier to use Boasts an astonishing number of files catering to an enormous variety of tastes. It’s the place to go for alternative tastes and old films and music.  There’s a vast amount of content available, but it’s usually only the most up-to- date releases. It’s not great for esoteric and slightly less mainstream content.  Downloading can take much, much longer as it operates a queuing system. Heavily patronised by non- English speakers and especially Germans. That means it can ack depth when it comes to Anglo-Saxon music and film.  248   6 – File Sharing Networks  Note: My advice is simple – use both networks!        BitTorrent – the new kid on the block In  little  more  than  three  years  BitTorrent has  emerged  as  the  dominant  P2P client and the new Public Enemy Number One of the film and music industry. BitTorrent is unique in several respects:  It’s a smart network Whereas most file sharing systems allow you to download and upload files from  one  source  at  a  time,  BitTorrent cleverly  takes  chunks  of  data simultaneously from anyone online who has it. And where P2P used to be about sharing individual music tracks, the combined power of BitTorrent and broadband means you can download the entire Beatles catalogue or an entire TV series as a single compressed file in just a few hours.     No central servers as targets  The problem for BitTorrent’s opponents is that there are no central servers storing the files or allocating their distribution, thereby depriving them of an easy, legal route to shutting down the network. BitTorrent also dares to have an agenda. It has an anti-spam and anti-porn policy and, touchingly, allows users to make one-click donations to the PayPal account of Bram Cohen, its 29-year-old designer, who has  so far  resisted the temptation to sell out to big business before the lawyers close in.  Share bandwidth and get more The  network’s  agenda  positively  discriminates  against  ‘leechers’  —  those who download files and give nothing in return. By tracking your download and upload speeds, you receive progressively slower downloads the more you  tweak  your  settings  to  restrict  upload  bandwidth.  This  leads  to  a genuine community spirit that does a better job of policing itself than other P2P networks.  Luckily for its opponents – and there are many – BitTorrent isn’t as easy to use as some other networks. It does have some other downsides of which perhaps the  biggest  is  that  its  content,  though  incredibly  broad,  is  not  actually  very deep. What this means is that its content is usually very contemporary – the  249   The Downloader’s Handbook  latest films, TV shows and albums – but if you’re after much more specialised stuff it’ll probably not be available. Other networks, like eMule, are probably a better  bet  for  a  much  deeper  range  of  back  material   we’ll  talk  about  this network next  but if you’re after the latest thing then BitTorrent is for you.  BitTorrent lingo  Many users are put off using this fantastic network by the strange language that is used by the network’s varied developers. Don’t be. BitTorrent does take a bit of getting used to but it is, in reality, a doddle to use.   First, lets get our head around some of the terms used.   Seeder This is simply someone who has the complete file and lets others download it using BitTorrent. But a seeder is also someone who leaves the file going after they’ve finished downloading it.  Leecher This is someone who is downloading a file but hasn’t finished it yet. Reseed This is used to describe the process where someone seeds a torrent again after  they’d  already  finished  and  closed  it  earlier.  This  is  done  when  a torrent has many leechers, but no seeder. This is a great way to help out the community of BitTorrent users as others can now finish their download and then seed again.  Tracker An application run by the person who runs a BitTorrent website. It controls the up downloads of the torrents which use the tracker’s web address or url. Peer Someone who is uploading and or downloading a torrent. Generally a peer does not have the complete file, otherwise it would be called a seed. Some people  also  refer  to  peers  as  leechers,  to  distinguish  them  from  those ‘generous’ folks who have completed their download and continue to leave the client running and acting as a seed.                 250   6 – File Sharing Networks        Torrent This is the small data file you receive from the web server  the one that ends in .torrent . It contains the information about the data you want to download, not the data itself – this is what’s sent to your computer when you click on a download link on a website. You can also save the torrent file  to  your  local  system,  and  then  click  on  it  to  open  the  BitTorrent download. This is useful if you want to be able to re-open the torrent later on without having to find the link again. Swarm The group of machines that are collectively connected for a particular file. For example, if you start a BitTorrent software program like BitComet  see below  and it tells you that you’re connected to 10 peers and 3 seeds, then the swarm consists of you and those 13 other people.  Putting together all the jargon  You  should  now  be  able  to  build  a  picture  in  your  mind  of  how  BitTorrent works.   The  main  building  block  is  that  there  are  people   seeders   who  upload  the digital  content  to  a  website  to  which  they  apply  a  tracker  that  controls  the traffic  in  the  file.  These  files  are  then  scanned  by  clever  BitTorrent search engines that are a bit like Google – they send electronic spiders over the web to search for BitTorrents and then present the compiled list of available files to other users who could be either seeders or leechers. These seeders and leechers then  get  to  work,  downloading  the  BitTorrent tracker  file   which  tells  them where the file is and how to use it  from the website identified by the search engines, pushing the content out over the web in a matter of minutes. These users  in  turn  act  as  suppliers  of  content  to  leechers who  simply  download content without ever actually providing content for further redistribution.  251   The Downloader’s Handbook  What you’ll need  To run BitTorrent requires a number of key tools:  1. You  need  a  clever  search  engine.  Many  have  been  shut  down  but  a  few major  sites  like  www.torrentspy.com and  www.isohunt.com keep  going, barring  the  inevitable  legal  threats  from  the  anti-piracy police.  I’ll  show you how to search for content below.  2. You need a program that controls your uploading and downloading. There are  plenty  of  programs  available,  ranging  from  the  original  BitTorrent program  itself  all  the  way  through  to  highly  optimised  programs clients such as BitComet that are very easy to use.   3. You might also decide to seed content. Again you might need a special bit of  software  –  in  this  case  we’d  use  a  very  popular  little  program  called Make Torrent. This is a fairly complicated procedure for file sharing novices and we won’t go into it here – if you want to master seeding a download, visit krypt.dyndns.org:81 torrent maketorrent  where you’ll also find a FAQ and User guide.  How to search for BitTorrent content  Let’s see if we can download the latest episode of a popular US TV show, West Wing.  We’re looking for this kind of content because TV shows make for reasonably small downloads – 350MB – compared to film files which start at 600MB and can end up being as big as 1.5GB in size.  TorrentSpy  Our first stop is the website of TorrentSpy – www.torrentspy.com.  252   TorrentSpy – Main page  6 – File Sharing Networks  There’s absolutely nothing complicated about TorrentSpy. It’s a straightforward search website that looks for all kinds of BitTorrent content – legal and illegal  although the website does say that it conforms to the US copyright laws by condemning illegal, copyrighted files .  On  this  big,  very  long  page  you’ll  see  a  long  list  of  reviews,  news  and  user comments and stats, but the key box is at the top – Search.  If you want to run a very simple search you could simply type in ‘West Wing’, but lets be a little more specific and double click on the Advanced Search link.   y p S t n e r r o T   253   The Downloader’s Handbook  TorrentSpy – Search page  y p S t n e r r o T   We now see a number of filters that allow you to be more specific with your search. As it’s a TV show we’re looking for, click on the ‘Filter By Category’ drop-down and select TV. You can also specify the file sizes and the number of seeders and leechers using this file, but lets just keep it simple. Type in ‘West Wing’ in the main search box.   You’ll now see the results of your search – hopefully, a long list of available files. These can range from huge files that contain all the episodes in a series through to individual episodes.   You’ll also be told the size of the file – the bigger it is the longer it takes to download – and the number of seeders and leechers using the file  the more the better .  You’ll  also  be  told  the  number  of  files  within  the  file  you’re downloading – this can range from 1  a simple AVI video file , through to more than 50 if a zip archive tool such as WinRAR is being used.  Lastly,  there’s  a  very  useful  Health  column  with  coloured  indicators  –  green means the file is easy to access and in good health, while red means it’s difficult to access and is probably not worth the bother.   254   Click on the healthiest file, which in our case is the series 6 collection – this means the file contains all series 6 episodes. Click on the file.  6 – File Sharing Networks  TorrentSpy – Results  You’ll now be given the opportunity to download the torrent file – you’ll also be given a lot more information about the file. You’ll be able to see when the file was first added, exactly how many seeders and downloaders there are plus, further down the page, you may also find a section of comments by users. This is incredibly useful as it tells you if the file is a fake – someone is bound to announce this, usually in big capital letters followed by an expletive or two – or if the file is corrupted in some way. Double click on the Download Torrent file. You’ll now be asked to save the file. Create a folder inside My Documents called My BitTorrent files and save the file in this newly created folder.  y p S t n e r r o T   255   The Downloader’s Handbook  TorrentSpy – Downloading  y p S t n e r r o T   We now have a BitTorrent file that will tell us where to download the file from, but  at  the  moment  it’s  completely  useless  to  us  as  it  stands  –  we  have  no program that tells our computer what to do with it. We need to download a BitTorrent client program.  BitTorrent client programs  There are an enormous number of BitTorrent clients freely available and many of them can do some pretty amazing things, but for simplicity I recommend getting BitComet.   To find BitComet go to www.download.com and search for ‘BitComet’, or go direct to the BitComet website at www.bitcomet.com.  Download the file as normal, letting it install an icon on your start menu and desktop. It will then prompt you to run the program – click ‘Accept’.   Almost immediately your firewall program will tell you that BitComet is trying to install itself and connect to the web. Allow the BitComet client software to connect to the internet  remembering to tick the ‘Always’ box if your firewall  256   6 – File Sharing Networks  software allows, so you don’t have to keep telling the firewall to authorise the client .  You’ll now see the main BitComet window. On the left side you’ll see a column which starts with ‘All Tasks’ and then ‘Torrent Sites’. This latter section is a list of all the BitTorrent search engines, though beware as search sites open and close with great regularity.  TorrentSpy – Search engines  Now go back to where you saved the West Wing torrent file. Double click on this tiny little BitTorrent file. A new window opens up giving you details of this torrent file using BitComet.  y p S t n e r r o T   257   The Downloader’s Handbook  Just press ‘OK’ and BitComet goes away and starts downloading your files. The program will also minimise itself. If you want to check on the progress of the download at any time you can go to the bottom right side of your screen where you’ll see the icon for BitComet. Double click on this icon and BitComet will appear again. You should now be able to see your download file with a green arrow pointing down  that means it’s downloading  and some columns that will tell you the size of the file, and the download and upload speed. You’ll also be told how long it will take to download the file at the current speed.  It will probably take a few minutes for BitComet to contact all the seeders out there and arrange the download  or swarm  so don’t be surprised if the speed starts very slow and then builds up.   If you want to change anything about the download – deleting it for instance – just right click on the file name. You’ll see a number of options that include ‘Remove’.  Once  you’ve  finished  downloading  your  file  you  can  choose  to Remove either the ‘Task’  stops it being seeded  or the files as well.  If you do stop BitComet and then want to restart it again, you’ll have to restart your downloads. To do this simply right click on the files you want to restart downloading and select Start.  258   6 – File Sharing Networks  In the later versions of this client there’s also a button on the top screen of the program that will let you preview the files you’re downloading.   Firewall problems  If  you’re  using  a  software-based  firewall,  you  need  to  enable  incoming connections so that they can deal with BitComet and other clients. If you’re still using only the most primitive of firewall programs – the one supplied free with Windows XP – you’ll need to configure the software to let BitComet through safely.  This  means  you’ve  got  to  open  up  some  of  your  communication channels – or ports – for BitComet using Windows XP firewall. To do this:    Open the Network Connections folder  Start > Control Panel > Network and     Internet Connections > Network Connections .  Click the shared connection or the internet connection that is protected by Internet Connection Firewall, and then, under Tasks, click Change settings of this connection.     On the Advanced tab, click Settings. For each port you wish to forward,  i.e. 6881, 6882... 6889  do the following: On the Services tab, click Add, and enter all of the following information; in Description of service, type an easily recognised name for the service, such as ‘BitComet’. In Name or IP address  of  the  computer  hosting  this  service  on  your  network,  enter 127.0.0.1   this  means  ‘the  local  machine’ .  In  both  External  and  Internal port number for this service, enter the port number, e.g. 6881. Select TCP, then OK.  If  you’re  running  proper  firewall programs  like Sygate or  ZoneAlarm,  you should be prompted to open up these channels by the software.   Tips and tricks with BitTorrent     Change the location where BitComet downloads your files – go to Options, at the top of the screen and then select Preferences. Here you’ll see all the various options for running BitComet – in the left column you’ll see ‘Task’ with a small folder symbol next to it. Click on this and then double click on the first option in Download that says Default Download path. You can now change the location of your shared and downloaded files. I use a folder called My Shared Files, which all my peer-to-peer programs download files to.  259   The Downloader’s Handbook     If there are no seeders there are no files to download. Look for files with plenty of seeders and downloader’s leechers.    Really  do  look  at  the  comments  on  a  search  engine  like  TorrentSpy.  If someone says ‘Fake’, ‘Virus’ or ‘Crap’ use your common sense and avoid it. There’s also a remorseless logic to popular files – by and large the more seeders downloaders there are, the more likely that the file is healthy and uncorrupted. If the health indicator in TorrentSpy is red and there are not many people using the file, investigate and probably avoid.     You’ll also encounter some rather weird file formats. The most common are .rar, .cue and .bin. Typically you’ll download what you think is a big file inside  a  folder. When  it’s  complete  you  look  inside  the  folder  and  see dozens of different files with these initials at the end. Don’t panic! They’re all just ways of compressing and managing data files – our earlier chapter about video talked about opening up .RAR files. It’s  common  sense,  and  we’ve  already  laboured  the  point  in  an  earlier chapter, but always run a virus check on all the files you download. Do not go blundering into a file hoping it will be OK – scan it first.     260   6 – File Sharing Networks    Be  particularly  careful  about  foreign  language  movies.  Unless  you’re  an accomplished  linguist  you’ll  soon  run  into  trouble  with  dubbed  films. Usually you can check the comments left behind on the search engines or even inspect the name of the file  it might say ‘Italian’ for instance – which is a bit of a giveaway for Italian language . These might be dubbed with no subtitles. Unless you speak Italian it’s likely to be useless.  eDonkey eMule  What is eMule?  Back in 2002, a clever chap called Merkur decided that the existing peer-to- peer programs  were  dreadful,  especially  the  early  incarnation  of  a  network called eDonkey. As is the way with these techy types he was convinced he could do  better. And  he  did.  He  gathered  his   developer   disciples  around  him  and they built the second best peer-to-peer system on the planet, entitled eMule – according to the site it was so called because a Mule was ‘somehow similar to a donkey’. It was built on the existing eDonkey infrastructure but it boasted lots of new features and a user-friendly interface and it’s completely free of any spyware or malware.  eMule is  a  great  P2P  tool.  Compared  to  its  rivals  it  boasts  a  number  of  big advantages:              It’s hugely reliable and its myriad of servers located all around the world make  sure  that  the  network  is  up  and  running  no  matter  what.  That reliability  also  explains  why  it’s  recently  become  a  target  for  the  anti- piracy police. Its main user interface is very easy to use and understand and has loads of useful features. The  network  itself  boasts  huge  amounts  of  content.  This  is  its  biggest advantage  over  BitTorrent –  eMule’s  users  are  much  more  likely  to  be cultivated,  intelligent,  sophisticated   aka  non-American   types  who  like world movies or strange unheard-of bands. eMule makes  use  of  a  number  of  other  networks  including  ED2K,  the Source Exchange, and Kad.  261   The Downloader’s Handbook    You can preview content – that means you can see a video file even before     it’s finished downloading.  eMule also boasts another nice feature in its Queue and Credit system. This makes  sure  that  everyone  in  a  queue  will  get  the  file  they  want  by promoting those that upload back to the network.   How to install and use eMule  Download the eMule software from its website – www.eMule-project.net.    On the home page you’ll see a link to ‘Download’. Click to download the  latest release of the software – currently version 0.47a.    After the main installation, run the program for the first time. You’ll come to the configuration process. First it will ask you for a user name  make one up and don’t use your own name, ever!  and then you’ll be asked to check the  communication  ports  used  to  run  the  program.  You’ll  spin  through various other options – you can accept all the defaults for these.   Eventually you finish the configuration process and you’ll find yourself on the main page of eMule.   eMule – Main page  262  l  e u M e    6 – File Sharing Networks  Don’t  start  using  the  program  yet.  In  the  main  window  you’ll  see  a  list  of servers  that  you  can  connect  to  using  eMule.  This  will  probably  be  a  rather short  list  –  and  it  certainly  won’t  include  the  most  powerful  and  popular servers.  For  that  we’ve  got  to  go  back  online  and  visit  http:  ed2k.2x4u.de . Here you’ll find three choices – the connect list, the best servers and all servers. You’ll also see the option to add any of these to eMule. In my experience you should go for the Best Servers and Add to eMule – all the addresses of the most popular servers will now be added to your server list.   With your extended server list we’re ready to connect to a server. Personally I prefer  to  connect  to  the  most  used  servers  as  these  probably  have  the  most content on them. To find this out click on the column in the server list that says Users. The server list will now be filtered on the basis of the most popular first – which usually means one of the Razorback servers, although be aware that the anti-piracy police in the Netherlands have recently shut down some of the bigger Razorback servers.  Now right click on this server and select ‘Connect’. After a few seconds you’ll see that you’re connected in the ‘My Info’ box in the bottom right corner.   Congratulations – you’re on the network!  Before  we  start  looking  for  files,  let’s  make  sure  we  have  selected  the  right configuration options.   263   The Downloader’s Handbook  You can now tell the program which folders you want to share with it.      Click on the drives or folders. You should also select one main folder in which you store all your incoming and temporary files. As with BitTorrent I’d reset this to a specific file called something like ‘My P2P Shared Files’ in My Documents. That way, all your peer-to-peer content goes into one folder, which can be easily checked for viruses. Once you’ve selected the shared folder, click ‘Apply’ and then ‘OK’ and go back to the main screen.  Looking for a file  Time to start looking for a file.   Let’s start by seeing if we can download an episode of the West Wing again.      First click on the Search button at the top. This brings us to the main search page. Type in your search term and then hit ‘Start’.  264   eMule – Search page  6 – File Sharing Networks    You’ll  now  see  a  long  list  of  files  of  different  episodes  come  up.  The important  columns  are  in  the  middle.  One  says  ‘Availability’,  which  tells you how easily you’ll get hold of the file  a high number is good especially if it’s in blue , while the other says ‘Complete Sources’. This last column is hugely important as you really only want files that are complete – what’s the point of downloading incomplete files!    After filtering the files for their completeness, look down the Availability column and see what’s complete and has plenty of availability  if it’s in blue that’s good .     When  you’ve  found  your  file,  highlight  it,  and  then  click  the  download button at the bottom  you can also right click the file  and select download.  l  e u M e   265   The Downloader’s Handbook  eMule – Downloading  l  e u M e      To see how the download’s going click on the Transfers button at the top. Hopefully you’ll see your chosen file in the list there. You’ll see another bunch  of  columns  as  well.  First  you’ll  see  the  size  of  the  file  you’re downloading,  next  the  speed  of  the  download  when  it  eventually  starts, and then a progress bar. If you see any red in this bar, avoid the file – right click on it and choose ‘Cancel download’. Red means that bits of data in the file are unavailable – there’s no point in downloading these files as it’s not complete. The darker the blue, on the other hand, the better your chance of downloading. You’ll also see columns that tell you the amount of people who  have  the  file  online   clients  with  the  file   plus  your  status   it’ll probably  say  ‘waiting’  at  first   plus  the  amount  of  data  still  to  be downloaded.    At  the  bottom  of  the  screen  you’ll  see  a  separate  box  that  tells  you  the     number of people who are downloading from you.  Lastly, you’ll also see a couple of little ‘i’ symbols next to some download files  in  the  transfer  section.  Most  of  the  time  these  should  be  green  in colour  –  they  are  comments  made  by  other  users  about  the  files  you’re  266   6 – File Sharing Networks  attempting to download. A lot of them will be in foreign languages but you should easily spot words like ‘FAKE’ or German terms for excrement  very common with bad files in my experience .   Tips and tricks with using eMule   Don’t pen your eMule in!  eMule behaves like a server, and that means it wants to accept connections from  other  peers.  If  you  trust  that  eMule is  relatively  secure  then  you should allow it full access to the internet and not try and use your firewall program  to  restrict  access  to  the  internet.  If  you  use  a  firewall,  like ZoneAlarm,  allow  connections  in  both  directions  –  both  incoming  and outgoing. You can check how penned in your eMule is by looking at the bottom right of the client window: if you are connected to a server then the little icon should have green arrows round the logo. The Kad network This is an alternate way for clients to find each other rather than using the main ED2K server system  it’s a good idea to use both Kad and the ED2K servers .  There’s  not  a  great  deal  to  say  about  this,  just  turn  it  on  and connect it. To enable Kad go to Preferences > Connection and check ‘Kad’ in the bottom right corner. To connect to Kad should be simple, go to the Kad icon at the top of eMule and the first time press ‘Bootstrap’, it should just connect.        Be patient  You may well be wondering why your program has only downloaded a few Kbytes  in  the  last  few  hours.  The  answer  is  simple  –  eMule works  by downloading  off  clients  and  uploading  to  clients,  and  although  many people  do  run  eMule all  the  time,  they  also  probably  have  hundreds  of people in a queue waiting to download. And like all queues you have to wait your turn!  267   The Downloader’s Handbook  Other networks I make no apologies in this book for concentrating on the two best global P2P networks: BitTorrent  using the BitComet client  and eDonkey  using the eMule client . They’re both fantastic, full of content, and relatively easy to use.  But there are some perfectly viable alternatives worth exploring if you don’t mind taking on some extra risks. In this section we’ll quickly look at just three of them: Morpheus, Bearshare and LimeWire.  Each of these networks have their pros and cons.  Table 6.2: Comparison of Morpheus, BearShare and LimeWire  Network  Advantages  Disadvantages  Morpheus  It’s free of spyware in its  current version.  Has an enormous number of users with a vast amount of content.  The specific target of the anti-piracy cops and that means users are much more  likely to be targeted by legal actions.  It’s very popularity has also  made it a target for  unscrupulous peddlers in  fake files and malware. Software clients that are riddled with spyware.  BearShare and LimeWire with loads of content.  Well established user base  Easy to use interfaces that  make downloading very  straightforward.  On balance, Morpheus is probably the best of the bunch – although as I write this there are rumours that it’s about to close down!  268   6 – File Sharing Networks  Morpheus Morpheus used to be the king of P2P networks. Its genius was that it identified high-powered peers — those with fast CPUs and speedy internet connections — and  set  them  up  as  supernodes,  which  carry  information  about  the  lower- powered peers and help facilitate each search.   In a traditional, pure peer-to-peer network, a query would travel to and from each  individual  peer,  hogging  processing  power  and  bandwidth.  With Morpheus,  queries  go  to  the  supernode,  which  then  decides  whether  to  send them  down  to  the  lower-powered  peers.  Because  of  its  size  and  its  use  of supernodes, the Morpheus network typically gives you access to a wonderfully extensive, eclectic array of songs and other files.   To download the program go to www.morpheus.com and install as normal.  Morpheus – Front page  s u e h p r o M   269   The Downloader’s Handbook  Searching for files using Morpheus  Select which kind of media you want by choosing the ‘All Types’ option, then enter your search criteria and press Search. You can also run multiple searches and downloads at once!  s u e h p r o M   To organise and target your search, you can use the ‘Narrow Search’ option.   Tip:  If you are having difficulty finding the file you want, you should try again later by clicking the Search More button or leave a search result open. Each time someone is connected to the network, their server is scanned for files adding to the new results.   Sharing files  Morpheus includes  sharing  features  that  make it  easy  to  find  and  download content, but you need to make sure you only share the files that you are willing to allow other Morpheus users to be able to download.  Media files can be shared in two ways: within the My Files tab or directly from the Preferences button shown to the right. To share, go to ‘Preferences’, and then select Folders and select the Add button and then browse your PC and its disks to share individual folders and subfolders. Using the file chooser window,  270   browse to the location of the files that you would like to share, and select Open. Repeat this process to share multiple folders in different locations.   6 – File Sharing Networks  New tools within Morpheus  1. Parental control  The  latest  incarnation  of  Morpheus also  includes  much  improved  password- protected parental controls. This gives you the ability to add some extra layers of protection, security and preferences to your Morpheus experience.   To  access  these  functions,  navigate  to  ‘Preferences’  and  then  select  ‘Parental Control’. If this is your first time accessing these settings, you should create a password that is then used for all the functions in this area.   2. Proxy  Proxy servers  act  as  intermediaries  between  internet  users  to  protect  their identities  while  active  on  the  internet.  To search  for  free  proxies  visit www.proxyblind.org which  can  then  be  added  to  Morpheus by  going  to Preferences, and then selecting Proxy for anonymous downloading.   s u e h p r o M   271   The Downloader’s Handbook  272  3. Virus scan  You can even set up your virus scanner to automatically scan downloaded files from within Morpheus. Go to Preferences and then Antivirus. Click on Add and locate  your  virus  scanner  to  automatically  scan  every  completed  file  you download, adding a measure of security in keeping your computer safe. If you use  AVG,  the  address  will  probably  be  something  like  C:\Program Files\Grisoft\AVG6\avgse.exe while  Avast  will  be  C:\Program  Files\Alwil Software\Avast4.   6 – File Sharing Networks  BearShare Great network, pity about the spyware!  But don’t completely ignore BearShare if you’re after hard to find material not available on other networks as it does have an enormous amount of content lurking around on its network and may be worth a look if you can put up with the spyware.   To get the installation file go to www.bearshare.com, select Download Now and then hit the Free button to start the install file downloading. Install the program as normal.  Using BearShare  The first time you run BearShare, a set up wizard will open to configure your BearShare:             The first window will welcome you. Click Next. The  next  window  lets  you  set  up  preferences.  It’s  best  to  leave  as  the defaults and you can always change them later. Click Next.    Next select your internet connection. Click Next.   Now you’ll be shown where the files will be saved. To change, click Explore  or Browse and select a new directory. Click Next. The next window will show you which folders are to be shared across the network. It’s best to deselect all and then choose which you want one by one. Click Next. Click Finish.  A pop-up will come up with tips – these are often useful and worth reading. Now click Close.  Searching for files  Time to start searching…  Click the Search tab at the top left of the window.  Enter some keywords in the box titled Find. Also set the type of file you are looking for  audio, film, image, etc . You can use advanced criteria but this will narrow the search so you are more likely to end up with fewer sources. Click Search.  273   The Downloader’s Handbook  A list  of  the  searches  in  progress  and  completed  is  kept  on  the  right  of  the window. To move from one search to the next click on them. You will also be shown the number of hits to sources  x y  and the status of the search. It’s always best to wait till the status reaches 100% before starting a download to make sure the file you choose is the one with the most sources, as there can often be many different versions of the same file each with different numbers of sources.  BearShare – Searching  e r a h S r a e B      To start downloading, first check you have the right file. Look at the column on the far left of the main page – it gives you a visual representation of the number sources for each file. They show full when they reach 100 sources. By default the number of sources are shown on the far right column. You can  choose  which  column  to  be  made  visible  by  right-clicking  a  column header  and  checking  the  categories  that  you  want.  When  downloading choose the hit with most sources for the fastest download.    Obviously, check the file name in this search box but read the whole list of details. They are often very long but can reveal useful information about the file  i.e. a file might include ‘eng subs’ in its name .  274   6 – File Sharing Networks        Check the size of the file. After a while you get a feel for the size each file should  be.  For  example,  a  2hr  film  in  the  .avi format  is  about  700MB  written as 700 million in the window as the default is set to bytes  and a normal 3 min MP3 is usually about 3MB. To check that all your downloads are in order, click the Downloads tab next to the search one. It will show you how much has been downloaded of each file and give an ETA. These aren’t really that useful, but strangely addictive to watch.  Playing your downloads  BearShare does have a built-in player but it’s awful – it’s only worth using to check that you’ve downloaded the right file before opening another program. It’s far better to open with your preferred media player.     You  can  either  do  this  by  opening  the  file  from  where  it’s  saved  by browsing or setting up BearShare to do that for you. Click Setup> Options then check the box saying ‘Never in the Preview Play’ in theatre part.  BearShare – Playback options  e r a h S r a e B   275   The Downloader’s Handbook     Then all you have to do is click on the Library tab then double click on a file and it will open with its default player.  LimeWire Like  Bearshare,  LimeWire is  hugely  popular  with  loads  of  files,  but  it’s  also riddled  with  spyware.  To  get  it  go  to  www.LimeWire.com, click  the  link, choosing Get Basic. When you’ve downloaded the software, install as normal.     Run LimeWire from the start menu. The first time that it runs, a wizard will  open helping you set up your Kazaa. It will first ask you what language you would like. Click Next.      Next it will welcome you to the wizard. Click Next.    It will then ask you where you would like your files to be downloaded. This file will be shared. Click Browse to change from the default. Click Next. Then you will be asked to select your internet connection. Do so and click Next.       Next you’ll be asked if you want to start LimeWire automatically when you     start your computer. Choose and click Next. The next window will warn you that it’s about to access the internet and your firewalls will ask you if you want to allow LimeWire to access the net. Click Next and give LimeWire permission.   Once you’ve allowed LimeWire, click Next.    Then you will be asked if you want LimeWire to scan your drive for media files. Select No and click Next.    Now you’ve finished the set up. Click Finish.  Searching for files  To search for a file, enter the keywords into the Search box on the left of the window.   276   LimeWire – Search results  6 – File Sharing Networks     The results will be shown in the main window. The hits will have various columns of data shown with them. The fastest to download will most likely be the one with the highest number of sources.     Also check the file size to make sure that it is about the right size for the kind of file you’re looking for. A lot of information can be gained from the file name as well so read it carefully. To download one, double click it. To monitor your downloads, check the smaller window below. To monitor the uploads from your shared files, click the Monitor tab at the top of the window.       In this chapter we looked at file sharing networks – the black art of internet downloading. If you’ve got this far without skipping too much, bravo. Consider yourself a black belt in file downloading. But there’s one chapter left to read. It would be easy to skip over it – but that would be a mistake. So, take a deep breath, and let’s plunge into the surreal world of digital copyright.  e r i  W e m L   i  277    7  Copyright And The Law    7 – Copyright And The Law  Unless you’ve been living on Mars you might have noticed by now that the downloading  of  copyright  material  –  mainly  music  and  films  –  has  aroused huge global legal controversy. The US Supreme Court, the US Senate and the top commercial judge in Australia have all got in on the act and weighed in with new laws and judgments.  The core of the debate is simple. Many people who hold copyright on what’s called intellectual property or IP, such as musicians and film-makers, believe their ownership is being threatened by the new digital technologies outlined in this book. And although many musicians think that’s not necessarily such a big problem  see the section below on what musicians actually think  it’s hard not to accept that the copying of digital content has becoming insanely easy.  Despite  the  best  efforts  of  software  designers  working  on  Digital  Rights Management  DRM  systems, you can copy an album of music in under five minutes  and  a  film  in  under  an  hour.  And  if  that  wasn’t  bad  enough,  new broadband technologies and file sharing networks, like BitTorrent, allow you to send that copied file very quickly across the planet.  Luckily for most musicians and film-makers they have powerful lobby groups, especially  those  based  in  the  US,  that  have  taken  up  the  cause.  The  RIAA represents the main US music companies, while the MPAA battles on behalf of Hollywood, and both have considerable political and financial clout. In fact, their  lobbying  and  funding  grip  on  many  US  legislators  is  such  that  the  US Senate nearly passed one act that would have put copyright infringers in jail for up to five years, even if they had only backed-up one single album and then only  kept  the  one  copy  on  their  computer   a  situation  that  describes  many millions of average users in the UK .   And  the  legal  bottom  line  is  that  these  hugely  powerful,  and  vocal,  vested interests have a legal point. In nearly every country in the Western hemisphere the simple act of copying and distributing copyrighted material is in fact illegal. But  even  though  many  of  the  practices  described  in  this  book  could  be technically  illegal,  the  reality  is  that  the  vast  majority  of  us  will  never  be hassled by any lawyer or threatened by a legal letter.   In this chapter we’ll attempt to try and answer a number of commonly asked questions  about  what’s  right,  what  may  be  morally  wrong,  and  what’s definitely going to get you in trouble.   Let the questions begin.  281   The Downloader’s Handbook  Questions about copyright  Question  1:  What’s  so  wrong  with  using  other  peoples’  copyrighted material?  It’s only fair to say at this point that there are a number of perfectly respectable moral arguments that might dissuade you from copying music and film content from the internet. Perhaps the best summary of these was contained in a recent position by the British music industry federation, the BPI.  Here’s what the BPI chairman Peter Jamieson said:  “The unauthorised distribution of music over the internet is against the law. It infringes the legal rights of artists and record companies. And it’s bad for music. The British record industry, which is responsible for the lion’s share of the UK’s investment in new artists – in excess of £150 million  per  year  –  cannot  possibly  hope  to  continue  investing  in  new music if nobody pays for it. That’s a fundamental financial fact which even the internet cannot change. Whatever your views on unauthorised filesharing,  this  is  not  good  news  for  the  wider  music  industry  that currently employs around 126,000 people in the UK. Nor is it good for the thousands of talented British artists who hope that one day they’ll make a living out of their work…The record industry simply must act.”   There’s  a  number  of  different  arguments  advanced  here  but  in  summary  the BPIs perfectly reasonable case is that copying and file sharing of music and film:    …undermines the industry’s investment in new artists  The  industry  loves  to  quote  a  study  in  2004  that  showed  music downloaders’  spend  on  singles  and  albums  declined  by  59%  and  32% respectively  and  their  overall  spending  on  music  declined  by  one  third; among heavy downloaders this figure increased to almost half. This, they claim, is impressive evidence that prolific users of BitTorrent actually end up  spending  less  on  music  as  a  consequence  of  copying  other  peoples’ music tracks. Another study, by Forrester Research also concluded that 40% of  frequent  downloaders  buy  less  music  than  before  they  began downloading.   282   7 – Copyright And The Law     It’s an unreliable and unsafe way to get music Go to the big file sharing networks and you’ll constantly run the gauntlet of  viruses,  spyware,  poor  original  recordings  and  fake  files.  It’s  hard  to disagree with this, but guess who’s responsible for most of the fakes on the internet  –  step  forward  the  music  industry  and  their  use  of  firms  like Macrovision  that  use  a  technology  called  Hawkeye which  floods  file sharing networks with fake search results and bogus files on behalf of the music industry!    UK consumers DO have an alternative to illegal filesharing     They’re called Apple, MSN Music and Wippit.  Its against the law They’re right.  Question 2: Surely it’s legal to copy music from my CD onto my computer?  In the UK we have one of the strictest legal frameworks for protecting copyright on the planet. The bottom line is very simple: making a copy of a music CD or a film DVD in any shape or form is illegal.   And here’s the really annoying bit: even if you bought that CD, and even if it’s for your own use and you’re only copying it for use on your MP3 player, it’s still illegal. It’s even illegal for you to copy it to tape to listen to in the car. It’s all clearly an infringement of copyright.  Question 3: Hang on, but I thought it’s OK to back-up your stuff if it’s only for your own personal use?   Many people like to think that there’s something called ‘fair use’ that applies to personal back-ups of their own music CDs and film DVDs. The problem is that they’re wrong  in most nations at least , and they’re especially wrong if they happen to live in the UK. In the UK, the law – we’ll look at the actual Act in detail below – does allow certain very limited exceptions.   1. You are allowed to make back-up copies of computer programs provided they are for the original owner’s personal use. Copyright law in both the UK and the US allows for a single archival copy of any given commercial software  to  be  made,  for  use  only  if  the  original  fails.  Making  any additional copies for personal use is a violation.  283   The Downloader’s Handbook  2. DVD movies, however, as with CDs, can’t generally be reproduced in any way. But there are some exceptions here as well. Small extracts of a CD or DVD can be copied for academic use, for review or for news reporting. That doesn’t mean you can get away with a full copy of the film, but it does allow you to copy extracts for a public lecture on why horror films are bad for society, for instance.   3. You can also tape television and radio shows to watch or listen to at a later  time.  Question 4: All this talk of laws has got me worried – what does the law in the UK actually say?  If  you  have  some  spare  time  on  your  hands  and  you  fancy  examining  the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 in all its lovely detail go online to – www.hmso.gov.uk acts acts1988 Ukpga_19880048_en_1.htm  The key bits of the Act are in sections 17 and 18 and they state:   Section 17 – Infringement of copyright by copying   1  The copying of the work is an act restricted by the copyright in every description of copyright work; and references in this Part to copying and copies shall be construed as follows.   2  Copying in relation to a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work means reproducing the work in any material form. This includes storing the work in any medium by electronic means.   3  In relation to an artistic work copying includes the making of a copy in three dimensions of a two-dimensional work and the making of a copy in two dimensions of a three-dimensional work.   4  Copying in relation to a film, television broadcast or cable programme includes making a photograph of the whole or any substantial part of any image forming part of the film, broadcast or cable programme.  Section 18 – Infringement by issue of copies to the public   1  The issue to the public of copies of the work is an act restricted by the copyright in every description of copyright work.  284   7 – Copyright And The Law   2  References in this Part to the issue to the public of copies of a work are to the act of putting into circulation copies not previously put into circulation, in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, and not to—   a  any subsequent distribution, sale, hiring or loan of those copies, or   b  any subsequent importation of those copies into the United Kingdom;  except that in relation to sound recordings, films and computer programs the restricted act of issuing copies to the public includes any rental of copies to the public.  As we’ve already said, there are some exceptions to these clauses, that allow limited copying. These are in section 29 and they allow something called ‘fair dealing’ in the following circumstances.  Section 29 – Research and private study   1  Fair dealing with a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work for the purposes of research or private study does not infringe any copyright in the  work  or,  in  the  case  of  a  published  edition,  in  the  typographical arrangement.   2   Fair  dealing  with  the  typographical  arrangement  of  a  published edition  for  the  purposes  mentioned  in  subsection   1   does  not  infringe any copyright in the arrangement.   3  Copying by a person other than the researcher or student himself is not fair dealing if—    a  in the case of a librarian, or a person acting on behalf of a librarian, he does anything which regulations under section 40 would not permit to be done under section 38 or 39  articles or parts of published works: restriction on multiple copies of same material , or   b  in any other case, the person doing the copying knows or has reason to believe that it will result in copies of substantially the same material being provided to more than one person at substantially the same time and for substantially the same purpose.   285   The Downloader’s Handbook  You might also be interested to know how long these copyright protections last for:  Sound recordings – 50 years from first recording or publication.      Broadcasts  and  cable  programmes – 50  years  from  date  of  first     transmission. Films and motion pictures – 70 years from the death of the last survivor of the principle parties involved in bringing the production into being; the principle director s , screen writers, etc.  Question  5:  Is  it  illegal  to  download  music  from  services  like  iTunes  and Napster?  Here’s some good news. You’re in the clear if you use these services, as a limited form of copying is legal – there’s nothing in the law that stops you from using a legal download service such as iTunes or Napster as they specifically license you to use their copyrighted material.  But, and this is a big but, you may find that that license is very restrictive and may have Digital Rights Management  DRM  built into it. The restrictions in that license have nothing to do with the law as such, but are determined by the commercial  practices  of  the  service  operator.  Some  companies,  like  Wippit, have  a  remarkably  tolerant  attitude  to  how  you  use  their  music  downloads. With this kind of service you can transfer the MP3 track to your portable music player as many times as you want. You can even make your own copies for your own personal use and burn them onto a back-up CD.  But many bigger operators, and specifically Napster, have a very different, very much more restrictive attitude. They use a fierce form of DRM that is built into the software that controls the downloading of content and subsequent use of the  music  on  your  computer. DRM is  in  fact  a  catch-all  industry  term  to describe a number of technical methods used to control or restrict the use of digital  media  content  on  electronic  devices.  It  can  come  in  a  number  of different shapes and sizes. With expensive video editing software systems like Avid, for instance, you’re required to have a USB dongle that must be attached to the computer using the software, while some less expensive software systems require you to activate your software over the internet.   286   7 – Copyright And The Law  Movies also have their own, very varied, levels of DRM. Thanks to the different worldwide  release  dates  for  DVDs,  Region  Encoding  is  one  copy  protection mechanism you may be familiar with already. Another form of DRM is Content Scrambling System, or CSS, which is designed to stop you ripping data to your hard  drive.  Outfits  like  Napster and  Microsoft  use  another  form  of  DRM for online based services. These control the way you copy, convert or transfer the music  and  they  work  by  controlling  specific  activities  like  converting  your music  tracks  into  WAV  files  so  they  can  then  be  burnt  onto  a  CD.  For  that privilege you’ll have to pay extra!  Question 6: I’m worried by the rumours that there are technologies that will crash my computer if I try to rip a CD or DVD?  Some of you may like Celine Dion  although I can’t say I do  and some of you may even have bought her 2002 release called A New Day Has Come  not her best .   In  your  excitement  to  have  a  long-term  copy  of  her  work,  you  may  have decided to technically break the law and back it up onto your PC. If you had done so, you might then have encountered a particularly nasty form of DRM and you might also have encountered the blue screen of death  you know it by now: the computer freezes up, stops working and crashes…you curse...you have to run a reboot etc. etc. .   Dion’s music had been impregnated  so to speak  by a particularly zealous piece of DRM. The good news is that extreme DRM like this is still fairly rare, but the bad news is that the music industry is embracing DRM with increasing fervour.  But don’t despair!   Despite  all  the  grand  sounding  technology,  many  hackers  can  break  DRM systems surprisingly quickly. Computer science graduate John Halderman, for instance,  demonstrated  how  to  override  one  such  system,  SunnComm’s MediaMax CD3 protection software, simply by pressing the Shift key. Virtually every music CD on the market – including Celine Dion’s album – can now be broken using mass market ripping systems, and video-based DRM systems are also under assault from video hackers.   Halderman’s  clever  but  simple  work  around,  one  of  many, underlines  an important  reality  check:  despite  all  the  hype,  most  DRM is  actually  fairly  287   The Downloader’s Handbook  harmless and can usually be cracked. It’s also important to understand that not everyone even within the music industry is terrifically happy with this kind of technology.  The  giant  electronics  and  music  company  Philips,  for  instance, which pioneered the CD format with Sony, has hit out at the copy protection methods, and threatened to remove the compact disc logo from such CDs.   Warning: A warning on uncrackable DRM systems – the DRM used in online music services is much more effective and, to date at  least,  has  not  been  broken  or  hacked.  You  can’t,  for instance, buy DRM-based music  in the AAC format  from Apple’s  iTunes  store  and  try  and  convert  it  to  non-DRM MP3.  If  you  try, it  may  not  crash  your  computer,  but  it certainly won’t copy across and be playable in any device on planet earth!  Question 7: What happens if I distribute my copyrighted material  music or film  online using file sharing networks – will I get into trouble?  Imagine that you’ve ripped some music from a CD and you decide to upload that  music  to  a  file  sharing  network  using  something  like  BitTorrent.  Is  that illegal? The answer by now should be blindingly obvious: yes, it’s illegal! As the  law  stands,  all  distribution  of  music  and  film  that  belongs  to  another copyright owner is strictly illegal. More importantly, it’s also very likely to get you in trouble.   Here in the UK, the legal lead has been taken by an organisation called the BPI, which has specifically targeted uploaders. It started its campaign a few years back  with  some  sensible  emails  to  prolific  abusers.  The  reasonable  sounding messages pointed out that uploading other people’s copyrighted material was against the law and generally a bad idea.  Needless  to  say  most  dedicated  file  sharers  simply  ignored  the  message  and carried on regardless. A few months later the BPI started to get tough! They sent out a flood of threatening legal letters to a small hardcore of what they called  ‘serial  uploaders’,  who  offer  hundreds  if  not  thousands  of  music  files over the internet. The logic behind this is obvious. The BPI says 15% of file sharers are responsible for 75% of all songs swapped illegally, so if you stop the big uploaders who serially place music on networks like BitTorrent you’ll stop most of the illegal material.  288   7 – Copyright And The Law  And there are certainly some very serious serial uploaders around. The largest case  this  side  of  the  Atlantic  so  far  was  in  France  where  one  uploader  had 56,000 tracks  equivalent to more than 5,000 CD albums , in his online music library. But you don’t have to upload and make available thousands of tracks to receive a nasty legal letter. People who have uploaded even a few hundred tracks are in the spotlight in the latest legal cases.   The most recent legal campaign in the UK has focused on a bunch of music fans forced to pay up to £4,500 each and agree to accept injunctions against them illegally uploading music in the future. The 23 settlements came after a series of letters were sent out in October 2004 threatening future action. The offenders included seventeen men and six women, aged between 22 and 58, a student, the director of an IT company and a local councillor, with the average settlement of £2,000.   Here’s what the BPIs lawyer had to say:   “We  have  no  desire  to  drag  people  through  the  courts.  So  we  have attempted to reach fair settlements where we can. We hope people will now begin to get the message that the best way to avoid the risk of legal action and paying substantial compensation is to stop illegal file sharing and to buy music online, safely and legally, instead.”  So, that means settle up now and stop uploading or face a big court case.  Question 8: I hear that in the US the threats against uploaders have been even more severe – I don’t have to worry about that if I live in the UK do I?  The focus of most big, high-profile legal actions has been in the US, home of not  only  the  global  music  and  film  industry,  but  also  of  most  file  sharing network users and most high-profile electronic and technology companies. In the US, over 10,000 people have been threatened with legal action, and most of them have had to settle up and pay tens of thousands of dollars in costs.   The  US  has  also  taken  the  lead  in  a  number  of  other  battles  against infringement of copyright. The big music companies managed to shut down the first  really  big  file  sharing  network,  Napster,  in  2000.  After  a  lengthy  legal battle, the music industry managed to prove that the network itself – it was based on a centralised server that held details of all the music of all its users – was knowingly involved in the infringement of copyright.  289   The Downloader’s Handbook  Napster was only the first of a long list of targets carefully chosen by the music and film industry as part of a strategy to completely change the legal footing of  copyright  protection  in  the  US.  Their  biggest  success  has  been  something called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act  or DMCA . The DMCA, introduced in 1998, was designed to update American copyright laws to deal with the new issues posed by the internet and the proliferation of powerful multimedia home computers. The DMCA currently considers the bypassing of a copy-protection scheme  put  in  place  by  a  copyright  owner  to  be  a  criminal  act;  even  if  the person doing the bypassing purchased the copy-protected material legitimately. To put it simply, you cannot legally duplicate copy-protected material, even if you own it.   This section of the DMCA  chapter 12  has been massively controversial, since not only can it remove the right of consumers to duplicate their purchases, it also makes any tools that can be used to duplicate a copy-protected product in violation of the copyright of that product, and thus the makers of these tools become vulnerable to civil law suits. So if you’re a company selling software that breaks copyright protection of movies for instance, you’re in big trouble. Which is precisely what happened to a company called 321 Studios.   321 Studios  321 Studios  was  one  of  a  number  of  companies  that  supplied  software  that enables people to make perfect digital copies of films, but the movie studios argued  that  this  permits  illegal  copies  to  be  made  and  circulated,  infringing their copyright. In response 321 said the software allows people to make back- up copies of DVDs they have already paid for, and it fought its way through the US court system and lost. In its mission statement, 321 Studios, said that:   “Consumers who copy DVDs for their personal use are exercising their right of ‘fair use’ – an exception to copyright law that has been upheld by  the  US  Supreme  Court  in  order  to  avoid  an  irreconcilable  conflict between  copyright  law  and  the  First  Amendment’s  guarantee  of  free speech.”  Here’s how the software in question – DVD X Copy – worked. It allowed a DVD movie disc to be copied to a blank DVD, even though the compressed MPEG code on the disc is usually digitally encrypted using something called a Content Scrambling System  or CSS . CSS makes conventional copies unplayable. But DVD  X  Copy doesn’t  hack  the  CSS  protection,  which  would  explicitly  break  290   7 – Copyright And The Law  copyright  laws.  Instead  it  uses  a  conventional  software-based  DVD  player system to unscramble the MPEG code for legitimate playback, and then sends it to a temporary cache file on the PC’s hard drive. From there DVD X Copy copies the unscrambled MPEG code onto a blank DVD using a conventional DVD burner.   But DVD X Copy had one other big selling point. Most film DVDs are pressed onto dual layer discs with about 9GB capacity, while blank DVDs have only 4.7GB capacity. So to get a film onto a single over-the-counter blank DVD you need two discs for one DVD9  as it’s called  movie. DVD X Copy, along with other programs like DVD Shrink  which is much better and free!  get around this  by  adding  extra  compression  into  the  way  the  program  deals  with  this MPEG code so that the entire movie can be burned onto a single blank DVD.  Unfortunately, this cleverness also opens up this kind of software to an obvious charge: if you buy the software you are obviously going to copy something that has had clever copyright control software built into it to stop you. Under the DMCA Act this bypassing of copyright protection is itself illegal. So 321 lost its action and had to withdraw certain versions of its software and additionally put warnings on the software pages telling its customers not to use the software with copyrighted material. Not that that got 321 Studios very far – the huge cost of the legal action eventually caused it to go bust.   Targeting non-US nationals  The American music and film industry have also started to use American laws to fight individuals living abroad.   Normally what the Americans choose to do in their back garden is strictly their business, but the case of two Brits – Kevin Reid and Ian Hawthorne – shows that we’re not necessarily safe even in the UK.  Reid  and  Hawthorne  ran  a  website  called  bds-palace.co.uk,  which  linked copyrighted material to the global BitTorrent file sharing network. If they didn’t co-operate with a US-based action they were told that they might have to pay $150m in damages. Settle quietly and they would only have to pay $7m!  The demands, from a Washington DC law firm called Jenner & Block, called for Reid  and  Hawthorne  to  hand  over  the  identities  of  the  alleged  copyright infringers  using  their  website.  Needless  to  say  Reid  and  Hawthorne  have  291   The Downloader’s Handbook  refused to pony up the money and settle quietly. And unless they fancy visiting the US any time soon it’s a safe bet that the legal action won’t get anywhere in the UK.   Anyway, Reid and Hawthorne have always said that what they were doing was legal in the UK. They point out that BitTorrent does have its legal uses and bds- palace.co.uk links to legal content hosted by that network. Where they have been  notified  of  links  pointing  to  illegal  content,  they  have  removed  those links, they claim.  The legal bottom Line  Hollywood’s  lawyers  would  have  to  fight  their  legal  actions  in  a  UK  court. They’d have to convince our legal system that the evidence from the US should apply here too, or challenge Reid and Hawthorne under UK copyright law. It’s unlikely  to  happen  but  the  threat  of  legal  action  in  the  US  still  hangs  over another  UK  citizen,  Alexander  Hanff,  who  has  also  been  threatened  by  the music industry body, the MPAA, over his website DVDR-Core.  Question  9:  Is  every  country  quite  so  fierce  in  its  attacks  on  people  who illegally use and distribute copyrighted material?  The tough American and British actions against copyright infringers shouldn’t be  viewed  in  isolation  from  the  global  assault  now  underway.  The  record industry is currently targeting nearly 1,000 people in a new wave of lawsuits against alleged ‘illegal song-swappers’ in actions in 11 countries in Europe and Asia. Following its first year of legal actions in Europe, which resulted in 248 people  paying  fines  or  facing  sanctions,  the  International  Federation  of  the Phonographic  Industries   IFPI   has  said  it’s  bringing  lawsuits  to  four  new European countries, specifically the Netherlands, Finland, Ireland and Iceland. Japan is also getting in on the act as it becomes the first Asian country to take legal action against people who use file sharing services to download copyright material.  These global industry lobbies are carrying out these campaigns because past evidence suggests they work. A huge blitz of actions in Germany a few years back  has  already  resulted  in  illegal  file  sharing  falling  by  one  third.  “The number of music files downloaded there fell to 382m files in 2004, compared to 602m the previous year” says the IFPI.  292   7 – Copyright And The Law  But, in true contrarian, Gallic style, some French judges are starting to openly question  these  aggressive  campaigns.  Here’s  what  one  leading  French magistrate told the technology magazine, Wired.  “We are in the process of creating a cultural rupture between a younger generation that uses the technologies that companies and societies have made available, such as the iPod, file download software, peer-to-peer networks….”   The holder of such unorthodox views  to the music and film industry at least  is a certain Judge Dominique Barella who also happens to be the president of the all important French magistrates union. He’s leading a fight back amongst French magistrates who believe they have much better things to do with their time than threaten iPod users with jail. “It’s like condemning people for driving too fast after selling them cars that go 250kph”, says Barella.  Needless to say the French music and film industry didn’t react warmly to this declaration. In a letter to the French government the industry announced that it was:   “Surprised  and  shocked  that  the  president  of  the  magistrates  union, given  the  level  of  influence  he  has  on  his   judicial   colleagues,  can publish in the press a call to not criminally sanction criminal acts, which contradicts the intentions of government bodies.”   According to Wired, the letter also ominously thanked the minister in advance for “taking actions that he deems appropriate.”  Question 10: Now you’ve got me really worried. I’ve also heard that these file  sharing  networks like  BitTorrent,  Grokster and  Kazaa are  themselves illegal?  A great  many  internet  users  steadfastly  avoid  networks  like Kazaa and BitTorrent because they’ve heard that the networks themselves are illegal, even though  some  of  the  content  on  them  is  actually  not  under  any  copyright protection at all. Are they right? Unfortunately there’s no simple answer to this important question.  The key legal battle is in the US and centres on a high-profile campaign by 28 of  the  world’s  largest  entertainment  companies  against  the  makers  of Morpheus, Grokster and Kazaa.  293   The Downloader’s Handbook  This huge legal battle has been fought all the way to the US Supreme Court, where the music and film industry companies won a notable battle in 2005. By a significant majority the top US Judges ruled that Grokster and its allies were guilty of infringing other people’s copyright and that their software – peer-to- peer software  used  to  run  file  sharing  networks –  should  be  amended  or withdrawn.  It’s worth going over some of the details of this case because it sheds light on a profoundly  important  debate  that’s  been  raging  for  decades  between electronics companies and media outfits in America. The core issue is whether it’s right to sell a piece of equipment or software if it can then be used to copy other  people’s  music  or  film   their  intellectual  property ,  even  though  the original supplier of the equipment software has no knowledge or even control over the final consumer.   The precedent of VHS recorders  Many campaigners maintain that what’s at stake here is the very essence of technological  innovation  itself.  If  an  equipment  supplier  who  makes  a  VHS player, for instance, has to make sure the device won’t ever be able to be used to copy somebody else’s copyright material, won’t that stifle innovation?   Many  years  back  the  US  Supreme  Court  sided  with  this  point  of  view  when faced  with  an  action  by  Universal  against  Sony,  the  makers  of  the  Betamax video machine. Universal argued that these new fangled video machines were clearly designed to copy films broadcast on TV and thus they should have some form of copyright protection built into them. Sony, not unreasonably, argued that they couldn’t police what the buyers of their video machines did with them and that many of the uses of these machines were perfectly legal. What’s more, by forcing them to insert some kind of technology that stopped copying, their innovative  technology  would  be  stopped  dead  in  its  tracks.  Sony  won  this battle   but  lost  the  war  of  video  formats  as  VHS  eventually  dominated  the world  and that victory has, until recently at least, stood the test of time. In essence, new technologies and products are legal and cannot be held liable for consumers  infringement  of  copyright  so  long  as  the  device  or  software  is capable of substantial non-infringing uses.  Over the last few decades the music and film industry has fought long and hard to overturn this decision. The RIAA even took an early pioneer of MP3 players – Diamond Multimedia – to court for devising a technology that was clearly  294   7 – Copyright And The Law  designed to use copyrighted music. Again the RIAA were not successful but had the  decision  gone  against  Diamond  Multimedia and  the  technology  it pioneered, Apple’s hugely successful iPod and the legitimate online download service that it has spawned would surely not exist today.  Needless  to  say  the  music  and  film  industry  see  technical  innovations,  like video recording, MP3 machines and file sharing, in a very different light. They think it’s very clear why consumers are buying these innovative products – to copy other people’s music and film.   MGM vs Grokster  More importantly, the legal advocates for the entertainment industry have long argued that technological suppliers have:   “turned a blind eye to the infringement of their users, and that by turning a blind eye to detectable acts of infringement for the sake of profit gives rise to liability.”   That summary is from a legal argument put to the Supreme Court in the case known as MGM vs Grokster – a key action that has turned the legal tide in favour of the entertainment companies.  Grokster lost this particular case for a number of complex reasons. First there was copious evidence from Grokster and its allies’  notably a network called Streamcast  own internal papers that they were targeting ex-users of the now defunct Napster service. Napster had been originally shut down because it was patently clear that the service was promoting its business to users who wanted to get illegal content. One marketing campaign proudly implored users to join Napster and ‘Get Hundreds of hours of music for next to nothing’! The courts held  that  Napster should  clearly  be  liable  for  its  users’  infringement  of copyright,  and  thus,  if  Grokster and  its  allies  were  trying  to  poach  these customers, they too would be liable.   Also, neither Grokster nor Streamcast have tried to develop any filters or clever little  tools  to  control  the  copyright  infringement  that  was  clearly  going  on using their software. At one point it was estimated that 90% of all content on Grokster was  illegal.  If  they’d  at  least  tried  to  advertise  some  filter  that purported to stop all these illegal music and film files, then they could at least claim they’d attempted to do something; but in reality they hadn’t bothered, so they were guilty!  295   The Downloader’s Handbook  The last nail in the coffin was perhaps the most obvious. It was always pretty clear to all and sundry how Grokster and Streamcast made their money – from advertising – and more specifically from advertising that was paid for on the basis of the number of eyeballs looking at the website. But what drives more and more people to use the networks and thus look at the advertising? Illegal content  of  course!  People  use  networks  like  Grokster because  there’s  an enormous quantity of useful, illegal stuff on them, and in reality, the Supreme Court argued, the management of both Grokster and Streamcast knew that too and that’s what determined the rates they charged to their advertisers.  What  this  landmark  ruling  in  effect  created  was  a  new  theory  of  copyright liability that measures whether manufacturers create their products, services or software with the ‘intent of inducing consumers to infringe’. It’s also important to  underline  what  this  judgment  didn’t  say.  It  didn’t  say  that  file  sharing networks, per se, were illegal. It merely concluded that the owners of Grokster and Streamcast knew they were being used to distribute illegal content and did nothing to stop it.  The  name  of  the  game  now  –  post-ruling  –  is  this:  if  a  file  sharing  service clearly declares that copyright material should not be used on the network and that this kind of content is illegal and then devises some  fairly pointless  filters that allow you to bypass the illegal content, that service can be legal.   In  fact,  the  Supreme  Court  specifically  stated  that  they  did  not  regard  their judgment  as  a  barrier  to  people  devising  technologies  that  might  involve copyright  infringement  –  their  only  concern  is  that  the  innovators  don’t knowingly market a service or product aimed at copyright infringement.  The approach in Australia  Courts in other key countries have taken a very different, more stringent view.   In Australia, for instance, home of the Kazaa file sharing network, a Federal Court judge has clearly sided with the entertainment industry and ruled that all file sharing networks are in effect illegal, unleashing legal claims that could total at least $760 million.  In Justice Murray R. Wilcox’s ruling, the file sharing networks, and Kazaa in particular, were  found  guilty  of  enticing  Australians  to  make and  distribute unauthorised sound recordings without license, as well as collectively “entering  296   7 – Copyright And The Law  into a common design” that enabled unauthorised trafficking. Kazaa either had to shut down or design a search system that excluded copyrighted works, and broadcast messages to current users compelling them to upgrade to this rights- managed version.   But the judgment also clearly pointed that “the internet is here to stay”, that P2P is a force unto itself, and that rather than fighting the natural course of evolution, the recording industry should adopt stronger safeguards and digital rights management procedures to protect themselves. If CDs couldn’t be ripped the court action wouldn’t have happened!  Conclusion  So, returning to our original question of whether these networks are, by design, illegal,  the  answer  is:  probably  maybe!  If  the  file  sharing  network  was specifically designed to share illegal content and the developers and owners of the network knew that, the answer is, in the US and Australia at least, yes, it’s illegal.  But file sharing networks and their technologies are not, in pure legal terms, illegal and if the operators of these networks issue loud warnings about illegal content and try to devise content filters, then that network would be legal.   And  lastly,  there’s  the  small  matter  of  UK  jurisdiction.  To  date,  no-one  has actually fought in the British courts to close down file sharing sites and thus there is no major UK court case that suggests file sharing is illegal.  Question 11: Am I going to face legal action if I am only an occasional downloader, accessing just a few music tracks and the odd film?  Let’s pause for one moment and reflect on a smart article by the journalist Tony Smith  of  the  Register,  an  online  technology  newspaper.  Smith  has  actually bothered to do his homework on the law behind the internet and file sharing and his analysis of the legal campaign against the big serial uploaders has some interesting implications for the occasional downloader. His key point is that the big legal actions against users who upload thousands of tracks is doomed to fail. As Smith says:  297   The Downloader’s Handbook  “There are going to be limits to the effectiveness of this route. The actions will make an impression on the general public, but the message that gets across is more likely to be that it’s really not smart to be sharing large numbers of files, rather than ‘It Is Stealing and It Is WRONG’. So they share less files, and as the memory of the publicity subsides, they slowly share more files. So they have to be reminded. And reminded again, and again. If the music industry only goes for the big sharers, then it really can’t hope to do much more than damp it down, and the more it does it, the  more  obvious  it  will  become  that  modest  levels  of  sharing  are, apparently, safe. Which means that if they don’t do something broader, it’s even arguable that they’ll be making most people more confident that they’re  safe  from  lawsuits.  This  presents  a  nasty  choice  to  the  BPI  – widen the actions, or view the current campaign as a limited, short-term measure and think of something more sustainable.”  I’ve  quoted  this  article  at  length  because  it  raises  an  important  point.  To paraphrase Smith, the legal action against uploaders is only ever going to be a campaign  against  a  small  number  of  people.  If  they  do  decide  to  target  the hundreds of thousands of occasional downloaders in the UK, they’ll be fighting in  the  courts  for  decades.  In  essence,  it’s  all  a  ‘scare’  campaign  that  will probably end up stopping very little.   Question 13: What happens if it’s my children doing the illegal file sharing but I receive a letter threatening legal action?  The  BPI  says  it  can’t  differentiate  between  children  and  adults  in  its  legal actions because it does not actually know their identities. Typically the BPI will track  the  big  file  sharing  networks and  try  to  spot  prolific  distributors  of copyrighted content. They’ll quickly be able to track most users back to their internet service provider – the ISP then receives a request from the BPI’s legal team  demanding  personal  information.  Some  ISPs  have  resisted  these  orders and in other countries, such as Holland, ISPs have fought their way through the courts to fight the music and film industry legal actions. But in the UK most ISPs will willingly oblige. Your details – not your childrens – get handed over to the BPI’s lawyers and within a few weeks a letter arrives in the post. And as the adult in the house, who’s signed up with the internet service provider, you are  responsible  and  you  will  probably  have  to  pay  the  legal  costs  as  many parents in the UK have already discovered!  298   7 – Copyright And The Law  Question 14: Has anyone asked the musicians what they think about these file sharing networks and the threat of legal actions?  The music industry loves to make out that it leads a united front in the battle against the despicable music pirates. The clearly stated assumption is that the industry is fighting these legal actions globally to defend the poor musician. And certainly whenever this issue makes it into the media in the US a friendly music  act  like  Metallica  are  wheeled  out  to  complain  about  their  livelihood being threatened. But what do the vast bulk of professional musicians actually think about all this digital music and file sharing?  Luckily the US-based The Pew Internet & American Life Project has conducted a survey among musicians. Here’s what they  surprisingly  said:     66%  of  musicians  surveyed  said  that  the  internet  is  ‘very  important’  in helping them to create and distribute their music. Additionally, 90% of all respondents use the internet to seek out inspiration.    A  massive  66%  of  musicians’  view  file  sharing  as  a  minor  threat  or  no  threat at all.    Musicians don’t particularly like file sharing networks that distribute their music online without any payment for copyright. Two-thirds of all artists surveyed said that the people who run the file sharing services should be held responsible for the piracy, while 37% of musicians believe that both those  running  the  file-sharing  programs  and  the  individuals  sharing  the files should be held jointly accountable. 60% of all musicians surveyed said the US music industry’s legal actions will not benefit them in any way. Selling  material  without  the  creator’s  permission  is  broadly  regarded  as wrong, while copying material for private use is seen as acceptable.        It’s  also  worth  making  one  last  point,  namely  that  a  growing  number  of musicians do use networks like BitTorrent and Kazaa to distribute their music to a new audience – look at the recent success in the UK of the Arctic Monkeys. If you’re an unknown act, file sharing networks can be a great way of building a fan base who can then be encouraged to buy the album via download from the band’s own website. The Metallica’s of the world may have the enormous advantage of a high-profile music label to publicise them, but an increasing number of musicians think file sharing networks are their best allies.  299   The Downloader’s Handbook  How can a serial uploader avoid attention?  1. My best advice is to get off the traditional file sharing networks based on the FastTrack system  Kazaa Grokster  and head off to BitTorrent – the big American anti-piracy groups like the RIAA are concentrating most of their efforts against FastTrack. If you can avoid this network, the chances of getting caught are diminished substantially.  2. Make sure no-one can see your shared directory. If John Doe can look in your  shared  directory  then  you  can  bet  your  life  the  anti-piracy watchdogs will be looking as well, especially if you’ve got loads of films and music in there. It’s against the spirit of file sharing, but get real…  3. Share fewer files. If you’re a P2P true believer, the idea of cutting down on what you share is probably blasphemous, but as with hiding your shared  directory,  it  makes  sense.  Have  thousands  of  music  tracks  in your  directory  rather  draws  attention  to  you.  According  to  the  file sharing news community Slyke, the majority of RIAA targets have 800 or more shared files. If you feel you do want to share your music and want to avoid trouble, keep the number of files below 50.  4. A lot of smart file sharers are heading off to the communal networks based on the IRC channels or sharing within tightly controlled trusted networks  based  on  friends.  If  you  share  with  who  you  know  you’ll probably be safe most of the time.  5. Remove all potentially misleading file names that might be connected  with the name of a leading US-based artist.  6. According to one organisation, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the RIAA also appears to be targeting its legal actions at users who allow their computers to be supernodes on the FastTrack P2P System  used, for  instance,  by  Kazaa and  Morpheus .  They  say  to  reduce  this  you should make sure your computer is not being used as a supernode.   7. Some file sharers are using a bit of software called PeerGuardian. This blocks bad IP addresses from your computer – these IP addresses belong to the anti-piracy investigators. It does this by using a publicly available databank  of  IP  addresses  from  an  outfit  called  Blocklist.org.  This  is  a clever idea  and one I use , although I presume the big boys – the RIAA and MPAA – know their IP addresses are in public circulation and simply switch server and address or use a technology called dynamic IP address.  300   7 – Copyright And The Law  Sounds like the case for copying and downloading is legally and morally hopeless? There is in fact a strong moral case for fair use of copyright material you’ve purchased. The law in the UK may not accept that, but other legal jurisdictions do recognise that some uses of copyright material are acceptable. The problem is that the additional moral case for then sharing that content is dubious to say the least.  The moral case for fair use  With most things we buy, we acquire the right to use them in any way we want within certain limits. If we buy a car we buy it because we want to do anything we want with it, with the exception of maybe using it to kill someone with it at great speed. So we accept that property rights infer on us exclusive control within certain limits designed to protect the public.  When you buy media content – films or music – you only buy a license to that property  for  your  own  private  use,  not  to  distribute  around  the  internet.  In effect,  you’re  not  buying  the  music,  per  se,  but  your  copy  of  it.  The entertainment  industry  maintains  that  if  you  copy  this  material  in  any  way, that infringes the ultimate owner’s rights.  But let’s go back to that example of the car. We accept that any limits placed on us in the use of our newly acquired thing  a car  are to safeguard other users from  significant  injury. But  the  limits  placed  on  us  by  the  music  and  film industry are not to protect against injury or harm – in reality the restrictions placed on our use is simply to defend the intellectual property of the owner.   In and of itself that’s no bad thing. If I paint a great work of art after decades of hard graft, the odd bout of insanity and copious quantities of drugs, I should have  the  right  to  benefit  from  my  newly  painted  property. I’d  be  especially annoyed if some faker came along, exactly copied my work of art and then sold eight thousand of them over the internet. Defence of property rights, especially against people who wish to copy my work and then distribute it widely and freely, is perfectly reasonable and fair.  But what happens if I buy that work of art, as a rich collector, and then choose to make a facsimile copy of the work, which is in turn stored in a safe place in case  my  house  is  burnt  down.  Surely  this  form  of  copying,  to  protect  my  301   The Downloader’s Handbook  investment in this work of art is reasonable and fair  if probably a bit sad . I’m not attempting to profit from the artist just to protect my investment.   In a sense the copying of a CD or DVD for personal back-up use is the exact equivalent. I have paid money for my own copy of a work of art, and this CD and DVD is valuable to me and I want to back-up my investment, especially as CD and DVDs are hardly indestructible. One small scratch on a DVD could wipe out a £20 purchase!  What is so wrong with backing up that investment and then using it for my own purposes? Many music industry license agreements already tacitly accept this argument by granting legitimate users the right to store the digital content supplied by the network on whatever storage media they want – to, in effect, safeguard their property  Wippit, eMusic, et al . Equally, the software industry also accepts that users may want to make back-up copies of essential software. What’s so different about backing up a hard copy, physical CD or DVD with film or music on it that you’ve also paid for?  And let’s be realistic here, the entertainment industry already tacitly accepts this fair use point. They may proclaim that any copying is illegal, but to date no-one has been prosecuted in the UK for making personal back-ups, solely for private use. The industry recognises that millions of us do it, and it’s not worth them stopping us from doing what many of us regard as fair.  Isn’t file sharing a way of making content accessible to millions cheaply? Backing up content for personal use has a strong moral argument in its favour, but the act of then sharing that property over a public network is a much more difficult moral argument. There’s no getting away from the fact that you are effectively sharing someone else’s intellectual property.  Some file sharing activists say that as long as no money passes between the participants in a network, what’s the problem? Even they’d accept that buying pirate DVDs on a street corner is a clear example of someone stealing property from  someone  else,  but  file  sharing  networks don’t  use  money,  just  co- operation  and  trust.  But  the  bottom  line  is  that  someone  else’s  intellectual property, on which they financially rely on, is still being taken away and not  302   7 – Copyright And The Law  paid for. Whether you call this theft or copyright breach is a moot point, but it’s still probably not right.  Many  file  sharers  fall  back  on  another  argument:  that  file  sharing  is  fair because film and music content is just too expensive. They have a point. The high  street  price  of  CDs  and  DVDs  is  nothing  short  of  legalised  larceny, especially in the UK. Visit the US and the net high street price is just under half of what we in the UK are charged. And music prices seem to have been going up steadily for years – high street prices for top albums have recently started climbing  above  £15  an  album,  well  up  on  the  price  of  vinyl  which  is presumably  a  more  expensive  medium.  Equally,  the  price  of  movie  seats, especially in the big cities, has been steadily rising for the last decade, and in London it now regularly tops £10. It’s difficult to argue with those critics who maintain  that  we,  the  consumer,  are  being  fleeced  by  the  entertainment industry.  All of this criticism sounds immensely reasonable, up until the point at which you upload some copyright content on a network and then make it available to all and sundry for free. If you don’t like the prices being charged for CDs and DVDs, find somewhere cheaper to buy the product! Go online and buy the CD or DVD from a Jersey-based operator that doesn’t pay VAT! Don’t like cinema prices, why not wait until you can rent it on a DVD, and then watch it on your own home cinema system? The big movie studios and record companies are probably ripping us off, but that doesn’t justify ripping them off. Two wrongs don’t make a right. All you have to do, as an active consumer, is fight back and find  the  cheapest  way  of  legitimately  purchasing  the  CD  or  DVD,  not  copy someone else’s copy.  303   The Downloader’s Handbook  File sharing – a force for the good Whatever you may think of the moral basis of file sharing, it has at the very least produced a series of tangible public goods.            File sharing has sparked a series of technological innovations, such as the Skype  voice  telephone  calls  over  the  internet  service  and,  indirectly,  the legal  music  download  services  that  have  created  billions  in  sales  and created thousands of jobs. File sharing networks have also forced the music industry to invest even more money into innovation and developing new acts and new ways of getting performers in front of music fans. More and more music companies make more and more of their profits from carefully managed series of live acts and performances. File sharing has also forced the music industry to accept that not everyone wants to shell out an awful lot of money on an album with just a few good tracks. Music consumers are becoming much choosier about their purchases and are increasingly unwilling to accept album filler material.  304   Conclusion    Conclusion  The not too distant future – what to watch out for File  sharing  is  a  wonderful  driver  for  change.  It’s  forcing  those  lazy  media giants to open up their vaults and start releasing content on increasingly fair terms. As I pointed out in our last chapter on the legal position, file sharing is a powerful  force  for  the  good,  encouraging  wonderful  new  innovations  that should make your entertainment life that bit richer.  But this wonderful change is also going to throw up some new challenges for you. Here’s my list of 10 things to watch out for in the near future.  1. Avoid the soon to be launched legal online film download services  As I write, Universal is rumoured to be about to start offering a service whereby you buy a DVD, and get the right to download one copy of it to your hard drive. In theory this is a great innovation. But it’s also almost certainly a waste of the extra  money  you’ll  probably  have  to  pay  for  the  privilege,  because  that downloaded  film  file  will  have  fierce  DRM protection  built  into  it,  which restricts your ability to make a back-up or watch the data file on your home TV. The bigger point here is that movie downloads will be expensive, fenced in with  astonishingly  restrictive  DRM and  probably  won’t  have  the  really interesting films you’re after. Personally, I’d sit out this market for the next few years and wait until a real innovator with power, like Apple or Amazon, wades in.  2. Broadband speeds – here comes 24 Mbps!  The whole broadband ISP space is one of the fastest growing markets on planet earth and there are new entrants – and new technologies – emerging almost every week. Price is what is fundamentally powering this competition, but new technologies will only serve to intensify this battle and the next big one will be over upgrades to your broadband speed. 8Mbps is next on the agenda in the UK, followed by super ADSL technology that will kick speeds up to 24Mbps. Cable companies might even start experimenting with 100Mbps speeds. It all sounds wonderful, until you ask yourself why you need all this extra speed and capacity? In my opinion, 2Mbps for most heavy downloaders is probably more than adequate for the time being. Obviously jump on board the 8Mbps express when prices crash down to between £15 and £20 per month, but until then sit it out.  307   The Downloader’s Handbook  3. Watch the wireless broadband space carefully  The  big  mobile  networks  are  currently  rolling  out  data  cards  that  fit  into laptops that can run at broadband speeds for about £30 a month. But there’s a catch – your usage is capped at around 250MB a month, which makes it useless for  any  kind  of  file  sharing  on  the  move  except  maybe  for  music.  But  the technology is evolving fast and I’d expect prices to fall sharply and smarter phones to emerge that can also surf these 3G networks. And then there’s also WiMax. It’s a little over-hyped at the moment, but it could potentially disrupt everything. It’s essentially a Wi-Fi network that extends over many miles. This kind of broadband public access infrastructure could open up wonderful new possibilities, especially as big cities start to compete with each other to offer the best range of hotspots.  4. Good old-fashioned ethernet technology still works!  In the great rush to embrace the wireless age many PC users forget that cabling via  Ethernet  works  brilliantly.  As  a  technology  it  boasts  a  number  of attractions,  notably  it’s  secure  from  wireless  hackers  and  it’s  reliable  over longer  distances  with  big  multimedia files.  If  you  plan  to  share  media  rich content around your house, in different rooms, with different devices and PCs, think long and hard about an ethernet network. It will work particularly well with transferring big data files, and it’s cheap and relatively easy to configure.  5. The next big thing – voice over the internet  Broadband and  file  sharing  technologies  have  given  new  telephony technologies  a  huge  push  and  the  next  big  thing  is  called  ‘voice  over  the internet’ or VoIP. One of the leading operators in this space is Skype, which uses a kind of file sharing technology to enable its users to make ultra-cheap or free calls  anywhere  around  the  world.  VoIP  has  emerged  as  a  mass  market phenomena and the technology works. It’s also ultra cheap; and if you sign up with operators like Vonage you can use the service even when your computer is not switched on.   6. P2P activity will not diminish  Renegade  file  sharing  technologies  will  keep  coming  under  sustained  attack over  the  next  few  years  and  the  big  entertainment  companies  will  try  to  308   Conclusion  convince you that P2P is on the decline – don’t believe them. It’s a propaganda war now and the anti-piracy police have a vested interest in predicting ‘the end’ – the demise of file sharing – but the file sharing technologies will carry on growing and keep finding ways of shaking off ‘the enemy’. The immediate front line  in  this  battle  though  will  be  the  big  indexing  sites  for  the  BitTorent network – TorrentSpy is already under full attack and I’d expect an assault any day now on the excellent IsoHunt.com.  7. Another next big Thing could be legal file sharing  This allows you and your mates to share files easily and safely on ‘closed user’ file sharing networks. This technology has been around for a long time, and many users of BitTorrent already use this technology, but there are a raft of new providers emerging in this space with some great products. In my experience a lot of the proprietary networks are tricky to use and the best of the bunch at the moment is something called FolderShare which you can use for free.  8. To HD or not to HD?  High definition is coming fast and already many of the main file sharing sites boast  dozens  of  files  with  the  letters  HD  somewhere  in  the  melange  of acronyms.  Although  downloading  HD  files  specifically  is  a  bit  of  pointless exercise. Usually most of the files have been compressed to buggery and thus all  the  great  virtues  of  HD  –  better  line  resolution  and  crystal  clear  picture quality  –  vanish  almost  instantly. Nevertheless,  if  you  see  two  files  that  are exactly the same except that one is HD, obviously download the HD file – the picture quality will be better.  9. Portable disk drives versus streaming devices versus media centres?  In this book we’ve already mentioned the growing assault on the lounge by PC technology. The next great battle is going to be over the device that makes it into  your  lounge  –  will  it  be  a  very  easy  to  use  portable  hard  drive  that connects straight to your TV, a clever black box that streams content to the TV or  will  it  be  Bill  Gates’  great  vision  of  a  consumer  electronics  new  world  – media center PCs?   It’s  very  early  days  in  this  enormous  battle  of  the  future,  but  I’d  hazard  a number of important guesses. First off, media center PCs that really work as  309   The Downloader’s Handbook  promised are probably still too expensive. You need devices that really do work easily without any real meaningful internal fan sound, and at the moment that means spending £800 or more. Many of you might be tempted to go down the DIY  route  and  build  your  own  smart  entertainment  PC  that  uses  Windows Media Center as an operating system, but beware – it’s a very choosy operating system that doesn’t work well with many off the shelf components that go into a PC.   Streaming devices are already battling it out in the music space and most of them work very well, but Pinnacle has recently upped the ante by releasing a media device that sits under the TV and plays video off your PC. It’s a great idea and my system works brilliantly, but I’d be lying if I didn’t admit that most firewalls  struggle  to  cope  with  it  and  the  networking  technology  that  lurks behind it is a bit fiddly. Many consumers, by contrast, are tempted by the cheap hard disk based ‘brick’ devices where you transfer movies and music off your PC and then re-connect to the TV using a Scart connector – we mentioned them in  our  section  on  video  and  featured  the  LaCie player.  The  technology absolutely works and is very easy to use – and what’s better it’s increasingly cheap  and  good  quality  devices  shouldn’t  cost  you  more  than  £150  at  most nowadays.   My verdict? Don’t even look at Media Center PCs until costs have come below £500 and the OS has been simplified, while streaming devices are fine if you are technically savvy but should otherwise be avoided. Hard drive players are the simplest and best technology on the market at the moment  Rhapsody do a particularly good one , and new devices that also incorporate wireless links and even a streaming capability are also on their way.  10. Look out for iMP from the BBC  The  venerable  British  Broadcasting  Corporation  deserves  all  the  plaudits  its received  over  the  last  decade  for  its  technological  breakthroughs.  Its  news websites really are fantastic – especially now they’ve built in RSS support – and its  trials  in  the  podcasting  space  are  superb,  with  its  weekly  In  Our  Time download  a philosophy, science and history discussion series  taking top prize for fabulous, compelling content available for free with ease. The next big thing will be its online video player called iMP  Interactive Media Player . This will allow online viewers to watch most of the BBC’s output for around seven days  310   Conclusion  after its broadcast, probably for free in the UK at least. It should be due out sometime in 2006.  Users  of  a  similar  video  on  demand  service,  pioneered  by  the  company HomeChoice, have already test trialled this fantastic service. And while on the subject of HomeChoice, if you are in the right area to get this service, subscribe now! This is the future now, and allows users to access nearly all the key cable channels via their internet connection and also lets viewers watch films and certain popular TV programmes on demand, whenever they want to.   BT are rumoured to be about to bring out a challenger to this service but video on demand using the internet is a thing of wonder and completely changes the relationship of the viewer to TV. As with other download technologies it allows you to watch what you want to watch, when you want to watch it. The only big downsides in my personal experience are that the picture quality isn’t fab, and  you  can’t  actually  record  the  programmes  and  store  them  on  your  hard drive  for  later  use.  Still,  the  world’s  not  a  perfect  place  and  as  it  only  costs around £25 a month with ordinary 2Mbps broadband thrown in plus free calls, beggars can’t be choosers. Video on demand using broadband has arrived and it’ll completely change the way we use TV…  311    Index    AA ActiveX, 55, 61-63, 82, 139 Analogue, xvii, 23-24, 85, 134 Anti-piracy, 244, 247, 252,
