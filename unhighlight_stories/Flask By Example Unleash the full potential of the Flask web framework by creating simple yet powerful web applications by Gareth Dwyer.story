He hasn't found one yet. Gareth grew up with his three siblings in Grahamstown,  South Africa. There wasn't much there except some highly respected schools and  a small university. Gareth had heard that school was an unpleasant and largely  pointless experience, so he opted to skip it and go to the university instead. The  university door had a no-entry sign on the door because it only accepted people who  had gone to school. Gareth ignored the sign. He studied piano for a while but soon,  he wondered if there was more to life than sitting in front of a keyboard all day. So  he switched from piano to computer science, and it took him a while to realize the  irony. He studied philosophy too because it was here that people never told him to  stop being so argumentative.  Gareth noticed the disparagement that his philosophy and computer science  departments felt towards each other, and he found it strange. He soon discovered  that he wasn't the first person to see that there was room for some common ground,  and he went to Europe to study computational linguistics, where he found other  people who liked debating the finer points of language while talking about the three  hardest problems of computer science  naming things, and off-by-one errors .  In between doodling on blank paper while listening to very knowledgeable people  lecture on content that was occasionally fascinating but often soporific, Gareth  has gained so-called "industry" experience with companies such as Amazon Web  Services in Cape Town and MWR InfoSecurity in Johannesburg. He has several  years' experience in writing, and his favorite languages are English and Python. He discovered that writing and writing a book are not fully overlapping experiences,  and the former is hardly preparation for the latter. The pages that follow would not  have come into existence without the combined efforts of many people.  www.it-ebooks.info   Acknowledgements  Thank you Neeshma and Kajal; you have been so very kind and patient in spite of my  disrespect for deadlines.

In practice, everything works but no one  knows why. Here, we combine theory and practice; nothing works and no one knows why!  Learning computer science must always be a combination of theory and practice;  you need to know what you're doing  theory , but you also need to know how to  do it  practice . My experience of learning how to create web applications was that  few teachers found a sweet spot for this balance; either I read pages and pages about  inheritance, virtual environments, and test-driven development, wondering how it  all applied to me, or I installed a bunch of tools and frameworks and libraries and  watched the magic happen with no idea how it worked.  What follows is, I hope, a good balance. From the first chapter, you'll have a Flask  web application running that the whole world can visit, which is quite practical even  if it doesn't do anything but greet visitors with "Hello, World!". In the chapters that  follow, we'll walk through building three interesting and useful projects together.  In general, we'll build things ourselves wherever possible. While it's not good to  reinvent the wheel, it is good to be exposed to a problem before you're exposed to  the solution. Learning a CSS framework before you write a single line of CSS leaves  you in a confused state, in which you would wonder, "But why do I actually need  this?", and the same goes for many other frameworks and tools. So, we'll start from  scratch, take a look at why it's difficult, and then introduce tools to make our lives  easier. I think this is the ideal balance between theory and practice.  When I told people I was writing a book on Flask, the common response was "Why?  There are already so many books and tutorials on Flask." This is a valid question, and  the answer to it provides a nice outline for what to expect from this book. Flask By  Example is different from other Flask educational material and here's why.  [ ix ]  www.it-ebooks.info   We won't leave you stranded Many Flask tutorials show you how to develop a Flask application and run it locally  on your own machine, and then they end. This is great as a first step, but if you're  interested in building web applications, you probably want them to be accessible  on the Web so that your friends, family, coworkers, and customers can admire your  handiwork without popping by your house. From our first project onward, our  applications will run on a Virtual Private Server  VPS  and be accessible to the world.  We won't build a blogging application If you've read any web application development tutorials, you must have noticed  that nearly every one of them is about how to build a blog using x and y. I'm pretty  tired of the blog example  actually, I never want to see anyone show me how to build  a blog again . Instead, you'll create some interesting, original, and possibly even  useful projects while learning how to develop web applications with Flask.  We will focus on security Cybercrime has become something of a buzzword of late. Arguably, the reason  that we read about major web applications being hacked on an almost daily basis  is because so many developers do not know about SQL Injection, CSRF, XSS, how  to store passwords, and so many other things that should really be considered  basic knowledge. As we develop the three projects in this book, we'll take the time  to explain some core security concepts in detail and show you how to harden our  applications against potentially malicious attackers.  We will give in-depth explanations We won't just give you some code and tell you to run it. Wherever possible, we will  explain what we're doing, why we're doing it, and how we're doing it. This means that  you'll be able to take ideas from all of the projects, combine them with your own ideas,  and get started with building original content right after working through this book.  Therefore, I hope that this book will be of use to you, no matter whether you are  beginning to cut your teeth in the world of computer science and programming or  have a computer science degree from a famous university and have compiler theory  pouring out of your ears but now want to build something practical and fun. May you  have as much fun working through the projects as I did while putting them together!  [ x ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Preface   What this book covers Chapter 1, Hello, World!, teaches you to set up our development environment and a  web server and write our first Flask application. Chapter 2, Getting Started with Our Headlines Project, shows you how to run Python  code when the user visits a URL and how to return basic data to the user. We will  also look at fetching the latest headlines automatically using RSS feeds. Chapter 3, Using Templates in Our Headlines Project, introduces Jinja templates and  integrates them into our Headlines project. We will show how to serve dynamic  HTML content by passing data from our Python code to template files. Chapter 4, User Input for Our Headlines Project, shows how to get input from our users  over the Internet and use this input to customize what we will show our users. We  will look at how to access currenct weather information through JSON APIs and  include this information in our Headlines project. Chapter 5, Improving the User Experience of Our Headlines Project, instructs you to add  cookies to our Headlines project so that our application can remember our users'  choices. We will also style our application by adding some basic CSS. Chapter 6, Building an Interactive Crime Map, introduces our new project, which is   a crime map. We will introduce relational databases, install MySQL on our server,  and look at how to interact with our database from our Flask application. Chapter 7, Adding Google Maps to our Crime Map Project, instructs you on adding a  Google Maps widget and shows how to add and remove markers from the map  based on our database. We will add an HTML form with various inputs for users   to submit new crimes and also display the existing crimes. Chapter 8, Validating User Input in Our Crime Map Project, polishes off our second  project by making sure that users can't break it accidentally or through maliciously  crafted input. Chapter 9, Building a Waiter Caller App, introduces our final project, which is an  application to call a waiter to the table at a restaurant. We will introduce Bootstrap  and set up a basic User Account Control system that uses Bootstrap as the frontend. Chapter 10, Template Inheritance and WTForms in Waiter Caller Project, introduces   Jinja's template inheritance features so that we can add similar pages without  duplicating code. We will use the WTForms library to make our web forms easier   to build and validate.  [ xi ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Preface   Chapter 11, Using MongoDB with Our Waiter Caller Project, discusses how to install   and configure MongoDB on our server and links it to our Waiter Caller project.   We will finish off our final project by adding indices to our database and a favicon   to our application. Appendix, A Sneak Peek into the Future, outlines some important topics and technologies  that we weren't able to cover in detail and gives pointers on where more can be learned  about these.  What you need for this book All the examples we will use assume that you use the Ubuntu operating system  on your development machine and that you have access to a server that runs  Ubuntu Server  we will discuss how to set the latter up in the first chapter . If you  strongly prefer another operating system and already have a Python environment  set up  including the Python package manger pip , then the examples will be easily  translatable.  All other software and libraries used in the book are freely available, and we will  demonstrate how to install and configure them in detail as the need arises.  Who this book is for Have you looked at PHP and hated the clunky bloated syntax? Or, have you looked  at .Net and wished that it was more open and flexible? Have you tried your hand at  GUI libraries in Python and found them hard to use? If your answer to any one of  these questions is yes, then this is just the book for you.  It is also intended for people who know the basics of Python and want to learn how  to use it to build powerful solutions with a web frontend.  Conventions In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different  kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of  their meaning.  Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions,  pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows:  "We can include other contexts through the use of the include directive."  [ xii ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Preface   A block of code is set as follows:  @app.route " "  def get_news  : return "no news is good news"  When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the  relevant lines or items are set in bold:  import feedparserfrom flask import Flask app = Flask __name__ BBC_FEED = "http:  feeds.bbci.co.uk news rss.xml"  Any command-line input or output is written as follows:  sudo apt-get update  sudo apt-get install git  New terms and important words are shown in bold. Words that you see on   the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this:  "Clicking the Next button moves you to the next screen."  Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.  Tips and tricks appear like this.  Reader feedback Feedback from our readers is always welcome.

[ xv ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Preface   www.it-ebooks.info   Hello, World!  And hello, reader! Let's get started with building some Flask applications. Flask is  minimalist enough to allow you choice and flexibility; unlike in larger frameworks,  you choose what you want to do and then manipulate Flask to do your bidding, and  it is complete enough to work right out of the box.  We'll walk together through the development of three web applications; the first  one is straightforward and will allow you to cut your teeth on Flask and get used to  the new technologies and terminology while building a nontrivial web application;  the second will get you started with building a web application that makes use of a  traditional SQL database; and the final, which has the most features, will make use  of a NoSQL database and a frontend framework to create a useful and good-looking  web application.  In this chapter, we'll take a brief look at what Flask is and, perhaps more importantly,  what it isn't. We'll move on to setting up our basic development environment as well  as a web server, and we'll install a Python package manager as well as Flask itself. By  the end of the chapter, we'll have the outlines of our first app, and, as dictated by age- old tradition, we'll use our new skills to display the text "Hello, World!".  In brief, we will cover the following topics:  Introducing Flask        Creating our development environment    Writing "Hello, World!"    Deploying our application to production  [ 1 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Introducing Flask Flask is a micro framework for Python web development. A framework, in the  simplest terms, is a library or collection of libraries that aims to solve a part of a generic  problem instead of a complete specific one. When building web applications, there  are some problems that will always need to be solved, such as routing from URLs to  resources, inserting dynamic data into HTML, and interacting with an end user.  Flask is a micro framework because it implements only core functionality  including  routing  but leaves more advanced functionality  including authentication and  database ORMs  to extensions. The result of this is less initial setup for the first-time  user and more choice and flexibility for the experienced user. This is in contrast  with "fuller" frameworks, such as Django, which dictate their own ORM and  authentication technologies.  As we'll discuss, our Hello World application in Flask can be written in only seven  lines of code, with the entire application consisting of a single file. Does that sound  good? Let's get going!  Creating our development environment A development environment consists of all the software that a developer uses while  building software. For starters, we'll install a Python package manager  pip  and the  Flask package. In this book, we'll show detailed steps for developing using Python  2.7 on a clean installation of Ubuntu 14.04, but everything should be easy to translate  to Windows or OS X.  Installing pip For our Hello World application, we only need the Python Flask package, but we'll  install several Python packages throughout the development process of our three  applications. To manage these packages, we'll use the Python package manager pip.  If you've developed in Python without a package manager until now, you'll love  how easy it is to download, install, remove, and update packages using pip. If you  already use it, then skip to the next step where we'll use it to install Flask.  The pip manager is included in Python's 3.4+ and 2.7.9+ versions. For older versions  of Python, pip needs to be installed. To install pip on Ubuntu, open a terminal and  run the following command:  sudo apt-get update  sudo apt-get install python-pip  [ 2 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Hello, World!   To install pip on Windows or OS X, you can download and run the  get-pip.py file from the pip homepage at https:  pip.pypa. io en latest installing install-or-upgrade-pip.  That's it! You can now easily install any Python package you need through pip.  Installing Flask Installing Flask through pip could not be more straightforward. Simply run   the following:  pip install –-user flask  You might see some warnings in your terminal, but at the end, you should also see  Successfully installed Flask. Now, you can import Flask into a Python program just  as with any other library.  If you're used to using VirtualEnv for Python development, you can  install Flask inside a VirtualEnv environment. We will discuss this  further in Appendix, A Sneak Peek into the Future.  Writing "Hello, World!" Now, we'll create a basic web page and serve it using Flask's built-in server to  localhost. This means that we'll run a web server on our local machine that we can  easily make requests to from our local machine. This is very useful for development  but not suited for production applications. Later on, we'll take a look at how to serve  Flask web applications using the popular Apache web server.  Writing the code Our application will be a single Python file. Create a directory in your home directory  called firstapp and a file inside this called hello.py. In the hello.py file, we'll write  code to serve a web page comprising the static string "Hello, World!". The code looks  as follows:  from flask import Flask  app = Flask __name__   [ 3 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 1   @app.route " "  def index  :     return "Hello, World!"  if __name__ == '__main__':     app.run port=5000, debug=True   Downloading the example code You can download the example code files for this book from your  account at http:  www.packtpub.com. If you purchased this  book elsewhere, you can visit http:  www.packtpub.com  support and register to have the files e-mailed directly to you. You can download the code files by following these steps:     Log in or register to our website using your e-mail address   and password.     Hover the mouse pointer on the SUPPORT tab at the top.    Click on Code Downloads & Errata.    Enter the name of the book in the Search box.    Select the book for which you're looking to download the   code files.     Choose from the drop-down menu where you purchased   this book from.     Click on Code Download.  Once the file is downloaded, please make sure that you unzip or  extract the folder using the latest version of:     WinRAR   7-Zip for Windows    Zipeg   iZip   UnRarX for Mac     7-Zip   PeaZip for Linux  Let's break down what this does. The first line should be familiar; it simply imports  Flask from the package flask. The second line creates an instance of the Flask object  using our module's name as a parameter. Flask uses this to resolve resources, and in  complex cases, one can use something other than __name__ here. For our purposes,  we'll always use __name__, which links our module to the Flask object.  Line 3 is a Python decorator. Flask uses decorators for URL routing, so this line of  code means that the function directly below it should be called whenever a user  visits the main root page of our web application  which is defined by the single  forward slash . If you are not familiar with decorators, these are beautiful Python  shortcuts that seem a bit like black magic at first. In essence, they call a function that  takes the function defined under the decorator  in our case, index    and returns a  modified function.   [ 4 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Hello, World!   The next two lines should also seem familiar. They define a very simple function  that returns our message. As this function is called by Flask when a user visits our  application, the return value of this will be what is sent in response to a user who  requests our landing page.  Line 6 is a Python idiom with which you are probably familiar. This is a simple  conditional statement that evaluates to True if our application is run directly.   It is used to prevent Python scripts from being unintentionally run when they   are imported into other Python files.  The final line kicks off Flask's development server on our local machine. We set it to  run on port 5000  we'll use port 80 for production  and set debug to True, which  will help us see detailed errors directly in our web browser.  Running the code To run our development web server, simply fire up a terminal and run the hello.py  file. If you used the same structure outlined in the previous section, the commands  will be as follows:  cd firstapp hello  python hello.py  You should get an output similar to that in the following screenshot:  Also, you should see the process continue to run. This is our web server listening for  requests. So, let's make a request!  Fire up a web browser—I use Firefox, which comes packaged with Ubuntu—and  navigate to localhost:5000.  The localhost part of the URL is a shortcut to the loopback address, usually  127.0.0.1, which asks your computer to make the web request to itself. The number  after the colon  5000  is the port it should make the request to. By default, all HTTP   web  traffic is carried over port 80. For now, we'll use 5000 as it is unlikely to  conflict with any existing services, but we'll change over to port 80 in production,  which is conventional, so that you won't have to worry about the colon.  [ 5 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 1   You should see the "Hello, World!" string displayed in your browser as in the  following screenshot. Congratulations, you've built your first web application   using Flask!  Deploying our application to production It's great to have an application that runs, but inherent to the idea of a web  application is the idea that we want others to be able to use it. As our application  is Python-based, we are a bit limited in how we can run our application on a web  server  many traditional web hosts are only configured to run PHP and or .NET  applications . Let's consider how to serve Flask applications using a Virtual Private  Server  VPS  running Ubuntu Server, Apache, and WSGI. From this point on, we'll maintain two environments. The first is our development  environment, which we just set up and where we'll write code and view its results  using the Flask server running on localhost  as we just did . The second will be  a production environment. This will be a server to which we can deploy our web  applications and make them accessible to the world. When we install new Python  libraries or other software on our development environment, we'll normally want to  mirror our actions in the production environment.  Setting up a Virtual Private Server Although you could, in theory, host your web application on your local machine and  allow others to use it, this has some severe limitations. First of all, every time you  turned off your computer, your app would not be available. Also, your computer  probably connects to the Internet via an Internet Service Provider  ISP  and possibly  a wireless router. This means that your IP address is dynamic and changes regularly,  which makes it difficult for your applications' users to keep up! Finally, chances are  that you have an asymmetrical connection to the Internet, which means that your  upload speed is slower than your download speed.  [ 6 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Hello, World!   Hosting your application on a server solves all of these problems. Before "the cloud"  became popular, the traditional way to host a web application was to buy a physical  server and find a data center to host it. These days, things are far simpler. In a few  minutes, you can fire up a virtual server, which to you seems just like a physical  server—you can log in to it, configure it, and enjoy full control over it—but it is  actually just a virtual "piece" of a machine owned and controlled by a cloud provider. At the time of writing, major players in the cloud provider field include Amazon  Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute, and Digital Ocean. All of  these companies allow you to hire a virtual server or servers upon paying by the  hour. If you are learning Flask as a hobby and are unwilling to pay anyone to host  your web applications, you'll probably find a free trial at one of the providers quite  easily. The smallest offering by any provider is fine to host all the applications that  we'll run. Select one of the preceding providers or another of your choosing. If you've never  done anything similar before, Digital Ocean is often cited to have the simplest  process of signing up and creating a new machine. Once you select a provider,  you should be able to follow their respective instructions to fire up a VPS that runs  Ubuntu Server 14.04 and SSH into it. You'll have full control over the machine with  one slight difference: you won't have a display or a mouse.  You'll enter commands on your local terminal, which will in fact be run on the  remote machine. Detailed instructions on how to connect to your VPS will be   given by the provider, but if you use Ubuntu, it should be as simple as running   the following: ssh user@123.456.789.000  Alternatively, if you set it up with a public-private key authentication, where  yourkey.pem is the full path to your private key file, here's the command to run:  ssh user@123.456.78.000 –i yourkey.pem  Here, user is the default user on the VPS, and yourkey is the name of your private  key file.  SSH from other operating systems:  SSH from OS X should be the same as Ubuntu, but if you're using  Windows, you'll have to download PuTTY. Refer to http:  www. putty.org  to download and for full usage instructions. Note that  if you use key files for authentication, you'll have to convert them to a  format compatible with PuTTY. A conversion tool can also be found on  the PuTTY website.  [ 7 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 1   Once we connect to the VPS, installing Flask is the same process as it was previously:  sudo apt-get update  sudo apt-get install python-pip  pip install --user Flask  To install our web server, Apache, and WSGI, we will run the following:  sudo apt-get install apache2  sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi  Apache is our web server. It will listen for web requests  which are generated by   our users visiting our web application using their browsers  and hand these requests  over to our Flask application. As our application is in Python, we also need WSGI   Web Server Gateway Interface . This is a common interface between web servers and Python applications, which  allows Apache to talk to Flask and vice versa. An overview of the architecture can   be seen in the following diagram:  Configuring our server Now that we've installed Apache, we can see our first results. You're probably used  to visiting websites using a URL, such as http:  example.com. We'll access our web  applications using the IP address of our VPS directly. Your VPS should have a static  public address. Static means that it doesn't change periodically, and public means  that it is globally unique. When you connected to the VPS via SSH, you probably  used the public IP to do this. If you can't find it, run the following on your VPS and  you should see an inet addr section in the output, which contains your public IP: ifconfig  [ 8 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Hello, World!   The IP address should look similar to 123.456.78.9. Enter your IP address into your  browser's address bar, and you should see a page saying "Apache2 Ubuntu Default  Page: It Works!" or something similar, as in the following screenshot:  This means that we can now serve web content to anyone with an Internet  connection! However, we still have to:     Copy our code to the VPS    Link up Apache and Flask    Configure Apache to serve our Flask application  For the first step, we'll set up a Git repository on our local machine and clone the  repository to the VPS. For the second step, we'll use the WSGI module that we installed  with Apache. Finally, we'll take a look at how to write a virtual host to have Apache  serve our Flask application by default.  Installing and using Git Git is a version control system. A version control system, among other things, saves  multiple versions of our code base automatically. This is great to undo accidental  changes or even deletions; we can simply revert to a previous version of our code.  It also includes lots of functionality for distributed development—that is, many  developers working on a single project. We'll use it mainly for its backup and  deployment features, however.  To install Git on your local machine and VPS, run the following commands on each:  sudo apt-get update  sudo apt-get install git  [ 9 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 1   Make sure you're comfortable with the difference between running  commands on your own machine using the terminal and on your  server through the SSH connection. In many cases, we'll need to run  the same commands twice—once for each environment.  Now that you have the software, you need a place to host your Git repositories or  "repos". Two popular and free Git hosting services are GitHub  http:  github. com  and Bitbucket  http:  bitbucket.org . Head over to one of them, create an  account, and create a new repository by following the instructions that they provide.  When given the option to give your repository a name, call it firstapp to match  the name of the directory that we will use for our code base. Once you create a new  repository, you should be given a unique URL to your repository. Take note of this  as we'll use it to push our Hello, World! application using git and then deploy it to  our VPS.  On your local machine, open a terminal and change the directory to the Flask  application. Initialize a new repository and link it to your remote Git repository   via the following commands:  cd firstapp  git init  git remote add origin    Tell git who you are, to allow it to automatically add metadata to your code  changes, as follows:  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"  git config --global user.name "Your Name"  Git allows you full control over which files are part of your repository and which  aren't. Even though we initialized the Git repo in our firstapp directory, our repo  currently contains no files. Add our application to the repo, commit, and then push  it, as follows:  git add hello.py  git commit -m "Initial commit"  git push -u origin master  [ 10 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Hello, World!   These are the main Git commands that we'll use throughout this book, so let's take  a brief look at what each does. The add command adds new or modified files to  our repository. This tells Git which files are actually part of our project. Think of  the commit command as taking a snapshot of our project in its current state. This  snapshot is saved on our local machine. It is good to make a new commit with any  major change to the code base as we can easily revert to previous commits if a later  commit breaks our application. Finally, the push command pushes our local changes  to the remote Git server. This is good for backup, and it will also allow us to fetch the  changes on our VPS, thus keeping the code base on our local machine and that on  our VPS in sync.  Now, SSH into your VPS again and get a copy of our code, as follows:  cd  var www  git clone    Where the   part of the above command  is actually a placeholder for the URL to your Git repository.  If you get a permission denied error on trying to clone the Git repository, you  might need to take ownership of the  var www directory for the Linux user that  you're using. If you logged into the server with tom@123.456.789.123, you can  run the following command, which will give your user ownership of  var www and  allow you to clone the Git repository into it. Again tom is the placeholder used in the  following case:  sudo chown -R tom  var www  If you used firstapp as a name for your remote repository, this should create a new  directory called firstapp. Let's verify that our code is there using the following:  cd firstapp  ls  You should see your hello.py file. Now, we need to configure Apache to use WSGI.  Serving our Flask app with WSGI First, we'll create a very straightforward .wsgi file in our application directory.  Then, we'll create an Apache configuration file in the directory where Apache looks  for available sites.  [ 11 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 1   The only slightly tricky part about these two steps is that we'll create the files directly  on our VPS, and as our VPS does not have a display, this means that we have to use  command-line interface text editors. Of course, we could create the files locally and  then transfer them to our VPS as we did for our code base, but for small changes  to configuration files, this is often more effort than it's worth. Using a text editor  without a mouse takes a bit of getting used to, but it's a good skill to learn. The  default text editor on Ubuntu is Nano, and the other popular choices are vi or Vim.  Some people use Emacs. If you already have a favorite, go with it. If not, we'll use  Nano for the examples in this book  it is already installed and arguably the simplest  to use . However, if you want to go the extra mile, I recommend learning to use Vim.  Assuming you're still connected to your VPS and have navigated to the  var www  firstapp directory as in the most recent steps, run the following command:  nano hello.wsgi  This creates the hello.wsgi file, which you can now edit through Nano. Type the  following:  import sys  sys.path.insert 0, " var www firstapp"   from hello import app as application  This is simply Python syntax, which patches our application into the PATH system  so that Apache can find it through WSGI. We will then import app  we named this   in our hello.py app with the app = Flask __name__  line  into the namespace. Hit Ctrl + X to exit Nano and enter Y when prompted to save the changes. Now, we'll create an Apache configuration file that points to the .wsgi file we just  created, as follows:  cd  etc apache2 sites-available  nano hello.conf  If you run into permission issues while editing or saving files, you may  need to take ownership of the apache2 directory too. Run the following  command, substituting the username for your Linux user: sudo chown –R tom  etc apache2  In this file, we'll create a configuration for an Apache virtual host. This will   allow us to serve multiple sites from a single server, which will be useful later   when we want to serve other applications using our single VPS. In Nano, enter   the following configuration:  [ 12 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Hello, World!         ServerName example.com      WSGIScriptAlias    var www firstapp hello.wsgi     WSGIDaemonProcess hello              WSGIProcessGroup hello        WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}         Order deny,allow         Allow from all          This might look quite complicated, but it's actually very straightforward. We will  create a virtualhost and specify our domain name, where our .wsgi script is, the  name of our application, and who is allowed to access it. We'll discuss domain names  in the final chapter, but for now, you can just leave it as example.com because we'll  access our application by its IP address.  If you get stuck on this step, the Flask website has a great resource on  configuring and troubleshooting Apache configuration. You can find it at  http:  flask.pocoo.org docs 0.10 deploying mod_wsgi .  Hit Ctrl + X and enter Y when prompted again to save and exit the file.   Now, we need to enable the configuration and set it as our default site.  Configuring Apache to serve our Flask application Apache sites work as follows: there is a sites-available directory  where we  created the new virtual host configuration file  and a sites-enabled directory,  which contains shortcuts to all the configuration files that we want to be active.   By default, you'll see a file in the sites-available directory named 000-default. conf. This is the reason that we saw a default It works Apache page when we  first installed Apache. We don't want this anymore; instead, we want to use our  application as the default site. Therefore, we'll disable the default Apache site,  enable our own, and then restart Apache for the changes to take effect. Run these  commands to do this:  sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf  sudo a2ensite hello.conf  sudo service apache2 reload  [ 13 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 1   The required Apache configuration and commands can vary quite  a bit based on the platform you're using. If you use Ubuntu Server  as recommended, the preceding should all work smoothly. If not,  you may need to read up a bit on how to configure Apache for  your specific platform.  You should note reloading web server apache2 in the output. If errors are  displayed, then you probably misconfigured something in the preceding command.  If this is the case, read the error message carefully and go back over the previous  steps to take a look at why things didn't work as expected.  To test that everything is working, open a web browser on your local machine and  type your IP address into the address bar again. You should see Hello, World!  displayed in your browser instead of the default Apache page that we saw before. If you get Error 500 instead, it means that our application fell over for some reason.  Fear not; it's better that you get used to dealing with this error now, when the fix  will probably be simple, than later on, when we've added more components that  could break or be misconfigured. To find out what went wrong, run the following  command on your VPS:  sudo tail –f  var log apache2 error.log  The tail command simply outputs the last several lines of the file passed as an  argument. The -f is for follow, which means that the output will be updated if the  file changes. If you can't immediately work out which lines are indicative of the error  we're looking for, visit the site in your web browser on your local machine again,  and you'll see the output from the tail command be updated accordingly. The  following screenshot shows the output from the tail command when there are no  errors; however, if anything goes wrong, you'll see the error output printed among  all the info messages.  [ 14 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Hello, World!   Some possible tripping points are incorrectly configured WSGI and Apache files   make sure that your WSGIDaemonProcess and daemon name match, for example  or  incorrectly configured Python  you may forget to install Flask on your VPS . If you  can't figure out what the error message means, an Internet search for the message   removing the error-specific parts of your app, such as names and paths  will usually  point you in the right direction. Failing this, there are strong and very friendly Flask  and WSGI communities on Stack Overflow and Google Groups, and there's normally  someone willing to help beginners. Remember that if you're having a problem and  can't find an existing solution online, don't feel bad for asking; you'll help countless  people facing issues similar to yours.  [ 15 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 1   Summary We got through quite a lot of material in this first chapter! We did some initial setup  and house-keeping and then wrote our first web application using Flask. We saw  this run locally and then discussed how to use Git to copy our code to a server.  We configured our server to serve our application to the public; however, our  application is merely a static page that prints the "Hello, World!" string to whoever  visits our page. This is not useful to many people and could be achieved more simply  using a static HTML page. However, with the extra effort we put in, we now have all  the power of Python behind our application; we're just not using it yet!  In the next chapter, we'll discover how to take advantage of Python to make our web  applications more useful!  [ 16 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Hello, World!   Getting Started with Our  Headlines Project  Now that our Hello World application is up and running, we have all the groundwork  in place to create a more useful application. Over the next few chapters, we'll create a  Headlines application that displays up-to-date news headlines, weather information,  and currency exchange rates to our users.  In this chapter, we'll introduce RSS feeds and show how to use them to automatically  retrieve recent news articles from specific publications. In the next chapter, we'll  discuss how to use templates to display headlines and summaries of the retrieved  articles to our users. Chapter 4, User Input for Our Headlines Page Project, will show  you how to get input from users so that they can customize their experience and will  also look at how to add weather and currency data to our application. We'll finish  off the project in Chapter 5, Improving the User Experience of Our Headlines Project, by  adding some CSS styles and looking at how to remember our users' preferences from  one visit to the next.  By the end of this chapter, you'll have learned how to create a more complex Flask  application. We'll pull raw data from real-world news stories and build up HTML  formatting to display this to our user. You'll also learn more about routing—that is,  having different URLs trigger different parts of our application's code.  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:     Setting up our project and a Git repository    Creating a new Flask application Introduction to RSS and RSS feeds     [ 17 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Setting up our project and a Git  repository We could simply edit our Hello World application to add the desired functionality,  but it's cleaner to start a new project. We'll create a new Git repository, a new Python  file, a new .wsgi file, and a new Apache configuration file. We'll do this for each  of the projects in the book, which means that all three of the projects as well as the  original Hello World application will be accessible from our web server. Setting up is very similar to what we did for our Hello World application in Chapter  1, Hello, World! but we'll briefly go through the steps again as we don't have to repeat  a lot of the configuration and installation, as follows:  1.  Log in to your GitHub or BitBucket account and create a new repository   called headlines. Take note of the URL you're given for this blank  repository.  2.  On your local machine, create a new directory called headlines in your   home directory or wherever you put the firstapp directory.  3.  Create a new file in this directory called headlines.py. 4.   In your terminal, change the directory to the headlines directory   and initialize the Git repository by executing the following commands:  cd headlines  git init  git remote add origin    git add headlines.py  git commit -m "initial commit"  git push –u origin master  Now, we're almost ready to push code to our new repository; we just need to   write it first.  Creating a new Flask application To begin with, we'll create the skeleton of our new Flask application, which is pretty  much the same as our Hello World application. Open headlines.py in your editor  and write the following code:  from flask import Flask  app = Flask __name__   [ 18 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Getting Started with Our Headlines Project   @app.route " "  def get_news  :   return "no news is good news"  if __name__ == '__main__':   app.run port=5000, debug=True   This works exactly as before. You can run it in your terminal with python  headlines.py. Open a browser and navigate to localhost:5000 to see the no news  is good news string displayed. However, although the old adage may be true, it's  bad news that our app does not do anything more useful than this. Let's make it  display actual news to our users.  Introduction to RSS and RSS feeds RSS is an old but still widely used technology to manage content feeds. It's been  around for such a long time that there's some debate as to what the letters RSS  actually stand for, with some saying Really Simple Syndication and others Rich Site  Summary. It's a bit of a moot point as everyone just calls it RSS.  RSS presents content in an ordered and structured format using XML. It has several  uses, with one of the more common uses being for people to consume news articles.  On news websites, news is usually laid out similarly to a print newspaper with more  important articles being given more space and also staying on the page for longer.  This means that frequent visitors to the page will see some content repeatedly and  have to look out for new content. On the other hand, some web pages are updated  only very infrequently, such as some authors' blogs. Users have to keep on checking  these pages to see whether they are updated, even when they haven't changed most  of the time. RSS feeds solve both of these problems. If a website is configured to use  RSS feeds, all new content is published to a feed. A user can subscribe to the feeds of  his or her choice and consume these using an RSS reader. New stories from all feeds  he or she has subscribed to will appear in the reader and disappear once they are  marked as read.  As RSS feeds have a formal structure, they allow us to easily parse the headline,  article text, and date programmatically in Python. We'll use some RSS feeds from  major news publications to display news to our application's users.  Although RSS follows a strict format and we could, with not too much trouble,   write the logic to parse the feeds ourselves, we'll use a Python library to do this.   The library abstracts away things such as different versions of RSS and allows   us to access the data we need in a completely consistent fashion.  [ 19 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 2   There are several Python libraries that we could use to achieve this. We'll select  feedparser. To install it, open your terminal and type the following:  pip install --user feedparser  Now, let's go find an RSS feed to parse! Most major publications offer RSS feeds, and  smaller sites built on popular platforms, such as WordPress and Blogger, will often  have RSS included by default as well. Sometimes, a bit of effort is required to find  the RSS feed; however, as there is no standard as to where it should be located, you'll  often see the RSS icon somewhere on the homepage  look at the headers and footers ,  which looks similar to this:  Also, look for links saying RSS or Feed. If this fails, try going to site.com rss or  site.com feed, where site.com is the root URL of the site for which you're looking  for RSS feeds.  We'll use the RSS feed for the main BBC news page. At the time of writing, it is  located at http:  feeds.bbci.co.uk news rss.xml. If you're curious, you can  open the URL in your browser, right-click somewhere on the page, and click on  View Source or an equivalent. You should see some structured XML with a format  similar to the following:             FooBar publishing       http:  dwyer.co.za       A mock RSS feed        en-gb                  Flask by Example sells out         Gareth Dwyer's new book,        Flask by Example sells out in minutes         http:  dwyer.co.za book news flask-by-example         http:  dwyer.co.za book news         flask-by-example         Sat, 07 Mar 2015 09:09:19 GMT               [ 20 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Getting Started with Our Headlines Project   At the very top of the feed, you'll see a line or two that describes the feed itself, such  as which version of RSS it uses and possibly some information about the styles. After  this, you'll see information relating to the publisher of the feed followed by a list of    tags. Each of these represents a story—in our case, a news article. These items  contain information such as the headline, a summary, the date of publication, and a  link to the full story. Let's get parsing!  Using RSS from Python In our headlines.py file, we'll make modifications to import the feedparser  library we installed, parse the feed, and grab the first article. We'll build up HTML  formatting around the first article and show this in our application. If you're not  familiar with HTML, it stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and is used to  define the look and layout of text in web pages. It's pretty straightforward, but if it's  completely new to you, you should take a moment now to go through a beginner  tutorial to get familiar with its most basic usage. There are many free tutorials online,  and a quick search should bring up dozens. A popular and very beginner-friendly  one can be found at http:  www.w3schools.com html .  Our new code adds the import for the new library, defines a new global variable for  the RSS feed URL, and further adds a few lines of logic to parse the feed, grab the  data we're interested in, and insert this into some very basic HTML. It looks similar  to this:  import feedparser  from flask import Flask  app = Flask __name__   BBC_FEED = "http:  feeds.bbci.co.uk news rss.xml"  @app.route " "  def get_news  :   feed = feedparser.parse BBC_FEED    first_article = feed['entries'][0]   return """                  BBC Headlines            {0}             {1}     [ 21 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 2            {2}           """.format first_article.get "title" , first_article. get "published" , first_article.get "summary"    if __name__ == "__main__":   app.run port=5000, debug=True   The first line of this function passes the BBC feed URL to our feedparser library,  which downloads the feed, parses it, and returns a Python dictionary. In the second  line, we grabbed just the first article from the feed and assigned it to a variable.  The entries entry in the dictionary returned by feedparser contains a list of all  the items that include the news stories we spoke about earlier, so we took the first  one of these and got the headline or title, the date or the published field, and  the summary of the article  that is, summary  from this. In the return statement,  we built a basic HTML page all within a single triple-quoted Python string, which  includes the   and   tags that all HTML pages have as well as an    heading that describes what our page is;  , which is a bold tag that shows the news  headline;  , which stands for the italics tag that shows the date of the article; and   , which is a paragraph tag to show the summary of the article. As nearly all items  in an RSS feed are optional, we used the python.get   operator instead of using  index notation  square brackets , meaning that if any information is missing, it'll  simply be omitted from our final HTML rather than causing a runtime error.  For the sake of clarity, we didn't do any exception handling in this example;  however, note that feedparser may well throw an exception on attempting to  parse the BBC URL. If your local Internet connection is unavailable, the BBC server  is down, or the provided feed is malformed, then feedparser will not be able to  turn the feed into a Python dictionary. In a real application, we would add some  exception handling and retry the logic here. In a real application, we'd also never  build HTML within a Python string. We'll look at how to handle HTML properly in  the next chapter. Fire up your web browser and take a look at the result. You should  see a very basic page that looks similar to the following  although your news story  will be different :  [ 22 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Getting Started with Our Headlines Project   This is a great start, and we're now serving dynamic content  that is, content that  changes automatically in response to user or external events  to our application's  hypothetical users. However, ultimately, it's not much more useful than the static  string. Who wants to see a single news story from a single publication that they have  no control over?  To finish off this chapter, we'll look at how to show an article from different  publications based on URL routing. That is, our user will be able to navigate to  different URLs on our site and view an article from any of several publications.  Before we do this, let's take a slightly more detailed look at how Flask handles   URL routing.  URL routing in Flask Do you remember that we briefly mentioned Python decorators in the previous  chapter? They're represented by the funny @app.route " "  line we had above  our main function, and they indicate to Flask which parts of our application should  be triggered by which URLs. Our base URL, which is usually something similar to  site.com but in our case is the IP address of our VPS, is omitted, and we will specify  the rest of the URL  that is, the path  in the decorator. Earlier, we used a single slash,  indicating that the function should be triggered whenever our base URL was visited  with no path specified. Now, we will set up our application so that users can visit  URLs such as site.com bbc or site.com cnn to choose which publication they  want to see an article from.  The first thing we need to do is collect a few RSS URLs. At the time of writing,   all of the following are valid:     CNN: http:  rss.cnn.com rss edition.rss    Fox News: http:  feeds.foxnews.com foxnews latest     IOL: http:  www.iol.co.za cmlink 1.640  First, we will consider how we might achieve our goals using static routing. It's by  no means the best solution, so we'll implement static routing for only two of our  publications. Once we get this working, we'll consider how to use dynamic routing  instead, which is a simpler and more generic solution to many problems.  Instead of declaring a global variable for each of our RSS feeds, we'll build a Python  dictionary that encapsulates them all. We'll make our get_news   method generic  and have our decorated methods call this with the relevant publication. Our  modified code looks as follows:  import feedparser from flask import Flask  [ 23 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 2   app = Flask __name__   RSS_FEEDS = {'bbc': 'http:  feeds.bbci.co.uk news rss.xml',              'cnn': 'http:  rss.cnn.com rss edition.rss',              'fox': 'http:  feeds.foxnews.com foxnews latest',              'iol': 'http:  www.iol.co.za cmlink 1.640'}  @app.route " "  @app.route " bbc"  def bbc  :     return get_news 'bbc'   @app.route " cnn"  def cnn  :     return get_news 'cnn'   def get_news publication :   feed = feedparser.parse RSS_FEEDS[publication]    first_article = feed['entries'][0]   return """                 Headlines            {0}             {1}             {2}           """.format first_article.get "title" , first_article. get "published" , first_article.get "summary"    if __name__ == "__main__":   app.run port=5000, debug=True   Common mistakes:  If you're copying or pasting functions and editing the @app.route  decorator, it's easy to forget to edit the function name. Although  the name of our functions is largely irrelevant as we don't call them  directly, we can't have different functions share the same name as the  latest definition will always override any previous ones.  [ 24 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Getting Started with Our Headlines Project   We still return the BBC news feed by default, but if our user visits the CNN or BBC  routes, we will explicitly take the top article from respective publication. Note that  we can have more than one decorator per function so that our bbc   function gets  triggered by a visit to our base URL or to the  bbc path. Also, note that the function  name does not need to be the same as the path, but it is a common convention that  we followed in the preceding example.  Following this, we can see the output for our application when the user visits   the  cnn page. The headline displayed is now from the CNN feed.  Now that we know how routing works in Flask, wouldn't it be nice if it could   be even simpler? We don't want to define a new function for each of our feeds.   What we need is for the function to dynamically grab the right URL based on the  path. This is exactly what dynamic routing does.  In Flask, if we specify a part of our URL path in angle brackets  , then it is taken  as a variable and is passed to our application code. Therefore, we can go back to  having a single get_news   function and pass in a   variable, which  can be used to make the selection from our dictionary. Any variables specified by the  decorator must be accounted for in our function's definition. The first few lines of the  updated get_news   function are shown as follows:  @app.route " "  @app.route "  "  def get_news publication="bbc" :      rest of code unchanged    In the code shown earlier, we added   to the route definition. This  creates an argument called publication, which we need to add as a parameter of  the function directly below the route. Thus, we can keep our default value for the  publication parameter as bbc, but if the user visits CNN, Flask will pass the cnn  value as the publication argument instead.  [ 25 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 2   The rest of the code remains unchanged, but it's important to delete the now unused  bbc   and cnn   function definitions as we need the default route to activate our  get_news   function instead. It's easy to forget to catch the URL variables in the function definition. Any dynamic  part of the route must contain a parameter of the same name in the function in order  to use the value, so look out for this. Note that we gave our publication variable a  default value of bbc so that we don't need to worry about it being undefined when  the user visits our base URL. However, again, our code will throw an exception if  the user visits any URL that we don't have as a key in our dictionary of feeds. In a  real web application, we'd catch cases such as this and show an error to the user, but  we'll leave error handling for later chapters.  Publishing our Headlines application This is as far as we'll take our application in this chapter. Let's push the results to  our server and configure Apache to display our headlines application instead of our  Hello World application by default.  First, add your changes to the Git repository, commit them, and push them to   the remote. You can do this by running the following commands  after opening   a terminal and changing directory to the headlines directory :  git add headlines.py  git commit –m "dynamic routing"  git push origin master  Then, connect to the VPS with SSH and clone the new project there using the  following commands:  ssh –i yourkey.pem root@123.456.789.123  cd  var www  git clone https:     Don't forget to install the new library that we now depend on. Forgetting to install  dependencies on your server is a common error that can lead to a frustrating  debugging. Keep this in mind. The following is the command for this:  pip install --user feedparser  [ 26 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Getting Started with Our Headlines Project   Now, create the .wsgi file. I assume that you named your Git project headlines  when creating the remote repository and that a directory named headlines  was created in your  var www directory when you did the preceding Git clone  command. If you called your project something else and now have a directory with  a different name, rename it to headlines  otherwise, you'll have to adapt a lot of the  configuration we're about to do accordingly . To rename a directory in Linux, use the  following command:  mv myflaskproject headlines  The command used earlier will rename the directory called myflaskproject to  headlines, which will ensure that all the configuration to follow will work. Now,  run the following:  cd headlines  nano headlines.wsgi  Then, insert the following:  import sys sys.path.insert 0, " var www headlines"  from headlines import app as application  Exit Nano by hitting the Ctrl + X key combo and enter Y when prompted to   save changes.  Now, navigate to the sites-available directory in Apache and create the new  .conf file using the following commands:  cd  etc apache2 sites-available  nano headlines.conf  Next, enter the following:        ServerName example.com      WSGIScriptAlias    var www headlines headlines.wsgi     WSGIDaemonProcess headlines              WSGIProcessGroup headlines        WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}         Order deny,allow         Allow from all          [ 27 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 2   Save the file and quit nano. Now, disable our old site, enable the new one, and restart  Apache by running the following commands:  sudo a2dissite hello.conf  sudo a2enssite headlines.conf  sudo service apache2 reload  Try and visit the IP address of your VPS from your local machine, and if all   went as expected, you should see the news headline as before! If not, don't worry.  It's easy to make a mistake in some piece of configuration. It's most likely that your  headlines.wsgi or headlines.conf file has a small error. The easiest way to find   this is by looking at the most recent errors in your Apache error log, which would   have been triggered when you attempted to visit the site. View this again with the  following command:  sudo tail –fn 20  var log apache2 error.log  Summary That's it for this chapter. The major takeaways of this chapter were taking a look at  how routing, both static and dynamic, are handled in Flask. You also learned a fairly  messy way of formatting data using HTML and returning this to the user.  In the next chapter, we'll take a look at cleaner ways to separate our HTML code  from our Python code using Jinja templates. We'll also have our app display more  than a single news story.  [ 28 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Getting Started with Our Headlines Project   Using Templates in Our  Headlines Project  In the last chapter, we saw one way of combining static HTML with dynamic content  for creating a web page. But it's messy, and we don't want to hack away at Python  strings for building our web pages. Mixing HTML and Python is not ideal for a few  reasons: for one, it means if we ever want to change static text, such as that which  appears in our headings, we have to edit our Python files, which also involves  reloading these files into Apache. If we hire frontend developers to work on HTML,  we run the risk of them breaking the unfamiliar Python code by mistake, and it's  far more difficult to structure any other frontend code such as JavaScript and CSS  correctly. Ideally, we should aim for complete segregation between the frontend and  backend components. We can achieve this to a large extent using Jinja, but as with  most aspects of life, some compromise will be necessary.  By the end of this chapter, we'll have extended our application to display more than  a single headline for the chosen publication. We'll display several articles for each  publication, each one having a link to the original article, and our logic and view  components will largely be separated. In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:  Introducing Jinja        Basic use of Jinja templates    Advanced use of Jinja templates  [ 29 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Introducing Jinja Jinja is a Python template engine. It allows us to easily define dynamic blocks of  HTML which are populated by Python. HTML templates are useful even for static  websites which have multiple pages. Usually, there are some common elements,  such as headers and footers, on every page. Although it is possible to maintain each  page individually for static websites, this requires that a single change be made in  multiple places if the change is made to a shared section. Flask was built on top of  Jinja, so although it is possible to use Jinja without Flask, Jinja is still an inherent part  of Flask, and Flask provides several methods to work directly with Jinja. Generally,  Flask assumes nothing about the structure of your application except what you tell  it, and prefers providing functionality through optional plugins. Jinja is somewhat of  an exception to this. Flask gives you Jinja by default, and assumes that you store all  your Jinja templates in a subdirectory of your application named templates.  Once we've created templates, we'll make calls from our Flask app to render these  templates. Rendering involves parsing the Jinja code, inserting any dynamic data,  and creating pure HTML to be returned to a user's browser. All of this is done  behind the scenes though, so it can get a bit confusing as to what is being done  where. We'll take things one step at a time.  Basic use of Jinja templates The first step to using Jinja templates is creating a directory in our application to  contain our template files, so navigate to your headlines directory, and create a  directory called templates. Unlike the previous steps, this name is expected by  other parts of the application and is case sensitive, so take care while creating it.  At the most basic level, a Jinja template can just be an HTML file, and we'll use  the .html extension for all our Jinja templates. Create a new file in the templates  directory called home.html. This will be the page that our users see when visiting our  application, and will contain all the HTML that we previously had in a Python string.  We'll only be using Jinja to build HTML files in this book, but Jinja  is flexible enough for use in generating any text-based format.  Although we use the .html extension for our Jinja templates, the  files themselves will not always be pure HTML.  For now, put the following static HTML code into this file. We'll look at how to pass  dynamic data between Python and our templates in the next step.                   Headlines   [ 30 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Using Templates in Our Headlines Project                        Headlines           title            published            summary           Now in our Python code, instead of building up the string and returning that in our  routing function, we'll render this template and return it. In headlines.py, add an  import at the top:  from flask import render_template  The render_template function is the magic which takes a Jinja template as input  and produces pure HTML, capable of being read by any browser, as the output.   For now, some of the magic is lost, as we'll give it pure HTML as input and view   the same as output in our browser.  Rendering a basic template In your get_news   function, remove the return statement, which contains our  triple-quoted HTML string as well. Leave the previous lines which grab the data  from feedparser, as we'll be using that again soon.  Update the return statement, so that the get_news   function now looks as follows:  @app.route " "  @app.route "  " def get_news publication="bbc" :   feed = feedparser.parse RSS_FEEDS[publication]    first_article = feed['entries'][0]   return render_template "home.html"   Although our current HTML file is pure HTML and not yet using any of the Jinja  syntax that we'll see later, we're actually already doing quite a bit of magic. This call  looks in our templates directory for a file named home.html, reads this, parses any  Jinja logic, and creates an HTML string to return to the user. Once you've made both  the preceding changes, run your application again with python headlines.py, and  navigate to localhost:5000 in your browser.  [ 31 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 3   Again, we've gone a step backwards in order to advance. If you run the app and  view the result in your browser now, you should see something similar to our  original page, except that instead of the real news data, you'll just see the strings  title, published, and summary as seen in the following image:  Let's take a look at how to populate these fields inside our render_template call so  that we can see real news content again.  Passing dynamic data to our template First, in our Python file, we'll pass each of these as named variables. Update the   get_news   function again, and pass all the data that you need to display to the   user as arguments to render_template  , as follows:  @app.route " "  @app.route "  " def get_news publication="bbc" :   feed = feedparser.parse RSS_FEEDS[publication]    first_article = feed['entries'][0]   render_template "home.html",                     title=first_article.get "title" ,                     published=first_article.get "published" ,                     summary=first_article.get "summary"    The render_template function takes the filename of the template as its first  argument, and can then take an arbitrary number of named variables as subsequent  arguments. The data in each of these variables will be available to the template, using  the variable name.  [ 32 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Using Templates in Our Headlines Project   Displaying dynamic data in our template In our home.html file, we simply need to put two braces on either side of our  placeholders. Change it to look like the following:                   Headlines                       Headlines           {{title}}            {{published}}            {{summary}}           Double braces, {{ }}, indicate to Jinja that anything inside them should not be taken  as literal HTML code. Because our placeholders, title, published, and summary, are  the same as our Python variable names passed into the render_template call, just  adding the surrounding braces means that the render_template call will substitute  these for the real data, returning a pure HTML page. Try it out to make sure that we  can see real news data again, as seen in the following image:  Advanced use of Jinja templates Now we have perfect separation of our backend and frontend components, but our  application doesn't do anything more than it did before. Let's take a look at how to  display multiple news articles from a selected publication. We don't want to add  three new arguments to our render_template call for each article  or dozens of  additional arguments if we ever decide that we want to display more than just the  title, date, and summary of an article .   [ 33 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 3   Fortunately, Jinja can take over some of the logic from Python. This is where we have  to be careful: we spent all that effort to separate our logic and view components, and  when we discover how powerful the Jinja language actually is, it's tempting to move  a lot of the logic into our template files. This would leave us back where we started  with code that is difficult to maintain. However, in some cases it's necessary for our  frontend code to handle some logic, such as now where we don't want to pollute our  backend code with too many repeated arguments.  Using Jinja objects The first thing to learn is how Jinja handles objects. All of the basic Python data  structures, such as variables, objects, lists, and dictionaries, can be understood by   Jinja and can be processed in a very similar way to what we are used to in Python.   For example, instead of passing each of the three components of our article separately  to our template, we could have passed in the first_article object and dealt with   the separation in Jinja. Let's see how to do that. Change the Python code to pass in  a single-named argument to render_template, that is first_article, and the  frontend code to grab the bits we need from this.  The render_template call should now look like this:  render_template "home.html", article=first_article   The template now has a reference called article, which we can use to get the same  result as before. Change the relevant part of the home.html to read as follows:   {{article.title}}    {{article.published    {{article.summary}}   Note that accessing items from a dictionary is slightly different in Jinja as compared  to Python. We use a full stop to access properties, so to access the title of the article,  we use {{article.title}} as in the preceding example, instead of the Python  equivalent article["title"] or article.get "title" . Our code is again neater,  but yet again has no additional functionality.  Adding looping logic to our template Without much extra effort, we can make the whole list of articles available to Jinja.   In the Python code, change the render_template call to read as follows:  render_template "home.html", articles=feed['entries']   [ 34 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Using Templates in Our Headlines Project   You can remove the line directly above the preceding one in the code which defines  the first_article variable, as we won't need it any more. Our template now has  access to the full list of articles that we fetch through feedparser.  In our Jinja template, we could now add {{articles}} or {{articles[0]}} to  see a full dump of all the information we're now passing, or just a dump of the first  article respectively. You can try this as an intermediate step if you're curious, but in  our next step we'll be looping through all the articles and displaying the information  we want.  By giving our template more data to work with, we're passing along some of the  logic responsibility that should ideally be handled by our Python code, but we can  also deal with this very cleanly in Jinja. Similar to the way we use double braces,  {{ }}, to indicate variables, we use the brace and percentage combination, {% %},  to indicate control logic. This will be clearer by looking at an example. Change the    part of the template code to read as follows:         Headlines      {% for article in articles %}          {{article.title}}            {{article.published}}            {{article.summary}}                {% endfor %}    We can see that the Jinja for loop is similar to Python. It loops through the articles list  that we've passed in from the Python code, and creates a new variable, article, for  each iteration of the loop, each time referring to the next item in the list. The article  variable can then be used like any other Jinja variable  using the double braces .  Because whitespace in Jinja is irrelevant, unlike Python, we must define where  our loop ends with the {% endfor %} line. Finally, the   in HTML creates a  horizontal line which acts as a separator between each article.  [ 35 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 3   Run the application locally with the new template file, and view the results in your  browser. You should see something similar to the following image:  Adding hyperlinks to our template Now we want to link each headline to the original article. Our user will probably  find this useful—if a headline seems interesting, he or she can easily get to the full  text of the article to read it. The owner of the RSS feed will also often require or  request that anyone who uses the feed links back to the original articles.  Again,  check for terms and conditions as published along with most big feeds.  Because  we're passing the whole article object to our template already, we won't need to  make any further changes to our Python code to achieve this; we simply need to  make use of the extra data already available to us.  In the template file, search for the following:   {{article.title}}    Change this line to the following:    {{article.title}}     [ 36 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Using Templates in Our Headlines Project   If you're new to HTML, then there's quite a bit going on here. Let's pull it apart: the    tag in HTML indicates a hyperlink  usually displayed by default as blue and  underlined in most browsers , the href attribute specifies the destination or URL of  the link, and the link ends with the   tag. That is, any text between   and    will be clickable, and will be displayed differently by our user's browser. Note that  we can use the double braces to indicate a variable even within the double quotation  marks used to define the destination attribute.  If you refresh the page in your browser, you should now see the headlines as bold  links, as in the following image, and clicking on one of the links should take you to  the original article.  Pushing our code to the server Now is a good time to push the code to our VPS. This is the last time we'll break  down the steps of how to do this, but hopefully, you'd be familiar enough with  Git and Apache by now that there won't be anything unexpected. On your local  machine, from the headlines directory, run:  git add headlines.py  git add templates  git commit -m "with Jinja templates"  git push origin master  [ 37 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 3   And on your VPS  SSH into it as usual , change to the appropriate directory, pull the  updates from the Git repository, and restart Apache to reload the code:  cd  var www headlines git pull sudo service apache2 reload  Make sure everything has worked by visiting the IP address of your VPS from the  web browser on your local machine and checking that you see the same output that  we saw locally, as seen in the following image:  Summary We now have a basic news summary site! You can display recent news from a  number of different websites, see the headline, date, and summary for each recent  article, and can click on any headline to visit the original article. You've only seen a  tiny sample of the power of the Jinja language though—as we expand this project  and other projects in future chapters, you'll see how it can be used for inheritance,  conditional statements, and more.  In the next chapter, we'll add weather and currency information to our application,  and look at ways to interact with our users.  [ 38 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Using Templates in Our Headlines Project   User Input for Our Headlines  Project  Remember how we allowed the user to specify the publication to be viewed by  using   parts in our URL? Although we were effectively getting input  from our user, it's a way of retrieving input that has some pretty heavy limitations.  Let's look at some more powerful ways to interact with our users, and add some  more useful information to our application. We'll be making quite a few incremental  changes to our code files from here on, so remember that you can always refer to the  accompanying code bundle if you need an overview at any point.  In this chapter, we'll look at some more flexible and powerful ways to get input.  We'll also bump into some more advanced Git features along the way, and take a  moment to explain how to use them.  We'll cover the following topics in this chapter:     Getting user input using HTTP GET    Getting user input using HTTP POST    Adding weather and currency data  Getting user input using HTTP GET HTTP GET requests are the simplest way of retrieving input from the user.   You might have noticed question marks in URLs while browsing the Web.   When submitting a term in the search box on the website, your search term   will usually appear in the URL, and look something like this:  example.com search?query=weather  [ 39 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   The bit after the question mark represents a named GET argument. The name  is query and the value, weather. Although arguments like these are usually  automatically created through HTML input boxes, the user can also manually  insert them into the URL, or they can be part of a clickable link that is sent to the  user. HTTP GET is designed to get limited, non-sensitive information from the  user in order for the server to return a page as requested by the GET arguments.  By convention, GET requests should never modify the server state in a way that  produces side effects, that is, the user should be able to make exactly the same  request multiple times and always be given exactly the same results.  GET requests are, therefore, ideal for allowing our user to specify which publication  to view. Let's extend our Headlines project to incorporate selecting a headline based  on a GET request. First, let's modify the Python code to do the following:  Import the request context from Flask        Remove the dynamic URL variable    Check to see if the user has entered a valid publication as a GET argument    Pass the user query and the publication to the template  Update the headlines.py file as follows:  import feedparser from flask import Flask from flask import render_template from flask import request  app = Flask __name__   RSS_FEEDS = {'bbc': 'http:  feeds.bbci.co.uk news rss.xml',              'cnn': 'http:  rss.cnn.com rss edition.rss',              'fox': 'http:  feeds.foxnews.com foxnews latest',              'iol': 'http:  www.iol.co.za cmlink 1.640'}  @app.route " "  def get_news  :         query = request.args.get "publication"          if not query or query.lower   not in RSS_FEEDS:                 publication = "bbc"         else:                 publication = query.lower           feed = feedparser.parse RSS_FEEDS[publication]          return render_template "home.html",          articles=feed['entries']  [ 40 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  User Input for Our Headlines Project   if __name__ == "__main__":     app.run port=5000, debug=True   The first new change is a new import for Flask's request context. This is another piece  of Flask magic that makes our life easier. It provides a global context which our code  can use to access information about the latest request made to our application. This  is useful for us, because the GET arguments that our user passes along as part of a  request are automatically available in request.args, from which we can access   key-value pairs as we would with a Python dictionary  although it is immutable .   The request context simplifies some other parts of request handling as well, which  means that we don't have to worry about threads or the ordering of requests.   You can read more about how the request context works, and what it does, at the   following website:  http:  flask-cn.readthedocs.org en latest reqcontext   We check to see if this has the publication key set by using the get   method,   which returns None. if the key doesn't exist. If the argument is there, we make sure  that the value is valid  that is, it is accounted for by our RSS_FEEDS mapping , and if  it is, we return the matching publication.  We can test out the code by visiting our URL followed by the get argument, for  example: localhost:5000 ?publication=bbc. Unfortunately, from our user's  experience, we've made the application less user-friendly, instead of more. Why did  we do this? It turns out that our user doesn't have to modify the URL by hand—with  a very small change, we can have the URL arguments populated automatically so  that the user doesn't have to touch the URL at all. Modify the home.html template,  and add the following HTML below the heading:               This is quite straightforward, but let's pick it apart to see how it all works. First we  create an HTML form element. By default, this will create an HTTP GET request  when submitted, by passing any inputs as GET arguments into the URL. We have  a single text input which has the name publication. This name is important as the  GET argument will use this. The placeholder is optional, but it will give our user a  better experience as the browser will use it to indicate what the text field is intended  for. Finally, we have another input of type submit. This automatically creates a nice  Submit button for our form which, when pressed, will grab any text in the input and  submit it to our Python backend.  [ 41 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 4   Save the template, and reload the page to see how it works now. You should see the  input form at the top of the page, as seen in the following screenshot. We've gained  a lot of functionality for four lines of HTML, and now we can see that, although GET  arguments initially looked like they were creating more mission and admin, they  actually make our web application much simpler and more user-friendly.  Getting user input using HTTP POST The alternative to HTTP GET is HTTP POST, and it may not always be immediately  obvious which one to use. HTTP POST is used to post larger chunks of data or  more sensitive data to the server. Data sent through POST requests is not visible in  the URL, and although this does not make it inherently more secure  it does not by  default provide encryption or validation , it does offer some security advantages.  URLs are often cached by the browser and suggested through autocomplete features  next time the user types in a similar URL.   [ 42 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  User Input for Our Headlines Project   Data sent through GET requests may, therefore, be retained. Using POST also  prevents someone from seeing the data by looking over the user's shoulder  shoulder  surfing . Passwords especially are often obscured on input by using HTML password  fields, making them appear as asterisks  ********  or dots            in the browser.  The data would still be clearly visible in the URL if sent using GET however, and so  POST should always be used instead.  Although our search query is hardly confidential or excessively long, we're going  to take a moment now to see how we'd implement the same functionality using  POST instead of GET. If you just want to get ahead with finishing off our Headlines  application, feel free to skip this section, but keep in mind that we'll be using POST  requests in later projects without extended explanation. Once we're done with the  POST example, we'll revert our application to the state it is currently in  using the  GET request , as this is much more suitable for our use case.  Creating a branch in Git To make a change to our code base that we're not sure if we want, we'll use   Git's branch functionality. Think of a branch as being like a fork in a road, except   we can at any time change our mind and go back to the decision point. First, we need  to make sure our current branch  master  is up to date—that all our local changes   are committed. Open a terminal, and run the following commands from the  headlines directory:  git add headlines.py git add templates home.html git commit -m "Using GET" git push origin master  We don't strictly need to push it to the server—Git keeps a full revision history locally,  and our changes would still be theoretically safe without the push. However, our code  is in a working state, so there's no harm making the backup to remote. Now we're  going to create the new branch and switch to using it to make our next set of changes:  git branch post-requests git checkout post-requests  We're now working in a new branch of our codebase. Usually, we'd eventually  merge this branch back into our master branch, but in our case, we'll just abandon it  once we're done with what we need. It's quite hard to visualize what's happening as  Git does most things behind the scenes, so it's worth reading up about Git if you're  interested, and are likely to use it for future projects. Otherwise, just think of this as   a checkpoint so that we can freely experiment without the worry of messing up   our code.  [ 43 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 4   Adding POST routes in Flask To use a POST request, we need to make some small changes to our Python   and HTML code. In the headlines.py file, make the following changes:     Change request.args.get to request.form.get    Change @app.route " "  to @app.route " ", methods=['GET',    'POST']   The reason for the first change is that we are now grabbing the user data from a form,  so Flask automatically makes this available to us in request.form. This works the  same way as request.get except that it gathers data from POST requests instead of  from GETs. The second change is not quite as obvious. What we haven't mentioned  before is that all route decorators can specify how the function can be accessed: either  through GET requests, POST requests, or both. By default, only GET is permitted, but  we now want our default page to be accessible by either GET  when we just visit the  home main page and are given BBC as a default , or POST  for when we've requested  the page through our form with the additional query data . The methods parameter  accepts a list of HTTP methods which should be permitted to access that particular  route of our application.  Making our HTML form use POST Our template needs similar changes. Change the opening   tag in the   home.html file to read:     Just as with Flask, HTML forms use GET by default, so we have to explicitly define  that we want to use POST instead. The action attribute isn't strictly necessary, but  usually, when we use POST, we redirect users to a confirmation page or similar, and  the URL for the following page would appear here. In this case, we're explicitly saying  that we want to be redirected to the same page after our form has been submitted.  Save the changes to the Python and HTML files, and refresh the page in your  browser to see the changes take effect. The functionality should be exactly the  same except that we don't see any data in the URL. This can be cleaner for many  applications, but in our case, it is not what we want. For one, we'd like the search  term to be cached by our users' browsers. If a user habitually makes a query for FOX,  we want the browser to be able to autocomplete this after he begins typing in the  URL for our application. Furthermore, we'd like our users to be able to easily share  links that include the query.   [ 44 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  User Input for Our Headlines Project   If a user  let's call him Bob  sees a bunch of interesting headlines after typing cnn  into our application, and wants to share all of these headlines with another user   Jane , we don't want Bob to have to message Jane, telling her to visit our site, and  type a specific query into the search form. Instead, Bob should be able to share a URL  that allows Jane to directly visit the page exactly as he saw it  for example, example. com ?publication=cnn . Jane can simply click on the link sent by Bob and view the  same headlines  assuming she visits our page before the RSS feed is updated .  Reverting our Git repository We need to revert the code to how we had it before. Because all the changes in the  previous section were made in our experimental post-request branch, we don't need  to manually re-edit the lines we changed. Instead, we'll commit our changes to this  branch, and then switch back to our master branch, where we'll find everything as  we left it. In your terminal, run the following:  git add headlines.py  git add templates home.html  git commit –m "POST requests"  git checkout master  Open the headlines.py and templates home.html files to be sure, but they should  be exactly as we left them before experimenting with POST!  Adding weather and currency data Now let's add some more functionality. We're showing media headlines from three  different sources, but our user is probably interested in more than current affairs.  We're going to see how easy it is to display the current weather and some exchange  rates at the top of the page. For the weather data, we'll be using the OpenWeatherMap  API, and for currency data, we'll be using Open Exchange Rates. At the time of writing,  these APIs are freely available, although they both require registration.  [ 45 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 4   Introducing the OpenWeatherMap API In your web browser, visit the URL http:  api.openweathermap.org data 2.5  weather?q=London,uk&units=metric&appid=cb932829eacb6a0e9ee4f38bfbf112 ed. You should see something that looks similar to the following screenshot:  This is the JSON weather data for London which is designed to be read automatically  instead of by humans. Before looking at how to go about reading this data into our  Headlines application, note that the URL we visited has an appid parameter. Even  though the weather data is provided for free, every developer who accesses the data  needs to sign up for a free account with OpenWeatherMap, and get a unique API key  to pass as the value for the appid parameter. This is to prevent people from abusing  the API by making too many requests, and hogging the available bandwidth. At the  time of writing, OpenWeatherMap allows 60 calls to the API per minute and 50,000  per day as part of their free access plan, so it's unlikely that we'll be hitting these  limits for our project.  Signing up with OpenWeatherMap You should sign up for your own API key instead of using the one published in  this book. Generally, your API key should remain a secret, and you should avoid  sharing it  especially avoid publishing it in a book . To get your own API key, head  over to www.openweathermap.org , and complete their sign-up progress by clicking  the sign-up link at the top of the page. Fill out an e-mail address, username, and  password. The registration page should look similar to the following screenshot:  [ 46 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  User Input for Our Headlines Project   Retrieving your OpenWeatherMap API key Once you've signed up, you'll be able to log into OpenWeatherMap. You can the find  your personal API key by navigating to home.openweathermap.org and scrolling  down to the API key text box. You should see your API key as indicated by the red  rectangle in the following image:  Copy the key to your clipboard, as we'll be using it in our Python code soon.  [ 47 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 4   Parsing JSON with Python Now we can access structured weather data over HTTP by using a URL. But doing  so in our browser isn't much good, as we want to read this data automatically from  our Python code. Luckily, Python has a bunch of useful standard libraries for exactly  this use case!  Introducing JSON JSON is a structured data format very similar to a Python dictionary, as should be  apparent from the preceding sample. In fact, in this case it's identical, and we could  very simply convert it to a Python dictionary to use in our Flask application by  loading it as a string and running the built-in Python eval function on it. However,  JSON is not always identical to a Python dictionary. For example, it uses true and  false instead of True and False  note the case difference —and passing anything  that we don't have full control over to eval   is generally a bad idea. Therefore,  we'll use the Python json library to safely parse it. We'll also use the Python  urllib2 library to download the data from the web, and the Python urllib library  to correctly encode URL parameters.  Retrieving and parsing JSON in Python For retrieving and parsing JSON in Python, the first step is to add the three new  imports that we need to our headlines.py file:  import json import urllib2 import urllib  Style tip:  For good Python style, keep the imports ordered alphabetically.  You can read more about the conventions for ordering imports  at the following site: https:  www.python.org dev peps  pep-0008 imports  Now add a new function, get_weather  , which will make a call to the weather API  with a specific query. It's pretty straightforward, and looks like the following code.  Replace the   placeholder with the API key that you copied  from the OpenWeatherMap page.  def get_weather query :     api_url = http:  api.openweathermap.org data 2.5       weather?q={}&units=metric&appid=   [ 48 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  User Input for Our Headlines Project       query = urllib.quote query      url = api_url.format query      data = urllib2.urlopen url .read       parsed = json.loads data      weather = None     if parsed.get "weather" :         weather = {"description":                    parsed["weather"][0]["description"],                   "temperature":parsed["main"]["temp"],                   "city":parsed["name"]                   }     return weather  We use the same URL we looked at earlier in our browser, but we make the query  part-configurable so that the city for which we retrieve the weather data is dynamic.  We use urllib.quote   on the query variable, as URLs cannot have spaces in them,  but the names of the cities that we want to retrieve weather for may contain spaces.  The quote   function handles this for us by, for example, translating a space to "%20 ", which is how spaces are represented in URLs. Then we load the data over HTTP  into a Python string by using the urllib2 library. As in our feedparsing example,  downloading data over the Internet is always potentially unstable, and for a real-world  application, we would need to add some exception handling, and retry logic here.  We then use the json library's loads   function  load string  to convert the JSON string  that we downloaded into a Python dictionary. Finally, we manually build up a simpler  Python dictionary based on the JSON one returned by the API, as OpenWeatherMap  supplies a whole bunch of attributes that we don't need for our application.  Using our weather code Now make two small changes to the get_news   function in order to use our   get_weather   function. We need to call the get_weather   function  for now   we'll just pass in London as a constant , and then pass the weather data to our  template. The get_news   function should now look as follows:  @app.route " "  def get_news  :         query = request.args.get "publication"          if not query or query.lower   not in RSS_FEEDS:                 publication = "bbc"         else:                 publication = query.lower           feed = feedparser.parse RSS_FEEDS[publication]          weather = get_weather "London,UK"   [ 49 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 4           return render_template "home.html",          articles=feed["entries"],          weather=weather   This now loads the simplified data for London into the weather variable, and passes  it along to our template file so that we can display the data to our users.  Displaying the weather data Now we just need to adapt our template to account for the extra data. We'll display  the weather data just above the news headlines, and add some level 2 headings to  keep the different sections of our application organized.  Add the following three lines to the home.html template, right after the opening    tag:       Headlines     Current weather     City:  {{weather.city}}      {{weather.description}} {{weather.temperature}}&8451;     Headlines   There's nothing here that we haven't seen before. We simply grab the sections we  want out of our weather variable using braces. The funny &8451; part is to display  the symbol for degrees Celsius. If you're one of those people who is able to make  sense of the notion of Fahrenheit, then remove the &units=metric from the API  URL  which will tell OpenWeatherData to give us the temperatures in Fahrenheit ,  and display the F symbol for our users by using &8457; in your template instead.  Allowing the user to customize the city As mentioned earlier, we would not always want to display the weather for London.  Let's add a second search box for city! Searching is usually hard, because data input  by users is never consistent, and computers love consistency. Luckily, the API that  we're using does a really good job of being flexible, so we'll just pass on the user's  input directly, and leave the difficult bit for others to deal with.  Adding another search box to our template We'll add the search box to our template exactly as before. This form goes directly  under the Current weather heading in the home.html file.         [ 50 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  User Input for Our Headlines Project          The form defined in the preceding code snippet simply uses a named text input   and a submit button, just like the one we added for the publication input.  Using the user's city search in our Python code In our Python code, we need to look for the city argument in the GET request. Our  get_news   function is no longer well-named, as it does more than simply getting  the news. Let's do a bit of refactoring. Afterwards, we'll have a home   function that  makes calls to get the news and the weather data  and later on the currency data ,  and our get_news   function will again only be responsible for getting news. We're  also going to have quite a few defaults for different things, so instead of hard-coding  them all, we'll add a DEFAULTS dictionary as a global, and whenever our code can't  find information in the GET arguments, it'll fall back to getting what it needs from  there. The changed parts of our code  excluding the imports, global URLs, and the  main section at the end  now look like this:   ...  DEFAULTS = {'publication':'bbc',             'city': 'London,UK'}  @app.route " "  def home  :      get customized headlines, based on user input or default     publication = request.args.get 'publication'      if not publication:         publication = DEFAULTS['publication']     articles = get_news publication       get customized weather based on user input or default     city = request.args.get 'city'      if not city:         city = DEFAULTS['city']     weather = get_weather city  return render_template "home.html", articles=articles,  weather=weather   def get_news query :     if not query or query.lower   not in RSS_FEEDS:         publication = DEFAULTS["publication"]     else:         publication = query.lower       feed = feedparser.parse RSS_FEEDS[publication]   [ 51 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 4       return feed['entries']  def get_weather query :     query = urllib.quote query      url = WEATHER_URL.format query      data = urllib2.urlopen url .read       parsed = json.loads data      weather = None     if parsed.get 'weather' :         weather =           {'description':parsed['weather'][0]['description'],           'temperature':parsed['main']['temp'],           'city':parsed['name']          }     return weather  Now we have a good separation of concerns—our get_weather   function gets  weather data, our get_news   function gets news, and our home   function combines  the two and handles the user's input to display customized data to our visitors.  Checking our new functionality If all went well, we should now have a site that displays customizable news and  weather data. The weather search, as mentioned, is pretty flexible. Give it a go with  some different inputs—you should see a page similar to the following image:  [ 52 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  User Input for Our Headlines Project   Handling duplicate city names The OpenWeatherMap API handles duplicate city names well, although the defaults  are sometimes a bit counter-intuitive. For example, if we search for Birmingham,  we'll get the one in the USA. If we want to look for the Birmingham in the UK,  we can search for Birmingham, UK. In order to not confuse our viewers, we'll  make a small modification for displaying the country next to the city. Then they'll  immediately be able to see if they get results for a city different from what they were  expecting. If you examine the full API response from our weather call, you'll find the  country code listed under sys—we'll grab that, add it to our custom dictionary, and  then display it in our template.  In the get_weather function, modify the line where we build the dictionary:  weather = {'description': parsed['weather'][0]['description'],            'temperature': parsed['main']['temp'],            'city': parsed['name'],            'country': parsed['sys']['country']           }  And in our template, modify the line where we display the city to read as follows:   City:  {{weather.city}}, {{weather.country}}    Check that its working – if you restart the application and reload the page, you  should see that typing Birmingham into to the Current weather search box now  displays the country code next to the city name.  [ 53 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 4   Currency Currency data is considered more valuable than weather data. Many commercial  services offer APIs that are frequently updated and very reliable. However, the free  ones are a bit rare. One service that offers a limited API for free is Open Exchange  Rates—and again, we need to register a free account to get an API key.  Getting an API key for the Open Exchange   Rates API Head over to openexchangerates.com, and complete their registration process.  After clicking on the Sign up link, it may look like they only have paid plans, as  these are more prominently displayed. However, underneath the large paid plan  options, there is a single line of text describing their free offering with a link to select  it. Click on this, and enter your details.  If you are not automatically redirected, head over to your dashboard on their site,  and you'll see your API key  App ID  displayed. Copy this, as we'll need to add it  to our Python code. You can see an example of where to find your API key in the  following screenshot:  [ 54 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  User Input for Our Headlines Project   Using the Open Exchange Rates API The currency API returns JSON just like the weather API, so we can integrate it into  our Headlines application very easily. We need to add the URL as a global, and then  add a new function to calculate rates. Unfortunately, the free version of the API is  restricted to returning all the major currencies against the United States Dollar, so we  will have to calculate our own approximate rates for conversions not involving the  dollar, and rely on a perfect market to keep our information as accurate as possible   see http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Triangular_arbitrage .  Add the variable CURRENCY_URL to your globals below the existing WEATHER_URL,   as seen in the following code snippet. You'll need to substitute your own App ID.  WEATHER_URL =   "http:  api.openweathermap.org data 2.5 weather?q={}  &units=metric&APPID= " CURRENCY_URL =   "https:  openexchangerates.org  api latest.json?  app_id= "  Add the get_rates   function as follows:  def get_rate frm, to :         all_currency = urllib2.urlopen CURRENCY_URL .read            parsed = json.loads all_currency .get 'rates'          frm_rate = parsed.get frm.upper            to_rate = parsed.get to.upper            return to_rate frm_rate  Note the calculation that we do at the end. If the request was from USD to any of the  other currencies, we could simply grab the correct number from the returned JSON.  But in this case, the calculation is simple enough, and it's therefore not worth adding  the extra step of logic to work out if we need to do the calculation or not.  Using our currency function Now we need to call the get_rates   function from our home   function, and   pass the data through to our template. We also need to add default currencies   to our DEFAULTS dictionary. Make the changes as indicated by the highlighted   code that follows:  DEFAULTS = {'publication':'bbc',             'city': 'London,UK',             'currency_from':'GBP',             'currency_to':'USD'  [ 55 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 4   }  @app.route " "  def home  :      get customized headlines, based on user input or default     publication = request.args.get 'publication'      if not publication:         publication = DEFAULTS['publication']     articles = get_news publication       get customized weather based on user input or default     city = request.args.get 'city'      if not city:         city = DEFAULTS['city']     weather = get_weather city       get customized currency based on user input or default     currency_from = request.args.get "currency_from"      if not currency_from:         currency_from = DEFAULTS['currency_from']     currency_to = request.args.get "currency_to"      if not currency_to:         currency_to = DEFAULTS['currency_to']     rate = get_rate currency_from, currency_to      return render_template "home.html", articles=articles,      weather=weather,                            currency_from=currency_from, currency_ to=currency_to, rate=rate   Displaying the currency data in our template Finally, we need to modify our template to display the new data. Underneath the  weather section in home.html, add:   Currency  1 {{currency_from}} = {{currency_to}} {{rate}}  As always, check that everything is working in your browser. You should see  the default currency data of the British Pound to US Dollar conversion as in the  following image:  [ 56 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  User Input for Our Headlines Project   Adding inputs for the user to select currency Now we need to add yet another user input to customize which currencies to  display. We could easily add another text search like we did for the previous two,  but this gets messy. We need two bits of input from the user: the from currency and  the to currency. We could add two inputs, or we could ask the user to enter both into  the same input, but the former makes our page pretty cluttered, and the latter means  we need to worry about properly splitting the user input data  which is almost  certainly not consistent . Instead, let's look at a different input element, the HTML  select. You've almost certainly seen these on other web pages—they're drop-down  menus with a list of values that the user can choose from. Let's see how to build them  in HTML, and how to grab the data from them in Flask.  [ 57 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 4   Creating an HTML select drop-down element First, let's hard-code four currencies in each drop-down menu. The code should be  inserted right below the Currency heading in the home.html template, and it looks  like this:        from:                USD               GBP               EUR               ZAR                    to:               USD              GBP              EUR              ZAR                           The name used for the GET request argument is an attribute of the select tag itself   similar to the name attribute used in our   tags . In our case,  these are currency_from and currency_to, which we specified in our Python code  earlier. The value is slightly more tricky—we have the value that's passed in our GET  request  for example, currency_from=EUR , and then the value that is displayed  to the user. In this case, we'll use the same for both—the currency code—but this is  not compulsory. For example, we could use the full name of the currency, such as  United States Dollar, in the display value, and the code in the value that's passed in  the request. The argument value is specified as an attribute of the option tags, each  a child of  . The display value is inserted between the opening and closing    and   tags.  Test this out to make sure it's working, by saving the template and reloading the  page. You should see drop-down inputs appear, as in the following image:  [ 58 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  User Input for Our Headlines Project   Adding all the currencies to the select input Of course, we could do what we did in the preceding section for the full list. But  we're programmers, not data capturers, so we'll make the list dynamic, insert the  options using a for loop, and keep our template up-to-date and clean. To get the  list of currencies, we can simply take the keys of our JSON all_currency object, in  order to make our get_rate   function return a tuple—the calculated rate and the  list of currencies. We can then pass the  sorted  list to our template, which can loop  through them and use them to build the drop-down lists. The changes for this are  shown as follows:  Make the following changes in the home   function:          if not currency_to:           currency_to=DEFAULTS['currency_to']     rate, currencies = get_rate currency_from, currency_to      return render_template "home.html", articles=articles,      weather=weather,       currency_from=currency_from, currency_to=currency_to,      rate=rate,      currencies=sorted currencies    [ 59 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 4   In the get_rate   function:  frm_rate = parsed.get frm.upper    to_rate = parsed.get to.upper    return  to_rate   frm_rate, parsed.keys     And in the home.html template:           Currency                            from:                         {% for currency in currencies %}                                                        {{currency}}                        {% endfor %}                                          to:                        {% for currency in currencies %}                                                      {{currency}}                       {% endfor %}                                                            1 {{currency_from}} = {{currency_to}} {{rate}}  Displaying the selected currency in the drop-down  input After this, we should easily be able to see the exchange rate for any currency we  want. One minor irritation is that the dropdowns always display the top item by  default. It would be more intuitive for our users if they displayed the currently  selected value instead. We can do this by setting the selected="selected" attribute  in our select tag and a simple, one-line Jinja if statement to work out which line to  modify. Change the for loops for the currency inputs in our home.html template to  read as follows:  For the currency_from loop:  {% for currency in currencies %}     <option value="{{currency}}"       {{'selected="selected"' if currency_from==currency}}>      {{currency}}  {% endfor %}  [ 60 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  User Input for Our Headlines Project   For the currency_to loop:  {% for currency in currencies %}     <option value="{{currency}}"       {{'selected="selected"' if currency_to==currency}}>      {{currency}}  {% endfor %}  Reload the application and the page, and you should now be able to select any of  the available currencies from both select inputs, and after the page has loaded with  the desired currency data, the select inputs should automatically display the current  currencies as well, as seen in the following image. After clicking on the select input,  you should also be able to type on your keyboard and select the option based on the  first letters of what you've typed.  We can now see news, weather, and currency data at the same time! You can refer   to the complete code from the code bundle of the chapter.  [ 61 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 4   Summary In this chapter, we've looked at the difference between the HTTP GET and POST  requests, and discussed where it's good to use which. Although we have no good  use for HTTP POST at the moment, we will use it in future projects where we will be  getting login data from our users. Luckily, the explanatory work we did with HTTP  POST is not lost—we also took a look at some more advanced ways that Git can help  us with version control, and our unused code is safely stored in a different branch  of our code repository in case we need to refer back to it later. Last but not least, we  added weather and currency data to our application, and looked at a few different  options for allowing our user to input data into our application. We're nearly done  with our first project!  In the next chapter, we'll do some cosmetic touch-ups, and look at remembering our  users so that they don't have to carry out exactly the same actions every time they  visit our site.  [ 62 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  User Input for Our Headlines Project   Improving the User  Experience of Our   Headlines Project  Wealthy business people who have to constantly make a good impression to  keep up profitable relations sometimes employ personal assistants to study their  acquaintances. The PA then stands behind the wealthy person at social events and  whispers a few choice words to him or her about someone who is approaching to  converse. The words have to be succinct but informative, such as "Paul Smith. One  child, Jill. Recently travelled, Mauritius". Now, our business person can pretend that  whoever has approached is a dear friend and talk all about his children and travels  at some length without having the faintest clue of who the person actually is. This  makes other people feel important and liked, and this can help our hypothetical  millionaire become even richer.  Why is this relevant to web applications? Well, we want to do exactly the same thing.  Users of our site who feel important and remembered are more likely to come back,  so we need a digital PA to make the user feel as though we've taken the time and  effort to remember who they are and what they like. We could build a database of  our users to store what currency conversions they usually calculate and which cities'  weather they are interested in and then display these to them by default. The issue  with this strategy is that we'd need them to identify themselves with every visit,  and most users would find the extra step of entering a username, and possibly a  password, tedious and off-putting.  [ 63 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Enter HTTP cookies. These sly little things will lurk on our users' computers and  act as digital PAs for us when our users make a second visit to our site, giving us  information that we've acquired before but haven't bothered to remember. This  sounds pretty underhand. At one point, the European Union thought this way and  attempted to regulate the use of cookies, but they are everywhere and are simple  and useful, and the regulation attempts were a bit underwhelming  take a look at  http:  silktide.com the-stupid-cookie-law-is-dead-at-last  .  In their simplest form, cookies are simply key-value pairs that we store on our users'  machines and ask their browser to automatically send back to us whenever they visit  our site. The pros of this are that we don't have to keep and maintain a database and  we don't have to explicitly ask users to tell us who they are. However, the cons are  that we don't have control of the information and if a user changes computers, web  browsers, or even just deletes our cookies, we'll no longer be able to identify him or  her. Cookies are, therefore, perfect for an application such as the one we've built; it's  not the end of the world if a user has to click a few times to get back to the media,  currency, and weather information he or she searched for the last time, but it's nice if  we can remember previous choices and display these automatically.  While we're on the topic of user experience  or UX as it's often referred to , our site  looks as though it was made in the 1980s. We'll have a stronger focus on aesthetics in  later chapters, but for now we'll also take a look at how to add some basic layout and  colors to our site. As we're focusing on functionality and simplicity, it'll still be far  from "modern-looking", but we'll add some building blocks to our toolkit that we'll  use more carefully later on. We'll use Cascading Style Sheets  normally just called  CSS  to achieve this. CSS is a great tool to enable a further separation of concerns;  we have already mainly separated our logic  that is, our Python script  from our  content  that is, our HTML templates . Now, we'll take a look at how CSS can help us  separate our formatting  that is, the color, font, layout, and so on  from the rest of our  content, such as the static text in our template files.  Now that we've had an overview of cookies and CSS, we'll get to looking at  implementing them in Flask. This is the final chapter of our first project, and   by the end of it, we'll have a Headlines application that includes cookies and CSS.  In this chapter, we'll look at the following topics:     Adding cookies to our Headlines application    Adding CSS to our Headlines application  [ 64 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Improving the User Experience of Our Headlines Project   Adding cookies to our Headlines  application Our application, at this point, has a couple of issues. Let's imagine a user, Bob,  who lives in Seattle. Bob visits our site and sees the defaults for BBC, London, and  conversion of GBP to USD. Bob wants to see the weather for Seattle, so he types  Seattle into the Weather search bar and hits Enter. He glances at the returned  weather and feels pretty depressed that it's cold and raining as usual, so he looks  away from the weather further down the page and sees the BBC headlines. He would  prefer CNN headlines, so he selects this publication from the drop-down menu and  hits Submit. He reads through a couple of headlines before realizing that current  affairs are even duller and more depressing than the weather. So, his eyes move  back to the top of the page again to cheer himself up. He's confused; since changing  his publication preference, the weather has defaulted back to London, where the  weather is even worse! He closes our application and doesn't come back. If he were  to come back, everything would display the defaults again.  The two immediate problems are:     Not remembering our users' choices even while they stay on our site    Not remembering our users' choices after they close our site and revisit at a   later stage  Let's fix both of these issues.  Using cookies with Flask Cookies, as introduced earlier, can be thought of as key-value pairs that we may or  may not receive by default from return visitors. We need to change our app so that  when a user makes choices, we create or update their cookie to reflect these changes,  and when a user requests our site, we check to see whether a cookie exists and read  as much of the unspecified information from this as possible. First, we'll look at how  to set cookies and have our user's browser automatically remember information, and  then we'll look at retrieving the information that we previously used cookies to store.  [ 65 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 5   Setting cookies in Flask Flask makes dealing with cookies as easy as ever. First, we need a couple more  imports; we'll use the datetime library from Python to set the lifespan of our   soon-to-exist cookies, and we'll use Flask's make_response   function to create  a response object that we can set cookies on. Add the following two lines to your  imports section in the headlines.py file:  import datetime from flask import make_response  Earlier, we were simply rendering our template with the custom arguments and then  returning it to our users' web browsers. In order to set cookies, we need an extra  step. First, we'll create a response object with our new make_response   function  and then set our cookie using this object. Finally, we'll return the entire response,  which includes the rendered template and the cookies.  Substitute the last line of our home   function in headlines.py with the   following lines:  response = make_response render_template "home.html",     articles=articles,     weather=weather,     currency_from=currency_from,     currency_to=currency_to,     rate=rate,     currencies=sorted currencies    expires = datetime.datetime.now   + datetime.timedelta days=365  response.set_cookie "publication", publication, expires=expires  response.set_cookie "city", city, expires=expires  response.set_cookie "currency_from",     currency_from, expires=expires  response.set_cookie "currency_to", currency_to, expires=expires  return response  This is quite a big change from the simple return statement we had, so let's   break it down a bit. First, we will wrap a make_response   call around our   render_template   call instead of returning the rendered template directly.   This means that our Jinja templates will be rendered, and all the placeholders will  be replaced with the correct values, but instead of returning this response directly to  our users, we will load it into a variable so that we can make some more additions to  it. Once we have this response object, we will create a datetime object with a value  of 365 days from today's date. Then, we will do a series of set_cookie   calls on our  response object, saving all the user's selections  or refreshing the previous defaults   and setting the expiry time to a year from the time the cookie was set using our  datetime object.   [ 66 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Improving the User Experience of Our Headlines Project   Finally, we will return our response object, which contains the HTML for the  rendered template, and our four cookie values. On loading the page, our user's  browser will save the four cookies, and we'll be able to retrieve the values if the   same user visits our application again.  Retrieving cookies in Flask Remembering the information is not much good if we don't do anything with it.   We now set cookies as the final step before we send a response to our users.  However, we need to check for the saved cookies when a user sends us a request.   If you remember how we got named arguments from Flask's request object, you  could probably guess how to get saved cookies. The following line will get the   cookie named publication if it exists:  request.cookies.get "publication"   This is simple, right? The only tricky part is getting our fallback logic correct.  We still want explicit requests to take the highest priority; that is, if a user enters  text or selects a value from a drop-down menu, this will be what he or she wants  irrespective of what we expect from previous visits. If there is no explicit request,   we will look in the cookies to check whether we can grab a default from there.  Finally, if we still have nothing, we will use our hardcoded defaults. Writing the fallback logic to check for cookies Let's just implement this logic for publication first. Add a new if block to   our publication logic in the home   function of headlines.py to make it match   the following:   get customised headlines, based on user input or default publication = request.args.get "publication"  if not publication:     publication = request.cookies.get "publication"      if not publication:         publication = DEFAULTS["publication"]  Now, we will look in the GET arguments, fall back if necessary on the saved  cookies, and finally fall back on our default value. Let's take a look at this working.  Open your web browser and navigate to localhost:5000. Search for Fox in the  Publication search bar and wait for the page to reload with Fox News headlines.  Now, close your browser, reopen it, and load localhost:5000 again. This time,   you should see the Fox headlines without having to search for them, as in the  following screenshot.   [ 67 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 5   Note that there is no publication argument in the URL, and yet the headlines  themselves are now from Fox News.  Retrieving the cookies for other data We have basic cookies working for our publication, but we still want to read the  cookies we potentially saved for weather and currency options. We could simply add  the same if statement to each section of our code, substituting city, currency_from,  and currency_to for publication as relevant, but making the same changes in  many parts of our code is a strong sign that we need to do some refactoring.  Let's create a get_value_with_fallback   function instead that implements our  fallback logic on a more abstract level. Add the new function to the headlines.py  file and call it from the home   function, as shown here:  def get_value_with_fallback key :     if request.args.get key :         return request.args.get key      if request.cookies.get key :         return request.cookies.get key   [ 68 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Improving the User Experience of Our Headlines Project       return DEFAULTS[key]  @app.route " "  def home  :      get customised headlines, based on user input or default     publication = get_value_with_fallback "publication"      articles = get_news publication        get customised weather based on user input or default     city = get_value_with_fallback "city"      weather = get_weather  city        get customised currency based on user input or default     currency_from = get_value_with_fallback "currency_from"      currency_to = get_value_with_fallback "currency_to"      rate, currencies = get_rate currency_from, currency_to        save cookies and return template     response = make_response render_template "home.html",         articles=articles,         weather=weather, currency_from=currency_from,         currency_to=currency_to, rate=rate,         currencies=sorted currencies        expires = datetime.datetime.now   +         datetime.timedelta days=365      response.set_cookie "publication", publication,         expires=expires      response.set_cookie "city", city, expires=expires      response.set_cookie "currency_from",         currency_from, expires=expires      response.set_cookie "currency_to",         currency_to, expires=expires      return response  Now, we should be able to submit the forms in any order and have all our  options remembered as we would expect. Also, whenever we visit our site, it will  automatically be configured with our most recently used options. Give it a go!   You should be able to search for currency, weather, and headlines; then, close your  browser; and revisit the site. The inputs you used most recently should appear   by default.   [ 69 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 5   In the following screenshot, we can see that no arguments are passed in the URL,  and yet we are displaying weather data for Port Elizabeth in South Africa; currency  data from the Chinese Yuan  CNY  to Saint Helena Pound  SHP ; and headlines  from Fox News.  Adding CSS to our Headlines application Our site remains pretty bare. There's a lot of white and some black. Most users prefer  color, animations, borders, margins, and so on. As mentioned before, we're not really  going to focus on aesthetics now, but we'll add some basic colors and styles.  External, internal, and inline CSS There are a few ways that CSS can be added to a web page. The best way is to keep it  completely separate from the HTML and save it in an external file, which is included  in the HTML in a   element. This is sometimes referred to as the external CSS.  The worst way is called inline CSS. Using the inline method, CSS is defined on a per  element basis; this is considered bad practice as any changes to style require trawling  through HTML to find the relevant sections.   [ 70 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Improving the User Experience of Our Headlines Project   Furthermore, many elements on a page often have the same or at least related  styles to maintain color schemes and styles throughout the site. Using inline styles,  therefore, often leads to a lot of code repetition, which we know to avoid.  For this project, we'll take a middle ground. We'll keep our CSS defined in our .html  template files, but we'll define it all in a single place. This is because we haven't yet  looked at how Flask handles files by convention, so keeping all our code in one place  is simpler for now.  Adding our first CSS CSS is quite straightforward; we will describe elements of our page by type, ID,  class, and so on and define a number of properties for these, such as color, layout,  padding, fonts, and so on. CSS is designed to cascade, that is, if we don't specify for  a more specific element, it'll automatically inherit properties defined for a more  general element. We'll go through the CSS itself fairly quickly, so if you've never  heard of it before and would like to know more about it, now is the opportune  moment to take a break and go through some CSS-specific resources. There are a lot  of them online that a quick search will reveal; if you enjoyed the W3Schools HTML  tutorial we mentioned earlier, you can find a similar CSS one here at http:  www. w3schools.com css . Alternatively, dive in the deep end with the examples and  brief explanations that follow!  First, let's add a better header to our site. We'll add a tagline beneath our top level  heading, and surround it with a new   tag so that we can modify the entire  header in the upcoming CSS. Modify the start of the home.html template to look   as follows:         Headlines       Headlines. Currency. Weather.           The   tag doesn't do anything by itself, and you can think of it as a container.  We can use it to group logically related elements into the same element, which is  very useful for CSS as we can then style all of the elements in a   tag at once.  CSS should be added into the   section of our template inside a   tag.  Underneath the   tag in our home.html template, add the following code:    html {     font-family: "Helvetica";     background: white;  [ 71 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 5   }  body {     background: lightgrey;     max-width: 900px;     margin: 0 auto; }            header {     background: lightsteelblue; }    We defined the styles explicitly for three elements: the outer   element, the    element, and any element with an id="header" attribute. As all of our  elements are within our   element, the font cascades automatically down  everywhere  although it could still be overwritten explicitly by subelements . We  set everything in our body element  which contains all the visible items of the page   to have a maximum width of 900 pixels. The margin: 0 auto; line means that  there will be no margin at the top and bottom of the body, and an automatic margin  on the left- and right-hand sides. This has the effect of centering everything on the  page. The background: white; and background: lightgrey; lines mean that  we'll have a centered main element with a light grey background inside the larger  window, which is white. Finally, our defined header div will have a lightsteelblue  background. Save the page with the added styles and refresh to see the effect. It  should look similar to the following image:  [ 72 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Improving the User Experience of Our Headlines Project   Let's take a look at how we can improve the aesthetics in the next section.  Browsers and caching  Browsers often cache content that doesn't change often locally in order  to display pages more quickly the next time you visit them. This is not  ideal for development as you want to see the changes as you make  them. If your styles don't seem to be doing what you'd expect, clear  your browser's cache and try again. This can be done on most browsers  by pressing Ctrl + Shift + ESC and selecting the relevant options from  the menu that pops up.  Adding padding to our CSS This is slightly more interesting than black on white, but it's still pretty ugly.   One problem is that the text is right up against the margin of the color without   any breathing room. We can fix this using CSS padding, which moves everything   over from the top, right, bottom, left, or any combination by specified amounts.  We could add padding directly to our   tag as we want a nice left-hand side  buffer for all the text. If you try this, you'll see the immediate issue; the padding will  affect everything, including our   header and the   tag that separates it from  the rest of our content, which means that there will be a weird stripe of grey that isn't  what we want. We'll fix the issue in a way that you'll soon use for nearly everything  CSS-related—just add more divs! We need a main   header around all our  subheadings and an inner header div so that we can pad the text in our header  without padding the background color or the separator.  Adding more styles to our CSS Add the following sections to your CSS to define left-hand side padding for our main  and inner header divs and update the header section to include some top padding:  header {   padding-top: 5;   background: lightsteelblue; } inner-header {   padding-left: 10; } main{   padding-left: 10; }  [ 73 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 5   Adding the div tags to the template file Now, let's add the divs themselves; the template code in home.html should be  updated to look as follows:                                                 Headlines                   Headlines. Currency. Weather.                                                               Current weather   ... [ rest of the content code here ] ...              {% endfor %}                  Styling our inputs This makes the layout a bit more pleasant to look at because the text doesn't look  like it's trying to sneak off the edge. The next major pain point is our input elements,  which are very boring. Let's add some style to them as well. At the bottom of the CSS  we have so far, add the following text:  input[type="text"], select {     color: grey;     border: 1px solid lightsteelblue;     height: 30px;     line-height:15px;     margin: 2px 6px 16px 0px; } input[type="submit"] {     padding: 5px 10px 5px 10px;     color: black;     background: lightsteelblue;     border: none;     box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px 4C6E91; } input[type="submit"]:hover{     background: steelblue; }  [ 74 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Improving the User Experience of Our Headlines Project   The first section styles our text input and select  that is, drop-down  elements. The  text color is grey, it has a border that is of the same color as our heading, and we will  make them a little bit bigger than the default ones we had before using height and  line height. We also need to adjust the margins to make the text fit in the new size  more naturally  if you're curious, leave out the margin line at the bottom of the first  section and look at the result.  The second and third sections are to style our Submit  buttons; one to define how they usually look and the other to define how they look  when the mouse moves over them. Again, save these changes and refresh the page to  see how they look. You should see something similar to the following screenshot:  The final result will still not win any design awards, but at least you've learned   the basics of CSS. One of the most frustrating parts of designing web pages is that  each browser interprets CSS slightly differently  or in some cases, very differently .  Cross-browser testing and validation is every web developer's arch nemesis, and in  later chapters, we'll look at some tools and frameworks that can be used to mitigate  the issues that arise from this potential lack of consistency.  [ 75 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 5   Summary We've made our site a bit more user-friendly in this chapter, both in terms of  functionality  by remembering our users' choices through cookies  and aesthetics   using CSS . We'll come back to both of these topics in later projects, in which we'll  use cookies to allow users to log in and some more advanced CSS. This is the end  of our Headlines project; we have a functioning Headlines application that displays  news, weather, and currency information.  In the next chapter, we'll start building a new project: an interactive crime map.  [ 76 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Improving the User Experience of Our Headlines Project   Building an Interactive   Crime Map  Our first project notably lacked any sort of long term memory. Although we worked  around the issues using cookies to simulate long-term storage, we also saw the  limitations of these. In this project, we'll build an interactive crime map that allows  users to tag locations with details of witnessed or experienced criminal activities.   As we want to keep the data for the long term and make it available to many users,   we cannot rely on our users' local and temporary storage.  Therefore, the first step to our project will be setting up a MySQL database on our  VPS and linking this to a new Flask web application. We'll use the Google Maps API  to allow users to view our map and add new markers to it  in which each marker  represents a crime .  We'll also have some more advanced user input than in our previous project, allowing  users to filter their view of the map and add fairly complex data to the map. Therefore,  we'll have a stronger focus on input validation and sanitization.  Our goal for the project is a web page containing an interactive map. The user should  be able to submit new crimes by choosing a location for the map and entering a  date, category, and description of the crime. The user should also be able to view  all the previously recorded crimes as icons on the map and more details about any  specific crime by selecting the relevant icon from the map. The point of the map is to  be able to easily view areas with high crime rates as well as to assist investigators in  detecting patterns and trends in crime.  A substantial chunk of this chapter is devoted to setting up a MySQL database on  our VPS and creating a database for the crime data. This will be followed by us  setting up a basic page containing a map and text box. We'll see how to link Flask to  MySQL by storing data entered into the text box in our database.  [ 77 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   As in the previous project, we'll avoid the frameworks and automation tools that we'd  almost certainly use in a "real-world" project. As we will focus on learning, a lower  level of abstraction is useful. Therefore, we won't be using Object-relational Mapping   ORM  for our database queries or a JavaScript framework for user input and  interaction. This means that there will be some laborious writing of SQL and vanilla  JavaScript, but it's important to fully understand why the tools and frameworks exist  and what problems they solve, before diving in and using them blindly.  In this chapter, we'll cover:     Setting up a new Git repository    Understanding relational databases    Installing and configuring MySQL on our VPS    Creating our Crime Map database in MySQL    Creating a basic database web application  Setting up a new Git repository We'll create a new Git repository for our new code base as, although some of the  setup will be similar, our new project should be completely unrelated to our first one.  If you need more help with this step, head back to Chapter 1, Hello, World!, and follow  the detailed instructions in the Installing and using Git section. If you feel confident,  check whether you can do this just with the following summary:     Head over to the website for Bitbucket, GitHub, or whichever hosting   platform you used for the first project. Log in and create a new repository     Name your repository crimemap and take note of the URL you're given    On your local machine, fire up a terminal and run the following commands:  mkdir crimemap  cd crimemap  git init  git remote add origin    We'll leave this repository empty for now as we need to set up a database on   our VPS. Once we have the database installed, we'll come back here to set up   our Flask project.  [ 78 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Building an Interactive Crime Map   Understanding relational databases In its simplest form, a relational database management system, such as MySQL, is  a glorified spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel. We use it to store data in  rows and columns. Every row is a "thing" and every column is a specific piece of  information about the "thing" in the relevant row. I put "thing" in inverted commas  because we're not limited to storing objects. In fact, the most common example of  a thing, both in the real world and in explaining databases, is data about people. A  basic database storing information about customers of an e-commerce website could  look something similar to the following:  ID 1 2 3  First name Frodo Bilbo Samwise  Surname Baggins Baggins Gamgee  E-mail address fbaggins@example.com bbaggins@example.com sgamgee@example.com  Telephone +1 111 111 1111 +1 111 111 1010 +1 111 111 1001  If we look from the left to the right in a single row, we will get all the information  about one person. If we look in a single column from the top to the bottom, we will  get one piece of information  for example, an e-mail address  for everyone. Both  can be useful; if we want to add a new person or contact a specific person, we will  probably be interested in a specific row. If we want to send a newsletter to all our  customers, we will just be interested in the e-mail column.  So, why can't we just use spreadsheets instead of databases then? Well, if we take  the example of an e-commerce store further, we will quickly see the limitations. If  we want to store a list of all the items we have on offer, we can create another table  similar to the preceding with columns such as Item name, Description, Price, and  Quantity in stock. Our model continues to be useful; however, now, if we want  to store a list of all the items Frodo has ever purchased, there's no good place to put  the data. We could add 1,000 columns to our customer table  as seen earlier , such  as Purchase 1, Purchase 2, and so on until Purchase 1000, and hope that Frodo  never buys more than 1,000 items. This is neither scalable nor easy to work with.  How do we get the description for the item Frodo purchased last Tuesday? Do we  just store the name item in our new column? What happens with items that don't  have unique names?  Soon, we will realize that we need to think about it backwards. Instead of storing the  items purchased by a person in the Customers table, we need to create a new table  called Orders, and store a reference to the customer in every order. Thus, an order  "knows" which customer it belongs to, but a customer has no inherent knowledge of  which orders belong to him her.  [ 79 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 6   While our model still fits into a spreadsheet at a push, as we grow our data model  and size, our spreadsheet becomes more cumbersome. We need to do complicated  queries, such as "I want to see all items that are in stock, have been ordered at least  once in the last six months, and cost more than $10". Enter Relational Database Management Systems  RDBMS . They've been around  for decades and are a tried-and-tested way of solving a common problem  such as  storing data with complicated relations in an organized and accessible manner . We  won't touch on their full capabilities in our Crime Map  in fact, we could probably  store our data in a text file if we needed to , but if you're interested in building web  applications, you will need a database at some point. So, let's start small and add the  powerful MySQL tool to our growing toolbox.  I highly recommend that you learn more about databases! If the you experience in  building our current project takes your fancy, go read and learn about databases. The  history of RDBMS is interesting, and the complexities and subtleties of normalization  and database varieties  including NoSQL databases, which we'll see some of in our  next project  deserve more study time than we can devote to them in a book that  focuses on Python web development.  Installing and configuring MySQL on   our VPS Installing and configuring MySQL is an extremely common task. You can, therefore,  find it in prebuilt images or in scripts that build entire stacks for you. A common  stack is called the LAMP stack, which stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP,  and many VPS providers provide a one-click LAMP stack image.  As we will use Linux and have already installed Apache manually, after installing  MySQL, we'll be very close to the traditional LAMP stack; we will just use the P for  Python instead of PHP. In keeping with our goal of "education first", we'll install  MySQL manually, and configure it through the command line instead of installing a  GUI control panel. If you've used MySQL before, feel free to set it up as you see fit.  MySQL and Git  Keep in mind that neither our setup of MySQL nor the data we store  in it is part of our Git repository. Be careful as any mistakes made at  a database level, including misconfiguration or deleting data, will be  harder to undo.  [ 80 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Building an Interactive Crime Map   Installing MySQL on our VPS Installing MySQL on our server is quite straightforward. SSH into your VPS and run  the following commands:  sudo apt-get update  sudo apt-get install mysql-server  You should see an interface prompting you for a root password for MySQL.   Enter a password and repeat it where prompted. Once the installation is complete,  you can get a live SQL shell by typing the following:  mysql –p  Then, enter the password you chose earlier when prompted. We could create   a database and schema using this shell, but we'd rather do this through Python;   so, type quit and hit the Enter key to terminate the MySQL shell if you opened it.  Installing Python drivers for MySQL As we want to use Python to talk to our database, we need to install another package.  There are two main MySQL connectors for Python: PyMySQL and MySQLdb. The  first is preferable from a simplicity and ease-of-use point of view. It is a pure Python  library, which means that it has no dependencies. MySQLdb is a C extension and  therefore has some dependencies, but it is a bit faster in theory. They work very  similarly once installed. We'll use PyMySQL in our examples throughout this chapter.  To install it, run  while still on your VPS  the following command:  pip install --user pymysql  Creating our Crime Map database   in MySQL Some knowledge of SQL's syntax will be useful for the rest of this chapter, but you  should be able to follow either way. The first thing we need to do is create a database  for our web application. If you're comfortable using a command-line editor, you can  create the following scripts directly on the VPS as this can make them easier to debug  and we won't run them locally. However, developing over an SSH session is far from  ideal; so, I recommend that you write them locally and use Git to transfer them to the  server before running.   [ 81 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 6   This may make debugging a bit frustrating, so be extra careful in writing these scripts.  If you want, you can get them directly from the code bundle that comes with this  book. In this case, you simply need to populate the user and password fields in the  dbconfig.py file. correctly, and everything should work.  Creating a database setup script In the crimemap directory in which we initialized our Git repository at the   beginning of the chapter, create a python file called db_setup.py containing   the following code:  import pymysql import dbconfig connection = pymysql.connect host='localhost',                              user=dbconfig.db_user,                              passwd=dbconfig.db_password   try:         with connection.cursor   as cursor:                 sql = "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS crimemap"                 cursor.execute sql                  sql = """CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS crimemap.crimes   id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, latitude FLOAT 10,6 , longitude FLOAT 10,6 , date DATETIME, category VARCHAR 50 , description VARCHAR 1000 , updated_at TIMESTAMP, PRIMARY KEY  id   """                 cursor.execute sql ;         connection.commit   finally:         connection.close    Let's take a look at what this code does. First, we imported the PyMySQL library  we just installed. We also imported dbconfig, which we'll create locally in a bit  and populate with the database credentials  we don't want to store these in our  repository . Then, we will create a connection to our database using localhost   because our database is installed on the same machine as our code  and the  credentials that don't exist yet.  [ 82 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Building an Interactive Crime Map   Now that we have connection to our database, we can get a cursor. You can think  of a cursor a bit like the blinking object in your word processor that indicates where  text will appear when you start typing. A database cursor is an object that points to a  place in the database where we want to create, read, update, or delete data. Once we  start dealing with database operations, there are various exceptions that could occur.  We'll always want to close our connection to the database, so we will create a cursor   and do all the subsequent operations  inside a try block with connection.close    in a finally block  the finally block will get executed whether or not the try   block succeeds .  The cursor is also a resource, so we'll grab one and use it in a with: block so that it'll  automatically be closed when we're done with it. With the setup done, we can start  executing the SQL code.  When we call the cursor.execute   function, the SQL code we will pass in will be  run using the database engine, and the cursor will be populated with results if they  are appropriate. We'll discuss later how we can read and write data using the cursor  and the execute   function.  Creating the database SQL reads similarly to English, so it's normally quite straightforward to work out what  the existing SQL code does, even if it's a bit trickier to write new code. Our first SQL  statement creates a crimemap database if it doesn't already exist  this means that if we  come back to this script, we can leave this line in without deleting the entire database  every time . We will create our first SQL statement as a string and use the sql variable  to store it. Then, we will execute the statement using the cursor we created.  Looking at our table columns Now that we know we have a database, we can create a table. The table will store  the data for all the crimes that we record, with each crime in a row of the table.  Therefore, we need several columns. Each column can be seen in our create table  statement along with the type of data that will be stored in this column. To break  these down, we have:      id: This is a unique number that's automatically recorded for every crime  we have. We don't need to worry too much about this field as MySQL will  automatically insert it for us every time we add new crime data—starting   at 1 and incrementing as required.     Latitude and longitude: These fields will be used to store the location of each   crime. We will specify  10, 6  after the floats which means that each float  can be up to 10 digits and up to 6 digits can be after the decimal point.  [ 83 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 6      Date: This is the date and time of the crime.    Category: We will define several categories to classify different types of   crime. This will help in filtering the crimes later. VARCHAR 50  means that  this will be data of variable length and up to 50 characters long.     Description: This is similar to Category but with a maximum of 1000   characters.     Updated_at: This is another field that we don't need to worry about. MySQL   will set this to the current time when we insert the data or edit it. This could be  useful if we want to, for example, remove a bunch of data that was inserted by  mistake at a specific time.  Indexing and committing The last line of our create table query specifies our id column as a primary  key. This means that it'll be indexed  and therefore, we'll be able to find data very  efficiently if we use it when we query our database , and will have various other  useful properties, such as enforced existence and uniqueness.  Once we define this more complicated piece of SQL, we will execute it as well in the  following line. Then, we will commit our changes to the database. Think of this as  saving our changes; if we close the connection without the commit, our changes will  be discarded. SQL Commit:  Forgetting to commit changes is a common error of SQL beginners.  If you get to a point where your database doesn't behave as expected  and you can't figure out why, check whether you forgot a commit  somewhere in your code.  Using the database setup script Save our script locally and push it to the repository. Refer to the following  commands in this sequence:  git add db_setup.py  git commit –m "database setup script"  git push origin master  [ 84 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Building an Interactive Crime Map   SSH to your VPS and clone the new repository to your  var www directory using  the following commands:  ssh user@123.456.789.123 cd  var www git clone   cd crimemap  Adding credentials to our setup script Now, we still don't have the credentials that our script relies on. We'll do two things  before using our setup script:     Create the dbconfig.py file with a database and password    Add this file to .gitignore to prevent it from being added to our repository  Create and edit the dbconfig.py file directly on your VPS using nano, as follows:  nano dbconfig.py  Then, type the following using the password you chose when you installed MySQL:  db_user = "root" db_password = " "  Save it by hitting Ctrl + X and entering Y when prompted. Now, use similar nano commands to create, edit, and save .gitignore, which  should contain the following:  dbconfig.py *.pyc  The first line prevents our dbconfig file from being added to our Git repository,  which helps prevent an unauthorized use of our database password. The second  line prevents compiled Python files from being added to the repository as these are  simply runtime optimizations and are relevant to our project. Running our database setup script With this done, you can run: python db_setup.py  Assuming everything goes smoothly, you should now have a database with a  table to store crimes. Python will output any SQL errors, allowing you to debug if  necessary. If you make changes to the script from the server, run the same git add,  git commit, and git push commands that you did from your local machine.  [ 85 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 6   git status:  You can run git status from the terminal  make sure you are  in your repository directory  to see a summary of the files that are  committed. You could use this now  before git push  to make sure  that you didn't commit the dbconfig file.  This concludes our preliminary database setup! Now, we can create a basic Flask  project that uses our database.  Creating a basic database web  application We will start by building a skeleton of our Crime Map application. It'll be a basic  Flask application with a single page that:     Displays all the data in the crimes table of our database    Allows users to input data and stores this data in the database    Has a Clear button that deletes all the previously input data  Although what we will store and display can't really be described as crime data  yet, we'll store it in the crimes table that we created earlier. We'll just use the  description field for now, ignoring all the other ones.  The process of setting up the Flask application is very similar to what we did   before. We will separate out the database logic into a separate file, leaving our   main crimemap.py file for the Flask setup and routing.  Setting up our directory structure On your local machine, change to the crimemap directory. If you created the database  setup script on the server or made any changes to it there, make sure to sync the  changes locally. Then, create the templates directory and touch the files we will use  by running the following commands  or using the GUI file explorer if you prefer :  cd crimemap git pull origin master mkdir templates touch templates home.html touch crimemap.py touch dbhelper.py  [ 86 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Building an Interactive Crime Map   Looking at our application code Add the following code to the crimemap.py file. This contains nothing unexpected  and should all be familiar from our Headlines project. The only thing to point out is  the DBHelper   class, which we'll consider the code for next. We will simply create a  global DBHelper instance right after initializing our application and then use it in the  relevant methods to grab data from the database, insert data into the database,   or delete all data from the database:  from dbhelper import DBHelper from flask import Flask from flask import render_template from flask import request  app = Flask __name__  DB = DBHelper    @app.route " "  def home  :     try:         data = DB.get_all_inputs       except Exception as e:         print e         data = None     return render_template "home.html", data=data   @app.route " add", methods=["POST"]  def add  :   try:     data = request.form.get "userinput"      DB.add_input data    except Exception as e:     print e   return home    @app.route " clear"  def clear  :   try:     DB.clear_all     except Exception as e:     print e   return home      if __name__ == '__main__':   app.run port=5000, debug=True   [ 87 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 6   Looking at our SQL code There's a little bit more SQL to learn from our database helper code. Add the  following code to the dbhelper.py file:  import pymysql import dbconfig  class DBHelper:    def connect self, database="crimemap" :     return pymysql.connect host='localhost',               user=dbconfig.db_user,               passwd=dbconfig.db_password,               db=database     def get_all_inputs self :   connection = self.connect       try:       query = "SELECT description FROM crimes;"       with connection.cursor   as cursor:         cursor.execute query        return cursor.fetchall       finally:       connection.close      def add_input self, data :     connection = self.connect       try:        The following introduces a deliberate security flaw.         See section on SQL injection below       query = "INSERT INTO crimes  description  VALUES          '{}' ;".format data        with connection.cursor   as cursor:         cursor.execute query          connection.commit       finally:       connection.close             def clear_all self :     connection = self.connect       try:       query = "DELETE FROM crimes;"       with connection.cursor   as cursor:         cursor.execute query          connection.commit       finally:       connection.close    [ 88 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Building an Interactive Crime Map   As in our setup script, we need to make a connection with our database and then   get a cursor from our connection in order to do anything meaningful. Again, we will  do all our operations in try: finally: blocks in order to ensure that the connection  is closed.  In our helper, we will consider three of the four main database operations.   CRUD  Create, Read, Update, and Delete  describes the basic database operations.  We will either create and insert new data, read the existing data, modify the existing  data, or delete the existing data. We have no need to update data in our basic app,  but creating, reading, and deleting are certainly useful.  Reading data Let's start with reading, assuming that there is some data already in our database. In  SQL, this is done using the SELECT statement; we will choose which data we want to  retrieve based on a set of conditions. In our case, the query in the get_all_inputs  function is SELECT description FROM crimes;. We'll take a look a bit later at how  to refine a SELECT query, but this one just grabs the description field for every row  in our crimes table. This is similar to the example we talked about at the beginning  of this chapter, in which we wanted to send out a newsletter and needed the e-mail  address of each of our customers. Here, we want the description of each of our crimes.  Once the cursor executes the query, it will point to the beginning of a data structure  containing the results. We will perform fetchall   on our cursor, which transforms  our results set to a list so that we can pass them back to our application code.  If you've  used generators in Python, it may help to think of a database cursor as a generator.   It knows how to iterate over the data but doesn't itself contain all the data .  Inserting data Next up is our add_input   function. This takes the data input by the user and  inserts it into the database. Creating data in SQL is done using the INSERT keyword.  Our query  assuming foobar is our passed in data  is INSERT into crimes   description  VALUES  'foobar' .  This may look overcomplicated for what it actually does, but remember that we're  still dealing with a single field  description . We'll discuss later how INSERT is  designed to accept multiple but arbitrary columns, which can all be named in the  first set of brackets, and then matching values for each of these, which are given in  the second set of brackets, after VALUES. As we made changes to the database, we will need to commit our connection to make  these permanent.  [ 89 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 6   Deleting data Finally, we will take a look at how concise a DELETE statement in SQL can be. DELETE  FROM crimes wipes all the data from our crimes database. We'll consider later how  to make this keyword behave less like a nuke by specifying conditions to delete only  some data.  Again, this makes changes to our database, so we need to commit these.  If all the new SQL commands seem to be a lot to take in, go play around with them  for a bit in an online sandbox or even in our own live SQL shell that we discussed  how to access earlier. You'll find that SQL comes quite naturally after a while as most  of its keywords are taken from a natural language, and it uses very few symbols.  Finally, let's take a look at our HTML template.  Creating our view code Python and SQL are fun to write, and they are indeed the main part of our application.  However, at the moment, we have a house without doors or windows; the difficult  and impressive bit is done, but it's unusable. Let's add a few lines of HTML to allow  the world to interact without the code we wrote.  In templates home.html, add the following:               Crime Map          Crime Map                           clear    {% for userinput in data %}      {{userinput}}      {% endfor %}      [ 90 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Building an Interactive Crime Map   There's nothing we haven't seen before. Here, we had a form with a single text input  to add data to our database by calling the  add function of our app, and directly  below it, we looped through all the existing data and displayed each piece within    tags.  Running the code on our VPS Finally, we need to make our code accessible to the world. This means pushing it to  our git repo, pulling it onto the VPS, and configuring Apache to serve it. Run the  following commands locally:  git add .  git commit –m "Skeleton CrimeMap"  git push origin master  ssh  @   Now, on your VPS, run the following:  cd  var www crimemap  git pull origin master  Now, we need a .wsgi file to link Python to Apache, which can be created by  running the following command:  nano crimemap.wsgi  The .wsgi file should contain the following:  import sys sys.path.insert 0, " var www crimemap"  from crimemap import app as application  Now, hit Ctrl + X and then enter Y when prompted to save. We also need to create a new Apache .conf file, and to set this as the default   instead of headlines, the .conf file that is our current default . Run the following  commands to create the file:  cd  etc apache2 sites-available  nano crimemap.conf  Next, add the following code:        ServerName example.com      WSGIScriptAlias    var www crimemap crimemap.wsgi  [ 91 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 6       WSGIDaemonProcess crimemap              WSGIProcessGroup crimemap        WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}         Order deny,allow         Allow from all          This is so similar to the headlines.conf file we created for our previous project that  you might find it easier to just copy the previous one and substitute as necessary.  Finally, we need to deactivate the old site and activate the new one, as follows:  sudo a2dissite headlines.conf  sudo a2ensite crimemap.conf  sudo service apache2 reload  Now, everything should be working. If you copied the code out manually, it's almost  certain that there's a bug or two to deal with. Don't be discouraged by this; remember  that debugging is expected to be a large part of development! If necessary, run tail  –f  var log apache2 error.log while you load the site to note any errors. If this  fails, add some print statements to crimemap.py and dbhelper.py to narrow down  where things are breaking.  Once everything works, you should be able to see a web page with a single text input.  When you submit text through the input, you should see the text displayed on the  page, as in the example that follows:  [ 92 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Building an Interactive Crime Map   Note how the data we get from the database is a tuple, so it is surrounded by  brackets and has a trailing comma. This is because we selected only a single field,  'description', from our crimes table, while we could, in theory, be dealing with  many columns for each crime  and soon we will do so .  Mitigating against SQL injection Our application contains a fatal flaw. We take input from our users and insert it into  our SQL statements using Python string formatting. This works well when the user  enters a normal alphanumeric string as expected, but if the user is malicious, they  can actually inject their own SQL code and take control of our database. Although  SQL injection is an old attack and most modern technology automatically mitigates  against it, there are still dozens of attacks against major corporations every year in  which passwords or financial data are leaked due to a SQL injection vulnerability.  We'll take a moment to discuss what an SQL injection is and how to prevent it.  Injecting SQL into our database application Navigate to our web application and hit the clear link to remove any saved inputs.  Now, in the input, type Bobby and click on the Submit button. The page should now  look similar to the following image:  [ 93 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 6   In this input, now type:  ' ; DELETE FROM crimes; --  All characters are important here.  The input needs to start with a single quote followed by a close bracket, followed by a  semicolon, and then followed by the delete statement, another semicolon, a space, and  finally two hyphens. You might expect to see a second line when the page refreshes,  listing this strange-looking string beneath the Bobby output, but instead, you'll see a  blank page that looks similar to the screenshot that follows:  This is weird, right? Let's take a look at what happened. In our DBHelper class,   our insert statements have the following line:  query = "INSERT INTO crimes  description  VALUES    '{}' ;".format data   This means that the user's input gets added into the SQL code just before we run the  code on the database. When we put the strange-looking input that we used previously  into the placeholder of the SQL statement, we will get the following string:  "INSERT INTO crimes  description  VALUES  '' ; DELETE FROM crimes; --  ' ;"  These are two SQL statements instead of one. We closed off the INSERT statement  with an empty value and then deleted everything in the crimes table with the  DELETE statement. The two hyphens at the end form an SQL comment so that the  extra close quotation mark and bracket don't cause any syntax errors. When we input  our data, we inserted a blank row into our database and then deleted all the data  from the crimes table!  [ 94 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Building an Interactive Crime Map   Of course, a creative attacker could run any SQL statement in place of the DELETE  statement that we chose. They could drop an entire table  refer to https:  xkcd. com 327  for a humorous example , or they could run a select statement to bypass a  database login function. Alternatively, if you store credit card information, a similar  attack could be used to fetch the data and display it to the attacker. In general, we don't  want the users of our web application to be able to run arbitrary code on our database!  Mitigating against SQL injection Mitigating against SQL injection involves sanitizing user inputs and making  sure that if the user inputs special characters that might be interpreted as SQL  syntax, these characters are ignored. There are different ways to do this, and we'll  use a simple one provided automatically by our Python SQL library. For more  comprehensive information on this topic, take a look at https:  www.owasp.org  index.php SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.  In the dbhelper.py file, change the add_input   method to read as follows:  def add_input self, data :     connection = self.connect     try:       query = "INSERT INTO crimes  description  VALUES  %s ;"       with connection.cursor   as cursor:           cursor.execute query, data            connection.commit         finally:           connection.close    The %s token that we used here is a string placeholder similar to %d, which is used in  normal Python strings as a placeholder and an older alternative to braces. However,  instead of using Python's str.format   function, we will pass the string and values  that we want to insert into the placeholders to the PyMySQL cursor.execute    function. This will now automatically escape all characters that are meaningful to  SQL so that we don't have to worry about them being executed.  [ 95 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 6   Now, if you try the inputs again, you'll see them displayed as expected-special  characters and all-as in the screenshot that follows:  In the final chapter of this book, we'll briefly talk about ORM techniques that can  provide even stronger mitigation against SQL injection attacks. While it might seem  to be a simple problem that we've solved by escaping some special characters, it can  actually become quite subtle. Tools such as sqlmap  http:  sqlmap.org   can try  hundreds of different variants on the same idea  that is, the idea of inputting special  characters against a database  until one gets unexpected results and a vulnerability is  found. Remember that for your application to be secure, it has to be protected against  every possible vulnerability; for it to be insecure, it only has to be vulnerable to one.  Summary That's it for the introduction to our Crime Map project. We discussed how to  install a MySQL database on our VPS and how to hook it up to Flask. We looked at  creating, reading, updating, and deleting data, and we created a basic database web  application that can accept user input and display it back again. We finished off by  looking at the SQL injection vulnerability and how to protect ourselves against it.  Next up, we'll add a Google Maps widget and some better aesthetics.  [ 96 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Building an Interactive Crime Map   Adding Google Maps to Our  Crime Map Project  In the previous chapter, we set up a database and discussed how to add and remove  data from it through Flask. With a web application that can do input and output  with long-term storage, we now have the building blocks needed for nearly all web  applications and are limited only by the power of our imagination.  In this chapter, we will add more features than the text-only interface from the  previous chapter; we'll add embedded Google Maps that will allow a user to view  and select geographic coordinates in an intuitive way.   Google Maps is written in JavaScript, and we'll need to write some JavaScript  code to adapt Google Maps to our needs. As always, we'll do a whirlwind tutorial  for readers who haven't ever used JavaScript before, but if you're interested in  solidifying your all-inclusive web application knowledge, now is a good time to  quickly go through a couple of JavaScript-specific tutorials. If you've never seen any  JavaScript code before, an easy introduction that is similar to the HTML and CSS  tutorials we provided links to before can be found at http:  www.w3schools.com  js default.asp.  Arguably, the most important part of a crime map is the map itself. We'll use the  Google Maps API, which is simple and powerful for developers and intuitive for  users. As a first step, we'll just add a basic map that loads to an area and zoom level  that we choose. Once we've seen to this, we'll add functionality to allow for markers.  Markers will serve two purposes for our map: first, we'll display a marker on the  map in the location of every crime we have saved in our database; second, when the  user clicks on the map, it'll add a new marker and allow the user to submit a new  crime report  eventually by adding a description and date in form fields .  [ 97 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   However, first we need to be able to run our application locally again for development  and debugging. Having linked it to the database, this is a bit tricky; so, we'll look at  how to solve this common problem.  In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:     Running a database application locally    Adding an embedded Google Map widget to our application    Adding an input form for new crimes    Displaying existing crimes on our map  Running a database application locally In order to develop and debug locally, we need to be able to run the application.  However, at the moment, this is not possible as MySQL is only installed on our   VPS. There are three main options to develop our database application locally:     Connecting to the database on our VPS even when running Flask on our    local machine Installing MySQL on our local machine        Creating a "mock" of our database in memory using Python  While any could work, we'll go with the third option. Connecting to our production  database would cause us to be affected by latency if we develop in a location  far from our VPS, and this would also mean that we'd run test code against our  production database, which is never a good idea. The second option would limit the  portability of our development environment, increase setup time if we switch to a  new development environment, and in the worst case scenario, use up a significant  amount of local resources.  Creating a mock of our database If you try to run the crimemap.py file locally, the first error you will see is  ImportError because of the dbconfig.py file that we don't have. In the previous  chapter, we created this file directly on our VPS and didn't check it into git as it  contained sensitive database credentials. We'll create a local copy of dbconfig.py,  which indicates that our application should use a mock database. We'll update the  dbconfig.py file on our VPS to indicate that the real database should be used when  the app is run from there. We'll do this with a simple Boolean flag.  [ 98 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Adding Google Maps to Our Crime Map Project   Adding a test flag In your local crimemap directory, create a new dbconfig.py file and add a single  line of code:  test = True  Now, SSH into your VPS and add the flag to the production configuration as well;  although, here, the value should be set to False, as follows:  ssh user@123.456.789.123  cd  var www crimemap  nano dbconfig.py  Add the following to the top of the file:  test = False  Then, type Ctrl + X followed by Y to save and quit the file Now, exit the SSH session. This will solve ImportError  the dbconfig.py file now  exists on our VPS and locally , and our application is now aware of whether it is  running in test or production.  Writing the mock code Our flag doesn't actually do anything yet though, and we don't want to trigger all the  exceptions when we test our app. Instead, we'll write a "mock" of our database code   the code in the dbhelper.py file  that'll return basic static data or None. When our  application runs, it will be able to call database functions normally, but there will be  no actual database. Instead, we'll have a few lines of Python to emulate a very basic  database. Create the mockdbhelper.py file in your crimemap directory and add the  following code:  class MockDBHelper:    def connect self, database="crimemap" :     pass    def get_all_inputs self :     return []    def add_input self, data :     pass    def clear_all self :     pass  [ 99 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 7   As you can note, the methods we used for our basic database application all exist but  don't do anything. The get_all_inputs   method returns an empty list, which we  can still pass to our template. Now, we just need to tell our app to use this instead of  the real DBHelper class if we are in a testing environment. Add the following code to  the end of the imports section in crimemap.py, making sure to remove the existing  import for DBHelper:  import dbconfig if dbconfig.test:     from mockdbhelper import MockDBHelper as DBHelper else:     from dbhelper import DBHelper  We use our test flag in dbconfig to specify whether or not to import the real  DBHelper  which relies on having a connection to MySQL  or to import the mock  DBHelper  which does not need database connection . If we import the mock helper,  we can change the name so that the rest of the code can continue to run without  conditional checks for the test flag.  Validating our expectations Now, you should be able to run the code locally, just as before we added a database  dependency. In your terminal, run:  python crimemap.py  Then, visit localhost:5000 in your browser to take a look at your app loading. Check  the output of the terminal to make sure that no exceptions are triggered  as would  be the case if you attempted to run the real DBHelper code instead of the mock ones  we just made . Although our application no longer "works", we can at least run it to  test our code that doesn't involve the database. Then, when we deploy to production,  everything should work exactly as in our tests, but with a real database plugged in.  Adding an embedded Google Maps  widget to our application Now, we want to add a map view to our app instead of the basic input box. Google  Maps allows you to create a map without registration, but you will only be able to  make a limited number of API calls. If you create this project, publish a link on the  Web, and it goes viral, you stand a chance of hitting the limit  which is currently  2,500 map loads per day . If you think this will be a limiting factor, you can register  for the maps API and have the option of paying Google for more capacity. However,  the free version will be more than adequate for development and even production if  your app isn't too popular.  [ 100 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Adding Google Maps to Our Crime Map Project   Adding the map to our template We want to display a map on the main page of our app, so this means editing the  code in the home.html file in our templates directory. Remove all the existing code  and replace it with the following:              <script type="text javascript"       src="https:  maps.googleapis.com maps api js">                    function initialize   {          var mapOptions = {           center: new google.maps.LatLng -             33.30578381949298, 26.523442268371582 ,           zoom: 15         };         var map = new         google.maps.Map document.getElementById "map-             canvas" ,mapOptions ;       }                        <div id="map-canvas" style="width:80%;         height:500px;">           Introducing JavaScript Let's take a look at what happened here. The first line told our user's browser that  we're using HTML5. Lines 4 to 6 include the map resources we need in our page.  Note that this is between   tags, indicating that it's JavaScript. In this  particular case, we did not actually write the JavaScript code – we simply linked  to where it's hosted on Google's servers. Think of this a bit as a Python import  statement, except we don't even have to install the package locally; it's simply  "imported" at runtime by your user's browser.  [ 101 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 7   Directly following this is our setup script to display a basic map. Again, this is  between   tags to indicate that it's JavaScript instead of HTML. This time,  we actually wrote the JavaScript code ourselves though. The syntax is similar to Java  in terms of brackets, braces, and for loops. Apart from this and its name, there is  little relation between it and Java.  The first line of our JavaScript code is a function definition; similar to Python's "def"  we use the function keyword to define a new function named initialise  . We  declared a variable with var mapOptions = and assigned a new JavaScript object  to this variable that looks similar to a Python dictionary. We define a location with  a latitude-longitude tuple-like object, which we have access to because of Lines 4 to  6, and the object also contains a "zoom" level. These options describe our initial map:  which area should be displayed and at what zoom level.  Finally, we created a new variable, map, and initialized a Google map object, passing  in the ID of an HTML element  which we'll explain in more detail in the following  section  and the map options we just defined. We then reached the end of our  JavaScript code, so we closed the   tag.  The body of our HTML code Although our   section is only a couple of lines, it has some subtleties. The first  line opens the   tag and also defines the onload parameter. This parameter  takes the name of a JavaScript function that will be called automatically when the  page is loaded. Note that the function name  "initialize", in our case, as this is  the function we just wrote and want to be run automatically in order to create our  map  is enclosed in inverted commas. This might be counterintuitive if you think  of Python, in which inverted commas are used mainly for string literals. Think of it  as passing the function name to the body block but note the fact that we still use the  open-close brackets as part of the name.  The next line creates a   element. Normally,   does nothing except enclose  more HTML, but this doesn't mean that an empty   block, as we have here, is  pointless. Note the ID, map-canvas, that we give our  . This matches the name  in our JavaScript code; that is, the JavaScript function will look for an HTML element  called map-canvas  using document.getElementById    and transform this into  Google Maps widget. Therefore, it makes sense to use a   element as we want  an empty element for our JavaScript code to use.  [ 102 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Adding Google Maps to Our Crime Map Project   Finally, our   element also includes some inline CSS. We can define the width  and height of our map  which is a requirement of the Google Maps API  using  CSS's height and width attributes. In this case, we defined the map to a constant  height value of 500 pixels and a width value of 80% of the page. The percentage for  the width is useful as the scrolling functionality is often overloaded with the zoom  functionality. That is, if the user wants to scroll down on our page using a touchpad  or mouse wheel and his or her cursor is over the map, the map will zoom in instead  of the page scrolling down. The 20 percent "blank" space on the right-hand side,  therefore, provides the user with somewhere to move the mouse to while scrolling.  Similarly, for touchscreens, the user would "pan" around the map while trying to  scroll, but can use this space to put his or her finger while scrolling.  Testing and debugging We should now be able to run our web app locally and see the embedded Google  Map. If your app is not already running, use your terminal to start it up again and  navigate to localhost:5000 in your browser. As we don't store the code for Google  Maps locally, this needs to be fetched from Google's servers, so we need our local  machine to be online for this to work  similar to fetching the data we needed for our  Headlines application .  Debugging JavaScript code is a bit tricky as any errors won't be registered by Flask  and will therefore not be seen in your app output. If your web page is blank or does  anything unexpected, the first place to look is your browser's developer console.  This is a developer's tool that can be found in all the major browsers, normally  by pressing Ctrl + Shift + C and navigating to the "Console" tab in the window or  sidebar that appears. Here, you'll note any JavaScript errors or warnings that your  code has triggered, so this tool is invaluable in debugging a web application.  Although the console should report line numbers along with errors, it can sometimes  be difficult to track down exactly what is going wrong. JavaScript is a dynamically  typed language and is infamous for having some pretty quirky and counterintuitive  behavior. If necessary, you can also add JavaScript lines between the   tags  in your HTML that do nothing but log in to the developer tools console. To do this,  use the following:  console.log "A message" ;  This is similar to a Python print statement, and you can pass variables and most  objects to see a string representation of them logged to the output. Use the + symbol  to concatenate. For example, if you have a variable named "a" and you want to see its  value at a specific point in code, you could add the following line:  console.log "The value of a is: " + a ;  [ 103 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 7   For a more sophisticated approach to debugging, take a look at the Debugger tab  of the developer tools window  or its equivalent in your browser  and play around  with setting breakpoints in JavaScript. The developer tools are generally a powerful  suite of tools and their full functionality is unfortunately beyond the scope of this  book. The following screenshot shows the Mozilla Firefox developer console with a  breakpoint set just before the map loads:  Once all the bugs are squashed  or straight-away if you are meticulous and lucky , you  should see a page in your browser containing an embedded Google Map centered on  Grahamstown, South Africa. Play around with the zoom level and coordinates set by  the mapOptions variable in your JavaScript code to get the initial map of your choice.  Clicking and holding on the map will allow "panning" or moving around the world.  Zooming is done by scrolling with your middle mouse wheel, using your touchpad,  or "pinch zooming" on touchscreen. The result should look similar to the following  screenshot:  [ 104 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Adding Google Maps to Our Crime Map Project   Let's now move on to making our map more interactive and useful.  Making our map interactive The first functionality we'll add to our app will allow the user to place a marker  on the map. This will eventually allow the user to add a crime report by indicating  where the crime took place, thus adding to our crowd-sourced database of crimes.  We'll implement the marker functionality in JavaScript, as well, using a "listener".  Adding markers JavaScript is event-driven. Actions such as a mouse move or mouse click are events,  and we can react to these events by setting up an event listener. The listener simply  runs in the background, waiting for a specific event, and then triggers a specified  action if it detects the event. We'll set up a listener for a mouse click, and if detected,  we'll place a map marker at the location of the mouse when clicked.  Using the Google Map API, this can be achieved in a few lines of code. First, we'll  make our map variable global. Then, we'll create a placeMarker   function that  will reference our map variable and place a marker on it when called. In our existing  initalise   function, we'll add a click listener that will call the placeMarker    function when triggered.  [ 105 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 7   The full JavaScript code can be seen here with the modified lines highlighted:  <script type="text javascript"   src="https:  maps.googleapis.com maps api js">           var map;   function initialize   {    var mapOptions = {     center: new google.maps.LatLng -33.30578381949298,         26.523442268371582 ,     zoom: 15   };   map = new google.maps.Map document.getElementById "map-       canvas" , mapOptions ;   google.maps.event.addListener map, 'click',       function event {        placeMarker event.latLng ;     } ;   }    function placeMarker location  {   var marker = new google.maps.Marker {     position: location,      map: map   } ;   }    Note specifically the change from var map = new google.maps.Map to map = new  google.maps.Map. We removed the var declaration, which means that we assigned  our new map to our global map variable instead of creating a new local variable.  The next line makes a call to addListener  , which might look a little odd. The  addListener   function takes a map, event, and function to be called when the  listener is triggered. As in Python, JavaScript has first-class functions, which means  that we can pass functions as arguments to other functions. Unlike Python, we don't  need to use the lambda keyword to create an anonymous function; we can simply  declare the function we want to pass in place of the argument. In this case, we  created an anonymous function that takes an event argument and in turn calls our  placeMarker   function, passing it the latLng property of event. In our case, event  is the mouse click that is picked up by the listener, and the latLng property is the  location of the mouse click.  [ 106 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Adding Google Maps to Our Crime Map Project   In our placeMarker   function, we accepted a location and created a new Marker  object, placing it at the passed-in location on our map  this is why we made the map  global; now we can refer to it in this new function .  In summary, when the page loads, we will add a listener that hangs around in  the background, waiting for a click. When a click is detected, the listener makes  a call to placeMarker  , passing in the coordinates of the click it detected. The  placeMarker   function then adds a marker at the specified coordinates, meaning  that the user sees a marker appear on the map as he or she clicks on the map. Give  it a try, using the console and debugger in your browser, as we did before, if things  don't go as expected. You should see a new marker placed on the map for every click  and be able to generate maps that look similar to the following screenshot:  Using a single marker Creating a new marker for every click is not ideal. We actually want the user to be  able to move the marker with each click instead of creating a new one. Adding more  than one crime at a time would be overcomplicated and not overly useful.  [ 107 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 7   To achieve this, create another global marker variable under the existing global map  variable. Then, add a simple condition to the placeMarker   function that creates   a new marker only if there isn't one already and moves the location of the existing  one otherwise.  The full code, again with the modified lines highlighted, is shown as follows. Again,  note that we removed var from the line where we created a new marker variable, thus  using the global variable instead of creating a local one. With these changes, each click  on the map should move the marker instead of creating a new one. Try it out:  <script type="text javascript"   src="https:  maps.googleapis.com maps api js">           var map;   var marker;   function initialize   {      var mapOptions = {     center: new google.maps.LatLng -33.30578381949298,        26.523442268371582 ,     zoom: 15     };     map = new google.maps.Map document.getElementById "map-        canvas" , mapOptions ;     google.maps.event.addListener map, 'click',        function event {         placeMarker event.latLng ;     } ;   }    function placeMarker location  {     if  marker  {       marker.setPosition location ;     } else {      marker = new google.maps.Marker {        position: location,        map: map      } ;     }   }    [ 108 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Adding Google Maps to Our Crime Map Project   Adding an input form for new crimes We want the user to be able to specify more information than simply a location.   The next step is to create a form that the user can use to add date, category, and  description data to a crime submission. Each of these pieces of information will be  stored in the database columns we created in the previous chapter. Creating web  forms is a common enough task that there are many frameworks and plugins to help  automate as much of the process as possible, as most forms need a pretty frontend,  which includes error messages if the user puts in unexpected input, as well as backend  logic to process the data and do a more thorough validation to prevent malformed or  incorrect data from polluting the database.  However, in the spirit of learning, we'll now create the backend and frontend of a  web form from scratch. In our next project, we'll take a look at how to do something  similar using various tools to make the process less laborious.  Our goal is to have a number of input fields to the right of our map, which allows   the user to specify details about a witnessed or experienced crime and submit it to   be included with our existing data. The form should have the following inputs:     Category: A drop-down menu that allows the user to select which category      Date: A calendar that allows the user to easily enter the date and time of       Description: A larger text box that allows the user to describe the crime in   the crime falls into  the crime  free-form text     Latitude and Longitude: Text boxes that are automatically populated based   on the location selected using the marker  After filling the preceding fields, the user should be able to click on a Submit button  and view the crime he or she just submitted appear on the map.  The HTML code for the form The HTML code needed for our form is very similar to the forms created in our  earlier project, but it has some new elements as well, namely   and    and an input with type= "date". The   element is very  similar to the standard text fields we noted before but appears as a larger square to  encourage the user to enter more text. Label elements can define a for attribute to  specify what we are labeling. The text between the opening and closing label tags is  then shown close to the element to be labeled.   [ 109 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 7   This is useful for our form as we can prompt the user about what data to enter in  each field. The date field will provide a nice calendar drop-down menu to select a  date. Unfortunately, it's a fairly recent addition to HTML and is not supported in   all browsers. In unsupported browsers  including Firefox , this will be identical   to a text input, so we'll look at how to handle dates input by the user at the end   of this chapter.  Also, note that we put the form inside a   element to make it easier to style and  position on the page  we'll also do this later . The full   element of our HTML  page now looks as follows  note that we added a heading and paragraph above the  map, while the form is added below the map . Take a look at the following code:       CrimeMap     A map of recent criminal activity in the      Grahamstown area.    <div id="map-canvas" style="width:70%;      height:500px">           Submit new crime            Category              Mugging        Break-in             Date             Latitude      <input name="latitude" id="latitude"        type="text">      Longitude      <input name="longitude" id="longitude"        type="text">      Description      <textarea name="description" id="description"          placeholder="A brief but detailed         description of the crime">                      [ 110 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Adding Google Maps to Our Crime Map Project   Refresh your page to see the form below the map. You'll notice that it looks pretty  terrible with different-sized fields and a horizontal layout, as in the following  screenshot:  Let's add some CSS to fix this.  Adding external CSS to our web application To make the form appear to the right of our map, we'll use CSS. We already have some  CSS for our map, and we could add more CSS in a similar way. However, refer to  our discussion of inline, internal, and external CSS from Chapter 5, Improving the User  Experience of Our Headlines Project, in the Adding CSS to our Headlines application section,  and remember that having all CSS in a separate file is best practice. Therefore, we'll  create a style.css file and consider how to link it to our Flask app.  [ 111 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 7   Creating the CSS file in our directory structure By default in Flask, our static files should be kept in a directory called static. We'll  want to keep various kinds of files in here eventually, such as images, JavaScript, and  CSS, so we'll create a subdirectory called CSS and create our style.css file inside  this. Navigate to your project directory in your terminal and run the following to add  this directory structure and file to our project:  mkdir –p static css  touch static css style.css  Adding CSS code Insert the following CSS code into this new file:  body {  font-family: sans-serif;  background: eee; }  input, select, textarea {  display: block;  color: grey;  border: 1px solid lightsteelblue;  line-height: 15px;  margin: 2px 6px 16px 0px;  width: 100%; }  input[type="submit"] {  padding: 5px 10px 5px 10px;  color: black;  background: lightsteelblue;  border: none;  box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px 4C6E91; }  input[type="submit"]:hover {  background: steelblue; }  map-canvas {  width: 70%;  height: 500px;  float: left;  [ 112 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Adding Google Maps to Our Crime Map Project   }  newcrimeform {  float: right;  width: 25%; }  You'll probably notice the similarities with the CSS code that we used for our  Headlines project. However, there are still some important points to note:     We defined the width and height of any element with the ID of map-canvas   here  in the second-last block , so we can remove the inline style from our  body.html file.     We used CSS's float functionality to display our form to the right of our   map instead of below it. The map takes up 70% of the width of the page,   and the form takes up 25%  with the last 5% left so that the map and form  have some space between them. Our map floats to the left of the page, while  the form floats to the right. Because they take up less than 100% of the width  combined, they'll be displayed side by side in the browser.   Configuring Flask to use CSS Normally in HTML pages, we can link to external CSS files simply by giving a  relative path to the stylesheet. As we're using Flask, we need to configure our  application to return the CSS file as a static one. By default, Flask serves files from  a directory named static in the route of the project, which is why it's important to  place the CSS file here, as described earlier. Flask can generate a URL for the CSS file  we need to link to using the url_for function. In the home.html template, add the  following line to the top of the   section:  <link type="text css" rel="stylesheet" href="{{url_for 'static',     filename='css style.css'  }}"  >  This creates a link between our HTML and CSS. We used attributes to describe the  link as being to a text css file and that it is a stylesheet. We then gave its location  with href using the url_for   function.  We also need to add a line of JavaScript code to populate the location input  automatically whenever the marker on the map is created or moved. This is achieved  by adding the lines highlighted in the following to the placeMarker   function:  function placeMarker location  {  if  marker  {   marker.setPosition location ;  } else {  [ 113 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 7     marker = new google.maps.Marker {    position: location,    map: map   } ;  }  document.getElementById 'latitude' .value = location.lat  ;  document.getElementById 'longitude' .value = location.lng  ; }  These lines simply find the latitude and longitude boxes  identified by their id  attribute  and insert the location used to place the marker. When we POST the form   to the server, we'll be able to read these values on the backend.  Finally, remove the inline CSS that we added earlier as this functionality is now  the responsibility of our external stylesheet. Take a look at the following line in the  home.html file:      The preceding line can be modified to instead be as follows:      Viewing the result Reload the page in your browser to view the result. Remember that CSS and  JavaScript are often cached by your browser, so hit Ctrl + R for a hard refresh if you  see unexpected behavior. If Ctrl + R does not work, try hitting Ctrl + Shift + Delete  and select the cache option in the browser's menu and clear the browsing data before  refreshing again.  The styled map with the form should look similar to the following screenshot:  [ 114 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Adding Google Maps to Our Crime Map Project   Note that clicking on the map now populates the latitude and longitude boxes with  the coordinates of the marker.  Publishing the result We have the form, the map, and some CSS, so now is a good time to push the result  to our VPS so that we can see what it looks like on different devices or ask people   for feedback.  To push our changes, fire up a terminal, change the directory to the root folder,   and run the following:  git add crimemap.py  git add templates home.html  git add static  git commit –m "Map with form and CSS"  git push origin master  [ 115 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 7   Then, SSH into your VPS and pull the new code by running the following:  cd  var www crimemap  git pull origin master  sudo service apache2 reload  Visit the IP of your VPS to check whether the page worked and looks right. As usual,  look at  var log apache2 error.log if anything unexpected happens.  Linking the form to the backend It's all very well to have a pretty form to accept user input, but at the moment, we're  just throwing away any submitted data. Instead of processing input in real time, as  we did in our headlines application, we want to capture the input and store it in our  database. Let's take a look at how to achieve this.  Setting up the URL to collect POST data As in our Headlines project, the first step is to set up a URL on our server to   which the data can be posted. In the HTML form we created, we set this URL   to be  submitcrime, so let's create this as a route in our Flask app. In crimemap.py,  add the following function:  @app.route " submitcrime", methods=['POST']  def submitcrime  :  category = request.form.get "category"   date = request.form.get "date"   latitude = float request.form.get "latitude"    longitude = float request.form.get "longitude"    description = request.form.get "description"   DB.add_crime category, date, latitude, longitude, description   return home    Here, we simply grabbed all the data the user entered and passed it to our database  helper. We used the DB.add_crime   function in the preceding code, but this does  not yet exist. We need it to really add the new data to our database for our real  DBHelper, and we also need a stub of this function for MockDBHelper. Let's take a  look at how to add these.  [ 116 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Adding Google Maps to Our Crime Map Project   Adding the database methods In MockDBHelper.py, the function is simple. It needs to take the same arguments   and then not do anything. Add the following to mockdbhelper.py:  def add_crime self, category, date, latitude, longitude,     description :   pass  The real function needs to be added to dbhelper.py and is a bit more involved.   It looks:  def add_crime self, category, date, latitude, longitude,     description :   connection = self.connect     try:     query = "INSERT INTO crimes  category, date, latitude,         longitude, description  \       VALUES  %s, %s, %s, %s, %s "     with connection.cursor   as cursor:       cursor.execute query,  category, date, latitude, longitude,  description         connection.commit     except Exception as e:     print e    finally:     connection.close    There is nothing we haven't seen before here. We used placeholder values and only  populated them within the cursor.execute   statement to avoid SQL injection, and  we closed our connection in a finally block to make sure it always happens.  Testing the code on the server Here is another good point to commit all the changes to the repository and do a  quick check for bugs. Once the new code runs on your VPS, try adding a crime to  the database by visiting your IP address and filling in the form we made. On your  VPS, you can check to make sure the data was successfully added by running the  following commands. Note that this fires up a live SQL shell—a direct connection  to your database that should be used with care. A mistyped command can result in  data being irretrievably lost or corrupted. Run the following:  mysql –p     use database crimemap  select * from crimes;  [ 117 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 7   You'll see that MySQL prints a nice ASCII table that shows a summary of the data  in your database, as in the following screenshot  in this case, all the records and  columns from the crimes table of the crimemap database are shown :  Displaying existing crimes on our map Now, the user can add new crimes to our crime database, but we want the map to  display crimes that are already added as well. To achieve this, whenever the page is  loaded, our app needs to make a call to the database to get the latest crime data. We  then need to pass this data to our template file, loop through each crime, and place a  marker in the correct place on the map.  Now, our data is stored in a MySQL database. We will access it using Python on  the server side, and we want to display it using JavaScript on the client side; so,  we'll need to spend a bit of time on converting our data to the appropriate format.  When we access the data through our Python pymysql driver, we will receive it as  a tuple. To display the data using JavaScript, we want it in JSON. JSON, you might  remember from our Headlines project, is JavaScript Object Notation, a structured  data format that JavaScript can easily read and manipulate. As with our previous  project, we'll take advantage of the fact that Python dictionaries are very similar to  JSON. We'll create a Python dictionary from the tuple we get out of our database,  convert this to a JSON string, and pass it to our template, which will use JavaScript  to display the data as markers on our map.  Getting data from SQL We'll start in our DBHelper class—adding a method to return the fields we need for  each crime in our database. Add the following method to your dbhelper.py file:  def get_all_crimes self :  connection = self.connect    try:   query = "SELECT latitude, longitude, date, category,      description FROM crimes;"   with connection.cursor   as cursor:    cursor.execute query    named_crimes = []  [ 118 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Adding Google Maps to Our Crime Map Project     for crime in cursor:    named_crime = {     'latitude': crime[0],     'longitude': crime[1],     'date': datetime.datetime.strftime crime[2], '%Y-         %m-%d' ,     'category': crime[3],     'description': crime[4]    }    named_crimes.append named_crime    return named_crimes  finally:   connection.close    Also, add the new import we need for the datetime module to the top of dbhelper. py via the following:  import datetime  We ignored the id and updated_at fields as the user is not interested in these using  the SELECT operator to choose all our other fields. As we have no WHERE clause,  this query will return all the crimes we have in our database. Once we have all the  crimes, we could simply return them in their default representation of a tuple of  tuples. However, this makes the maintenance of our application difficult. We don't  want to have to remember that latitude is the first element of our tuple, longitude  is the second, and so on. This would make developing the JavaScript part of our  application a pain, as we'd have to keep referring back to our DBHelper to find  out how exactly to grab, for example, just the category element of our data. If we  wanted to make changes to our application in the future, it would probably require  the same changes to be made here and in our JavaScript code.  Instead, we will create a dictionary from each of our records and return the  dictionaries. This has two advantages: firstly, it's much easier to develop as we can  refer to the elements of our data by name instead of by index, and secondly, we can  easily convert our dictionary to JSON to be used in our JavaScript code. For most of the  items in our dictionary, we will simply use the database column name as a key and the  data itself as the value. The exception is the date; our database driver returns this as a  Python datetime object, but we want to display it as a string for our user, so we will  format it as "yyyy-mm-dd" before storing it in our dictionary.  We can add a stub of this method to our MockDBHelper so that we can continue to  run our code locally without a database. In this case, instead of just returning a blank  list, we'll return a mock crime, as well, in the same format that we'd expect from  our real DBHelper. It's good practice to make any mock classes you create behave  similarly to their real equivalents as this can help catch development errors while  we're still testing locally.  [ 119 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 7   Add the following function to mockdbhelper.py:  def get_all_crimes self :  return [{ 'latitude': -33.301304,     'longitude': 26.523355,     'date': "2000-01-01",     'category': "mugging",     'description': "mock description" }]  Passing the data to our template Now that we have the ability to retrieve the data we want from our database by  calling a single function, let's look at how we will use it in our main Flask app and  pass it on to our template file.  Every time a user visits our home page, we want to get the crime data from the  database and pass it to the template in JSON format to be displayed using JavaScript  in our user's browser. As most of the hard work is done in our DBHelper class, we  can keep our home   function quite neat. The entire function looks as follows:  @app.route " "  def home  :  crimes = DB.get_all_crimes    crimes = json.dumps crimes   return render_template "home.html", crimes=crimes   We will use the json.dumps   function, which is the opposite of json.loads   that  we used in the first project to create a JSON string for our dictionary  the letter "s" in  dumps stands for "string"  and then pass the JSON string on to our template so that it  can use it to populate the map.  We also need to add an import for the JSON library. Near the top of crimemap.py,  add the following line:  import json  Using the data in our template Our template now has access to a JSON-formatted list of all the crimes in our database,  and we can use this list to display markers on the map—one for each existing crime.  We want to use the location data to choose where to place the marker, and then we  want to embed category, date, and description as a label for our marker. This  means that when the user moves his or her mouse over one of the markers, the  information about the crime represented by this marker will be displayed.  [ 120 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Adding Google Maps to Our Crime Map Project   We need to add a new function to our JavaScript code in our home.html file.   Under the initialize   function, add the following:  function placeCrimes crimes  {  for  i=0; i<crimes.length; i++  {   crime = new google.maps.Marker  {    position: new google.maps.LatLng crimes[i].latitude, crimes[i]. longitude ,    map: map,    title: crimes[i].date + "\n" +      crimes[i].category + "\n" + crimes[i].description    }    ;  } }  This function takes crimes an argument, loops through it, and creates a new marker  on our map  which we can refer to now as we previously made it a global variable   for each crime in the list. We used the call to google.maps.Marker   to create the  marker and pass in a dictionary of arguments  in this case, a google.maps.LatLng    "position", which we construct from our latitude and longitude parameters ; a  reference to our map, which is map; and a concatenation of our date, category, and  description, separated by new line characters as the title.  Customizing Google Map markers The marker we placed can be customized pretty heavily. The full list  of options we can pass in can be seen at https:  developers. google.com maps documentation javascript  reference?hl=enMarkerOptions.  All that's left is to make a call to our new function inside our initialize   function  and pass in the JSON map list that we built in Python. The entire initialize    function is shown here with the new section highlighted:  function initialize   {   var mapOptions = {   center: new google.maps.LatLng -33.30578381949298,      26.523442268371582 ,   zoom: 15  };  map = new google.maps.Map document.getElementById "map-      canvas" , mapOptions ;  [ 121 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 7    google.maps.event.addListener map, 'click', function event {     placeMarker event.latLng ;  } ;  placeCrimes {{crimes  safe}} ; }  We simply called our placeCrimes   function and passed in the crimes. Note that  we used the Jinja built-in safe function by using the   pipe  symbol and passing  in our crimes data. This is necessary as, by default, Jinja escapes most special  characters, but we need our JSON string to be interpreted raw with all special  characters as is.  However, by using the safe function, we tell Jinja that we know that our data is safe  and at this stage, this is not necessarily the case. Just because we have no malicious  intent, it does not mean that all our data is inherently safe. Remember, most of the  pieces of data were submitted by our users, and our data is therefore definitely not  safe. We'll take a look at the big security hole we've opened in our app right after we  make sure that it works  with normal, expected usage  as intended.  If you're familiar with *nix shells,  or pipe should be pretty  straightforward syntax. If not, think of it as a usual function with input  and output. Instead of passing input as parameters in parentheses and  using some form of a return function to get output, we will instead  have our input on the left-hand side of the  symbol and the function  name on the right-hand side  in this case, safe . The input gets piped  through the function, and we are left with the output in place. This  syntax can be very useful to chain lots of functions together, as each outer  function is simply placed on the right-hand side after another  symbol.  Viewing the results First, test out the code locally. This will make sure that everything still runs and  will possibly catch some more subtle bugs as well. As we are using a mock for our  database function, we won't have a lot of confidence that this works until we see it  run on the VPS.  Once you run python crimemap.py in your terminal and visit   localhost:5000 in your browser, you should see the following:  [ 122 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Adding Google Maps to Our Crime Map Project   We can note a single marker with the details we specified in our MockDBHelper.   In the screenshot, we moved our mouse over the marker to make the title appear  with all the details of the crime.  Now it's time to commit to git and push to our VPS. Run the following commands  locally from your crimemap directory:  git add crimemap.py  git add dbhelper.py  git add mockdbhelper.py  git add templates home.html  git commit –m "add new crimes functionality"  git push origin master  [ 123 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 7   Then, SSH to your VPS to pull the new changes:  ssh username@123.456.789.123  cd  var www crimemap  git pull origin master  sudo service apache2 reload  If we visit the IP address of our VPS now, we should see the two crimes we added  before we were able to display them. As we used the real DBHelper and our MySQL  database for the production site, we should be able to add crimes using the form  and see each crime added as a marker to the map in real time. Hopefully, you'll get  something similar to the following screenshot:  [ 124 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Adding Google Maps to Our Crime Map Project   If things don't work out as expected, as always run the following on your VPS   and take a look at the output while visiting the site:  tail –f  var log apache2 error.log  Also, use your browser's debugger by pressing Ctrl + Shift + C to catch any  JavaScript errors that might have crept in.  Our crime map is now functional and can already be used to start tracking crime in   a town and keep people informed. However, we'll still add some finishing touches in  the next chapter before moving on to our final project.  Summary In this chapter, we looked at how to create a mock database in Python so that we  could develop our application without needing access to a real database. We also  added a Google Maps widget to our application and allowed our users to easily  submit a latitude and longitude by clicking on the map while being able to view   the locations and descriptions of existing crimes as well.  In the next chapter, we'll look at another injection vulnerability, XSS, and talk about  how to protect against it as well as input validation in general.  [ 125 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 7   www.it-ebooks.info   Validating User Input in Our  Crime Map Project  Users will always use your application in ways you didn't intend or expect, either  out of ignorance or malicious intent. Every bit of input that the user has any control  over should be validated to make sure it conforms to what is expected.  We'll polish off our second project by making sure that users can't break it  accidentally or through maliciously crafted input.  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:     Choosing where to validate    Trying out an XSS example    Validating and sanitizing  Choosing where to validate There are a few choices to make when it comes to validating user input and displaying  feedback that helps them fix any mistakes they make. The major choice is where to do  the validation: in the browser, on the server, or both.  We could do it in JavaScript in the user's browser. The advantages of this approach  are that the users will get faster feedback  they don't have to wait to send data to  our server, have it validated, and have a response sent back , and it also lightens the  load on our server; if we don't use CPU cycles and network bandwidth to validate  user data, it means we have lower costs associated with running our server. The  disadvantage of this approach is that we have no assurance that the user will not  bypass these checks; if the checks are run in the user's browser, then the user has full  control over them. This means that data that is validated by client-side checks is still  not guaranteed to be what we expect.  [ 127 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   We could do it on the server after the user submits the data. The advantages and  disadvantages of this approach are the opposite of those described earlier. We use  more processing time that we're paying for, but we get extra assurance about the  integrity of our checks. On the other hand, the user normally has to wait longer to  get feedback about legitimate  not malicious  errors.  The final option is to do both. This gives us the best of all worlds; we can give fast  feedback to the user in JavaScript, but then recheck the results on the server side to  make sure that nothing got past our client-side checks. The flipside of this is that  we end up wasting time on CPU cycles checking legitimate data twice, and we also  have to put more effort into development as we have to write validation checks in  JavaScript and in Python.  In this project, as we will implement our form management from scratch, we'll just  do some very basic checks on the server side and no checking on the client side. In  our next project, when we use frameworks to handle user input, we'll discuss how to  easily use some more sophisticated validation methods.  Identifying inputs that require validation We have already noted that not all browsers support the HTML5 "date" type  input. This means that, as our site stands, some users will possibly type the date of  the crime in manually, and this means that we need to be able to deal with the user  inputting dates in various formats. Our database expects yyyy-mm-dd  for example,  2015-10-10 for October 10, 2015 , but our users will not necessarily conform to this  format even if we tell them to. The Date field, then, is one of the inputs we would  want to validate. Our Latitude and Longitude fields are also editable by the user, and therefore the  user could enter text or other invalid coordinates in them. We could add validation  checks for these, but, as the user should never actually need to edit these values,  we'll instead consider how to make them read only. We'll add a validation check to  make sure that the user has not left them blank, though. The Description is the most obviously dangerous field. The user can freely input  text here, and this means that the user has opportunities to inject code into our app.  This means that instead of filling in a text description, as we'd probably expect, the  user can input JavaScript or HTML code here that interferes with the code that we  expect to run. Doing so would be an example of a so-called XSS or cross-site scripting  attack, and we'll look at some malicious inputs that a user might use here.  [ 128 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Validating User Input in Our Crime Map Project   Our last input is the Category. This might seem perfectly safe as the user has to select  it from a drop-down list. However, it's important that the drop-down is merely a  convenience, and, actually, a user with some very basic knowledge can use free-form  text here as well. This is because the browser uses the information from the form to  create a POST request, which it sends to our server. As a POST request is just text that  is structured in a certain way and sent over HTTP; there is nothing stopping our  tech-savvy users from constructing the POST request without using a web browser   they could use Python or another programming language instead or even some  more specialized, but freely available software, such as BURP Suite .  As we can see, all of our inputs need validation in some form or another. Before we  take a look at exactly how to go about validating input, let's take a brief look at what  a malicious user might do if we decided not to implement validation.  Trying out an XSS example One of the most sought-after attacks by malicious users is a so-called persistent XSS  attack. This means that the attacker not only manages to inject code into your web  app but this injected code also remains for an extended period of time. Most often,  this is achieved by tricking the app into storing the malicious, injected code in a  database and then running the code on a page on subsequent visits.  In the following examples, we will break our application, specific  inputs to our form. You will need to log in to the database on VPS  afterwards to manually clear these inputs that leave our app in a  broken state.  As our app currently stands, an attacker could carry out a persistent XSS attack by  filing out the Category, Date, Latitude, and Longitude fields as usual, and using the  following for the Description field:    alert 1 ;   [ 129 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 8   This might look a bit strange, but give it a go. You should see the following:  And after you click OK on the popup, you'll probably notice a strange excerpt  from JavaScript at the top of our page  your value for longitude will be different,  depending on where you placed the marker :  ", "longitude": 26.52799}] ; } function placeCrimes crimes  { for        i=0; i  Let's look at what happened here. If we look at the full source code of our page, as it  got interpreted by our browser, things will make more sense. Right-click on the page  and click on View Page Source or an equivalent. The placecrimes   call in the initialize function of our JavaScript code can be  seen to now read as follows:  placeCrimes [{"latitude": -33.305645, "date": "2015-10-10",   "category": "mugging", "description":   "  alert 1 ; ", "longitude": 26.52799}] ;  [ 130 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Validating User Input in Our Crime Map Project   If your browser uses any form of code highlighting, it'll be easier to see what's  happening. The opening   tag near the beginning of our page is now closed  by the description of our first crime, as our browser knows to interpret anything that  comes between   and   as JavaScript code. As we have    at the beginning of our "description", the browser closes this section of JavaScript.  Immediately after this, a new JavaScript section is opened by  , which is  the next part of our description. Following this, we have alert 1 ;, which simply  creates the pop-up box with 1 in it that we noted earlier. This script section is closed  again, and the rest of our page is now interpreted as a mess by our browser. We can  see the rest of our JSON  "longitude": …   until halfway through our for loop is  displayed to the user, and the "<" symbol from i<crimes.length is now interpreted  by the browser as another opening tag so that the JavaScript that follows this is  hidden again.  To fix our app, wipe all the crime data from your database with the following  commands  which you should run on VPS :  mysql crimemap –p     delete from crimes;  You should see a message about how many crime records were deleted from the  crimes table, similar to that seen in the following screenshot:  The potential of persistent XSS It may seem pretty bad that our web application is broken. Worse still, reloading  the page is not a solution. As the malicious description is stored in our database, the  same issue will appear no matter how many times we reload the page. Even worse,  the "alert 1 ;" example is just this—an example to show that the attacker has the  freedom to run any code he or she desires. Often, an attacker uses this to trick the  user into visiting another  malicious  page, banking on the fact that the user trusts the  original page and will, therefore, be more likely trust the content on it. The possibilities  are really only limited by our attacker's imagination.  [ 131 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 8   Validating and sanitizing To prevent the preceding, we've already chosen to inspect the data on the server side  and make sure it conforms to our expectation. We still have a few more choices to  make, though.  White and blacklisting We need to create some rules to choose between acceptable inputs and unacceptable  inputs, and there are two main ways of doing this. One way is to blacklist inputs that  look malicious. Using this method, we would create a list of characters that might  be used maliciously, such as  " ", and we will reject inputs that contain  these characters. The alternative is to use a whitelist approach. This is the opposite  of blacklisting, in that, instead of choosing which characters we won't allow, we can  choose a list of characters that we will allow.  It may seem like a nit-picky distinction, but it is important nonetheless. If we go with  a blacklist approach, we are more likely to be outsmarted by malicious users who  manage to inject code using only characters that we haven't added to our ban list.  On the other hand, using a whitelist approach, we are more likely to frustrate users  who want to use characters which we haven't thought to add to the whitelist.  As our app only requires a "description" input to be free-text and because our  app is localized  in the examples we used, the app is specific to Grahamstown, South  Africa, and therefore we will expect our users to only need normal Latin characters  and not, for example, Chinese characters , we should be able to employ whitelisting  without getting in the way of our users.  Validating versus sanitizing Next, we have to decide what to do with invalid input. Do we reject it completely  and ask the user to try again, or do we just strip away the invalid parts of the  user input and keep the rest? Removing or modifying user input  for example, by  adding escape characters  is referred to as sanitizing the input. The advantage of this  approach is that the user is often oblivious to it; if he or she inadvertently includes  a special character in the description of the crime and we remove it, it's unlikely to  make the rest of the description incomprehensible or worthless. The disadvantage is  that if the user does end up relying on too many characters that we have blacklisted,  it can corrupt the information to the point of being unusable or even misconstruing  what the user intended.  [ 132 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Validating User Input in Our Crime Map Project   Implementing validation With all of the preceding in mind, we want to:     Check the category that the user submits and make sure it is in the list of      Check the date that the user submits and make sure that we can properly   categories that we expect  understand it as a date     Check the latitude and longitude that the user submits and make sure that   these are parsable as floating point numbers     Check the description that the user submits and strip out all characters   except for those that are alphanumeric or part of a preselected list of basic  punctuation characters  Although we'll silently edit the description to remove non-whitelisted characters,  we want to reject the entire submission and make the user start again if the other  fields aren't as we expect. We, therefore, also want to add a way of displaying  custom error messages to the user after he or she submits the form. Let's add a few  Python functions to help us with all of this. We'll also restructure some of our code to  conform to the Don't repeat yourself DRY  principle.  Validating the category Previously, when we created the drop-down list for categories, we hardcoded the  two categories we wanted into our template. This is already not ideal as it means  that we have to write our more boilerplate code  such as HTML tags  if we ever want  to add or edit the categories. Now that we also want access the list of categories  in Python, so that we can validate that the user hasn't sneakily used a category that  isn't in our list, it makes sense to restructure it a bit so that we only define our list of  categories once.  We'll define the list in our Python code and then we can pass it to our template   to construct the drop-down list and use the same list for validation when the user  submits the form. At the top of crimemap.py, along with our other globals, add   the following:  categories = ['mugging', 'break-in']  In the return statement of the home   function, pass in this list as a named argument.  The line should now look similar to this:  return render_template "home.html", crimes=crimes,   categories=categories   [ 133 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 8   In home.html, change the   block to use a Jinja for loop, as follows:        {% for category in categories %}          {{category}}      {% endfor %}    With these small modifications, we have a much easier way to maintain our list  of categories. We can now also use the new list to validate. As the category is  provided by a drop-down list, the average user does not enter an invalid value here,  so we don't have to worry too much about providing polite feedback. In this case,  we'll just ignore the submission and return to the home page again.  Add the following if statement directly below where we loaded the category data  into a variable in the submitcrime   function:  category = request.form.get "category"  if category not in categories:     return home    If triggered, this return would happen before we add anything to the database,   and our user's attempted input would be discarded.  Validating the location As our location data should be populated automatically by the marker that the user  places on the map, we want to make these fields readonly. This means that our  JavaScript will still be able to modify the values as the marker gets used, but the  fields will reject input or modification from the user's keyboard. To do this, simply  add the readonly attribute where we define the form in our home.html template.  The updated input definitions should look as follows:   Latitude     Longitude     As with the drop-down list, though, the readonly property is only enforced at a  browser level and is easily bypassed. We, therefore, want to add a server-side check as  well. To do this, we'll use the Python philosophy of "it is better to ask for forgiveness  than permission", or, in other words, assume everything will be OK and deal with the  other cases in an except block instead of using too many if statements.   [ 134 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Validating User Input in Our Crime Map Project   If we can parse the user's location data into floating point numbers, it's almost  definitely safe as it's pretty difficult to do things such as modifying HTML, JavaScript,  or SQL code using only numbers. Add the following code around the section of the  submitcrime   function where we parse the location inputs:  try:     latitude = float request.form.get "latitude"       longitude = float request.form.get "longitude"   except ValueError:     return home    If there's any unexpected text in the latitude or longitude inputs, ValueError will  be thrown when we attempt to cast to the float type, and, again, we'll return to the  home page before putting any of the potentially dangerous data into our database.  Validating the date For the date input, we could take the same approach as we did for the category.  Most of the time, the user will select the date from a calendar picker and, therefore,  will be unable to input an invalid date. However, as not all browsers support the  date input type, sometimes, normal users will type out the dates manually, and this  may lead to accidental error.  Therefore, in this case, we don't only want to reject invalid input. We want to, as far  as possible, work out what the user intended, and if we cannot, we want to display   a message to the user to indicate what needs to be fixed.  To allow for a more flexible input, we'll use a Python module called dateparser.  This module allows us to take even inconsistently formatted dates and convert them  into accurate Python datetime objects. The first thing we need to do is install it  through pip. Run the following command locally and on VPS:  pip install --user dateparser  If you haven't used it before, you might like to play around a bit with the possibilities.  The following standalone script demonstrates some of the magic that dateparser  provides:  import dateparser print dateparser.parse "1-jan 15"  print dateparser.parse "1 week and 3 days ago"  print dateparser.parse "3 4 15"   All the preceding strings are correctly parsed into datetime objects, except, arguably,  the last one, as dateparser uses the American format and interprets it to be March 4,  2015, instead of April 3, 2015.  [ 135 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 8   Some more examples as well as other information about the dateparser module can  be found on PyPI at https:  pypi.python.org pypi dateparser.  Just using this package will solve a lot of our problems as we can now transform  invalid inputs into valid ones without any help from the user at all. The slight  inconvenience is that we have already set up our database to accept dates to be  inserted as strings in the "yyyy-mm-dd" format; however, to take advantage of our  new dateparser module, we'll want to convert the user's input to a datetime object.  The slightly counterintuitive workaround is to convert the string input we receive  from the user to a datetime object and then back to a string  which will always be in  the correct format  before passing it into our database code to store in MySQL.  First off, add the following helper function to your crimemap.py file:  def format_date userdate :     date = dateparser.parse userdate      try:         return datetime.datetime.strftime date, "%Y-%m-%d"      except TypeError:         return None      Also, add the imports for the datetime and dateparser modules to the top of  crimemap.py, as follows:  import datetime import dateparser  We'll pass the date as input by our user  userdate  into this function and parse this  using our dateparser module. If the date is completely unparsable  for example,  "aaaaa" , the dateparser.parse function will just return nothing instead of throwing  an error. Therefore, we will put the call to strftime, which will format the date as  a string in the correct format into a try except block; if our date variable is empty,  we'll get a TypeError, in which case our helper function will also return None.  Now, we need to decide what to do in case we cannot parse the date. Unlike the  other validation cases we looked at, in this case, we want to prompt the user with a  message saying that we were unable to understand his or her input. To achieve this,  we'll add an error message parameter to the home   function and pass in a relevant  error message from the submitcrime   function. Modify the home   function to add  the parameter and to pass the parameter into our template, as follows:  [ 136 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Validating User Input in Our Crime Map Project   @app.route " "   def home error_message=None :      crimes = DB.get_all_crimes        crimes = json.dumps crimes       return render_template "home.html", crimes=crimes,   categories=categories, error_message=error_message   Then, modify the submitcrime   function to add some logic to parsing the date  input by our user and to pass an error message to our home   function if we fail to  parse the date, as follows:  if category not in categories:     return home   date = format_date request.form.get "date"   if not date:     return home "Invalid date. Please use yyyy-mm-dd format"   We also need to add a section to our template file to display the error message if it  exists. We'll add it to the top of the form where it should catch the user's attention via  the following code:         Submit new crime      {% if error_message %}           {{error_message}}       {% endif %}        We will add the preceding if statement as we'll otherwise see the word "None"  appear above our form when the error_message variable has its default value of  None. Also, note that the message itself appears in a   tag with an ID of error.  This allows us to add some CSS to make the error message appear in red. Add the  following block to your style.css file in your static directory:  error {     color: red; }  [ 137 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 8   That's it for validating our date. If you have a browser that does not support the date  input, try creating a new crime and inputting a string that even dateparser cannot  interpret as a legitimate date to make sure you see the error as expected. It should  look something similar to the following image:  Flask provides some pretty nifty functionality for message flashing—that  is, to display optional text to the user at a specific position on the page.  This has some more powerful and flexible functionality than the basic  example we discussed, and should certainly be considered for similar  cases. Information about message flashing in Flask can be found at  http:  flask.pocoo.org docs 0.10 patterns flashing .  Validating the description We can assume that a user will be able to convey basic information about a crime  using only numbers, letters  capital and lowercase , and some basic punctuation  marks, so let's create a simple Python function that filters out all characters from a  string except the ones we have identified as safe. Add the following sanitize    function to your crimemap.py file:  [ 138 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Validating User Input in Our Crime Map Project   def sanitize_string userinput :     whitelist = string.letters + string.digits + " !?$.,;:-'  &"     return filter lambda x: x in whitelist, userinput   Then, add the import for string to the imports section of crimemap.py, as follows:  import string  Our sanitize_string   function is quite concise, and uses some of Python's  functional programming potential. The filter function applies another function  repeatedly for each element in a list and builds a new list based on the ones that  "pass." In this case, the function that we will pass into filter   is a simple lambda  function that checks whether or not a letter belongs to our whitelist. The result of  our function is a string similar to the input one, but with all the characters that aren't  part of our whitelist removed.  Our whitelist is built from all the letters  uppercase and lowercase , the digits one to  nine, and some basic punctuation marks that people may use while typing informal  descriptions of events.  To use our new function, simply change the line near the end of the submitcrime    function in crimemap.py from the following to the subsequent:  description = request.form.get "description"  description = sanitize_string request.form.get "description"    Note that, as our SQL driver mitigates against SQL injection and our json.dumps    function escapes double quotation marks, we should be largely safe just by blacklisting  characters such as angle brackets, which we used to demonstrate an XSS attack. This  would allow more flexibility for our users, but malicious users can be determined and  creative in crafting input that will bypass the filters we set up. Refer to https:  www. owasp.org index.php XSS_Filter_Evasion_Cheat_Sheet for some examples.  Give the validation changes a go locally first and then, if everything looks good  by committing to git, push the repo to the remote, and pull it onto VPS. Restart  Apache and visit your IP address. Try submitting a crime using   in the  description, and you'll notice when you hover the cursor over the marker for this  crime that all we've stored is "script". We will strip the slash and the angle brackets,  thus ensuring protection against XSS.  We already discussed the pros and cons of blacklisting and whitelisting, but, to  emphasise that whitelisting is not a perfect approach, take a look at the post here  about mistakes developers often make when whitelisting an input for users' names:  http:  www.kalzumeus.com 2010 06 17 falsehoods-programmers-believe- about-names   [ 139 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 8   The last change we can make to our dbhelper.py, mockdbhelper.py, and crimemap. py files is to remove the functions we no longer need. When we had a basic database  application that was not specific to crimes, we had the get_all_inputs  , add_ input  , and clear_all   functions in our DBHelper classes and the add   and  clear   functions in our crimemap.py file. All of these can be removed.  Summary We have spent a whole chapter looking at validation, but if you look at the major  companies that have faced information security breaches over the last few years,  you'll agree that security is worth spending some time on. We looked specifically   at cross-site scripting or XSS attacks, but we also discussed some more general   points of input validation. This takes us to the end of our second project.  One thing that is notably missing is to work out who added which crimes. If one  malicious user adds a bunch of bogus crimes to our database, they could potentially  mess up our entire dataset!  In our next project, we'll look at authenticating users through a User Account  Control system, which will give us more control over who we let on our site and  what they can do.  [ 140 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Validating User Input in Our Crime Map Project   Building a Waiter Caller App  After going through the headlines project, in which you learned the basics of Flask,  and the Crimemap project, in which you learned about some more useful Flask  features, such as how to use a database and how to write some basic JavaScript  code, we're now ready for our most sophisticated project yet! We will build a waiter  caller web application that allows restaurant patrons to easily call a waiter to their  table. The restaurant manager will easily be able to register for and start using our  application without the need to invest in expensive hardware.  We will dive even deeper into the Flask world, taking a look at some Flask extensions  to help us with user account control and web forms, and we'll look at how to use  template inheritance in Jinja, too. We'll also use the Bootstrap frontend framework so  that we don't have to do so much of the HTML and CSS code from scratch.  In contrast with the MySQL database we used for our previous application, we'll  take a look at a controversial alternative: MongoDB. MongoDB is a NoSQL database,  which means that we don't deal with tables, rows, and columns in it. We'll also  discuss exactly what this means.  One of the most difficult tasks for a waiter is to know when a patron needs something.  Either the patron complains that they waited for far too long before the waiter came  and asked about dessert options, or they complain that the waiter was constantly  interrupting conversation in order to ask whether everything was all right. In order  to solve this problem, some restaurants install dedicated buttons at each table which,  when pressed, notify the waiter that his attention is wanted. However, the cost of  specialized hardware and installation is prohibitive for smaller establishments and  often just too much hassle for larger ones.  [ 141 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   In our modern day and age, nearly all restaurant-goers have smartphones, and  we can leverage this fact to provide restaurants with a much more cost-effective  solution. When patrons want attention, they will simply visit a short URL on their  phone, and the waiters will receive a notification on a centralized screen.  We want the application to allow for multiple, unrelated restaurants to use the same  web application, so each should have a private login account for our system. We  want it to be easy for the restaurant manager to set up; that is, we as developers  should not need to be involved at all when a new restaurant joins the system.  The setup required for our application is as follows:      The restaurant manager signs up a new account on our web application    The restaurant manager provides basic information about how many tables   the restaurant has     The web application provides a unique URL for each table    The restaurant manager prints out these URLs and ensures that the relevant   URL is easily accessible from each table  The usage of our application should have the following features:     The restaurant staff should be able to log into the web application from    a centralized screen and see a simple notification page.     Some patrons would want service and visit the URL relevant to their table    on a smartphone, so this should be possible. In real time, the waiters should see a notification appear on a centralized  screen. The waiter will then acknowledge the notification on the screen and  attend to the patrons. If more notifications arrive before the first one is acknowledged, the later  ones should appear beneath the earlier ones.          Over the next three chapters, we'll implement a Flask application that has all of the  preceding features. We'll have a database to store the account information of all the  individual restaurants that register to use our application so that we can process  patron requests for each of them individually. Patrons will be able to make requests,  which will be registered in the database, while the restaurant staff will be able to  view current attention requests for their establishment. We'll build a user account  control system so that restaurants can have their own password-protected accounts  for our application.  [ 142 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Building a Waiter Caller App   To start with, we'll set up a new Flask application, Git repository, and Apache  configuration to serve our new project. We'll introduce Twitter's Bootstrap framework  as the one we'll use on the frontend. We'll download a basic Bootstrap template as a  start for the frontend of our application and make some changes to integrate it into a  basic Flask application. Then, we'll set up a user account control system that allows  users to register, log in, and log out of our application by supplying an e-mail address  and password.  In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:     Setting up a new git repository    Using Bootstrap to kick-start our application    Adding User Account Control to our application  Setting up a new Git repository As before, we need to create a new git repository to host our new project. The first  step is to go to log into the web interface of BitBucket or whichever code repository  host you are using, select the Create a new Repository option, and select the Git  radio option, taking note of the URL with which it provides you. As the next steps  are identical to the previous projects, we will give you only a summary. If you need  more fine-grained guidance, refer to the Installing and using git section of Chapter 1,  Hello, World!.  Setting up the new project locally To set up the local project structure, run the following commands locally:  git remote add origin    mkdir waitercaller  cd waitercaller  git init  mkdir templates  mkdir static  touch waitercaller.py  touch templates home.html  touch .gitignore  [ 143 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 9   We want to get the minimal running app for this project so that we can iron out any  configuration issues before we get started with development. Add the following to  your waitercaller.py file:  from flask import Flask  app = Flask __name__   @app.route " "  def home  :    return "Under construction"  if __name__ == '__main__':     app.run port=5000, debug=True   git add .  git commit –m "Initial commit"  git push origin master  Then, push the project outline to the repository with the following commands:  Setting up the project on our VPS On your VPS, run the following commands to clone the repository, and set up  Apache2 to serve our new project as the default website:  cd  var www   git clone    cd waitercaller  nano waitercaller.wsgi  Add the following code to the .wsgi file we created with the most recent command:  import sys sys.path.insert 0, " var www waitercaller"  from waitercaller import app as application  Now, hit Ctrl + X and select Y when prompted to quit Nano.  Lastly, create the Apache configuration file by running the following:  cd  etc apache2 sites-available  nano waitercaller.conf  [ 144 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Building a Waiter Caller App   Add the following configuration data to the waitercaller.conf file we just created:         WSGIScriptAlias    var www waitercaller waitercaller.wsgi     WSGIDaemonProcess waitercaller              WSGIProcessGroup waitercaller        WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}         Order deny,allow         Allow from all          Quit Nano, saving the new file as before. Now, to disable our crimemap project as the  default site and enable our new project instead, run the following commands:  sudo a2dissite crimemap.conf  sudo a2ensite waitercaller.conf  sudo service apache2 reload  Verify that everything worked by visiting the IP address of your VPS in your web  browser. You should see the Under construction string. Have another look at your  configuration and log files if things don't work out as expected.  Using Bootstrap to kick-start our  application In our previous projects, we spent quite a bit of time on frontend work, fiddling  around with CSS and HTML, and we didn't even touch on some of the frontend  problems that web application developers need to be aware of, such as making  sure our content looks good and functions correctly on all devices of all screen  sizes running any browser on any operating system. This diversity of browsers and  devices as well as the inconsistent way in which each of them implements certain  JavaScript, HTML, and CSS functionality is one of the biggest challenges of web  development, and there is no silver bullet to solve the problem. However, frontend  frameworks such as Bootstrap can take away some of the pain, providing shortcuts  for developers to improve their user experience.  [ 145 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 9   Introducing Bootstrap Bootstrap was developed by Twitter and is released under an open license. It can  greatly speed up CSS development as it provides many styles for different HTML  layouts and form inputs. It can also provide responsiveness; that is, it can allow your  website to automatically change the layout of certain elements based on the screen  size of your user's device. We'll discuss exactly what this means for us and for this  project later in the chapter.  Bootstrap has faced some criticism, but it still holds its popularity. There  are many alternatives with different strengths and weaknesses. As  modern web development is a fast-evolving field, there are also many  new frameworks that appear regularly. Existing frameworks often get  major updates and don't provide backward compatibility to old versions.  For important production web applications, current research into what  best fits the specific needs of this project is always crucial.  Bootstrap's main offerings are reusable in CSS and JavaScript modules. We'll mainly  use it for its CSS components.  Take a look at Bootstrap's homepage at http:  getbootstrap.com  as well as  the subpages at http:  getbootstrap.com getting-started examples and  http:  getbootstrap.com components  to get an idea of what Bootstrap provides.  Instead of writing CSS from scratch, Bootstrap allows us to use various inputs,   icons, navigation bars, and other often-needed components of a website that look  good by default.  Downloading Bootstrap There are a few ways to install Bootstrap, but keeping in mind that Bootstrap can  be thought of as a collection of some JavaScript, CSS, and icon files, we will not do  anything too fancy. We can simply download a .zip file of the compiled code files  and use these files in our local project. We'll include bootstrap in our git repository,  so there is no need to install it on our VPS as well. Perform the following steps:  1.  Head over to http:  getbootstrap.com getting-started download  and select the Download Bootstrap option, which should be the compiled  and minified version without documentation.  [ 146 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Building a Waiter Caller App   2.  Unzip the file you downloaded, and you'll find a single directory called  bootstrap-3.x.x  here, the repeated letter x represents numbers that  indicate which version of Bootstrap is contained . Inside the directory,   there will be some subdirectories, probably js, css, and fonts.  3.  Copy the js, css, and fonts directories to the static directory of the   waitercaller project. Your project should now have the following structure: waitercaller  templates     home.html static     css      fonts      js .gitignore waitercaller.py  Because of the regular Bootstrap updates, we included a complete copy of the code  for Bootstrap 3.3.5 in the accompanying code bundle  the latest version during the  writing of this book . While the latest version is probably better, it might not be  compatible with the examples we give. You can choose to test the waters with the  version we provide, knowing that the examples should work as expected, or jump in  at the deep end and, if necessary, try to work out how to adapt the examples to the  newer Bootstrap code.  Bootstrap templates Bootstrap strongly encourages users to build customized frontend pages instead of  simply using existing templates. You've probably noticed a lot of modern web pages  look very similar; this is because frontend designing is difficult, and people like  taking shortcuts. As this book focuses on Flask development, we'll also take a bit of  a frontend shortcut and start with one of the example template files that Bootstrap  provides. The template file we'll work with can be seen at http:  getbootstrap. com examples jumbotron , and the adaptation for our project can be found in the  accompanying code bundle for this chapter at tempates home.html. You can note  from the similarity of the two files that we didn't have to do too much work to get a  basic web page that also looks good.  [ 147 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 9   Copy the code from the templates home.html file in the code bundle to the same  place in your own project directory that we created earlier. If you included all the  Bootstrap files properly in your static folder, opening this new file directly in your  web browser will result in a page that looks similar to the following screenshot.   Note that at this stage, we still use pure HTML and none of the Jinja functionality,  so you can just open the file locally in your web browser instead of serving it from a  Flask application. :  We can note the advantages of the styling of inputs, headers, the navigation bar, and  Jumbotron  the gray bar near the top with the oversized Waiter Caller text in it  that  we can achieve with very little code. However, perhaps the most significant time- saving element of using Bootstrap is the responsiveness that our site has. Bootstrap is  based on a grid layout, which means that different elements of the grid can rearrange  themselves to better fit on any device. Note this part of HTML from the template:             Simple   A "row" has space for 12 columns. Our three main content elements below the  Jumbotron each take up four columns, thus filling the row  4 x 3 = 12 . We specified  this using the class="col-md-4" attribute. Think of this as a medium  md  column  of size four. You can read more about how the grid system works and take a look at  some examples at http:  getbootstrap.com css .  [ 148 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Building a Waiter Caller App   There's also some code that doesn't look used in the preceding screenshot, similar   to this:  <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle collapsed" data-     toggle="collapse" data-target="navbar" aria-expanded="false"     aria-controls="navbar">  The two preceding excerpts are perhaps the most important components in making  our web application responsive. To understand what this means, resize your browser  window while the page is open. This simulates how our page will be seen on smaller  devices, such as phones and tablets. It should look similar to the following screenshot:  We can note that our three main content elements that used the Bootstrap grid  functionality are now arranged beneath each other instead of side by side. This is  ideal for smaller devices in which users are more used to scrolling down than to  looking for more content on the side. Our navigation bar has also become more  concise with the login inputs now hidden.   [ 149 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 9   These can be revealed by selecting the hamburger icon in the upper right-hand corner;  this is a controversial, but highly prevalent, element in web development. Most  users instinctively know that they can touch the icon to get some form of menu or  expansion, but there are many criticisms of using this technique. For now, we'll just  accept this as normal practice and not go into the problems behind it. It's definitely  better than trying to display exactly the same content no matter the screen size and  having our users zoom into the page section by section, depending on which part  they need to see.  Adding user account control to our  application For user account control, a user is expected to log in and authenticate using a  password. For example, when you log in to your Webmail account, you enter  your password upon visiting the page. Thereafter, all your actions are taken as  authenticated; that is, you do not have to enter your password again when you  send an e-mail. The Webmail client remembers that you are logged in, and you are  therefore allowed to complete certain actions.  However, HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means that we have no direct way of  knowing that the user who logged in is the same user who made the request to send  an e-mail. As a workaround for this problem, we will give the user a cookie when he  or she logs in initially, and the user's browser will then send this cookie to us with  every subsequent request. We'll use our database to keep track of which users are  currently logged in. This allows us to authenticate the user for every request without  requesting the user's password multiple times.  We could implement this from scratch using Flask cookies in a similar way to what we  saw in our Headlines project. However, there are numerous steps that we would need  to implement, such as selecting which pages in our application require authentication  and ensuring that the cookie is secure, and be involved in deciding what information  to store in the cookie.  Instead, we'll go up one level of abstraction and use the Flask-Login extension.  Introducing Flask-Login Flask-Login is a Flask extension that implements the groundwork required for  all user account control systems. To use this, we need to install it through pip and  then create a user class that follows a specific pattern. You can find a summary of  Flask-Login as well as comprehensive documentation at https:  flask-login. readthedocs.org en latest .  [ 150 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Building a Waiter Caller App   Installing and importing Flask-Login To install Flask-Login, run the following command:  pip install --user flask-login  As with all the Python modules we install, remember to do this both locally and on  your VPS.  To begin with, we'll add the most basic login functionality possible. Our application  will display You are logged in for users who have authenticated, but users who do  not enter a correct password will not be able to see the message.  Using Flask extensions When we install Flask extensions, we can automatically access them through the  flask.ext path. The first class we'll use from the Flask-Login extension is the   so-called LoginManager class. We'll also use the @login_required decorator to  specify which routes are restricted to users who are logged in. Add the following  imports to your waitercaller.py file:  from flask.ext.login import LoginManager from flask.ext.login import login_required  Now, we need to connect the extension to our Flask app. In a pattern that will  become familiar as we use more Flask extensions, add the following line to  waitercaller.py directly below the place where you create the app variable:  app = Flask __name__  login_manager = LoginManager app   The LoginManager class we instantiated now has a reference to our application.  We'll use this new LoginManager class to—you guessed it—manage logins for   our application.  Adding a restricted route Now, let's add a route to our application at  account and make sure that only  authenticated users can view this page. The easy part of this step is to make sure   that non authenticated users can't see the page, so we'll start with this.  First, we want our application to render our Bootstrap template by default. Add the  following route to the waitercaller.py file:  @app.route " "  def home  :     return render_template "home.html"   [ 151 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 9   Now, we'll add a restricted route that users who aren't logged in can't see. Add the  following function to waitercaller.py:  @app.route " account"  @login_required def account  :    return "You are logged in"  Note that we're using the @login_required decorator. Similarly to the @app.route  decorator, this is a function that takes the function below it as input and returns a  modified function. In this case, instead of the routing magic, it'll verify that the user  is logged in, and if not, it'll redirect the user to an Unauthorized page instead of  returning the content we specified in the return statement. It's important that the  @app.route decorator is first and the @login_required one is below it, as in the  preceding example.  You've probably seen 404 page not found errors sometimes while  browsing the Web. While 404 is especially infamous, there are  many error codes that are part of the HTTP specification. Different  browsers may show different default error messages when these are  received, and it's also possible to define custom error pages to be  shown when the specified errors are hit.  As we haven't set up any of the login logic yet, no user should be able to authenticate  and view the new route we created. Start your Flask application locally and try to  visit the account route at localhost:5000 account. If all went well, you should see  an unauthorized error message similar to the following screenshot:  Authenticating a user The Internet can be a dark and scary place. This is why you need to put passwords  into many web applications; the password proves that you are who you claim to  be. By telling us something that only you know, the web application knows you are  "you" and not an imposter.  [ 152 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Building a Waiter Caller App   The simplest way to implement a password checking system would be to store  passwords associated with usernames in a database. When the user logs in, you  need to first verify that the username exists, and if it does, you need to verify that the  password the user just gave matches the one that he or she used when registering.  In practice, this is a terrible idea. Databases may be accessed by any number of  people, including employees of the company that runs the web application and,  potentially, hackers. Instead, we'll eventually store a cryptographic hash of the user's  password; however for now, to make sure our login system works, we'll work with  plaintext passwords.  We'll set up a mock database that is very similar to the one we used in our Crime  Map project and check whether we can allow a mock user to view our account page  if, and only if, the correct password is entered.  Creating a user class As we are using the Flask-Login module, we need to create a User class that  conforms to a strict format. Flask-Login is flexible enough to allow some more  advanced login functionality, such as distinguishing between active and nonactive  accounts as well as anonymous users. We won't use these features, but we need to  create a User class that can work with Flask-Login, so we'll have some methods  that look redundant.  Create a new file called user.py in your waitercaller directory. Add the following  code to it:  class User:    def __init__ self, email :       self.email = email     def get_id self :       return self.email     def is_active self :       return True     def is_anonymous self :       return False     def is_authenticated self :       return True  [ 153 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 9   Flask-Login requires that we implement a get_id   method in our User class that  returns a unique identifier for the user. We'll be using the user's e-mail address for  this, so in the get_id   function we can simply return that.  We'll regard all our users as having active accounts; so, in this method, which is  also required, we'll simply return True. The opposite goes for the is_anonymous    function; while this is also required, we won't deal with the concept of anonymous  logins in our application, so we'll always return False.  The last function may look a bit odd; we'll always return True for is_ authenticated  . This is because we only create the user object when the correct  username and password combination is entered, so if the user object exists, it'll be  authenticated.  Mocking our database for users We'll create a MockDBHelper class again and also create a configuration file to  indicate that this should be used locally when we test our application and don't  have access to the database. It needs to have a function that takes a username and  password and checks whether these exist in the database and are associated with  each other.  First, create a file called mockdbhelper.py in your waitercaller directory and add  the following code:  MOCK_USERS = {'test@example.com': '123456'}  class MockDBHelper:        def get_user self, email :       if email in MOCK_USERS:          return MOCK_USERS[email]       return None  At the top, we have a dictionary that acts as the database storage. We have a single  get_user   method that checks whether a user exists in our database and returns  the password if it does.  Now, create a config.py file in the waitercaller directory and add the single line  as follows:  test = True  [ 154 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Building a Waiter Caller App   As in our last project, this file will let our application know whether it is running in our  test  local  environment or in our production  VPS  one. Unlike our previous project,  we'll add other information into this file later that doesn't involve the database, which  is why we'll call it config.py instead of dbconfig.py. We don't want to check this file  into our git repository as it'll be different on our VPS and will also contain sensitive  database credentials that we don't want to store; so, create a .gitignore file in your  waitercaller directory with the following lines:  config.py *.pyc  Logging in a user Our template already has a login form set up that allows a user to enter an e-mail  and a password. We'll now set up functionality that allows us to enter and check  the input into this form against our mock database. If we enter an e-mail and  password that exist in our mock database, we'll log the user in and allow access to  our  account route. If not, we'll just redirect back to the home page  we'll look at  displaying feedback to a user who inputs invalid information in the next chapter in  the Adding user feedback using WTForms section .  Adding imports and configuration We need to import the login_user function that is part of the Flask-Login  extension as well as our new User class code and database helper. Add the   following lines to your imports in waitercaller.py:  from flask.ext.login import login_user  from mockdbhelper import MockDBHelper as DBHelper from user import User  As we don't have a database helper except for our mock one at the moment, we'll  always import the mock one. Later, we'll use the value in config.py to decide which  database helper to import—the real or mock one—as we did in our previous project.  We also need to create a DBHelper global class so that our application code can  easily talk to our database. Add the following line beneath the import section of  waitercaller.py:  DB = DBHelper    [ 155 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 9   Finally, we also need to configure a secret key for our application. This is used to  cryptographically sign the session information cookies that Flask-Login hands  out to our users when they log in. Signing the cookies prevents our users from  editing them manually, which helps prevent fraudulent logins. For this step, you  should create a long and secure secret key; you will never have to remember it,  so don't think about it as you would about a password or passphrase. Although  randomly mashing your keyboard should be sufficient, humans are generally terrible  at creating unbiased randomness, so you could also use the following command  to create a random string using  dev urandom  changing 100 to the number of  characters you want  via the following:  cat  dev urandom  base64  head -c 100 ; echo  Once you have a long random string of characters, add the following line to your  waitercaller.py file under the place where you declared the app variable,  substituting the random characters for your own:  app.secret_key = 'tPXJY3X37Qybz4QykV+hOyUxVQeEXf1Ao2C8upz+fGQXKsM'  Adding the login functionality There are two main parts of logging a user in to consider. The first is when the user  enters an e-mail address and password to authenticate, and the second is when the  user does so by sending the required cookie—that is, he or she is still in the same  browser session as when a successful login was completed. Writing the login function We already created the stub of our login route for the first case, so now, we will   flesh that out a bit to check the input information against our database and use  Flask-Login to log the user in if the e-mail and password match.  We'll also introduce a cleaner way of calling one Flask route from a separate one.  Add the following lines to the imports section of waitercaller.py:  from flask import redirect from flask import url_for  The first takes a URL and creates a response for a route that simply redirects   the user to the URL specified. The second builds a URL from a function name.   In Flask applications, you'll often see these two functions used together, as in the  following example.  [ 156 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Building a Waiter Caller App   Write the login function in waitercaller.py to match what follows through   this code:  @app.route " login", methods=["POST"]  def login  :    email = request.form.get "email"     password = request.form.get "password"     user_password = DB.get_user email     if user_password and user_password == password:       user = User email        login_user user        return redirect url_for 'account'      return home    We also need to add import for the request library. Add the following line to the  import section of waitercaller.py:  from flask import request   We'll load the user's input into email and password variables and then load the  stored password into a user_password variable. The if statement is verbose as we  explicitly verified that a password was returned  that is, we verified that the user  exists  and that the password was correct, even though the second condition implies  the first. Later on, we'll talk about the trade-off of differentiating between the two  conditions when giving feedback to our user.  If everything is valid, we will create a User object from the e-mail address, now  using the e-mail address as the unique identifier required by Flask login. We will  then pass our User object to the Flask-Login module's login_user   function so  that it can handle the authentication magic. If the login is successful, we will redirect  the user to the account page. As the user is now logged in, this will return the "You  are logged in" string instead of the "Unauthorized" error we got before.  Note that we will create a URL for our account page using the url_for   function.  We will pass the result of this into the redirect   function so that the user is taken  from the  login route to the  account one. This is preferable to simply using   the following:  return account    Our intention is more explicit, and the user will see the correct URL in the browser   that is, both will take the user to the  account page , but if we don't use the  redirect   function,  login will still be displayed in the browser even on   the  account page.  [ 157 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 9   Creating the load_user function If the user has already logged in, their browser will send us information through the  cookie that Flask-Login gave them when we called the login_user function. This  cookie contains a reference to the unique identifier we specified when we created our  User object—in our case, the e-mail address.  Flask-Login has an existing function that we called user_loader, which will  handle this for us; we just need to use it as a decorator for our own function that  checks the database to make sure the user exists and creates a User object from the  identifier we are given.  Add the following function to your waitercaller.py file:  @login_manager.user_loader def load_user user_id :     user_password = DB.get_user user_id      if user_password:        return User user_id   The decorator indicates to Flask-Login that this is the function we want to use to  handle users who already have a cookie assigned, and it'll pass the user_id variable  from the cookie to this function whenever a user visits our site, which already  has one. Similarly to what we did before, we will check whether the user is in our  database  user_password will be blank if user_id is invalid , and if it is, we will  recreate the User object. We'll never explicitly call this function or use the result as  it'll only be used by the Flask-Login code, but our application will throw an error if  a user who is given a cookie by our login   function visits the site and Flask-Login  can't find an implementation for this user_loader   function.  It might seem unnecessary to check the database in this step considering we gave  the user a supposedly tamper-proof token that proves that he or she is a valid user,  but it is in fact necessary as the database may have been updated since the user last  logged in. If we make the user's session token valid for a long time  recall that in our  Headlines project, we made the cookies last for a year , there is the possibility that  the user's account will have been modified or deleted since the cookie was assigned.  Checking the login functionality It's time to give our new login functionality a try! Fire up the waitercaller.py  file locally and visit localhost:5000 in your web browser. Type in the e-mail ID  test@example.com and password 123456 from our mock database and hit the login  button. You should be redirected to http:  localhost:5000 account and view the  You are logged in message.  [ 158 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Building a Waiter Caller App   Close your browser and reopen it, this time visiting localhost:5000 account  directly. As we didn't tell Flask-Login to remember users, you should now see the  Unauthorized error again. Because of the nature of our application, we would expect most users to want to stay  logged in so that the restaurant staff can simply open the page in the morning and use  the functionality straightaway. Flask-Login makes this change very straightforward.  Simply change the line of your login   function that reads the following:   login_user user   Your new login   function should now read:  login_user user, remember=True   Now, if you repeat the preceding steps, you should view the You are logged in  message as shown in the following screenshot, even after restarting your browser:  Now that we can log a user in, let's take a look at how we can allow the user to log  out as well.  Logging out a user Flask-Login provides a logout function that works straight out of the box.   All we have to do is link it up to a route. Add the following route to your  waitercaller.py file:  @app.route " logout"  def logout  :    logout_user      return redirect url_for "home"    [ 159 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 9   Then, add the import for the logout_user   function to the imports section of  waitercaller.py:  from flask.ext.login import logout_user  Note here that there's no need to pass the User object to Flask-Login for this call;  the logout   function simply removes the session cookie from the user's browser.  Once the user is logged out, we can redirect them back to the home page.  Visit localhost:5000 logout in your browser and then attempt to visit  localhost:5000 account again. You should see the Unauthorized error again as  the test@example.com user got logged out.  Registering a user It's great that we can log users in, but at the moment we can only do so with the  mock user that we hardcoded into our database. We need to be able to add new  users to our database when the registration form is filled out. We'll still do all of this  through our mock database, so every time our application is restarted, all the users  will be lost  they will only be saved in the local Python dictionary variable, which is  lost when the application is terminated .  We mentioned that storing the users' passwords was a very bad idea; so first, we'll  take a brief look at how cryptographic hashing works and how we can manage  passwords more securely.  Managing passwords with cryptographic hashes Instead of storing the password, we want to store something that is derived from  the password. When the user registers and gives us a password, we'll run some  modification on it and store the result of the modification instead. Then, the next  time the user visits our site and uses the password to log in, we can run the same  modification on the input password and verify that the result matches what we stored.  The catch is that we want our modification to be nonreversible; that is, someone who  has access to the modified password should not be able to deduce the original.  Enter hash functions. These little pieces of mathematical wizardry take a string as  input and return a  big  number as output. The same string input will always result  in the same output, but it is almost impossible for two different inputs to produce  the same output. Hash functions are so-called one-way functions as it is provably  impossible to deduce the input if you only have the output.  [ 160 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Building a Waiter Caller App   Password storage and management is a big topic that we can only  touch on in this project. For more information on most things regarding  information security, www.owasp.org is a good resource. Their  comprehensive guide to storing passwords securely can be found at  https:  www.owasp.org index.php Password_Storage_ Cheat_Sheet.  Python hashlib Let's take a look at how to use hash functions in Python. Run the following in a  Python shell:  import hashlib  hashlib.sha512 '123456' .hexdigest    As output, you should see the hash ba3253876aed6bc22d4a6ff53  d8406c6ad864195ed144ab5c87621b6c233b548baeae6956df346ec8c17f5ea  10f35ee3cbc514797ed7ddd3145464e2a0bab413, as shown in the following screenshot:  The random-looking string of hexadecimal characters is the sha512 hash of the  '123456' string, and this is what we will store in our database. Every time the user  enters the plaintext password, we'll run it through the hash function and verify that  the two hashes meet up. If an attacker or employee sees the hash in the database, they  cannot masquerade as the user because they cannot deduce '123456' from the hash.  [ 161 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 9   Reversing hashes Actually, the heading of this section isn't entirely true. While there is no way to reverse  a hash and write a function that takes the preceding hexadecimal string as input and  produces '123456' as output, people can be pretty determined. The hacker may still  try every possible likely input and run it through the same hash function and keep  doing this until the hashes match up. When the hacker comes across an input that  produces ba3253876aed6bc22d4a6ff53d8406c6ad864195ed144ab5c87621b6c233b548  baeae6956df346ec8c17f5ea10f35ee3cbc514797ed7ddd3145464e2a0bab413 as an output,  he has effectively cracked the password.  However, hashing functions tend to need a lot of processing power, so it is not  practical to run through large amounts of input  known as brute forcing . People  have also created so-called rainbow tables with all common inputs precomputed  and stored in a database so that the results can be found instantly. This is a classic  space-time trade-off that is so often seen in computer science. If we compute hashes  for all possible inputs, it will take a long time; if we want to compute every possible  combination in advance so that we can look up the results instantly, we need a lot of  storage space.  If you go to a hash reversal website, such as http:  md5decrypt.net en Sha512 ,  and input the exact hex string you noted here, it'll tell you that the decrypted version  is 123456.  It didn't actually try every possible combination of inputs in the claimed 0.143  seconds, but it stored the answer from a previous time when the hash was computed.  Such sites have a large database containing mappings and plaintext strings along  with their hashed equivalents.  [ 162 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Building a Waiter Caller App   If you hash a string such as b^78asdflkjwe@xx...&AFs[--l and paste the  resulting hash into the md5decrypt website, you'll note that the string is not common  enough for this particular site to have precomputed, and instead of getting the plain  text back again, you'll get a screen that looks similar to the following screenshot:  We want all of the passwords we store to be complicated enough to not exist in  precomputed hash tables. However, our users are more likely to choose passwords  that are common enough that they have been precomputed. The solution is to add  what is known as salt to our passwords before we store them. Salting passwords As users tend to use weak passwords, such as 123456, that quite likely exist in  precomputed hash tables, we want to do our users a favor and add some random  value to their passwords when we store them. This makes it even more difficult  for a malicious attacker who has access to the stored hash to gain the user's private  password, even though we will store the random value we used with the password.  This is known as salting the password; similarly to salting food, it is easy for us to  add some salt to the password, but removing the salt is hopefully impossible.  In summary, we want to:     Accept a plaintext password from the user at registration time    Add some random value  salt  to this password to strengthen it    Hash the concatenation of the password and salt    Store the hash and salt  [ 163 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 9   When the user logs in, we need to:     Take the plaintext password from the user    Find the stored salt in our database and add it to the user's input    Hash the concatenation of the password and salt    Verify that the result matches what we previously stored  Implementing secure password storage in Python To implement the preceding, we'll create a very small PasswordHelper class that  will take care of the hashing and generation of random salts. Although this is very  little code, when we use the standard hashlib, os, and base64 Python libraries, it  is good practice to abstract all the cryptography logic to its own class. That way, if  we change how we implement password management, we can make most of our  changes to this new class and not have to touch the main application code.  We also need to make some changes to our login   function, flesh out our  registration   function, and create a new method for our database helper   code that will add a new user to our mock database.  Creating the PasswordHelper class Let's start with PasswordHelper. Create a file called passwordhelper.py in your  waitercaller directory and add the following code to it:  import hashlib import os import base64  class PasswordHelper:     def get_hash self, plain :       return hashlib.sha512 plain .hexdigest       def get_salt self :       return base64.b64encode os.urandom 20       def validate_password self, plain, salt, expected :       return self.get_hash plain + salt  == expected  [ 164 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Building a Waiter Caller App   The first two methods are used when a user registers for the first time and can be  explained as follows:     The get_hash   method is just a wrapper of the sha512 hash function that  we looked at earlier. We'll use this to create the final hash that we will store  in our database.     The get_salt   method uses os.urandom   to generate a cryptographically  secure random string. We will encode this as a base64 string as the random  string may contain any bytes, some of which we may have issues with  storing in our database.  The validate_password   method is used when the user logs in and gives us the  original plaintext password again. We'll pass in what the user gave us  the plain  parameter , the salt that we stored when they registered, and verify that hashing the  two produces the same hash that we stored  the expected parameter . Updating our database code We now need to store a password and salt associated with each user; we can't use  the simple e-mail and password dictionary that we had before. Instead, for our mock  database, we'll use a list of dictionaries, with every piece of information we need to  store having a key and value.  We'll also update the code in mockdbhelper.py to read as follows:  MOCK_USERS = [{"email": "test@example.com", "salt":       "8Fb23mMNHD5Zb8pr2qWA3PE9bH0=", "hashed":   "1736f83698df3f8153c1fbd6ce2840f8aace4f200771a46672635374073cc876c      "f0aa6a31f780e576578f791b5555b50df46303f0c3a7f2d21f91aa1429ac22e"}]  class MockDBHelper:     def get_user self, email :         user = [x for x in MOCK_USERS if x.get "email"  == email]         if user:             return user[0]         return None     def add_user self, email, salt, hashed : MOCK_USERS.append {"email": email, "salt": salt, "hashed":hashed}   [ 165 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 9   Our mock user still has the password 123456, but a potential attacker can no   longer work this out by looking up the hash in a rainbow table. We also created the  add_user   function, which takes the email, salt, and hashed password for a new  user and stores a record of this. Our get_user   method now needs to loop through  all the mock users to find out whether any match the input e-mail address. This is  inefficient but will be handled more efficiently by our database, and as we will never  have hundreds of mock users, we don't need to worry about this. Updating our application code In our main waitercaller.py file, we need to add another import for our password  helper and instantiate a global instance of our password helper class so that we can  use it in our register   and login   functions. We also need to modify our login    function to account for the new database model and flesh out our register   function  to perform some validation and call the database code to add a new user.  Add the following line to the imports section of waitercaller.py:  from passwordhelper import PasswordHelper  Then, add the following near the place where you created the DBHelper   object:  PH = PasswordHelper    Now, modify the login   function to read as follows:  @app.route " login", methods=["POST"]  def login  :    email = request.form.get "email"     password = request.form.get "password"     stored_user = DB.get_user email     if stored_user and PH.validate_password password,        stored_user['salt'], stored_user['hashed'] :        user = User email        login_user user, remember=True        return redirect url_for 'account'      return home    The only real change is in the if statement, in which we will now use the password  helper to validate the password using the salt and user-provided password. We will  also change the variable name of the user to stored_user as this is now a dictionary  instead of just the password value it used to be.  [ 166 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Building a Waiter Caller App   Finally, we need to build the register   function. This will use the password and  database helper to create a new salted and hashed password and store this along  with the user's e-mail address in our database.  Add a  register route and associated function to the waitercaller.py file with  the following code:  @app.route " register", methods=["POST"]  def register  :    email = request.form.get "email"     pw1 = request.form.get "password"     pw2 = request.form.get "password2"     if not pw1 == pw2:       return redirect url_for 'home'      if DB.get_user email :       return redirect url_for 'home'      salt = PH.get_salt      hashed = PH.get_hash pw1 + salt     DB.add_user email, salt, hashed     return redirect url_for 'home'    We asked the user to input their password twice on our registration form as it's  easy for users to make a typo when they register and then not be able to access their  account  as they registered with a different password from the one they meant to .  Therefore, in this step, we can confirm that the two passwords entered by the user  are the same.  We also verified that the user doesn't already exist as each user needs to use a unique  e-mail address.  Finally, we generated a salt, created a hash from the password and salt, and stored  this in our database. Then, we redirected the user back to homepage, testing our  registration functionality.  It's time to give the application a test run again. Close your browser and restart the  application locally. Visit the homepage and register an account by choosing an e-mail  and password. When you get redirected to the homepage after registration, log in  using the same username and password you just registered with. If all went well,  you'll see the You are logged in message. Again, visit http:  localhost:5000  logout in order to log out.  [ 167 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 9   Summary In this chapter, we looked at how to use Bootstrap to make our application look good  out of the box and to be responsive based on our user's screen size. We got a basic  User Account Control system up and running, and we can register users, log users  in, and log them out again.  We also spent some time looking at how to securely store passwords using  cryptographic hash functions and salts.  In the next chapter, we'll build out the functionality of our application, which we  discussed in the project outline at the start of this chapter. We'll also look at an easier  way to create the forms that our visitors will use to interact with our application.  [ 168 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Building a Waiter Caller App   Template Inheritance and  WTForms in Waiter Caller  Project  In the previous chapter, we created a rudimentary user account system. However,  we only made a very simple route access controlled—the one that simply showed  the string "You are logged in". In this chapter, we'll add some more of the desired  functionality, and allow logged-in users to add restaurant tables, see the URLs  associated with these tables, and view attention requests from customers. One of  the problems we'll come across is that of wanting to reuse the same elements for  different pages of our application. You'll see how to solve this problem without  code duplication by using Jinja's inheritance system. As mentioned in the previous  chapter, we do not communicate very well with our user when mistakes, such  as entering an incorrect password, are made. To address this, we'll take a look  at another Flask extension, WTForms, and see how it can simplify creating and  validating forms.  In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:     Adding account and dashboard pages to our application    Shortening URLs using the bitly API    Adding functionality for handling attention requests    Adding user feedback through WTForms  [ 169 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Adding the Account and Dashboard  pages We want to add two new pages to our application: 'Dashboard', where all requests  from the patrons of a particular restaurant can be seen, and 'Account', where the  restaurants can manage their tables and view the URLs that they need to make  available on the tables.  We could simply create two new .html files in our templates directory and  write the HTML from scratch. But we'll soon find that we need many of the same  elements from our home page  at the very least, the parts that include and configure  Bootstrap . Then we'll be tempted to just copy and paste the HTML from the home  page and start working on our new page from there.  Introducing Jinja templates Copying and pasting code is usually a sign that something is wrong. In application  code, it means that you haven't modularized your code well, and you need to create  some more classes and probably add a couple of import statements to include the  reused code wherever it is needed. Using Jinja, we can follow a very similar pattern,  by using template inheritance. We'll first split our home page into two separate  template files, base.html and home.html, with all the elements that we want to  reuse in the base file. We can then have all three of our other pages  Home, Account,  and Dashboard  inherit from the base template, and only write the code that differs  across the three. Jinja handles inheritance by using the concept of blocks. Each parent template can  have named blocks, and a child that extends a parent can fill in these blocks with its  own custom content. The Jinja inheritance system is quite powerful, and accounts for  nested blocks and overwriting existing blocks. However, we're only going to scratch  the surface of its functionality. We'll have our base template contain all the reusable  code, and it'll contain one blank block named content and one named navbar. Each  of our three pages will extend from the base template, providing their own version  of the content block  for the main page content  and the navigation bar. We'll need to  make the navigation bar dynamic, because the Login fields of the bar at the top of the  page will only appear if the user isn't logged in.  [ 170 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Template Inheritance and WTForms in Waiter Caller Project   Creating the base template Create a new file called base.html in your templates directory, and insert the  following code:                          <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,       initial-scale=1">       Waiter Caller                    <!-- HTML5 shim and Respond.js for IE8 support of HTML5       elements and media queries -->             <script src="https:  oss.maxcdn.com html5shiv 3.7.2         html5shiv.min.js">        <script src="https:  oss.maxcdn.com respond 1.4.2         respond.min.js">                      {% block navbar %}                                    Dashboard             Account                              {% endblock %}      {% block content %}     {% endblock %}  [ 171 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 10                                   &copy; A. Non 2015                  <!-- Bootstrap core JavaScript     ================================================== -->     <!-- Placed at the end of the document so the pages load faster       -->     <script   src="https:  ajax.googleapis.com ajax libs         jquery 1.11.3 jquery.min.js">                In the preceding code, we have all our header and our page footer code—elements that  will be common across all our pages—in one file. We define two blocks, using the Jinja  syntax, which is similar to the other Jinja statements that we have seen, namely:  {% block content %} {% endblock %}  And  {% block navbar %} [...] {% endblock %}  In this example, content and navbar are the names of our blocks, and we can  choose these freely, while block and endblock are Jinja keywords, and the {% %}  symbols are used to indicate the Jinja statements as in earlier examples. This is in  itself a completely valid Jinja template; even though the content block is empty, we  can render the template directly from our Flask app, and we would see a page that  simply pretended that the content block didn't exist.  We can also extend this template, though; that is, we can create children using it as  the parent. Children have the option of overwriting any of the specified blocks simply  by declaring them again. We declared navbar as a block as our home page will use  the navigation bar that we wrote earlier—the one that includes a login form. Once  logged in, however, our pages for dashboard and account will have exactly the same  navigation bar—the one we define in our base template.  [ 172 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Template Inheritance and WTForms in Waiter Caller Project   Creating the dashboard template Our dashboard page will eventually show all customers' requests for service so that a  waiter can easily see which tables need attention. For now though, we'll just create an  outline of the page. Create a new file in your templates directory called dashboard. html, and add the following code:  {% extends "base.html" %}  {% block content %}                        Dashboard           View all patron requests below                                                    Requests             All your customers are currently satisfied - no             requests                              {% endblock %}  The most important line in the preceding code snippet is the first one—we use the  Jinja extends keyword to indicate that this template should inherit all the code  contained in another template. The keyword is followed by the filename of the  template to inherit from, contained within inverted commas.  Following that, we simply create the content block in exactly the same way we did in  our base template. This time, instead of leaving it blank, we add some HTML to be  displayed on our dashboard page.  Creating the account template The account page will be the one where the user can add new tables, delete tables,  or get the URL for the existing tables. Again, as we do not yet have any application  code to represent a table, we'll just create an outline of the page. Create a file called  account.html in your templates directory, and add the following code:  {% extends "base.html" %}  {% block content %}        [ 173 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 10                    Account           Manage tables and get URLs                                                    Tables                               {% endblock %}  Creating the home template The home.html template contains the entire code specific to our home page, and  which isn't part of the base template. The code can be seen in the code bundle as  templates home_1.html, but is not included here as it is too long. Have a look at  it and see how we define a new navbar block which contains the login form, and  which overrides the default one provided in the base template. Similarly, it defines  the content block, which replaces the empty content block that we defined in our  base template. The end result hasn't changed—we'll still see exactly the same home  page, but now the code is split between the base.html and home.html files, allowing  us to reuse large parts of it for the new pages that we created previously.  Adding the routing code We need our Python code to return the new template files when  account and   dashboard are visited. Add the dashboard   function to your waitercaller.py  file, and modify the account function   to read as follows:  @app.route " dashboard"  @login_required def dashboard  :   return render_template "dashboard.html"   @app.route " account"  @login_required def account  :   return render_template "account.html"   Give the new pages a go! Start the application locally as before, by running:  python waitercaller.py  [ 174 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Template Inheritance and WTForms in Waiter Caller Project   Navigate to http:  localhost:5000 to see the home page. Log in using the form,  and now, instead of the bare message we had before, you should see a nicer looking  skeleton of the Account page, as seen in the following image:  Click on the Dashboard link in the navigation bar at the top, and you should see the  skeleton for that page, too, as seen in the following image:  [ 175 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 10   Creating restaurant tables Now we need to introduce the concept of a table to our application, and be able to  represent this both in our database and in our application code. A table should have  the following attributes:     An ID number that uniquely identifies that table across all users of our app    A name that is user-definable and unique within a specific user's tables    An owner so that we will know to which user a table belongs  If we were following an Object Oriented Programming style religiously, we would  create a Table class which had these properties. We would then also create a bunch of  other classes for everything in our application. Following this approach, we would also  create methods to serialize each of our objects into something that can be stored in our  database, and more methods to deserialize them from the database back to objects.  For the sake of brevity, and because our model is simple enough, we'll be taking a  shortcut that is sure to offend some, and simply use Python dictionaries to represent  most of our objects. We'll see when we add MongoDB to our application that these  dictionaries will be trivial to write to and read from the database.  Writing the restaurant table code Let's have a brief look at what our tables need to do. First, the user of our app will  need to be able to add and remove new tables on the account page—both initially  when an account is registered and later if changes need to be made. Secondly, the  user should be able to view the URL associated with each table, so that these URLs  can be printed and made available at the physical tables. When a new table is added,  we'll need to create a mock database.  We'll start by providing our users with an input box on the account page, where  they can input the name or number of a new table in order to create it. When a new  table is created, we'll create a unique ID number and use that to create a new URL.  We'll then use the bitly API to create a shortened version of the URL—one that our  users' patrons will be able to type into a smartphone more easily. We'll then store the  table name, ID, and shortened URL in our mock database. Adding the create table form In the account.html template, add the following directly beneath the line   Tables :   Add new table  <form class="form-inline" action=" account createtable"   method="POST">  [ 176 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Template Inheritance and WTForms in Waiter Caller Project     <input type="text" name="tablenumber"     placeholder="Table number or name" class="form-control">        This is a very basic form with a single input for a new table name and a button   to submit the form. If you load the application and navigate to the Account page,  you should now see something like the following image:  Adding the create table route Creating a table backend is not too complicated, but it has subtleties that are important  to understand. First, our users can give the table any name they want. For most users,  these names will probably just be incrementing numbers starting from 1 and ending  at the number of tables in the restaurant, as this is a common way for restaurants to  name their tables. Because many restaurant managers will be using our application,  we can't assume that these names will be unique across all accounts. Most users of our  application will probably have a table called 1. Therefore, when a restaurant patron  indicates that he or she is at Table 1 and wants service, we have to be able to pick the  correct Table 1 from potentially many restaurants. To solve this, each table in our  database will have a unique ID that we'll use for table identification in the URLs, but  we'll display the user-chosen name  for example, 1  on the Account page to allow our  users to easily manage their personal list of tables.  When we insert a new item into our database, we'll get the unique ID of that   item. But, because we want to use the ID as part of the URL, we get into a sort of  chicken-or-egg-first situation where we need to insert the table into the database in  order to get the ID, but we also need the ID in order to create the URL before we can  properly insert the table into the database.  To solve this problem, we have to insert a half-created table into our database to get  the ID, then use the ID to create the URL, and then update the table we just created  to associate it with the URL.  [ 177 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 10   Add the following route to your waitercaller.py file which does this  or rather,  will do this once we've created the required functions in our database code :  @app.route " account createtable", methods=["POST"]  @login_required def account_createtable  :   tablename = request.form.get "tablenumber"    tableid = DB.add_table tablename, current_user.get_id      new_url = config.base_url + "newrequest " + tableid   DB.update_table tableid, new_url    return redirect url_for 'account'    Note that we structure all the functionality of our application that is related to our  account page under a sub-route  account . We preface the function name for  routes that belong to the account with account_. This helps us have clearer sections  in our application code, which can become messy and unmaintainable as we add  more and more routes.  We have to associate each table with an owner, so we use the FlaskLogin current_ user functionality to get the currently logged-in user's ID. We're also going to use  our config.py file to define the base URL to be associated with the tables.  Add the following imports to waitercaller.py in order to use the current_user  functionality and access our config:  from flask.ext.login import current_user import config  Add the following to the config.py file  remember, this isn't part of the Git  repository, so this value is only used for local development :  base_url = "http:  127.0.0.1:5000 "  The preceding URL is exactly equivalent to localhost:5000 that we've been using,  as 127.0.0.1 is a special IP address that always points back to your own machine.  However, we'll use an IP address in our config instead of localhost to maintain  compatibility with the Bitly API that we'll use in the next section, Shortening URL's  using the bitly API, of this chapter. Adding the create table database code The mock database code for our tables is similar to that for our users and passwords.  Create the following list of dictionaries at the top of the mockdbhelper.py file to  store your tables:  MOCK_TABLES = [{"_id": "1", "number": "1", "owner":   "test@example.com","url": "mockurl"}]  [ 178 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Template Inheritance and WTForms in Waiter Caller Project   The preceding code also creates a single table, 1, and assigns it to our mock user.   Note that 1, which is the value of the _id key, is the ID number that, for our  production system, will be unique across all user accounts. The 1 that is the value of  the number key is the user-chosen value that might be duplicated across different users  of our system. Because we only have one test user, we'll simplify our mock code, and  always use the same value for both the unique ID and the user-chosen number.  For our mock database, adding a table is simply appending a new dictionary that  represents a table to our list of existing mock tables. Add the following method to the  mockdbhelper.py file:  def add_table self, number, owner :     MOCK_TABLES.append {"_id": number, "number": number, "owner":      owner}      return number  We return number from this function, which is the mock ID. In our test code, this is  the same value that was input to this function. In our real code, this number will be  the generated ID, and will be different from the input.  Finally, we need to add the update_table   method that will allow us to associate a  URL with a table. Add the following method to mockdbhelper.py:  def update_table self, _id, url :     for table in MOCK_TABLES:         if table.get "_id"  == _id:             table["url"] = url             break  Our application code gives the preceding method both the table ID generated by the  add_table   method and the URL to associate with the table. The update_table    method then finds the correct table and associates the URL with the table. Again, the  for loop through a list might look inefficient as opposed to using a dictionary, but  it's important for our mock database code to use the same ideas as the real database  code that we'll write in the next chapter. As our real database will store a collection  of tables, our mock code emulates this by storing them in a list. Adding the view table database code We now have the functionality for adding new tables in place, but we can't see them  yet. We want all the existing tables to be listed on the account page so that we can see  which tables exist, have the ability to delete them, and view their URLs.  [ 179 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 10   Adding the following method to mockdbhelper.py will allow us to access the  existing tables of a specific user:    def get_tables self, owner_id :     return MOCK_TABLES  Again, we simplify and have our test code ignore the owner_id argument and return  all the tables  as we only have one test user . However, it's important that our mock  methods take the same inputs and outputs as our real methods will, as we don't want  our application code to be aware of whether it is running production or test code. Modifying the account route to pass table data We should get the latest information about the tables from the database and display  these tables to the user each time our account page is loaded. Modify the  account  route in waitercaller.py to look as follows:  @app.route " account"  @login_required def account  :     tables = DB.get_tables current_user.get_id        return render_template "account.html", tables=tables   This preceding method now gets the tables from the database and passes the data  through to the template. Modifying the template to show the tables Our template now has access to the table data, so all we need to do is to loop through  each table and display the relevant information. The terminology used could get a bit  confusing at this point, as we will use an HTML table to display information about  our virtual restaurant tables, even though the uses of the word table are unrelated.  HTML tables are a way to display tabulated data, which in our case is data about the  restaurant tables.  In the account.html file, add the following code beneath the line  tables :             No.       URL       Delete        {% for table in tables %}        [ 180 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Template Inheritance and WTForms in Waiter Caller Project                    {{table.number}}           {{table.url}}           <input type="submit" value="Delete"           class="form-control">          <input type="text" name="tableid"           value="{{table._id}}" hidden>                 {% endfor %}    The preceding code creates a simple table of tables, displaying the table number   user chosen , the URL, and a delete button for each table. Each table is, in fact, a  form that submits a request to delete that specific table. In order to do this, we also  use a hidden input containing the unique ID of each table. This ID is passed along  with the delete request so that our application code knows which table to delete  from the database. Adding the delete table route to our backend code Add the following route to your waitercaller.py file, which simply accepts the  table ID that needs to be deleted and then asks the database to delete it:  @app.route " account deletetable"  @login_required def account_deletetable  :   tableid = request.args.get "tableid"    DB.delete_table tableid    return redirect url_for 'account'    Create the following method in mockdbhelper.py, which accepts a table ID and  deletes that table:      def delete_table self, table_id :         for i, table in enumerate MOCK_TABLES :             if table.get "_id"  == table_id:                 del MOCK_TABLES[i]              break  Similar to the update code that we wrote earlier, it's necessary to loop through the  mock tables to find the one with the correct ID before we can delete it.  [ 181 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 10   Testing the restaurant table code We've added quite a lot of code to our application. Since a lot of the different sections  of code that we've added depend on each other, it has been difficult to actually  run the code while writing it. However, now we have the functionality to create,  view, and delete tables, so we can now give our application another test run. Fire  up the application, log in, and navigate to the Account page. You should see the  single mock table and be able to add more using the create table form. Play around  by adding new tables and deleting the existing ones. When you add tables, they  should get a URL associated with them based on their number  remember that for  our production application, this number will be a long unique identifier instead of  simply the number that we choose for our table . The interface should look like the  following image:  Also take another look at the mobile view for this page by resizing the browser  window, making it narrow enough to trigger the layout switch. Note that because  we've used Bootstrap's responsive layout features, the Delete buttons shunt up  closer to the URLs and the Create button moves beneath the text input, as in the  following image:  [ 182 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Template Inheritance and WTForms in Waiter Caller Project   This might not look quite as good as the full-sized view, but it'll certainly be helpful to  our visitors who want to use our site from their phones, as they won't need to worry  about zooming in or scrolling sideways to access all the functionality of our site.  Shortening URLs using the bitly API Our users will not want to type in the long URLs that we currently provide for  calling a waiter to their table. We'll now look at using the bitly API to create shorter  equivalents of the URLs that we've already created. The shorter URLs, which can  be typed into address bars  especially on mobile devices  more easily, will then be  shown as being associated with the corresponding tables instead of the longer ones  we have now.  [ 183 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 10   Introducing Bitly The premise behind Bitly—and many similar services—is simple. Given a URL of  arbitrary length, the service returns a shorter URL of the form bit.ly XySDj72.   Bitly and similar services normally have very short root domains  bit.ly is five  letters , and they simply maintain a database that links the short URLs they create  to the longer ones input by the users. Because they use a combination of lower- and  uppercase characters as well as digits to create the shortened URLs, there is no  shortage of combinations to use, even while keeping the total length of the URL   very short.  Using the bitly API As with the other APIs that we have used, bitly is free to use within certain  limitations, but requires registration in order to get an API token. The bitly API  is accessed over HTTPS and returns JSON responses  similar to what we've seen  before . To interface with the API, we'll use a few lines of Python along with the  urllib2 and json standard libraries.  Getting a bitly oauth token At the time of writing, bitly offers two ways of authenticating with their API.   The first is to use an API token given to you when you register. The second way   is to use an oauth token. As API tokens are being deprecated by bitly, we'll be using   an oauth token.  The first step is to register an account on bitly.com and confirm your e-mail  address. Simply head over to bitly.com, hit the Sign up button, and give a  username, e-mail address and password. Click the confirmation link that they   send to the provided e-mail, and sign in to your bitly account.  To register for an oauth token, go to https:  bitly.com a oauth_apps  and enter your password again when prompted. You should now see your  new oauth token displayed on the screen. Copy this, as we'll need it in the  Python code that we're about to write. It should look something like this:  ad922578a7a1c6065a3bb91bd62b02e52199afdb  [ 184 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Template Inheritance and WTForms in Waiter Caller Project   Creating the bitlyhelper file Following the pattern we've used throughout the building of this web application,  we'll create a BitlyHelper class to shorten the URLs. Again, this is good practice, as it  allows us to easily replace just this module with another link shortening service if we  ever need to. Create a file named bitlyhelper.py in your waitercaller directory  and add the following code, substituting your bitly oauth token as appropriate. The  token in the following snippet is valid for this Waiter Caller application. You should  substitute the token that you received by following the steps outlined above.  import urllib2 import json  TOKEN = "cc922578a7a1c6065a2aa91bc62b02e41a99afdb" ROOT_URL = "https:  api-ssl.bitly.com" SHORTEN = " v3 shorten?access_token={}&longUrl={}"  class BitlyHelper:      def shorten_url self, longurl :         try:             url = ROOT_URL + SHORTEN.format TOKEN, longurl              response = urllib2.urlopen url .read               jr = json.loads response              return jr['data']['url']         except Exception as e:             print e  This class, BitlyHelper, provides a single method that takes in a long URL and  returns a short one. There should be nothing about the last code snippet that is  difficult to understand, as it only uses the ideas we've already seen while using  JSON-based APIs over HTTP.  Using the bitly module To use our bitly code, we simply need to create a BitlyHelper object in our main  application code, and then use it to create a short URL every time a new restaurant  table is created. Modify the globals section of waitercaller.py as follows:  DB = DBHelper   PH = PasswordHelper   BH = BitlyHelper    [ 185 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 10   And add the import for BitlyHelper   to the imports section of waitercaller.py:  from bitlyhelper import BitlyHelper  Now modify the createtable method to read as follows:  @app.route " account createtable", methods=["POST"]  @login_required def account_createtable  :   tablename = request.form.get "tablenumber"    tableid = DB.add_table tablename, current_user.get_id      new_url = BH.shorten_url config.base_url + "newrequest " +     tableid     DB.update_table tableid, new_url    return redirect url_for 'account'    Fire up the app and go to the account page again. Create a new table, and you should  see that the URL of the new table is a bitly URL. If you visit this URL in the browser,  you'll see that it automatically redirects to something like http:  127.0.0.1  newrequest 2  which, in turn, should throw a server error at this point .  Now that we can associate a short URL with every new table created, we need to add  the idea of a request to our application, so that when our users' patrons visit these  URLs, we notify the restaurant of the request for attention.  Adding functionality to handle attention  requests We need to deal with two aspects of attention requests. The first, as discussed earlier,  is to create new requests when a user visits a URL. The second is to allow the waiters  of the restaurant to view these requests and mark them as resolved.  Writing the attention request code When a user visits a URL, we should create an attention request and store it in the  database. This attention request should contain:     The time the request was made    The table from which the request was made  As before, we'll just use a Python dictionary to represent the attention request object.  We need to have our application code create new attention requests and allow these  requests to be added, retrieved, and deleted from the database.  [ 186 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Template Inheritance and WTForms in Waiter Caller Project   Adding the attention request route Add the following route to waitercaller.py:  @app.route " newrequest  "  def new_request tid :   DB.add_request tid, datetime.datetime.now      return "Your request has been logged and a waiter will be with    you shortly"  This route matches a dynamic table ID. Since our URLs use the globally unique  table ID and not the user-chosen table number, we don't need to worry about which  restaurant owns the table. We tell our database to create a new request, which  contains the table ID and the current time. We then display a message to the patron,  notifying him or her that the request was successfully made. Note that this is the  only route for the application that our users' patrons will use. The rest of the routes  are all intended to be used only by the restaurant managers or waiters themselves.  We also need the Python datetime module to get the current time. Add the  following line to your imports section in waitercaller.py:  import datetime  Adding the attention request database code The database code for the attention requests uses the same ideas as the code we  recently added for dealing with restaurant tables. Add the following global at the top  of mockdbhelper.py:  MOCK_REQUESTS = [{"_id": "1", "table_number": "1","table_id": "1",     "time": datetime.datetime.now  }]  The preceding global creates a single mock attention request for table number 1    an existing mock table  and sets the time of the request to be the time when we  started the waitercaller app by running:  python waitercaller.py  Whenever we make changes to our app during development, the server restarts,   and this time will also be updated to the current time whenever this happens.  We also need to add the import for the datetime module to the top of the dbconfig. py file:  import datetime  [ 187 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 10   For the actual add_request   method, it is again important to distinguish between  the table number  user chosen  and the table ID  globally unique across all our  users . The URL used for creating the request made use of the globally unique ID,  but the waiters will want to see the human readable table name next to the request  notification. At the time of adding a request, we therefore find the table number  associated with the table ID and include that as part of the stored request.  Add the following method to mockdbhelper.py:      def add_table self, number, owner :         MOCK_TABLES.append              {"_id": str number , "number": number, "owner":               owner}          return number  Again, we use table_id as the unique ID for our dictionary that represents a request.  As before, when we add a real database, we will generate a new request ID here, which  will not be the same as our table ID.  Add the get and delete methods for attention  requests While we are editing the database code, add the following methods as well:  def get_requests self, owner_id :     return MOCK_REQUESTS  def delete_request self, request_id :     for i, request [...]         if requests [...]             del MOCK_REQUESTS[i]             break  The first method gets all attention requests for a specific user and will be used to  populate our dashboard page with all the unresolved requests that require attention  from waiters. The second deletes a specific request and will be used  also from the  dashboard page  when waiters mark a request as resolved.  If our Waiter Caller application aimed to provide more advanced  functionality, we might add a property to requests to mark them as  resolved, instead of deleting them outright. If we wanted to provide  an analysis on how many requests were being made, how long  they took on an average to be resolved, and so on, then keeping the  resolved requests would be essential. For our simple implementation,  resolved requests are of no further use, and we simply delete them.  [ 188 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Template Inheritance and WTForms in Waiter Caller Project   Modifying the dashboard route to use attention  requests When the restaurant manager or waiter opens the dashboard of the app, they should  see all current attention requests along with the time when the request was made    so that the patrons who have been waiting for longer can be prioritized . We have   the time the request was logged, so we'll calculate the time elapsed since the request  was made.  Modify the dashboard   route in waitercaller.py to read as follows:  @app.route " dashboard"  @login_required def dashboard  :     now = datetime.datetime.now       requests = DB.get_requests current_user.get_id        for req in requests:         deltaseconds =  now - req['time'] .seconds         req['wait_minutes'] = "{}.{}".format  deltaseconds 60 ,             str deltaseconds % 60 .zfill 2       return render_template "dashboard.html", requests=requests   The modified dashboard  route grabs all the attention requests that belong to the  currently logged in user, using current_user.get_id   as before. We calculate  a delta time for each request  the current time minus the request time  and add this  as an attribute for each request in our requests list. Then we pass the updated list  through to the template.  Modifying the template code to display attention  requests We want our dashboard code to check if any attention requests exist and then to  display each of these in a way similar to the way the tables are displayed on the  account page. Every attention request should have a Resolve button to allow the  waiter to indicate that he has dealt with the request.  If no attention requests exist, we should display the same message we had   displayed on the dashboard page previously, indicating that all the patrons   are currently satisfied.  [ 189 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 10   Add the following code to the body of dashboard.html, removing the placeholder  statement that we added previously:   Requests  {% if requests %}                  No.         Wait         Resolve            {% for request in requests %}                              {{request.table_number}}             {{request.wait_minutes}}             <input type="text" name="request_id"             value="{{request._id}}" hidden>            <input type="submit" value="Resolve"             class="btn btn-primary">                        {% endfor %}     {% else %}    All your customers are currently satisfied - no requests  {% endif %}  The preceding code is very similar to the table code we saw for the accounts template.  Instead of the Delete button, we have a Resolve button, which similarly uses a hidden  text input containing the request ID to resolve the correct attention request.  Adding the resolve request application code Let's add the application code to handle resolving requests. Similar to the way we  used the sub-route  account for all our account functionality, we use  dashboard in  the form discussed earlier. Add the following route to waitercaller.py:  @app.route " dashboard resolve"  @login_required def dashboard_resolve  :   request_id = request.args.get "request_id"    DB.delete_request request_id    return redirect url_for 'dashboard'    [ 190 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Template Inheritance and WTForms in Waiter Caller Project   We've already added the database code to remove an attention request, so here we  simply need to call that code with the correct request ID, which we have from the  hidden field in our template.  With that, most of the functionality of our application should be testable. Let's try   it out!  Testing the attention request code Fire up the app, and test out all the new functionality. First, navigate to the Account  page and then, in a new tab, navigate to the URL listed for the test table  or add a  new table and use the new URL to retest the earlier code as well . You should see the  'Your request has been logged and a waiter will be with you shortly' message as in  the following image:  Now go back to the application and navigate to the Dashboard page. You should   see the mock request as well as the new request you just created by visiting the URL,  as seen in the following screenshot:  [ 191 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 10   Refresh the page and note that the values in the 'Wait' column get incremented  appropriately  every refresh will recalculate the deltas in the application code .  Auto-refreshing the dashboard page The waiters will not want to constantly refresh the dashboard in order to check for  new requests and to update the wait times on the existing one. We'll add a meta  HTML tag to tell the browser that the page should be refreshed at regular intervals.  We'll add a generic placeholder for meta tags in our base template and then override  it with the refresh tag in our dashboard.html template.  In the dashboard.html file, add a Jinja block that contains the meta HTML tag above  the content block:  {% extends "base.html" %} {% block metarefresh %}   {%  endblock %}  {% block content %}  Meta HTML tags indicate messages that don't directly relate to the content that   we are serving. They can also be used to add information about the author of a   page or to give a list of keywords that search engines may use while indexing the  page. In our case, we're specifying a meta tag that asks the browser to refresh every  ten seconds.  In the base.html file, create an equivalent empty placeholder:      {% block metarefresh %} {% endblock %}       Waiter Caller   Now open the app in your browser again and navigate to the dashboard page. Every  10 seconds, you should see the page refresh and the wait times update. If you create  new attention requests, you'll see these appear after the automatic refresh as well.  Adding user feedback with WTForms We now have a web application that is largely functional, but still fails to provide   the user with helpful feedback, especially when it comes to submitting web forms.  Let's look at how to make our application more intuitive by providing feedback  when the user succeeds or fails to complete various actions.  [ 192 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Template Inheritance and WTForms in Waiter Caller Project   To make our life easier, we'll use another Flask add-on, WTForms, which lets us  validate inputs by using prespecified patterns or by creating our own. We'll use  WTForms to implement all our web forms, namely:     The registration form    The sign-in form    The create table form  Introducing WTForms You might have noticed that creating the registration form for new users to sign up  for our web app was a bit cumbersome. We had to create the HTML form in our  template file and then fetch all the input data when the form was submitted in our  Python backend code. In order to do this, we had to use the same strings, such as  email and password, in our HTML code  for the name attribute  and in our Python  code  to load the data from the various fields into variables . These strings, email  and password, are examples of what are sometimes called magic strings. It might  seem obvious to us, while creating the application, that the strings have to be the  same in both the files, but to another developer who might need to maintain the  application in the future, or even to our future selves, this implicit link might   be a lot less obvious and more confusing.  Furthermore, we had to use a fairly ugly if statement in our application code to  make sure that the passwords matched. It turns out that we want to do much more  validation on user input than just checking that the passwords match. We probably  want to also validate that the e-mail address looks like an e-mail address, that  the password isn't too short, and possibly more besides. As our user-input forms  get longer, and the validation rules get more complicated, we can see that our  application code would quickly get pretty messy if we carried on developing forms  as we have been doing so far.  Finally, as mentioned earlier, our forms failed to provide the user with helpful  feedback when things went wrong.  WTForms solves all of these problems in a simple and intuitive way. We'll soon  explain how to create Python classes to represent forms. These classes will contain  validation rules, field types, field names, and feedback messages, all in the same  place. Our Jinja templates and our application code can then use the same object to  render the form  when the user views the page  and to process the input  when the  user submits the form . Using WTForms therefore allows us to keep our code cleaner  and to speed up development. We'll take a quick look at installing WTForms for  Flask, before diving into how we can use it for improving our application.  [ 193 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 10   Note that WTForms is a general Python web development add-on that works with  many different Python web development frameworks  such as Flask, Django, and  others  and template managers  such as Jinja2, Mako, and others . We'll install a  Flask-specific extension that will install WTForms and make it easy to interface with  our Flask application.  Installing Flask-WTF We need to install the WTForms add-on for Flask. This is done in the same way  as our previous extensions. Simply run the following command  as always,  remembering to do it both locally and on your VPS :  pip install --user Flask-WTF  Creating the registration form Now let's take a look at building forms. We'll be building a few forms, so we'll create  a new Python file in our project to hold all of these. In your waitercaller directory,  create a file called forms.py and add the following code:  from flask_wtf import Form from wtforms import PasswordField from wtforms import SubmitField from wtforms.fields.html5 import EmailField from wtforms import validators  class RegistrationForm Form :     email = EmailField 'email',       validators=[validators.DataRequired  , validators.Email  ]      password = PasswordField 'password',       validators=[validators.DataRequired  ,       validators.Length min=8, message="Please choose a password       of at least 8 characters" ]      password2 = PasswordField 'password2',       validators=[validators.DataRequired  ,       validators.EqualTo 'password', message='Passwords must       match' ]      submit = SubmitField 'submit', [validators.DataRequired  ]   The class, RegistrationForm, inherits from Form, a generic form object that we  find inside the flask_wtf extension. Everything else is from the wtforms module  directly  and not from the Flask-specific extension . The form is built from a number  of different fields—in our case, an EmailField, two PasswordFields, and a Submit  field. All of these will be rendered as their HTML equivalents in our template.   We assign each of these desired fields to variables.   [ 194 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Template Inheritance and WTForms in Waiter Caller Project   We'll use these variables to render the fields and to retrieve data from the fields.   Each time we create a field, we pass in some arguments. The first is a string  argument to name the form. The second argument is a list of Validators. Validators  are sets of rules that we can use to differentiate between valid input and invalid  input. WTForms provides all the validators that we need, but it's also easy to write  custom validators. We use the following validators:     DataRequired: This simply means that if the field is left blank, the form is   invalid for all fields.     Email: This uses a regular expression to ensure that the e-mail address is  made up of alphanumeric characters, and has an @ symbol and a full-stop  in their appropriate places.  Fun fact: this is a surprisingly complicated  problem! See http:  www.regular-expressions.info email.html.     EqualTo: This ensures that the data entered in the field is the same as the   data entered into another field.     Length: This validator takes optional min and max arguments to define the  number of characters the data should contain. We set this to a minimum of 8  to ensure that our users don't pick very weak passwords.  Recall our discussion of the trade-offs between backend and frontend validation and  note that these are all backend validation methods, completed server-side. Therefore,  it is still worthwhile to add the Email validator even if the user's browser supports  HTML5; the fact that it is an email field will prevent the user from submitting an  invalid e-mail address  using a frontend validation check .  Another thing about validators is that we can add a message argument for each  validator—not just for each field—and each field can have more than one validator.  We'll see later how to display this message to the user if that specific validation   check fails.  It's important to note that the variable names you choose for each form field  email,  password, and password2 in the registration form that we created previously  are  more important than most variable names because the name and id attributes for the  final HTML field will be taken from the variable names.  Rendering the registration form The next step is to use our form object for rendering an empty registration form when  a user loads our home page. To do this, we have to modify both our application  code  to create an instance of the registration form class and pass it to the template   and our frontend code  to render our fields from the variables of the class, instead of  hardcoding them in HTML .  [ 195 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 10   Updating the application code In our waitercaller.py file, we need to import the form we created, instantiate it,  and pass it to our template.   Add an import for our registration form:  from forms import RegistrationForm  Now instantiate the form in our home   function and pass the form on to the  template. The final home   function should read as follows:  @app.route " "  def home  :   registrationform = RegistrationForm     return render_template "home.html",     registrationform=registrationform   Updating the template code Now that our template has access to an instantiated RegistrationForm object,   we can use Jinja to render the fields of our form. Update the registration form in  home.html to read as follows:   Register now      {{ registrationform.csrf_token }}                       {{ registrationform.email class="form-control",           placeholder="Email Address"  }}                                     {{ registrationform.password class="form-control",           placeholder="Password"  }}                                     {{ registrationform.password2 class="form-control",           placeholder="Confirm Password"  }}                      [ 196 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Template Inheritance and WTForms in Waiter Caller Project                   {{ registrationform.submit class="btn btn-primary           btn-block" }}                  The Bootstrap boilerplate  the div tags specifying Bootstrap classes  remains  unchanged, but now, instead of creating input fields in HTML, we call functions  belonging to our registrationform variable that was passed in from the home    route. Each variable that we declared in our RegistrationForm class  email,  password, password2, and submit  is available as a function to which we can pass  additional HTML attributes as arguments. The name and id attributes will be set  automatically based on the variable names we provided when we wrote the form,  and we can add further attributes, such as class and placeholder by passing them  in here. As before, we use 'form-control' as the class of our inputs, and also specify  the 'placeholder' values to prompt the user to input information.  We also render the csrf_token field at the beginning of the new code. This is a  very useful security default that WTForms provides. One of the more common web  application vulnerabilities is called Cross Site Request Forgery  CSRF . Although  a detailed description of this vulnerability falls outside the scope of this book, in  short, it exploits the fact that cookies are implemented at the browser level rather  than at a web page level. Because cookies are used for authentication, if you log  into your one site that is vulnerable to CSRF, and then in a new tab, navigate to a  malicious site that can exploit a CSRF vulnerability, the malicious site can carry out  actions on the vulnerable site on your behalf. This is achieved by sending across the  legitimate cookie  that you created when you logged into the vulnerable site , along  with an action that requires authentication. In the worst case scenario, the vulnerable  site is your online banking, and the malicious site carries out financial transactions  on your behalf, without your knowledge, using the CSRF vulnerability. The CSRF  token mitigates against this vulnerability by adding a hidden field to every form  with a cryptographically secure set of randomly generated characters. Because the  malicious site cannot access this hidden field  even though it can access our cookies ,  we know that a POST request that includes these characters originates from our site,  and not a malicious third-party one. If you find this level of web application security  interesting, read more about the CSRF vulnerability on the Open Web Application  Security Project  OWASP  website  https:  www.owasp.org index.php Cross- Site_Request_Forgery_ CSRF  . Either way, you should always include the CSRF  field in all forms—in fact, the validation step will fail if you omit it.  [ 197 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 10   Testing the new form Because we used the same Id and name attributes for our form as we did before, our  application code for handling the processing of data when the form is submitted will  still work. Therefore, fire up the application and make sure that everything is still  working at this point. If all has gone well, the home page of the application will look  identical to when we last tested our application. You should also be able to use your  browser's 'view source' function to check that the various form fields were converted  into various HTML input types as expected.  Using WTForms in our application code The next step is to update our application code to use WTForms for catching data  that has been input through the form. Now, instead of having to remember which  "name" attributes we used, we can simply instantiate a new RegistrationForm  object and populate it from the post data received backend. We can also easily   run all our validation rules and get a list of errors for each field.  In waitercaller.py, modify the register   function to read as follows:  @app.route " register", methods=["POST"]  def register  :   form = RegistrationForm request.form    if form.validate  :     if DB.get_user form.email.data :       form.email.errors.append "Email address already registered"        return render_template 'home.html', registrationform=form      salt = PH.get_salt       hashed = PH.get_hash form.password2.data + salt      DB.add_user form.email.data, salt, hashed      return redirect url_for "home"     return render_template "home.html", registrationform=form   In the preceding code, the first change is the first line of the function. We instantiate  a new RegistrationForm and populate it by passing in the request.form object,  from which we previously pulled each field individually. As mentioned before, it's  great that we don't have to hardcode the field names now! We can instead access the  user's input data through the forms properties, such as form.email.data.  The second line is also a big change. We can call form.validate   to run all   our validation rules, and this will return True only if all the rules pass, else it will  populate the form object with all the relevant failure messages. The last line of the  function, therefore, will only get called if there are validation errors. In this case,   we now re-render our home page template, passing across a fresh copy of the form    which now has a reference to the errors. We'll see how to display these in the   next step .  [ 198 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Template Inheritance and WTForms in Waiter Caller Project   If the e-mail address is found in our database, we now append an error message to  the error messages for the e-mail field and re-render the template to pass this error  back to the frontend.  Note that previously, our three return options were all simply redirected to the home  page, made using the Flask redirect   function. Now we have replaced them all  with render_template   calls, as we need to pass the new form  with the error  messages added  along to the frontend.  Displaying errors to our user The final step for our new registration form is to display any errors to the user so  that the user can fix them and resubmit the form. To do this, we'll add some Jinja if  statements to our template to check if any errors exist in the form object and display  them if they do. Then we'll add some CSS to make these errors appear in red. Finally,  we'll look at how we could do all of this more concisely  which we'd definitely want  if we had more and larger forms . Displaying the errors in our template All we need to do to display the errors is add an if statement above each of our  input fields, checking if there are any errors to display for that field  remember  WTForms automatically populates the error lists for our form object when we run  the validate   method . If we find errors to display for that field, we need to loop  through all of them and display each one. Although, in our case, each field can only  have a single error, remember that we can add more than one validator to each field,  so it's definitely possible to have forms which have several errors for each field. We  don't want the user to have to fix one error and resubmit, only to find out that there  are still others—instead, the user would want to be informed of all errors after a  single submission of the form.  Modify the registration form in home.html to read as follows:            {% if registrationform.email.errors %}        {% for error in         registrationform.email.errors %} {{ error }}         {% endfor %}      {% endif %}      {{ registrationform.email class="form-control",       placeholder="Email Address"  }}          [ 199 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 10           {% if registrationform.password.errors %}        {% for error in         registrationform.password.errors %}         {{ error }} {% endfor %}      {% endif %}      {{ registrationform.password class="form-control",       placeholder="Password"  }}                 {% if registrationform.password2.errors %}        {% for error in         registrationform.password2.errors %}         {{ error }} {% endfor %}      {% endif %}      {{ registrationform.password2 class="form-control",       placeholder="Confirm Password"  }}        Note that we display our errors by building a list  within the   tags , and that we  assign these lists the class attribute of errors. We don't have any CSS code yet to  define what error lists should look like, so let's fix that quickly. Adding CSS for the errors The CSS code for the errors is the only custom CSS code we'll be using in the project   the rest of our CSS is all free with Bootstrap . Therefore, it's fine to add our CSS  directly into the base.html template file  we'll use it in our other templates as well ,  instead of creating a new external CSS file or editing the Bootstrap files.  If you're curious, take a look at the bootstrap.min.css file inside the static  css directory and note that it's quite difficult to read and modify  it's all in a single  line! . The reason for this is to make the page load faster—every space and newline  character makes the file a little bit bigger, which means our users' browsers would  take longer to download the CSS file that is needed to display the web page. This  is why large CSS and JavaScript libraries  such as the Bootstrap ones  come with  a minified version  this is what the 'min' in bootstrap.min.css stands for . If we  wanted to add our new CSS code to the Bootstrap file, we'd probably add it to the  non-minified version and then re-minify it to create the minified one that we'd use   in production.  [ 200 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Template Inheritance and WTForms in Waiter Caller Project   Add the following style between the   tags of the base.html file:      ul.errors {     list-style-type: none;     padding: 0;     color: red;   }    The first line in the preceding styling code means that it should only apply to    elements which have a class of errors  that is, the feedback messages we just added  to our home page . The next three lines remove the bullet point that lists use by  default, remove the indent that lists use by default, and set the font color to red.  Testing the final registration form Our registration form is now finished. It now uses WTForms, so it is cleaner and  easier to maintain, and we don't have to rely on a developer knowing that the HTML  name attribute has to match up with the Python code. Let's have a look to make sure  everything still works and that our new error messages are displayed when we  expect them to be and are not shown when we don't want them.  Run your application again and try to register a new account. Try out various  combinations of errors, such as using an already registered e-mail address   remember that our test database is cleared every time we restart the application ,  using a password that is too short, using non-matching strings for the two password  fields, or using an invalid e-mail address. If all has gone according to plan, your form  with errors should look similar to the one below:  [ 201 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 10   There are a couple of interesting things to note about the last image. First, note  that the e-mail address g@1 is taken to be valid by the HTML5 input box  frontend  validation , but not by the Email   validator  backend validation . This is why I  could submit the form even though I'm using a browser that supports the HTML5  e-mail field, and was only told that the e-mail address was invalid after the data  went to the backend. Second, note that after the form was submitted, the e-mail  address was repopulated automatically, while the password fields are now blank.  This is a useful default of most browsers. We are likely to want to submit similar  information the second time round, after fixing the errors, but for security reasons,  we always want to get rid of passwords as quickly as possible. Note the 'Invalid email address.' message in the preceding image. In our forms.py  file, we only specified the error message for the case when the password was   too short, but WTForms provides default messages for its built-in validators.  Similarly, if you leave the password field blank, you'll see the message   'This field is required'—another useful default that we did not have to write. That's most of the heavy lifting done for form validation and user feedback.   Now that you have a good conceptual grasp of how everything works, we'll go   over it quickly once:     Displaying feedback when the user's registration is successful  at the   moment, we rather pessimistically only seem to be confirmed with failure,  but the user will want to know that an account has been successfully  registered if everything goes well .     Moving our login form to WTForms and adding feedback for when users       Moving our 'new table' form to WTForms and adding feedback    fail to log in.  where necessary.  Adding a successful registration notification Normally, we would show the user a new page after a successful registration,  thanking them for registering and informing them that everything has been  successful  see the next chapter for a more complete list of things we could improve  on if we were writing this application for a production environment instead of using  it as an educational project . To keep our application to as few pages as possible, and  to prevent this book from growing too long, we'll show the user a JavaScript popup  box instead. Generally, when creating user interfaces, we want to avoid as many  popups as possible, as users find them irritating. However, they are occasionally  necessary, so using one here will help keep our application simple and give us an  opportunity to learn a bit more JavaScript.  [ 202 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Template Inheritance and WTForms in Waiter Caller Project   JavaScript is event-based. This means that we can write code that is triggered by  user actions  such as a mouse click  or other events such as an 'onload' event, which  is triggered when a specific resource loads in the user's browser. Previously, in our  Crime Map project, we used this to initialize the JavaScript Google Map widget after  the   tag had loaded. Now we'll do something similar, but use this to display a  JavaScript alert box instead. We'll also make our message dynamic and pass it to the  frontend from the backend code. Passing the message from the application code The backend change for this is easy. Simply change the register   function to   pass in the appropriate message if we process all the input data without any errors.  In waitercaller.py, update the register   function to read as follows:  hashed = PH.get_hash form.password2.data + salt  DB.add_user form.email.data, salt, hashed  return render_template "home.html", registrationform=form,   onloadmessage="Registration successful. Please log in."   return render_template "home.html", registrationform=form   Using the message in the template code The change is slightly trickier to implement in our template because we don't  actually have access to the   tag  where we want to specify the JavaScript  alert  in our home.html template. Instead, our   is defined in our base.html  skeleton template from which all our other templates inherit.  To modify the   tag only in our home.html template, we need to make   the   tag appear within an inheritable Jinja block, similar to our content   block. To do this, we need to make changes to our base.html template and to   our home.html template.  In base.html, make the following change where the   tag is created:        {% block bodytag %}        {% endblock %}  [ 203 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 10   Now the   tag can be overwritten by child templates, as it appears inside a  configurable block. In home.html, we'll overwrite the   block directly after  the first line, if an alert message is specified. Remember that if this message is not  specified, the home.html template will simply inherit the default   tag from  the base.html template. In home.html, add the following code directly after the   first line:  {% block bodytag %}   <body {% if onloadmessage %} onload="alert '{{onloadmessage}}' ;" {%  endif %}> {% endblock %}  The only slightly tricky part is matching up all the quotation marks and brackets  in the onload attribute. The entire alert function  the JavaScript we want to run   should appear within double quotation marks. The string inside the alert function   the message that is actually displayed to the user  should be inside single quotation  marks. Finally, the onloadmessage variable should be inside double braces, so that  we get the contents of the variable rather than the string of the variable name.  Now, after a successful registration, the user will see an alert confirming that  everything went well and that a login is possible, as seen in the following image.  It would be better to add a new page to properly inform the user of the successful  registration, but to keep our app simple  and so we could introduce the onload  functionality, which is generally useful , we opted for a slightly messier way of  communicating this.  [ 204 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Template Inheritance and WTForms in Waiter Caller Project   Modifying the login form The changes necessary to move the login form to WTForms are very similar to the  changes we made for the registration form, so we'll provide the code with minimal  discussion. Refer to the code bundle if you are unsure where to insert the code or  make changes.  Creating the new LoginForm in the application code In forms.py, add the LoginForm class:  class LoginForm Form :     loginemail = EmailField 'email',       validators=[validators.DataRequired  , validators.Email  ]      loginpassword = PasswordField 'password',       validators=[validators.      DataRequired message="Password field is required" ]      submit = SubmitField 'submit', [validators.DataRequired  ]   Here we specify a custom message for the password field's DataRequired validator,  as the error messages won't align with the fields as nicely as they did for the  registration form. We also use the variable names loginemail and loginpassword,  as these will become the HTML element id and name attributes, and it's preferable  that they don't get overridden by the login and password fields in the registration  form on the same page.  In waitercaller.py, add the import for the login form:  from forms import LoginForm  And rewrite the login   function as follows:  @app.route " login", methods=["POST"]  def login  :     form = LoginForm request.form      if form.validate  :         stored_user = DB.get_user form.loginemail.data          if stored_user and           PH.validate_password form.loginpassword.data,           stored_user['salt'], stored_user['hashed'] :             user = User form.loginemail.data              login_user user, remember=True              return redirect url_for 'account'           form.loginemail.errors.append "Email or password invalid"      return render_template "home.html", loginform=form,       registrationform=RegistrationForm     [ 205 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 10   It may seem that the "Email or password invalid" error is quite vague and could be  more specific. It's true that the user may find it helpful to know where the mistake  lies, as many people use many different e-mail addresses and different passwords.  Thus, it would be convenient to know whether you, as a user, have entered the wrong  e-mail and need to try to remember which e-mail address you signed up for, or if you  have the correct e-mail address and have misremembered your anniversary or date  of birth or whatever mnemonic you use to remember your password. However, the  convenience is offset by yet another security issue. If we display "Invalid password"  when the user enters a correct e-mail address but the incorrect password, this would  allow a malicious attacker to try a large list of e-mail addresses against our website,  and slowly build up a list of e-mail addresses that belong to our users. The attacker  could then target these users in a phishing attack by using the knowledge that these  users are our customers. This is yet another case that shows how developers have to  be constantly vigilant against what information they might be allowing an attacker to  infer, even if it's not directly provided.  The last backend changes that we need to make are to initialize and pass in a new  LoginForm object whenever we render the home.html template. These changes have  to be made:      Once in the home   function    Three times in the register   function  Change the home   function to read as follows:  @app.route " "  def home  :   return render_template "home.html",     loginform=LoginForm  , registrationform=RegistrationForm     Change the last two lines of the register   function to:    return render_template "home.html", loginform=LoginForm  ,     registrationform=form, onloadmessage="Registration successful.     Please log in."    return render_template "home.html", loginform=LoginForm  ,     registrationform=form   And the return statement in the middle of the register   function to:    return render_template "home.html", loginform=LoginForm  ,     registrationform=form   [ 206 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Template Inheritance and WTForms in Waiter Caller Project   Using the new LoginForm in the template For the template changes, home.html should now use the following login form:  <form class="navbar-form navbar-right" action=" login"   method="POST">   {% if loginform.errors %}             {% for field_name, field_errors in loginform.errorsdictsort         if field_errors %}         {% for error in field_errors %}            {{ error }}          {% endfor %}       {% endfor %}         {% endif %}   {{ loginform.csrf_token}}         {{ loginform.email class="form-control", placeholder="Email       Address" }}             {{ loginform.password class="form-control",       placeholder="Password" }}             {{ loginform.submit value="Sign in",       class="btn btn-success" }}        Instead of displaying the errors above each field, as we did for the registration form,  we'll just display all the errors above the login form. To do this, we can use the  loginform.errors property, which is a dictionary mapping of each field to a list of  its errors. The error displaying code is therefore slightly more verbose, as it has to  loop through all the keys and values of this dictionary, and we use the convenient  dictsort Jinja notation to sort the dictionary before displaying the errors.  [ 207 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 10   Modifying the create table form The last form change we need to make is to the create table form, for when   an already logged-in user adds a new restaurant table to his or her account.   The new form to be added to forms.py looks like this:  class CreateTableForm Form :   tablenumber = TextField 'tablenumber',       validators=[validators.DataRequired  ]    submit = SubmitField 'createtablesubmit',       validators=[validators.DataRequired  ]   This requires a new import in forms.py as well:  from wtforms import TextField  In waitercaller.py, we need to import the new form with:  from forms import CreateTableForm  Update the account_createtable   function to:  @app.route " account createtable", methods=["POST"]  @login_required def account_createtable  :   form = CreateTableForm request.form    if form.validate  :     tableid = DB.add_table form.tablenumber.data,         current_user.get_id        new_url = BH.shorten_url config.base_url + "newrequest " +         tableid      DB.update_table tableid, new_url      return redirect url_for 'account'      return render_template "account.html", createtableform=form,       tables=DB.get_tables current_user.get_id      And the account   route to:  @app.route " account"  @login_required def account  :     tables = DB.get_tables current_user.get_id        return render_template "account.html",         createtableform=CreateTableForm  , tables=tables   [ 208 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Template Inheritance and WTForms in Waiter Caller Project   Finally, the form in the account.html template should be changed to:  <form class="form-inline" action=" account createtable"   method="POST">         {% if createtableform.tablenumber.errors %}                  {% for error in createtableform.tablenumber.errors %}            {{error}}           {% endfor %}               {% endif %}     {{ createtableform.csrf_token}}     {{ createtableform.tablenumber class="form-control",         placeholder="Table number or name" }}     {{ createtableform.submit value="Create",         class="btn btn-primary"  }}        At the moment, if the user leaves the field blank and hits the Create button, we can  only ever have a single error displayed on the create table form, that is, 'This field  is required', which we can see in the following screenshot:  With this in mind, it is debatable whether the for loop should loop through all the  error messages. On the one hand, it is bad to 'future proof' too much, as you are left  with a code base that contains a lot of unnecessary code that is over complicated.   On the other hand, we may well add more error messages to the WTForm  such as   if the user tries to create a table with a number that already exists , and therefore,   it is arguably worthwhile to add the for loop.  [ 209 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 10   The one form left that we have not converted to WTForms is the delete table form.  As this is only a single Submit button, it is left as an exercise  the CSRF protection  would still be a worthwhile gain in moving this form to WTForms. .  Summary We've fleshed out our application's functionality, and it's now a lot more powerful.  We added Dashboard and Account pages, and wrote all the application code,  database code, and frontend code to handle our requirements.  We looked at Jinja templates as a way to avoid duplicating the frontend code,   and we also looked at how to use the bitly API to shorten links.  We then added WTForms, and saw how this could make our user feedback easier,  our forms easier to validate, and our web application more secure. Our users are  now kept up-to-date with information about their registration, login, and usage of  the application.  In the next chapter, we'll add a real database to our code and then work on some  finishing touches.  [ 210 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Template Inheritance and WTForms in Waiter Caller Project   Using MongoDB with Our  Waiter Caller Project  Our web application now has nearly all of its functionality. If we plan to monetize  this application, now would be the time where we'd demo it to potential customers.  Even though their data  such as their account name and virtual table data  would be  lost every time we had to restart our server, this data is trivial enough to make a full  demo of the application feasible.  In this chapter, we will add a proper database for use in production. We'll use  MongoDB—a slightly controversial NoSQL database management system that  has become extremely popular, arguably largely because of its simplicity. We'll  take a look at how to install in on our VPS, configure it correctly, and access it  using a Python driver. Then, we'll implement the full DBHelper class to replace  MockDBHelper, which we use for testing. To end off, we'll look at adding indices   to MongoDB and a favicon to our application.  In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:  Introducing MongoDB Installing MongoDB           Using the MongoDB shell       Adding some finishing touches  Introducing PyMongo  [ 211 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Introducing MongoDB MongoDB is a NoSQL database. This means that unlike the MySQL database we  used for our Crime Map project, it is not organized into tables, rows, and columns;  instead, it is organized into collections, documents, and fields. While it can be useful  to think of these new terms as a sort of translation from those we use for relational  databases, the concepts do not perfectly translate. If you have a background in  relational databases, a useful and more complete reference to these translations can  be found on the official MongoDB website at https:  docs.mongodb.org manual  reference sql-comparison .  MongoDB's structure is much more flexible than that of a SQL database—not all of  our data has to confirm to a specific schema, and this can save development time.  For our Crime Map project, we had to spend time up front looking at our data and  deciding how to represent it in a database. We then had to set up a bunch of fields,  specifying the data type, length, and other constraints. MongoDB, by contrast,  requires none of this. It's more flexible than an RDBMS, and it uses documents to  represent the data. Documents are essentially bits of JSON data similar to the data  we pulled from the APIs we used. This means that we can easily add or remove  fields as necessary, and we do not need to specify data types for our fields.  The downside of this is that by not being forced to be structured and consistent, it's  easy for us to get lazy and fall into bad practices of mixing different data types in a  single field and allowing invalid data to pollute our database. In short, MongoDB  gives us more freedom, but in doing so, it shifts some of the responsibility for being  clean and consistent onto our shoulders.  Installing MongoDB MongoDB can be found in the Ubuntu software repositories, but as updates are  frequent and the repository versions tend to lag behind, it's highly recommended to  install it from the official Mongo package directly.  We'll go through how to do this step by step here, but as the installation procedures  may change, it's advisable to get an updated version of the required URLs and  steps from the official installation guide available at https:  docs.mongodb.org  manual tutorial install-mongodb-on-ubuntu .  The first thing we need to do is import MongoDB's public key so that the installation  can be authenticated. On your VPS only  as before, we will not install a database  server on our development machine , run the following:  sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp:  keyserver.ubuntu.com:80   --recv EA312927  [ 212 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Using MongoDB with Our Waiter Caller Project   Now that we have the key, we can use the following command to add a link to the  MongoDB package to our software sources. Note that this command is specific to  Ubuntu 14.04 "Trusty", which, at the time of writing, is the latest long-term support  Ubuntu version. If your VPS runs a different version of Ubuntu, make sure you get  the correct command from the MongoDB documentation link provided earlier. To  discover which version of Ubuntu you have, run lsb_release -a in your terminal  and examine the output for a version number and name:  echo "deb http:  repo.mongodb.org apt ubuntu trusty mongodb-org 3.2   multiverse"  sudo tee  etc apt sources.list.d mongodb-org-3.2.list  Now, we simply need to update our source lists by running:  sudo apt-get update  Finally, do the actual installation by running the following command:  sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org  The preceding command will install MongoDB with some sensible defaults and  start the server. It'll also configure it in such a way that the server will start up  automatically if you reboot your VPS.  Using the MongoDB shell Similarly to what we discussed with MySQL, MongoDB comes with a simple shell.  This is ideal to run quick, one-off commands and get used to the syntax. Let's run  through the basic CRUD operations to get familiar with how MongoDB works.  As in our previous project, once we introduce MongoDB, we'll move to using it  only through Python code; however, to start out, we'll write commands directly in  the shell. This means there will be some slight differences in syntax, but as nearly  everything is JSON based, these differences shouldn't be a problem.  Starting the MongoDB shell To start the MongoDB shell, run the following command on your VPS:  mongo  [ 213 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 11   This will start the interactive MongoDB shell as in the following image, which   you can exit at any time by pressing Ctrl + C or by typing exit into the shell and  pressing Enter.  Running commands in the MongoDB shell As with MySQL, the top-level concept in MongoDB is a database. By default, this  will connect to a database named test. We can change databases using the use  command. Run the following command in the shell:  use sandbox  You should see the output "Switched to db sandbox". This is where we can note the  first big difference between MySQL and MongoDB. With MySQL, we would first  have had to create the database. This is a common pattern we'll see with MongoDB;  if you reference a database, collection, or field that doesn't exist, it'll be automatically  created for you.  Creating data with MongoDB Now, let's create a collection  similar to a table in our MySQL database from the  Crime Map project  and add a document  as with a row from a table in our MySQL  database  to it. Run the following in the MongoDB shell:  db.people.insert {"name":"John Smith", "age": 35}   In the preceding command, db refers to the current database. Directly after, people  refers to the collection called of this name. As it doesn't exist, it'll get created as we  attempt to use it. Following this is insert, which means we want to add something  to the database. We will pass as an argument  inside round the brackets , which is a  JSON structure. In our case, we represented a person with a JSON object containing  the person's name and age. Note that everything is in quotation marks except for the  value of the age field; again, unlike MySQL, we don't have to specify the types for  this data. MongoDB will store the name as a string and the age as an integer, but it  applies no restrictions to these fields.  [ 214 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Using MongoDB with Our Waiter Caller Project   Add another person to the database to make the next operations that we will try out  more meaningful. Run the following:  db.people.insert {"name":"Mary Jones"}   Reading data with MongoDB Instead of the SQL concept of a SELECT statement, MongoDB uses a find    command. Similarly to SQL, we can specify the criteria to search for in data and also  choose which fields we want the database to return. Run the following command:  db.people.find    This is the most basic version of the find operation. It'll simply find or retrieve all the  data and all its fields from the people collection. You should see MongoDB output  all the information about both the people we just added. You'll note that each person  also has an ObjectId field added; MongoDB adds unique identifier fields to each of  our documents automatically, and these ID fields are also automatically indexed.  We can also use find with a single argument. The argument specifies criteria, and  MongoDB only returns documents that match. Run the following command:  db.people.find {"name":"John Smith"}   This will return all the fields from all the records if the name matches John Smith, so  you should see a single result returned and printed to the shell, as in the screenshot  that follows:  Finally, if we don't want all the fields returned, we can run the find command  and pass in a second argument to specify which fields we want. Run the following  command, and you should see results as in the following screenshot:  db.people.find {"name":"John Smith"}, {"age":1}   [ 215 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 11   The first argument says we're only interested in people who are called "John Smith".  The second argument says we're only interested in their age. Here, 1 is a flag that  says we want this field. We could instead use 0 to say that we're not interested in a  field, in which case, all the fields will be returned except this one.  Note that even though we said we were only interested in the age field, the preceding  command returned the _id field as well. The _id field is always returned unless  explicitly excluded. For example, we could run the following:  db.people.find {"name":"John Smith"}, {"age":1, "_id": 0}   This will return only John's age and nothing else. Also, note that the key for the _id  field is _id and not id; this is to prevent a conflict with the id keyword in many  programming languages, including Python.  Each of our examples used very basic JSON objects with only a single value, but we  can specify multiple values for each argument. Consider the difference between the  following commands:  db.people.find {"name":"John Smith", "age":1}   db.people.find {"name":"John Smith"}, {"age":1}   The first command uses find with a single argument that returns all records for all  the people with the name John Smith and aged 1. The second command uses find  with two arguments and returns the age field  and _id field  of all the people with  the name John Smith.  A final difference to note from MySQL is that there is no need to commit new   data. Once we run the insert statement, the data will be in the database until   we remove it.  Updating data with MongoDB Updating existing records is slightly more complicated. MongoDB provides an  update method, which can be called in the same way as insert and find. It also  takes two arguments—the first specifying the criteria to find the document we want  to update, and the second providing a new document to replace it with. Run the  following command:  db.people.update {"name":"John Smith"},   {"name":"John Smith", "age":43}   [ 216 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Using MongoDB with Our Waiter Caller Project   This finds the person with the name John Smith, and replaces him with a new  person, also with the name John Smith and aged 43. If there are a lot of fields and  we only want to change a single one, it is tedious and wasteful to recreate all the  old fields. Therefore, we can use MongoDB's $set keyword instead, which will  only replace the specified fields inside a document instead of replacing the whole  document. Run the following command:  db.people.update {"name":"John Smith"}, {$set: {"age":35}}   This updates John's age back to 35 again, which is probably a relief to him. Instead  of having to overwrite the whole document, here we only changed the age field.  We did this using the $set keyword in the second argument. Note that the update  function still takes two arguments and the second one now has a nested JSON  structure—the out JSON object has $set as the key and another JSON object as a  value. The inner JSON object specifies the updates that we want to make.  Deleting data with MongoDB Deleting data is as easy as finding it. We will simply use the remove function instead  of find and then specify the matching criteria in a single argument, just as we would  with find. Run the following command to delete John from our database:  db.people.remove {"name":"John Smith"}   You will see a confirmation that one record was deleted, as shown in the   following image:  You can also check that John is deleted by running the following:  db.people.find    Now, only Mary will be returned, as in the following image:  To remove all the documents from a collection, we can pass in an empty argument.  Run the following command to remove all the remaining people:  db.people.remove {}   [ 217 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 11   Here, {} specifies an empty criteria condition and therefore matches all the  documents. Check that our people collection is empty by running the find  command again, as follows:  db.people.find    You'll see no output, as shown in the following screenshot  with the earlier examples  included for context , because our people collection is now empty:  Now that we looked at the basics of MongoDB, let's take a look at how to run similar  commands using Python instead of operating through the shell.  Introducing PyMongo PyMongo is a library that implements drivers for MongoDB and will allow us to  execute commands on our database from our application code. As usual, install it  through pip using the following command  note that, similarly to MongoDB, you  only need to install this library on the server :  pip install --user pymongo  Now, we can import this library into our application and build our real DBHelper  class, implementing all the methods we used in our MockDBHelper class.  Writing the DBHelper class The last class that we need is the DBHelper class, which will contain all the functions  that are required for our application code to talk to our database. This class will use  the pymongo library we just installed in order to run MongoDB commands. Create a  file named dbhelper.py in the waiter directory and add the following code:  import pymongo  DATABASE = "waitercaller"  [ 218 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Using MongoDB with Our Waiter Caller Project   class DBHelper:    def __init__ self :     client = pymongo.MongoClient       self.db = client[DATABASE]  This code imports the pymongo library, and in the constructor, it creates a client—a  Python object that will let us run the CRUD operations we tried out earlier on our  database. We defined the name of our database as a global one, and in the second  line of our constructor, we connected to the specified database using client.  Adding the user methods For user management, we need the same two functions we had in our mock class.  The first is to get a user out of the database  in order to log this user in  and the  second is to add new users to the database  in order to register new users . Add the  following two methods to the DBHelper class:      def get_user self, email :         return self.db.users.find_one {"email": email}       def add_user self, email, salt, hashed :         self.db.users.insert {"email": email, "salt": salt,           "hashed": hashed}   For the first method, we used PyMongo's find_one   function. This is similar to  the find   method we used in the MongoDB shell but returns only a single match  instead of all the matching results. As we only allow one registration per e-mail  address, there will always be either one or zero matches. Using find   instead of  find_one   here would also work, but we would get back a Python generator that  produces a single or zero element. Using find_one  , we will get back either a  single user result or none, which is exactly what our login code needs.  For the add_user   method, we used insert   exactly as we discussed when  playing with the MongoDB shell and inserted a new document containing the   e-mail address, salt, and salted hash of the password.  Adding the table methods We need methods to handle the following cases for the virtual tables that our users  will create:     One to add new tables    One to update tables  so that we can add the shortened bitly URL   [ 219 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 11      One to get all the tables  so that we can display them in the Account page     One to get a single table  so that we can add the local table number to    our requests      One to delete a table  This is a nice set of methods as it demonstrates all four of the CRUD database  operations. Add the following code to the DBHelper class:  def add_table self, number, owner :     new_id = self.db.tables.insert {"number": number, "owner":       owner}      return new_id  def update_table self, _id, url :     self.db.tables.update {"_id": _id}, {"$set": {"url": url}}   def get_tables self, owner_id :     return list self.db.tables.find {"owner": owner_id}    def get_table self, table_id :     return self.db.tables.find_one {"_id": ObjectId table_id }   def delete_table self, table_id :     self.db.tables.remove {"_id": ObjectId table_id }   For the add_table   method, MongoDB will assign a unique identifier every time  we insert a table. This gives us true multiuser support. Our mock code used the   user-chosen table number as a unique identifier and would break with multiple users  when two or more users chose the same table number. In the add_table   method,  we returned this unique identifier to the application code, which can then be used to  build the URL that's needed to make new requests for this specific table.  The update_table   method uses the insert   function that we discussed earlier.  As in our previous example, we used the $set keyword to keep our original data  intact, and only edited a specific field  instead of overwriting the entire document .  Note that unlike in the MongoDB shell example, we now need  quotation marks around $set; this makes it syntactically legal Python  code  all the keys of a dictionary have to be strings , and PyMongo  takes care of the magic in the background to convert our Python  dictionaries into MongoDB commands and objects.  [ 220 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Using MongoDB with Our Waiter Caller Project   The get_tables   function used the find   function instead of the find_one    function that we used for the user code. This caused PyMongo to return a Python  generator that can produce all the data that matched the find criteria. As we assumed  that we'll always be able to load all the tables into memory, we converted this  generator to a list, which we then passed to our template.  The get_table   function is used in cases when we only have access to the table ID  and need to get other information about the table. This is exactly the scenario when  we processed requests; the URL of the request contained the table's unique ID but  wanted to add the table number to the Dashboard page. The unique identifiers that  MongoDB generated are actually objects rather than simple strings, but we had just  the string from our URL. Therefore, we created ObjectId and passed in the string  before using this ID to query the database. ObjectId can be imported from the bson  library, which was installed automatically. This means we also need to add another  import statement. Add the following line to the top of the dbhelper.py file:  from bson.objectid import ObjectId  Finally, the delete_table   method used the remove   function exactly as we did  before. Here, we removed a table by its unique identifier, so again, we created an  ObjectId object from the string we had before passing it to the database.  Adding the request methods We have to add the last three methods to the DBHelper class to deal with the  attention requests. We need to:     Add a request when a patron visits the provided URL    Get all the requests for a specific user to display on the Dashboard page    Delete requests from the database when the user hits the Resolve button  Add the following methods to the dbhelper.py file:      def add_request self, table_id, time :         table = self.get_table table_id          self.db.requests.insert {"owner": table['owner'],           "table_number": table['number'],          "table_id": table_id, "time": time}       def get_requests self, owner_id :         return list self.db.requests.find {"owner": owner_id}        def delete_request self, request_id :         self.db.requests.remove {"_id": ObjectId request_id }   [ 221 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 11   Changing the application code Now that we have a real DBHelper class, we need to conditionally import it based on  which environment we're in. Change the import for the MockDBHelper class in the  waitercaller.py file to read, as follows:  if config.test     from mockdbhelper import MockDBHelper as DBHelper else:     from dbhelper import DBHelper  Ensure that the preceding four lines are added beneath the config import.  Also, our DBHelper class deals mainly with many instances of ObjectId, while   our MockDBHelper class uses strings. We therefore need a small change to our  account_createtable   function to cast ObjectId to a string. Take a look at   the line in waitercaller.py that reads the following:  new_url = BH.shorten_url config.base_url +   "newrequest " + tableid   Now, change this to the following:  new_url = BH.shorten_url config.base_url +   "newrequest " + str tableid    This will ensure that tableid is always a string before we concatenate it to our URL.  The last code changes we need for our production is a different config file to specify  the correct base_url for our VPS and to indicate that the MockDBHelper class should  not be used. As we don't check our config file into our git repository, we'll need to  create this directly on the VPS.  Testing our application in production Our application should now be fully functional once we add the preceding code! As  with the database section of our Crime Map application, this bit is the most delicate  as we haven't been able to test the DBHelper code locally, and we'll have to debug it  directly on the VPS. However, we're confident, from our MockDBHelper class, that all  our application logic is working, and if the new database code holds up, everything  else should go as expected. Let's push our code to the server and test it out.  Locally, run the following commands in your waitercaller directory:  git add .  git commit -m "DBHelper code"  git push origin master  [ 222 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Using MongoDB with Our Waiter Caller Project   On your VPS, change to the WaiterCaller directory, pull the new code, and restart  Apache, as follows:  cd  var www waitercaller  git pull origin master  Now, create the production config file using nano by running the following  command:  nano config.py  Type the following into the new config.py file, substituting the IP address   in base_url with the IP address of your VPS.  test = False  base_url = "http:  123.456.789.123   Then, save and quit the file by hitting Ctrl + X and entering Y when prompted.  Now, run the following command to reload Apache with the new code:  sudo service apache2 reload   Visit the IP address of your VPS in your local browser and do a run-through of  all the functionality to make sure everything works as expected. This includes  attempting to sign up with invalid data, signing up, attempting to log in with invalid  data, logging in, creating a table, creating a request, viewing the dashboard, waiting  for the dashboard to refresh, resolving a request, and more. For a full test, all the  actions should be completed several times in varying combinations.  You'll probably understand how tedious this gets even for our relatively simple  application. For more complicated applications, it is well worth the effort to create  automatic tests—code that imitates what a user would do on the site but also has  built-in expectations of what should happen at each step. Tools such as Selenium   www.seleniumhq.org  come in very useful to build such tests.  As always, if anything goes wrong or you get the dreaded "500: Internal  Server Error", check the Apache error file at  etc log apache2  error.log for hints.  Adding some finishing touches To end off, we'll add a couple of indices to our database to improve efficiency and  prevent multiple requests from being open for a single table. After this, we'll add a  favicon to personalize our web application.  [ 223 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 11   Adding indices to MongoDB Database indices are used to increase efficiency. Normally, to find a subset of  documents in our database that match certain criteria  that is, whenever we use the  MongoDB find   method , the database engine has to examine each record and  add the ones that match the returned result. If we add an index to a specific field, the  database will store more metadata, which can be thought about as storing a sorted  copy of this field. To find out whether john@example.com appears in a sorted list is  much more efficient than checking whether it appears in an unsorted list. However,  the indices do take up additional storage space, so choosing where to add indices is  a classic space-time tradeoff that's seen everywhere in computer science. MongoDB can  also use indices to place some constraints on a field. In our case, we'll use a unique  index, which prevents a new document from being added to the database if the value  for the indexed field already appears in another document in this collection. We'll add two indices to MongoDB. We'll add an index on the email field of our  users collection as we will use this field to find users on login, and we want the  lookups to be as fast as possible. We also want to ensure at a database level that each  e-mail address is unique. We already have two checks for this: the HTML5 field  does a frontend check, and our application code does a backend check. Even though  a database check may seem unnecessary, it takes little effort to set up and follows  the good principles of baked-in security  in which checks aren't just tacked on as an  afterthought, but all data is validated as often as possible instead , and the principle  that each layer of an application  the frontend, application layer, and database layer  in our case  shouldn't blindly trust the data that is passed from a higher layer. We'll also add a unique index on the table_id field for a requests collection.   This will prevent a single impatient table from spamming the dashboard with  multiple requests by refreshing the page that creates a new request. It's also useful  because our requests are created using GET requests, which can easily be duplicated   by a browser preloading a page or a social network scraping the links a user visits to  find out more about them . By ensuring that each request's table_id is unique, we  can prevent both of these issues. Where do we add indices? When we built our MySQL database, we had a setup script that ran independently of  our Crime Map web application. This setup script built the skeleton of the database,  and we wrote it in Python so that we could easily run it again if we ever needed to  migrate to a new server or to reinstall our database. As MongoDB is so much more flexible, we didn't need a setup script. We can start  our application off on a new server, and—as long as we install MongoDB—the  database will recreate itself from scratch as new data is added or the old data is  restored from a backup.  [ 224 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Using MongoDB with Our Waiter Caller Project   The lack of a setup script does mean that we don't really have a good place to add  indices to our database. If we add the indices through the MongoDB shell, it means  that someone has to remember to add them again if the application needs to migrate  to a new server. Therefore, we'll create an independent Python script just to make the  indices. On your local machine, create a Python file in the waitercaller directory  and call it create_mongo_indices.py. Add the following code:  import pymongo client = pymongo.MongoClient   c = client['waitercaller'] print c.users.create_index "email", unique=True  print c.requests.create_index "table_id", unique=True   The connection code is the same that we used before, and the code used to create  indices is simple enough. We called the create_index   method on the collection  we want to create an index on and then passed in the field name to use to create the  index. In our case, we also passed in the unique=True flag to specify that the indices  should also have a unique constraint added to them.  Now, we need to make a small change to our application so that it can deal with the  case of a new request being made when an identical request is already open. In the  dbhelper.py file, update the add_request   method to the following:      def add_request self, table_id, time :         table = self.get_table table_id          try:             self.db.requests.insert {"owner": table['owner'],               "table_number": table['number'], "table_id": table_id,               "time": time}              return True         except pymongo.errors.DuplicateKeyError:             return False  If we try to insert a request into our database with a duplicate table_id field,  DuplicateKeyError will be thrown. In the updated code, we will catch this error  and return False to indicate that the request wasn't successfully created. We will  also now return True when the request is successful. To take advantage of this  information in the application code, we also need to update the new_request    method. Edit the method so that it looks similar to this:  @app.route " newrequest  "  def new_request tid :         if DB.add_request tid, datetime.datetime.now   :             return "Your request has been logged and a waiter will               be with you shortly"         return "There is already a request pending for this table.           Please be patient, a waiter will be there ASAP"  [ 225 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 11   Now, we will check whether the new request was successfully created or whether  an existing one blocked it. In the latter case, we will return a different message,  requesting patience from the patron.  To test the new functionality, add the new and modified files to Git  waitercaller. py, dbhelper.py, create_mongo_indices.py , commit, and then push them.   On your VPS, pull in the new changes, restart Apache, and run the following:  python create_mongo_indices.py  To create the indices we discussed before, run some tests again in your browser to  make sure nothing broke and to verify that you get the new message displayed when  you visit the same attention request URL repeatedly without resolving the request,  as in the screenshot that follows:  You may find that, due to your browser pre-fetching pages, attention requests get  made automatically when you first create tables through the account page. If you see  the message as displayed in the above image when you don't expect to, resolve any  open requests on the dashboard page, and visit the newrequest URL again.  Adding a favicon The last thing we'll add to our application is a favicon. Favicons are the small images  that most browsers display in the tab bar when a page is open and on the bookmarks  bar if a user bookmarks a site. They add a friendly touch to the site and help a user  identify a site more quickly.  The tricky part about favicons is that they have to be really small. It's customary  to use a 16x16 pixel image as a favicon—which doesn't leave that much room for  creativity. There are some nice websites to help you create the perfect favicon for  your website. One such site is favicon.cc, which allows you to create a favicon  from scratch  giving you 16x16 blank pixels to start , or it can import an image.   Using the import functionality, you can use a bigger image that favicon.cc  attempts to reduce to 16x16 pixels—this has mixed results and generally works   better with simpler images. An example favicon is included in the code bundle   in the static directory, and an enlarged version of it is shown in the following image:  [ 226 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Using MongoDB with Our Waiter Caller Project   Once you have an icon  you can use the one provided in the code bundle , it's  easy to tell Flask to serve it along with the rest of the page. Make sure your icon is  called favicon.ico  the standard extension for icon files is .ico  and put it in the  waitercaller static directory. Then, add the following line to the   section  of the base.html template:  <link rel="shortcut icon" href="{{ url_for 'static',   filename='favicon.ico'  }}">  This creates a link to the favicon.ico file using Jinja's url_for function to generate  the full URL needed to be directed to the static directory, which is simply converted  to the plain HTML  which you can see by hitting View source in your browser .   Take a look at the following:     Now, if you reload the page again, you will see the favicon in the tab heading, and  if you bookmark the page, you'll view the icon in the bookmarks toolbar of your  browser as well, as seen in the following screenshot:  [ 227 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Chapter 11   That's it for our last project. Of course, no web application is ever truly complete, and  there are countless improvements to make and features to add. By this stage in the  book, you will have more than enough knowledge to start adding your own changes  and bringing your original ideas into creation, either as extensions to the projects we  walked through in this book or from scratch, as brand-new web applications.  Summary In this chapter, we completed our Waiter Caller web application. We installed  MongoDB on our server, learned how to use it through the shell, and then installed  PyMongo. Using PyMongo, we created a new database helper class to allow our  application code to run operations on the new database.  Finally, we added a favicon to make our web application friendlier and more  aesthetically pleasing to users.  In the next and final chapter, we'll take a look at what could still be added to our  application to improve usability and security and end with some pointers on where  to look next to continue learning about Flask and web development through Python.  [ 228 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Using MongoDB with Our Waiter Caller Project   A Sneak Peek into the Future  We covered quite a variety of topics in this book, and we walked through the  building of three functional and useful web applications. However, books, by nature,  are of a finite length, while the world of web development tends towards the infinite,  so we couldn't add everything. In this final chapter, we'll take a whistle-stop tour  around the technologies that we weren't able to cover in detail. We'll start with  looking at technologies that could be used directly to expand or improve the projects  we created in this book. Then, we'll look at some more advanced Flask features that  we didn't need to use in our projects but which will almost certainly be useful in  other projects. Finally, we'll have a brief discussion of the technologies that are useful  for web development in general but are not specific to either the projects we built  here or to Flask.  Expanding the projects The projects we built are all functional, but they are not quite ready for heavy,  real-time use. If they were to be built out to handle thousands of users or were  commercial applications, they would need a few more features. These are discussed  in the following sections.  Adding a domain name We accessed all of our projects using the IP address of our VPS. You're almost  certainly used to visiting web applications using domain names rather than IP  addresses. When you use a domain name, such as http:  google.com, your  browser first sends off a request to a DNS server to find out what the IP address  associated with this domain is. DNS servers are similar to huge automatic telephone  books that exist solely to translate the domain names that humans find easier to  remember  such as http:  google.com  in than the IP addresses that organize the  Internet  for example, 123.456.789.123 .  [ 229 ]  www.it-ebooks.info   To use a domain name instead of the IP address, you need to purchase one from a  registrar. Often your Internet Service Provider  ISP  can assist you with purchasing  a domain name  such as yourname.com . Domain names are normally fairly  inexpensive, and you can get them for as little as a few dollars a year.  Once you purchase a domain name, you need to set up the DNS settings correctly.  Most ISPs have an online control panel where you can do this yourself, but you may  have to contact them to assist you. Your domain needs to point to your VPS. To do  this, you create an "A" type DNS record that maps the domain to your IP.  Once your domain name points at your server, you can configure Apache to  recognize it by using it instead of our example.com placeholder that we put  in the Apache configuration files, such as  etc apache2 sites-available  waitercaller.conf.  Changes to domain names also take a while to propagate—that is, the major DNS  servers of the world need to be updated so that when someone visits your domain  name, the DNS server can redirect them to your IP address. DNS propagation can  take hours.  Adding HTTPS You've probably noticed that banks, large corporations such as Google and  Microsoft, and an ever-growing number of other companies, have their websites  automatically redirect to an HTTPS version. The "S" stands for secure, so the full  acronym becomes Hyper Text Transport Protocol Secure. Whenever you see HTTPS  in your browser's navigation bar  normally with a green padlock next to it  it means  that all traffic flowing between you and the server is encrypted. This prevents so- called man in the middle attacks, where a malicious person between you and the server  can view or modify the content that you and the server exchange.  Until recently, this encryption was achieved by the site owner by purchasing an  expensive certificate from Certificate Authority  CA . CA's job is to act as a trusted  third party between you and the server, issuing a signed certificate to the owner of  a site. This certificate can be used to set up an encrypted channel between the client  and the server. Because of the prohibitive cost, HTTPS was only used where security  was absolutely necessary  for example, in online banking  and by companies such  as Google who could afford the high fees. With everyone beginning to realize that  the trust-based model of World Wide Web is inherently flawed, HTTPS is becoming  more and more popular even for small blogs and personal websites. Companies such  as Let's Encrypt  https:  letsencrypt.org  are now offering certificates for free  and these certificates can easily be installed and configured to work with popular  web servers, such as Apache.  [ 230 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  A Sneak Peek into the Future   For our final project, as we are handling sensitive data  specifically passwords ,  using HTTPS is a must for nontrivial usage of our application, and it's also desirable  for our other two projects  HTTPS is always better than HTTP . Although the process  of setting up certificates to work with your web server is far simpler now than it was  a couple of years ago, a full walk-through of how to set up Apache2 to play with a  CA certificate is beyond the scope of this book.  However, if you only take the time to learn about one of the technologies mentioned  in this chapter, then it should be this one. Here is a link to a very simple Digital  Ocean tutorial that shows you how to set up the certificate on Ubuntu 14.04 to work  with Apache2  the exact configuration we used in this book :  https:  www.digitalocean.com community tutorials how-to-secure- apache-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-14-04  E-mail confirmation for new registrations You probably noted in our third project that our registration process was a little bit  unusual. The normal way for new users to register on a site is as follows:  1.  User fills out registration form and submits it. 2.  Server saves the data in the database. 3.  Server generates a unique and secure token and stores the token associated   with the registration, which it marks as incomplete.  4.  Server e-mails the token to the user in the form of a URL and requests that   the user click on the URL to confirm the account.  5.  User clicks on URL with the unique token. 6.  Server finds an incomplete registration associated with this token and marks   the registration as confirmed.  The preceding process is in order to prove that the user gave us a real e-mail address  to which he or she has access. Of course, the user does not want to wait for someone  to manually send an e-mail, so the confirmation e-mail has to be sent automatically.  This leads to a few complications, including the need to set up a mail server and the  fact that the automatic confirmation e-mail we send may well end up in the user's  spam folder, leading to frustration all round. Another option is to use an E-mail as a  service platform, such as Amazon's Simple E-mail Service  SES . However, these are  not usually free.  [ 231 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Appendix   Once the user has a confirmed e-mail account, we can also use it to allow the user to  reset a forgotten password. Again, this would involve sending an automatic e-mail to  users who wanted to reset their password. The e-mail would again contain a secure  unique token in a URL that the user would click on to prove that he or she really did  make the password reset request. We would then allow the user to type in a new  password and update the database with the new  hashed and salted  password. Note  that we can't and shouldn't send the user his or her own password because we store  only the salted and hashed version of the password; we have no way of discovering  the forgotten one.  The complete user account system with automatic e-mail confirmations and the  "forgot your password" functionality is fairly complex. We could set it up using  nothing but Python and Flask and an e-mail server, but in the next section, we'll   also discuss some more Flask extensions that could make this process easier.  Google Analytics If we run any of the web applications commercially, we'll probably be interested   in how many people actually use them. This would help us in deciding how    and whether  to monetize our applications and provide other useful insights.  The most common way to achieve this is through Google Analytics. This is a service  from Google to track not only how many people visit your site but also how long  they spend on it, how they found it, their country, information about the device they  use for web browsing, and many other insightful statistics. Google Analytics is free,  and to get started with using it, you need to simply create an account on https:   analytics.google.com  or use your existing Google account . After filling in  some information about your site, you'll be given a short snippet of JavaScript. This  JavaScript code contains a unique tracking ID assigned to your site. You need to add  the JavaScript code to your site, and whenever anyone visits the site, the JavaScript  code will be loaded into their web browser and will send information about them to  Google, which will then use the unique ID to associate the information with you. On  the Google Analytics dashboard, you can then see graphs of the number of visitors,  the length of their visits, and many more pieces of information.  In the case of our waiter-caller project, we'd add the JavaScript at the end of the  base.html file along with the Bootstrap JavaScript code.  [ 232 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  A Sneak Peek into the Future   Scalability The best problem to have as a web application creator is having made an application  that is too popular. If lots of people are visiting your application, it means that you  created something good  and you can possible start charging people money for it .  Our little VPS will not handle a lot of traffic. If thousands of people visit the site  simultaneously, we'll run out of network bandwidth, processing capacity, memory,  and disk space very quickly.  A complete discussion on creating scalable web applications would be a book all on  its own. However, some of the steps we would need to take would be:     Run the database on a dedicated machine: At the moment, we run our  web server and database on the same physical machine. For a larger web  application, the database would have its own dedicated machine so that  heavy database use  for instance, many restaurant patrons creating new  requests  wouldn't have a negative impact on the people who just wanted to  browse our home page. Normally, the database machine would have lots of  disk space and memory, while the machine running the web server would  focus more on having high bandwidth availability and processing power.    Run a load balancer: If we have a lot of visitors, one machine will not be    able to keep up with the load no matter how big and powerful the machine   is. We would therefore run several duplicate web server machines. The  problem would then be to evenly distribute new visitors among all the  different machines. To solve this, we would use something called a load  balancer, which is responsible for nothing but accepting the initial request   from the user  that is, when the user visits your homepage  and assigning  this user to one of the replica web servers.  As we grow bigger, the situation would grow more and more complicated, and  we would add replica database machines as well. A popular site requires full-time  maintenance, often by a team of people, because hardware fails, malicious users  exist, and updates  which are necessary to mitigate attacks by malicious users   tend to break the compatibility between software. On the bright side, if any web  applications were to grow popular enough to warrant the preceding, the application  would probably also generate enough revenue to make all the issues discussed an  "SEP", or somebody else's problem. That is, we could hire a system's administrator,   a database administrator, and a chief security officer, tell them to sort it out, and  spend the rest of our days on ocean cruises. On this note, let's take a look at some  Flask-specific expansions to our knowledge.  [ 233 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Appendix   Expanding your Flask knowledge You might expect that Flask, being a micro framework, could be covered in its entirety  in a single book. However, there are some potentially very useful parts of Flask that we  didn't need for any of our three projects. We'll briefly outline these here.  VirtualEnv The first library worth mentioning is not actually Flask-specific, and if you've spent  some time on Python development before, you will almost certainly come across it.  VirtualEnv is a Python library that creates a virtual Python environment on your  machine. It can be used in conjunction with Flask either only on your development  machine or both on your development machine and server. Its main purpose is to  isolate your entire Python environment into a virtual one, including all the Python  modules that you use. This has two major benefits. The first is that sometimes you  need to run two different Python projects on the same machine, but each project  requires a different version of the same library. Using VirtualEnv, each project  would have its own virtualized version of the Python setup, so it becomes trivial  to install two different version of the same library. The second advantage is that  your environment becomes more portable, and in theory, it is easy to migrate an  application running in a VirtualEnv environment to another machine that has  VirtualEnv installed.  The VirtualEnv environment is widely used for Python development, especially  for Flask. My decision to not include it in the main body of the book proved highly  controversial with the reviewers, many of whom felt that the book was incomplete  without it. I decided not to include it for two reasons. The first is that while I was  learning Flask, I read many tutorials and examples, which included VirtualEnv. I  always found the extra work needed for the setup and explanation of VirtualEnv  and virtual environments in general to be distracting from the main content of the  tutorial  namely, using Flask . The second reason is that I still often do not use it in  the Flask projects I build today. If you're not running old software that depends on  a particular version of a particular library, then installing useful Python libraries  system-wide so that they can be used by all your Python applications is convenient.  Also, sometimes, VirtualEnv can just become a mission without providing any value.  Of course, you may already have your own opinion on VirtualEnv, in which case  you're welcome to go along with it. There's nothing stopping anyone from building  any of the projects in this book in a VirtualEnv environment if they have a little  experience. If you have not used it before, it's well worth looking at. You can install it  through pip and try it out to take a look at exactly what it does and whether it can be  of use in your particular scenario. You can read more about it and how to use it here:  http:  docs.python-guide.org en latest dev virtualenvs   [ 234 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  A Sneak Peek into the Future   Flask Blueprints Perhaps the biggest feature of Flask that we haven't mentioned in this book is   Flask Blueprints. You must have noted after building three Flask applications that  certain patterns crop up time and again. Repeated code is bad code even over a  number of different applications; if you find a better way to do something or need   to make some changes for an update, you don't want to make the same change across  several applications.  Blueprints provide a way to specify patterns for a Flask application. If you have  several applications that use the same code to return templates or connect to a  database, you can rather write this common code in a blueprint and then have all the  applications register the blueprint.  You can read more about Flask Blueprints, take a look at examples, and learn how to  get started with using them at http:  flask.pocoo.org docs 0.10 blueprints .  Flask extensions We looked at quite a few different Flask extensions over the course of our three  projects. However, because of the educational focus of the book, we chose to write  some code from scratch that may be better off using existing extensions.  Generally  when developing, we want to avoid reinventing the wheel. If someone else has  already put thought into solving a problem and provided a well-developed and   well-maintained solution, it's better to use their offerings than to try and create our  own.  Of special interest are the extensions we could use to make our user account  system simpler and more powerful and those that offer us a more abstract way to  talk to our database.  Flask-SQLAlchemy Another controversial decision in this book was of not introducing the Flask- SQLAlchemy extension along with MySQL. SQLAlchemy provides a SQL toolkit  and ORM to make it easier and more secure to interact with SQL databases from a  Python environment. ORM provides another layer of abstraction between the web  application and database. Instead of having to write the SQL code directly, one  can make calls to a database using Python objects, which ORM will then translate  to and from SQL. This makes the database easier to write and maintain and also  more secure  ORM is normally very good at mitigating against any potential SQL  injection vulnerabilities . The reasons to omit it were similar to the reasons to omit  VirtualEnv—when learning, too many layers of abstraction can do more harm than  good, and it's always advantageous to have first-hand experience with the problems  that tools solve before blindly using the tools directly.  [ 235 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Appendix   For any Flask application that uses a MySQL database, such as our Crime Map   project, it is highly recommendable to use ORM, as with most Flask extensions.   Flask-SQLAlchemy is just a wrapper for an existing non-Flask-specific library.   You can find out more about SQLAlchemy at http:  www.sqlalchemy.org  and a  comprehensive guide to Flask-SQLAlchemy, including common usage patterns, here:  http:  flask.pocoo.org docs 0.10 patterns sqlalchemy   Flask MongoDB extensions There are several Flask extensions that are intended to make interfacing with  MongoDB easier. As MongoDB is relatively new, none of these has reached quite   the maturity or is in as wide use as SQLAlchemy; therefore, if you intend to use one   of them, it is recommended that you examine each to decide which one best suits   your needs. Flask-MongoAlchemy Perhaps the most similar to SQLAlchemy  and not just by name  is Flask- MongoAlchemy. Similarly to SQLAlchemy, MongoAlchemy is not Flask-specific.  You can read more about the main project here at http:  www.mongoalchemy.org.  Flask-MongoAlchemy is a Flask wrapper for MongoAlchemy, which you can read  more about here:  http:  pythonhosted.org Flask-MongoAlchemy  Flask-PyMongo A thinner wrapper to MongoDB that is closer to using PyMongo directly as we did  in our third project is Flask-PyMongo. Unlike MongoAlchemy, this does not provide  an ORM equivalent; instead, it simply provides a way of connecting to MongoDB  through PyMongo using syntax that is more consistent with the way Flask usually  handles external resources. You can have a quick introduction to Flask-PyMongo on  its GitHub page here:  https:  github.com dcrosta flask-pymongo  Flask-MongoEngine Yet another solution to using Flask in conjunction with MongoDB is MongoEngine   http:  mongoengine.org . This is notable because it integrates with WTForms  and Flask-Security, which we'll discuss in the following sections. You can read more  about the Flask-specific extension for Mongo Engine at https:  pypi.python.org  pypi flask-mongoengine.  [ 236 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  A Sneak Peek into the Future   Flask-Mail If we wanted to implement an automatic e-mail sending solution, such as that  described earlier in this chapter, a helpful extension would be Flask-Mail. This  allows you to easily send e-mails from your Flask application along with handling  attachments and bulk mailing. As mentioned before, these days, it's worthwhile to  consider using a third-party service such as Amazon's SES instead of sending e-mails  yourself. You can read more about Flask-Mail at http:  pythonhosted.org  Flask-Mail.  Flask-Security The final extension we'll talk about is Flask-Security. This extension is notable because  a large part of it is actually built by combining other Flask extensions. In some ways,  it departs from the Flask philosophy of doing as little as possible to be useful and  allowing the user full freedom for custom implementations. It assumes that you are  using one of the database frameworks we described, and it pulls together functionality  from Flask-Login, WTForms, Flask-Mail, and other extensions to attempt to make  building user account control systems as straightforward as possible. If we used this,  we would have had a centralized way of handling registering accounts, logging in  accounts, encrypting passwords, and sending e-mails instead of having to implement  each part of the login system separately. You can read more about Flask-Security here:  https:  pythonhosted.org Flask-Security  Other Flask extensions There are many Flask extensions, and we've only highlighted the ones that we think  would be generally applicable in many web development scenarios here. Of course,  when you develop a unique web application, you'll have much more specific needs,  and chances are that someone has already had a similar need and created a solution.  You can find an extensive  but not complete  list of Flask extensions here:  http:  flask.pocoo.org extensions  Expanding your web development  knowledge In this book, we focused on backend development—that done through Python or  Flask. A large part of developing web applications is building a frontend that is  powerful, aesthetically pleasing, and intuitive to use. Although we provided a solid  grounding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, each of these topics is big enough for its  own book, and many such books exist.  [ 237 ]  www.it-ebooks.info  Appendix   JavaScript is perhaps the most important of the three. Known as the "language of the  web", it has gained steadily in popularity over the last few years  although, as with  all languages, it has its fair share of critics . There are many frameworks for building  JavaScript-intensive web applications  so many, in fact, that their sheer number  and the frequency of new ones being released has become a topic of humor among  developers . We introduced Bootstrap in this book, which includes basic JavaScript  components, but for more heavily interactive applications, there exist larger  frameworks. Three of the more popular frontend frameworks include AngularJS   built by Google , React.js  built by Facebook , and Ember.js  sponsored by a variety  of corporations, including Yahoo! . Learning any of these frameworks or one of  the many others will definitely help you build larger and more complicated web  applications with richer frontends.  JavaScript is also no longer limited to the frontend, and many modern web  applications are built using JavaScript on the server side as well. A common way to  achieve this is through Node.js, which could have fully replaced Python and Flask in  any of the projects we built.  HTML5 and CSS3 have grown far more powerful than the older technologies they  evolved from. Earlier, there was a clear division of labor, with HTML for content, CSS  for styling, and JavaScript for actions. Now, there is far more overlap between the  capabilities of the three technologies, and some impressive and interactive applications  are built using only HTML5 and CSS3 without the normal addition of JavaScript.  Summary In this appendix, we looked forwards and pointed out some key areas and resources  that will help you move beyond what was covered in detail in this book. We covered  these areas in three topics: the projects we worked on in this book, the Flask resources  that we didn't use, and web development in general.  This brings us to the end. However, the world of technology is so vast and so rapidly  moving that, hopefully, this is more of a beginning than an end. As you continue  your adventures, learning more about life, Python, and web development, I hope  that some of the ideas presented in this book stay with you.
