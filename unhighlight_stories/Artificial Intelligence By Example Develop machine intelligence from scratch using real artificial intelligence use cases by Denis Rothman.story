[ 3 ]   Preface  To get the most out of this book Artificial intelligence projects rely on three factors:  Subject Matter Experts  SMEs . This implies having a practical view of how solutions can be used, not just developed. Find real-life examples around you to extend the case studies presented in the book. Applied mathematics and algorithms. Do not skip the mathematical equations if you have the energy to study them. AI relies heavily on mathematics. There are plenty of excellent websites that explain the mathematics used in the book. Development and production.  An artificial intelligence solution can be directly used on a cloud platform machine learning site  Google, Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, and others  online or with APIs. In the book, Amazon, IBM, and Google are described. Try to create an account of your own to explore cloud platforms.  Development still remains critical for artificial intelligence projects. Even with a cloud platform, scripts and services are necessary. Also, sometimes, writing an algorithm is mandatory because the ready-to-use online algorithms are insufficient for a given problem.

[ 7 ]   11  Become an Adaptive Thinker  In May 2017, Google revealed AutoML, an automated machine learning system that could create an artificial intelligence solution without the assistance of a human engineer. IBM Cloud and Amazon Web Services  AWS  offer machine learning solutions that do not require AI developers. GitHub and other cloud platforms already provide thousands of machine learning programs, reducing the need of having an AI expert at hand. These cloud platforms will slowly but surely reduce the need for artificial intelligence developers. Google Cloud's AI provides intuitive machine learning services. Microsoft Azure offers user-friendly machine learning interfaces.  At the same time, Massive Open Online Courses  MOOC  are flourishing everywhere. Anybody anywhere can pick up a machine learning solution on GitHub, follow a MOOC without even going to college, and beat any engineer to the job.  Today, artificial intelligence is mostly mathematics translated into source code which makes it difficult to learn for traditional developers. That is the main reason why Google, IBM, Amazon, Microsoft, and others have ready-made cloud solutions that will require fewer engineers in the future.  As you will see, starting with this chapter, you can occupy a central role in this new world as an adaptive thinker. There is no time to waste. In this chapter, we are going to dive quickly and directly into reinforcement learning, one of the pillars of Google Alphabet's DeepMind asset  the other being neural networks . Reinforcement learning often uses the Markov Decision Process  MDP . MDP contains a memoryless and unlabeled action- reward equation with a learning parameter. This equation, the Bellman equation  often coined as the Q function , was used to beat world-class Atari gamers.    Become an Adaptive Thinker  Chapter 1  The goal here is not to simply take the easy route. We're striving to break complexity into understandable parts and confront them with reality. You are going to find out right from the start how to apply an adaptive thinker's process that will lead you from an idea to a solution in reinforcement learning, and right into the center of gravity of Google's DeepMind projects.  The following topics will be covered in this chapter:  A three-dimensional method to implement AI, ML, and DL Reinforcement learning MDP Unsupervised learning Stochastic learning Memoryless learning The Bellman equation Convergence A Python example of reinforcement learning with the Q action-value function Applying reinforcement learning to a delivery example  Technical requirements  Python 3.6x 64-bit from  cid:73  cid:85  cid:85  cid:81  cid:84  cid:28  cid:17  cid:17  cid:88  cid:88  cid:88  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  cid:85  cid:73  cid:80  cid:79  cid:16  cid:80  cid:83  cid:72  cid:17   NumPy for Python 3.6x Program on Github,  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:18  cid:19  cid:2  cid:46  cid:37  cid:49  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90   Check out the following video to see the code in action:   cid:73  cid:85  cid:85  cid:81  cid:84  cid:28  cid:17  cid:17  cid:72  cid:80  cid:80  cid:16  cid:72  cid:77  cid:17  cid:25  cid:20  cid:85  cid:52  cid:89  cid:50   How to be an adaptive thinker Reinforcement learning, one of the foundations of machine learning, supposes learning through trial and error by interacting with an environment. This sounds familiar, right? That is what we humans do all our lives cid:100 in pain! Try things, evaluate, and then continue; or try something else.  [ 9 ]   Become an Adaptive Thinker  Chapter 1  In real life, you are the agent of your thought process. In a machine learning model, the agent is the function calculating through this trial-and-error process. This thought process in machine learning is the MDP. This form of action-value learning is sometimes called Q.  To master the outcomes of MDP  in theory and practice, a three-dimensional method is a prerequisite.  The three-dimensional approach that will make you an artificial expert, in general terms, means:  Starting by describing a problem to solve with real-life cases Then, building a mathematical model Then, write source code and or using a cloud platform solution  It is a way for you to enter any project with an adaptive attitude from the outset.  Addressing real-life issues before coding a solution In this chapter, we are going to tackle Markov's Decision Process  Q function  and apply it to reinforcement learning with the Bellman equation. You can find tons of source code and examples on the web. However, most of them are toy experiments that have nothing to do with real life. For example, reinforcement learning can be applied to an e-commerce business delivery person, self-driving vehicle, or a drone. You will find a program that calculates a drone delivery. However, it has many limits that need to be overcome. You as an adaptive thinker are going to ask some questions:  What if there are 5,000 drones over a major city at the same time? Is a drone-jam legal? What about the noise over the city? What about tourism? What about the weather? Weather forecasts are difficult to make, so how is this scheduled?  In just a few minutes, you will be at the center of attention, among theoreticians who know more than you on one side and angry managers who want solutions they cannot get on the other side. Your real-life approach will solve these problems.  [ 10 ]   Become an Adaptive Thinker  Chapter 1  A foolproof method is the practical three-dimensional approach:  Be a subject matter expert  SME : First, you have to be an SME. If a theoretician geek comes up with a hundred Google DeepMind TensorFlow functions to solve a drone trajectory problem, you now know it is going to be a tough ride if real- life parameters are taken into account. An SME knows the subject and thus can quickly identify the critical factors of a given field. Artificial intelligence often requires finding a solution to a hard problem that even an expert in a given field cannot express mathematically. Machine learning sometimes means finding a solution to a problem that humans do not know how to explain. Deep learning, involving complex networks, solves even more difficult problems. Have enough mathematical knowledge to understand AI concepts: Once you have the proper natural language analysis,  you need to build your abstract representation quickly. The best way is to look around at your everyday life and make a mathematical model of it. Mathematics is not an option in AI, but a prerequisite. The effort is worthwhile. Then, you can start writing solid source code or start implementing a cloud platform ML solution. Know what source code is about as well as its potential and limits: MDP is an excellent way to go and start working in the three dimensions that will make you adaptive: describing what is around you in detail in words, translating that into mathematical representations, and then implementing the result in your source code.  Step 1  cid:97  MDP in natural language Step 1 of any artificial intelligence problem is to transpose it into something you know in your everyday life  work or personal . Something you are an SME in. If you have a driver's license, then you are an SME of driving. You are certified. If you do not have a driver's license or never drive, you can easily replace moving around in a car by moving around on foot.  Let's say you are an e-commerce business driver delivering a package in an area you do not know. You are the operator of a self-driving vehicle. You have a GPS system with a beautiful color map on it. The areas around you are represented by the letters A to F, as shown in the simplified map in the following diagram. You are presently at F. Your goal is to reach area C. You are happy, listening to the radio. Everything is going smoothly, and it looks like you are going to be there on time. The following graph represents the locations and routes that you can possibly cover.  [ 11 ]   Become an Adaptive Thinker  Chapter 1  The guiding system's state indicates the complete path to reach C. It is telling you that you are going to go from F to B to D and then to C. It looks good!  To break things down further, let's say:  The present state is the letter s. Your next action is the letter a  action . This action a is not location A. The next action a  not location A  is to go to location B. You look at your guiding system; it tells you there is no traffic, and that to go from your present state F to your next state B will take you only a few minutes. Let's say that the next state B is the letter B.  At this point, you are still quite happy, and we can sum up your situation with the following sequence of events:  The letter s is your present state, your present situation. The letter a is the action you're deciding, which is to go to the next area; there you will be in another state, s'. We can say that thanks to the action a, you will go from s to s'.  Now, imagine that the driver is not you anymore. You are tired for some reason. That is when a self-driving vehicle comes in handy. You set your car to autopilot. Now you are not driving anymore; the system is. Let's call that system the agent. At point F, you set your car to autopilot and let the self-driving agent take over.  The agent now sees what you have asked it to do and checks its mapping environment, which represents all the areas in the previous diagram from A to F.  [ 12 ]   Become an Adaptive Thinker  Chapter 1  In the meantime, you are rightly worried. Is the agent going to make it or not? You are wondering if its strategy meets yours. You have your policy P cid:100 your way of thinking cid:100 which is to take the shortest paths possible. Will the agent agree? What's going on in its mind? You observe and begin to realize things you never noticed before. Since this is the first time you are using this car and guiding system, the agent is memoryless, which is an MDP feature. This means the agent just doesn't know anything about what went on before. It seems to be happy with just calculating from this state s at area F. It will use machine power to run as many calculations as necessary to reach its goal.  Another thing you are watching is the total distance from F to C to check whether things are OK. That means that the agent is calculating all the states from F to C.  In this case, state F is state 1, which we can simplify by writing s1. B is state 2, which we can simplify by write s2. D is s3 and C is  s4. The agent is calculating all of these possible states to make a decision.  The agent knows that when it reaches D, C will be better because the reward will be higher to go to C than anywhere else. Since it cannot eat a piece of cake to reward itself, the agent uses numbers. Our agent is a real number cruncher. When it is wrong, it gets a poor reward or nothing in this model. When it's right, it gets a reward represented by the letter R. This action-value  reward  transition, often named the Q function, is the core of many reinforcement learning algorithms.  When our agent goes from one state to another, it performs a transition and gets a reward. For example, the transition can be from F to B, state 1 to state 2, or s1 to s2.  You are feeling great and are going to be on time. You are beginning to understand how the machine learning agent in your self-driving car is thinking. Suddenly your guiding system breaks down. All you can see on the screen is that static image of the areas of the last calculation. You look up and see that a traffic jam is building up. Area D is still far away, and now you do not know whether it would be good to go from D to C or D to E to get a taxi that can take special lanes. You are going to need your agent!  The agent takes the traffic jam into account, is stubborn, and increases its reward to get to C by the shortest way. Its policy is to stick to the initial plan. You do not agree. You have another policy.  [ 13 ]   Become an Adaptive Thinker  Chapter 1  You stop the car. You both have to agree before continuing. You have your opinion and policy; the agent does not agree. Before continuing, your views need to converge. Convergence is the key to making sure that your calculations are correct. This is the kind of problem that persons, or soon, self-driving vehicles  not to speak about drone air jams , delivering parcels encounter all day long to get the workload done. The number of parcels to delivery per hour is an example of the workload that needs to be taken into account when making a decision.  To represent the problem at this point, the best way is to express this whole process mathematically.  Step 2  cid:97  the mathematical representation of the Bellman equation and MDP Mathematics involves a whole change in your perspective of a problem. You are going from words to functions, the pillars of source coding.  Expressing problems in mathematical notation does not mean getting lost in academic math to the point of never writing a single line of code. Mathematics is viewed in the perspective of getting a job done. Skipping mathematical representation will fast-track a few functions in the early stages of an AI project. However, when the real problems that occur in all AI projects surface, solving them with source code only will prove virtually impossible. The goal here is to pick up enough mathematics to implement a solution in real-life companies.  It is necessary to think of a problem through by finding something familiar around us, such as the delivery itinerary example covered before. It is a good thing to write it down with some abstract letters and symbols as described before, with a meaning an action and s meaning a state. Once you have understood the problem and expressed the parameters in a way you are used to, you can proceed further.  Now, mathematics well help clarify the situation by shorter descriptions. With the main ideas in mind, it is time to convert them into equations.   cid:39  cid:83  cid:80  cid:78  cid:2  cid:46  cid:37  cid:49  cid:2  cid:85  cid:80  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:35  cid:70  cid:77  cid:77  cid:78  cid:66  cid:79  cid:2  cid:70  cid:82  cid:86  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  In the previous step 1, the agent went from F or state 1 or s to B, which was state 2 or s'.  [ 14 ]   Become an Adaptive Thinker  Chapter 1  To do that, there was a strategy cid:100 a policy represented by P. All of this can be shown in one mathematical expression, the MDP state transition function:  P is the policy, the strategy made by the agent to go from F to B through action a. When going from F to B, this state transition is called state transition function:  a is the action s is state 1  F  and s' is state 2  B   This is the basis of MDP. The reward  right or wrong  is represented in the same way:  That means R is the reward for the action of going from state s to state s'. Going from one state to another will be a random process. This means that potentially, all states can go to another state.   The example we will be working on inputs a reward matrix so that the program can choose its best course of action. Then, the agent will go from state to state, learning the best trajectories for every possible starting location point. The goal of the MDP is to go to C  line 3, column 3 in the reward matrix , which has a starting value of 100 in the following Python code.   cid:5  cid:2  cid:46  cid:66  cid:83  cid:76  cid:80  cid:87  cid:2  cid:37  cid:70  cid:68  cid:74  cid:84  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:49  cid:83  cid:80  cid:68  cid:70  cid:84  cid:84  cid:2  cid:10  cid:46  cid:37  cid:49  cid:11  cid:2  cid:15  cid:2  cid:53  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:35  cid:70  cid:77  cid:77  cid:78  cid:66  cid:79  cid:2  cid:70  cid:82  cid:86  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:84  cid:2  cid:66  cid:69  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:69  cid:2  cid:85  cid:80   cid:5  cid:2  cid:51  cid:70  cid:74  cid:79  cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:68  cid:70  cid:78  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:2  cid:45  cid:70  cid:66  cid:83  cid:79  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72   cid:5  cid:2  cid:51  cid:2  cid:74  cid:84  cid:2  cid:53  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:51  cid:70  cid:88  cid:66  cid:83  cid:69  cid:2  cid:46  cid:66  cid:85  cid:83  cid:74  cid:89  cid:2  cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:70  cid:66  cid:68  cid:73  cid:2  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70   cid:51  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:82  cid:77  cid:16  cid:78  cid:66  cid:85  cid:83  cid:74  cid:89  cid:10  cid:60  cid:2  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:62  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14 100 cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:60  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:2  cid:62  cid:11   Each line in the matrix in the example represents a letter from A to F, and each column represents a letter from A to F. All possible states are represented. The  cid:19  values represent the nodes  vertices  of the graph. Those are the possible locations. For example, line 1 represents the possible moves for letter A, line 2 for letter B, and line 6 for letter F. On the first line, A cannot go to C directly, so a  cid:18  value is entered. But, it can go to E, so a  cid:19  value is added.  [ 15 ]   Become an Adaptive Thinker  Chapter 1  Some models start with -1 for impossible choices, such as B going directly to C and  cid:18  values to define the locations. This model starts with 0 and 1 values. It sometimes takes weeks to design functions that will create a reward matrix  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:20 , Think like a Machine .  There are several properties of this decision process. A few of them are mentioned here:  The Markov property: The process is applied when the past is not taken into account. It is the memoryless property of this decision process, just as you do in a car with a guiding system. You move forward to reach your goal. This is called the Markov property. Unsupervised learning: From this memoryless Markov property, it is safe to say that the MDP is not supervised learning. Supervised learning would mean that we would have all the labels of the trip. We would know exactly what A means and use that property to make a decision. We would be in the future looking at the past. MDP does not take these labels into account. This means that this is unsupervised learning. A decision has to be made in each state without knowing the past states or what they signify. It means that the car, for example, was on its own at each location, which is represented by each of its states. Stochastic process: In step 1, when state B was reached, the agent controlling the mapping system and the driver didn't agree on where to go. A random choice could be made in a trial-and-error way, just like a coin toss. It is going to be a heads-or-tails process. The agent will toss the coin thousands of times and measure the outcomes. That's precisely how MDP works and how the agent will learn. Reinforcement learning: Repeating a trial and error process with feedback from the agent's environment. Markov chain: The process of going from state to state with no history in a random, stochastic way is called a Markov chain.  To sum it up, we have three tools:  Pa s,s' : A policy, P, or strategy to move from one state to another Ta s,s' : A T, or stochastic  random  transition, function to carry out that action  Ra s,s' : An R, or reward, for that action, which can be negative, null, or positive  T is the transition function, which makes the agent decide to go from one point to another with a policy. In this case, it will be random. That's what machine power is for, and that's how reinforcement learning is often implemented.  [ 16 ]   Become an Adaptive Thinker  Chapter 1  Randomness is a property of MDP.  The following code describes the choice the agent is going to make.    cid:79  cid:70  cid:89  cid:85  cid:64  cid:66  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:82  cid:77  cid:16  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:80  cid:78  cid:16  cid:68  cid:73  cid:80  cid:74  cid:68  cid:70  cid:10  cid:49  cid:80  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:67  cid:77  cid:70  cid:34  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:14  cid:19  cid:11  cid:11   cid:83  cid:70  cid:85  cid:86  cid:83  cid:79  cid:2  cid:79  cid:70  cid:89  cid:85  cid:64  cid:66  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79   Once the code has been run, a new random action  state  has been chosen.  The Bellman equation is the road to programming reinforcement learning.  Bellman's equation completes the MDP. To calculate the value of a state, let's use  cid:50 , for the Q action-reward  or value  function. The pre-source code of Bellman's equation can be expressed as follows for one individual state:  The source code then translates the equation into a machine representation as in the following code:   cid:5  cid:2  cid:53  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:35  cid:70  cid:77  cid:77  cid:78  cid:66  cid:79  cid:2  cid:70  cid:82  cid:86  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:50  cid:60  cid:68  cid:86  cid:83  cid:83  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:64  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70  cid:14  cid:2  cid:66  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:62  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:51  cid:60  cid:68  cid:86  cid:83  cid:83  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:64  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70  cid:14  cid:2  cid:66  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:62  cid:2  cid:13  cid:2  cid:72  cid:66  cid:78  cid:78  cid:66  cid:2  cid:12  cid:2  cid:46  cid:66  cid:89  cid:55  cid:66  cid:77  cid:86  cid:70   The source code variables of the Bellman equation are as follows:   cid:50  cid:10  cid:84  cid:11 : This is the value calculated for this state cid:100 the total reward. In step 1 when the agent went from F to B, the driver had to be happy. Maybe she he had a crunch in a candy bar to feel good, which is the human counterpart of the reward matrix. The automatic driver maybe ate  reward matrix  some electricity, renewable energy of course! The reward is a number such as 50 or 100 to show the agent that it's on the right track. It's like when a student gets a good grade in an exam.  cid:51  cid:10  cid:84  cid:11 : This is the sum of the values up to there. It's the total reward at that point.  [ 17 ]   Become an Adaptive Thinker  Chapter 1   cid:101  = gamma: This is here to remind us that trial and error has a price. We're wasting time, money, and energy. Furthermore, we don't even know whether the next step is right or wrong since we're in a trial-and-error mode. Gamma is often set to  cid:18  cid:16  cid:26 . What does that mean? Suppose you're taking an exam. You study and study, but you don't really know the outcome. You might have 80 out of 100  0.8  chances of clearing it. That's painful, but that's life. This is what makes Bellman's equation and MDP realistic and efficient.  cid:78  cid:66  cid:89  cid:10  cid:84  cid:9  cid:11 : s cid:9  is one of the possible states that can be reached with Pa  s,s' ;  cid:78  cid:66  cid:89  is the highest value on the line of that state  location line in the reward matrix .  Step 3  cid:97  implementing the solution in Python In step 1, a problem was described in natural language to be able to talk to experts and understand what was expected. In step 2, an essential mathematical bridge was built between natural language and source coding. Step 3 is the software implementation phase. When a problem comes up cid:100 and rest assured that one always does cid:100 it will be possible to go back over the mathematical bridge with the customer or company team, and even further back to the natural language process if necessary.  This method guarantees success for any project. The code in this chapter is in Python 3.6. It is a reinforcement learning program using the Q function with the following reward matrix:   cid:74  cid:78  cid:81  cid:80  cid:83  cid:85  cid:2  cid:79  cid:86  cid:78  cid:81  cid:90  cid:2  cid:66  cid:84  cid:2  cid:82  cid:77   cid:51  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:82  cid:77  cid:16  cid:78  cid:66  cid:85  cid:83  cid:74  cid:89  cid:10  cid:60  cid:2  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:62  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:18  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:60  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:2  cid:62  cid:11    cid:50  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:82  cid:77  cid:16  cid:78  cid:66  cid:85  cid:83  cid:74  cid:89  cid:10  cid:82  cid:77  cid:16  cid:91  cid:70  cid:83  cid:80  cid:84  cid:10  cid:60  cid:24  cid:14  cid:24  cid:62  cid:11  cid:11    cid:72  cid:66  cid:78  cid:78  cid:66  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:26    cid:51  is the reward matrix described in the mathematical analysis.   [ 18 ]   Become an Adaptive Thinker  Chapter 1   cid:50   inherits the same structure as  cid:51 , but all values are set to  cid:18  since this is a learning matrix. It will progressively contain the results of the decision process. The gamma variable is a double reminder that the system is learning and that its decisions have only an 80% chance of being correct each time. As the following code shows, the system explores the possible actions during the process.   cid:66  cid:72  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:64  cid:84  cid:64  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:19    cid:5  cid:2  cid:53  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:81  cid:80  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:67  cid:77  cid:70  cid:2  cid:4  cid:66  cid:4  cid:2  cid:66  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:84  cid:2  cid:88  cid:73  cid:70  cid:79  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:66  cid:72  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:2  cid:74  cid:84  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:66  cid:2  cid:72  cid:74  cid:87  cid:70  cid:79  cid:2  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70   cid:69  cid:70  cid:71  cid:2  cid:81  cid:80  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:67  cid:77  cid:70  cid:64  cid:66  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:84  cid:10  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70  cid:11  cid:28   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:68  cid:86  cid:83  cid:83  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:64  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70  cid:64  cid:83  cid:80  cid:88  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:51  cid:60  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70  cid:14  cid:62   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:81  cid:80  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:67  cid:77  cid:70  cid:64  cid:66  cid:68  cid:85  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:82  cid:77  cid:16  cid:88  cid:73  cid:70  cid:83  cid:70  cid:10 current_state_row >0 cid:11  cid:60  cid:19  cid:62   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:83  cid:70  cid:85  cid:86  cid:83  cid:79  cid:2  cid:81  cid:80  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:67  cid:77  cid:70  cid:64  cid:66  cid:68  cid:85    cid:5  cid:2  cid:40  cid:70  cid:85  cid:2  cid:66  cid:87  cid:66  cid:74  cid:77  cid:66  cid:67  cid:77  cid:70  cid:2  cid:66  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:84  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:68  cid:86  cid:83  cid:83  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:2  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70   cid:49  cid:80  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:67  cid:77  cid:70  cid:34  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:81  cid:80  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:67  cid:77  cid:70  cid:64  cid:66  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:84  cid:10  cid:66  cid:72  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:64  cid:84  cid:64  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70  cid:11   The agent starts in state 1, for example. You can start wherever you want because it's a random process. Note that only values > 0 are taken into account. They represent the possible moves  decisions .  The current state goes through an analysis process to find possible actions  next possible states . You will note that there is no algorithm in the traditional sense with many rules.

The lessons of reinforcement learning Unsupervised reinforcement machine learning, such as MDP and Bellman's equation, will topple traditional decision-making software in the next few years. Memoryless reinforcement learning requires few to no business rules and thus doesn't require human knowledge to run.  [ 20 ]   Become an Adaptive Thinker  Chapter 1  Being an adaptive AI thinker involves three requisites cid:100 the effort to be an SME, working on mathematical models, and understanding source code's potential and limits:  Lesson 1: Machine learning through reinforcement learning can beat human intelligence in many cases. No use fighting! The technology and solutions are already here. Lesson 2: Machine learning has no emotions, but you do. And so do the people around you. Human emotions and teamwork are an essential asset. Become an SME for your team. Learn how to understand what they're trying to say intuitively and make a mathematical representation of it for them. This job will never go away, even if you're setting up solutions such as Google's AutoML that don't require much development.  Reinforcement learning shows that no human can solve a problem the way a machine does; 50,000 iterations with random searching is not an option. The days of neuroscience imitating humans are over. Cheap, powerful computers have all the leisure it takes to compute millions of possibilities and choose the best trajectories.  Humans need to be more intuitive, make a few decisions, and see what happens because humans cannot try 50,000 ways of doing something. Reinforcement learning marks a new era for human thinking by surpassing human reasoning power.  On the other hand, reinforcement learning requires mathematical models to function. Humans excel in mathematical abstraction, providing powerful intellectual fuel to those powerful machines.  The boundaries between humans and machines have changed. Humans' ability to build mathematical models and every-growing cloud platforms will serve online machine learning services.  Finding out how to use the outputs of the reinforcement learning program we just studied shows how a human will always remain at the center of artificial intelligence.  How to use the outputs The reinforcement program we studied contains no trace of a specific field, as in traditional software.

reinforced learning process, and also a normed  cid:50   highest value divided by other values .  As Python geeks, we are overjoyed. We made something rather difficult to work, namely reinforcement learning. As mathematical amateurs, we are elated. We know what MDP and Bellman's equation mean.  However, as natural language thinkers, we have made little progress. No customer or user can read that data and make sense of it. Furthermore, we cannot explain how we implemented an intelligent version of his her job in the machine. We didn't.  We hardly dare say that reinforcement learning can beat anybody in the company making random choices 50,000 times until the right answer came up.  Furthermore, we got the program to work but hardly know what to do with the result ourselves. The consultant on the project cannot help because of the matrix format of the solution.  Being an adaptive thinker means knowing how to be good in all the dimensions of a subject. To solve this new problem, let's go back to step 1 with the result.  [ 22 ]   Become an Adaptive Thinker  Chapter 1  By formatting the result in Python, a graphics tool, or a spreadsheet, the result that is displayed as follows:    A A - B - C - D - E 207.752 - F -  C D - - - 321.8 - 500 321.8 -  B - - -  258.44 401. -  -  258.44 -  321.8 - - -  E F  258.44 -  207.752 -  258.44 - - -  Now, we can start reading the solution:  Choose a starting state. Take F for example. The F line represents the state. Since the maximum value is 258.44 in the B column, we go to state B, the second line. The maximum value in state B in the second line leads us to the D state in the fourth column. The highest maximum of the D state  fourth line  leads us to the C state.  Note that if you start at the C state and decide not to stay at C, the D state becomes the maximum value, which will lead you to back to C. However, the MDP will never do this naturally. You will have to force the system to do it.  You have now obtained a sequence: F->B->D->C. By choosing other points of departure, you can obtain other sequences by simply sorting the table.  The most useful way of putting it remains the normalized version in percentages. This reflects the stochastic  random  property of the solution, which produces probabilities and not certainties, as shown in the following matrix:    A A - B - C - D - E 41.55% - F -  D C - - - 64.36% - 100% 64.36% -  B - - - 51.68% 80.2% -  - 51.68% -  64.36% - - -  E F 51.68% -  41.55% - 51.68% - - -  [ 23 ]   Become an Adaptive Thinker  Chapter 1  Now comes the very tricky part. We started the chapter with a trip on a road. But I made no mention of it in the result analysis.   An important property of reinforcement learning comes from the fact that we are working with a mathematical model that can be applied to anything. No human rules are needed. This means we can use this program for many other subjects without writing thousands of lines of code.  Case 1: Optimizing a delivery for a driver, human or not  This model was described in this chapter.  Case 2: Optimizing warehouse flows  The same reward matrix can apply to going from point F to C in a warehouse, as shown in the following diagram:  In this warehouse, the F->B->D->C sequence makes visual sense. If somebody goes from point F to C, then this physical path makes sense without going through walls.  It can be used for a video game, a factory, or any form of layout.  Case 3: Automated planning and scheduling  APS   By converting the system into a scheduling vector, the whole scenery changes. We have left the more comfortable world of physical processing of letters, faces, and trips. Though fantastic, those applications are social media's tip of the iceberg. The real challenge of artificial intelligence begins in the abstract universe of human thinking.   [ 24 ]   Become an Adaptive Thinker  Chapter 1  Every single company, person, or system requires automatic planning and scheduling  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:20 , Automated Planning and Scheduling . The six A to F steps in the example of this chapter could well be six tasks to perform in a given unknown order represented by the following vector x:  The reward matrix then reflects the weights of constraints of the tasks of vector x to perform. For example, in a factory, you cannot assemble the parts of a product before manufacturing them.  In this case, the sequence obtained represents the schedule of the manufacturing process.  Case 4 and more: Your imagination  By using physical layouts or abstract decision-making vectors, matrices, and tensors, you can build a world of solutions in a mathematical reinforcement learning model. Naturally, the following chapters will enhance your toolbox with many other concepts.  Machine learning versus traditional applications Reinforcement learning based on stochastic  random  processes will evolve beyond traditional approaches. In the past, we would sit down and listen to future users to understand their way of thinking.  We would then go back to our keyboard and try to imitate the human way of thinking. Those days are over. We need proper datasets and ML DL equations to move forward. Applied mathematics has taken reinforcement learning to the next level. Traditional software will soon be in the museum of computer science.   An artificial adaptive thinker sees the world through applied mathematics translated into machine representations.  [ 25 ]   Become an Adaptive Thinker  Chapter 1  Use the Python source code example provided in this chapter in different ways. Run it; try to change some parameters to see what happens. Play around with the number of iterations as well. Lower the number from 50,000 down to where you find its best. Change the reward matrix a little to see what happens. Design your own reward matrix trajectory. It can be an itinerary or a decision-making process.  Summary Presently, artificial intelligence is predominantly a branch of applied mathematics, not of neurosciences. You must master the basics of linear algebra and probabilities. That's a difficult task for a developer used to intuitive creativity. With that knowledge, you will see that humans cannot rival with machines that have CPU and mathematical functions. You will also understand that machines, contrary to the hype around you, don't have emotions although we can represent them to a scary point  See  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:24 , Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots, and  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:25 , Quantum Computers That Think  in chatbots.

That part is the real fulfilling aspect of a project cid:100 imagining it first and then implementing it with a group of real-life people.  MDP, a stochastic random action-reward  value  system enhanced by Bellman's equation, will provide effective solutions to many AI problems. These mathematical tools fit perfectly in corporate environments.  Reinforcement learning using the Q action-value function is memoryless  no past  and unsupervised  the data is not labeled or classified .

The agent was a driver. You are at the heart of DeepMind's approach to AI.  DeepMind is no doubt one of the world leaders in applied artificial intelligence. Scientific, mathematical, and applications research drives its strategy.  DeepMind was founded in 2010, was acquired by Google in 2014, and is now part of Alphabet, a collection of companies that includes Google.  One of the focuses of DeepMind is on reinforcement learning. They came up with an innovate version of reinforcement learning called DQN and referring to deep neural networks using the Q function  Bellman's equation . A seminal article published in February 2015 in Nature  see the link at the end of the chapter  shows how DQN outperformed other artificial intelligence research by becoming a human game tester itself. DQN then went on to beat human game testers.  In this chapter, the agent will be an automated guided vehicle  AGV . An AGV takes over the transport tasks in a warehouse. This case study opens promising perspectives for jobs and businesses using DQN. Thousands upon thousands of warehouses require complex reinforcement learning and customized transport optimization.  This chapter focuses on creating the reward matrix, which was the entry point of the Python example in the first chapter. To do so, it describes how to add a primitive McCulloch-Pitts neuron in TensorFlow to create an intelligent adaptive network and add an N  network  to a Q model. It's a small N that will become a feedforward neural network in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:22 , Become an Unconventional Innovator, and more in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:20 , Automated Planning and Scheduling. The goal is not to copy DQN but to use the conceptual power of the model to build a variety of solutions.   Think like a Machine  Chapter 2  The challenge in this chapter will be to think literally like a machine. The effort is not to imitate human thinking but to beat humans with machines. This chapter will take you very far from human reasoning into the depth of machine thinking.  The following topics will be covered in this chapter:  AGV The McCulloch-Pitts neuron Creating a reward matrix Logistic classifiers The logistic sigmoid The softmax function The one-hot function How to apply machine learning tools to real-life problems such as warehouse management  Technical requirements  Python 3.6x 64-bit from  cid:73  cid:85  cid:85  cid:81  cid:84  cid:28  cid:17  cid:17  cid:88  cid:88  cid:88  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  cid:85  cid:73  cid:80  cid:79  cid:16  cid:80  cid:83  cid:72  cid:17  NumPy for Python 3.6x TensorFlow from  cid:73  cid:85  cid:85  cid:81  cid:84  cid:28  cid:17  cid:17  cid:69  cid:70  cid:70  cid:81  cid:78  cid:74  cid:79  cid:69  cid:16  cid:68  cid:80  cid:78  cid:17  with TensorBoard  The following files:   cid:73  cid:85  cid:85  cid:81  cid:84  cid:28  cid:17  cid:17  cid:72  cid:74  cid:85  cid:73  cid:86  cid:67  cid:16  cid:68  cid:80  cid:78  cid:17  cid:49  cid:66  cid:68  cid:76  cid:85  cid:49  cid:86  cid:67  cid:77  cid:74  cid:84  cid:73  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:17  cid:34  cid:83  cid:85  cid:74  cid:71  cid:74  cid:68  cid:74  cid:66  cid:77  cid:15  cid:42  cid:79  cid:85  cid:70  cid:77  cid:77  cid:74  cid:72  cid:70  cid:79  cid:68  cid:70  cid:15  cid:35  cid:90  cid:15  cid:38  cid:89  cid:66  cid:78  cid:81  cid:77  cid:70  cid:17   cid:67  cid:77  cid:80  cid:67  cid:17  cid:78  cid:66  cid:84  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:17  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:18  cid:20  cid:17  cid:46  cid:36  cid:49  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90    cid:73  cid:85  cid:85  cid:81  cid:84  cid:28  cid:17  cid:17  cid:72  cid:74  cid:85  cid:73  cid:86  cid:67  cid:16  cid:68  cid:80  cid:78  cid:17  cid:49  cid:66  cid:68  cid:76  cid:85  cid:49  cid:86  cid:67  cid:77  cid:74  cid:84  cid:73  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:17  cid:34  cid:83  cid:85  cid:74  cid:71  cid:74  cid:68  cid:74  cid:66  cid:77  cid:15  cid:42  cid:79  cid:85  cid:70  cid:77  cid:77  cid:74  cid:72  cid:70  cid:79  cid:68  cid:70  cid:15  cid:35  cid:90  cid:15  cid:38  cid:89  cid:66  cid:78  cid:81  cid:77  cid:70  cid:17   cid:67  cid:77  cid:80  cid:67  cid:17  cid:78  cid:66  cid:84  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:17  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:18  cid:20  cid:17  cid:52  cid:48  cid:39  cid:53  cid:46  cid:34  cid:57  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90   Check out the following video to see the code in action:   cid:73  cid:85  cid:85  cid:81  cid:84  cid:28  cid:17  cid:17  cid:72  cid:80  cid:80  cid:16  cid:72  cid:77  cid:17  cid:75  cid:46  cid:56  cid:45  cid:72  cid:26   [ 29 ]   Think like a Machine  Chapter 2  Designing datasets  cid:97  where the dream stops and the hard work begins As in the previous chapter, bear in mind that a real-life project goes through a three- dimensional method in some form or the other. First, it's important to just think and talk about the problem to solve without jumping onto a laptop. Once that is done, bear in mind that the foundation of machine learning and deep learning relies on mathematics. Finally, once the problem has been discussed and mathematically represented, it is time to develop the solution.  First, think of a problem in natural language. Then, make a mathematical description of a problem. Only then, start the software implementation.  Designing datasets in natural language meetings The reinforcement learning program described in the first chapter can solve a variety of problems involving unlabeled classification in an unsupervised decision-making process. The Q function can be applied indifferently to drone, truck, or car deliveries. It can also be applied to decision-making in games or real life.  However, in a real-life case study problem  such as defining the reward matrix in a warehouse for the AGV, for example , the difficulty will be to design a matrix that everybody agrees with.  This means many meetings with the IT department to obtain data, the SME and reinforcement learning experts. An AGV requires information coming from different sources: daily forecasts and real-time warehouse flows.  At one point, the project will be at a standstill. It is simply too complicated to get the right data for the reinforcement program. This is a real-life case study that I modified a little for confidentiality reasons.  The warehouse manages thousands of locations and hundreds of thousands of inputs and outputs. The Q function does not satisfy the requirement in itself. A small neural network is required.  [ 30 ]   Think like a Machine  Chapter 2  In the end, through tough negotiations with both the IT department and the users, a dataset format is designed that fits the needs of the reinforcement learning program and has enough properties to satisfy the AGV.  Using the McCulloch-Pitts neuron  The mathematical aspect relies on finding a model for inputs for huge volumes in a corporate warehouse.  In one mode, the inputs can be described as follows:  Thousands of forecast product arrivals with a low priority weight: w1 = 10 Thousands of confirmed arrivals with a high priority weight: w2 = 70 Thousands of unplanned arrivals decided by the sales department: w3 = 75 Thousands of forecasts with a high priority weight: w4 = 60 Thousands of confirmed arrivals that have a low turnover and so have a low weight: w5 = 20  These weights represent vector w:     All of these products have to be stored in optimal locations, and the distance between nearly 100 docks and thousands of locations in the warehouse for the AGV has to be minimized.  Let's focus on our neuron. Only these weights will be used, though a system such as this one will add up to more than 50 weights and parameters per neuron.  In the first chapter, the reward matrix was size 6x6. Six locations were described  A to F , and now six locations  l1 to l6  will be represented in a warehouse.  A 6x6 reward matrix represents the target of the McCulloch-Pitts layer implemented for the six locations.  [ 31 ]   Think like a Machine  Chapter 2  Also, this matrix was the input in the first chapter. In real life, and in real companies, you will have to find a way to build datasets from scratch. The reward matrix becomes the output of this part of the process. The following source code shows the input of the reinforcement learning program used in the first chapter. The goal of this chapter describes how to produce the following reward matrix.   cid:5  cid:2  cid:51  cid:2  cid:74  cid:84  cid:2  cid:53  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:51  cid:70  cid:88  cid:66  cid:83  cid:69  cid:2  cid:46  cid:66  cid:85  cid:83  cid:74  cid:89  cid:2  cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:70  cid:66  cid:68  cid:73  cid:2  cid:77  cid:80  cid:68  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:66  cid:2  cid:88  cid:66  cid:83  cid:70  cid:73  cid:80  cid:86  cid:84  cid:70  cid:2  cid:10  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:66  cid:79  cid:90  cid:2  cid:80  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:83   cid:81  cid:83  cid:80  cid:67  cid:77  cid:70  cid:78  cid:11    cid:51  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:82  cid:77  cid:16  cid:78  cid:66  cid:85  cid:83  cid:74  cid:89  cid:10  cid:60  cid:2  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:62  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:18  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:60  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:2  cid:62  cid:11   For this warehouse problem, the McCulloch-Pitts neuron sums up the weights of the priority vector described previously to fill in the reward matrix.  Each location will require its neuron, with its weights.  Inputs are the flows in a warehouse or any form of data Weights will be defined in this model  Bias is for stabilizing the weights Values will be the output  There are as many ways as you can imagine to create reward matrices. This chapter describes one way of doing it that works.  The McCulloch-Pitts neuron The McCulloch-Pitts neuron dates back to 1943. It contains inputs, weights, and an activation function. This is precisely where you need to think like a machine and forget about human neuroscience brain approaches for this type of problem. Starting from  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:26 , Revolutions Designed for Some Corporations and Disruptive Innovations Small to Large Companies, human cognition will be built on top of these models, but the foundations need to remain mathematical.  [ 32 ]   Think like a Machine  Chapter 2  The following diagram shows the McCulloch-Pitts, neuron model.  This model contains a number of input x weights that are summed to either reach a threshold which will lead, once transformed, to y = 0, or 1 output. In this model, y will be calculated in a more complex way.  A Python-TensorFlow program,  cid:46  cid:36  cid:49  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  will be used to illustrate the neuron.  When designing neurons, the computing performance needs to be taken into account. The following source code configures the threads. You can fine-tune your model according to your needs.   cid:68  cid:80  cid:79  cid:71  cid:74  cid:72  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:36  cid:80  cid:79  cid:71  cid:74  cid:72  cid:49  cid:83  cid:80  cid:85  cid:80  cid:10   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:64  cid:80  cid:81  cid:64  cid:81  cid:66  cid:83  cid:66  cid:77  cid:77  cid:70  cid:77  cid:74  cid:84  cid:78  cid:64  cid:85  cid:73  cid:83  cid:70  cid:66  cid:69  cid:84  cid:31  cid:22  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:64  cid:80  cid:81  cid:64  cid:81  cid:66  cid:83  cid:66  cid:77  cid:77  cid:70  cid:77  cid:74  cid:84  cid:78  cid:64  cid:85  cid:73  cid:83  cid:70  cid:66  cid:69  cid:84  cid:31  cid:22   cid:11   In the following source code, the placeholders that will contain the input values   cid:89  , the weights   cid:88  , and the bias   cid:67   are initialized. A placeholder is not just a variable that you can declare and use later when necessary. It represents the structure of your graph:   cid:89  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:81  cid:77  cid:66  cid:68  cid:70  cid:73  cid:80  cid:77  cid:69  cid:70  cid:83  cid:10  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:71  cid:77  cid:80  cid:66  cid:85  cid:21  cid:20  cid:14  cid:2  cid:84  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:70  cid:31  cid:10  cid:19  cid:14  cid:2  cid:24  cid:11  cid:14  cid:2  cid:79  cid:66  cid:78  cid:70  cid:31  cid:9  cid:89  cid:9  cid:11   cid:88  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:81  cid:77  cid:66  cid:68  cid:70  cid:73  cid:80  cid:77  cid:69  cid:70  cid:83  cid:10  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:71  cid:77  cid:80  cid:66  cid:85  cid:21  cid:20  cid:14  cid:2  cid:84  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:70  cid:31  cid:10  cid:24  cid:14  cid:2  cid:19  cid:11  cid:14  cid:2  cid:79  cid:66  cid:78  cid:70  cid:31  cid:9  cid:88  cid:9  cid:11   cid:67  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:81  cid:77  cid:66  cid:68  cid:70  cid:73  cid:80  cid:77  cid:69  cid:70  cid:83  cid:10  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:71  cid:77  cid:80  cid:66  cid:85  cid:21  cid:20  cid:14  cid:2  cid:84  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:70  cid:31  cid:10  cid:19  cid:11  cid:14  cid:2  cid:79  cid:66  cid:78  cid:70  cid:31  cid:9  cid:67  cid:9  cid:11   In the original McCulloch-Pitts artificial neuron, the inputs   cid:89   were multiplied by the following weights:  [ 33 ]   Think like a Machine  Chapter 2  The mathematical function becomes a one-line code with a logistic activation function  sigmoid , which will be explained in the second part of the chapter. Bias   cid:67   has been added, which makes this neuron format useful even today shown as follows.   cid:90  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:78  cid:66  cid:85  cid:78  cid:86  cid:77  cid:10  cid:89  cid:14  cid:2  cid:88  cid:11  cid:2  cid:13  cid:2  cid:67   cid:84  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:79  cid:79  cid:16  cid:84  cid:74  cid:72  cid:78  cid:80  cid:74  cid:69  cid:10  cid:90  cid:11   Before starting a session, the McCulloch-Pitts neuron  1943  needs an operator to directly set its weights. That is the main difference between the McCulloch-Pitts neuron and the perceptron  1957 , which is the model of modern deep learning neurons. The perceptron optimizes its weights through optimizing processes.  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:22 , Become an Unconventional Innovator, describes the modern perceptron.  The weights are now provided, and so are the quantities for each x stored at l1, one of the locations of the warehouse:     The weight values will be divided by 100, to represent percentages in terms of 0 to 1 values of warehouse flows in a given location. The following code deals with the choice of one location, l1 only, its values, and parameters.   cid:88  cid:74  cid:85  cid:73  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:52  cid:70  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:10  cid:68  cid:80  cid:79  cid:71  cid:74  cid:72  cid:31  cid:68  cid:80  cid:79  cid:71  cid:74  cid:72  cid:11  cid:2  cid:66  cid:84  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:84  cid:28   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:84  cid:16  cid:83  cid:86  cid:79  cid:10  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:72  cid:77  cid:80  cid:67  cid:66  cid:77  cid:64  cid:87  cid:66  cid:83  cid:74  cid:66  cid:67  cid:77  cid:70  cid:84  cid:64  cid:74  cid:79  cid:74  cid:85  cid:74  cid:66  cid:77  cid:74  cid:91  cid:70  cid:83  cid:10  cid:11  cid:11   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:88  cid:64  cid:85  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:60  cid:60  cid:16  cid:19  cid:14  cid:2  cid:16  cid:25  cid:14  cid:2  cid:16  cid:25  cid:23  cid:14  cid:2  cid:16  cid:24  cid:18  cid:14  cid:2  cid:16  cid:20  cid:18  cid:62  cid:62   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:89  cid:64  cid:19  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:60  cid:60  cid:19  cid:18  cid:14  cid:2  cid:20  cid:14  cid:2  cid:19  cid:16  cid:14  cid:2  cid:24  cid:16  cid:14  cid:2  cid:20  cid:16  cid:62  cid:62   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:67  cid:64  cid:19  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:60  cid:19  cid:62   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:88  cid:64  cid:19  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:79  cid:81  cid:16  cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:84  cid:81  cid:80  cid:84  cid:70  cid:10  cid:88  cid:64  cid:85  cid:11   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:87  cid:66  cid:77  cid:86  cid:70  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:84  cid:16  cid:83  cid:86  cid:79  cid:10  cid:84  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:71  cid:70  cid:70  cid:69  cid:64  cid:69  cid:74  cid:68  cid:85  cid:31  cid:92   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:89  cid:28  cid:2  cid:89  cid:64  cid:19  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:88  cid:28  cid:2  cid:88  cid:64  cid:19  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:67  cid:28  cid:2  cid:67  cid:64  cid:19   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:94   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:11   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:2  cid:10  cid:9  cid:87  cid:66  cid:77  cid:86  cid:70  cid:2  cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:73  cid:80  cid:77  cid:69  cid:2  cid:68  cid:66  cid:77  cid:68  cid:86  cid:77  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:9  cid:14  cid:87  cid:66  cid:77  cid:86  cid:70  cid:11   [ 34 ]   Think like a Machine  Chapter 2  The session starts; the weights   cid:88  cid:64  cid:85   and the quantities   cid:89  cid:64  cid:19   of the warehouse flow are entered. Bias is set to  cid:19  in this model.  cid:88  cid:64  cid:19  is transposed to fit  cid:89  cid:64  cid:19 . The placeholders are solicited with  cid:71  cid:70  cid:70  cid:69  cid:64  cid:69  cid:74  cid:68  cid:85 , and the value of the neuron is calculated using the sigmoid function.  The program returns the following value.   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:2  cid:10  cid:9  cid:87  cid:66  cid:77  cid:86  cid:70  cid:2  cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:73  cid:80  cid:77  cid:69  cid:2  cid:68  cid:66  cid:77  cid:68  cid:86  cid:77  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:9  cid:14  cid:87  cid:66  cid:77  cid:86  cid:70  cid:11   cid:87  cid:66  cid:77  cid:86  cid:70  cid:2  cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:73  cid:80  cid:77  cid:69  cid:2  cid:68  cid:66  cid:77  cid:68  cid:86  cid:77  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:60  cid:60  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:27  cid:27  cid:27  cid:25  cid:19  cid:19  cid:21  cid:21  cid:62  cid:62   This value represents the activity of location l1 at a given date and a given time. The higher the value, the higher the probable saturation rate of this area. That means there is little space left for an AGV that would like to store products. That is why the reinforcement learning program for a warehouse is looking for the least loaded area for a given product in this model.  Each location has a probable availability:  A = Availability = 1 - load  The probability of a load of a given storage point lies between 0 and 1.  High values of availability will be close to 1, and low probabilities will be close to 0 as shown in the following example:   cid:32  cid:32  cid:32  cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:2  cid:10  cid:9  cid:34  cid:87  cid:66  cid:74  cid:77  cid:66  cid:67  cid:74  cid:77  cid:74  cid:85  cid:90  cid:2  cid:80  cid:71  cid:2  cid:77  cid:89  cid:9  cid:14  cid:19  cid:15  cid:87  cid:66  cid:77  cid:86  cid:70  cid:11   cid:34  cid:87  cid:66  cid:74  cid:77  cid:66  cid:67  cid:74  cid:77  cid:74  cid:85  cid:90  cid:2  cid:80  cid:71  cid:2  cid:77  cid:89  cid:2  cid:60  cid:60  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18  cid:20  cid:26  cid:26  cid:24  cid:25  cid:62  cid:62   For example, the load of l1 has a probable load of 0.99 and its probable availability is 0.002. The goal of the AGV is to search and find the closest and most available location to optimize its trajectories. l1 is obviously not a good candidate at that day and time. Load is a keyword in production activities as in the Amazon example in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:20 , Automated Planning and Scheduling.  When all of the six locations' availabilities has been calculated by the McCulloch-Pitts neuron cid:100 each with its respective x quantity inputs, weights, and bias cid:100 a location vector of the results of this system will be produced. This means that the program needs to be implemented to run all six locations and not just one location:  A L  = {a l1 ,a l2 ,a l3 ,a l4 ,a l5 ,a l6 }   [ 35 ]   Think like a Machine  Chapter 2  The availability  1 - output value of the neuron  constitutes a six-line vector. The following vector will be obtained by running the previous sample code on all six locations.  lv is the vector containing the value of each location for a given AGV to choose from. The values in the vector represent availability. 0.0002 means little availability. 0.9 means high availability. Once the choice is made, the reinforcement learning program presented in the first chapter will optimize the AGV's trajectory to get to this specific warehouse location.  The lv is the result of the weighing function of six potential locations for the AGV. It is also a vector of transformed inputs.

From there, the reward matrix for the MDP process described in the first chapter can be built.  Overall architecture At this point, the overall architecture contains two main components:  Chapter 1: Become an Adaptive Thinker: A reinforcement learning program based on the value-action Q function using a reward matrix that is yet to be calculated. The reward matrix was given in the first chapter, but in real life, you'll often have to build it from scratch. This could take weeks to obtain. Chapter 2: A set of six neurons that represent the flow of products at a given time at six locations. The output is the availability probability from 0 to 1. The highest value is the highest availability. The lowest value is the lowest availability.  At this point, there is some real-life information we can draw from these two main functions:  An AGV is moving in a warehouse and is waiting to receive its next location to use an MDP, in order to calculate an optimal trajectory of its mission, as shown in the first chapter. An AGV is using a reward matrix that was given in the first chapter, but it needs to be designed in a real-life project through meetings, reports, and acceptance of the process. A system of six neurons, one per location, weighing the real quantities and probable quantities to give an availability vector lv has been calculated. It is almost ready to provide the necessary reward matrix for the AGV.   To calculate the input values of the reward matrix in this reinforcement learning warehouse model, a bridge function between lv and the reward matrix R is missing.  That bridge function is a logistic classifier based on the outputs of the y neurons.  At this point, the system:  Took corporate data Used y neurons calculated with weights Applied an activation function   [ 38 ]   Think like a Machine  Chapter 2  The activation function in this model requires a logistic classifier, a commonly used one.  Logistic classifier The logistic classifier will be applied to lv  the six location values  to find the best location for the AGV. It is based on the output of the six neurons  input x weight + bias .  What are logistic functions? The goal of a logistic classifier is to produce a probability distribution from 0 to 1 for each value of the output vector. As you have seen so far, AI applications use applied mathematics with probable values, not raw outputs. In the warehouse model, the AGV needs to choose the best, most probable location, li. Even in a well-organized corporate warehouse, many uncertainties  late arrivals, product defects, or a number of unplanned problems  reduce the probability of a choice. A probability represents a value between 0  low probability  and 1  high probability . Logistic functions provide the tools to convert all numbers into probabilities between 0 and 1 to normalize data.  Logistic function The logistic sigmoid provides one of the best ways to normalize the weight of a given output. This will be used as the activation function of the neuron. The threshold is usually a value above which the neuron has a y=1 value; or else it has y=0. In this case, the minimum value will be 0 because the activation function will be more complex.  The logistic function is represented as follows.  e represents Euler's number, or 2.71828, the natural logarithm.  x is the value to be calculated. In this case, x is the result of the logistic sigmoid function.

To calculate the availability of the location once the 0.99 has been taken into account, we subtract the load from the total availability, which is 1, as follows:  As seen previously, once all locations are calculated in this manner, a final availability vector, lv, is obtained.  When analyzing lv, a problem has stopped the process. Individually, each line appears to be fine. By applying the logistic sigmoid to each output weight and subtracting it from 1, each location displays a probable availability between 0 and 1. However, the sum of the lines in lv exceeds 1. That is not possible. Probability cannot exceed 1. The program needs to fix that. In the source code, lv will be named  cid:90 .  Each line produces a [0,1] solution, which fits the prerequisite of being a valid probability.  In this case, the vector lv contains more than one value and becomes a multiple distribution. The sum of lv cannot exceed 1 and needs to be normalized.  The softmax function provides an excellent method to stabilize lv. Softmax is widely used in machine learning and deep learning.  Bear in mind that these mathematical tools are not rules. You can adapt them to your problem as much as you wish as long as your solution works.  [ 40 ]   Think like a Machine  Chapter 2  Softmax The softmax function appears in many artificial intelligence models to normalize data. This is a fundamental function to understand and master. In the case of the warehouse model, an AGV needs to make a probable choice between six locations in the lv vector. However, the total of the lv values exceeds 1. lv requires normalization of the softmax function S. In this sense, the softmax function can be considered as a generalization of the logistic sigmoid function. In the code, lv vector will be named  cid:90 .

In this warehouse case, it transforms lv into a decision-making process.   The last part of the softmax function requires  cid:84  cid:80  cid:71  cid:85  cid:78  cid:66  cid:89  cid:10  cid:77  cid:87  cid:11  to be rounded to 0 or 1.

In clear-cut transformations, the highest value will be close to 1 and the others will be closer to 0. In a decision-making process, the highest value needs to be found, as follows:   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:4  cid:73  cid:74  cid:72  cid:73  cid:70  cid:84  cid:85  cid:2  cid:87  cid:66  cid:77  cid:86  cid:70  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:84  cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:78  cid:70  cid:69  cid:2  cid:90  cid:2  cid:87  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:80  cid:83  cid:4  cid:14  cid:78  cid:66  cid:89  cid:10  cid:84  cid:80  cid:71  cid:85  cid:78  cid:66  cid:89  cid:10  cid:90  cid:19  cid:11  cid:11  cid:11   cid:5  cid:73  cid:74  cid:72  cid:73  cid:70  cid:84  cid:85  cid:2  cid:87  cid:66  cid:77  cid:86  cid:70  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:79  cid:80  cid:83  cid:78  cid:66  cid:77  cid:74  cid:91  cid:70  cid:69  cid:2  cid:90  cid:2  cid:87  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:20  cid:25  cid:21  cid:22  cid:21  cid:21  cid:23  cid:24  cid:23  cid:19  cid:27  cid:22   Once line 3  value  cid:18  cid:16  cid:20  cid:25  cid:21   has been chosen as the most probable location, it is set to 1 and the other, lower values are set to 0. This is called a one-hot function. This one-hot function is extremely helpful to encode the data provided. The vector obtained can now be applied to the reward matrix. The value 1 probability will become  cid:19  cid:18  cid:18  in the  cid:51  reward matrix, as follows.  The softmax function is now complete. Location l3 or C is the best solution for the AGV. The probability value is multiplied by 100 in the R function and the reward matrix described can now receive the input.   [ 42 ]   Think like a Machine  Chapter 2  Before continuing, take some time to play around with the values in the source code and run it to become familiar with softmax.  We now have the data for the reward matrix. The best way to understand the mathematical aspect of the project is to go to a paperboard and draw the result using the actual warehouse layout from locations A to F.  Locations={l1-A, l2-B, l3-C, l4-D, l5-E, l6-F}  Value of locations in the reward matrix={0,0,100,0,0,0} where C  the third value  is now the target for the self-driving vehicle, in this case, an AGV in a warehouse.  We obtain the following reward matrix  cid:51  described in the first chapter.  State values A A - B - C - D - E 1 F -  B - - - 1 - 1  C - - 100 1 - -  D - 1 1 - 1 -  E 1 - - 1 - -   cid:2   F - 1 - - - -  This reward matrix is exactly the one used in the Python reinforcement learning program using the Q function in the first chapter. The output of this chapter is the input of the  cid:51  matrix in the first chapter. The 0 values are there for the agent to avoid those values. This program is designed to stay close to probability standards with positive values, as shown in the following  cid:51  matrix.   cid:51  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:82  cid:77  cid:16  cid:78  cid:66  cid:85  cid:83  cid:74  cid:89  cid:10  cid:60  cid:2  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:62  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:18  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14   [ 43 ]   Think like a Machine  Chapter 2   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:60  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:2  cid:62  cid:11   At this point, the building blocks are in place to begin evaluating the results of the reinforcement learning program.   Summary Using a McCulloch-Pitts neuron with a logistic activation function in a one-layer network to build a reward matrix for reinforcement learning shows how to build real-life applications with AI technology.  Processing real-life data often requires a generalization of a logistic sigmoid function through a softmax function, and a one-hot function applied to logits to encode the data.   This shows that machine learning functions are tools that must be understood to be able to use all or parts of them to solve a problem. With this practical approach to artificial intelligence, a whole world of projects awaits you.  You can already use these first two chapters to present powerful trajectory models such as  Amazon warehouses and deliveries to your team or customers. Furthermore, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Netflix, and many others are growing their data centers as we speak. Each data center has locations with data flows that need to be calibrated. You can use the ideas given in this chapter to represent the problems and real-time calculations required to calibrate product and data flows.  This neuronal approach is the parent of the multi-layer perceptron that will be introduced in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:23 , Manage The Power of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

However, the intermediate or final results of these two functions need to be constantly measured. Good measurement solves a substantial part of a given problem since decisions rely on them. Reliable decisions are made with reliable evaluations. The goal of this chapter is to introduce measurement methods.  The key function of human intelligence, decision-making, relies on the ability to evaluate a situation. No decision can be made without measuring the pros and cons and factoring the parameters.  Mankind takes great pride in its ability to evaluate. However, in many cases, a machine can do better. Chess represents the pride of mankind in thinking strategy. A chessboard is often present in many movies to symbolize human intelligence.  Today, not a single chess player can beat the best chess engines. One of the extraordinary core capacities of a chess engine is the evaluation function; it takes many parameters into account more precisely than humans.  This chapter focuses on the main concepts of evaluation and measurement; they set the path to deep learning gradient descent-driven models, which will be explained in the following chapter.

Systems have a natural tendency to learn training sets through backpropagation. In this case, one set of company data is not enough.   In real-life company projects, a system will not be validated until tens of thousands of results have been produced. In some cases, a corporation will approve the system only after hundreds of datasets with millions of data samples have been tested to be sure that all scenarios are accurate. Each dataset represents a scenario consultants can work on with parameter scripts. The consultant introduces parameter scenarios that are tested by the system and measured. In systems with up to 200 parameters per neuron, a consultant will remain necessary for many years to come in an industrial environment. As of  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83   cid:22 , Become an Unconventional Innovator, the system will be on its own without the help of a consultant. Even then, consultants often are needed to manage the hyperparameters. In real-life systems, with high financial stakes, quality control will always remain essential.  Measurement should thus apply to generalization more than simply applying to a single or few datasets. Otherwise, you will have a natural tendency to control the parameters and overfit your model in a too-good-to-be-true scenario.  Beyond the reward matrix, the reinforcement program in the first chapter had a learning parameter  cid:102  =  cid:18  cid:16  cid:26 , as shown in the following code source.   cid:5  cid:2  cid:40  cid:66  cid:78  cid:78  cid:66  cid:2  cid:28  cid:2  cid:42  cid:85  cid:9  cid:84  cid:2  cid:66  cid:2  cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:78  cid:2  cid:80  cid:71  cid:2  cid:81  cid:70  cid:79  cid:66  cid:77  cid:85  cid:90  cid:2  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:86  cid:79  cid:68  cid:70  cid:83  cid:85  cid:66  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:90  cid:2  cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:77  cid:70  cid:66  cid:83  cid:79  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72   cid:5  cid:2  cid:42  cid:71  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:87  cid:66  cid:77  cid:86  cid:70  cid:2  cid:74  cid:84  cid:2  cid:19  cid:2  cid:14  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:83  cid:70  cid:88  cid:66  cid:83  cid:69  cid:84  cid:2  cid:88  cid:80  cid:86  cid:77  cid:69  cid:2  cid:67  cid:70  cid:2  cid:85  cid:80  cid:80  cid:2  cid:73  cid:74  cid:72  cid:73  cid:16   cid:5  cid:2  cid:53  cid:73  cid:74  cid:84  cid:2  cid:88  cid:66  cid:90  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:84  cid:90  cid:84  cid:85  cid:70  cid:78  cid:2  cid:76  cid:79  cid:80  cid:88  cid:84  cid:2  cid:74  cid:85  cid:2  cid:74  cid:84  cid:2  cid:77  cid:70  cid:66  cid:83  cid:79  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:16   cid:72  cid:66  cid:78  cid:78  cid:66  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:26   The  cid:102  learning parameter in itself needs to be closely monitored because it introduces uncertainty into the system. This means that the learning process will always remain a probability, never a certainty. One might wonder why this parameter is not just taken out. Paradoxically, that will lead to even more global uncertainty. The more the  cid:102  learning parameter tends to 1, the more you risk overfitting your results. Overfitting means that you are pushing the system to think it's learning well when it isn't. It's exactly like a teacher who gives high grades to everyone in the class all the time. The teacher would be overfitting the grade-student evaluation process, and nobody would know whether the students have learned something.  [ 48 ]   Apply Machine Thinking to a Human Problem  Chapter 3  The results of the reinforcement program need to be measured as they go through episodes. The range of the learning process itself must be measured. In the following code, the range is set to 50,000 to make sure the learning process reaches its goal.   cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:74  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:72  cid:70  cid:10  cid:23  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18  cid:11  cid:28   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:68  cid:86  cid:83  cid:83  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:64  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:82  cid:77  cid:16  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:80  cid:78  cid:16  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:18  cid:14  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:50  cid:16  cid:84  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:70  cid:60  cid:18  cid:62  cid:11  cid:11   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:49  cid:80  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:67  cid:77  cid:70  cid:34  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:81  cid:80  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:67  cid:77  cid:70  cid:64  cid:66  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:84  cid:10  cid:68  cid:86  cid:83  cid:83  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:64  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70  cid:11   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:66  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:34  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:36  cid:73  cid:80  cid:74  cid:68  cid:70  cid:10  cid:49  cid:80  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:67  cid:77  cid:70  cid:34  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:11   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:83  cid:70  cid:88  cid:66  cid:83  cid:69  cid:10  cid:68  cid:86  cid:83  cid:83  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:64  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70  cid:14  cid:66  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:14  cid:72  cid:66  cid:78  cid:78  cid:66  cid:11   All of these measurements will have a deep effect on the results obtained.  Convergence Building the system was fun. Finding the factors that make the system go wrong is another story.   The model presented so far can be summed up as follows:  From lv to R, the process creates the reward matrix   cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:20 , Think Like a Machine  required for the reinforcement learning program   cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19 , Become an Adaptive Thinker , which runs from reading R  reward matrix  to the results. Gamma is the learning parameter, Q is the Q learning function, and the results are the states of Q described in the first chapter.  The parameters to be measured are as follows:  The company's input data. The training sets found on the Web such as MNIST are designed to be efficient. These ready-made datasets often contain some noise  unreliable data  to make them realistic. The same process must be achieved with raw company data. The only problem is that you cannot download a corporate dataset from somewhere. You have to build the datasets. The weights and biases that will be applied. The activation function  a logistic function or other .  [ 49 ]   Apply Machine Thinking to a Human Problem  Chapter 3  The choices to make after the one-hot process. The learning parameter. Episode management through convergence.  The best way to start relies on measuring the quality of convergence of the system, the last step of the whole process.   If the system provides good convergence, it will avoid the headache of having to go back and check everything.  Implicit convergence In the last part of  cid:51  cid:70  cid:74  cid:79  cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:68  cid:70  cid:78  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:64  cid:45  cid:70  cid:66  cid:83  cid:79  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:64  cid:50  cid:64  cid:71  cid:86  cid:79  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  in the first chapter, a range of 50,000 is implemented.  The idea is to set the number of episodes at such a level that convergence is certain. In the following code, the range   cid:23  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18   is a constant.   cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:74  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:72  cid:70  cid:10  cid:23  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18  cid:11  cid:28   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:68  cid:86  cid:83  cid:83  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:64  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:82  cid:77  cid:16  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:80  cid:78  cid:16  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:18  cid:14  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:50  cid:16  cid:84  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:70  cid:60  cid:18  cid:62  cid:11  cid:11   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:49  cid:80  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:67  cid:77  cid:70  cid:34  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:81  cid:80  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:67  cid:77  cid:70  cid:64  cid:66  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:84  cid:10  cid:68  cid:86  cid:83  cid:83  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:64  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70  cid:11   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:66  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:34  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:36  cid:73  cid:80  cid:74  cid:68  cid:70  cid:10  cid:49  cid:80  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:67  cid:77  cid:70  cid:34  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:11   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:83  cid:70  cid:88  cid:66  cid:83  cid:69  cid:10  cid:68  cid:86  cid:83  cid:83  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:64  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70  cid:14  cid:66  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:14  cid:72  cid:66  cid:78  cid:78  cid:66  cid:11   Convergence, in this case, will be defined as the point at which no matter how long you run the system, the Q result matrix will not change anymore.  By setting the range to  cid:23  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18 , you can test and verify this. As long as the reward matrices remain homogeneous, this will work. If the reward matrices strongly vary from one scenario to another, this model will produce unstable results.  Try to run the program with different ranges. Lower the ranges until you see that the results are not optimal.   Numerical  cid:97   controlled convergence This approach can prove time-saving by using the target result, provided it exists beforehand. Training the reinforcement program in this manner validates the process.  [ 50 ]   Apply Machine Thinking to a Human Problem  Chapter 3  In the following source code, an intuitive cross-entropy function is introduced  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83   cid:27 , Getting Your Neurons to Work, for more on cross-entropy .  Cross-entropy refers to energy. The main concepts are as follows:  Energy represents the difference between one distribution and another It is what makes the system continue to train When a lot of training needs to be done, there is a high level of energy When the training reaches the end of its cycles, the level of energy is low In the following code, cross-entropy value  CEV  measures the difference between a target matrix and

A machine has a better one, in chess and a number of increasing fields. The problem now is to keep up with what the machines are learning!"                                                                                                                                                        -Denis Rothman  Evaluation is one of the major keys to efficient decision making in all fields: from chess, production management, rocket launching, and self-driving cars to data center calibration, software development, and airport schedules. Chess engines are not high-level deep- learning-based software. They rely heavily on evaluations and calculations. They evaluate much better than humans, and there is a lot to learn from them. The question now is to know whether any human can beat a chess engine or not. The answer is no.  To evaluate a position in chess, you need to examine all the pieces, their quantitative value, their qualitative value, cooperation between pieces, who owns each of the 64 squares, the king's safety, bishop pairs, knight positioning, and many other factors.  Evaluating a position in a chess game Evaluating a position in a chess game shows why machines will surpass humans in quite some decision-making fields within the next few years.  [ 52 ]   Apply Machine Thinking to a Human Problem  Chapter 3  The following position is after move 23 in the Kramnik-Bluebaum 2017 game. It cannot be correctly evaluated by humans. It contains too many parameters to analyze and too many possibilities.  It is white's turn to play, and a close analysis shows that both players are lost at this point. In a tournament like this, they must each continue to keep a poker face. They often look at the position with a confident face to hide their dismay. Some even shorten their thinking time to make their opponent think they know where they are going.   These unsolvable positions for humans are painless to solve with chess engines, even cheap, high-quality chess engines on a smartphone. This can be generalized to all human activity that has become increasingly complex, unpredictable and chaotic. Decision-makers will increasingly rely on artificial intelligence to help them make the right choices.   No human can play chess and evaluate the way a chess engine does by simply calculating the positions of the pieces, their squares of liberty, and many other parameters. A chess engine generates an evaluation matrix with millions of calculations. The following table is the result of an evaluation of only one position among many others  real and potential .

So white is winning by 34-33.7 = 0.3.   Chapter 3  4 3 Black:33,7  1 -2 2,7  The evaluation system can easily be represented with two McCulloch-Pitts neurons, one for black and one for white. Each neuron would have 30 weights = {w1,w2....w30}, as shown in the previous table. The sum of both neurons requires an activation function that converts the evaluation into 1 100th of a pawn, which is the standard measurement unit in chess. Each weight will be the output of squares and piece calculations. Then the MDP can be applied to Bellman's equation with a random generator of possible positions.  Present-day chess engines contain barely more intelligence than this type of pure calculation approach. They don't need more to beat humans.  No human, not even world champions, can calculate this position with this accuracy. The number of parameters to take into account overwhelms them each time they reach a position like this. They then play more or less randomly with some kind of idea in mind. It resembles a lottery sometimes. Chess expert annotators discover this when they run human-played games with powerful chess engines to check the game. The players themselves now tend to reveal their incapacity when questioned.   Now bear in mind that the position analyzed represents only one possibility. A chess engine will test millions of possibilities. Humans can test only a few.  Measuring a result like this has nothing to do with natural human thinking. Only machines can think like that. Not only do chess engines solve the problem, but also they are impossible to beat.  At one point, there are problems humans face that only machines can solve.  [ 55 ]   Apply Machine Thinking to a Human Problem  Chapter 3  Applying the evaluation and convergence process to a business problem What was once considered in chess as the ultimate proof of human intelligence has been battered by brute-force calculations with great CPU RAM capacity. Almost any human problem requiring logic and reasoning can most probably be solved by a machine using relatively elementary processes expressed in mathematical terms.  Let's take the result matrix of the reinforcement learning example of the first chapter. It can also be viewed as a scheduling tool. Automated planning and scheduling have become a crucial artificial intelligence field, as explained in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:20 , Automated Planning and Scheduling. In this case, evaluating and measuring the result goes beyond convergence aspects.  In a scheduling process, the input of the reward matrix can represent the priorities of the packaging operation of some products in a warehouse. It would determine in which order customer products must be picked to be packaged and delivered. These priorities extend to the use of a machine that will automatically package the products in a FIFO mode  first in, first out . The systems provide good solutions, but, in real life, many unforeseen events change the order of flows in a warehouse and practically all schedules.  In this case, the result matrix can be transformed into a vector of a scheduled packaging sequence. The packaging department will follow the priorities produced by the system.

The only way to be sure that this whole system works is to run thousands of datasets with hundreds of thousands of product flows.  The idea now is to use supervised learning to create relationships between the input and output data. It's not a random process like MDP. They are not trajectories anymore. They are priorities. One method is to used decision trees. In  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:22 , Become an Unconventional Innovator, the problem will be solved with a feedforward backpropagation network.  In this model, the properties of the customer orders are analyzed so that we can classify them. This can be translated into decision trees depending on real-time data, to create a distribution representation to predict future outcomes.  1.  The first step is to represent the properties of the orders O1 to O6.   cid:71  cid:70  cid:66  cid:85  cid:86  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:60  cid:2  cid:9  cid:49  cid:83  cid:74  cid:80  cid:83  cid:74  cid:85  cid:90  cid:17  cid:77  cid:80  cid:68  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:9  cid:14  cid:2  cid:9  cid:55  cid:80  cid:77  cid:86  cid:78  cid:70  cid:9  cid:14  cid:2  cid:9  cid:39  cid:77  cid:80  cid:88  cid:64  cid:80  cid:81  cid:85  cid:74  cid:78  cid:74  cid:91  cid:70  cid:83  cid:9  cid:2  cid:62   In this case, we will limit the model to three properties:  Priority location, which is the most important property in a warehouse flow in this model Volumes to transport Optimizing priority cid:100 the financial and customer satisfaction property  [ 58 ]   Apply Machine Thinking to a Human Problem  Chapter 3  2.  The second step is to provide some priority parameters to the learning dataset:   cid:58  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:60  cid:9  cid:45  cid:80  cid:88  cid:9  cid:14  cid:2  cid:9  cid:45  cid:80  cid:88  cid:9  cid:14  cid:2  cid:9  cid:41  cid:74  cid:72  cid:73  cid:9  cid:14  cid:2  cid:9  cid:41  cid:74  cid:72  cid:73  cid:9  cid:14  cid:2  cid:9  cid:45  cid:80  cid:88  cid:9  cid:14  cid:2  cid:9  cid:45  cid:80  cid:88   3.  Step 3 is providing the dataset input matrix, which is the output matrix of the reinforcement learning program. The values have been approximated but are enough to run the model. This simulates some of the intermediate decisions and transformations that occur during the decision process  ratios applied, uncertainty factors added, and other parameters . The input matrix is  cid:57 :   cid:57  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:60  cid:2  cid:60  cid:20  cid:23  cid:24  cid:14  cid:2  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:60  cid:21  cid:20  cid:18  cid:14  cid:2  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:60  cid:23  cid:18  cid:18  cid:14  cid:2  cid:19  cid:14  cid:19  cid:62  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:60  cid:22  cid:18  cid:18  cid:14  cid:2  cid:19  cid:14  cid:19  cid:62  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:60  cid:21  cid:20  cid:18  cid:14  cid:2  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:60  cid:20  cid:23  cid:24  cid:14  cid:2  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:62   The features in step 1 apply to each column.  The values in step 2 apply to every line.  4.  Step 4 is running a standard decision tree classifier. This classifier will distribute the representations  distributed representations  into two categories:  The properties of high-priority orders The properties of low-priority orders  There are many types of algorithms. In this case, a standard  cid:84  cid:76  cid:77  cid:70  cid:66  cid:83  cid:79  function is called to do the job, as shown in the following source code.   cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:90  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:85  cid:83  cid:70  cid:70  cid:16  cid:37  cid:70  cid:68  cid:74  cid:84  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:53  cid:83  cid:70  cid:70  cid:36  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:74  cid:70  cid:83  cid:10  cid:11   cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:90  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:90  cid:16  cid:71  cid:74  cid:85  cid:10  cid:57  cid:14  cid:58  cid:11   Applied to thousands of orders on a given day, it will help adapt to real-time unplanned events that destabilize all scheduling systems: late trucks, bad quality products, robot breakdowns, and absent personnel. This means that the system must be able to constantly adapt to new situations and provide priorities to replan in real time.   [ 59 ]   Apply Machine Thinking to a Human Problem  Chapter 3  The program will produce the following graph, which separates the orders into priority groups.  The goal now is to separate the best orders to replan among hundreds of thousands of simulating orders. In this case, the learning dataset has the six values you have been studying in the first two chapters from various angles.  Priority location<=360.0 is the division point between the most probable optimized orders  high  and less interesting ones  low . Gini impurity. This would be the measure of incorrect labeling if the choice were random. In this case, the dataset is stable. The false arrow points out the two values that are not <=360, meaning they are good choices, the optimal separation line of the representation. The ones that are not classified as  cid:39  cid:66  cid:77  cid:84  cid:70  are considered as don't eliminate orders. The  cid:53  cid:83  cid:86  cid:70  elements mean: eliminate orders as long as possible. The value result reads as [number of false elements, number of true elements] of the dataset.  If you play around with the values in steps 1, 2, and 3, you'll obtain different separation points and values. This sandbox program will prepare you for the more complex scheduling problems of  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:20 , Automated Planning and Scheduling.

This is done to generalize these distributed representations directly to the warehouse data to improve the initial corporate data inputs. With better-proven priorities, the system will constantly improve, week by week.  This way of scheduling shows that human thinking was not used nor necessary.  Contrary to the hype surrounding artificial intelligence, most problems can be solved with no human intelligence involved and relatively little machine learning technology.  Human intelligence simply proves that intelligence can solve a problem.

[ 61 ]   Apply Machine Thinking to a Human Problem  Chapter 3  Summary This chapter led artificial intelligence exploration one more step away from neuroscience to reproduce human thinking. Solving a problem like a machine means using a chain of mathematical functions and properties.  The further you get in machine learning and deep learning, the more you will find mathematical functions that solve the core problems. Contrary to the astounding amount of hype, mathematics relying on CPUs is replacing humans, not some form of alien intelligence.  The power of machine learning with beyond-human mathematical reasoning is that generalization to other fields is easier. A mathematical model, contrary to the complexity of humans entangled in emotions, makes it easier to deploy the same model in many fields. The models of the first three chapters can be used for self-driving vehicles, drones, robots in a warehouse, scheduling priorities, and much more. Try to imagine as many fields you can apply these to as possible.  Evaluation and measurement are at the core of machine learning and deep learning. The key factor is constantly monitoring convergence between the results the system produces and the goal it must attain. This opens the door to the constant adaptation of the weights of the network to reach its objectives.  Machine evaluation for convergence through a chess example that has nothing to do with human thinking proves the limits of human intelligence. The decision tree example can beat most humans in classification situations where large amounts of data are involved.  Human intelligence is not being reproduced in many cases and has often been surpassed. In those cases, human intelligence just proves that intelligence can solve a problem, nothing more.  The next chapter goes a step further from human reasoning with self-weighting neural networks and introduces deep learning.

At that point, you try everything you learned, but it doesn't work for what's asked of you. Your team or customer begins to look elsewhere. It's time to react.  In this chapter, an impossible-to-solve business case regarding material optimization will be implemented successfully with an example of a feedforward neural network  FNN  with backpropagation.    Feedforward networks are the building blocks of deep learning. The battle around the XOR function perfectly illustrates how deep learning regained popularity in corporate environments. The XOR FNN illustrates one of the critical functions of neural networks: classification. Once information becomes classified into subsets, it opens the doors to prediction and many other functions of neural networks, such as representation learning.  An XOR FNN network will be built from scratch to demystify deep learning from the start. A vintage, start-from-scratch method will be applied, blowing the deep learning hype off the table.  The following topics will be covered in this chapter:  How to hand build an FNN Solving XOR with an FNN Classification Backpropagation A cost function   Become an Unconventional Innovator  Chapter 4  Cost function optimization Error loss Convergence  Technical requirements  Python 3.6x 64-bit from  cid:73  cid:85  cid:85  cid:81  cid:84  cid:28  cid:17  cid:17  cid:88  cid:88  cid:88  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  cid:85  cid:73  cid:80  cid:79  cid:16  cid:80  cid:83  cid:72  cid:17  NumPy for Python 3.6x  Programs from GitHub  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:18  cid:22 :   cid:39  cid:47  cid:47  cid:64  cid:57  cid:48  cid:51  cid:64  cid:87  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:66  cid:72  cid:70  cid:64  cid:85  cid:83  cid:74  cid:67  cid:86  cid:85  cid:70  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90    cid:39  cid:39  cid:47  cid:64  cid:57  cid:48  cid:51  cid:64  cid:72  cid:70  cid:79  cid:70  cid:83  cid:66  cid:77  cid:74  cid:91  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90   Check out the following video to see the code in action:   cid:73  cid:85  cid:85  cid:81  cid:84  cid:28  cid:17  cid:17  cid:72  cid:80  cid:80  cid:16  cid:72  cid:77  cid:17  cid:34  cid:52  cid:90  cid:45  cid:56  cid:91   The XOR limit of the original perceptron Once the feedforward network for solving the XOR problem is built, it will be applied to a material optimization business case. The material-optimizing solution will choose the best combinations of dimensions among billions to minimize the use of a material with the generalization of the XOR function. First, a solution to the XOR limitation of a perceptron must be fully clarified.  XOR and linearly separable models In the academic world, like the private world, competition exists. Such a situation took place in 1969. Minsky and Papert published Perceptrons. They proved mathematically that a perceptron could not solve an XOR function. Fortunately, today the perceptron and its neocognitron version form the core model for neural networking.    One might be tempted to think, So what? However, the entire field of neural networks relies on solving problems such as this to classify patterns. Without pattern classification, images, sounds, and words mean nothing to a machine.  [ 65 ]   Become an Unconventional Innovator  Chapter 4  Linearly separable models The McCulloch-Pitts 1943 neuron  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:20 , Think Like a Machine  lead to Rosenblatt's 1957-1962 perceptron and the 1960 Widrow-Hoff adaptive linear element  Adaline .  These models are linear models based on f x,w , requiring a line to separate results. A  perceptron cannot achieve this goal and thus cannot classify many objects it faces.  A standard linear function can separate values. Linear separability can be represented in the following graph:  Imagine that the line separating the preceding dots and the part under it represent a picture that needs to be represented by a machine learning or deep learning application. The dots above the line represent clouds in the sky; the dots below the line represent trees on a hill. The line represents the slope of that hill.  To be linearly separable, a function must be able to separate the clouds from the trees to classify them. The prerequisite to classification is separability of some sort, linear or nonlinear.  [ 66 ]   Become an Unconventional Innovator  Chapter 4  The XOR limit of a linear model, such as the original perceptron A linear model cannot solve the XOR problem expressed as follows in a table:  Value of x1 Value of x2 Output 1 0 1 0  0 0 1 1  1 0 0 1  The following graph shows the linear inseparability of the XOR function represented by one perceptron:  The values of the table represent the Cartesian coordinates in this graph. The circle with a cross at  1,1  and  0,0  cannot be separated from the circles at  1,0  and  0,11 . That's a huge problem. It means that Frank Rosenblatt's f x,w  perceptron cannot separate, and thus not classify, these dots into clouds and trees; an object used to identify that requires linear separability. Having invented the most powerful concept of the 20th century cid:100 a neuron that can learn cid:100 Frank Rosenblatt had to bear with this limitation through the 1960s.  Let's vindicate this injustice with a vintage solution.  [ 67 ]   Become an Unconventional Innovator  Chapter 4  Building a feedforward neural network from scratch Let's get into a time machine. In nanoseconds, it takes us back to 1969. We have today's knowledge but nothing to prove it. Minsky and Papert have just published their book, Perceptrons. They've proven that a perceptron cannot implement the exclusive OR function XOR.  We are puzzled. We know that deep learning will be a great success in the 21st century. We want to try to change the course of history. Thanks to our time machine, we land in a small apartment. It's comfortable, with a vinyl record playing the music we like! There is a mahogany desk with a pad, a pencil, sharpener, and eraser waiting for us. We sit. A warm cup of coffee appears in a big mug. We're ready to solve the XOR problem from scratch. We have to find a way to classify those dots with a neural network.  Step 1  cid:97  Defining a feedforward neural network We look at our piece of paper. We don't have a computer. We're going to have to write code; then we'll hopefully find a computer in a university or a corporation that has a 1960 state-of-the-art language to program in.  We have to be unconventional to solve this problem. First, we must ignore Minsky and Papert's publication and also forget complicated words and theory of the 21st century. In fact, we don't remember much anyway. Time travel made our future fuzzy!  A perceptron is usually represented by a graph. But that doesn't mean much right now. After all, I can't compute circles and lines. In fact, beyond seeing circles and lines, we type characters in computer languages, not circles. So, I decide to simply to write a layer in high- school format. A hidden layer will simply be:   Ok, now I have one layer. In fact, I just realized that a layer is merely a function. This function can be expressed as:   cid:2   [ 68 ]   Become an Unconventional Innovator  Chapter 4  In which x is the input value and w is some kind of value to multiply x by. I also realized that hidden just means that it's the computation, just as x=2 and x+2 is the hidden layer that leads to 4.  At this point, I've defined a neural network in three lines:   Input x. Some kind of function that changes its value, like 2 x 2 = 4, which transformed 2. That is a layer. And if the result is superior to 2, for example, then great! The  output is 1, meaning yes or true. Since we don't see the computation, this is the hidden layer.  An output.  Now that I know that basically any neural network is built with values transformed by an operation to become an output of something, I need the logic to solve the XOR problem.  Step 2  cid:97  how two children solve the XOR problem every day Let's see how two children solve the XOR problem using a plain everyday example. I strongly recommend this method. I have taken very complex problems, broken them down into small parts to children's level, and often solved them in a few minutes. Then, you get the sarcastic answer from others such as Is that all you did? But, the sarcasm vanishes when the solution works over and over again in high-level corporate projects.  First, let's convert the XOR problem into a candy problem in a store. Two children go to the store and want to buy candy. However, they only have enough money to buy one pack of candy. They have to agree on a choice between two packs of different candy. Let's say pack one is chocolate and the other is chewing gum. Then, during the discussion between these two children, 1 means yes, 0 means no. Their budget limits the options of these two children:  Going to the store and not buying any of chocolate or chewing gum = no, no  0,0 . That's not an option for these children! So the answer is false. Going to the store and buying both chocolate and chewing gum = yes, yes  1,1 . That would be fantastic, but that's not possible. It's too expensive. So, the answer is unfortunately false. Going to the store and either buying chocolate or chewing gum =  1,0 or 0,1  = yes or no no or yes. That's possible. So, the answer is true.  [ 69 ]   Become an Unconventional Innovator  Chapter 4  Sipping my coffee in 1969, I imagine the two children. The eldest one is reasonable. The younger one doesn't know really how to count yet and wants to buy both packs of candy.  I decide to write that down on my piece of paper:  x1  eldest child's decision yes or no, 1 or 0  * w1  what the elder child thinks . The elder child is thinking this, or:  The elder child weighs a decision like we all do every day, such as purchasing a car  x=0 or 1  multiplied by the cost  w1 .  x2  the younger child's decision yes or no, 1 or 0  * w3  what the younger child thinks . The younger child is also thinking this, or:  Theory: x1 and x2 are the inputs. h1 and h2 are neurons  the result of a calculation . Since h1 and h2 contain calculations that are not visible during the process, they are hidden neurons. h1 and h2 thus form a hidden layer.   Now I imagine the two children talking to each other.  Hold it a minute! This means that now each child is communicating with the other:  x1  the elder child  says w2 to the younger child. Thus w2 = this is what I think and am telling you:  x2  the younger child  says please add my views to your decision, which is represented by: w4  [ 70 ]   Become an Unconventional Innovator  Chapter 4  I now have the first two equations expressed in high-school-level code. It's what one thinks + what one says to the other asking the other to take that into account:   cid:73  cid:19  cid:31  cid:10  cid:89  cid:19  cid:12  cid:88  cid:19  cid:11  cid:13  cid:10  cid:89  cid:20  cid:12  cid:88  cid:22  cid:11  cid:2  cid:5  cid:42  cid:42  cid:16  cid:34  cid:16  cid:88  cid:70  cid:74  cid:72  cid:73  cid:85  cid:2  cid:80  cid:71  cid:2  cid:73  cid:74  cid:69  cid:69  cid:70  cid:79  cid:2  cid:79  cid:70  cid:86  cid:83  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:73  cid:19   cid:73  cid:20  cid:31  cid:10  cid:89  cid:20  cid:12  cid:88  cid:21  cid:11  cid:13  cid:10  cid:89  cid:19  cid:12  cid:88  cid:20  cid:11  cid:2  cid:5  cid:42  cid:42  cid:16  cid:35  cid:16  cid:88  cid:70  cid:74  cid:72  cid:73  cid:85  cid:2  cid:80  cid:71  cid:2  cid:73  cid:74  cid:69  cid:69  cid:70  cid:79  cid:2  cid:79  cid:70  cid:86  cid:83  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:73  cid:20    cid:73  cid:19  sums up what is going on in one child's mind: personal opinion + other child's opinion.   cid:73  cid:20  sums up what is going on in the other child's mind and conversation: personal opinion + other child's opinion.  Theory. The calculation now contains two input values and one hidden layer. Since in the next step we are going to apply calculations to  cid:73  cid:19  and  cid:73  cid:20 , we are in a feedforward neural network. We are moving from the input to another layer, which will lead us to another layer, and so on. This process of going from one layer to another is the basis of deep learning. The more layers you have, the deeper the network is. The reason  cid:73  cid:19  and  cid:73  cid:20  form a hidden layer is that their output is just the input of another layer.   I don't have time to deal with complicated numbers in an activation function such as logistic sigmoid, so I decide to simply decide whether the output values are less than 1 or not:  if h1+h2 >=1 then y1=1  if h1+h2<1 then y2=0  Theory: y1 and y2 form a second hidden layer. These variables can be scalars, vectors, or matrices. They are neurons.   Now, a problem comes up. Who is right? The elder child or the younger child?  The only way seems to be to play around, with the weights W representing all the weights.  I decided that at this point, I liked both children. Why would I have to hurt one of them? So from now on, w3=w2,w4=w1. After all, I don't have a computer and my time travel window is consuming a lot of energy. I'm going to be pulled back soon.  Now, somebody has to be an influencer. Let's leave this hard task to the elder child. The elder child, being more reasonable, will continuously deliver the bad news. You have to subtract something from your choice, represented by a minus  -  sign.    [ 71 ]   Become an Unconventional Innovator  Chapter 4  Each time they reach the point hi, the eldest child applies a critical negative view on purchasing packs of candy. It's -w of everything comes up to be sure not to go over the budget. The opinion of the elder child is biased, so let's call the variable a bias, b1. Since the younger child's opinion is biased as well, let's call this view a bias too b2. Since the eldest child's view is always negative, -b1 will be applied to all of the eldest child's thoughts.   When we apply this decision process to their view, we obtain:  Then, we just have to use the same result. If the result is >=1 then the threshold has been reached. The threshold is calculated as shown in the following function.  Since I don't have a computer, I decide to start finding the weights in a practical manner, starting by setting the weights and biases to 0.5, as follows:  It's not a full program yet, but its theory is done.   Only the communication going on between the two children is making the difference; I focus on only modifying w2 and b1 after a first try. An hour later, on paper, it works!  I can't believe that this is all there is to it. I copy the mathematical process on a clean sheet of paper:   cid:52  cid:80  cid:77  cid:86  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:85  cid:80  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:57  cid:48  cid:51  cid:2  cid:74  cid:78  cid:81  cid:77  cid:70  cid:78  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:88  cid:74  cid:85  cid:73   cid:66  cid:2  cid:71  cid:70  cid:70  cid:69  cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:88  cid:66  cid:83  cid:69  cid:2  cid:79  cid:70  cid:86  cid:83  cid:66  cid:77  cid:2  cid:79  cid:70  cid:85  cid:88  cid:80  cid:83  cid:76  cid:10  cid:39  cid:47  cid:47  cid:11    cid:42  cid:16  cid:52  cid:70  cid:85  cid:85  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:71  cid:74  cid:83  cid:84  cid:85  cid:2  cid:88  cid:70  cid:74  cid:72  cid:73  cid:85  cid:84  cid:2  cid:85  cid:80  cid:2  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:83  cid:85  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:81  cid:83  cid:80  cid:68  cid:70  cid:84  cid:84   cid:88  cid:19  cid:31  cid:18  cid:16  cid:23  cid:29  cid:88  cid:20  cid:31  cid:18  cid:16  cid:23  cid:29  cid:67  cid:19  cid:31  cid:18  cid:16  cid:23   cid:88  cid:21  cid:31  cid:88  cid:20  cid:29  cid:88  cid:22  cid:31  cid:88  cid:19  cid:29  cid:67  cid:20  cid:31  cid:67  cid:19    cid:5  cid:42  cid:42  cid:2  cid:73  cid:74  cid:69  cid:69  cid:70  cid:79  cid:2  cid:77  cid:66  cid:90  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:5  cid:19  cid:2  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:2  cid:74  cid:85  cid:84  cid:2  cid:80  cid:86  cid:85  cid:81  cid:86  cid:85   cid:73  cid:19  cid:31  cid:10  cid:89  cid:19  cid:12  cid:88  cid:19  cid:11  cid:13  cid:10  cid:89  cid:20  cid:12  cid:88  cid:22  cid:11  cid:2  cid:5  cid:42  cid:42  cid:16  cid:34  cid:16  cid:88  cid:70  cid:74  cid:72  cid:73  cid:85  cid:2  cid:80  cid:71  cid:2  cid:73  cid:74  cid:69  cid:69  cid:70  cid:79  cid:2  cid:79  cid:70  cid:86  cid:83  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:73  cid:19   cid:73  cid:20  cid:31  cid:10  cid:89  cid:20  cid:12  cid:88  cid:21  cid:11  cid:13  cid:10  cid:89  cid:19  cid:12  cid:88  cid:20  cid:11  cid:2  cid:5  cid:42  cid:42  cid:16  cid:35  cid:16  cid:88  cid:70  cid:74  cid:72  cid:73  cid:85  cid:2  cid:80  cid:71  cid:2  cid:73  cid:74  cid:69  cid:69  cid:70  cid:79  cid:2  cid:79  cid:70  cid:86  cid:83  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:73  cid:20    cid:5  cid:42  cid:42  cid:42  cid:16  cid:85  cid:73  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:73  cid:80  cid:77  cid:69  cid:2  cid:42  cid:14  cid:2  cid:73  cid:74  cid:69  cid:69  cid:70  cid:79  cid:2  cid:77  cid:66  cid:90  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:20   cid:74  cid:71  cid:10  cid:73  cid:19  cid:32  cid:31  cid:19  cid:11  cid:28  cid:73  cid:19  cid:31  cid:19  cid:29   [ 72 ]   Become an Unconventional Innovator  Chapter 4   cid:74  cid:71  cid:10  cid:73  cid:19  cid:30  cid:19  cid:11  cid:28  cid:73  cid:19  cid:31  cid:18  cid:29   cid:74  cid:71  cid:10  cid:73  cid:20  cid:32  cid:31  cid:19  cid:11  cid:28  cid:73  cid:20  cid:31  cid:19   cid:74  cid:71  cid:10  cid:73  cid:20  cid:30  cid:19  cid:11  cid:28  cid:73  cid:20  cid:31  cid:18   cid:73  cid:19  cid:31  cid:2  cid:73  cid:19  cid:2  cid:12  cid:2  cid:15  cid:67  cid:19   cid:73  cid:20  cid:31  cid:2  cid:73  cid:20  cid:2  cid:12  cid:2  cid:67  cid:20    cid:42  cid:55  cid:16  cid:53  cid:73  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:73  cid:80  cid:77  cid:69  cid:2  cid:42  cid:42  cid:2  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:2  cid:39  cid:74  cid:79  cid:66  cid:77  cid:2  cid:48  cid:54  cid:53  cid:49  cid:54  cid:53  cid:2  cid:90   cid:90  cid:31  cid:73  cid:19  cid:13  cid:73  cid:20   cid:74  cid:71  cid:10  cid:90  cid:32  cid:31  cid:19  cid:11  cid:28  cid:90  cid:31  cid:19   cid:74  cid:71  cid:10  cid:90  cid:30  cid:19  cid:11  cid:28  cid:90  cid:31  cid:18    cid:55  cid:16  cid:2  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:79  cid:72  cid:70  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:68  cid:83  cid:74  cid:85  cid:74  cid:68  cid:66  cid:77  cid:2  cid:88  cid:70  cid:74  cid:72  cid:73  cid:85  cid:84  cid:2  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:2  cid:85  cid:83  cid:90  cid:2  cid:66  cid:72  cid:66  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:86  cid:79  cid:85  cid:74  cid:77  cid:2  cid:66  cid:2  cid:84  cid:80  cid:77  cid:86  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:74  cid:84  cid:2  cid:71  cid:80  cid:86  cid:79  cid:69   cid:88  cid:20  cid:31  cid:88  cid:20  cid:13  cid:18  cid:16  cid:23   cid:67  cid:19  cid:31  cid:67  cid:19  cid:13  cid:18  cid:16  cid:23   I'm overexcited by the solution. I need to get this little sheet of paper to a newspaper to get it published and change the course of history. I rush to the door, open it but find myself back in the present! I jump and wake up in my bedroom sweating.  I rush to my laptop while this time-travel dream is fresh in my mind to get it into Python for this book.  Why wasn't this deceiving simple solution found in 1969? Because it seems simple today but wasn't so at that time like all inventions found by our genius predecessors. Nothing is easy at all in artificial intelligence and mathematics.  Implementing a vintage XOR solution in Python with an FNN and backpropagation I'm still thinking that implementing XOR with so little mathematics might not be that simple. However, since the basic rule of innovating is to be unconventional, I write the code.  To stay in the spirit of a 1969 vintage solution, I decide not to use NumPy, TensorFlow, Theano, or any other high-level library. Writing a vintage FNN with backpropagation written in high-school mathematics is fun.  This also shows that if you break a problem down into very elementary parts, you understand it better and provide a solution to that specific problem. You don't need to use a huge truck to transport a loaf of bread.  [ 73 ]   Become an Unconventional Innovator  Chapter 4  Furthermore, by thinking through the minds of children, I went against running 20,000 or more episodes in modern CPU-rich solutions to solve the XOR problem. The logic used proves that, basically, both inputs can have the same parameters as long as one bias is negative  the elder reasonable critical child  to make the system provide a reasonable answer.  The basic Python solution quickly reaches a result in 3 to 10 iterations  epochs or episodes  depending on how we think it through.  The top of the code simply contains a result matrix with four columns. Each represents the status   cid:19 =correct,  cid:18 =false  of the four predicates to solve:   cid:5  cid:39  cid:38  cid:38  cid:37  cid:39  cid:48  cid:51  cid:56  cid:34  cid:51  cid:37  cid:2  cid:47  cid:38  cid:54  cid:51  cid:34  cid:45  cid:2  cid:47  cid:38  cid:53  cid:56  cid:48  cid:51  cid:44  cid:10  cid:39  cid:47  cid:47  cid:11  cid:2  cid:56  cid:42  cid:53  cid:41  cid:2  cid:35  cid:34  cid:36  cid:44  cid:2  cid:49  cid:51  cid:48  cid:49  cid:34  cid:40  cid:34  cid:53  cid:42  cid:48  cid:47  cid:2  cid:52  cid:48  cid:45  cid:54  cid:53  cid:42  cid:48  cid:47  cid:2  cid:39  cid:48  cid:51  cid:2  cid:57  cid:48  cid:51   cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:86  cid:77  cid:85  cid:31  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:2  cid:5  cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:74  cid:79  cid:70  cid:69  cid:2  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:86  cid:77  cid:85   cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:74  cid:79  cid:31  cid:22  cid:2  cid:5  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:84  cid:70  cid:85  cid:2  cid:84  cid:74  cid:91  cid:70  cid:2  cid:85  cid:80  cid:2  cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:74  cid:79   The train variable is the number of predicates to solve:  0,0 ,  1,1 , 1,0 , 0,1 .

To do that, we need to measure the number of predictions, 1 to 4, that are correct at each iteration and decide how to change the weights biases until we obtain proper results.  [ 75 ]   Become an Unconventional Innovator  Chapter 4  A slightly more complex gradient descent will be described in the next chapter. In this chapter, only a one-line equation will do the job. The only thing to bear in mind as an unconventional thinker is: so what? The concept of gradient descent is minimizing loss or errors between the present result and a goal to attain.  First, a cost function is needed.  There are four predicates  0-0, 1-1, 1-0, 0-1  to train correctly. We simply need to find out how many are correctly trained at each epoch.  The cost function will measure the difference between the training goal  4  and the result of this epoch or training iteration  result .  When 0 convergence is reached, it means the training has succeeded.   cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:86  cid:77  cid:85  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  contains a  cid:18  for each value if none of the four predicates has been trained correctly.  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:86  cid:77  cid:85  cid:60  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  means two out of four predicates are correct.  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:86  cid:77  cid:85  cid:60  cid:19  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:19  cid:62  means that all four predicates have been trained and that the training can stop.  cid:19 , in this case, means that the correct training result was obtained. It can be  cid:18  or  cid:19 . The  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:86  cid:77  cid:85  array is the result counter.  The cost function will express this training by having a value of  cid:22 ,  cid:21 ,  cid:20 ,  cid:19 , or  cid:18  as the training goes down the slope to  cid:18 .  Gradient descent measures the value of the descent to find the direction of the slope: up, down, or 0. Then, once you have that slope and the steepness of it, you can optimize the weights. A derivative is a way to know whether you are going up or down a slope.  In this case, I hijacked the concept and used it to set the learning rate with a one-line function. Why not? It helped to solve gradient descent optimization in one line:   cid:74  cid:71  cid:10  cid:68  cid:80  cid:79  cid:87  cid:70  cid:83  cid:72  cid:70  cid:79  cid:68  cid:70  cid:30  cid:18  cid:11  cid:28  cid:88  cid:20  cid:13  cid:31  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:23  cid:29  cid:67  cid:19  cid:31  cid:88  cid:20   By applying the vintage children buying candy logic to the whole XOR problem, I found that only  cid:88  cid:20  needed to be optimized. That's why  cid:67  cid:19  cid:31  cid:88  cid:20 . That's because  cid:67  cid:19  is doing the tough job of saying something negative  -  all the time, which completely changes the course of the resulting outputs.  [ 76 ]   Become an Unconventional Innovator  Chapter 4  The rate is set at  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:23 , and the program finishes training in 10 epochs:   cid:70  cid:81  cid:80  cid:68  cid:73  cid:28  cid:2  cid:19  cid:18  cid:2  cid:80  cid:81  cid:85  cid:74  cid:78  cid:74  cid:91  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:18  cid:2  cid:88  cid:19  cid:28  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:23  cid:2  cid:88  cid:20  cid:28  cid:2  cid:19  cid:16  cid:18  cid:2  cid:88  cid:21  cid:28  cid:2  cid:19  cid:16  cid:18  cid:2  cid:88  cid:22  cid:28  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:23  cid:2  cid:67  cid:19  cid:28  cid:2  cid:15  cid:19  cid:16  cid:18  cid:2  cid:67  cid:20  cid:28  cid:2  cid:19  cid:16  cid:18   This is not a mathematical calculation problem but a logical one, a yes or no problem. The way the network is built is pure logic. Nothing can stop us from using whatever training rates we wish. In fact, that's what gradient descent is about. There are many gradient descent methods.

Linear separability was achieved Bear in mind that the whole purpose of this feedforward network with backpropagation through a cost function was to transform a linear non-separable function into a linearly separable function to implement classification of features presented to the system. In this case, the features had  cid:18  or  cid:19  value.  One of the core goals of a layer in a neural network is to make the input make sense, meaning to be able to separate one kind of information from another.   cid:73  cid:19  and  cid:73  cid:20  will produce the Cartesian coordinate linear separability training axis, as implemented in the following code:   cid:73  cid:19  cid:31  cid:2  cid:73  cid:19  cid:2  cid:12  cid:2  cid:15  cid:67  cid:19   cid:73  cid:20  cid:31  cid:2  cid:73  cid:20  cid:2  cid:12  cid:2  cid:67  cid:20   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:73  cid:19  cid:14  cid:73  cid:20  cid:11   Running the program provides a view of the nonlinear input values once they have been trained by the hidden layers.

We now have clouds on top and trees below the line that separates them.

From this technique, many operations can be performed on data, such as subset optimization.  [ 79 ]   Become an Unconventional Innovator  Chapter 4  Applying the FNN XOR solution to a case study to optimize subsets of data The case study described here is a real-life project. The environment and functions have been modified to respect confidentiality. But, the philosophy is the same one as that used and worked on.  We are 7.5 billion people breathing air on this planet. In 2050, there will be about 2.5 billion more. All of these people need to wear clothes and eat. Just those two activities involve classifying data into subsets for industrial purposes. Grouping is a core concept for any kind of production. Production relating to producing clothes and food requires grouping to optimize production costs. Imagine not grouping and delivering one t-shirt at a time from one continent to another instead of grouping t-shirts in a container and grouping many containers  not just two on a ship . Let's focus on clothing, for example.  A brand of stores needs to replenish the stock of clothing in each store as the customers purchase their products. In this case, the corporation has 10,000 stores. The brand produces jeans, for example. Their average product is a faded jean. This product sells a slow 50 units a month per store. That adds up to 10,000 stores x 50 units = 500,000 units or stock keeping unit  SKU  per month. These units are sold in all sizes grouped into average, small, and large. The sizes sold per month are random.  The main factory for this product has about 2,500 employees producing those jeans at an output of about 25,000 jeans per day. The employees work in the following main fields: cutting, assembling, washing, laser, packaging, and warehouse. See  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:20 , Automated Planning and Scheduling, for Amazon's patented approach to apparel production.  The first difficulty arises with the purchase and use of fabric. The fabric for this brand is not cheap. Large amounts are necessary. Each pattern  the form of pieces of the pants to be assembled  needs to be cut by wasting as little fabric as possible.   Imagine you have an empty box you want to fill up to optimize the volume. If you only put soccer balls in it, there will be a lot of space. If you slip tennis balls in the empty spaces, space will decrease. If on top of that, you fill the remaining empty spaces with ping pong balls, you will have optimized the box.   Building optimized subsets can be applied to containers, warehouse flows and storage, truckload optimizing, and almost all human activities.  [ 80 ]   Become an Unconventional Innovator  Chapter 4  In the apparel business, if 1% to 10% of fabric is wasted while manufacturing jeans, the company will survive the competition. At over 10%, there is a real problem to solve. Losing 20% on all the fabric consumed to manufacture jeans can bring the company down and force it into bankruptcy.   The main rule is to combine larger pieces and smaller pieces to make optimized cutting patterns.   Optimization of space through larger and smaller objects can be applied to cutting the forms which are patterns of the jeans, for example. Once they are cut, they will be assembled at the sewing stations.  The problem can be summed up as:  Creating subsets of the 500,000 SKUs to optimize the cutting process for the month to come in a given factory Making sure that each subset contains smaller sizes and larger sizes to minimize loss of fabric by choosing six sizes per day to build 25,000 unit subsets per day Generating cut plans of an average of three to six sizes per subset per day for a production of 25,000 units per day  In mathematical terms, this means trying to find subsets of sizes among 500,000 units for a given day.  The task is to find six well-matched sizes among 500,000 units. This is calculated by the following combination formula:  At this point, most people abandon the idea and just find some easy way out of this even if it means wasting fabric. The problem was that in this project, I was paid on a percentage of the fabric I would manage to save. The contract stipulated that I must save 3% of all fabric consumption per month for the whole company to get paid a share of that. Or receive nothing at all. Believe me, once I solved that, I kept that contract as a trophy and a tribute to simplicity.  The first reaction we all have is that this is more than the number of stars in the universe and all that hype!  [ 81 ]   Become an Unconventional Innovator  Chapter 4  That's not the right way to look at it at all. The right way is to look exactly in the opposite direction. The key to this problem is to observe the particle at a microscopic level, at the bits of information level. This is a fundamental concept of machine learning and deep learning. Translated into our field, it means that to process an image, ML and DL process pixels. So, even if the pictures to analyze represent large quantities, it will come down to small units of information to analyze:  yottabyte  YB  1024 yobibyte  YiB  280  Today, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and others have yottabytes of data to classify and make sense of. Using the word big data doesn't mean much. It's just a lot of data, and so what?  You do not need to analyze individual positions of each data point in a dataset, but use the probability distribution.  To understand that, let's go to a store to buy some jeans for a family. One of the parents wants a pair of jeans, and so does a teenager in that family. They both go and try to find their size in the pair of jeans they want. The parent finds 10 pairs of jeans in size x. All of the jeans are part of the production plan. The parent picks one at random, and the teenager does the same. Then they pay for them and take them home.   Some systems work fine with random choices: random transportation  taking jeans from the store to home  of particles  jeans, other product units, pixels, or whatever is to be processed  making up that fluid  a dataset .   Translated into our factory, this means that a stochastic  random  process can be introduced to solve the problem.  All that was required is that small and large sizes were picked at random among the 500,000 units to produce. If six sizes from 1 to 6 were to be picked per day, the sizes could be classified as follows in a table:  Smaller sizes= S={1,2,3}   Larger sizes=L=[4,5,6}  [ 82 ]   Become an Unconventional Innovator  Chapter 4  Converting this into numerical subset names, S=1 and L=6. By selecting large and small sizes to produce at the same time, the fabric will be optimized:  Size of choice 1 Size of Choice 2 Output 6  1 1 6  0 0 1 1  6 1 6 1  Doesn't this sound familiar? It looks exactly like our vintage FNN, with 1 instead of 0 and 6 instead of 1. All that has to be done is to stipulate that subset S=value 0, and subset L=value 1; and the previous code can be generalized.  If this works, then smaller and larger sizes will be chosen to send to the cut planning department, and the fabric will be optimized. Applying the randomness concept of Bellman's equation, a stochastic process is applied, choosing customer unit orders at random  each order is one size and a unit quantity of 1 :   cid:88  cid:19  cid:31  cid:18  cid:16  cid:23  cid:29  cid:88  cid:20  cid:31  cid:19  cid:29  cid:67  cid:19  cid:31  cid:19   cid:88  cid:21  cid:31  cid:88  cid:20  cid:29  cid:88  cid:22  cid:31  cid:88  cid:19  cid:29  cid:67  cid:20  cid:31  cid:67  cid:19   cid:84  cid:19  cid:31  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:80  cid:78  cid:16  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:19  cid:14  cid:23  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18  cid:11  cid:5  cid:68  cid:73  cid:80  cid:74  cid:68  cid:70  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:80  cid:79  cid:70  cid:2  cid:84  cid:70  cid:85  cid:2  cid:84  cid:19   cid:84  cid:20  cid:31  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:80  cid:78  cid:16  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:19  cid:14  cid:23  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18  cid:11  cid:5  cid:68  cid:73  cid:80  cid:74  cid:68  cid:70  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:80  cid:79  cid:70  cid:2  cid:84  cid:70  cid:85  cid:2  cid:84  cid:20   The weights and bias are now constants obtained by the result of the XOR training FNN. The training is done; the FNN is simply used to provide results. Bear in mind that the word learning in machine learning and deep learning doesn't mean you have to train systems forever. In stable environments, training is run only when the datasets change. At one point in a project, you are hopefully using deep trained systems and are not just stuck in the deep learning process. The goal is not to spend all corporate resources on learning but on using trained models.  Deep learning architecture must rapidly become deep trained models to produce a profit or disappear from a corporate environment.

The choice is made of six sizes among 500,000 units. But, the request is to produce a daily production plan for the factory. The daily production target is 25,000. Also, each subset can be used about 20 times. There is always, on average, 20 times the same size in a given pair of jeans available.  Each subset result contains two orders, hence two units:  R=2 x 20 = 120  Each result produced by the system represents a quantity of 120 for 2 sizes.  Six sizes are required to obtain good fabric optimization. This means that after three choices, the result represents one subset of potential optimized choices:  R = 120 x 3 subsets of 2 sizes= 360  [ 84 ]   Become an Unconventional Innovator  Chapter 4  The magic number has been found. For every 3 choices, the goal of producing 6 sizes multiplied by a repetition of 20 will be reached.  The production per day request is 25,000:  The number of subsets requested = 25000 3=8333. 333   The system can run  cid:26  cid:21  cid:21  cid:21  products as long as necessary to produce the volume of subsets requested. In this case, the range is set to  cid:19  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18  products because only the positive results are accepted.

Not only was this project a success with a similar algorithm, but also the software ran for years in various forms on key production sites, reducing material consumption and generating a profit each time it ran. The software later mutated in a powerfully advanced planning and scheduling application.  Two main functions, among some minor ones, must be added:  After each choice, the orders chosen must be removed from the 500,000-order dataset. This will preclude choosing the same order twice and reduce the number of choices to be made.

Application information:  The core calculation part of the application is less than 50-lines long When a few control functions and dataset tensors are added, the program might reach 200 lines maximum This guarantees easy maintenance for a team  It takes a lot of time to break a problem down into elementary parts and find a simple, powerful solution. It thus takes much longer than just typing hundreds to thousands of lines of code to make things work. The simple solution, however, will always be more profitable and software maintenance will prove more cost effective.  Summary Building a small neural network from scratch provides a practical view of the elementary properties of a neuron. We saw that a neuron requires an input that can contain many variables. Then, weights are applied to the values with biases. An activation function then transforms the result and produces an output.  Neuronal networks, even one- or two-layer networks, can provide real-life solutions in a corporate environment. The real-life business case was implemented using complex theory broken down into small functions. Then, these components were assembled to be as minimal and profitable as possible.  Customers expect quick-win solutions. Artificial intelligence provides a large variety of tools that satisfy that goal. When solving a problem for a customer, do not look for the best theory, but the simplest and fastest way to implement a profitable solution no matter how unconventional it seems.  In this case, an enhanced perceptron solved a complex business problem. In the next chapter, an FNN will be introduced using TensorFlow.

As developers, we tend to rush to some sample code, run it, and then try to implement it somehow. That's like going to a big city we don't know, with no map and no guiding system, and trying to find a street. Even worse, it's like trying to build a 50-storey building with no architect or plans.  An efficient, well-thought architecture will lead to a good solution. Deep learning networks are data flow graph calculations as shown in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:22 , Become an Unconventional Innovator. A node or edge is, in fact, a mathematical operation. The lines connecting these nodes are data flows and mathematical representations. Tools such as TensorFlow and TensorBoard have been designed for data flow graph representations and calculations. Without using TensorBoard, the graph representation of a network, there is little to no chance of understanding and designing deep networks.  The sponsors of a project need to understand the concepts of a given solution. This chapter explores how to use these tools and, at the same time, make a successful presentation to a CEO, top managers, or your team.

A  TensorFlow architecture and solution to the XOR function is the place to start. The architecture of the example differs from the vintage, built-from-scratch solution but the concepts remain the same.  [ 89 ]   Manage the Power of Machine Learning and Deep Learning  Chapter 5  Writing code using the data flow graph as an architectural roadmap TensorFlow is a graph-driven solution based on graph theory, a branch of mathematics. Designing deep learning without graphs would prove quite difficult. My XOR FNN built from scratch in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:22 , Become an Unconventional Innovator, fits the need of the case study described. However, if thousands of nodes are required, TensorFlow, Keras  with TensorFlow backend , or other similar solutions will be needed. In this chapter, a neural network will be developed in TensorFlow.  The building blocks of graphs are nodes  or vertices, or points  and edges  or lines  that connect the nodes to one another.  In TensorFlow parlance, nodes are cleverly named ops for operations. In  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:22 , Become an Unconventional Innovator, the Python example shows exactly that: nodes as operations and calculations.  Mathematical models will be described through a data flow graph. The first step is to build the model, your architecture.  In a TensorFlow program, the first top source code lines are not just a new way to describe variables that you will use later. They are the program. They are critical to the computation of the graph. In fact, TensorFlow uses the graph to compute the operations. The graph is the architecture, the roadmap that describes the whole computation process of a deep learning neural network. The following graph has taken the code lines and transformed them into a graph. Imagine that the following graph is a network of water pipes in the city. First, the city builds the pipes. Only then does the water  data in our case  flow in those pipes. The pipes  TensorFlow variables, arrays, and other objects  are not a formality. They represent the core architecture of a system.  This graph is built with  cid:39  cid:47  cid:47  cid:64  cid:57  cid:48  cid:51  cid:64  cid:53  cid:70  cid:79  cid:84  cid:80  cid:83  cid:71  cid:77  cid:80  cid:88  cid:64  cid:72  cid:83  cid:66  cid:81  cid:73  cid:64  cid:80  cid:79  cid:77  cid:90  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  to show how to use TensorBoard to analyze your network. It will prove easier to fix design errors with TensorBoard. Click on the nodes to explore the details of each part of the graph. Run the program; then run  cid:53  cid:70  cid:79  cid:84  cid:80  cid:83  cid:35  cid:80  cid:66  cid:83  cid:69  cid:64  cid:83  cid:70  cid:66  cid:69  cid:70  cid:83  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  to launch TensorBoard.   [ 90 ]   Manage the Power of Machine Learning and Deep Learning  Chapter 5  The following diagram illustrates this:  A data flow graph translated into source code The data flow graph will be used to build the architecture of a project. It can be used as a project management tool and project optimization tool as shown in the last part of this chapter.   cid:53  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:81  cid:86  cid:85  cid:2  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:2  cid:77  cid:66  cid:90  cid:70  cid:83  The input data on the graph represents each pair of two inputs computed at a time in this XOR model using  cid:39  cid:47  cid:47  cid:64  cid:57  cid:48  cid:51  cid:64  cid:53  cid:70  cid:79  cid:84  cid:80  cid:83  cid:71  cid:77  cid:80  cid:88  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90 .  This program shows how to build a TensorFlow network in a few lines. In other models, millions of pixels or other values can constitute the input. In this case, XOR is trained with this model:   cid:57  cid:48  cid:51  cid:64  cid:57  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:60  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:62  cid:14  cid:60  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14  cid:60  cid:19  cid:14  cid:19  cid:62  cid:62    cid:35  cid:3  cid:70  cid:67  cid:86  cid:67  cid:97  cid:81  cid:89  cid:3  cid:73  cid:84  cid:67  cid:82  cid:74   [ 91 ]   Manage the Power of Machine Learning and Deep Learning  Chapter 5  The first two inputs are  0,0 , for example. The input will contain x1=0 and x2=0. Those inputs are sent to the hidden layer along with the weights and biases:   cid:56  cid:19  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:55  cid:66  cid:83  cid:74  cid:66  cid:67  cid:77  cid:70  cid:10  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:80  cid:78  cid:64  cid:86  cid:79  cid:74  cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:78  cid:10  cid:60  cid:20  cid:14  cid:20  cid:62  cid:14  cid:2  cid:15  cid:19  cid:14  cid:2  cid:19  cid:11  cid:14  cid:2  cid:79  cid:66  cid:78  cid:70  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:4  cid:56  cid:70  cid:74  cid:72  cid:73  cid:85  cid:84  cid:19  cid:4  cid:11   cid:35  cid:19  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:55  cid:66  cid:83  cid:74  cid:66  cid:67  cid:77  cid:70  cid:10  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:91  cid:70  cid:83  cid:80  cid:84  cid:10  cid:60  cid:20  cid:62  cid:11  cid:14  cid:2  cid:79  cid:66  cid:78  cid:70  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:4  cid:35  cid:74  cid:66  cid:84  cid:19  cid:4  cid:11    cid:53  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:73  cid:74  cid:69  cid:69  cid:70  cid:79  cid:2  cid:77  cid:66  cid:90  cid:70  cid:83  The hidden layer contains a multiplication function of weights and an addition of biases, as shown in the following diagram:   cid:35  cid:3  cid:70  cid:67  cid:86  cid:67  cid:97  cid:81  cid:89  cid:3  cid:73  cid:84  cid:67  cid:82  cid:74  cid:3  cid:89  cid:75  cid:86  cid:74  cid:3  cid:79  cid:87  cid:78  cid:86  cid:75  cid:82  cid:78  cid:75  cid:69  cid:67  cid:86  cid:75  cid:81  cid:80  cid:3  cid:72  cid:87  cid:80  cid:69  cid:86  cid:75  cid:81  cid:80   The input is sent to the multiplication function along with the weights. Thus x1 and x2 will be multiplied by the weights as explained in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:22 , Become an Unconventional Innovator. In this model, the bias variable is added to the result of the multiplications to each of the hidden neurons  one for each x . Go back to  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:22 , Become an Unconventional Innovator, again to see the low-level mechanics of the system if necessary.  Bear in mind that there are several mathematical ways, and thus there are several architectures represented in graphs that can solve the FNN XOR problem. Once the  multiplication and addition have been computed, a logistic sigmoid function  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83   cid:20 , Think like a Machine  is applied to the result.   [ 92 ]   Manage the Power of Machine Learning and Deep Learning  Chapter 5  Why is a logistic sigmoid function needed here?  In  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:22 , Become an Unconventional Innovator, in my vintage program, I did not use one. I just rounded the values to 0 or 1. That works in a limited environment. However, as explained in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:20 , Think like a Machine, the output of the neurons needs to be normalized to be useful when the input data starts increasing and diversifying. To sum it up, suppose we obtain 200 as an input of a neuron and 2 as an output of another neuron. That makes it very difficult to manage this in the next layer. It's as if you went to a shop and had to pay for one product in a given currency and another product in a different currency. Now the cashier has to add that up. It's not practical at all in a shop and even less in a network with thousands of neurons.  The following  cid:45  cid:52  logistic sigmoid is thus a very handy tool for the outputs to level the values:   cid:45  cid:52  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:84  cid:74  cid:72  cid:78  cid:80  cid:74  cid:69  cid:10  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:78  cid:66  cid:85  cid:78  cid:86  cid:77  cid:10  cid:89  cid:64  cid:14  cid:2  cid:56  cid:19  cid:11  cid:2  cid:13  cid:2  cid:35  cid:19  cid:11   Basically, the values are squashed into small numbers that are compatible with the next step, which is the computation of the output layer.   cid:53  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:80  cid:86  cid:85  cid:81  cid:86  cid:85  cid:2  cid:77  cid:66  cid:90  cid:70  cid:83  The output layer will now receive the result y =  input * weights+ bias  squashed by logistic sigmoid  y , as shown in the following diagram:   cid:35  cid:3  cid:70  cid:67  cid:86  cid:67  cid:97  cid:81  cid:89  cid:3  cid:73  cid:84  cid:67  cid:82  cid:74  cid:3  cid:89  cid:75  cid:86  cid:74  cid:3  cid:81  cid:87  cid:86  cid:82  cid:87  cid:86  cid:3  cid:78  cid:67  cid:91  cid:71  cid:84   [ 93 ]   Manage the Power of Machine Learning and Deep Learning  Chapter 5  The output layer takes the y output of the hidden layer  on the right-hand side of the graph  and receives the weights and bias to apply to this layer in this model. Once the multiplication of weights and addition of bias are computed, the logistic sigmoid function squashes this output as well. This is a very nice way of keeping values homogeneous over the network. It's a tidy way of always sending small computable values to the next layer as implemented in the following code.   cid:48  cid:86  cid:85  cid:81  cid:86  cid:85  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:84  cid:74  cid:72  cid:78  cid:80  cid:74  cid:69  cid:10  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:78  cid:66  cid:85  cid:78  cid:86  cid:77  cid:10  cid:45  cid:52  cid:14  cid:2  cid:56  cid:20  cid:11  cid:2  cid:13  cid:2  cid:35  cid:20  cid:11   Now that the output has been obtained, what is it worth? How is it evaluated and how are the weights adjusted?   cid:53  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:68  cid:80  cid:84  cid:85  cid:2  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:77  cid:80  cid:84  cid:84  cid:2  cid:71  cid:86  cid:79  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  The following cost function compares the expected result  cid:90  cid:64  with the present result produced by the network.   cid:68  cid:80  cid:84  cid:85  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:83  cid:70  cid:69  cid:86  cid:68  cid:70  cid:64  cid:78  cid:70  cid:66  cid:79  cid:10  cid:10  cid:2  cid:10  cid:90  cid:64  cid:2  cid:12  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:77  cid:80  cid:72  cid:10  cid:48  cid:86  cid:85  cid:81  cid:86  cid:85  cid:11  cid:11  cid:2  cid:13  cid:2  cid:10  cid:10  cid:19  cid:2  cid:15  cid:2  cid:90  cid:64  cid:11  cid:2  cid:12  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:77  cid:80  cid:72  cid:10  cid:19  cid:16  cid:18  cid:2  cid:15   cid:48  cid:86  cid:85  cid:81  cid:86  cid:85  cid:11  cid:11  cid:2  cid:11  cid:2  cid:12  cid:2  cid:15  cid:19  cid:11   The  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:77  cid:80  cid:72  is applied to the results to squash them for efficient comparisons.

Another way to calculate a cost function, as shown in the following code, is to compare the output of the current iteration with the target output and square both to obtain a visible difference.   cid:68  cid:80  cid:84  cid:85  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:83  cid:70  cid:69  cid:86  cid:68  cid:70  cid:64  cid:78  cid:70  cid:66  cid:79  cid:10  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:84  cid:82  cid:86  cid:66  cid:83  cid:70  cid:10  cid:90  cid:64  cid:15  cid:48  cid:86  cid:85  cid:81  cid:86  cid:85  cid:11  cid:11   Choosing a cost function will depend on your model. This method in its minimized format is called least squares. It produces efficient results in this model.   cid:40  cid:83  cid:66  cid:69  cid:74  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:2  cid:69  cid:70  cid:84  cid:68  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:2  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:2  cid:67  cid:66  cid:68  cid:76  cid:81  cid:83  cid:80  cid:81  cid:66  cid:72  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  Gradient descent defines two concepts:  Gradient or derivative measurement of the slope  up or down   how steep  Descent or reducing the error level between the present result, relying on the parameters  weights and biases , and the target training dataset  [ 94 ]   Manage the Power of Machine Learning and Deep Learning  Chapter 5  There are several ways to measure whether you are going up or down a slope. Derivatives are the most commonly used mathematical tool for this. Let us say you have 15 steps to go from one floor of a building down to the next floor. At each step, you feel you are going down.  The slope or derivative is the function describing you going down those stairs:  S = slope of you going down the stairs dy = where you are once you have made a step  up, down, or staying on a step  dx = the size of your steps  one at a time, two at a time, and so on  f x  = the fact of going downstairs, for example from step 4 to step 3, step by step. The derivative or slope is thus:  f x  is the function of you going down  or up or stopping on a step . For example, when you move one step forward, you are going from step 4 to step 3  down . Thus f x =x-b, in which b = 1 in this example. This is called a decreasing function. h = the number of steps you are going at each pace, for example, one step down if you are not in a hurry and two steps down if you are in a hurry. In this example, you are going down one step at a time from step 4 to 3; thus h = 1  one step at a time .  We obtain the following formula:  This means that we are at step 3 after taking one step. We started at step 4, so we went down -1 step. The minus sign means you are going downstairs from step 4 to step 3 or -1 step.  The gradient is the direction the function is taking. In this case, it is -1 step. If you go down two steps at a time, it would be -2. A straightforward way is just to take the derivative and use it. If it's 0, we're not moving. If it's negative we're going down  less computation or less remaining time to train .  If the slope is positive, we are in trouble, we're going up and increase the cost of the function  more training or more remaining time to train .   [ 95 ]   Manage the Power of Machine Learning and Deep Learning  Chapter 5  The goal of an FNN is to converge to 0. This means that as long as the parameters  weights and biases  are not optimized, the output is far from the target expected. In this case, for example, there are four predicates to train  1-1,0-0,1-0,0-1 . If only two results are correct, the present situation is negative, which is 2 - 4 = -2. When three results are correctly trained, the output gradient descent is 3 - 4 = -1. This will be translated into derivative gradient descent form using the cost calculated. Descent means that 0 is the target when all four outputs out of four are correct. This arithmetic works for an example without complicated calculations. But TensorFlow provides functions for all situations to calculate the cost  cost function , see whether the training session is going well  down , and optimize the weights to be sure that the cost is diminishing  gradient descent .

In this TensorFlow example, the means of the output values are calculated and then squashed with the logistic function. It will provide information for the inbuilt gradient descent optimizer to minimize the cost, with a small training step  0.01 . This means that the weights will be slightly changed before each iteration. An iteration defines backpropagation. By going back running the FNN again, then measuring, and going back again, we are propagating many combinations of weights cid:100 hopefully in the right direction  down the slope  cid:100 to optimize the network.  Stochastic gradient descent  SGD  consists of calculating gradient descent on samples of random  stochastic  data instead of using the whole dataset every time.   cid:51  cid:86  cid:79  cid:79  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:84  cid:70  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  The last step is to run the architecture that has just been designed.

Note that this source code only contains the architecture of the data flow graph and no program running the data. The program is the architecture that defines computations. The rest is defining the datasets cid:100 how they will be fed  totally or partially  to the graph. I recommend that you use TensorBoard to design the architecture of your solutions with the TensorFlow graph code. Only then, introduce the dynamics of feeding data and running a program.

It can be included in the main source code.  Once launched, you will see images of the previous section. You are now ready to enter corporate environments as a solid architect thinker and designer.  Use a TensorBoard reader such as this for your meetings. You will be viewed as an architect. You can use Microsoft PowerPoint or other tools naturally. But at one point, even a single view of this data flow graph, from a few seconds up to as long as your audience is interested, shows that you master the architecture of the solution. That is, you master the subject.

The summaries have been simplified, the cost function uses the optimized least squares method, and XOR linear separability has been proven with this model.  [ 100 ]   Manage the Power of Machine Learning and Deep Learning  Chapter 5  Using TensorBoard in a corporate environment Choosing the right architecture for your machine learning or deep learning solution is key to the technical success of your project.  Then, being able to explain it fewer than 2 minutes to a CEO, a top manager, or even a member of your team is key to the commercial success of your project.

[ 101 ]   Manage the Power of Machine Learning and Deep Learning  Chapter 5  Using TensorBoard to explain the concept of classifying customer products to a CEO Designing solutions seem fine, but if you can't sell them to your team or management, they won't go far. More often than not, we think that since we have a good technical background, we'll be recognized. Nothing is more deceiving. In a world where knowledge is everywhere, competition will be at your door everyday. Furthermore, managers will have less and less time to listen to what we have to say.  The architecture of your solution depends on what your buyers  team managers, prospects, or customers  ask you. Your freedom to implement your views depends on how well you present your architecture in a way that fits their needs.  It's 8:30. The CEO has dropped into your office and is touring the company. The CEO is sharp, bright, and has no patience with people who can't express themselves clearly. You lower your head and look in the garbage can to find something that's not there. It doesn't work. The CEO comes straight to you, invites you to a meeting room and asks you to present what you are doing. A few other managers come in to see what's going on and whether you will survive the presentation.  Will your views on the project survive this meeting? You can take your corporate PowerPoint out and bore your audience, or you can captivate it.  I have gone through these meetings hundreds of times with a 90% sales success rate and have refined a method that can be summed up in my 2-minute pitch, which always goes something like the following.  [ 102 ]   Manage the Power of Machine Learning and Deep Learning  Chapter 5  I will display a chart and the following graph and say:  "Let's go straight to the point. We're trying to analyze the details of products based on their images and find the most profitable ones. Here is a one-page chart showing the list of the most promising products. Here is TensorBoard; it comes with TensorFlow package. The computation power of TensorFlow's data flow guarantees disruptive innovative profits for this project.

What we expect is the profitable classification of products: the best ones that represent our brand AND the ones that also generate the most profit. So basically, there are two main types of features to extract: forms, shapes, and colors of the most trendy products; and profit. To achieve that, we feed  that's literally the language we use in code  the system with the results we expect, a dataset of good choices  point to the  cid:74  cid:79  cid:81  cid:86  cid:85  cid:64  cid:70  cid:89  cid:81  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:64  cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:74  cid:68  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  box .

By analyzing the features of the products, they will have more precise marketing data to drive their sales."  If you read this aloud slowly, it should take you be under 2 minutes, which is your first- level survival time.  The rules I've applied successfully are as follows:   Explain from off the top  global concepts . Use as few words as possible, but choose the right ones. Don't avoid technical concepts, but break them down into small key parts. This means that, once again, TensorBoard architecture will develop this ability. Speak slowly. Speaking slowly, stopping at each sentence, emphasizing each keyword, and pointing to the graph at the same time is the only way to make sure you are not losing anybody. After 2 minutes, sum your introduction up and ask: "Am I clear? Do you want me to continue. Questions?" If they want you to continue, then you can drill down, stopping at every key point to make sure that everybody is still with you.  Bear in mind that many CEOs are business visionaries. They see things we don't. So, if they come up with an idea, be very constructive and innovative.  Was the sales pitch convincing?  At this point, if you have a good project, the CEO will most probably say one of the following:   "Gee, that was clear and I understand what you are doing. Thanks. Bye." That's not too bad.   [ 104 ]   Manage the Power of Machine Learning and Deep Learning  Chapter 5  "That looks too simple to be true. Can you give some more details?" This could be an opportunity. The CEO wants me to explain more. So I drill down another 2 minutes around the way the weights are optimized in a clear way just like the first 2 minutes. At that point, in 20% of my meetings, I ended up having lunch or dinner with the CEO, who always has 100 other ideas for uses of such a program. Bear in mind that many CEOs are business visionaries. They see things we don't. So, if a new idea comes up, I generally say, "Great. I'll look into this and get back to you tomorrow." Then I spend the night coming up with something that works and is explained clearly. "Good. I'd like you to talk to X and see where this is going." Not bad either. Hopefully, X will listen to the CEO.  Statistically, being short and concise with real technical tangible objects to show worked 90% of the time for me. The 10% failures are lessons to learn from to keep the statistic up the next time around.  The percentage of failure of our presentations is our cost function. We have to bring that number down by learning from these failures by backpropagation as well. We need to go back and change our parameters to adapt to the next run.  Summary Mastering the architecture of a machine learning and deep learning solution means first, and above all, becoming an expert in designing the architecture of a solution and being able to explain it.  The early lines of a source code program are not just variable declaration lines; they represent the data flow graph that drives the computation of a neural network. These lines define the architecture of your solutions. They are critical to the future of an artificial intelligence solution.   The architecture of the solution, represented by TensorBoard, for example, serves two purposes. The first purpose defines the way the computation of the graph will behave. The second purpose is to use the architecture as a communication tool to sell your project to your team, management, prospects, and customers. Our environment defines our project and not simply our technical abilities, no matter how much we know.   The next chapter focuses on analyzing the core problems of machine learning and deep learning programs.

There is no such thing as a simple or easy way to design AI systems. A system is either efficient or not, beyond being either easy or not. Either the designed AI solution provides real-life practical uses or it builds up into a program that fails to work in various environments beyond the scope of training sets.  This chapter doesn't deal with how to build the most difficult system possible to show our knowledge and experience. It faces the hard truth of real-life delivery and ways to overcome obstacles.

How many features need to be implemented? What about optimizing the cost function and training functions?   Don't Get Lost in Techniques – Focus on Optimizing Your Solutions  Chapter 6  This chapter provides the methodology and tools needed to overcome everyday artificial intelligence project obstacles. k-means clustering, a key ML algorithm, will be applied to the increasing need for warehouse intelligence  Amazon and all online product-selling sites . Quickly showing the solution to a problem will keep a project alive. Focusing on the solution, and not the techniques, will get you there.

Providing an answer to that will take some hard work. The AI expert never really thought of that, having acquired expertise using the available, optimized, and downloadable training datasets to test the programs. The expert's name is Pert Ex  an anagram of expert  in this chapter. The expert likes to be called Pert.  The CEO of the corporation  or boss or customer  wants Pert to lead an Amazonization project. Pert doesn't quite understand what that means. The CEO has the patience to explain that wholesale e-commerce has overtaken traditional ways of doing business. Wholesale means increasing use of warehouses. How those warehouses are managed will make a difference to the cost of each project and the sales price.  Although the business is now huge and the warehouse is expanding, the costs of retrieving products from the warehouse locations have been increasing. The corporation, which we will name AGV-AI in this chapter, represents the sum of several real-life projects I have managed on various warehouse and aerospace sites. Bear in mind that moving large components in an aerospace project requires precise scheduling. Moving large volumes of small products in an Amazonization process or small volumes of oversized products  25 meters or 82 feet for example  such as aerospace components can be costly if badly planned. In AGV-AI, automatic guided vehicles  AGVs  are surprisingly taking longer routes from a warehouse location to a pier. AGV-AI manufactures, stores, and delivers large volumes of consumer goods.  The CEO wants Pert's team to find out what is going on and Pert must lead the technical aspects of the project.  Designing a dataset and choosing an ML DL model Pert goes back to his desk in an open space occupied by a team of 50 people and tries to represent what is wrong in the Amazonization process at the warehouse level.  On paper, it comes down to moving from warehouse locations to piers represented by a distance. The sum of the distances D could be a way to measure the process:  [ 109 ]   Don't Get Lost in Techniques – Focus on Optimizing Your Solutions  Chapter 6  f p  represents the action of going from a warehouse location to a pier and the distance it represents. Exactly like the distance, it takes you from a location in a shop where you picked  p  something up and the door of the shop on your way out. You can imagine that if you go straight from that location, pay, and go out, then that is a shorter way. But if you pick the product up, wander around the shop first, and then go out, the distance  and time  is longer. The sum of all of the distances of all the people wandering in this shop is D.  Pert now has a clear representation of the concept of the problem to solve: find the wanderers. How can an AGV wander? It's automatic. After spending a few days watching the AGVs in the warehouse, Pert understands why the AGVs are taking longer routes sometimes.  When an AGV encounters an obstacle either it stops or, in this case, it takes another route. Just like us in a shop when we have to walk around an obstacle to get where we want.  Pert smiles. Pert has a plan.  Approval of the design matrix Pert's plan is to first obtain as much data as possible and then choose an ML DL model. His plan is to represent all locations the AGVs come from on their way to the piers on a given day. It's a location-to-pier analysis. Since the AGVs were at that location at one point and their distances are recorded in their system, Pert goes over to the IT manager with a design matrix. A design matrix contains a different example on each row, and each column is a feature. Pert wants to play safe and comes up with the following format:  AGV number Start from location: Timestamp:yyyy,mm,dd,hh,mm End at pier: Timestamp:yyyy,mm,dd,hh,mm Location Pier number Distance  year-month-day-hour-minute  year-month-day-hour-minute  80  Ex1 1 Ex2 2 Ex3 3 Ex4 4 Ex5 5   cid:34  cid:72  cid:83  cid:70  cid:70  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:78  cid:66  cid:85  cid:2  cid:80  cid:71  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:69  cid:70  cid:84  cid:74  cid:72  cid:79  cid:2  cid:78  cid:66  cid:85  cid:83  cid:74  cid:89  The IT manager has been around AGV-AI for over 10 years and knows where all the existing data is stored. Pert explains that the design matrix is one of the best ways to start training a ML program. In this case:  AGV number identifies the vehicle. Start indicates when the AGV left a location  Location column .  [ 110 ]   Don't Get Lost in Techniques – Focus on Optimizing Your Solutions  Chapter 6  End indicates when the AGV reached a pier  Pier column . Distance is expressed in the metric system. Pert explains that most space agencies around the world use the metric system.  The IT manager starts off by saying the following:  The AGV number is not stored in the mainframe but the local system that manages the AGVs In the mainframe, there is a start time when an AGV picks up its load at the location and an end time when it reaches the pier The location can be obtained in the mainframe as well as the pier No distance is recorded  Pert would like to have access to the data in the AGV's local system to retrieve the AGV number and correlate it with the data in the mainframe.  The IT manager looks at Pert and decides to tell the artificial intelligence expert the simple truth:  1.  2.  3.  Retrieving data from the AGV guiding system is not possible this fiscal year. Those vehicles are expensive and no additional budget can be allocated. Nobody knows the distance it takes from a location to a pier. As long as the AGVs deliver the proper products on time at the right piers, nobody so far has been interested in distances. The AGV mission codes in the mainframe are not the same as in the local AGV guiding system, so they cannot be merged into a dataset without development.  The project is slipping away. AGV-AI doesn't have the leisure or budget to invest man days in extracting data that may or may not be used to optimize warehouse distances in its Amazonization process. Pert has to find a solution very quickly before the very busy IT manager drops the whole idea. Pert decides to think of this overnight and come back quickly the next day.  Keeping an AI project alive means moving quickly.  [ 111 ]   Don't Get Lost in Techniques – Focus on Optimizing Your Solutions  Chapter 6   cid:37  cid:74  cid:78  cid:70  cid:79  cid:84  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:66  cid:77  cid:74  cid:85  cid:90  cid:2  cid:83  cid:70  cid:69  cid:86  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  Pert is in trouble, and he knows it. Not all the data Pert would have liked can be obtained for the moment. Some features must be left aside for the moment. He thinks back to his walk from the IT manager's office to his office and looks at his cup of coffee.  Dimensionality reduction comes up!  DL uses dimensionality reduction to reduce the number of features in, for example, an image. Each pixel of a 3D image, for example, is linked to a neuron, which in turn brings the representation down to a 2D view with some form of function. For example, converting a color image into shades of a now-gray image can do the trick. Once that is done, simply reducing the values to, for example, 1  light  or 0  dark  makes it even easier for the network. Using an image converted to 0 and 1 pixels makes some classification processes more efficient, just like when we avoid a car on the road. We just see the object and avoid it. We are not contemplating the nice color or the car to avoid or other dimensions.  We perform dimensionality reduction all day long. When you walk from one office to another on the same floor of a building requiring no stairs or an elevator, you are not thinking that the earth is round and that you're walking over a slight curve. You have performed a dimensionality reduction. You are also performing a manifold operation. Basically, it means that locally, on that floor, you do not need to worry about the global roundness of the earth. Your manifold view of earth in your dimensionality reduction representation is enough to get you from your office to another one on that floor.   When you pick up your cup of coffee, you just focus on not missing it and aiming for the edges of it. You don't think about every single feature of that cup, such as its size, color, decoration, diameter, and the exact volume of coffee in it. You just identify the edge of the cup and pick it up. That is dimensionality reduction. Without dimensionality reduction, nothing can be accomplished. It would take you 10 minutes to analyze the cup of coffee and pick it up in that case!  When you pick that cup of coffee up, you test to see whether it is too hot, too cold, too warm, or just fine. You don't put a thermometer in the cup to obtain the precise temperature. You have again performed a dimensionality reduction of the features of that cup of coffee. Furthermore, when you picked it up, you computed a manifold representation by just observing the little distance around the cup, reducing the dimension of information around you. You are not worrying about the shape of the table, whether it was dirty on the other side, and other features.   Pert begins to imagine a  CNN  with dimensionality reduction. But the data will be insufficient for a CNN  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:27 , Getting Your Neurons to Work .   [ 112 ]   Don't Get Lost in Techniques – Focus on Optimizing Your Solutions  Chapter 6  There is no time to build a complicated DL program to compute dimensionality reduction and satisfy this need. Automatic dimensionality reduction will be dealt with later when the project has been accepted.  ML and DL techniques such as dimensionality reduction can be viewed as tools and be used in any field in which you find them useful. Reducing the number of features or modifying them can be done on a spreadsheet by selecting the useful columns and or modifying the data. By focusing on the solution, you can use any tool in any way you want as long as it works in a reliable way.  Pert then turns to a k-means clustering ML algorithm and decides to perform dimensionality reduction by analysis of the data and defining it for a computation. Each location will form a cluster as explained in the next section. With this intuition, Pert goes back and presents the following format:  Location Start from location:  Timestamp:yyyy,mm,dd,hh,mm  End at location: Timestamp:yyyy,mm,dd,hh,mm  Ex1  The IT manager is puzzled. Pert explains that as long as each location represents a separate AGV task from start time to the end time and the pier, the rest will be calculated.  The IT manager says that it can be extracted in  cid:16  cid:68  cid:84  cid:87  format within a couple of days for a test but asks how that makes the project possible. Pert says, "Provide the data, and I'll be back with a prototype within a couple of days as well."   cid:53  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:87  cid:80  cid:77  cid:86  cid:78  cid:70  cid:2  cid:80  cid:71  cid:2  cid:66  cid:2  cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:74  cid:79  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:84  cid:70  cid:85  Pert decides to keep the dataset down to six locations over two days. Six locations are chosen in the main warehouse with a group of truck loading points. Taking around 5,000 examples into account, that should represent the work of all the 25 AGVs purchased by AGI-AI running 24 hours a day. The IT manager delivers the  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:16  cid:68  cid:84  cid:87  file the next day.  Implementing a k-means clustering solution Pert now has a real  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:16  cid:68  cid:84  cid:87  dataset. The dataset needs to be converted into a prototype to prove the financial value of the project he has in mind. The amount of the money saved must capture the imagination of the CEO. Making a machine learning program work in a corporate environment means nothing without profit to justify its existence.  [ 113 ]   Don't Get Lost in Techniques – Focus on Optimizing Your Solutions  Chapter 6  Do not speak about a project in a corporate environment without knowing how much profit it represents and the cost of getting the job done.  The vision  Pert's primary goal can be summed up in one sentence: finding profit by optimizing AGVs. Achieving that goal will lead to obtaining a budget for a full-scale project.  The data provided does not contain distances. However, an estimation can be made per location as follows:  distance= end time- start time  average speed of an AGV  The start location is usually a loading point near a pier in this particular warehouse configuration.  The data The data provided contains start times  st , end times  endt , and delivery locations. To calculate distances, Pert needs to convert those times into a distance  di  with the following estimation for each location  ll :  di ll = endt-st  v  v = velocity of the AGV per minute endt-st is expressed in minutes di = estimated distance an AGV has gone in a given time  A Python program reads the initial file format and data and outputs a new file and format as follows:  Distance Location 55 18  53 17  [ 114 ]   Don't Get Lost in Techniques – Focus on Optimizing Your Solutions  Chapter 6   cid:36  cid:80  cid:79  cid:69  cid:74  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:78  cid:66  cid:79  cid:66  cid:72  cid:70  cid:78  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  The data file is available at  cid:73  cid:85  cid:85  cid:81  cid:84  cid:28  cid:17  cid:17  cid:72  cid:74  cid:85  cid:73  cid:86  cid:67  cid:16  cid:68  cid:80  cid:78  cid:17  cid:49  cid:66  cid:68  cid:76  cid:85  cid:49  cid:86  cid:67  cid:77  cid:74  cid:84  cid:73  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:17  cid:34  cid:83  cid:85  cid:74  cid:71  cid:74  cid:68  cid:74  cid:66  cid:77  cid:15   cid:42  cid:79  cid:85  cid:70  cid:77  cid:77  cid:74  cid:72  cid:70  cid:79  cid:68  cid:70  cid:15  cid:35  cid:90  cid:15  cid:38  cid:89  cid:66  cid:78  cid:81  cid:77  cid:70  cid:17  cid:67  cid:77  cid:80  cid:67  cid:17  cid:78  cid:66  cid:84  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:17  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:18  cid:24  cid:17  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:16  cid:68  cid:84  cid:87 .  Data conditioning means preparing the data that will become the input of the system. Poor conditioning can have two outcomes:  Bad data making no difference  large volumes and minor errors  Bad data making a difference  regardless of volumes, the data influences the outcome   In this particular case, out of the 5,000 records provided for the dataset, 25 distances are missing.  Pert has analyzed the warehouse and is lucky!   The location numbers start at 1. 1 is near the loading point of the products. The AGV has to bring the products to this point. To be more precise, in this warehouse configuration, the AGV goes and gets a box  or crate  of products and brings them back to location 1. At location 1, humans check the products and package them. After that, humans carefully load the products in the delivery trucks.  Having spent hours measuring distances in the warehouse, Pert knows that the distance from one location to the next is about 1 meter. For example, from location 1 to location 5, the distance is about 5 meters, or 5 m. Also since all locations lead to location 1 for the AGVs in this model, the theoretical distances will be calculated from location 1. Pert decides to generalize the rule and defines a distance di for a location lj as follows:  di is expressed in meters. Since the locations start at number 1 through n, the location number is equal to the approximate distance from the first location from which the AGVs depart. Looking at the data, it quickly appears that many distances are superior to their location numbers. That is strange because the distance should be about equal to the location.  The time has come to build a strategy and program.  di lj =lj  [ 115 ]   Don't Get Lost in Techniques – Focus on Optimizing Your Solutions  Chapter 6  The strategy Pert's strategy can be summed up as follows:  Quickly write a program to represent the AGV's trajectories in a visual way Go to the warehouse to check the results Calculate the potential optimized profit with a solution that is yet to be found Go back to present this to the top management to get a project budget approval  The k-means clustering program k-means clustering is a powerful unsupervised learning algorithm. We often perform k- means clustering in our lives. Take, for example, a lunch you want to organize for a team of about 50 people in an open space that can just fit those people. It will be a bit cramped but a project must be finished that day and it is a good way to bind the team for the final sprint.  A friend and a friend first decide to set up a table in the middle. Your friend points out that the people in that room will form a big cluster k, and with only one table in the geometric center  or centroid  c, it will not be practical. The people near the wall will not have access to the main table.  You have an idea. You call Pert, who runs a computation to confirm your friend's intuition. Pert shows them the problem with the following one-table plan:  The people not close to the table  rectangle in the middle  will not have easy access to the table.  [ 116 ]   Don't Get Lost in Techniques – Focus on Optimizing Your Solutions  Chapter 6  You go to the room with your friend and Pert and try moving two tables c1 and c2 in various places for two clusters of people k1 and k2.  The people x1 to xn form a dataset X. Your friend still has doubts and says, "Look at table c1. It is badly positioned. Some people x near the wall will be right next to it and the others too far away. We need the table c1 to be in the center of that cluster k1. The same goes for table c2."  You and your friend move a table c, and then estimate that the mean distance of the people x around it will be about the same in their group or cluster k. They do the same for the other table. They draw a line with chalk on the floor to make sure that each group or cluster is at about the mean distance from its table.  Pert speaks up and says, "Gee, we can simulate that with this Python program I am writing for my project!":  Step 1: You have been drawing lines with chalk to decide which group  cluster k  each person x will be in, by looking at the mean distance from the table c Step 2: You have been moving the tables around accordingly to optimize step 1  Pert shows them the two-table model computed by the k-means clustering program; it looks exactly like what you just did. Then they finally add a third table and it looks good. Pert says, "Look at what you did on the following screenshot.":  You and your friend look at Pert and say, "So what?"  [ 117 ]   Don't Get Lost in Techniques – Focus on Optimizing Your Solutions  Chapter 6  Pert smiles and says, "Well, you just re-invented Lloyd's algorithm to solve a k-means clustering problem!"  You and your friend are curious. You want to know more. So you each get a paperboard, and ask Pert to explain to you the warehouse project or any project with this model in mathematical terms.  The mathematical definition of k-means clustering The dataset X provides N points. These points or data points are formed by using distance as the x axis in a Cartesian representation and the location as the y axis in a Cartesian representation. If you have 1 person in on location 1 as the first record of your file, it will be represented as  x axis = 1 and y axis = 1 by the black dot, which is the data point, as shown in the following diagram:  In this example, 5,000 records are loaded from  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:16  cid:68  cid:84  cid:87 , which is in the same directory as the program. The data is unlabeled with no linear separation. The goal is to allocate the X data points to K clusters. The number of clusters is an input value. Each cluster will have its geometric center or centroid. If you decide to have three clusters K, then the result will be as follows:  Three clusters K in three colors in a visual representation  Three geometric centers or centroids representing the center of the mean of the sum of distances of x data points of that cluster  If you decide on six clusters, then you will obtain six centroids, and so on.  Described in mathematical terms, the formula in respect of Kk,  cid:97 k is as follows:  [ 118 ]   Don't Get Lost in Techniques – Focus on Optimizing Your Solutions  Chapter 6  This means that the sum of each k  cluster  from 1 to the number of clusters K of the sum of all distances of members xi to xn of each cluster K from their position to the geometric center  centroid   cid:97  must be minimized.   The smaller the distance from each member x to centroid  cid:97 , the more the system is optimized. Note that the distance is squared each time because this is a Euclidean distance in this version of the equation.   cid:45  cid:77  cid:80  cid:90  cid:69  cid:9  cid:84  cid:2  cid:66  cid:77  cid:72  cid:80  cid:83  cid:74  cid:85  cid:73  cid:78  cid:2  There are several variations of Lloyd's algorithm. But all of them follow a common philosophy.   For a given xn  data point , the distance from the centroid  cid:97  in its cluster must be less than going to another center. Exactly like how a person in the lunch example wants to be closer to one table rather than having to go far to get a sandwich because of the crowd!  The best centroid  cid:97  for a given xn is as follows:  This calculation is done for all  cid:97   centroids  in all the clusters from k1 to K.  Once each xi has been allocated to a Kk, the algorithm recomputes  cid:97  by calculating the means of all the points that belong to each cluster and readjusts the centroid  cid:97 k.  The goal of k-means clustering in this case study The goal must be clear, not simple, not easy, for Pert's managers to understand. Pert decides to write a Python program first. Then if things go well, a full-scale project will be designed. The goal must be to find the gain zone. The gain zone will be the data points that could have been optimized in terms of distances.  In projects you build, distances can be replaced by costs, hours, or any optimization measurement feature. Location can be replaced by a feature such as the number of people, phone calls, or any other measurement.  k-means clustering can be applied to a range of applications as explained in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83   cid:25 , When to Use Artificial Intelligence.  [ 119 ]   Don't Get Lost in Techniques – Focus on Optimizing Your Solutions  Chapter 6  The Python program The Python program uses the  cid:84  cid:76  cid:77  cid:70  cid:66  cid:83  cid:79  library  which contains efficient algorithms ,  cid:81  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:66  cid:84  for data analysis  only used to import the data in this program , and  cid:46  cid:66  cid:85  cid:81  cid:77  cid:80  cid:85  cid:77  cid:74  cid:67  to plot the results as data points  the coordinates of the data  and clusters  data points classified in each cluster with a color .

It takes only a few locations into account. I would say that we could save 10% of the distances of our 25 AGVs on this site only. If we add nine other major sites in the world that adds up to:  10% of  25 AGVs * 10 sites  = a gain of 25 AGVs  [ 124 ]   Don't Get Lost in Techniques – Focus on Optimizing Your Solutions  Chapter 6  That's because the AGVs are not going directly to the right locations but are wandering around unplanned obstacles.  Pert has everybody's attention!  In real life, I started my career with major corporations by making the following statement in similar cases  factories, warehouses, purchasing department, scheduling departments, and many other fields :  Pay me a percentage of that gain, and I will do the project for free until that is proven.  If the solution is mathematically solid and the data available, there is a risk to calculate to enter a corporation. When that is achieved once, it is easier the times after.  In this case, Pert's audience asks how this was estimated. The explanation is not simple but clear. The average distance from one location to another is 1 meter. The AGVs all start out from location 0 or 1. So the distance is strictly proportional to the locations in this particular example  which is not always the case .   To find the gain zone of a location, you draw a red horizontal line from location 80, for example, and a vertical line from distance 80  add a couple of meters to take small variances into account .  None of the data points on the 80 location line should be beyond the maximum limit. The limit is 80 meters + a small variance of a few meters. Beyond that line, on the right-hand side of the figure, is where the company is losing money and something must be done to optimize the distances. This loss zone is the gain zone for a project. The gain zone on the k- means cluster results shows that some of the locations of 40 to 60 exceed 80 meters distance.  Something is wrong, and a project can fix it.  AGV virtual clusters as a solution The planners anticipate AGVs tasks. They send them to probable locations from which they will have to pick up products and bring them back to the truck-loading points.  [ 125 ]   Don't Get Lost in Techniques – Focus on Optimizing Your Solutions  Chapter 6  One of the solutions is to provide AGV virtual clusters as a business rule, as shown in the following screenshot:  Rule 1: The line in the middle represents a new business rule. In phase 1 of the project, an AGV used for locations 40 to 60 cannot go beyond that 60 meter + small variance line. Rule 2: A cluster will represent the pick-up zone for an AGV. The centroid will now be its parking zone. Distances will be optimized until all the clusters respect rule 1.  The financial manager and CEO approve Pert's prototype. But there now two conditions for this to become a project:  Present an architecture for large volumes for 10 sites, not just this site. Present the same model but with different features to optimize the e-commerce of the corporation's websites that now represent 90% of all sales. Using the solution for another project will generate more profit with this approach.   [ 126 ]   Don't Get Lost in Techniques – Focus on Optimizing Your Solutions  Chapter 6  Summary Up to this point, we have explored Python with  cid:47  cid:86  cid:78  cid:49  cid:90 ,  cid:53  cid:70  cid:79  cid:84  cid:80  cid:83  cid:39  cid:77  cid:80  cid:88 ,  cid:84  cid:76  cid:77  cid:70  cid:66  cid:83  cid:79 ,  cid:81  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:66  cid:84 , and  cid:78  cid:66  cid:85  cid:81  cid:77  cid:80  cid:85  cid:77  cid:74  cid:67  libraries. More platforms and libraries will be implemented in this book. In the months and years to come, even more languages, libraries, frameworks, and platforms will appear on the market. However, artificial intelligence is not only about development techniques. It is a branch of applied mathematics that requires a real-life interest in the field to deliver. Building a k-means clustering program from scratch requires careful planning. The program relies on data that is rarely available as we expect it. That's where our imagination comes in handy to find the right features for our datasets.  Once the dataset has been defined, poor conditioning can compromise the project. Some small changes in the data will lead to incorrect results.   Preparing the training dataset from scratch takes much more time that we would initially expect. Artificial intelligence was designed to make life easier but that's after a project has been successfully implemented. The problem is that building a solution requires major dataset work and constant surveillance.  Then comes the hard work of programming a k-means clustering solution that must be explained to a team. Lloyd's algorithm comes in very handy to that effect by reducing development time.  k-means clustering can be applied to many fields and architectures as will be explained in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:25 , When to Use Artificial Intelligence.

Managers evaluate the feasibility of a project and return on investment before giving a green signal to an AI implementation.

The time has come to carefully deploy a large number of datasets by first showing that a classical approach will not work. Then we use the proper architecture to get the project on track.   Amazon Web Services AWS  SageMaker and Amazon S3 provide an innovative way to train machine learning datasets. The goal here is not to suggest that AWS could be the best solution but to show the best of AWS. AWS will constantly evolve, just like Google, IBM, Microsoft, and other platforms.  However, even though machine learning platforms might differ, the implementation method will necessarily remain the same.  The following topics will be covered in this chapter:  Proving that AI must or not be used Data volume issues Proving the NP-hard characteristic of k-means clustering  The central limit theorem  CLT  Random sampling Monte Carlo sampling Stochastic sampling   When and How to Use Artificial Intelligence  Chapter 7  Shuffling a training dataset How to use AWS SageMaker for a machine learning training model  Technical requirements You will need Python 3.6x 64-bit from  cid:73  cid:85  cid:85  cid:81  cid:84  cid:28  cid:17  cid:17  cid:88  cid:88  cid:88  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  cid:85  cid:73  cid:80  cid:79  cid:16  cid:80  cid:83  cid:72  cid:17 :   cid:71  cid:83  cid:80  cid:78  cid:2  cid:84  cid:76  cid:77  cid:70  cid:66  cid:83  cid:79  cid:16  cid:68  cid:77  cid:86  cid:84  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:74  cid:78  cid:81  cid:80  cid:83  cid:85  cid:2  cid:44  cid:46  cid:70  cid:66  cid:79  cid:84   cid:74  cid:78  cid:81  cid:80  cid:83  cid:85  cid:2  cid:81  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:66  cid:84  cid:2  cid:66  cid:84  cid:2  cid:81  cid:69   cid:71  cid:83  cid:80  cid:78  cid:2  cid:78  cid:66  cid:85  cid:81  cid:77  cid:80  cid:85  cid:77  cid:74  cid:67  cid:2  cid:74  cid:78  cid:81  cid:80  cid:83  cid:85  cid:2  cid:81  cid:90  cid:81  cid:77  cid:80  cid:85  cid:2  cid:66  cid:84  cid:2  cid:81  cid:77  cid:85   cid:71  cid:83  cid:80  cid:78  cid:2  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:80  cid:78  cid:2  cid:74  cid:78  cid:81  cid:80  cid:83  cid:85  cid:2  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85   cid:74  cid:78  cid:81  cid:80  cid:83  cid:85  cid:2  cid:79  cid:86  cid:78  cid:81  cid:90  cid:2  cid:66  cid:84  cid:2  cid:79  cid:81   You will need programs from GitHub  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:18  cid:25 :   cid:76  cid:15  cid:78  cid:70  cid:66  cid:79  cid:84  cid:64  cid:68  cid:77  cid:86  cid:84  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:64  cid:78  cid:74  cid:79  cid:74  cid:67  cid:66  cid:85  cid:68  cid:73  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90    cid:76  cid:15  cid:78  cid:70  cid:66  cid:79  cid:84  cid:64  cid:68  cid:77  cid:86  cid:84  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:64  cid:78  cid:74  cid:79  cid:74  cid:67  cid:66  cid:85  cid:68  cid:73  cid:64  cid:84  cid:73  cid:86  cid:71  cid:71  cid:77  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90   Check out the following video to see the code in action:   cid:73  cid:85  cid:85  cid:81  cid:84  cid:28  cid:17  cid:17  cid:72  cid:80  cid:80  cid:16  cid:72  cid:77  cid:17  cid:19  cid:79  cid:51  cid:49  cid:41  cid:24   Checking whether AI can be avoided Trying to avoid AI in a book on AI may seem paradoxical. However, AI tools can be compared to having a real toolkit in real life. If you are at home and you just need to change a light bulb, you do not have to get your brand new toolkit to show off to everybody around you. You just change the light bulb and that's it.  In AI, as in real life, use the right tools at the right time. If AI is not necessary to solve a problem, do not use it.  Use a proof of concept  POC  approach to prove your point for an AI project. A POC should cost much less than the project itself and helps to build a team that believes in the outcome. The first step is exploring the data volume and the method that will be used.  [ 130 ]   When and How to Use Artificial Intelligence  Chapter 7  Data volume and applying k-means clustering Anybody who has run MNIST with 60,000 handwritten image examples on a laptop knows that it takes some time for a machine learning program to train and test these examples. Whether a machine learning program or a deep learning convolutional network is applied, it uses a lot of the local machine's resources. Even if you run it on training on GPUs  short for graphics processing unit  hoping to get better performance than with CPUs, it still takes a lot of time for the training process to run through all the learning epochs.  If you go on and you want to train your program on images, CIFAR-10, a-60,000 image subset of the tiny image dataset, will consume even more resources on your local machine.  Suppose now, in this case, Pert Ex has to start using k-means clustering in a corporation with hundreds of millions of records of data to analyze in a SQL Server or Oracle database. Pert calls you in to manage the POC phase of the project. For example, you find that you have to work for the phone operating activity of the corporation and apply a k-means clustering program to the duration of phone calls to locations around the world every morning for several weeks. That represents about several million records per day, adding up to 3 billion records in a month. Once that has been implemented, the top marketing manager wants to use the visual result of the clusters and centroids for an investment meeting at the end of the month.  You go to the IT department and ask for a server to do the k-means clustering training and simulation process. You get a flat number. Everybody knows that a machine learning k- means clustering training program running over 3 billion records will consume too much CPU GPU. A shrewd colleague points out that 3 billion records represent only one feature. If you talk about location and duration, that represents two features, bringing the data volume to 6 billion cells in a matrix.  You clearly understand the point and agree that there is a resource problem here. You go back to the marketing manager with your "No" for the project to run on local servers. You want to obtain permission to use AWS  Amazon Web Services . Your marketing manager immediately lets you use it. Obtaining those centroids per location cluster is critical to the business plan of the company.  [ 131 ]   When and How to Use Artificial Intelligence  Chapter 7  Proving your point While you are gone, the IT department try to run a query on the SQL server database on one continent and the Oracle database on another. They come up with the duration per location but simply cannot provide the centroids and clusters. They are puzzled because they would like to avoid using AWS. Now that they've tried and failed, they are ready to move forward and get the project rolling. They need an explanation first.  Never force a team to do what you think is necessary without proving why it is necessary. The explanation must be clear and each part of the project must be broken down into elementary parts that everybody can understand, including yourself!  You start by explaining that solving a k-means clustering problem is NP-hard. The P stands for polynomial and the N for non-deterministic.   cid:47  cid:49  cid:15  cid:73  cid:66  cid:83  cid:69  cid:2  cid:97  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:78  cid:70  cid:66  cid:79  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:80  cid:71  cid:2  cid:49  The P here means that the time to solve or verify the solution of a problem is polynomial  poly=many, nomial=terms . For example, x3 is a polynomial.  Once x is known, then x3 will be computed. Applied to 3,000,000,000 records, an estimation can be applied:  x3 = 3,000,000^3  It seems a lot but it isn't that much for two reasons:  In a world of big data, the number can be subject to large-scale randomized sampling K-means clustering can be trained by mini-batches  subsets of the dataset  to speed up computations  The big difference between a polynomial function and an exponential function relies, in this case, on x being the variable, and 3 the exponent.  In an exponential function, x would be the variable and 3 the constant. With x as an exponent, the time to solve this problem would be exponential. It's certainly not a polynomial time you can predict.  33,000,000,000 is something you don't even want to think about!  [ 132 ]   When and How to Use Artificial Intelligence  Chapter 7  Polynomial time means that this time will be more or less proportional to the size of the input. Even if the time it takes to train the k-means clustering remains a bit fuzzy, as long as the time it will take to verify the solution remains proportional to the size of the input, the problem remains a polynomial.  The IT department feels better about the problem. The volume of the training process will overload their servers. They do not have the time to purchase a server and set it up.   cid:47  cid:49  cid:15  cid:73  cid:66  cid:83  cid:69  cid:2  cid:97  cid:2  cid:53  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:78  cid:70  cid:66  cid:79  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:80  cid:71  cid:2  cid:79  cid:80  cid:79  cid:15  cid:69  cid:70  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:78  cid:74  cid:79  cid:74  cid:84  cid:85  cid:74  cid:68  The IT department tried to find a solution with a query but did not succeed.  Non-deterministic problems require a heuristic approach, which implies some form of practical approach. The most widespread heuristic is trial and error. K-means goes beyond trial and error. It is more like a progressive-iterative approximation of the goals to attain.  In any case, k-means clustering requires a well-tuned algorithm to solve the volume of data involved in this project.   cid:53  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:78  cid:70  cid:66  cid:79  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:80  cid:71  cid:2  cid:73  cid:66  cid:83  cid:69  NP-hard, as opposed to NP, can solve a problem in a straightforward deterministic way, without a non-deterministic method.  The IT department is not only satisfied with the answer but also very pleased that you took the time to explain why AWS was necessary and did not just say, "The boss said so."  AI requires clear explanations and scientific proof of its necessity.  The last question comes up: what are mini-batches and how are they used?  Random sampling A large portion of machine learning and deep learning contains random sampling in various forms. In this case, a training set of 3,000,000,000 elements will prove difficult to implement without random sampling.  [ 133 ]   When and How to Use Artificial Intelligence  Chapter 7  Random sampling applies to many methods as described in this book: Monte Carlo, stochastic gradient descent, and many others. No matter what name the sampling takes, they share common concepts to various degrees depending on the size of the dataset. The following description fits the Monte Carlo philosophy.  The law of large numbers  cid:97  LLN In probability, the law of large numbers states that when dealing with very large volumes of data, significant samples can be effective enough to represent the whole set of data. We are all familiar with polling, for example, a population on all sorts of subjects.  This principle, like all principles, has its merits and limits. But whatever its limitations, this law applies to everyday machine learning algorithms.  In machine learning, sampling resembles polling. The right, smaller number of individuals makes up efficient datasets.  In machine learning, the word "mini-batch" replaces a group of people in the polling system.   Sampling mini-batches and averaging them can prove as efficient as calculating the whole dataset as long as a scientific method is applied:  Training with mini-batches or subsets of data Using an estimator in one form or another to measure the progression of the training session until a goal has been reached  You may be surprised to see "until a goal has been reached" and not "the optimal solution."  The optimal solution may not represent the best solution. All the features and all the parameters are often not expressed. This makes being too precise useless.  In this case, the marketing manager wants to know where the centroids  geometric center  of each cluster  region of locations  have been computed for his marketing campaign. The corporation may decide to open a new company at the location of each centroid and provide additional services through local spin-offs to increase their market penetration.  Taking that into account, a centroid does not need to be extremely precise. Finding the nearest large city within a reasonable distance will prove good enough.  The LLN explains why random functions are widely used in machine learning and deep learning.  [ 134 ]   When and How to Use Artificial Intelligence  Chapter 7  The central limit theorem As shown in by the LLN applied to this business case, the k-means clustering project must provide a reasonable set of centroids and clusters  regions of locations for long-duration phone calls .  This approach can now be extended to the CLT, which states, in machine learning parlance, that when training a large dataset, a subset of mini-batch samples is sufficient. The following two conditions define the main properties of the central limit theorem:  The variance between the data points of the subset  mini-batch  remains reasonable. In this case, filtering only long-duration calls solves the problem. The normal distribution pattern with mini-batch variances close to the variance of the whole dataset.   cid:54  cid:84  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:66  cid:2  cid:46  cid:80  cid:79  cid:85  cid:70  cid:2  cid:36  cid:66  cid:83  cid:77  cid:80  cid:2  cid:70  cid:84  cid:85  cid:74  cid:78  cid:66  cid:85  cid:80  cid:83  The name Monte Carlo comes from the casinos in Monte Carlo and gambling. Gambling represents an excellent memoryless random example. No matter what happens before a gambler plays, prior knowledge provides no insight.  Applied to machine learning, the sum of the distribution of f x  is computed. Then random samples are extracted from the following dataset: x1, x2, x3, ..., xn.  No matter what form f x  takes, such as in a k-means clustering process, to estimate the average result, it can be represented by the following equation:  The estimator  cid:103  represents an average of the result of the k-means clustering algorithm or any model implemented.  [ 135 ]   When and How to Use Artificial Intelligence  Chapter 7  Random sampling applications Random sampling can be applied to many functions and methods as we will see in subsequent chapters in this book: Monte Carlo sampling, as described previously, and stochastic gradient descent by extracting samples from the dataset to evaluate the cost function and many other functions.  Randomness represents a key asset when dealing with large datasets.  Cloud solutions  cid:97  AWS  Implementing large number data volumes involves using server resources in one form or the other. We have to use on-premise servers or cloud platforms. In this case, it has been decided to outsource server resources and algorithm development to face a large amount of data billion to train.  Several online cloud services offer the solution to machine learning projects. In this chapter, the project was carried out with AWS SageMaker on an AWS S3 data management platform.  Preparing your baseline model 3,000,000 records containing two features, adding up to a 6,000,000 cell matrix dataset, require mini-batches as defined in the next section through hyperparameters.  In the AWS interface, the size of a mini-batch will be a number. To see what it does, let's apply a mini-batch to the Python program example of  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:24 , Don't Get Lost in Techniques  cid:96  Focus on Optimizing Your Solutions.

Training a random sample of the training dataset Before spending resources on AWS, we must prepare a model locally and make sure it works. AWS possesses efficient mini-batch algorithms. But to master them, a local baseline will guarantee good AWS job management.

As such, it trains unlabeled data. One random computation does not consume a high level of machine resources, but several random selections in a row can.  Shuffling can reduce machine consumption costs.  Proper shuffling of the data before starting training, just like shuffling cards before a Poker game, will avoid repetitive and random mini-batch computations.

You can create a bucket on Amazon S3. On other platforms, different names are used but the concept remains the same. Your data has to reach the platform one way or the other with an API, a data connection, or loading of the data. In the present example, the best choice remains a bucket, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 141 ]   When and How to Use Artificial Intelligence  Chapter 7  Uploading files Once the bucket has been created, files can be loaded in various formats.

Then, depending on corporate practices, the data could be streamed to AWS in batches or loaded in batches.  Training will take many hours of working on the hyperparameters and result analyzing.  [ 147 ]   When and How to Use Artificial Intelligence  Chapter 7  Summary In any machine learning project, we should start by proving that classical programs using SQL queries will not suffice. Then, a baseline or prototype using a sample should prove that the model will work.  Using a cloud platform such as AWS SageMaker with S3 will save corporate investment resources in order to focus on the training job. This proves once again that the future of artificial intelligence experts relies upon their ability to imagine solutions and not to get lost in programming.  No matter what happens, the basic steps will always remain the same, which include proving that artificial intelligence is necessary, building a prototype model, dataset management, and hyperparameter and job optimization.  Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft, and others will be offering more platforms, frameworks, and resources for machine learning. These platforms will constantly evolve and change. As these giants innovate, programming will become less and less necessary so that all companies, small or large, can access the AI cloud platforms. Programming AI will remain fascinating as well as standard non-AI development. However, nothing will stop cloud ready-to-use platforms from expanding.  These platforms are the cutting edge of artificial intelligence and will lead you to the fascinating frontier of present knowledge. You can cross the border into the wild and discover new ways of solving hard problems. A cloud platform has limits that you can push much further, as we will discover in the next chapter.

A huge amount of work remains to be done. To achieve progress, everybody must get involved, as shown in this chapter. Even if Google, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, and others offer a solution, it does not mean it cannot be improved by third parties as add-ons to existing solutions or new standalone products. After all, once Ford invented the Model T over a hundred years ago, it did not mean it was no use inventing other better cars. On the contrary, look around you!  This chapter first explains the differences between inventions, innovations, disruption, high-priced products, revolutions, and how to innovate in AI no matter what.  Then Google Translate will be explored to illustrate innovation concepts using natural language processing. This is a prerequisite to building not only translation solutions but also chatbots  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:23 , Cognitive NLP Chatbots, and  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:24 , Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots .  Google Translate entered the market in 2006 and was enhanced by neural networks in 2016, but still it often produces bad answers. Is that good news or bad news?

The word "disruptive" is more often than not associated with artificial intelligence. Media hype tells us that AI robots will soon have replaced humans around the world. Although media hype made it much easier to obtain AI budgets, we need to know where we stand if we want to implement an AI solution. If we want to innovate, we need to find the cutting edge and build new ideas from there.   [ 151 ]   Revolutions Designed for Some Corporations and Disruptive Innovations for Small to Large Companies Why not just plunge into the tools and see what happens? Is that a good idea or a risky one? Unlike corporations with huge budgets, a single human has limited resources. If you spend time learning in the wrong direction, it will take months to gather enough experience in another better direction to reach your goal. For example, suppose you have trouble classifying large amounts of data  see the example in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:25 , When and How to Use Artificial Intelligence ; you spend months on a project on a server in your company and fail.

Chapter 8  Before diving into a project, find out the best way to start it.  What is new and what isn't in AI Most AI theory and tools have been around for decades, if not centuries. We often tend to think that since something appears new to us, it has just been invented or discovered. This mistake can prove fatal in many projects. If you know that a theory or function has been around for decades or centuries, you can do some deep research and use solutions found 100+ years ago to solve your present problems.  Finding out what is new and what is not will make a major difference in your personal or professional AI projects.  AI is based on mathematical theories that are not new Artificial intelligence theory presently relies heavily on applied mathematics. In  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19 , Become an Adaptive Thinker, the Markov Decision Process  MDP  was described. Google  Brain has proudly and rightly so won some competitions using the MDP combined with neural networks.  However, Andrey Andreyevich Markov was a Russian mathematician born in 1856 who invented the MDP among other functions. Richard Bellman published an enhanced version of the Markov Decision Process in 1957.  Bellman also coined the expression "curse of dimensionality" and published books on mathematical tools widely used today in AI. It is now well known that dimensionality reduction can be performed to avoid facing thousands of dimensions  features, for example  in an algorithm.

Chapter 8  Thomas Bayes  1701-1761  invented the theorem that bears his name: Bayes' Theorem. It is widely used in artificial intelligence.  In fact, almost all of the applied mathematics in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning can be traced from 17th-century to 20th-century mathematicians.  We must look elsewhere for 21st century AI innovations.

We must again look elsewhere for 21st AI innovations.  Cloud server power, data volumes, and web sharing of the early 21st century started to make AI disruptive  The first sign of AI's innovative disruption appeared between 2000 and 2010. Before then, the internet existed, and servers existed. But starting from around 2005, cloud servers were made widely available. With that kind of computer power, developers around the world could try using the highly greedy resources required by machine learning and deep learning.   At the same moment, as powerful servers became available, the internet provided the largest library of knowledge in the history of mankind.   On top of that, social networking became widely used. Sharing discoveries and source code became commonplace. The World Wide Web  WWW  encouraged open source software, boosting local research and development.  [ 153 ]   Revolutions Designed for Some Corporations and Disruptive Innovations for Small to Large Companies The era of artificial intelligence became possible for local experts starting from the middle of the first decade of the 21st century.  Chapter 8  What makes artificial appear as an innovation today is the conjunction of more powerful machines and the availability of intellectual resources.   Public awareness contributed to making AI disruptive  Public awareness of artificial intelligence remained dim for several years after the cloud architectural revolution occurred from around 1995 to 2005.  Artificial intelligence hit us hard by around 2015 when we all woke up realizing that AI could massively replace humans and create job displacement at levels never seen in human history.  Worse, we realized that machines could beat us in fields we took pride in, such as chess   cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:21 , Apply Machine Thinking to a Human Problem , the game of Go, other video games, manufacturing jobs with robots, office jobs with bots, and more fields that appear every day.   For the first time in human history, the human species can be surpassed by a new species: bots. As developers, we thought we were safe until Google presented AutoML, a solution that could create machine learning solutions better than humans. At the same time, ready- to-use machine learning platforms have spread that can reduce and even replace AI software development.  Artificial intelligence forces awe and fear upon us. How far will machines go? Will we simply experience job displacement or will it go as far as species replacement?   Could this be an opportunity for many? Who knows? In any case, this chapter provides solutions to constantly innovating and being useful as humans.  Inventions versus innovations Some artificial intelligence programs, especially deep learning algorithms, remained inventions and not innovations until they were widely used by Google and other major players.  [ 154 ]   Revolutions Designed for Some Corporations and Disruptive Innovations for Small to Large Companies If you have invented a better algorithm than Google for some applications, it remains an invention until it actually changes something in your corporation or on the Web.   Chapter 8  Suppose you find a quicker way to recognize an image through an optimized number of neurons and a new activation function. If nobody uses it, then that invention remains a personal theoretical fining no matter how good it appears. When others begin to use this new algorithm, then it becomes an innovation.  An invention becomes an innovation only when it changes a process within a company or by a sufficient number of private users.  Revolutionary versus disruptive solutions Suppose the new image recognition algorithm described just now becomes an innovation in a significant corporation. This new algorithm has gone from being an invention  not really used  to an innovation  a solution making a difference .  The corporation now widely uses the algorithm. Every subsidiary has access to it. For this corporation, the new image recognition algorithm has attained revolutionary status. Corporate sales have gone up, and profit margins have as well.  But maybe this corporation does not dominate the market and nobody has followed its example. The innovation remains revolutionary but has not become disruptive.  Then the person who created the algorithm decides to leave the company and start a business with the algorithm. It appears on GitHub as an open source program. Everybody wants it and the number of downloads increases daily until 1,000,000+ users have begun to implement it. Some very low priced add-ons are provided on the company website. Within a year, it becomes the new way of recognizing images. All companies must follow suit or stay behind. The solution has become disruptive because it has globally changed its market.  Where to start? We have finished reading about such fantastic innovations and have tested mind-blowing AI solutions, knowing that all of this can be discouraging. Where to start? First of all, even if a solution exists, it has limits and can be improved, customized, packaged, and sold. This means that if there is a limit, there is a market.  [ 155 ]   Revolutions Designed for Some Corporations and Disruptive Innovations for Small to Large Companies Never criticize the flaws you find in an AI solution. They are gold mines!  Chapter 8  Where there is a limit, there lies an opportunity.  Let's go to the cutting edge and then over the border into unchartered territory using Google Translate to illustrate this.  Discover a world of opportunities with Google Translate Starting out with Google Translate to explore natural language processing  NLP  is a good way to prepare for chatbots. Any disruptive web-based solution must be able to run in at least a few languages.   Google provides many resources to use, explore, or improve Google Translate. Getting a Python code to run and then assess the quality of the results will prove vital before implementing it for crucial translations in a company.  Getting started Go the Google's developers API Client Libary page:  cid:73  cid:85  cid:85  cid:81  cid:84  cid:28  cid:17  cid:17  cid:69  cid:70  cid:87  cid:70  cid:77  cid:80  cid:81  cid:70  cid:83  cid:84  cid:16  cid:72  cid:80  cid:80  cid:72  cid:77  cid:70  cid:16  cid:68  cid:80  cid:78  cid:17  cid:66  cid:81  cid:74  cid:15   cid:68  cid:77  cid:74  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:15  cid:77  cid:74  cid:67  cid:83  cid:66  cid:83  cid:90  cid:17 . On that page, you will see libraries for many languages: Java, PHP, .NET, JavaScript, Objective-C, Dart, Ruby,Node.js, Go, and probably more to come.   This does not change a thing about reaching the limits of Google Translate and entering the adventurous frontier of innovating the linguistic dimension of AI described in this chapter.  Then click on the GET STARTED option under Python. Follow the instructions to sign up, create a project in the Google API Console, and install the library.  To install the library, use  cid:81  cid:74  cid:81   preferred :   cid:6  cid:2  cid:81  cid:74  cid:81  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:77  cid:77  cid:15  cid:15  cid:86  cid:81  cid:72  cid:83  cid:66  cid:69  cid:70  cid:2  cid:72  cid:80  cid:80  cid:72  cid:77  cid:70  cid:15  cid:66  cid:81  cid:74  cid:15  cid:81  cid:90  cid:85  cid:73  cid:80  cid:79  cid:15  cid:68  cid:77  cid:74  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85   [ 156 ]   Revolutions Designed for Some Corporations and Disruptive Innovations for Small to Large Companies  Chapter 8  If you encounter problems doing this part or do not wish to install anything yet, this chapter is self-contained. The source code is described in the chapter.  You are now ready to go ahead, whether you installed the tools or not.  The program The goal of this section is to implement Google Translate functionality. You can follow the steps and get it working or simply read the chapter to get the idea.  The header The standard Google header provided by Google was enough for the program I wrote, as shown in the following code.   cid:71  cid:83  cid:80  cid:78  cid:2  cid:72  cid:80  cid:80  cid:72  cid:77  cid:70  cid:66  cid:81  cid:74  cid:68  cid:77  cid:74  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:16  cid:69  cid:74  cid:84  cid:68  cid:80  cid:87  cid:70  cid:83  cid:90  cid:2  cid:74  cid:78  cid:81  cid:80  cid:83  cid:85  cid:2  cid:67  cid:86  cid:74  cid:77  cid:69   Considering the many languages Google manages, special characters are a major problem to handle. Many forums and example programs on the Web struggle with the  cid:54  cid:53  cid:39  cid:15  cid:26  header when using Google Translate. Many solutions are suggested, such as the following source code header.   cid:5  cid:2  cid:15  cid:12  cid:15  cid:2  cid:68  cid:80  cid:69  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:28  cid:2  cid:86  cid:85  cid:71  cid:15  cid:26  cid:2  cid:15  cid:12  cid:15   Then, when Google translate returns the result, more problems occur and many develop their own functions. They work fine but I was looking for a straightforward one-line solution. The goal here was not to have many lines of code but focus on the limit of Google Translate to discover the cutting-edge interpreting languages in AI.  So, I did not use the  cid:54  cid:53  cid:39  cid:15  cid:26  header but implemented this HTML parser.   cid:74  cid:78  cid:81  cid:80  cid:83  cid:85  cid:2  cid:73  cid:85  cid:78  cid:77  cid:16  cid:81  cid:66  cid:83  cid:84  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:66  cid:84  cid:2  cid:73  cid:85  cid:78  cid:77  cid:81  cid:66  cid:83  cid:84  cid:70  cid:83   cid:81  cid:66  cid:83  cid:84  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:73  cid:85  cid:78  cid:77  cid:81  cid:66  cid:83  cid:84  cid:70  cid:83  cid:16  cid:41  cid:53  cid:46  cid:45  cid:49  cid:66  cid:83  cid:84  cid:70  cid:83  cid:10  cid:11   When confronted with a result, the following one-line HTML parser code did the job.   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:4  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:86  cid:77  cid:85  cid:28  cid:4  cid:14  cid:81  cid:66  cid:83  cid:84  cid:70  cid:83  cid:16  cid:86  cid:79  cid:70  cid:84  cid:68  cid:66  cid:81  cid:70  cid:10  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:86  cid:77  cid:85  cid:11  cid:11   It works well because, in fact, Google will return an HTML string or a text string depending on what option you implement. This means that the HTML parser can do the job.  [ 157 ]   Revolutions Designed for Some Corporations and Disruptive Innovations for Small to Large Companies Implementing Google's translation service  Google's translation service needs at least three values to return a result:  Chapter 8   cid:69  cid:70  cid:87  cid:70  cid:77  cid:80  cid:81  cid:70  cid:83  cid:44  cid:70  cid:90 : This is the API key obtained at the end of the "getting started" process described previously  cid:82  cid:31  cid:4  cid:85  cid:70  cid:89  cid:85  cid:2  cid:85  cid:80  cid:2  cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:84  cid:77  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70  cid:4 : In my code, I used  cid:84  cid:80  cid:86  cid:83  cid:68  cid:70   cid:85  cid:66  cid:83  cid:72  cid:70  cid:85  cid:31  cid:4  cid:66  cid:67  cid:67  cid:83  cid:70  cid:87  cid:74  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:80  cid:71  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:84  cid:77  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70  cid:69  cid:2  cid:85  cid:70  cid:89  cid:85  cid:4 :  cid:70  cid:79  for English,  cid:71  cid:83  for French, and so on  More options are available as described in the following sections.

It is disruptive, has changed the world, and can replace translators in many corporations for all corporate needs.   Fantastic!  Happy ending?  In fact, we could end the chapter here, go to our favorite social network, and build some hype on our translation project!  Well, not yet! The CEO, who happens to be the main shareholder of Example-Corporation, wants to make sure that everything really works before firing the 20 freelance translators working in the corporation.  The CEO phones a linguist from Example_University and asks for some expert advice. The next day, professor Ustiling comes in, gray-haired and smiling, "You can call me Usty. So let's get to work!"  Google Translate from a linguist's perspective Usty is fascinated by Google Translate as presented previously. The possibilities seem endless.  Usty applies a linguist's approach to the program.   By the time this book is published, maybe Google will have improved the examples in this chapter. But don't worry; in this case, you will quickly find hundreds of other examples that are incorrect. The journey has just begun!

Usty has a worried look on his face. The corporate project teams ask him what is wrong.  Usty starts an assessment of Google Translate.  Linguistic assessment of Google Translate Professor Usty both wants to assess Google Translate correctly and likes limits.  Limits are the boundaries researchers crave for! We are frontiersmen!  Usty starts an expert assessment that will lead the project team to the frontier and beyond.   cid:45  cid:70  cid:89  cid:74  cid:68  cid:66  cid:77  cid:2  cid:96  cid:70  cid:77  cid:69  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:80  cid:83  cid:90  Lexical fields describe word fields. A word only acquires its full meanings in a context. This context often goes beyond a few other words or even a sentence.  [ 160 ]   Revolutions Designed for Some Corporations and Disruptive Innovations for Small to Large Companies Chercher des poux translated as such means look for lice. But in French, it can mean looking for trouble or literally looking for lice. The result Google Translate comes up with contains three basic problems.  Chapter 8   cid:84  cid:80  cid:86  cid:83  cid:68  cid:70  cid:31  cid:9  cid:68  cid:73  cid:70  cid:83  cid:68  cid:73  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:69  cid:70  cid:84  cid:2  cid:81  cid:80  cid:86  cid:89  cid:9   cid:32  cid:32  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:86  cid:77  cid:85  cid:28  cid:2  cid:77  cid:80  cid:80  cid:76  cid:2  cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:77  cid:74  cid:68  cid:70   Problem 1, the lexical field: There is no way of knowing whether this means really looking for lice or looking for trouble without a context.  Problem 2, metaphors or idiomatic expressions: Suppose you have to translate this is giving you a headache. There is no way of knowing whether it is a physical problem or a metaphor meaning this is driving you crazy. These two idiomatic expressions happen to have the same metaphors when translated into French. But the lice metaphor in French means nothing in English.  Problem 3: chercher is an infinitive in French and the result should have been looking for lice in English. But chercher des limites est int cid:98 ressant provides the right answer, which is looking for:   cid:84  cid:80  cid:86  cid:83  cid:68  cid:70  cid:31  cid:9  cid:36  cid:73  cid:70  cid:83  cid:68  cid:73  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:69  cid:70  cid:84  cid:2  cid:77  cid:74  cid:78  cid:74  cid:85  cid:70  cid:84  cid:2  cid:70  cid:84  cid:85  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:98  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:84  cid:66  cid:79  cid:85  cid:16  cid:9   cid:32  cid:32  cid:32  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:86  cid:77  cid:85  cid:28  cid:45  cid:80  cid:80  cid:76  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:67  cid:80  cid:86  cid:79  cid:69  cid:66  cid:83  cid:74  cid:70  cid:84  cid:2  cid:74  cid:84  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:85  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:16   The answer is correct because is splits the sentence into two, making it easier for Google Translate to identify chercher as the first part of a sentence, thus using looking in English.  Professor Usty looks excited by these limits but this worries the project team. Will this project be shelved by the CEO or not?   cid:43  cid:66  cid:83  cid:72  cid:80  cid:79  Jargon arises when fields specialize. In AI, hidden neurons are jargon. This expression means nothing for a lawyer for example. A lawyer may think you have hidden intelligence on the subject somewhere or are hiding money in a cryptocurrency called hidden neuron.  In the same way, if somebody asks an artificial intelligence expert to explain how to file a motion, that would prove difficult.  In a legal corporate environment, beyond using Google Translate as a dictionary, translating sentences might be risky if only a random number of results prove to be correct.

In English, SAS means Special Air Forces. Then comes the grammar that does not sound right.   A translator would write better English and also specify what a SAS is:  "A SAS  a type of company in France  must follow the recommendations that cover commercial practices."  Translating often means interpreting, not simply translating words.  In this case, a legal translator may interpret the text in a contract and go as far as writing:  The COMPANY must respect the legal obligation to treat all customers fairly.  The legal translator will suggest that COMPANY be defined in the contract so as to avoid confusions such as the one Google Translate just made.  At this point, the project team is ready to give up. They are totally discouraged!  When reading about natural language processing, chatbots, and translation, everything seems easy. However, really working on Google Translate can easily turn into a nightmare!   How can they go back to their CEO with Usty and explain that Google Translate provides a random quality of results?

Be careful. If Google Translate provides randomly correct answers in another language, then you have no way of knowing whether the translation is reliable or not.

Maybe this will be achieved even by the time you read this book or with some workarounds as shown in the next section. But a human translator will find hundreds of expressions Google Translate cannot deal with yet.   Understanding a sentence in your native language can prove difficult when a word or an expression has several meanings. Adding a translation function to the issue makes it even more difficult to provide a reliable answer.  And that is where we reach the frontier, just beyond the cutting edge.  As a researcher, Usty seems overexcited in contrast to the look of despair on the project team's faces. But soon the project team will share the excitement of discovering new AI lands.   AI as a new frontier Google has a great but very limited translation program. Use the flaws to innovate! AI research and development has just scratched the surface of the innovations to come.  First, implement an AI solution. Then use it for what it is. But don't accept its limits. Don't be negative about it. Innovate! Imagine ideas or listen to other ideas you like, and build solutions in a team! Google might even publish your solutions!  [ 164 ]   Revolutions Designed for Some Corporations and Disruptive Innovations for Small to Large Companies Usty's excitement is contagious. The project team would like to build a prototype program. Usty suggests forgetting about generalizing the solution for the moment and just focusing on customizing Google Translation for their corporation. Usty decides to dive directly with the team into a prototype Python program:  cid:40  cid:80  cid:80  cid:72  cid:77  cid:70  cid:64  cid:53  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:84  cid:77  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70  cid:64  cid:36  cid:86  cid:84  cid:85  cid:80  cid:78  cid:74  cid:91  cid:70  cid:69  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90 .  Chapter 8  Lexical field and polysemy A lexical field contains words that form sets and subsets. They differ from one language to another. A language itself forms a set and contain subsets of lexical fields.   Colder countries have more words describing water in its frozen form than tropical countries where snow hardly ever falls. A lexical field of cold could be a subset of C:  C = {ice, hail, snowflakes, snowman, slushy, powder, flake, snowball, blizzard, melting, crunch....n}  The curse of dimensionality, well known in artificial intelligence, applies here. Words contain an incredible number of dimensions and definitions. To translate certain expressions, Google Translate suppresses their dimension and reduces them.  Google Translate often uses n-grams to translate. An n-gram is a fixed- length sequence of tokens. Tokens can be a word, a character or even numerical representations of words and characters.  The probability that token n means something is calculated given the preceding following n - x or n + x tokens. x is a variable depending on the algorithm applied.  For example, slushy has a special meaning in the expression slushy snow. The snow is partly melting, it's watery and making slush sound when we walk through it. Melting is only a component of the meaning of slush.  Google Translate, at this point, will only translate slushy snow in French by:  Google Translate will also translate melting snow by:   neige  snow  fondante  melting    neige  snow  fondante  melting   [ 165 ]   Revolutions Designed for Some Corporations and Disruptive Innovations for Small to Large Companies To translate slushy into French, you have to use a phrase. To find that phrase, you need some imagination or have some parsed  searched  novels or other higher levels of speech representations. That takes time and resources. It will most probably take years before Google Translate reaches an acceptable native level in all the languages publicized.  Chapter 8  Another dimension to take into account is polysemy.   Polysemy means a word can have several very different meanings in a language. The equivalent word in another language may simply have one meaning or other, very different meanings.  "Go + over" in English can mean go over a bridge or go over some notes. At this point  hopefully, it will improve by the time you read this book , it is translated in both cases in French by aller sur. This means to go on  not over , which is incorrect in both cases. Prepositions in English constitute a field in themselves, generating many meanings with the same word. The verb go can have a wide list of meanings: go up  upstairs , go up  stock market , go down  downstairs , go down  fall apart , and many more possibilities.   Linguistics involves many more concepts and techniques than just statistics. More will be described in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:23 , Cognitive NLP Chatbots, and  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:24 , Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots.

As explained, this only remains a probability and may not be correct.  We are not seeking perfection at this point but an improvement.  Exploring the frontier  cid:97  the program Now it's time to add some customized novelties. The use of the vectors in this section will be explained in the next section, again through the source code that uses them.  A trigger vector will force the program to try an alternate method to translate a mistranslated sentence. When the sentence has been identified and if its value in  cid:57  cid:20  is equal to 1, it triggers a deeper translation function as implemented here:   cid:57  cid:20  cid:31  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:62    cid:18  and  cid:19  are flags. Each value represents a line in  cid:57 .   Note for developers: To use this method correctly, all the values of this vector should be set to 1. That will automatically use several alternate methods to translate Google Translate errors. A lot of work remains to be done here.   The case study is a transportation business. A transport phrase dictionary should be built. In this case, a general  cid:81  cid:73  cid:83  cid:66  cid:84  cid:70  cid:64  cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:84  cid:77  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70  dictionary has been implemented with one expression, as shown in the following array.   cid:81  cid:73  cid:83  cid:66  cid:84  cid:70  cid:64  cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:84  cid:77  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:31  cid:60  cid:9  cid:9  cid:14  cid:9  cid:9  cid:14  cid:9  cid:9  cid:14  cid:9  cid:42  cid:77  cid:2  cid:70  cid:84  cid:85  cid:2  cid:66  cid:72  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:9  cid:14  cid:9  cid:9  cid:14  cid:9  cid:9  cid:14  cid:9  cid:9  cid:14  cid:9  cid:9  cid:14  cid:9  cid:9  cid:14  cid:9  cid:9  cid:14  cid:9  cid:9  cid:14  cid:9  cid:9  cid:62   [ 167 ]   Revolutions Designed for Some Corporations and Disruptive Innovations for Small to Large Companies What remains to be done to fill up this dictionary ?  Chapter 8  Scan all the documents of the company cid:100 emails, letters, contracts, and every form of written documents. Store the words and sentences.

What Google Translate cannot do on a global scale, you can implement at a local scale to greatly improve the system.   k-nearest neighbor algorithm No matter how you address a linguistic problem, it will always boil down to the word "context". When somebody does not understand somebody else, they say, you took my words out of their context or that is not what I meant; let me explain...  In  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:24 , Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots, the embedding Word2Vector method will be explored. In any case, "proximity" and "nearness" remain the key concepts.  As explained before, in many cases, you cannot translate a word or expression without a lexical field. The difficulty remains proportional to the polysemy property as the program will show.  Using the k-nearest neighbor  KNN  algorithm as a classification method can prove extremely useful. In fact, any language interpretation  translation or chatbot  will have to use a context-orientated algorithm.   By finding the words closest  neighbors  to each other, KNN will create the lexical fields required to interpret a language. Even better, when provided with the proper datasets, it will solve the polysemy problem as shown in the upcoming sections.  [ 168 ]   Revolutions Designed for Some Corporations and Disruptive Innovations for Small to Large Companies  cid:53  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:44  cid:47  cid:47  cid:2  cid:66  cid:77  cid:72  cid:80  cid:83  cid:74  cid:85  cid:73  cid:78  Generally, a word requires a context to mean something. Looking for "neighbors" close by provides an efficient way to determine where the word belongs.  Chapter 8  KNN is supervised because it uses the labels of the data provided to train its algorithm. KNN, in this case, is used for classification purposes. For a given point p, KNN will calculate the distances to all other points. Then k represents the k-nearest neighbors to take into account.  Let's clear this up through an example. In English, the word "coach" can mean a trainer on a football field, a bus, or a railroad passenger car. Since the prototype is for a transportation company, "coach" will mostly be a bus that should not be confused with a trainer:  Step 1: Parsing  examining in a detailed manner  texts with "coach" as a bus and "coach" as a trainer. Thus the program is searching for three target words: trainer, bus, and coach. Step 2: Finding some words that appear close to the target words we are searching. As recommended do the following:  Parse all the company documents you can use with a standard program Use a Python function such as  cid:74  cid:71  cid:10  cid:79  cid:72  cid:83  cid:66  cid:78  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:84  cid:80  cid:86  cid:83  cid:68  cid:70  cid:11  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:79   cid:84  cid:85  cid:80  cid:83  cid:70  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66   In this case, the  cid:55  cid:19  cid:16  cid:68  cid:84  cid:87  shown in the following output excerpt provided with the source code contains the result of such a parsing function:   cid:67  cid:83  cid:80  cid:76  cid:70  cid:14  cid:83  cid:80  cid:66  cid:69  cid:14  cid:84  cid:85  cid:80  cid:81  cid:81  cid:70  cid:69  cid:14  cid:84  cid:73  cid:80  cid:86  cid:85  cid:70  cid:69  cid:14  cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84   cid:19  cid:14  cid:21  cid:16  cid:23  cid:14  cid:24  cid:16  cid:22  cid:14  cid:27  cid:14  cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:74  cid:79  cid:70  cid:83   cid:19  cid:14  cid:21  cid:16  cid:18  cid:14  cid:23  cid:16  cid:22  cid:14  cid:27  cid:14  cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:74  cid:79  cid:70  cid:83   cid:19  cid:14  cid:21  cid:16  cid:20  cid:14  cid:24  cid:16  cid:21  cid:14  cid:27  cid:14  cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:74  cid:79  cid:70  cid:83   cid:16  cid:16  cid:16   cid:24  cid:16  cid:22  cid:14  cid:24  cid:16  cid:20  cid:14  cid:27  cid:16  cid:23  cid:14  cid:19  cid:16  cid:23  cid:14  cid:67  cid:86  cid:84   cid:20  cid:14  cid:21  cid:16  cid:20  cid:14  cid:27  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:67  cid:86  cid:84   cid:24  cid:16  cid:22  cid:14  cid:24  cid:16  cid:20  cid:14  cid:27  cid:16  cid:23  cid:14  cid:19  cid:16  cid:23  cid:14  cid:67  cid:86  cid:84   cid:16  cid:16  cid:16   cid:21  cid:16  cid:21  cid:14  cid:25  cid:16  cid:21  cid:14  cid:21  cid:16  cid:18  cid:14  cid:20  cid:16  cid:23  cid:14  cid:68  cid:80  cid:66  cid:68  cid:73   cid:22  cid:16  cid:25  cid:14  cid:23  cid:16  cid:25  cid:14  cid:21  cid:16  cid:19  cid:14  cid:21  cid:16  cid:25  cid:14  cid:68  cid:80  cid:66  cid:68  cid:73   cid:20  cid:16  cid:18  cid:14  cid:24  cid:16  cid:18  cid:14  cid:20  cid:16  cid:25  cid:14  cid:21  cid:16  cid:19  cid:14  cid:68  cid:80  cid:66  cid:68  cid:73   The program parsed emails, documents, and contracts.

[ 169 ]   Revolutions Designed for Some Corporations and Disruptive Innovations for Small to Large Companies Progressively, the words that came out with "trainer" were "shouted" more than "stopped." For a bus, "broke"  broken down as in breaking down , "road" and "stopped" appeared more than "shout."  Chapter 8  "Coach" appeared on an average of "shouted", "stopped", "road" and broke because it could be either a trainer or a bus, hence the problem we face when translating this word. The polysemy  several meanings  of "coach" can lead to poor translations.  The KNN algorithm loaded the  cid:55  cid:19  cid:16  cid:68  cid:84  cid:87  file that contains the data to be trained and finds the following result:  The  cid:76  cid:79  cid:79  cid:64  cid:81  cid:80  cid:77  cid:90  cid:84  cid:70  cid:78  cid:90  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  program determined the following:  The verb "broke" in blue has a better chance of applying to a bus  x axis value >6  than to a trainer  x axis value <4 . However, "coach" remains above trainer and below "bus" because it can be both. The word "road" follows the same logic as the blue chart. The verb "stopped" can apply to a trainer and more to a bus. "Coach" remains undecided again.  [ 170 ]   Revolutions Designed for Some Corporations and Disruptive Innovations for Small to Large Companies  Chapter 8  The verb "shouted" applies clearly to a trainer more than a bus. "Coach" remains undecided again.  Note that the coordinates of each point in these charts are as follows:  y axis: bus = 1, coach=2, trainer=3 x axis: The value represents the "squashed" occurrence  the number of times the word appeared  values.  This is the result of the search of those words in many sources.   When a new point, a data point named Pn, is introduced in the system, it will find its nearest neighbor s  depending on the value of k.  The KNN algorithm will calculate the Euclidean distance between Pn and all the other points from P1 to Pn-1 using the Euclidean distance formula. The k in KNN represents the number of "nearest neighbors" the calculation will take into account for classification purposes. The Euclidean distance  d1  between two given points, for example, between Pn x1,y1  and P1 x2,y2 , is:  Considering the number of distances to calculate, a function such as the one provided by

cid:90  This program requires more time and focus because of the concepts of linguistics involved. The best way to grasp the algorithm is to run it in order.  Google Translate offers two translation methods, as shown in the following code:   cid:5  cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:9  cid:49  cid:73  cid:83  cid:66  cid:84  cid:70  cid:15  cid:35  cid:66  cid:84  cid:70  cid:69  cid:2  cid:46  cid:66  cid:68  cid:73  cid:74  cid:79  cid:70  cid:2  cid:53  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:84  cid:77  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:10  cid:49  cid:35  cid:46  cid:53  cid:11  cid:78  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:77  cid:28  cid:67  cid:66  cid:84  cid:70  cid:9  cid:11  cid:28  cid:2  cid:5  cid:78  cid:31  cid:9  cid:67  cid:66  cid:84  cid:70  cid:9   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:9  cid:47  cid:70  cid:86  cid:83  cid:66  cid:77  cid:2  cid:46  cid:66  cid:68  cid:73  cid:74  cid:79  cid:70  cid:2  cid:53  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:84  cid:77  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:78  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:77  cid:28  cid:79  cid:78  cid:85  cid:9  cid:11   These are explained as follows:  Phrase-Based Machine Translation  PBMT : This translates the whole sequence of words. The phrase or rather phraseme  multi-word expression  is not always quite a sentence.   [ 173 ]   Revolutions Designed for Some Corporations and Disruptive Innovations for Small to Large Companies  Chapter 8  Neural Machine Translation  NMT : This uses neural networks such as Recurrent Neural Network  RNN , which will be detailed later in this book. This method goes beyond the phraseme and takes the whole sentence into account. On the dataset presented in this chapter, this neural network method provides slightly better results.  Both methods, though interesting, still require the type of additional algorithms, among others, presented in this chapter. As you have seen so far, the subject is extremely complex if you take the lexical fields and structures of the many languages on our planet into account.  Step 1: Translating the X dataset line by line from English into French  The following code calls the translation function:   cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:89  cid:74  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:72  cid:70  cid:10  cid:77  cid:70  cid:79  cid:10  cid:57  cid:11  cid:11  cid:28   cid:84  cid:80  cid:86  cid:83  cid:68  cid:70  cid:31  cid:57  cid:60  cid:89  cid:74  cid:62   cid:85  cid:66  cid:83  cid:72  cid:70  cid:85  cid:77  cid:31  cid:4  cid:71  cid:83  cid:4  cid:29  cid:78  cid:31  cid:9  cid:79  cid:78  cid:85  cid:9   cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:86  cid:77  cid:85  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:72  cid:64  cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:84  cid:77  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70  cid:10  cid:84  cid:80  cid:86  cid:83  cid:68  cid:70  cid:14  cid:85  cid:66  cid:83  cid:72  cid:70  cid:85  cid:77  cid:14  cid:78  cid:11   The code is explained here:   cid:89  cid:74  is the line number in  cid:57 .  cid:84  cid:80  cid:86  cid:83  cid:68  cid:70  is the  cid:89  cid:74  line in  cid:57 .  cid:85  cid:66  cid:83  cid:72  cid:70  cid:85  cid:77  is the target language, in this case,  cid:71  cid:83   French .  cid:78  is the method  PBT or NMT  as described previously. In this case,  cid:79  cid:78  cid:85  is applied. Then the Google Translate function is called as described earlier in this chapter. The result is stored in the  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:86  cid:77  cid:85  variable.  Step 2: Back translation  How can somebody know the correctness of a translation from language L1 to language L2 if L1 is the person's native language and L2 is a language the person does not understand at all?  This is one of the reasons, among others, that translators use back translation to check translations:  Translation = Initial translation from L1 to L2  Back translation = Translation back from L2 to L1  [ 174 ]   Revolutions Designed for Some Corporations and Disruptive Innovations for Small to Large Companies If the initial text is not obtained, then there is probably a problem. In this case, the length of the initial sentence L1 can be compared to the length of the same sentence translated back to L1.

Something may be wrong.  The French sentence sounds wrong too. Fatty food cannot be translated as such. Usually, the common sentence is manger gras meaning eating  manger  fatty  gras  which cannot be translated into English as such.  X[2] an X[3] come back as false as well.

This provides great opportunities for AI linguists, as shown with some of the methods presented to improve Google Translate at a local level that could even go further.  [ 181 ]   Revolutions Designed for Some Corporations and Disruptive Innovations for Small to Large Companies This experiment with Google Translate shows that Google has just scratched the surface of real-life translations that sound right to the native speakers that receive these translations. It would take a real company project to get this on track with a financial analysis of its profitability before consuming resources.  Chapter 8  The disruptive revolutionary loop As you now see, Google Translate, like all artificial intelligence solutions, has limits. Once this limit has been reached, you are at the cutting edge.  Cross the border into AI Frontierland; innovate on your own or with a team.   If you work for a corporation, you can create a revolutionary customized solution for hundreds of users. It does not have to go public. It can remain a strong asset to your company.  At some point or another, the revolutionary add-on will reach beyond the company and others will use it. It will become disruptive.  Finally, others will reach the limit of your now-disruptive solution. They will then innovate and customize it in their corporation as a revolutionary solution. This is what I call the disruptive revolutionary loop. It is challenging and exciting because it means that AI developers will not all be replaced soon by AutoAI bots!  Summary Designing a solution does not mean it will be an invention, an innovation, revolutionary, or disruptive. But that does not really matter. What a company earns with a solution represents more than the novelty of what it sells as long as it is profitable. That is rule number 1. That said, without innovating in its market, that company will not survive through the years.   If a product requires quality for security reasons, it should remain in its invention state as long as necessary. If a product can produce sales at the low end of the market before its total completion, then the company should sell it. The company will acquire a reputation for innovation, get more money to invest, and take over the territory of its competitors.  [ 182 ]   Revolutions Designed for Some Corporations and Disruptive Innovations for Small to Large Companies Google Translate is a good example of disruptive marketing. As shown the theory, the model and even the cloud architecture are over 10 years old. But each time one of the hundreds of millions of users stumbles across it, it creates more disruption by hooking the user onto Google solutions. The user will come back again and again to view more advertisements, and everyone is happy!  Chapter 8  Artificial intelligence has only begun. Google Translate has been around since 2006. However, the results still leave room for developers, linguists, and mathematicians to improve upon. Google has added a neural network, Google NMT, to improve translations by analyzing whole sentences. How long will it take to be really reliable? In the meantime, the next chapter will describe a CNN in more detail and provide ideas to help our community to move AI forward beyond the cutting edge into Frontierland. Before moving on to the next chapter, check your knowledge of some aspects of disruptive innovations.  Questions  1.  2.  3. 4.  5. 6. 7.  8. 9.  It is better to wait until you have a top quality product before putting it on the market?  Yes  No  Considering the investment made, a new product should always be priced high to reach the top segment of the market.  Yes  No  Inventing a new solution will make it known in itself.  Yes  No  Artificial Intelligence can solve most problems without using standard non- learning algorithms.  Yes  No  Google Translate can translate all languages in a satisfactory way.

With its multiple layers  visible and hidden , CNN has brought artificial intelligence from machine learning to deep learning.   A CNN relies on two basic tools of linear algebra: kernels and applying them to convolutions as described in this chapter. These tools have been used in applied mathematics for decades.  However, it took the incredible imagination of Yan LeCunn, Yoshua Bengio, and others cid:100 who built a mathematical model of several layers cid:100 to solve real-life problems with CNNs.  This chapter describes the marvels of CNNs, one of the pillars of Artificial Neural Networks  AANs . A CNN will be built from scratch, trained, and saved. The classification model described will detect production failures on a food-processing production line.  A Python Keras program running with TensorFlow on the backend will be built layer by layer and trained. Additional sample programs will illustrate key functions.

 cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  will illustrate the basic CNN components the chapter used to build the case study model for a food-processing conveyor belt. CNNs constitute one of the pillars of deep learning  multiple layers and neurons .  In this chapter, a Keras neural network written in Python will be running on top of TensorFlow. If you do not have Python or do not wish to program, the chapter is self- contained with graphs and explanations.   Defining a CNN A convolutional neural network takes an image, for example, and processes it until it can be interpreted.   For example, imagine you have to represent the sun with an ordinary pencil and a piece of paper. It is a sunny day, and the sun shines very brightly, too brightly. You put on a special pair of very dense sunglasses. Now you can look at the sun for a few seconds. You have just applied a color reduction filter, one of the first operations of a convolutional network. Then you try to draw the sun. You draw a circle and put some gray in the middle. You have just applied an edge filter. Finally, you go over the circle several times to make it easy to recognize, reducing the image you saw progressively into a representation of it. Now with the circle, some gray in the middle, and a few lines of the rays around it, anybody can see you drew a sun. You smile; you did it! You took a color image of the sun and made a mathematical representation of it as a circle, which would probably look something like this:  You just went through the basic processes of a convolutional network.  [ 187 ]   Getting Your Neurons to Work  Chapter 9  The word convolutional means that you transformed the image of the sun you were looking at into a drawing, area by area. But, you did not look at the whole sky at once. You made many eye movements to capture the sun, area by area, and you did the same when drawing. If you made a mathematical representation of the way you transformed each area from vision to your paper abstraction, it would be a kernel.  With that concept in mind, the following graph shows the successive mathematical steps to follow in this chapter's model for a machine to process an image just as you did. A convolutional network is a succession of steps that will transform what you see into a classification status. In your example, it would serve to find out whether your drawing represents the sun. This falls under the binary classification model  yes or no, 1 or 0 .  [ 188 ]   Getting Your Neurons to Work  Chapter 9  Notice that the size of the outputs diminishes progressively until the outputs reach 1, the binary classification status that will return  1 or 0 . These successive steps, or layers, represent what you did when you went from observing the sun to drawing it. In the end, if we draw poorly and nobody recognizes the sun, it means that we have to go back to step 1 and change some parameters  weights in this case . That way, we train to represent the sun better until somebody says, "Yes, it is a sun!" That is probability = 1. Another person may say that it is not a sun  probability = 0; thus, more training would be required .  If you carry out this experiment of drawing the sun, you will notice that, as a human, you transform one area at a time with your eye and pencil. You repeat the way you do it in each area. That mathematical repetition you perform is your kernel. Using a kernel per area is the fastest way to draw. For us humans, in fact, it is the only way we can draw. A CNN is based on this process.  This section describes each component of this model. Hundreds of different models can be implemented. However, once you understand one model, you can implement the many others.

[ 189 ]   Getting Your Neurons to Work  Chapter 9  Adding a 2D convolution  In the example of a drawing  image , we used our inbuilt human spacial module, working on a two-dimensional piece of paper with  x, y  coordinates. Two-dimensional relationships can be real-life images and also many other objects as described in this chapter. This chapter describes a two-dimensional network, although others exist:  A one-dimensional CNN mostly describes a temporal mode, for example, a sequence of sounds  phonemes = parts of words , words, numbers and any other type of sequence A volumetric module is a 3D convolution, such as recognizing a cube or a video  In this chapter, a spatial 2D convolution module will be applied to images of different kinds. The main program,  cid:36  cid:47  cid:47  cid:64  cid:52  cid:53  cid:51  cid:34  cid:53  cid:38  cid:40  cid:58  cid:64  cid:46  cid:48  cid:37  cid:38  cid:45  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90 , will describe how to build and save a model.   cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:74  cid:70  cid:83  cid:16  cid:66  cid:69  cid:69  will add a layer to the model. The name classifier does not represent a function but simply the arbitrary name that was given to this model in this particular program. The model will end up with n layers. Look at the following line of code:   cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:74  cid:70  cid:83  cid:16  cid:66  cid:69  cid:69  cid:10  cid:36  cid:80  cid:79  cid:87  cid:20  cid:37  cid:10  cid:21  cid:20  cid:14  cid:2  cid:10  cid:21  cid:14  cid:2  cid:21  cid:11  cid:14  cid:74  cid:79  cid:81  cid:86  cid:85  cid:64  cid:84  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:70  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:10  cid:24  cid:22  cid:14  cid:2  cid:24  cid:22  cid:14  cid:2  cid:21  cid:11  cid:14  cid:2  cid:66  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:87  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:31   cid:9  cid:83  cid:70  cid:77  cid:86  cid:9  cid:11  cid:11   This line of code contains a lot of information: the filters  applied with kernels , the input shape, and an activation function. The function contains many more options. Once you understand these in depth, you can implement other options one by one, as you deem necessary, for each project you have to work on.  Kernel Just to get started, intuitively let's take another everyday model. This model is a bit more mathematical and closer to CNN's kernel representation. Imagine a floor of very small square tiles in an office building. You would like each tile of the floor to be converted from dirty to clean, for example. You can imagine a cleaning machine converting 3 x 3 small tiles  pixels  at a time from dirty to clean. You would laugh if you saw somebody come with 50 cleaning machines to clean all of the 32 x 32 tiles  pixels  at the same time. You know it would consume more resources, intuitively. Not only is a kernel an efficient way to filter but also a kernel convolution is a time-saving resource process. The single cleaning machine is the kernel  dirty-to-clean filter , which will save you that time to perform the convolution  going over all of the tiles to clean, 3 x 3 area by 3 x 3 area  of transforming the floor from dirty to clean.  [ 190 ]   Getting Your Neurons to Work  Chapter 9  In this case, 32 different filters have been added with 3 x 3 sized kernels:   cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:74  cid:70  cid:83  cid:16  cid:66  cid:69  cid:69  cid:10  cid:36  cid:80  cid:79  cid:87  cid:20  cid:37  cid:10  cid:21  cid:20  cid:14  cid:2  cid:10  cid:21  cid:14  cid:2  cid:21  cid:11  cid:16  cid:16  cid:16   The use of kernels as filters is the core of a convolutional network.  32,  3,3   means  number of filters,  size of kernels  .   cid:42  cid:79  cid:85  cid:86  cid:74  cid:85  cid:74  cid:87  cid:70  cid:2  cid:66  cid:81  cid:81  cid:83  cid:80  cid:66  cid:68  cid:73  To understand a kernel intuitively, keep the sun and cleaning tiles examples in mind. In this section, a photograph of a cat will show how kernels work.  In a model analyzing cats, the initial photograph would look like this:  On the first run of this layer, even with no training, an untrained kernel will transform the photograph.  [ 191 ]   Getting Your Neurons to Work  Chapter 9  The first layer already has begun isolating the features of the cat. The edges have begun to appear: the cat's body, ears, nose, and eyes. In itself, this first filter  one of 32  with a size 3 x 3 kernel cid:100 in the first layer and with no training cid:100 already produces effective results.   Each subsequent layer will make the features stand out much better with smaller and smaller matrices and vectors until the program obtains a clear mathematical representation.   cid:37  cid:70  cid:87  cid:70  cid:77  cid:80  cid:81  cid:70  cid:83  cid:84  cid:9  cid:2  cid:66  cid:81  cid:81  cid:83  cid:80  cid:66  cid:68  cid:73  Developers like to see the result first to decide how to approach a problem.

But the values are preset, and not trained with weights. There is no learning here; only a matrix needs to be applied. The major difference with a CNN network is that it will learn how to optimize kernels itself through weights and biases.   cid:74  cid:78  cid:81  cid:16  cid:67  cid:78  cid:81  is loaded, and the 3 x 3 matrix is applied to the pixels of the loaded image, area by area:   cid:5  cid:42  cid:42  cid:16  cid:45  cid:80  cid:66  cid:69  cid:2  cid:74  cid:78  cid:66  cid:72  cid:70  cid:2  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:2  cid:68  cid:80  cid:79  cid:87  cid:80  cid:77  cid:86  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79   cid:74  cid:78  cid:66  cid:72  cid:70  cid:31  cid:78  cid:81  cid:74  cid:78  cid:72  cid:16  cid:74  cid:78  cid:83  cid:70  cid:66  cid:69  cid:10  cid:9  cid:74  cid:78  cid:72  cid:16  cid:67  cid:78  cid:81  cid:9  cid:11  cid:60  cid:28  cid:14  cid:28  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62   cid:84  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:70  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:74  cid:78  cid:66  cid:72  cid:70  cid:16  cid:84  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:70   The image before the convolution applying the kernel is the letter A  letter recognition :  Now the convolution transforms the image, as shown in the following code:   cid:5  cid:42  cid:42  cid:42  cid:16  cid:36  cid:80  cid:79  cid:87  cid:80  cid:77  cid:86  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79   cid:74  cid:78  cid:66  cid:72  cid:70  cid:64  cid:66  cid:71  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:64  cid:76  cid:70  cid:83  cid:79  cid:70  cid:77  cid:2  cid:31   cid:71  cid:74  cid:77  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:16  cid:68  cid:80  cid:79  cid:87  cid:80  cid:77  cid:87  cid:70  cid:10  cid:74  cid:78  cid:66  cid:72  cid:70  cid:14  cid:76  cid:70  cid:83  cid:79  cid:70  cid:77  cid:64  cid:70  cid:69  cid:72  cid:70  cid:64  cid:69  cid:70  cid:85  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:14  cid:78  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:31  cid:9  cid:68  cid:80  cid:79  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:79  cid:85  cid:9  cid:14  cid:2  cid:68  cid:87  cid:66  cid:77  cid:31  cid:18  cid:11   [ 192 ]   Getting Your Neurons to Work  Chapter 9  The edges of A now appear clearly in white, as shown in the following graph:  The original image on top displayed a very thick A. In the preceding graph it displays a thin identifiable A feature through thin edges that a neural network can classify within a few mathematical operations. The first layers of a convolutional network train to find the right weights to generate the right kernel automatically.    cid:46  cid:66  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:78  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:68  cid:66  cid:77  cid:2  cid:66  cid:81  cid:81  cid:83  cid:80  cid:66  cid:68  cid:73  The initial image has a set of values you can display, as follows:   cid:5  cid:42  cid:42  cid:16  cid:45  cid:80  cid:66  cid:69  cid:2  cid:74  cid:78  cid:66  cid:72  cid:70   cid:74  cid:78  cid:66  cid:72  cid:70  cid:31  cid:78  cid:81  cid:74  cid:78  cid:72  cid:16  cid:74  cid:78  cid:83  cid:70  cid:66  cid:69  cid:10  cid:9  cid:74  cid:78  cid:72  cid:16  cid:67  cid:78  cid:81  cid:9  cid:11  cid:60  cid:28  cid:14  cid:28  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62   cid:84  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:70  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:74  cid:78  cid:66  cid:72  cid:70  cid:16  cid:84  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:70   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:4  cid:74  cid:78  cid:66  cid:72  cid:70  cid:2  cid:84  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:70  cid:4  cid:14  cid:84  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:70  cid:11   [ 193 ]   Getting Your Neurons to Work  Chapter 9  The code will print a numerical output of the image as follows:   cid:74  cid:78  cid:66  cid:72  cid:70  cid:2  cid:84  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:70  cid:2  cid:10  cid:19  cid:18  cid:18  cid:14  cid:2  cid:19  cid:18  cid:18  cid:11   cid:74  cid:78  cid:66  cid:72  cid:70  cid:2  cid:67  cid:70  cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:70  cid:2  cid:68  cid:80  cid:79  cid:87  cid:80  cid:77  cid:86  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79   cid:60  cid:60  cid:20  cid:23  cid:23  cid:2  cid:20  cid:23  cid:23  cid:2  cid:20  cid:23  cid:23  cid:2  cid:16  cid:16  cid:16  cid:14  cid:2  cid:20  cid:23  cid:23  cid:2  cid:20  cid:23  cid:23  cid:2  cid:20  cid:23  cid:23  cid:62   cid:2  cid:60  cid:20  cid:23  cid:23  cid:2  cid:20  cid:23  cid:23  cid:2  cid:20  cid:23  cid:23  cid:2  cid:16  cid:16  cid:16  cid:14  cid:2  cid:20  cid:23  cid:23  cid:2  cid:20  cid:23  cid:23  cid:2  cid:20  cid:23  cid:23  cid:62   cid:2  cid:60  cid:20  cid:23  cid:23  cid:2  cid:20  cid:23  cid:23  cid:2  cid:20  cid:23  cid:23  cid:2  cid:16  cid:16  cid:16  cid:14  cid:2  cid:20  cid:23  cid:23  cid:2  cid:20  cid:23  cid:23  cid:2  cid:20  cid:23  cid:23  cid:62   cid:2  cid:16  cid:16  cid:16  cid:14   The convolution filter is applied using  cid:71  cid:74  cid:77  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:16  cid:68  cid:80  cid:79  cid:87  cid:80  cid:77  cid:87  cid:70 , a mathematical function, to transform the image and filter it.  The convolution filter function uses several variables:  The spatial index for the 3 x 3 kernel to apply; in this case, it must know how to access the data. This is performed through a spatial index, j, which manages data in grids. Databases also use spatial indexes to access data. The axes of those grids determine the density of a spatial index. Kernels and the image are convolved using j over W, the weights kernel. W is the weights kernel. I is the input image. k is the coordinate of the center of W. The default value is 0 in this case.  These variables then enter the  cid:71  cid:74  cid:77  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:16  cid:68  cid:80  cid:79  cid:87  cid:80  cid:77  cid:87  cid:70  function as represented by the following equation:  A CNN relies on kernels. Take all the time you need to explore convolutions through the three dimensions required to master AI: intuitive approach, development testing, and mathematical representation.  Shape Shape defines the size of the image, which is 64 x 64 pixels  height x width , as shown here.   cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:74  cid:70  cid:83  cid:16  cid:66  cid:69  cid:69  cid:10  cid:16  cid:16  cid:16  cid:74  cid:79  cid:81  cid:86  cid:85  cid:64  cid:84  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:70  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:10  cid:24  cid:22  cid:14  cid:2  cid:24  cid:22  cid:14  cid:2  cid:21  cid:11  cid:16  cid:16  cid:16  cid:11    cid:21  indicates the number of channels. In this case,  cid:21  indicates the three parameters of an RGB color. Each number can have a given value of 0 to 255.  [ 194 ]   Getting Your Neurons to Work  Chapter 9  ReLu Activation functions provide useful ways to influence the transformation of the input data weight bias calculations. Their output will change the course of a classification, a prediction, or whatever goal the network was built for. This model applies rectified linear unit  ReLU , as shown in the following code:   cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:74  cid:70  cid:83  cid:16  cid:66  cid:69  cid:69  cid:10  cid:16  cid:16  cid:16  cid:14  cid:2  cid:66  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:87  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:9  cid:83  cid:70  cid:77  cid:86  cid:9  cid:11  cid:11   ReLU activation functions apply variations of the following function to an input value:  f x  = max{0, x}   The function returns 0 for negative values; it returns the positive values as x; it returns 0 for 0 values.  ReLU appears to be easier to optimize. Half of the domain of the function will return zeros. This means that when you provide positive values, the derivative will always be 1. This avoids the squashing effect of the logistic sigmoid function, for example. However, the decision to use one activation function rather than another will depend on the goal of each ANN model.  In mathematical terms, a rectified linear unit function will take all the negative values and apply 0 to them. And all the positive values remain unchanged.  The  cid:51  cid:70  cid:45  cid:86  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  program provides some functions including a NumPy function to test how ReLu works.  You can enter test values or use the ones in the source code:   cid:74  cid:78  cid:81  cid:80  cid:83  cid:85  cid:2  cid:79  cid:86  cid:78  cid:81  cid:90  cid:2  cid:66  cid:84  cid:2  cid:79  cid:81   cid:79  cid:89  cid:31  cid:15  cid:21   cid:81  cid:89  cid:31  cid:19    cid:79  cid:89  expects a negative value and  cid:81  cid:89  expects a positive value for testing purposes for the  cid:83  cid:70  cid:77  cid:86  cid:10  cid:89  cid:11  and  cid:77  cid:83  cid:70  cid:77  cid:86  cid:10  cid:89  cid:11  functions. Use the  cid:71  cid:10  cid:89  cid:11  function if you wish to include zeros in your testing session.  [ 195 ]   Getting Your Neurons to Work  Chapter 9  The  cid:83  cid:70  cid:77  cid:86  cid:10  cid:89  cid:11  function will calculate the ReLU value:   cid:69  cid:70  cid:71  cid:2  cid:83  cid:70  cid:77  cid:86  cid:10  cid:89  cid:11  cid:28   cid:74  cid:71  cid:10  cid:89  cid:30  cid:18  cid:11  cid:28  cid:51  cid:70  cid:45  cid:54  cid:31  cid:18   cid:74  cid:71  cid:10  cid:89  cid:32  cid:18  cid:11  cid:28  cid:51  cid:70  cid:45  cid:54  cid:31  cid:19   cid:83  cid:70  cid:85  cid:86  cid:83  cid:79  cid:2  cid:51  cid:70  cid:45  cid:54   In this case, the program will return the following result:   cid:79  cid:70  cid:72  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:87  cid:70  cid:2  cid:89  cid:31  cid:2  cid:15  cid:21  cid:2  cid:81  cid:80  cid:84  cid:74  cid:85  cid:74  cid:87  cid:70  cid:2  cid:89  cid:31  cid:2  cid:23   cid:51  cid:70  cid:45  cid:54  cid:2  cid:79  cid:89  cid:31  cid:2  cid:18   cid:51  cid:70  cid:45  cid:54  cid:2  cid:81  cid:89  cid:31  cid:2  cid:23   The result of a negative value becomes 0, and the positive value remains unchanged. The derivative or slope is thus always one, which is practical in many cases and provides good visibility when debugging a CNN or any other ANN.  The NumPy function defined as follows will provide the same results.   cid:69  cid:70  cid:71  cid:2  cid:71  cid:10  cid:89  cid:11  cid:28   cid:2  cid:87  cid:71  cid:89  cid:31  cid:79  cid:81  cid:16  cid:78  cid:66  cid:89  cid:74  cid:78  cid:86  cid:78  cid:10  cid:18  cid:14  cid:89  cid:11   cid:2  cid:83  cid:70  cid:85  cid:86  cid:83  cid:79  cid:2  cid:87  cid:71  cid:89   Through trial and error, ANN research has come up with several variations of ReLU.  One important example occurs when many input values are negative. ReLu will constantly produce zeros, making gradient descent difficult if not impossible.   A clever solution was found using a leaky ReLU. A leaky ReLU does not return a zero for a negative value but a small value you can choose, 0.1 instead of 0, for example. See the following equation:  f x  = max{0.1, x}  Now gradient descent will work fine.

Max pooling consists of applying a max pooling window to a layer of the image:   cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:74  cid:70  cid:83  cid:16  cid:66  cid:69  cid:69  cid:10  cid:46  cid:66  cid:89  cid:49  cid:80  cid:80  cid:77  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:20  cid:37  cid:10  cid:81  cid:80  cid:80  cid:77  cid:64  cid:84  cid:74  cid:91  cid:70  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:10  cid:20  cid:14  cid:2  cid:20  cid:11  cid:11  cid:11   This  cid:81  cid:80  cid:80  cid:77  cid:64  cid:84  cid:74  cid:91  cid:70  2 x 2 window will first find the maximum value of the 2 x 2 matrix on the top left of the image matrix. This first maximum value is 4. It is thus the first value of the pooling window on the right.   Then the max pooling window hops over two squares and finds that 5 is the highest value. 5 is written in the max pooling window. The hop action is called a stride. A stride value of 2 will avoid overlapping although some CNN models have strides that overlap. It all depends on your goal. Look at the following diagram:  [ 197 ]   Getting Your Neurons to Work  Chapter 9  The output size has now gone from a 62 x 62 x 32  number of filters  to a 31 x 31 x 32, as shown in the following diagram:  Other pooling methods exist, such as average pooling, which will use the average of the pooling window and not the maximum value. This depends on the model and shows the hard work to put in to train a model.  Next convolution and pooling layer The next two layers of the CNN repeat the same method as the first two described previously, and it is implemented as follows in the source code:   cid:5  cid:2  cid:34  cid:69  cid:69  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:66  cid:2  cid:84  cid:70  cid:68  cid:80  cid:79  cid:69  cid:2  cid:68  cid:80  cid:79  cid:87  cid:80  cid:77  cid:86  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:66  cid:77  cid:2  cid:77  cid:66  cid:90  cid:70  cid:83   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:4  cid:52  cid:85  cid:70  cid:81  cid:2  cid:21  cid:66  cid:2  cid:36  cid:80  cid:79  cid:87  cid:80  cid:77  cid:86  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:4  cid:11   cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:74  cid:70  cid:83  cid:16  cid:66  cid:69  cid:69  cid:10  cid:36  cid:80  cid:79  cid:87  cid:20  cid:37  cid:10  cid:21  cid:20  cid:14  cid:2  cid:10  cid:21  cid:14  cid:2  cid:21  cid:11  cid:14  cid:2  cid:66  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:87  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:9  cid:83  cid:70  cid:77  cid:86  cid:9  cid:11  cid:11   cid:74  cid:78  cid:81  cid:31  cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:74  cid:70  cid:83  cid:16  cid:74  cid:79  cid:81  cid:86  cid:85   cid:80  cid:86  cid:85  cid:81  cid:86  cid:85  cid:84  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:60  cid:77  cid:66  cid:90  cid:70  cid:83  cid:16  cid:80  cid:86  cid:85  cid:81  cid:86  cid:85  cid:2  cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:77  cid:66  cid:90  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:74  cid:70  cid:83  cid:16  cid:77  cid:66  cid:90  cid:70  cid:83  cid:84  cid:62    cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:4  cid:52  cid:85  cid:70  cid:81  cid:2  cid:21  cid:67  cid:2  cid:49  cid:80  cid:80  cid:77  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:4  cid:11   cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:74  cid:70  cid:83  cid:16  cid:66  cid:69  cid:69  cid:10  cid:46  cid:66  cid:89  cid:49  cid:80  cid:80  cid:77  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:20  cid:37  cid:10  cid:81  cid:80  cid:80  cid:77  cid:64  cid:84  cid:74  cid:91  cid:70  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:10  cid:20  cid:14  cid:2  cid:20  cid:11  cid:11  cid:11   These two layers have drastically downsized the input to 14 x 14 x 32, as shown in this diagram:   The next layer can now flatten the output.  [ 198 ]   Getting Your Neurons to Work  Chapter 9  Flattening The flattening layer takes the output of the max pooling layer and transforms into a vector of size x * y * z in the following code:   cid:5  cid:2  cid:52  cid:85  cid:70  cid:81  cid:2  cid:22  cid:2  cid:15  cid:2  cid:39  cid:77  cid:66  cid:85  cid:85  cid:70  cid:79  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:4  cid:52  cid:85  cid:70  cid:81  cid:2  cid:22  cid:2  cid:39  cid:77  cid:66  cid:85  cid:85  cid:70  cid:79  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:4  cid:11   cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:74  cid:70  cid:83  cid:16  cid:66  cid:69  cid:69  cid:10  cid:39  cid:77  cid:66  cid:85  cid:85  cid:70  cid:79  cid:10  cid:11  cid:11   In this case, the layer vector will be 14 x 14 x 32 = 6,272, as shown in the following diagram:  This operation creates a standard layer with 6,272 very practical connections for the dense operations that follow. After flattening has been carried out, a fully connected, dense network can be implemented.  Dense layers Dense layers are fully connected. This has been made possible by the reductions in size calculated up to here, as shown before.  The successive layers in this sequential model have brought the size of the image down enough to use dense layers to finish the job. Dense 1 comes first, as shown here:  [ 199 ]   Getting Your Neurons to Work  Chapter 9  The flattening layer produced 14 x 14 x 32 size 6,272 layer with a weight for each input. If it had not gone through the previous layers, the flattening would have produced a much larger layer, and the features would not have been extracted by the filters. The result would produce nothing effective.  With the main features extracted by the filters through successive layers and size reduction, the dense operations will lead directly to a prediction using the ReLu on the dense 1 operation and the logistic sigmoid function on the dense operation.  Dense activation functions This is how to apply the ReLU activation function.  The domain of the ReLU activation function is applied to the result of the first dense operation. The ReLU activation function will output the initial input for values >=0 and will output 0 for values <0:  f input value  = max{0, input_value    This is how to apply the logistic sigmoid activation function.  The logistic activation function applied to the second dense operation, as described in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:20 , Think like a Machine, will produce a value between 0 and 1:  LS x ={0,1}  We will now discuss the last dense layer after the LS activation function.  The last dense layer is size 1 and will classify the initial input, an image in this case:  The layers of the model have now been added. Training can begin.  [ 200 ]   Getting Your Neurons to Work  Chapter 9  Training a CNN model Training a CNN model involves four phases: compiling the model, loading the training data, loading the test data, and running the model through epochs of loss evaluation and parameter-updating cycles.  In this section, the choice of the theme of the training dataset will be a real-life case study from the food-processing industry.  The goal The primary goal of this model consists of detecting production efficiency flaws on a food- processing conveyor belt. The use of CIFAR-10  images  and MNIST  handwritten digit base  proves useful to understand and train some models  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:18 , Applying Biomimicking to Artificial Intelligence . However, at one point, real-life datasets must be used to sell and implement deep learning and artificial intelligence in general.  The following photograph shows a section of the conveyor belt that contains an acceptable level of products, in this case, portions of chocolate cakes:  However, sometimes the production slows down, and the output goes down to an alert level, as shown in the following photograph:  The alert-level image shows a gap that will slow down the packaging section of the factory dramatically.  [ 201 ]   Getting Your Neurons to Work  Chapter 9   cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:18 , Applying Biomimicking to Artificial Intelligence, describes how this model can apply to the food-processing industry and be transferred to other applications.   Compiling the model Compiling a Keras model requires a minimum of two options: a loss function and an optimizer. You evaluate how much you are losing and then optimize your parameters, just as in real life. A metric option has been added to measure the performance of the model. With a metric, you can analyze your losses and optimize your situation, as shown in the following code:   cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:74  cid:70  cid:83  cid:16  cid:68  cid:80  cid:78  cid:81  cid:74  cid:77  cid:70  cid:10  cid:80  cid:81  cid:85  cid:74  cid:78  cid:74  cid:91  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:9  cid:66  cid:69  cid:66  cid:78  cid:9  cid:14  cid:2  cid:77  cid:80  cid:84  cid:84  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:9  cid:67  cid:74  cid:79  cid:66  cid:83  cid:90  cid:64  cid:68  cid:83  cid:80  cid:84  cid:84  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:83  cid:80  cid:81  cid:90  cid:9  cid:14   cid:78  cid:70  cid:85  cid:83  cid:74  cid:68  cid:84  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:60  cid:9  cid:66  cid:68  cid:68  cid:86  cid:83  cid:66  cid:68  cid:90  cid:9  cid:62  cid:11   Loss function The loss function provides information on how far the state of the model y1  weights, biases  is from its target state y.  A description of the quadratic loss function precedes that of the binary cross-entropy functions applied to the case study model in this chapter.   cid:50  cid:86  cid:66  cid:69  cid:83  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:68  cid:2  cid:77  cid:80  cid:84  cid:84  cid:2  cid:71  cid:86  cid:79  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  For gradient descent, see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:23 , Manage the Power of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Let us refresh the concept. Imagine you are on a hill and want to walk down that hill. Your goal is to get to y, the bottom of the hill. Presently you are at a. Google Maps shows you that you still have to go a certain distance:  That formula is great for the moment. But now suppose you are almost at the bottom of the hill, and the person walking in front of you dropped a coin. You have to slow down now, and Google Maps is not helping much because it doesn't display such small distances that well. You open an imaginary application called tiny maps that zooms into small distances with a quadratic objective  or cost  function:  [ 202 ]   Getting Your Neurons to Work  Chapter 9  To make it more comfortable to analyze, O is divided by 2, producing a standard quadratic cost function:  y is the goal. a is the result of the operation of applying the weights, biases, and finally the activation functions.  With the derivatives of the results, the weights and biases can be updated. In our hill example, if you move one meter  y  per step  x , that is much more than moving 0.5 meters  y  per step. Depending on your position on the hill, you can see that you cannot apply a constant learning rate  conceptually the length of your step ; you adapt it just like Adam, the optimizer, does.   cid:35  cid:74  cid:79  cid:66  cid:83  cid:90  cid:2  cid:68  cid:83  cid:80  cid:84  cid:84  cid:15  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:83  cid:80  cid:81  cid:90  Cross-entropy comes in handy when the learning slows down. In the hill example, it slowed down at the bottom. But, remember, a path can lead you sideways, meaning you are momentarily stuck at a given height. Cross-entropy solves that by being able to function well with very small values  steps on the hill .  Suppose you have the following structure:  Inputs is {x1, x2, ..., xn} Weights is {w1, w2, ..., wn} A bias  or sometimes more  is b An activation function ReLU, logistic sigmoid, or other   Before the activation, z represents the sum of the classical operations:.  Now the activation function is applied to z to obtain the present output of the model.  [ 203 ]   Getting Your Neurons to Work  Chapter 9  With this in mind, the cross-entropy loss formula can be explained:  In this function:  n is the total number of items of the input training, with multiclass data. M > 2 means situations in which a separate loss of each class label is calculated. The choice of the logarithm base  2, e, 10  will produce different effects. y is the output goal. y1 is the present value, as described previously.  This loss function is always positive; the values have a minus sign in front of them, and the function starts with a minus. The output produces small numbers that tend to zero as the system progresses.  The loss function in Keras, which uses TensorFlow, uses this basic concept with more mathematical inputs to update the parameters.  A binary cross-entropy loss function is a binomial function that will produce a probability output of 0 or 1 and not a value between 0 and 1 as in standard cross-entropy. In the binomial classification model, the output will be 0 or 1.   In this case, the sum  entropy loss function is then as follows:   is not necessary when M  number of classes  = 2. The binary cross-  The whole concept of this loss function method is for the CNN network to be used in specific real-life case studies described in the training dataset section and  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:18 , Applying Biomimicking to Artificial Intelligence.  Adam optimizer In the hill example, you first walked with big strides down the hill using momentum  larger strides because you are going in the right direction . Then you had to take smaller steps to find the object. You are adapting your estimation of your moment to your need; hence, the name adaptive moment estimation  Adam .  [ 204 ]   Getting Your Neurons to Work  Chapter 9  Adam constantly compares the mean past gradients to present gradients. In the hill example, it compares how fast you were going.  The Adam optimizer represents an alternative to the classical gradient descent method or stochastic gradient descent method  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:23 , Manage the Power of Machine Learning and Deep Learning . Adam goes further by applying its optimizer to random  stochastic  mini-batches of the dataset. This makes it a version of stochastic gradient descent.  Then, with even more inventiveness, Adam adds root-mean-square deviation  RMSprop  to the process by applying per-parameter learning weights. It analyzes how fast the means of the weights are changing  such as the gradients in our hill slope example  and adapts the learning weights.  Metrics Metrics are there to measure the performance of your model. The metric function behaves like a loss function. However, it is not used to train the model.  In this case, the accuracy parameter was this:   cid:16  cid:16  cid:16  cid:78  cid:70  cid:85  cid:83  cid:74  cid:68  cid:84  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:60  cid:9  cid:66  cid:68  cid:68  cid:86  cid:83  cid:66  cid:68  cid:90  cid:9  cid:62  cid:11   Here, a value that descends towards 0 shows whether the training is on the right track and moves up to one when the training requires Adam function optimizing to set the training on track again.  Training dataset The training dataset is available on GitHub, along with the installation instructions and explanations. The dataset contains the photo shown previously for the food-processing conveyor belt example.  The class A directory contains the acceptable level images of a production line that is producing acceptable levels of products. The class B directory contains the alert-level images of a production line that is producing unacceptable levels of products.  The number of images of the dataset is limited because of the following:  For the purpose of training this limited industrial model, the images produced good results The training-testing phase runs faster to study the program  [ 205 ]   Getting Your Neurons to Work  Chapter 9  The goal of the model is to detect the alert levels as described in more detail in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:18 , Applying Biomimicking to Artificial Intelligence, when it will be applied to the trained images and generalized to similar ones.  Data augmentation Data augmentation increases the size of the dataset by generating distorted versions of the images provided.

In this case, binary returns 1D binary labels.   Testing dataset The testing dataset flow follows the same structure as the training dataset flow described previously. However, for testing purposes, the task can be made easier or more difficult depending on the choice of the model. This can be done by adding images with defects or noise. This will force the system into more training and the project team into more hard work to fine-tune the model. Data augmentation provides an efficient way of producing distorted images without adding images to the dataset. Both methods, among many others, can be applied at the same time when necessary.  Data augmentation In this model, the data only goes through rescaling. Many other options could be added to complicate the training task to avoid overfitting, for example, or simply because the dataset is small:   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:4  cid:52  cid:85  cid:70  cid:81  cid:2  cid:26  cid:66  cid:2  cid:85  cid:70  cid:84  cid:85  cid:4  cid:11   cid:85  cid:70  cid:84  cid:85  cid:64  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:72  cid:70  cid:79  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:42  cid:78  cid:66  cid:72  cid:70  cid:37  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:40  cid:70  cid:79  cid:70  cid:83  cid:66  cid:85  cid:80  cid:83  cid:10  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:68  cid:66  cid:77  cid:70  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:19  cid:16  cid:17  cid:20  cid:23  cid:23  cid:11   [ 207 ]   Getting Your Neurons to Work  Chapter 9  Loading the data Loading the testing data remains limited to what is necessary for this model.

Summary Building and training a CNN will only succeed with hard work at choosing the model, the right dataset, and hyperparameters. Convolutions, pooling, flattening, dense layers, activations, and optimizing parameters  weights and biases  form solid building blocks to train and use a model.  Training a CNN to solve an everyday industrial problem helps sell AI to a manager or a sales prospect. In this case, using the model to help a food-processing factory solve a conveyor belt productivity problem takes artificial intelligence a step further into everyday corporate life.  Saving the model provides a practical way to use it by loading it and applying it to new images to classify them.

In the 1940s, McCulloch and Pitts  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:20 , Think like a Machine  came up with a human neuron. Then Rosenblatt came up with a human perceptron   cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:22 , Become an Unconventional Innovator . Mimicking humans seemed to have conquered the world of artificial intelligence networks. Then, in 1969, Minsky slowed research down by proving that a perceptron could not solve the XOR problem  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83   cid:22 , Become an Unconventional Innovator .  Today, deep learning networks reproduce our mental way of thinking. Neuroscientists now work on representing our physical brain functions. These two different fields, though different, still inspire each other.  Neural networks provide good mathematical models of how our mind works on the number side. Mental images on top of words and numbers to describe them constitute the larger part of human thinking. As shown in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:26 , Revolutions Designed for Some Corporations and Disruptive Innovations Small to Large Companies, the uncharted territory of AI must be continuously explored. Our community needs to make progress in this direction with tools that will represent our way of thinking at higher levels.  The following topics will be covered in this chapter:  Showing how a neural network mimics the way a human mind represents images Showing how to use the graph structure representation of deep learning neural networks to build and debug them Exploring how the mathematical model neural networks are built today with TensorBoard   Applying Biomimicking to Artificial Intelligence  Chapter 10  Understanding the cutting edge of the mathematical data flow graph structures such as TensorFlow, which will lead us to the cutting edge of biomimicking humans with these methods The difference between neuroscience computing models and deep learning models A TensorFlow MNIST classifier TensorBoard dashboards TensorFlow scopes, placeholders, variables, and other components Analyzing accuracy, cross-entropy, and weights during the training process  This chapter prepares the reader for  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:19 , Conceptual Representation Learning, which goes right over the cutting edge and into the uncharted territory of conceptual representation learning  CRL  and meta networks.

TensorBoard. With TensorFlow, our representation of image recognition in a mathematical graph data flow structure has become an extremely efficient model. TensorBoard provides a visual representation of what we are building.  TensorFlow represents how our mind recognizes images  and other elements . TensorBoard enables our minds to visualize that representation and improve it.  TensorFlow, an open source machine learning framework TensorFlow relies on graph representations of data flow. The graph computes dependencies between operations.  When using Keras, as in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:27 , Getting Your Neurons to Work, the details of graphs and sessions do not appear. However, to compare our brain with deep learning, some details need to be examined using  cid:40  cid:80  cid:80  cid:72  cid:77  cid:70  cid:64  cid:53  cid:70  cid:79  cid:84  cid:80  cid:83  cid:64  cid:36  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:74  cid:70  cid:83  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90 , which classifies MNIST handwritten images and saves the summaries  information about the model .  [ 214 ]   Applying Biomimicking to Artificial Intelligence  Chapter 10  The graph of the program is as shown in the following diagram:  The nodes  labels with lines around them  and edges  lines connecting the labels  constitute the graph structure. The graph structure, in turn, indicates how the operations are connected to one another.   cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:27 , Getting Your Neurons to Work, described all the nodes except dropout. In that chapter, two dense layers were added to the classifier model. Sometimes, when constructing a dense layer, some elements will not be trained. This is done to avoid overfitting  see the transfer learning section later , which means that the model will know the training set too well and will not adapt efficiently to new objects  images, sounds, or words . This method, among others, helps to fine-tune the model during the regularization process  methods to avoid overfitting, for example . The dropout regularization rate can be added to the graph structure. Dropouts can be used several times and at different places in a given model.   [ 215 ]   Applying Biomimicking to Artificial Intelligence  Chapter 10  Does deep learning represent our brain or our mind? After reading  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:27 , Getting Your Neurons to Work, and the beginning of this chapter, it takes a major effort to see how a data flow graph structure representing a deep learning model has something to do with our brain.  We have gone a long way since the McCulloch-Pitts neuron proudly tried to represent a neuron in our brain  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:20 , Think like a Machine .  Neuroscience research that tries to create computer models of our brain is now named computational neuroscience. Computer systems represent mathematical models of the brain. Understanding how the brain works remains a critical field of physiology, nervous system, cognitive ability, and related research. It sometimes provides some ideas for deep learning networks.  But a TensorFlow data flow graph structure represents a deep learning model  or other models  of a mathematical solution to a classification or prediction problem.  Deep learning networks have moved away from neuroscience, and their source of inspiration comes mostly from other areas such as applied mathematics  linear algebra , probability, information theory  for entropy, for example , and other related fields.  Naturally, the media hype surrounding artificial intelligence seems a bit confusing because marketing managers make some impressive demonstrations of robots that look like us, try to act like us, and speak like us. No matter what those systems do right now, their learning model relies on data flow graph structures based mostly on mathematical representations of our mind, not our brain.  Our mind thinks and reasons. When we think, we do not feel our brain following through neurons and synapses. Our mind acts like a high-level API between what we want to do and what our brain does for us.   To improve our API, we create abstract representations of almost everything around us. We try to make sense of the chaos of all the incoming perceptions and thoughts we have to manage. The better our representations, the more efficient our API to our brain will become.  The TensorFlow data flow graph structure represents our mind's API relaying information seamlessly to our brain, not our brain structure which we cannot see when we think.  In the end, a deep learning network is a way of mimicking humans.  [ 216 ]   Applying Biomimicking to Artificial Intelligence  Chapter 10  Biomimicking in deep learning simply mimics a deep learning network and imitates our mathematical mind.  A TensorBoard representation of our mind Nobody is sure how our brains can learn quickly with a few labeled objects and then apply the patterns to unsupervised, unlabeled learning. Research on the subject will eventually produce some helpful explanations.   In the meantime, we must rely on our mind's representations to train deep learning models.

The following sections focus on TensorFlow objects that are not always perceived with high-level interfaces, such as Keras.  Input data This program is a unit-testing model. It uses unit-testing data in a unit-testing deep learning model:   cid:78  cid:79  cid:74  cid:84  cid:85  cid:2  cid:31   cid:74  cid:79  cid:81  cid:86  cid:85  cid:64  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:16  cid:83  cid:70  cid:66  cid:69  cid:64  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:64  cid:84  cid:70  cid:85  cid:84  cid:10  cid:39  cid:45  cid:34  cid:40  cid:52  cid:16  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:64  cid:69  cid:74  cid:83  cid:14  cid:80  cid:79  cid:70  cid:64  cid:73  cid:80  cid:85  cid:31  cid:53  cid:83  cid:86  cid:70  cid:14  cid:71  cid:66  cid:76  cid:70  cid:64  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:31  cid:39  cid:45  cid:34  cid:40  cid:52  cid:16  cid:71  cid:66  cid:76  cid:70  cid:64   cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:11    cid:71  cid:66  cid:76  cid:70  cid:64  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  refers to an MNIST  handwritten digits  unit testing dataset and  cid:39  cid:45  cid:34  cid:40  cid:52  are command-line parameters  in this case, path information .   cid:80  cid:79  cid:70  cid:15  cid:73  cid:80  cid:85  cid:31  cid:85  cid:83  cid:86  cid:70  means that the labels of the data must be encoded into values. The presence of labels means that this is a supervised  with labels  training classifier and not an unsupervised  training with no labels  classifier.

Layer 1  cid:97  managing the inputs to the network As with the Keras, implementing a layer in TensorFlow is done in a few lines but with TensorBoard. Layer 1 takes  cid:89  cid:15  cid:74  cid:79  cid:81  cid:86  cid:85 , calculates a weight, applies an activation function and sends its output directly to the training node and also to the dropout node.

However, when a system fails and we have to debug it, having a peek at the preactivation function sometimes provides effective clues on what is going wrong. To visualize the preactivation output shown in the following graph, click on Wx_plus_b in layer 1, which shows that many events are influencing the training process:  Several notable operations occur with  cid:56  cid:89  cid:64  cid:81  cid:77  cid:86  cid:84  cid:64  cid:67 :  The weights and biases are connected to the training process, which is continuously modifying them; this happens even before the  cid:46  cid:66  cid:85  cid:46  cid:86  cid:77  operation. Several tensors are sent to the training node and  cid:46  cid:66  cid:85  cid:78  cid:86  cid:77 . The  cid:46  cid:66  cid:85  cid:78  cid:86  cid:77  operation carries out the multiplications  Wx . But its output sends information to the training node and produces an output for the  cid:66  cid:69  cid:69  node. The  cid:66  cid:69  cid:69  node itself sends its output to the activation function and also to the preactivation data to the histogram summary so that we can analyze the behavior of this hidden layer.   [ 223 ]   Applying Biomimicking to Artificial Intelligence  Chapter 10  Now when we click on the HISTOGRAMS section on TensorBoard, we can visualize the evolution of weight and bias training in the following diagrams:  In this model, the preactivation diagrams show a smooth Gaussian-like bell  peak in the middle and similar slopes on each side . When building a model, everything seems fine. But if the curves become erratic and training the model fails, these histograms will provide critical information.   You can zoom in and check the values if necessary as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 224 ]   Applying Biomimicking to Artificial Intelligence  Chapter 10  TensorBoard makes hidden layer intermediate values visible, which enhances our mental representation of a model.  In a real-life project, if the activation node goes wrong, checking the preactivation status of the layer eliminates a possible cause of design errors.   cid:53  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:66  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:87  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:71  cid:86  cid:79  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:80  cid:71  cid:2  cid:45  cid:66  cid:90  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  The activation function of this model the is ReLU function  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:27 , Getting Your Neurons to Work .  When we peek into its structure, once again we see that it is not just an activation function in a sequential process. Its output goes to the dropout and training nodes with complex intermediate calculations as shown in the following description of the activation function:  TensorBoard provides us with yet another visual representation to control the distribution of preactivation and, in this case, activations. The DISTRIBUTIONS section enables us to detect anomalies in the activation phase once we have verified that the preactivation functions produce acceptable results.  [ 225 ]   Applying Biomimicking to Artificial Intelligence  Chapter 10  The visual representation of the complex node and edge structure of a TensorFlow data flow graph come in handy when design errors slow a project down.  Dropout and Layer 2 Dropouts and the designing of a layer were explained previously.  However, let us focus on some features of the dropout node: dropout keep probability and the outputs in the following diagram.  A dropout keep probability plays an overfitting reduction role. The probability leads to dropping neurons during the training process. The scaling is done automatically. Furthermore, this dropout feature is turned on and off during testing:   cid:88  cid:74  cid:85  cid:73  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:79  cid:66  cid:78  cid:70  cid:64  cid:84  cid:68  cid:80  cid:81  cid:70  cid:10  cid:9  cid:69  cid:83  cid:80  cid:81  cid:80  cid:86  cid:85  cid:9  cid:11  cid:28   cid:76  cid:70  cid:70  cid:81  cid:64  cid:81  cid:83  cid:80  cid:67  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:81  cid:77  cid:66  cid:68  cid:70  cid:73  cid:80  cid:77  cid:69  cid:70  cid:83  cid:10  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:71  cid:77  cid:80  cid:66  cid:85  cid:21  cid:20  cid:11   cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:84  cid:86  cid:78  cid:78  cid:66  cid:83  cid:90  cid:16  cid:84  cid:68  cid:66  cid:77  cid:66  cid:83  cid:10  cid:9  cid:69  cid:83  cid:80  cid:81  cid:80  cid:86  cid:85  cid:64  cid:76  cid:70  cid:70  cid:81  cid:64  cid:81  cid:83  cid:80  cid:67  cid:66  cid:67  cid:74  cid:77  cid:74  cid:85  cid:90  cid:9  cid:14  cid:2  cid:76  cid:70  cid:70  cid:81  cid:64  cid:81  cid:83  cid:80  cid:67  cid:11   cid:69  cid:83  cid:80  cid:81  cid:81  cid:70  cid:69  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:79  cid:79  cid:16  cid:69  cid:83  cid:80  cid:81  cid:80  cid:86  cid:85  cid:10  cid:73  cid:74  cid:69  cid:69  cid:70  cid:79  cid:19  cid:14  cid:2  cid:76  cid:70  cid:70  cid:81  cid:64  cid:81  cid:83  cid:80  cid:67  cid:11   [ 226 ]   Applying Biomimicking to Artificial Intelligence  Chapter 10  TensorBoard receives the information through the  cid:84  cid:86  cid:78  cid:78  cid:66  cid:83  cid:90  cid:16  cid:84  cid:68  cid:66  cid:77  cid:66  cid:83  and can be viewed in the following SCALARS section:  Layer 2 The graph structure of layer 2 is the same as that of layer 1.  However, there are notable output differences in the connections  edges  to other nodes:  Layer 1 sends an output to the drop node and the layer 2 node Layer 2 now sends its output to the training node, the accuracy node, and the cross-entropy node as shown in TensorBoard  [ 227 ]   Applying Biomimicking to Artificial Intelligence  Chapter 10  Measuring the precision of prediction of a network through accuracy values The accuracy node contains two parts: correct prediction and accuracy. The output value is not sent to the training node but the correct predictions  see next section, Correct prediction  part of it is used by cross-entropy. Accuracy measures the performance of the system. You can stop training by limiting the number of epochs hyperparameter if you estimate that the accuracy is sufficient to achieve your goals. Or you can use accuracy to fine-tune the training model to increase its rate faster by modifying the hyperparameters or the design of your model.   cid:36  cid:80  cid:83  cid:83  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:2  cid:81  cid:83  cid:70  cid:69  cid:74  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  The following code implements  cid:68  cid:80  cid:83  cid:83  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:64  cid:81  cid:83  cid:70  cid:69  cid:74  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79 , which uses an  cid:66  cid:83  cid:72  cid:78  cid:66  cid:89  function.   cid:88  cid:74  cid:85  cid:73  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:79  cid:66  cid:78  cid:70  cid:64  cid:84  cid:68  cid:80  cid:81  cid:70  cid:10  cid:9  cid:66  cid:68  cid:68  cid:86  cid:83  cid:66  cid:68  cid:90  cid:9  cid:11  cid:28   cid:88  cid:74  cid:85  cid:73  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:79  cid:66  cid:78  cid:70  cid:64  cid:84  cid:68  cid:80  cid:81  cid:70  cid:10  cid:9  cid:68  cid:80  cid:83  cid:83  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:64  cid:81  cid:83  cid:70  cid:69  cid:74  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:9  cid:11  cid:28   cid:68  cid:80  cid:83  cid:83  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:64  cid:81  cid:83  cid:70  cid:69  cid:74  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:70  cid:82  cid:86  cid:66  cid:77  cid:10  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:66  cid:83  cid:72  cid:78  cid:66  cid:89  cid:10  cid:90  cid:14  cid:2  cid:19  cid:11  cid:14  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:66  cid:83  cid:72  cid:78  cid:66  cid:89  cid:10  cid:90  cid:64  cid:14  cid:2  cid:19  cid:11  cid:11    cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:66  cid:83  cid:72  cid:78  cid:66  cid:89  will output the index of the largest value of the input tensors. This simplifies the task considerably by avoiding the need to manage scores of values. When things go wrong cid:100 and they often do in real-life projects cid:100 we can go back to the preceding nodes and debug the data flow or improve the design of the data flow graph structure.  When accuracy fails to meet expectations, TensorBoard provides us with a two-dimensional debugging approach: fine-tune the data flow graph structure itself and also explore the data flow values that the node operations produce and send to other nodes through the edges.  [ 228 ]   Applying Biomimicking to Artificial Intelligence  Chapter 10  The following graph of the  cid:68  cid:80  cid:83  cid:83  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:64  cid:81  cid:83  cid:70  cid:69  cid:74  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  node has two inputs. The first one is the  cid:90  cid:15  cid:74  cid:79  cid:81  cid:86  cid:85 , which comes straight from the input node. The second input is the output of layer 2, which has processed the  cid:89  cid:15  cid:74  cid:79  cid:81  cid:86  cid:85  input that came from its preceding nodes and is communicating with the core training and cross-entropy nodes as well.   cid:66  cid:83  cid:72  cid:78  cid:66  cid:89  is applied separately to both inputs and sent to the accuracy node, and correct predictions are used by the cross-entropy node.   cid:66  cid:68  cid:68  cid:86  cid:83  cid:66  cid:68  cid:90  The  cid:66  cid:68  cid:68  cid:86  cid:83  cid:66  cid:68  cid:90  uses the output of the correct prediction to compute the mean of the elements of the tensor in the following code:   cid:88  cid:74  cid:85  cid:73  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:79  cid:66  cid:78  cid:70  cid:64  cid:84  cid:68  cid:80  cid:81  cid:70  cid:10  cid:9  cid:66  cid:68  cid:68  cid:86  cid:83  cid:66  cid:68  cid:90  cid:9  cid:11  cid:28   cid:66  cid:68  cid:68  cid:86  cid:83  cid:66  cid:68  cid:90  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:83  cid:70  cid:69  cid:86  cid:68  cid:70  cid:64  cid:78  cid:70  cid:66  cid:79  cid:10  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:68  cid:66  cid:84  cid:85  cid:10  cid:68  cid:80  cid:83  cid:83  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:64  cid:81  cid:83  cid:70  cid:69  cid:74  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:14  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:71  cid:77  cid:80  cid:66  cid:85  cid:21  cid:20  cid:11  cid:11   cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:84  cid:86  cid:78  cid:78  cid:66  cid:83  cid:90  cid:16  cid:84  cid:68  cid:66  cid:77  cid:66  cid:83  cid:10  cid:9  cid:66  cid:68  cid:68  cid:86  cid:83  cid:66  cid:68  cid:90  cid:9  cid:14  cid:2  cid:66  cid:68  cid:68  cid:86  cid:83  cid:66  cid:68  cid:90  cid:11    cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:83  cid:70  cid:69  cid:86  cid:68  cid:70  cid:16  cid:78  cid:70  cid:66  cid:79  calculates the mean in a standard way. For example, the mean of 2 and 4 is 3. Reducing the values of the input gives a good picture of how the model is doing during training without overloading the designer with too many values to analyze, as shown in the following diagram:  [ 229 ]   Applying Biomimicking to Artificial Intelligence  Chapter 10  The accuracy scalar is sent to  cid:66  cid:68  cid:68  cid:86  cid:83  cid:66  cid:68  cid:90 , which can be viewed in the following screenshot of the SCALARS section.  You will notice that the accuracy values go up and up until we almost reach a 1 top score value.   Take another good look. This rarely happens in real-life projects.   Accuracy fails to increase in many real-life projects without hard work and analysis.   Bad accuracy will tell you to go back and do the following:  Check the data flow cid:100 initial datasets, initial hyperparameters, and any value that you can check and change in the data flow Check the data flow graph structure to find flaws and improve them  [ 230 ]   Applying Biomimicking to Artificial Intelligence  Chapter 10  Then start the training process again.

The second input,  cid:90  cid:15  cid:74  cid:79  cid:81  cid:86  cid:85 , comes directly from the input node, as implemented in the following code:   cid:88  cid:74  cid:85  cid:73  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:79  cid:66  cid:78  cid:70  cid:64  cid:84  cid:68  cid:80  cid:81  cid:70  cid:10  cid:9  cid:85  cid:80  cid:85  cid:66  cid:77  cid:9  cid:11  cid:28   cid:68  cid:83  cid:80  cid:84  cid:84  cid:64  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:83  cid:80  cid:81  cid:90  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:83  cid:70  cid:69  cid:86  cid:68  cid:70  cid:64  cid:78  cid:70  cid:66  cid:79  cid:10  cid:69  cid:74  cid:71  cid:71  cid:11   cid:85  cid:71  cid:16  cid:84  cid:86  cid:78  cid:78  cid:66  cid:83  cid:90  cid:16  cid:84  cid:68  cid:66  cid:77  cid:66  cid:83  cid:10  cid:9  cid:68  cid:83  cid:80  cid:84  cid:84  cid:64  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:83  cid:80  cid:81  cid:90  cid:9  cid:14  cid:2  cid:68  cid:83  cid:80  cid:84  cid:84  cid:64  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:83  cid:80  cid:81  cid:90  cid:11   TensorFlow measures its progression as shown in the  cid:68  cid:83  cid:80  cid:84  cid:84  cid:64  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:83  cid:80  cid:81  cid:90  cid:64  cid:19  and  cid:66  cid:68  cid:68  cid:86  cid:66  cid:83  cid:68  cid:90  cid:64  cid:19  charts that follow:  [ 231 ]   Applying Biomimicking to Artificial Intelligence  Chapter 10  Note how nicely the value of cross-entropy goes down a nice gradient  slope  as the loss function as the training progresses. This curve shows that the errors are being reduced. Then note how nicely the accuracy curve goes up as the errors diminish.  Think about it. In real-life projects, the cross-entropy completely slows down at one point while accuracy becomes erratic. The effect of this will be limited because cross-entropy takes the correct predictions into account.  However, more often than not, hard work needs to be put in when facing our implementations.

Explore all of the information about all the other sections: SCALARS, IMAGES, DISTRIBUTIONS, and HISTOGRAMS provided by this unit testing program. The more you know when things go wrong, the faster you will correct them.  Optimizing speed with Google's Tensor Processing Unit Exploring a unit-testing model represents an effort on our part. Now, imagine having to build a model that is 10 times this size. Training the model to find out where and why things went wrong may prove time consuming.   Google has come up with an innovation: a Tensor Processing Unit  TPU . Google Search, Google Translate, and Google Photos use a TPU to speed up computations.  Making that available to us on its data centers will make a difference. TensorBoard already has a key function you might want to explore while building a complex and time- consuming model. This function is the TPU Compatibility option on TensorBoard  see the following screenshot .  [ 233 ]   Applying Biomimicking to Artificial Intelligence  Chapter 10  Click on TPU Compatibility  this chapter used the Structure option until now .  The following graph will now display the levels of TPU compatibility of each node  green + red proportions :  This means that, in future when you are designing a complex model, you should keep an eye on TPU compatibility if you are going to consume a lot of CPU GPU.   [ 234 ]   Applying Biomimicking to Artificial Intelligence  Chapter 10  TensorBoard also provides the following list, for example, to display each level you are drilling down to:  Even if you do not have access to a TPU, the read nodes will signal where you have to be careful. You may want to optimize the model before even starting to train it.  [ 235 ]   Applying Biomimicking to Artificial Intelligence  Chapter 10  One of the main nodes to keep an eye on is the training node that contains the Adam optimizer, as shown in the following screenshot:  As models grow larger and larger, optimization will become a key field. Teams will have to optimize data graph structures, data flows, and machine configuration, including network speeds  and balancing .  Summary The TensorFlow model represented in TensorBoard contains several basic building blocks of ANNs, whether they are CNNs, RNNs such as LTSM networks, or other forms. All of these models rely on numerical computation in one form or the other: weights, biases,  cid:78  cid:66  cid:85  cid:78  cid:86  cid:77  operations, activation functions  logistic sigmoid, ReLU, or others , layers, optimizers, loss functions, and more. All of these tools belong to the field of applied mathematics.  This approach has been around for decades. However, as time goes by, linguists, philosophers, historians, and many more people fascinated by AI will bring new ideas, new programming languages, interfaces, and APIs. Focus on the core concepts, not the tools, and you will always be able to keep up to date and innovate.  Biomimicking humans will inevitably be extended to conceptual representation learning, the fascinating world of our video-clipped minds.  Complex projects require conceptual representation.

Take everything you see as opportunities and see how it can fit in your projects. Reach the limits and skydive beyond them.  This chapter focuses on decision-making and visual representations and explains the motivation leading to conceptual representation learning  CRL  and meta models  MM , which form CRLMMs. I developed this CRLMM method successfully for automatic planning and scheduling  APS  software  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:20 , Automated Planning and Scheduling  for corporate projects.

To plan, humans need to visualize necessary information  events, locations, and so on  and more critical dimensions such as concepts. A human being thinks in mental images. When we think, mental images flow through minds with numbers, sounds, odors, and sensations, transforming our environment into fantastic multidimensional representations similar to video clips.    Conceptual Representation Learning  Chapter 11  The following topics will be covered in this chapter:  An approach to CRLMM in three steps: transfer learning, domain learning, and the motivation for using CRLMM. Over the years, I've successfully implemented CRL in C++, Java, and logic programming  Prolog  in various forms on corporate sites. In this chapter, I used Python to illustrate the approach with the Keras Convolutional Neural Network  CNN  built in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:27 , Getting Your Neurons to Work.

mental images with some words. Our thoughts contain concepts, on which we build solutions. The trained model of  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:27 , Getting Your Neurons to Work, can now classify images of a certain type. In this section, the trained model will be loaded and then generalized through transfer learning to classify similar images.   The motivation of transfer learning Transfer learning provides a cost-effective way of using trained models for other purposes within the same company, such as the food processing company described in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:27 , Getting Your Neurons to Work. This chapter describes how this food processing company used the model for other similar purposes.  The company that succeeds in doing this will progressively generalize the use of the solution. By doing so, inductive abstraction will take place and lead to other AI projects, which proves gratifying to the management of a corporation and the teams providing the solutions.  Inductive thinking Induction uses inferences to reach a conclusion. For example, a food processing conveyor belt with missing products will lead to packaging productivity problems. If insufficient amounts of products reach the packaging section, this will slow down the whole production process.   [ 240 ]   Conceptual Representation Learning  Chapter 11  By observing similar problems in other areas of the company, inferences from managers will come up, such as, If insufficient amounts of products flow through the process, production will slow down.  Inductive abstraction The project team in charge of improving efficiency in the company needs to find an abstract representation of the problem to implement a solution through organization or software. This book deals with the AI side of solving the problem. Organizational processes need to define how AI will fit in with several on-site meetings.  The problem AI needs to solve In this particular case, each section of the factory has an optimal production rate defined per hour or per day, for example. The equation of an optimal production rate  OPR  per hour can be summed up as follows:  OPR : min p s  <=opr<=max p s    Where:  p is the production rate of a given section  different production departments of a factory  s. p s  is the production rate of the section. min p s   is the historical minimum  trial and error over months of analysis . Under that level, the whole production process will slow down. max p s   is the historical maximum. Over that level, the whole production process will slow down as well. OPR is the optimal production rate.  The first time somebody sees this equation, it seems difficult to understand. The difficulty arises because one has to visualize the process, which is the goal of this chapter. Every warehouse, industry, and service uses production rates as a constraint to reach profitable levels.  [ 241 ]   Conceptual Representation Learning  Chapter 11  Visualization requires representation at two levels:  Ensuring that if a packaging department is not receiving enough products, it will have to slow down or even stop sometimes. Ensuring that if a packaging department receives too many products, it will not be able to package them. If the input is a conveyor belt with no intermediate storage  present-day trends , then it will have to be slowed down, slowing down or stopping the processes before that point.  In both cases, slowing down production leads to bad financial results and critical sales problems through late deliveries.  In both cases, an OPR gap is a problem. To solve it, another level of abstraction is required. First, let's separate the OPR equation into two parts:  Now let's find a higher control level through variance variable v:  v min and v max are the absolute values of the variance in both situations  not enough products to produce and too many to produce respectively .  The final representation is through a single control, detection, and learning rate  Greek gamma letter :  This means that the variance between the optimal production rate of a given section of a company and its minimum speed  products per hour  will slow the following section down. If too few cakes  vmin , for example, are produced, then the cake packaging department will be waiting and stopping. If too many cakes are produced  vmax , then this section will have to slow down or stop. Both variances will create problems in a company that cannot manage intermediate storage easily, which is the case with the food processing industry. With this single  cid:98  parameter,  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:27 , Getting Your Neurons to Work, Keras CNN, can start teaching a fundamental production concept: what a physical gap is.  [ 242 ]   Conceptual Representation Learning The  cid:98  gap concept Teaching the CNN the gap concept will help it extend its thinking power to many fields:  Chapter 11  A gap in production, as explained before A gap in a traffic lane for a self-driving vehicle to move into Any incomplete, deficient area Any opening or window  Let's teach a CNN the  cid:107  gap concept, or simply  cid:98 . To achieve that goal, the CNN Keras model that was trained and saved in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:27 , Getting Your Neurons to Work, now needs to be loaded and used. To grasp the implications of the  cid:107  concept, imagine the cost of not producing enough customer orders or having piles of unfinished products everywhere. The financial transposition of the physical gap is a profit variance on set goals. We all know the pain those variances lead to. Understanding and solving the  cid:107 -gap problem will constitute a primary goal in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70 r 12, Automated Planning and Scheduling.  Loading the Keras model after training The technical goal is to load and use the trained CNN Keras model and then use the same model for other similar areas. The practical goal is to teach the CNN how to use the  cid:98  concept to enhance the thinking abilities of the scheduling, chatbot, and other applications.  Loading the model has two main functions:  Loading the model to compile and classify new images without training the model Displaying the parameters used layer by layer and displaying the weights reached during the learning and training phase  Loading the model to optimize training A limited number of headers suffice to read a saved model with  cid:51  cid:38  cid:34  cid:37  cid:64  cid:36  cid:47  cid:47  cid:64  cid:46  cid:48  cid:37  cid:38  cid:45  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90 , as implemented in the following lines:   cid:71  cid:83  cid:80  cid:78  cid:2  cid:76  cid:70  cid:83  cid:66  cid:84  cid:16  cid:78  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:77  cid:84  cid:2  cid:74  cid:78  cid:81  cid:80  cid:83  cid:85  cid:2  cid:78  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:77  cid:64  cid:71  cid:83  cid:80  cid:78  cid:64  cid:75  cid:84  cid:80  cid:79   cid:71  cid:83  cid:80  cid:78  cid:2  cid:76  cid:70  cid:83  cid:66  cid:84  cid:16  cid:78  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:77  cid:84  cid:2  cid:74  cid:78  cid:81  cid:80  cid:83  cid:85  cid:2  cid:77  cid:80  cid:66  cid:69  cid:64  cid:78  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:77   cid:74  cid:78  cid:81  cid:80  cid:83  cid:85  cid:2  cid:75  cid:84  cid:80  cid:79   cid:71  cid:83  cid:80  cid:78  cid:2  cid:81  cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:2  cid:74  cid:78  cid:81  cid:80  cid:83  cid:85  cid:2  cid:81  cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85   [ 243 ]   Conceptual Representation Learning  Chapter 11   cid:5  cid:37  cid:74  cid:83  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:68  cid:80  cid:79  cid:85  cid:66  cid:74  cid:79  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:78  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:77  cid:2  cid:71  cid:74  cid:77  cid:70   cid:69  cid:74  cid:83  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:80  cid:83  cid:90  cid:31  cid:9  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:84  cid:70  cid:85  cid:17  cid:9   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:4  cid:69  cid:74  cid:83  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:80  cid:83  cid:90  cid:4  cid:14  cid:69  cid:74  cid:83  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:80  cid:83  cid:90  cid:11   The  cid:16  cid:75  cid:84  cid:80  cid:79  model saved is now loaded from its file as shown here:   cid:5  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:45  cid:48  cid:34  cid:37  cid:2  cid:46  cid:48  cid:37  cid:38  cid:45  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64   cid:75  cid:84  cid:80  cid:79  cid:64  cid:71  cid:74  cid:77  cid:70  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:80  cid:81  cid:70  cid:79  cid:10  cid:69  cid:74  cid:83  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:80  cid:83  cid:90  cid:13  cid:9  cid:78  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:77  cid:17  cid:78  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:77  cid:16  cid:75  cid:84  cid:80  cid:79  cid:9  cid:14  cid:2  cid:9  cid:83  cid:9  cid:11   cid:77  cid:80  cid:66  cid:69  cid:70  cid:69  cid:64  cid:75  cid:84  cid:80  cid:79  cid:71  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:75  cid:84  cid:80  cid:79  cid:64  cid:71  cid:74  cid:77  cid:70  cid:16  cid:83  cid:70  cid:66  cid:69  cid:10  cid:11   cid:77  cid:80  cid:66  cid:69  cid:70  cid:69  cid:64  cid:75  cid:84  cid:80  cid:79  cid:31  cid:75  cid:84  cid:80  cid:79  cid:16  cid:77  cid:80  cid:66  cid:69  cid:84  cid:10  cid:77  cid:80  cid:66  cid:69  cid:70  cid:69  cid:64  cid:75  cid:84  cid:80  cid:79  cid:71  cid:11   cid:75  cid:84  cid:80  cid:79  cid:64  cid:71  cid:74  cid:77  cid:70  cid:16  cid:68  cid:77  cid:80  cid:84  cid:70  cid:10  cid:11   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:4  cid:46  cid:48  cid:37  cid:38  cid:45  cid:28  cid:4  cid:11   cid:81  cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:77  cid:80  cid:66  cid:69  cid:70  cid:69  cid:64  cid:75  cid:84  cid:80  cid:79  cid:11   I used the  cid:81  cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  function in the following code instead of  cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  to obtain a pretty print formatted display of the model:   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:4  cid:46  cid:48  cid:37  cid:38  cid:45  cid:28  cid:4  cid:11   cid:81  cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:77  cid:80  cid:66  cid:69  cid:70  cid:69  cid:64  cid:75  cid:84  cid:80  cid:79  cid:11   Reading the model is not a formality.

One reason could be that the next layer will explore the edge of the image and that we need to explore them with kernels that fit in the shape.  In that case, a padding of size 1 can be added with  cid:18  values as shown in the following matrix:  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 24 4 0 5 0 0 3 7 8 0 6 4 5 4 0 1 0 0 5 4 3 0 0 0 0 0 0  A padding of size 2 would add two rows and columns around the initial shape.  [ 245 ]   Conceptual Representation Learning  Chapter 11  With that in mind, fine-tuning your training model by adding as many options as necessary will improve the quality of the results. The weights can be viewed by extracting them from the saved model file layer by layer, as shown in the following code snippet:   cid:5  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:2  cid:45  cid:48  cid:34  cid:37  cid:2  cid:56  cid:38  cid:42  cid:40  cid:41  cid:53  cid:52  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64  cid:64    cid:77  cid:80  cid:66  cid:69  cid:70  cid:69  cid:64  cid:78  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:77  cid:31  cid:78  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:77  cid:64  cid:71  cid:83  cid:80  cid:78  cid:64  cid:75  cid:84  cid:80  cid:79  cid:10  cid:77  cid:80  cid:66  cid:69  cid:70  cid:69  cid:64  cid:75  cid:84  cid:80  cid:79  cid:71  cid:11   cid:77  cid:80  cid:66  cid:69  cid:70  cid:69  cid:64  cid:78  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:77  cid:16  cid:77  cid:80  cid:66  cid:69  cid:64  cid:88  cid:70  cid:74  cid:72  cid:73  cid:85  cid:84  cid:10  cid:69  cid:74  cid:83  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:80  cid:83  cid:90  cid:13  cid:4  cid:78  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:77  cid:17  cid:78  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:77  cid:16  cid:73  cid:23  cid:4  cid:11   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:4  cid:56  cid:38  cid:42  cid:40  cid:41  cid:53  cid:52  cid:4  cid:11   cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:77  cid:66  cid:90  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:77  cid:80  cid:66  cid:69  cid:70  cid:69  cid:64  cid:78  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:77  cid:16  cid:77  cid:66  cid:90  cid:70  cid:83  cid:84  cid:28   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:88  cid:70  cid:74  cid:72  cid:73  cid:85  cid:84  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:77  cid:66  cid:90  cid:70  cid:83  cid:16  cid:72  cid:70  cid:85  cid:64  cid:88  cid:70  cid:74  cid:72  cid:73  cid:85  cid:84  cid:10  cid:11  cid:2  cid:5  cid:2  cid:77  cid:74  cid:84  cid:85  cid:2  cid:80  cid:71  cid:2  cid:79  cid:86  cid:78  cid:81  cid:90  cid:2  cid:66  cid:83  cid:83  cid:66  cid:90  cid:84   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:88  cid:70  cid:74  cid:72  cid:73  cid:85  cid:84  cid:11   Analyzing the weights used by the program will provide useful information about the way the optimizing process was carried out by the program. Sometimes, a program will get stuck, and the weights might seem off track. After all, a CNN can contain imperfections like any other program.  A look at the following output, for example, can help understand where the system went wrong:   cid:56  cid:38  cid:42  cid:40  cid:41  cid:53  cid:52   cid:60  cid:66  cid:83  cid:83  cid:66  cid:90  cid:10  cid:60  cid:60  cid:60  cid:60  cid:15  cid:18  cid:16  cid:19  cid:18  cid:18  cid:23  cid:22  cid:19  cid:24  cid:2  cid:14  cid:2  cid:15  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:26  cid:23  cid:26  cid:20  cid:24  cid:18  cid:24  cid:14  cid:2  cid:15  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:23  cid:26  cid:19  cid:25  cid:24  cid:2  cid:14  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:19  cid:19  cid:22  cid:23  cid:21  cid:27  cid:21  cid:24  cid:14  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:22  cid:23  cid:19  cid:19  cid:18  cid:23  cid:20  cid:14   cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:23  cid:21  cid:26  cid:27  cid:22  cid:24  cid:22  cid:14  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:21  cid:21  cid:19  cid:24  cid:20  cid:22  cid:19  cid:14  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:19  cid:18  cid:24  cid:26  cid:19  cid:18  cid:21  cid:25  cid:14  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:26  cid:25  cid:22  cid:21  cid:27  cid:23  cid:25  cid:14  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18  cid:25  cid:26  cid:20  cid:22  cid:2  cid:14   cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:27  cid:24  cid:26  cid:20  cid:27  cid:26  cid:27  cid:14  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:19  cid:27  cid:20  cid:24  cid:22  cid:27  cid:24  cid:14  cid:2  cid:15  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:18  cid:22  cid:25  cid:22  cid:20  cid:21  cid:26  cid:14  cid:2  cid:15  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:23  cid:18  cid:23  cid:21  cid:19  cid:23  cid:25  cid:14  cid:2  cid:15  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:25  cid:24  cid:23  cid:25  cid:26  cid:23  cid:24  cid:14   cid:2  cid:15  cid:18  cid:16  cid:19  cid:18  cid:18  cid:19  cid:25  cid:18  cid:26  cid:25  cid:14  cid:2  cid:15  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:26  cid:22  cid:20  cid:23  cid:23  cid:26  cid:25  cid:14  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:24  cid:24  cid:23  cid:20  cid:19  cid:21  cid:20  cid:14  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:22  cid:18  cid:19  cid:26  cid:24  cid:18  cid:25  cid:14  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:19  cid:21  cid:21  cid:20  cid:21  cid:22  cid:24  cid:27  cid:14   cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:19  cid:20  cid:19  cid:21  cid:19  cid:27  cid:19  cid:22  cid:14  cid:2  cid:15  cid:18  cid:16  cid:19  cid:19  cid:25  cid:18  cid:18  cid:22  cid:24  cid:21  cid:14  cid:2  cid:15  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:27  cid:23  cid:27  cid:23  cid:18  cid:19  cid:24  cid:14  cid:2  cid:15  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:26  cid:25  cid:21  cid:18  cid:22  cid:18  cid:21  cid:14  cid:2  cid:15  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:24  cid:22  cid:18  cid:26  cid:27  cid:21  cid:20  cid:14   cid:2  cid:15  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:24  cid:19  cid:21  cid:20  cid:20  cid:25  cid:2  cid:14  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:19  cid:21  cid:22  cid:20  cid:25  cid:24  cid:27  cid:25  cid:14  cid:2  cid:15  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:26  cid:20  cid:20  cid:24  cid:27  cid:21  cid:20  cid:14  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:27  cid:25  cid:25  cid:24  cid:20  cid:25  cid:21  cid:14  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:18  cid:23  cid:22  cid:18  cid:18  cid:26  cid:26  cid:14   cid:2  cid:15  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:20  cid:21  cid:19  cid:21  cid:23  cid:22  cid:21  cid:14  cid:2  cid:15  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:21  cid:22  cid:24  cid:22  cid:25  cid:27  cid:19  cid:62  cid:14   Much has been written about how to build CNNs and little about how to maintain them.

To test  cid:81  cid:83  cid:70  cid:69  cid:74  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:20 , just change the  cid:83  cid:70  cid:85  cid:86  cid:83  cid:79  instruction.  Once a CNN is running, it can prove difficult to find out what went wrong. Checking the output of each layer and component while building the network saves fine-tuning time once the full-blown model produces thousands of results.  The following example detects product  cid:98  gaps on a conveyor belt in a food processing factory. The program loads the first image stored in the  cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:90  directory to predict its value.

A convolutional neural network contains marvels of applied mathematics. CNNs epitomize deep learning in themselves. A researcher could easily spend hundreds of hours studying them.  However, applied mathematics in the business world requires profitability. As such, the components of CNNs appear as ever-evolving concepts. Added kernels, activation functions, pooling, flattening, dense layers, and compiling and training methods act as a starting point for architectures, not as a finality.   cid:54  cid:84  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:84  cid:71  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:77  cid:70  cid:66  cid:83  cid:79  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:85  cid:80  cid:2  cid:67  cid:70  cid:2  cid:81  cid:83  cid:80  cid:96  cid:85  cid:66  cid:67  cid:77  cid:70  cid:2  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:84  cid:70  cid:70  cid:2  cid:66  cid:2  cid:81  cid:83  cid:80  cid:75  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:2  cid:84  cid:85  cid:80  cid:81  cid:81  cid:70  cid:69  At one point, a company will demand results or shelve the project. If a spreadsheet represents a faster and a sufficient solution, a deep learning project will face potential competition and rejection. Many engineers learning artificial intelligence will have to assume the role of standard SQL reporting experts before accessing real AI projects.  Transfer learning appears as a solution to the present cost of building and training a CNN program. Your model might just pay off that way. The idea is to get a basic AI model rolling profits in fast for your customer and management. Then you will have everybody's attention. To do that, you must define strategies.  [ 249 ]   Conceptual Representation Learning  Chapter 11  Defining the strategy If a deep learning CNN expert, for example, our friend Pert Ex, comes to a top manager saying that this CNN model can classify CIFAR-10 images of dogs, cats, cars, plants, and more, the answer will be, So what? My 3-year-old child can too. In fact, so can my dog!  The IT manager in that meeting might even blurt out something like, We have all the decision tools we need right now, and our profits are increasing. Why would we invest in a CNN?  The core problem of marketing AI to real-world companies is that it relies upon the belief in the  necessity of a CNN in the first place. Spreadsheets, SQL queries, standard automation, and software do 99% of the job. Most of the time, it does not take a CNN to replace many jobs; just an automated spreadsheet, a query, or standard and straightforward software is enough. Jobs have been sliced into simple-enough parts for decades to replace humans with basic software.  Before presenting a CNN, Pert Ex has to find out how much the company can earn using it. Pert has found an area with a quick win to show the power of the system in a cost- effective way.  Understanding, designing, building, and running a CNN does not mean much regarding business. All the hard work we put in to understanding and running these complex programs will add up to nothing if we cannot prove that a solution will generate profit. Without profit, the implementation costs cannot be recovered, and nobody will listen to a presentation about even a fantastic program.  Pert Ex describes the example in the previous section applied to this food processing company.  Applying the model At the food processing company, one of the packaging lines has a performance problem. Sometimes, randomly, some of the cakes are missing on the conveyor belt, as shown in the following frame:  [ 250 ]   Conceptual Representation Learning  Chapter 11  Pert explains that to start a cost-effective project, a cheap webcam could be installed over the conveyor belt. It'll take a random sample picture every 10 seconds and process it to find the holes as shown in the interval between the two blue lines. If a hole is detected, it means some cakes have not made it to the conveyor belt  production errors .   Pert estimates that a 2% to 5% productivity rate increase could be obtained by automatically sending a signal to the production robot when some cakes are missing.  The CEO decides to try this system out and approves a prototype test budget.  Making the model profitable by using it for another problem The food processing experiment on the conveyor belt turns out to work well enough with dataset type d1 and the CNN model M to encourage generalization to another dataset, d2, in the same company.  Transfer learning consists of going from M d1  to M d2  using the same CNN model M, with some limited, cost-effective additional training. Variations will appear, but they will be solved by shifting a few parameters and working on the input data following some basic dataset preparation rules:  Overfitting: When the model fits the training data quickly with 100% accuracy, this may  or not be a problem. In the case of classifying holes on the conveyor, belt overfitting might not prove critical. The shapes are always the same and the environment remains stable. However, in an unstable situation with all sorts of different images or products, then overfitting will limit the effectiveness of a system. Underfitting: If the accuracy drops down to low levels such as 20%, then the CNN or any other model will not work. The datasets and parameters need optimizing. Maybe the number of samples needs to be increased for M d2 , or reduced, or split into different groups. Regularization: Regularization, in general, involves the process of finding how to fix the generalization problem of M d2 , not the training errors of M d2 . Maybe an activation function needs some improvements, or the way the weights have been implemented require attention.  [ 251 ]   Conceptual Representation Learning  Chapter 11  There is no limit to the number of methods you can apply to find a solution, just like standard software program improvement.   cid:56  cid:73  cid:70  cid:83  cid:70  cid:2  cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:84  cid:71  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:77  cid:70  cid:66  cid:83  cid:79  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:70  cid:79  cid:69  cid:84  cid:2  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:2  cid:69  cid:80  cid:78  cid:66  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:77  cid:70  cid:66  cid:83  cid:79  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:67  cid:70  cid:72  cid:74  cid:79  cid:84  Transfer learning can be used for similar types of objects, or images in this case as explained. The more similar images you can train within a company with the same model, the more the return on investment  ROI  it will produce and the more this company will ask you for more AI innovations.   Domain learning takes a model such as the one described in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:27 , Getting your Neurons to Work, and that describe in this chapter to generalize it. The generalization process will lead us to domain learning.  Domain learning This section on domain learning builds a bridge between classic transfer learning, as described previously, and another use of domain learning I found profitable in corporate projects: teaching a machine a concept  CRLMM . The chapter focuses on teaching a machine to learn to recognize a gap in situations other than at the food processing company.

GAP  cid:97  loaded or unloaded In  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:20 , Automated Planning and Scheduling, CRLMM will be applied to automatic planning and scheduling  APS . When planning in general, in a factory for example, a key concept of a gap is unloaded, loaded.  [ 253 ]   Conceptual Representation Learning  Chapter 11  Set the scenario to 0 in  cid:36  cid:47  cid:47  cid:64  cid:53  cid:37  cid:36  cid:64  cid:52  cid:53  cid:51  cid:34  cid:53  cid:38  cid:40  cid:58  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  to run this conceptual model:  cid:84  cid:68  cid:70  cid:79  cid:66  cid:83  cid:74  cid:80  cid:31  cid:18  cid:2  cid:5  cid:83  cid:70  cid:71  cid:70  cid:83  cid:70  cid:79  cid:68  cid:70  cid:2  cid:85  cid:80  cid:2  cid:34  cid:14  cid:46  cid:52  cid:19  cid:14  cid:46  cid:52  cid:20 .  The gap concept has just become a polysemy word concept  polysemy means different meanings; see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:26 , Revolutions Designed for Some Corporations and Disruptive Innovations Small to Large Companies . In the cake situation, the  cid:107  gap was negative in its g1 subset of meaning and concepts applied to a CNN, relating it to negative images n+g1:  ng1={missing, not enough, slowing production down...bad}  The full-of-products image was positive, p+g2:  pg2={good production flow, no gap}  In this example, the CNN is learning how to distinguish an abstract representation, not an image like for the cakes. Another subset of  cid:107  gap conceptual dataset  is loaded unloaded.  The following abstract image is loaded. The squares represent some kind of production machine and the arrows represent the load-in time. This means that the x axis represents time and the y axis represents machine production resources.  [ 254 ]   Conceptual Representation Learning  Chapter 11  The CNN model runs and produces the following result:   cid:69  cid:74  cid:83  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:80  cid:83  cid:90  cid:2  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:84  cid:70  cid:85  cid:64  cid:48  cid:17   cid:52  cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70  cid:72  cid:90  cid:2  cid:78  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:77  cid:2  cid:77  cid:80  cid:66  cid:69  cid:70  cid:69  cid:2  cid:71  cid:83  cid:80  cid:78  cid:2  cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:74  cid:79  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:83  cid:70  cid:81  cid:80  cid:84  cid:74  cid:85  cid:80  cid:83  cid:90  cid:16   cid:74  cid:78  cid:66  cid:72  cid:70  cid:2  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:84  cid:70  cid:85  cid:64  cid:48  cid:17  cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:90  cid:17  cid:74  cid:78  cid:72  cid:19  cid:16  cid:75  cid:81  cid:72  cid:2  cid:81  cid:83  cid:70  cid:69  cid:74  cid:68  cid:85  cid:64  cid:81  cid:83  cid:80  cid:67  cid:66  cid:28  cid:2  cid:60  cid:60  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:62  cid:62  cid:2  cid:81  cid:83  cid:70  cid:69  cid:74  cid:68  cid:85  cid:28  cid:2  cid:60  cid:60  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:62  cid:62   cid:36  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:74  cid:70  cid:69  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:2  cid:34   cid:77  cid:80  cid:66  cid:69  cid:70  cid:69   cid:52  cid:70  cid:70  cid:76  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:16  cid:16  cid:16   The CNN recognizes this as loaded. The task goes beyond classifying. The system needs to recognize this to make a decision.   Another image produces a different result. In this case, an unloaded gap appears in the following screenshot:  And the CNN has a different output, as shown here:   cid:52  cid:70  cid:70  cid:76  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:16  cid:16  cid:16   cid:74  cid:78  cid:66  cid:72  cid:70  cid:2  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:84  cid:70  cid:85  cid:64  cid:48  cid:17  cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:90  cid:17  cid:74  cid:78  cid:72  cid:20  cid:16  cid:75  cid:81  cid:72  cid:2  cid:81  cid:83  cid:70  cid:69  cid:74  cid:68  cid:85  cid:64  cid:81  cid:83  cid:80  cid:67  cid:66  cid:28  cid:2  cid:60  cid:60  cid:2  cid:19  cid:16  cid:62  cid:62  cid:2  cid:81  cid:83  cid:70  cid:69  cid:74  cid:68  cid:85  cid:28  cid:2  cid:60  cid:60  cid:2  cid:19  cid:16  cid:62  cid:62   cid:36  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:74  cid:70  cid:69  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84   cid:86  cid:79  cid:77  cid:80  cid:66  cid:69  cid:70  cid:69   The gap concept  cid:107  has added two other subsets, g3 and g4, to its dataset. We now have:   cid:99 ={ng1,g2,g3,g4...gn}  [ 255 ]   Conceptual Representation Learning  The four g1 to g4 subsets of  cid:98  are:  Chapter 11  ng1={missing, not enough, slowing production down...bad}  pg2=pg2={good production flow, no gap}  g3={loaded}  g4={unloaded}  The remaining problem will take some time to solve. g4  gap  can sometimes represent an opportunity for a machine that does not have a good workload to be open to more production. In some cases, g4 becomes pg4 p = positive . In other cases, it will become ng4  n=negative  if production rates go down.  As in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:26 , Revolutions Designed for Some Corporations and Disruptive Innovations for Small to Large Companies, the context had become strategic when a bus  coach  broke down and the translation came out as a trainer  coach  and not as a vehicle. The problem in these situations relies on the fact that additional input information is required. More words will not help. CRLMM will bring additional concepts into the model.  GAP  cid:97  jammed or open lanes A self-driving car needs to recognize whether it is in a traffic jam or not. Also, the self- driving car has to know how to change lanes when it detects enough space  a gap  to do that.  This produces two new subsets:  g5={traffic jam, heavy traffic...too much traffic}  g6={open lane, light traffic...normal traffic}  [ 256 ]   Conceptual Representation Learning  Chapter 11  The model now detects g5  traffic jam , as shown in the following screenshot:  The following output appears correctly:   cid:69  cid:74  cid:83  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:80  cid:83  cid:90  cid:2  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:84  cid:70  cid:85  cid:64  cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:71  cid:71  cid:74  cid:68  cid:17   cid:52  cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70  cid:72  cid:90  cid:2  cid:78  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:77  cid:2  cid:77  cid:80  cid:66  cid:69  cid:70  cid:69  cid:2  cid:71  cid:83  cid:80  cid:78  cid:2  cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:74  cid:79  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:83  cid:70  cid:81  cid:80  cid:84  cid:74  cid:85  cid:80  cid:83  cid:90  cid:16   cid:74  cid:78  cid:66  cid:72  cid:70  cid:2  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:84  cid:70  cid:85  cid:64  cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:71  cid:71  cid:74  cid:68  cid:17  cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:90  cid:17  cid:74  cid:78  cid:72  cid:19  cid:16  cid:75  cid:81  cid:72  cid:2  cid:81  cid:83  cid:70  cid:69  cid:74  cid:68  cid:85  cid:64  cid:81  cid:83  cid:80  cid:67  cid:66  cid:28  cid:2  cid:60  cid:60  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:62  cid:62  cid:2  cid:81  cid:83  cid:70  cid:69  cid:74  cid:68  cid:85  cid:28  cid:2  cid:60  cid:60   cid:18  cid:16  cid:62  cid:62   cid:36  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:74  cid:70  cid:69  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:2  cid:34   cid:75  cid:66  cid:78  cid:78  cid:70  cid:69   g6 comes out right as well, as shown in this screenshot:  [ 257 ]   Conceptual Representation Learning  Chapter 11  A potential lane change has become possible, as detected by the following code:   cid:52  cid:70  cid:70  cid:76  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:16  cid:16  cid:16   cid:74  cid:78  cid:66  cid:72  cid:70  cid:2  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:84  cid:70  cid:85  cid:64  cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:71  cid:71  cid:74  cid:68  cid:17  cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:90  cid:17  cid:74  cid:78  cid:72  cid:20  cid:16  cid:75  cid:81  cid:72  cid:2  cid:81  cid:83  cid:70  cid:69  cid:74  cid:68  cid:85  cid:64  cid:81  cid:83  cid:80  cid:67  cid:66  cid:28  cid:2  cid:60  cid:60  cid:2  cid:19  cid:16  cid:62  cid:62  cid:2  cid:81  cid:83  cid:70  cid:69  cid:74  cid:68  cid:85  cid:28  cid:2  cid:60  cid:60   cid:19  cid:16  cid:62  cid:62   cid:36  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:74  cid:70  cid:69  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:2  cid:35   cid:68  cid:73  cid:66  cid:79  cid:72  cid:70   The gap dataset At this point, the  cid:98  gap conceptual dataset  has begun to learn several subsets:   cid:99 ={g1,g2,g3,g4,g5,g6}  In which:  ng1={missing, not enough, slowing production down...bad}  pg2=pg2={good production flow, no gap}  pg4={traﬃc jam, heavy traﬃc...too much traﬃc}ng5={open lane, light traﬃc...normal traﬃc}  Notice that g2 and g3 do not have labels yet. The food processing context provided the label. Concept detection requires a context, which CRLMMs will provide.  Generalizing the  cid:98  gap conceptual dataset  The generalization of  cid:98  gap conceptual dataset  will provide a conceptual tool for meta- models.   g2={loaded}  g3={unloaded}  [ 258 ]   Conceptual Representation Learning  Chapter 11   cid:107  gap conceptual dataset  refers to negative, positive, or undetermined space between two elements  objects, locations, or products on a production line .   cid:98   gamma  also refers to a gap in time: too long, not long enough, too short, or not short enough.  cid:98  represents the distance between two locations: too far or too close.  cid:98  represents a misunderstanding or an understanding between two parties: a divergence of opinions or a convergence.  All of these examples refer to gaps in space and time viewed as space.  Generative adversarial networks Using GANs to generate concept-word images can boost the production CRL datasets and produce millions of concept-word images. No single solution will suffice. CNNs can do the job; GANs can also. Suppose the  cid:98  gap concept needs to be generalized to thousands of situations. Millions of images with words could be analyzed and automatically stored in a  cid:98  dataset, with tens of thousands of image-word concepts of gaps.  A GAN could be built in a few lines with the following components:  Input data for the generator The generator Real data input A discriminator  detects fake data from real data  An optimizer  training   [ 259 ]   Conceptual Representation Learning  Chapter 11  The network starts by inputting real data and fake data  with the generator , as shown in the following diagram:   The discriminator function accepts or rejects the generated data. If the data is rejected, then we are back to known territory  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:27 , Getting Your Neurons to Work  with cross- entropy to measure the loss and an Adam optimizer, for example.  The system will train until it distinguishes right images from fake images like other networks.  What makes GANs interesting is the fact that the generator data has no direct connection with the real data.  It has to go through the discriminator and be trained if it's wrong. Furthermore, the generated data can be labeled with accurate or inaccurate labels although the real data is correctly labeled.   cid:40  cid:70  cid:79  cid:70  cid:83  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:68  cid:80  cid:79  cid:68  cid:70  cid:81  cid:85  cid:86  cid:66  cid:77  cid:2  cid:83  cid:70  cid:81  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:84  A GAN can be used to generate the large datasets required for CRLMMs. The real data could be a set of images with the correct word vectors. The generator could then produce millions of images and labels that the discriminator would work on. The accurately generated datasets could be stored in a CRL repository.  [ 260 ]   Conceptual Representation Learning  Chapter 11  A GAN can be implemented in a few lines of code in TensorFlow, for example. The Further reading section at the end of the chapter provides links that detail this simple but effective type of network.   cid:53  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:86  cid:84  cid:70  cid:2  cid:80  cid:71  cid:2  cid:66  cid:86  cid:85  cid:80  cid:70  cid:79  cid:68  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:83  cid:84  The use of autoencoders must be explored although not recommended for the generation of a conceptual learning dataset.  Data compression has become a part of our daily life through MP3 algorithms, for example. Autoencoding in machine learning is a data compression algorithm.  It takes the original data, compresses it, and can then reconstruct it:  Original input The encoder compresses the data  compressed representation  The decoder reconstructs the data The reconstructed output is produced  They were used for CNNs at a time for data representations. But as shown in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:27 , Getting Your Neurons to Work, random weight initialization scenarios are as effective if not more reliable and flexible.  Two main limitations of autoencoders have restrained their use:  Autoencoders need to be trained on specific data. Being data-specific makes transfer learning tedious. The decompressed output is not 100% reliable. They are lossy, which means that information is lost during the encoding-decoding phase, unlike standard lossless compression algorithms.  Autoencoders can be used in some cases of dimensionality reduction for data visualization and data denoising.  Beyond that, present-day random weight initialization methods are favored for CNN applications.  [ 261 ]   Conceptual Representation Learning  Chapter 11  The motivation of conceptual representation learning meta-models A CRLMM converts images into concepts. These abstract concepts will then be embedded in vectors that become logits for a softmax function and in turn be converted into parameters for complex artificial intelligence programs such as :   Automated planning and scheduling  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:20 , Automated Planning and Scheduling  Cognitive NLP Chatbots  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:23 , Cognitive NLP Chatbots, and  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83   cid:19  cid:24 , Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots   At one point, in some artificial intelligence projects, dimension reduction does not produce good results. When scheduling maintenance on airplanes, rockets, and satellite launcher, for example, thousands of features enter the system without leaving any out. A single missing screw in the wrong place can create a disaster.  The curse of dimensionality  The features for a given project can reach large numbers. The following example contains 1,024 dimensions:  [ 262 ]   Conceptual Representation Learning  Chapter 11  In  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:27 , Getting Your Neurons to Work, and  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:18 , Applying Biomimicking to Artificial Intelligence, kernels and pooling reduced the number of dimensions to extract key features. With those key features in tensors, arrays and or vectors, classification and prediction processes are possible. This process produces effective results in many areas.  The limit of this approach occurs when the result does not reach expectations, such as in some of the cases we will discover in the following chapters. In those cases, CRLMMs will increase the productivity of the solution providing a useful abstract model.  When a solution requires a large number of unreduced dimensions, kernels, pooling, and other dimension reduction methods cannot be applied. CRLMMs will provide a pair of glasses to the system.  The blessing of dimensionality  In some projects, when the model reaches limits that comprise a project, dimensionality is a blessing. Let's focus on three examples described in the next chapters: scheduling, chatbots, and self-driving cars.   cid:52  cid:68  cid:73  cid:70  cid:69  cid:86  cid:77  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:2  cid:67  cid:77  cid:80  cid:68  cid:76  cid:68  cid:73  cid:66  cid:74  cid:79  cid:84  An artificial neural network  ANN  system built on dimension reduction might sometimes be seriously underfitted. As long as it was trained with ready-to-use datasets  MNIST, CIFAR, and others , the system worked fine. It even ran perfectly on small datasets.  Then all of a sudden, on the first week in the food processing industry, for example, it mistakes a positive gap  an available resource  for a negative gap  not enough production .  For example, since a gap meant missing products for several days, the AI system wrongly predicted a negative gap when it was not supposed to. In this circumstance, this was a deliberate choice of the management to slow production down due to resource shortages  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:20 , Automated Planning and Scheduling . Dimensionality enhancements will solve the problem.  Humans reduce the number of possibilities of a problem with logic and inbuilt decision trees. Machines can beat humans in some forms of computation with no logic at all using random memoryless algorithms  MDP; see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19 , Become an Adaptive Thinker . However, present-day deep learning networks, however innovative they are, reduce the dimensions of representation, layer by layer. They flatten them out, drop out information and more to reach a result.  [ 263 ]   Conceptual Representation Learning  Chapter 11  The future of AI will no doubt rely on increasing the number of dimensions way beyond human limits and performing powerful calculations without present-day levels of reduction. Today's state-of-the-art is tomorrow's past. Blow the number of dimensions up to indefinite numbers when it is necessary and possible!   cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:85  cid:67  cid:80  cid:85  cid:84  Most NLP algorithms use probabilities to predict the next words. Or they use preset sentences to answer questions without analyzing the real meaning.   This means building systems that guess, sometimes effectively, sometimes with errors. In any case, they do not think. Many applications produce good results with statistical approaches. But for some projects, customizing a chatbot comes in handy.  For example, imagine that somebody is speaking to you in a language you do not know at all. You have the inbuilt ability of present NLP algorithms to predict representations through statistics on your smartphone.  Although you do not understand a single word, you produce words, statistically, that could fit the situation. For isolated words and simple sentences, you are doing well.  Then all of a sudden, the person frowns. You are totally off track, like many NLP systems today. The person is astonished by your ability to speak and has just said in French, for example, "tu as la patate!"  You understand what Google Translate tells you: "You have the potato!" You have a big question mark on your face. The other person frowns. Oops!  You just spoke in body language: your question mark, the person's frown. Body language constitutes a major part of real communication between humans. Body language needs to be compensated for with empathy as we will explore in the chatbot chapters.  In the meantime, in French colloquial or slang language potate means pep  lots of energy  in English.   Classifying documents, finding keywords, and doing first-level translations  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:26 , Revolutions Designed for Some Corporations and Disruptive Innovations for Small to Large Companies  is one thing; building a smart chatbot beyond language statistics when necessary is another. A CRLMM solution will provide a deeper interaction between a system and humans such as described in the chatbot chapters.  [ 264 ]   Conceptual Representation Learning  Chapter 11   cid:52  cid:70  cid:77  cid:71  cid:15  cid:69  cid:83  cid:74  cid:87  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:68  cid:66  cid:83  cid:84  Self-driving cars will progressively drive everywhere for everything. In the meantime, accidents caused by self-driving cars grab the headlines. Let's imagine some solutions to help them avoid accidents and improve maintenance problems with small but effective CRLMM enhancements.  Humans increase dimensionality to solve problems, find new ideas, clear misunderstandings up, and adapt.  The CRLMMs built as add-ons on the awesome tools we all have access to, give us the opportunity to push the limits of AI further every day.  Summary In this chapter, the Convolution Neural Network  CNN  architecture built in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:27 , Getting Your Neurons to Work, was loaded to classify physical gaps in a food processing company.  Then the trained models were applied to transfer learning by identifying similar types of images. Some of these images represented concepts that lead the trained CNN to identify  cid:98  concept gaps.  cid:98  concept gaps were applied to different fields using the CNN as a training and classification tool in domain learning.  cid:98  concept gaps have two main properties: negative n-gaps and positive p-gaps. To distinguish one from the other, a CRLMM provides a useful add-on. In the food processing company, installing a webcam on the right food processing conveyor belt provided a context for the system to decide whether the gap was positive or negative.  With these concepts in mind, let's build a solution for advanced planning and scheduling  APS  in the next chapter.

Amazon's e-store sales exceed all of their other activities, such as AWS subscription services  premium, for example , retail third-party seller services, and physical stores.  This chapter focuses on Amazon Fashion, one of Amazon's web stores for which Amazon recently registered a patent. Prime Wardrobe even offers a try-and-easy-return service. This new activity requires planning and scheduling. Amazon took the matter seriously and registered a patent for an apparel manufacturing system to control the production process of its apparel products.  Artificial intelligence already plays a role in automatic planning and scheduling in the apparel business, from customer order to delivery.   Recently, Google cid:100 through its DeepMind projects cid:100 is also working on improving the Deep Q-Network  DQN , a system that can beat humans at video games.  This chapter unites both systems with an innovation for the apparel manufacturing industry and adds a Conceptual Representation Learning Meta Model  CRLMM  to DQN. Going from scratch to a prototype that could be implemented on site, the foundations are being set for more applications in the coming chapters.

The customer can establish a purchase plan, the list of tasks to carry out:  Fill a box with clothing, for example Try the clothing at home Return the clothing if it does not fit Purchase the items that are kept  Once the customer agrees to follow this plan, the time sequence becomes crucial:  First, a box must be chosen Then there is a delivery time Then there is a trying time  you cannot try the products forever  Finally, the customer has a purchase time  Whether Amazon Prime Wardrobe will remain a service in the years to come or not, the precedent is set; just as physical bookstores disappear every year, shopping for clothing online will continue its progression.  On top of that distribution, corporations will continue to expand their own production sites to become manufacturing-distributing giants. Warehouses will progressively replace many stores as per the warehouse examples provided in some of the chapters in this book.   Supply Chain Management  SCM  combined with APS has become a necessity. Blockchains ensure the transactions  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:22 , Optimizing Blockchains with AI  and this technology will only expand with these trends.  SCM-APS constraints  depending on the manufacturer  have encouraged Amazon to produce its own clothing. Amazon has produced its own in-house fashion labels with apparel and accessories sold worldwide.   To prove that it means business, Amazon registered patents for a blended reality mirror, an apparel manufacturing system, and more. This way a person can actually visualize how the clothing will fit.  [ 269 ]   Automated Planning and Scheduling  Chapter 12  We will explore the planning and scheduling side of Amazon's apparel in-house manufacturing plans which will have the same effect on apparel factories as it did on physical bookstores and all types of shops. Many new jobs will emerge, such as hundreds of thousands of jobs in the artificial intelligence business, on websites, and in marketing and SCM. Many jobs will disappear as well. The improvement made will boost medical progress and also the defense industry. The social and economical implications are beyond the scope of this book and possibly beyond our comprehension as in all disruptive eras in the past.  We will focus in depth on the main aspects of Amazon's patented custom clothing process. As mentioned before, whether it turns into a success or not, the precedent is set.  A real-time manufacturing process The key concept in Amazon's approach is real-time. Pushing the physical limits of centuries of commerce, Amazon's brand takes the manufacturing process right beyond the cutting edge.  Amazon must expand its services to face competition Amazon could have continued to purchase products from its suppliers and not manufacture them. Instead of using artificial intelligence to solve the conveyor belt problem, several sensors could be installed with traditional software solutions.  Mankind could also have continued to use horses instead of cars and paper instead of computers. However, once a disruptive innovation has been successfully launched by a company, competition must either follow or disappear. Amazon needs to get involved in manufacturing somehow with this apparel manufacturing patent, 3-D printers, and other innovations in order to increase its productivity.   Artificial intelligence needs to be confronted with difficult industrial problems to improve its experience and progress to achieve higher machine learning levels and meet greater challenges.  A real-time manufacturing revolution Artificial intelligence software, though spectacular, is not the only revolution changing our lives forever. Real-time is a strong force that will change every process in the world.  [ 270 ]   Automated Planning and Scheduling  Chapter 12  Apparel manufacturing and manufacturing, in general, follow an advanced planning and scheduling process today. Amazon's manufacturing department, just like Elon Musk's Tesla self-driving cars  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:21 , AI and The Internet of Things  IoT , and  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83   cid:19  cid:22 , Optimizing Blockchains with AI , require automated planning and scheduling, not advanced planning and scheduling.  The fundamental difference between the two systems relies on the time factor as shown in the following comparison table. The difference between an advanced and an automated system seems small but Amazon, like others, will change the course of history with those differences. Both systems, in theory, can do both types of tasks. In practice, these methods will specialize in the years to come:  A plan consists of processes preparing production for the future: purchasing material components and adapting human resources and physical resources. Amazon, for example, has a yearly business plan: putting together the necessary resources in advance in order to be ready for production. This means purchasing or building warehouses, hiring employees, and purchasing basic material resources  boxes, labels, and other components . Scheduling confronts the plan with the time factor on a shorter horizon. Scheduling determines when each part of the plan will come first and be produced. For example, now that the warehouse is built or purchased  plan , at what time  schedule  should the packaging start working next Monday and for the weeks to come?  A schedule can be seen as a zoomed version of a plan.  If somebody walks into Jeff Bezos' office with a plan to build a warehouse at a given location with the cost and general timing of the implementation, that is fine.  Then, that person might  I suggest not!  say: The plan is great since it will be ready in 10 months. But I'm worried about the daily schedule in 1 year of shift 2. Should they start at 7:30 am or 7:45? Jeff Bezos will not be listening anymore. That zoom level is not part of his job description. He has to focus on a higher level.  [ 271 ]   Automated Planning and Scheduling  Chapter 12  The trend of automated planning and scheduling is becoming a time-squashed version of advanced planning and scheduling. The figures in the following table do not reflect the exact numbers but the trends:  Automated planning and scheduling A few days to less than a month 1 minute  Function  Long-term plan   Short-term plan  Production or event measurement  Scheduling Re-planning when there is a problem Re-scheduling Resource adjustment Load balancing Automatic functions of planning and scheduling  Advanced planning and scheduling  1 month to 5 years  1 day Taken into account on a daily basis in general An hour to 1 week 1 hour to 1 month 1 hours to 1 week 1 day to 1 month 1 hour to 1 week  80%  Real-time  Real-time Real-time Real-time Real-time Real-time  99%  Although this table contains approximate information, the underlying trend is extremely strong.   An advanced planning and scheduling system mostly imports data from ERPs to make plans in the future. An automated planning and scheduling program mostly detects data with sensors to react and optimize in real time. The present chapter deals with automated planning programs, not advanced planning and scheduling systems.  Think of the evolution between an advanced APS and an automated APS as a logistic sigmoid function applied to planning-scheduling time squashing. Here are some examples:  The advanced plan to manufacture a car spans a month to a year The Google Maps itinerary automated plan for a self-driving car at its starting point: a few seconds to a minute depending on the connection status of that location The schedule to manufacture a car: 1 day to 1 month The schedule to pilot a self-driving car following the Google Map itineray=real time   [ 272 ]   Automated Planning and Scheduling  Chapter 12  To sum it up, the present trend represents a revolution in the history of human processes.  Amazon's manufacturing patent reflects the revolution of real-time applied to every field.  Planning in advance has moved up to planning in real time as shown in the following equation.  In which:  x is a quantity to produce or any unit event tx is the time  t  it takes for x to start and end A logistic function squashes tx  cid:100   lambda  is the learning factor; the more a task is carried out, the more it is optimized  Xt is the total weight of a group of n tasks at a given time t:  Xt={x1,x2,x3...xn}  The difference between Xt and Z Xt  is:   Xt is the actual time it takes to produce products Z Xt  is not the actual time it takes. Z Xt  is the result of an activation function that squashes times as an output of Xt in a DQN-CRLMM network. Z Xt  is a weighting factor.  The key to reducing the weighting factory further is a physical production process and other physical events  outputs, for example , that I call lambda:  cid:100  all the improvements in real-life production that can reduce the production cycle as well as the natural events such as production output.   [ 273 ]   Automated Planning and Scheduling  Chapter 12  In  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:19 , Conceptual Representation Learning,  cid:99  was introduced to reduce gaps. In this chapter,  cid:99  will be generalized a step further to optimize  cid:100   lambda   This means a DQN-CRLMM system will optimize a manufacturing process.  CRLMM applied to an automated apparel manufacturing process With an automated planning and scheduling system, not an advanced planning and scheduling system, Amazon has brought apparel manufacturing closer to the consumer.   Artificial intelligence will boost existing processes. In this section, a DQN-CRLMM will optimize an apparel manufacturing process.  An apparel manufacturing process Amazon's apparel manufacturing patent can be summed up as follows:  P1: Grouping apparel customer orders by products and sizes. This process is around since the origins of industrial apparel manufacturing centuries ago. P2: Automatically cutting lays  such as cutting a circle in several pieces of paper at the same time .  P3: Moving the packs of the parts of clothing to the assembly lines on conveyor belts  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:19 , Conceptual Representation Learning . P4: Other operations depending on the products  packaging or printing or other . P5: Storing and optimizing the distribution process through warehouses and deliveries and many more processes  tracking and data analysis, for example, finding late deliveries and optimizing their routes .  [ 274 ]   Automated Planning and Scheduling  Chapter 12  The following figure represents the production flow at an apparel manufacturing company. First, the fabric is cut; then it is stacked in piles and sent by a conveyor belt to sewing stations to assemble the clothing:  A webcam is set up right over P3, the conveyor belt. The following image represents the webcam above the conveyor belt:  The webcam freezes a frame  within the red rectangle  every n seconds. The frame is the input of the CRL-CNN described later.  This image is a representation of the concepts. In reality, the webcam might be located at the beginning of the conveyor belt or even over the output of the cutting process. For the purpose of the prototype in this chapter, just keep in mind that every n seconds a frozen frame is sent to the trained CNN.   [ 275 ]   Automated Planning and Scheduling  Chapter 12  This P1 to P5 flowchart provides a general idea of an apparel manufacturing process. In a real-life company, many more processes are required: market studies, designing products, testing prototypes, adding manufacturing processes for jeans  making holes with a laser, for example , and much more.  Every process described so far was individually invented 30+ years ago, including automatic cutting and conveyor belts applied to the apparel business. What's new here? comes up in the minds of many apparel experts reading about Amazon. And that is the mind trap! Thinking that Amazon's apparel patent does not contain new components.  Time squashing is the innovation. Bringing manufacturing closer to the consumer in near- real time is a revolution that will become disruptive. Add 3-D printers to the time squashing equation and you will easily picture the future of our consumer markets. However, artificial intelligence has the right to enter the optimizing competition as well.  To illustrate this, let's build an AI model that optimizes P3, the conveyor belt. Many solutions already exist as well, but DQN can most probably beat them just as it will in many fields.  The first step is to generalize the  cid:99  model described in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:19 , Conceptual Representation Learning, a bit further. Then the DQN-CRLMM can be built.

In the previous, chapters, conceptual subsets around  cid:107   gap concepts  were designed as follows:   cid:99 ={g1,g2,g3,g4,g5,g6} which contains pgi  p=positive  and ngi n=negative subsets  ng1 is a subset of  cid:99 ; ng1={missing, not enough, slowing production down...bad}, pg2 is a subset of  cid:99 ;pg2=pg2={good production flow, no gap} g2={loaded} g3={unloaded}, pg4={traffic jam, heavy traffic...too much traffic} ng5={open lane, light traffic...normal traffic}  [ 276 ]   Automated Planning and Scheduling  Chapter 12   cid:36  cid:47  cid:47  cid:64  cid:52  cid:53  cid:51  cid:34  cid:53  cid:38  cid:40  cid:58  cid:64  cid:46  cid:48  cid:37  cid:38  cid:45  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  needs to be trained to recognize  cid:99  in an apparel production environment as well as remember how to recognize former  cid:99  concepts:  The cutting section P2 A and B  output of apparel packs flowing on a conveyor belt  P3  Remember know how to classify the cakes of the food processing company to teach the model to recognize more situations.

The following frame shows that the first line of production is complete but not lines two and three:  [ 277 ]   Automated Planning and Scheduling  Chapter 12  On the contrary, with approximately no gaps, the load on the conveyor built was viewed as positive, a positive gamma= p cid:101 .  The following frame shows that there is an acceptable number of products per line:   cid:34  cid:81  cid:81  cid:66  cid:83  cid:70  cid:77  cid:2  cid:68  cid:80  cid:79  cid:87  cid:70  cid:90  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:67  cid:70  cid:77  cid:85  cid:2  cid:81  cid:83  cid:80  cid:68  cid:70  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:97  cid:2  cid:86  cid:79  cid:69  cid:70  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:78  cid:74  cid:79  cid:70  cid:69  cid:2  cid:72  cid:66  cid:81  cid:84  A gap in an apparel conveyor belt process is most often undetermined. This constitutes a major optimization problem in itself. Naturally, if the conveyor belt is empty or totally saturated, the variance will attract the attention of a human operator. However, most of the time, optimization solves the problem.  The following frame shows a relatively well-loaded production flow of apparel packs of pieces of clothing to be assembled  by sewing them together  further down the line:  [ 278 ]   Automated Planning and Scheduling  Chapter 12  The following frame clearly shows a gap, meaning that the quantity that will be sent to a sewing station will not be high:  Several observations are necessary to optimize this problem:   The conveyor built real-time problem excludes running an advanced planning and scheduling This problem requires real-time automated planning and scheduling The automated planning and scheduling solution will have to both plan and schedule in real time It will take planning constraints into account  as explained in the following sections  to predict outputs  It will take scheduling constraints into account to optimize the sewing sections  Amazon and others have slowly but surely brought many planning horizon problems  longer  down to shorter scheduling horizons, pushing the limits of SCM further and further.   cid:53  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:67  cid:70  cid:72  cid:74  cid:79  cid:79  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:80  cid:71  cid:2  cid:66  cid:79  cid:2  cid:66  cid:67  cid:84  cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:68  cid:85  cid:2  cid:79  cid:80  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:80  cid:71  cid:2  cid:72  cid:66  cid:81  cid:84  The gaps shown have negative or positive properties depending on the context. The CRLMM model now has to learn a metaconcept, an abstract representation of all the gaps mentioned up to now. These gaps are all flow gaps of one sort or the other. Something is moving from one point to another in small packs. The packs, so are often not the same size and gaps form.  [ 279 ]   Automated Planning and Scheduling  Chapter 12  These concepts can be applied to cattle herds, horse races, team sports attacks  football, soccer, rugby, basketball, handball, and other fields , Olympic races, marathons, conveyor belts, and much more, as will be detailed in the chatbot in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:23 , Cognitive NLP Chatbots, and  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:24 , Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots.  When the packs in the flow are close to each other, an individual mental image comes up. Each person has a customized version. The following image is a generalized representation of a no gap concept:  Then the packs have leaders and followers, then an abstract representation comes up as well. The following image shows a generalized representation of a gap concept:  Humans do not have a flow detection gap function for each thing they are observing. Humans have one brain that contains physical memories or other datasets, but more importantly, they have abstract datasets.  Every single of us billions of thinking bipeds have extremely efficient abstract datasets. The meta-concept shown before means that through inferences, a human has a central meta- concept with a dataset of memories that fit with it through experience.  [ 280 ]   Automated Planning and Scheduling  Chapter 12  A meta-model uses these datasets. The dataset in the directory "dataset" contains the beginning of a CRLMM system. The program will learn what a flow gap is and then apply to what it sees by analyzing the context.  This goal of this dataset leads to a CLR-MM, as explained in the following sections in which:  The abstract learned meta-concept is applied to a situation, in this case, a frame. The CRLMM then determines whether it is a gap or no gap situation. The CRLMM then makes a decision using a thinking optimizer based on a decision weight orientated activation function. This means that it is more than a mathematical squash. It's literally weighing the pros and cons of a decision-making process.   To apply this model in real life, the next step would be to spend the necessary time to build a dataset from experience with thousands upon thousands of frames. This would take months of painful work.  Modifying the hyperparameters The training was done with the same  cid:36  cid:47  cid:47  cid:64  cid:52  cid:53  cid:51  cid:34  cid:53  cid:38  cid:40  cid:58  cid:64  cid:46  cid:48  cid:37  cid:38  cid:45  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  program described in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:27 , Getting Your Neurons to Work, which was designed to be generalized for subsequent chapters.  Once the dataset of the previous section has been installed, there are only two hyperparameters to change in the following code snippet:   cid:70  cid:84  cid:85  cid:70  cid:81  cid:31  cid:23  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18  cid:2  cid:5  cid:23  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18  cid:2  cid:84  cid:85  cid:70  cid:81  cid:84  cid:2  cid:81  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:70  cid:81  cid:80  cid:68  cid:73   cid:16  cid:16  cid:16   cid:70  cid:81  cid:31  cid:21  cid:2  cid:5  cid:70  cid:81  cid:80  cid:68  cid:73  cid:84   This forces the program to train longer:  Three epochs:  cid:70  cid:81  cid:31  cid:21  5,000 steps per epoch:  cid:70  cid:84  cid:85  cid:70  cid:81  cid:31  cid:23  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18   [ 281 ]   Automated Planning and Scheduling  Chapter 12  As the code that follows shows, the hyperparameters have been modified; the program runs and the new model is saved with its graph flow structure and weights:   cid:5  cid:2  cid:84  cid:70  cid:83  cid:74  cid:66  cid:77  cid:74  cid:91  cid:70  cid:2  cid:78  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:77  cid:2  cid:85  cid:80  cid:2  cid:43  cid:52  cid:48  cid:47   cid:78  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:77  cid:64  cid:75  cid:84  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:74  cid:70  cid:83  cid:16  cid:85  cid:80  cid:64  cid:75  cid:84  cid:80  cid:79  cid:10  cid:11   cid:88  cid:74  cid:85  cid:73  cid:2  cid:80  cid:81  cid:70  cid:79  cid:10  cid:69  cid:74  cid:83  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:80  cid:83  cid:90  cid:13  cid:4  cid:78  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:77  cid:17  cid:78  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:77  cid:16  cid:75  cid:84  cid:80  cid:79  cid:4  cid:14  cid:2  cid:4  cid:88  cid:4  cid:11  cid:2  cid:66  cid:84  cid:2  cid:75  cid:84  cid:80  cid:79  cid:64  cid:71  cid:74  cid:77  cid:70  cid:28   cid:2  cid:75  cid:84  cid:80  cid:79  cid:64  cid:71  cid:74  cid:77  cid:70  cid:16  cid:88  cid:83  cid:74  cid:85  cid:70  cid:10  cid:78  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:77  cid:64  cid:75  cid:84  cid:80  cid:79  cid:11   cid:5  cid:2  cid:84  cid:70  cid:83  cid:74  cid:66  cid:77  cid:74  cid:91  cid:70  cid:2  cid:88  cid:70  cid:74  cid:72  cid:73  cid:85  cid:84  cid:2  cid:85  cid:80  cid:2  cid:41  cid:37  cid:39  cid:23   cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:74  cid:70  cid:83  cid:16  cid:84  cid:66  cid:87  cid:70  cid:64  cid:88  cid:70  cid:74  cid:72  cid:73  cid:85  cid:84  cid:10  cid:69  cid:74  cid:83  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:80  cid:83  cid:90  cid:13  cid:4  cid:78  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:77  cid:17  cid:78  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:77  cid:16  cid:73  cid:23  cid:4  cid:11   The model has been trained to deal with a meta-concept. It now needs to go through a prediction program to check the network.

However, some new features were added to make this prediction testing phase comfortable to use and watch.   The model is loaded and compiled as described in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:19 , Conceptual Representation Learning.

However, instead of showing the pre-processed image and having to click on it to close the window, a matplotlib  cid:81  cid:77  cid:85  cid:16  cid:68  cid:77  cid:80  cid:84  cid:70  function was added, as in the following code:   cid:2  cid:74  cid:71  cid:10  cid:69  cid:74  cid:84  cid:81  cid:77  cid:66  cid:90  cid:31  cid:31  cid:19  cid:11  cid:28   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:81  cid:77  cid:85  cid:16  cid:74  cid:78  cid:84  cid:73  cid:80  cid:88  cid:10  cid:80  cid:83  cid:74  cid:72  cid:74  cid:79  cid:66  cid:77  cid:11   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:81  cid:77  cid:85  cid:16  cid:84  cid:73  cid:80  cid:88  cid:10  cid:67  cid:77  cid:80  cid:68  cid:76  cid:31  cid:39  cid:66  cid:77  cid:84  cid:70  cid:11   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:85  cid:74  cid:78  cid:70  cid:16  cid:84  cid:77  cid:70  cid:70  cid:81  cid:10  cid:23  cid:11   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:81  cid:77  cid:85  cid:16  cid:68  cid:77  cid:80  cid:84  cid:70  cid:10  cid:11    cid:69  cid:74  cid:84  cid:81  cid:77  cid:66  cid:90  is a variable that can be set to  cid:18 . In that case, no image will be displayed. However, when developing convolutional networks, displaying images remains a practical way of testing the program.  The image will be displayed for  cid:23  seconds and automatically closed. To keep things automatic, the four frames and two meta-concepts run in a loop as in the code that follows:   cid:42  cid:31  cid:60  cid:9  cid:19  cid:9  cid:14  cid:9  cid:20  cid:9  cid:14  cid:9  cid:21  cid:9  cid:14  cid:9  cid:22  cid:9  cid:14  cid:9  cid:23  cid:9  cid:14  cid:9  cid:24  cid:9  cid:62   cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:74  cid:78  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:72  cid:70  cid:10  cid:24  cid:11  cid:28   cid:74  cid:78  cid:72  cid:68  cid:31  cid:69  cid:74  cid:83  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:80  cid:83  cid:90  cid:13  cid:9  cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:90  cid:17  cid:74  cid:78  cid:72  cid:9  cid:13  cid:2  cid:42  cid:60  cid:74  cid:78  cid:62  cid:2  cid:13  cid:2  cid:9  cid:16  cid:75  cid:81  cid:72  cid:9   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:74  cid:78  cid:72  cid:68  cid:11   cid:84  cid:31  cid:74  cid:69  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:74  cid:71  cid:90  cid:10  cid:74  cid:78  cid:72  cid:68  cid:11   cid:74  cid:71  cid:2  cid:10  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:84  cid:11  cid:31  cid:31  cid:18  cid:11  cid:28   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:9  cid:36  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:74  cid:70  cid:69  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:2  cid:34  cid:9  cid:11   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:46  cid:52  cid:19  cid:11   [ 282 ]   Automated Planning and Scheduling  Chapter 12   cid:74  cid:71  cid:2  cid:10  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:84  cid:11  cid:31  cid:31  cid:19  cid:11  cid:28   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:9  cid:36  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:74  cid:70  cid:69  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:2  cid:35  cid:9  cid:11   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:46  cid:52  cid:20  cid:11   The predictions come out as  cid:18  with an  cid:46  cid:52  cid:19  message or  cid:19  with an  cid:46  cid:52  cid:20  message. The messages can be changed or come from a message dataset depending on the goal of the program. The program will then display the classification, as follows:   cid:5  cid:64  cid:52  cid:38  cid:34  cid:51  cid:36  cid:41  cid:2  cid:52  cid:53  cid:51  cid:34  cid:53  cid:38  cid:40  cid:58  cid:64   cid:46  cid:52  cid:19  cid:31  cid:9  cid:79  cid:80  cid:2  cid:72  cid:66  cid:81  cid:9   cid:46  cid:52  cid:20  cid:31  cid:9  cid:72  cid:66  cid:81  cid:9   The CRLMM has now learned to represent real-life memories and an inference of the associated memories in a meta-concept.  Building the DQN-CRLMM The full code of the DQN-CRLMM program is  cid:46  cid:37  cid:49  cid:64  cid:40  cid:83  cid:66  cid:81  cid:73  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90 . It is built on the knowledge and programs of the previous chapters and previous sections of this chapter.  The DQN-CRLMM contains three components:  A CRLMM convolutional network that will analyze each frame it receives from the webcam that is located right over the pieces of garment packs on the conveyor belt coming from the cutting section.  An optimizer using a modified version of the Z X  described before that plans how the assembly stations will be loaded in real-time. An MDP that will receive the input of the optimizer function and schedule the work of the assembly stations. It also produces the modified Z X  updated value of the weights of each assembly station for the next frame.  In the physical world, the conveyor belt transports the garment packs, a picture  frame  is taken every n seconds, and the DQN-CRL-MN runs. The output of the DQN-CRL-MN sends instructions to the conveyor belt and directs the garment backs to the optimized load of the assembly stations as explained before.  Since  cid:46  cid:49  cid:49  cid:64  cid:72  cid:83  cid:66  cid:81  cid:73  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  describes a continuous DQN-CRLMM process, there is no beginning or end to the program. The components are independent and are triggered by the input sent to them and they trigger others with their output.  [ 283 ]   Automated Planning and Scheduling  Chapter 12  Thus, components will be described in the processing order but not in the code-in-line order. This is due to the fact that the functions defined by def + function   precede the function calls to them. Code line numbers will thus be inserted in the description of the code.   cid:21  cid:26  cid:28  is the code line number. It is not in the actual code but only given in the book to find the functions. The code is complete and you can view the line numbers in an editor.  A circular process Once the three main components of the system are explained later  CNN, MDP, optimizer ; the circular property of this DQN-CRLMM is a stream-like system that never starts nor ends.   There is no beginning and no end to the flow of functions in this virtually memoryless system.  The conveyor belt's webcam provides a stream of frames, forcing the system into  circular stream-like behavior.   Implementing a CNN-CRLMM to detect gaps and optimize The CNN-CRLMM function was described in the Running a prediction program section and in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:19 , Conceptual Representation Learning. The prediction function is part of the MDP output analysis described later. The  cid:36  cid:51  cid:45  cid:46  cid:46  function is called as shown in the following code:   cid:19  cid:26  cid:18  cid:28  cid:2  cid:69  cid:70  cid:71  cid:2  cid:36  cid:51  cid:45  cid:46  cid:46  cid:10  cid:50  cid:14  cid:77  cid:83  cid:14  cid:70  cid:11  cid:28   The first part of this function squashes the  cid:56  vector described in the following section. The second part of this function analyzes the input frame.  [ 284 ]   Automated Planning and Scheduling  Chapter 12  Since no webcam is connected to the system at this point  that must be done during project implementation , a random image  frame  choice is made. The following random code simulates the random occurrences of real-life production:   cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:86  cid:84  cid:31  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:80  cid:78  cid:16  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:11   In a real-life situation, random quantities will be going through the conveyor belt. Status being determined, the CNN simulates adding a frozen frame from the video stream coming from the webcam located right on the conveyor belt.

This will be done with the MDP.  Q-Learning  cid:97  MDP  By adding an MDP Q-Learning decision function  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19 , Become an Adaptive Thinker  in this CNN-CRLMM program, we are now entering the family of DQNs, such as Google's DeepMind programs.   In this real-time system, there is no beginning, no end, and no real memory beyond a few frames.   [ 285 ]   Automated Planning and Scheduling  Chapter 12  The  cid:46  cid:37  cid:49  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  MDP program has been incorporated into  cid:46  cid:37  cid:49  cid:64  cid:40  cid:83  cid:66  cid:81  cid:73  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90 . Thus, only the changes made are described in this chapter.  MDP parameters come right after the import packages. Each vertex of the graph has its own letter and its own location, as shown in the following code snippet:   cid:2  cid:21  cid:26  cid:28  cid:45  cid:31  cid:60  cid:9  cid:34  cid:9  cid:14  cid:9  cid:35  cid:9  cid:14  cid:9  cid:36  cid:9  cid:14  cid:9  cid:37  cid:9  cid:14  cid:9  cid:38  cid:9  cid:14  cid:9  cid:39  cid:9  cid:62   When the program runs, the following graph will be displayed with red  target vertices  for this frame. It is then up to the MDP to choose, as described as follows:  Notice that this is an undirected graph with vertices  the colored dots  and no edge  lines  directions. The MDP will provide directions for each frame in this model.  Each vertex represents an assembly station in this model. Each assembly station has a high workload or a low workload. The workload is rarely stabilized because products keep flowing in and out as they are produced.  MDP inputs and outputs The MDP process in this model uses a reward matrix as an input and produces a weight vector.   cid:53  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:81  cid:86  cid:85  cid:2  cid:74  cid:84  cid:2  cid:66  cid:2  cid:79  cid:70  cid:86  cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:77  cid:2  cid:83  cid:70  cid:88  cid:66  cid:83  cid:69  cid:2  cid:78  cid:66  cid:85  cid:83  cid:74  cid:89  The MDP reward matrix  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19 , Become an Adaptive Thinker  is set to zero except for the values representing the edges of the graph that can be physically accessed; these are set to one, a small neutral value.  [ 286 ]   Automated Planning and Scheduling  Chapter 12  As it is, the MDP cannot provide a satisfactory result beyond reproducing the structure of this undirected graph. The reward matrix is now initialized and duplicated as shown in the following code, starting from line  cid:22  cid:19 ; at line  cid:22  cid:21 ,   cid:51 ,  the reward matrix is built,  and at line  cid:23  cid:18 ,  cid:51  cid:74 , a duplicate of R is created:   cid:22  cid:19  cid:28  cid:5  cid:2  cid:51  cid:2  cid:74  cid:84  cid:2  cid:53  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:51  cid:70  cid:88  cid:66  cid:83  cid:69  cid:2  cid:46  cid:66  cid:85  cid:83  cid:74  cid:89  cid:2  cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:70  cid:66  cid:68  cid:73  cid:2  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70  cid:2  cid:67  cid:86  cid:74  cid:77  cid:85  cid:2  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:81  cid:73  cid:90  cid:84  cid:74  cid:68  cid:66  cid:77  cid:2  cid:72  cid:83  cid:66  cid:81  cid:73   cid:5  cid:2  cid:51  cid:74  cid:2  cid:74  cid:84  cid:2  cid:66  cid:2  cid:78  cid:70  cid:78  cid:80  cid:83  cid:90  cid:2  cid:80  cid:71  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:74  cid:84  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:74  cid:85  cid:74  cid:66  cid:77  cid:2  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70  cid:28  cid:2  cid:79  cid:80  cid:2  cid:83  cid:70  cid:88  cid:66  cid:83  cid:69  cid:84  cid:2  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:2  cid:86  cid:79  cid:69  cid:74  cid:83  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:70  cid:69    cid:22  cid:21  cid:28  cid:51  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:82  cid:77  cid:16  cid:78  cid:66  cid:85  cid:83  cid:74  cid:89  cid:10  cid:60  cid:2  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14   cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:62  cid:14   cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14   cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14   cid:60  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14   cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:2  cid:62  cid:11    cid:23  cid:18  cid:28  cid:51  cid:74  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:82  cid:77  cid:16  cid:78  cid:66  cid:85  cid:83  cid:74  cid:89  cid:10  cid:60  cid:2  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14   cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:62  cid:14   cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14   cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14   cid:60  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:14   cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62  cid:2  cid:62  cid:11    cid:51  cid:74 , on line  cid:23  cid:18 , is a copy of the initial-state zero-reward matrix.  cid:51  is reset to  cid:51  cid:74  at every new frame. MDP trains the assembly location plan for each new frame in a memoryless, undirected graph and unsupervised approach.  cid:50  is the learning matrix in which rewards will be learned stored, as shown in the code on line  cid:23  cid:27 :   cid:23  cid:27  cid:28  cid:50  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:82  cid:77  cid:16  cid:78  cid:66  cid:85  cid:83  cid:74  cid:89  cid:10  cid:82  cid:77  cid:16  cid:91  cid:70  cid:83  cid:80  cid:84  cid:10  cid:60  cid:24  cid:14  cid:24  cid:62  cid:11  cid:11    cid:53  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:66  cid:83  cid:69  cid:2  cid:80  cid:86  cid:85  cid:81  cid:86  cid:85  cid:2  cid:80  cid:71  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:46  cid:37  cid:49  cid:2  cid:71  cid:86  cid:79  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  The load of the assembly stations is not the exact quantities produced. They are weights that are updated continuously during this continuous process as explained further in the chapter.  At an initial state of the program, the initial weight of the vertices is set to  cid:18  in the following line of code  line  cid:22  cid:18  :   cid:22  cid:18  cid:28  cid:56  cid:31  cid:60  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:14  cid:18  cid:62   [ 287 ]   Automated Planning and Scheduling  Chapter 12  The weight vector  represented as an array  contains one value per assembly station location or vertex.  An initial state is not a real beginning. It is like a pause button on a video. The initial state can come from a holiday  no production , a maintenance day  no production , or a lack of input orders  no production . The initial state is just a case when the weights are equal to  cid:18  because there is nothing on the conveyor or assembly stations.   The weight vector is part 1 of the optimizer  see the following section . The MDP produces an output matrix  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19 , Become an Adaptive Thinker  after having optimized the undirected graph.

It is a weight, just as in any other network. The difference is that the whole system is controlled. In a real-life project, keeping an eye on the calculations through reports is necessary for maintenance purposes. Even an automatic system requires quality control.  The MDP matrix has now been flattened into a weight matrix, as shown in the following output:   cid:55  cid:70  cid:83  cid:85  cid:74  cid:68  cid:70  cid:2  cid:56  cid:70  cid:74  cid:72  cid:73  cid:85  cid:84  cid:2  cid:60  cid:21  cid:16  cid:23  cid:14  cid:2  cid:21  cid:16  cid:23  cid:14  cid:2  cid:21  cid:16  cid:18  cid:14  cid:2  cid:23  cid:16  cid:18  cid:14  cid:2  cid:21  cid:16  cid:23  cid:14  cid:2  cid:21  cid:16  cid:23  cid:62   Each vertex  letter in the graph  now has a weight.   cid:42  cid:78  cid:81  cid:77  cid:70  cid:78  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:59  cid:2  cid:97  cid:2  cid:84  cid:82  cid:86  cid:66  cid:84  cid:73  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:87  cid:70  cid:83  cid:85  cid:70  cid:89  cid:2  cid:88  cid:70  cid:74  cid:72  cid:73  cid:85  cid:84  cid:2  cid:87  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:80  cid:83  Squashed W  vertex weights  grow after each frame analysis and each MDP run since W[j]+ is applied continuously and W is never set to zero.  The main reasons:  Once launched, the DQN-CRLMM is a continuous process, with no beginning and no end as long as the conveyor belt is running The conveyor belt is sending assembly  mostly sewing  work to the assembly stations that take some time  t  to get the job  x  represented by tx in the Z equation and the W vector in the program So work is piling up on each vertex  A to F , which represents an assembly station  This is why the  cid:100   lambda  variable in the Z equation is implemented as shown in the initial equation early in the chapter, as follows:  [ 291 ]   Automated Planning and Scheduling  Chapter 12   cid:100   lambda  is implemented for two reasons:  The sewing or assembly stations send their finished work to the next operation on the production line, packaging for example. So every m minutes, their workload goes down and so does the load feature weight. Production managers are constantly working on learning curves on assembly lines. When a new product arrives, it takes some time for the teams to adapt. Their output is a bit slower than usual. However, well-trained teams bring the learning period down regularly.    cid:100   lambda  combines both concepts in one variable. This might be enough for some projects. If not, more work and variables need to be added.  In this model,  cid:100   lambda  is activated by the following:   cid:80  cid:74  cid:71  represents the frequency of a  cid:56  vector  cid:100  update. In this example,  cid:80  cid:74  cid:71  is set to  cid:19  cid:18 . This means that every  cid:19  cid:18  frames,  cid:80  cid:74  cid:83  will be applied.  cid:80  cid:74  cid:83  represents the output rate for the two reasons described before.

of n frames. This means that in every n frames, it's memory is emptied of useless information.  The goal of the optimizer is to provide a target for the MDP function. On the first episode, since it does not have any information, the optimizer selects a random state, as shown in the following code excerpt:   cid:5  cid:71  cid:74  cid:83  cid:84  cid:85  cid:2  cid:70  cid:81  cid:74  cid:84  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:2  cid:74  cid:84  cid:2  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:80  cid:78   cid:74  cid:71  cid:10  cid:70  cid:31  cid:31  cid:18  cid:11  cid:28   cid:77  cid:83  cid:31  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:80  cid:78  cid:16  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:18  cid:14  cid:23  cid:11   This means that a random assembly station will be chosen on the MPD graph, which represents the six assembly sewing stations. Once this episode has been completed, the system enters a circular real-time cycle  see next section .  The second episode has the  cid:56  vector to rely upon.  It runs the  cid:68  cid:83  cid:77  cid:78  cid:78   described before  CNN-CRLMM network to determine whether the frame has a gap or no gap feature as shown in the following code:   cid:21  cid:26  cid:21  cid:28  cid:68  cid:83  cid:77  cid:78  cid:78  cid:31  cid:36  cid:51  cid:45  cid:46  cid:46  cid:10  cid:50  cid:14  cid:77  cid:83  cid:14  cid:70  cid:11   The optimizer will use  cid:56  to:  Choose the vertex  sewing station  with somewhat the smallest weight if the CNN on the frame produces a result with  cid:79  cid:80  cid:2  cid:72  cid:66  cid:81   probability is zero . Since there is no gap that means that there are many pieces to sew. Thus, it is much better to give the work to an assembly station that has a lower load than others.  [ 293 ]   Automated Planning and Scheduling  Chapter 12  Choose the vertex  sewing station  with somewhat the highest weight if the CNN on the frame produces a result with a  cid:72  cid:66  cid:81   probability is one . Since there is a gap, it means there are not that many pieces to sew. Thus it is much better to give the work to an assembly station that already has a higher workload. It will balance the loads and optimize the load distribution over all the stations. Introduce a choice to find one target assembly station for the MDP function in each of these cases. It will look for stations  vertices, letters, dots in the graph  with the highest weight in one case and the lowest in another.  Add the somewhat concept referred to before. The system must remain relatively free or it will keep choosing the same best sewing stations, depriving others of work. Thus each possibility   cid:72  cid:66  cid:81  or  cid:79  cid:80  cid:2  cid:72  cid:66  cid:81   is limited to a random choice of only three among the six locations for each weight class  higher or lower .  The optimizing function, shown in the following snippet, can prove extremely profitable on real-life industrial production lines:   cid:74  cid:71  cid:10  cid:70  cid:32  cid:18  cid:11  cid:28   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:77  cid:83  cid:31  cid:18   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:78  cid:74  cid:79  cid:88  cid:31  cid:19  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:78  cid:66  cid:89  cid:88  cid:31  cid:15  cid:19   cid:5  cid:79  cid:80  cid:2  cid:40  cid:2  cid:31  cid:32  cid:2  cid:39  cid:74  cid:79  cid:69  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:77  cid:66  cid:83  cid:72  cid:70  cid:84  cid:85  cid:2  cid:72  cid:66  cid:81  cid:2  cid:10  cid:78  cid:80  cid:84  cid:85  cid:2  cid:77  cid:80  cid:66  cid:69  cid:70  cid:69  cid:2  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:80  cid:86  cid:83  cid:68  cid:70  cid:2  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:66  cid:2  cid:69  cid:74  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:79  cid:68  cid:70  cid:11   cid:74  cid:71  cid:10  cid:68  cid:83  cid:77  cid:78  cid:78  cid:31  cid:31  cid:18  cid:11  cid:28   cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:88  cid:74  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:72  cid:70  cid:10  cid:21  cid:11  cid:28   cid:80  cid:81  cid:31  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:80  cid:78  cid:16  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:18  cid:14  cid:23  cid:11   cid:74  cid:71  cid:10  cid:56  cid:60  cid:80  cid:81  cid:62  cid:30  cid:78  cid:74  cid:79  cid:88  cid:11  cid:28   cid:77  cid:83  cid:31  cid:80  cid:81  cid:29  cid:78  cid:74  cid:79  cid:88  cid:31  cid:56  cid:60  cid:80  cid:81  cid:62   cid:5  cid:40  cid:2  cid:31  cid:32  cid:2  cid:39  cid:74  cid:79  cid:69  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:84  cid:78  cid:66  cid:77  cid:77  cid:70  cid:84  cid:85  cid:2  cid:72  cid:66  cid:81  cid:2  cid:10  cid:66  cid:2  cid:77  cid:70  cid:66  cid:84  cid:85  cid:2  cid:77  cid:80  cid:66  cid:69  cid:70  cid:69  cid:2  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:80  cid:86  cid:83  cid:68  cid:70  cid:2  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:66  cid:2  cid:69  cid:74  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:79  cid:68  cid:70  cid:11   cid:74  cid:71  cid:10  cid:68  cid:83  cid:77  cid:78  cid:78  cid:31  cid:31  cid:19  cid:11  cid:28   cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:88  cid:74  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:72  cid:70  cid:10  cid:21  cid:11  cid:28   cid:80  cid:81  cid:31  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:80  cid:78  cid:16  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:18  cid:14  cid:23  cid:11   cid:74  cid:71  cid:10  cid:56  cid:60  cid:80  cid:81  cid:62  cid:32  cid:78  cid:66  cid:89  cid:88  cid:11  cid:28   cid:77  cid:83  cid:31  cid:80  cid:81  cid:29  cid:78  cid:66  cid:89  cid:88  cid:31  cid:56  cid:60  cid:80  cid:81  cid:62    cid:77  cid:83  is the main location chosen for the MDP reinforcement learning function, as shown in the following code:   cid:2  cid:2  cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:4  cid:45  cid:51  cid:2  cid:53  cid:34  cid:51  cid:40  cid:38  cid:53  cid:2  cid:52  cid:53  cid:34  cid:53  cid:38  cid:2  cid:46  cid:37  cid:49  cid:2  cid:79  cid:86  cid:78  cid:67  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:2  cid:77  cid:70  cid:85  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:28  cid:4  cid:14  cid:77  cid:83  cid:14  cid:45  cid:60  cid:77  cid:83  cid:62  cid:11   Reinforcement learning has to run every time since it faces new frames in the continuous process of the conveyor belt in the automated apparel system.

[ 298 ]   Automated Planning and Scheduling  Chapter 12   STEP X+2 the MDP, as described in this chapter, receives instructions to optimize a given sewing station and spreads work out to its neighbors. This is often a production constraint: one station sews the sleeves of a t-shirt. For example, the station nearby sews a pocket on the t-shirt. The MDP spreads out the work starting with the target location, as shown in the  following graph:  The MDP sends its results directly to the conveyor belt, which automatically follows the path instructions sent to it.  Then the MDP updates the weights, empties its reward matrix, and waits for a new one. The system goes back to Step X.  As you might have noticed, no human operator is involved in this whole process at all.

[ 299 ]   Automated Planning and Scheduling  Chapter 12  Summary Applying artificial intelligence to Amazon's real-time sales, production, and delivery forces projects into reality.  Learning machine learning and deep learning with MNIST, CIFAR, and other ready-to-use datasets with ready-to-use programs is a prerequisite to mastering artificial intelligence. Learning mathematics is a must.  Building a few programs that can do various theoretical things cannot be avoided. But managing a real project under corporate pressure will bring an AI expert up to another level. The constraints of corporate specifications make machine learning projects exciting. During those projects, experts learn valuable information on how AI solutions work and can be improved.  This chapter described a DQN-CRLMM-CNN model with an optimizer and an MDP function. The next chapter explores an application of this solution with an SVM applied to a self-driving car situation in an IoT context.   Questions  1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.

I think we should wait a few years until the smoke clears and let historians figure out what sort of revolution we went through.  In any case, connected objects have been changing our lives for 20+ years. In the past years, we can safely say that IoT has become disruptive.  Artificial intelligence has just begun its long journey through the human intellect. New, incredible innovations await us. Understand cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning theory is only the beginning of your adventure. The knowledge you have acquired should help you become an AI visionary. Take everything you see seriously and see how it can fit in your projects.  Your mind must remain open to what may seem the strangest things to come. For example, conceptual representation learning  see previous chapters  will bring new dimensions to a machine's thinking mind.  This chapter takes the technology of the previous chapter and applies it to a self-driving car working for the mayor's office in a city called Iotham City. The previous chapter used a webcam and a program and sent instructions to the conveyor belt. It was in the family of IoT. Let's add a support vector machine to the program and take it out on the streets of Iotham City to see what happens.

The self-driving car can be started at a distance and goes to homes and takes the goods to the shelters. The self-driving car does not need to have a base. It can park anywhere, go anywhere, and refuel at service stations with automatic electric recharging.  Some IoT projects plan to put sensors on every parking space and send the information to control centers. Iotham City finds that too expensive. Instead, the city council has decided to use a more cost-effective solution. A webcam will be installed on all the possible parking lots in the project's grid. This smart grid is for transporting products from homes to shelters.  The model in this chapter can start at any point. This is circular, as described in the previous chapter. Our scenario starts after the self-driving car has just delivered clothing to a shelter. Now the self-driving vehicle has to find a parking lot to park in until its next mission.  Setting up the DQN-CRLMM model This section describes how to set up the previous chapter's model for this project and add a few functions.  A DQN-CRLMM model contains a convolutional neural network  CNN  and a Markov Decision Process  MDP  linked together by an optimizer.  A conceptual representation learning meta-model contains:  A CNN An optimizer linking it to an MDP An MDP function  This system will now be referred to as a CRLMM.  [ 303 ]   AI and the Internet of Things  IoT   Chapter 13  Training the CRLMM In previous chapters, the CRLMM program  cid:36  cid:47  cid:47  cid:64  cid:52  cid:53  cid:51  cid:34  cid:53  cid:38  cid:40  cid:58  cid:64  cid:46  cid:48  cid:37  cid:38  cid:45  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  was trained to identify  cid:98   gamma concept  in outputs on the conveyor belt of a food processing factory. The end of the previous chapter brought  cid:98  up to a higher abstraction level. As long as a member of  cid:108   gamma  of the  cid:98  dataset is in an undetermined state, its generalization encompasses ambivalent but similar concepts. Up to this chapter, these are the concepts  cid:98  has learned  conceptual representation learning .    cid:99  = { a gap, no gap, a load, no load, not enough load, enough load, too much load, a space on a lane for a car, a distance between a high load of products and missing products on a conveyor belt, weights on sewing stations...n}  The next step in the chapter is to train the CRLMM built in the previous chapters to recognize a parking space in a parking lot and send a signal to the self-driving vehicle:   cid:98  will now see gaps as space  cid:98  will now perceive space as a distance  gap  between two objects  cid:98  will need a context to find out whether this space between two objects is a positive or negative distance  The dataset As in the previous chapters, the  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:84  cid:70  cid:85  directory of this chapter on GitHub contains:  The training set The test set The model trained by  cid:18  cid:19  cid:64  cid:36  cid:47  cid:47  cid:64  cid:52  cid:53  cid:51  cid:34  cid:53  cid:38  cid:40  cid:58  cid:64  cid:46  cid:48  cid:37  cid:38  cid:45  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  The  cid:68  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:90  directory used by  cid:18  cid:19  cid:64  cid:36  cid:47  cid:47  cid:64  cid:52  cid:53  cid:51  cid:34  cid:53  cid:38  cid:40  cid:58  cid:64  cid:46  cid:48  cid:37  cid:38  cid:45  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90   As explained in the previous chapters, a full dataset would take weeks, if not months, to prepare. They are projects in themselves. For this example,  cid:98  has evolved into space  gap detection between  distance   cars to find a parking space.  [ 304 ]   AI and the Internet of Things  IoT   Chapter 13  The following is a simulated frozen frame with no  cid:98 -space taken by a webcam located on a building, pointing down to a parking lot:  The following frame represents a small but sufficient parking space on the left of the screen. I copied the pavement over it to free the  cid:98 -space. It shows something like several available parking spaces:  Training and testing the model The model was trained by using the same  cid:18  cid:19  cid:64  cid:36  cid:47  cid:47  cid:64  cid:52  cid:53  cid:51  cid:34  cid:53  cid:38  cid:40  cid:58  cid:64  cid:46  cid:48  cid:37  cid:38  cid:45  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  program as in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:27 , Getting Your Neurons to Work.

To test the model, the  cid:36  cid:47  cid:47  cid:64  cid:52  cid:53  cid:51  cid:34  cid:53  cid:38  cid:40  cid:58  cid:64  cid:46  cid:48  cid:37  cid:38  cid:45  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  improved in the previous chapter was used. Just change the messages and limit the frame classification loop to  cid:20  as shown in the following code snippet:   cid:46  cid:52  cid:19  cid:31  cid:9  cid:71  cid:86  cid:77  cid:77  cid:9   cid:46  cid:52  cid:20  cid:31  cid:9  cid:84  cid:81  cid:66  cid:68  cid:70  cid:9   cid:42  cid:31  cid:60  cid:9  cid:19  cid:9  cid:14  cid:9  cid:20  cid:9  cid:14  cid:9  cid:21  cid:9  cid:14  cid:9  cid:22  cid:9  cid:14  cid:9  cid:23  cid:9  cid:14  cid:9  cid:24  cid:9  cid:62   cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:74  cid:78  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:72  cid:70  cid:10  cid:20  cid:11  cid:28   The following loaded image was already resized before applying the kernels of the CNN:   cid:36  cid:77  cid:66  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:71  cid:90  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:81  cid:66  cid:83  cid:76  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:77  cid:80  cid:85  cid:84  Now that the CRLMM has been trained to distinguish a full parking lot from a parking lot with available space, once an available parking lot has been found, an SVM takes over as an intermediate step.  Adding an SVM function The self-driving car has delivered its packages to the shelters. Now it has to find a parking lot and park there. Instead of having a base like many other systems, this saves Iotham City many useless trips.  [ 306 ]   AI and the Internet of Things  IoT  Motivation  cid:97  using an SVM to increase safety levels The support vector system adds a new function to itinerary calculations cid:100 safety.  Chapter 13  Most systems such as Google Maps focus on:  Shortest trip Fastest trip Traffic  However, self-driving cars have to take extra precautions. In fact, many humans do not feel secure on some roads. Iotham City has a good management policy. Safety will come first, no matter what. Once a suitable parking lot has been found, the SVM has to avoid traffic.  The goal is to find a path through traffic even if the distance is longer. A p parameter allows for a p% variance of the distance. For example, 10% allows a 10% longer distance and will provide a safe passage, as shown in the following SVM result:  It is important to note that the data points are not the actual coordinates but a representation in a higher dimension, as explained in the following section.   [ 307 ]   AI and the Internet of Things  IoT   Chapter 13  Definition of a support vector machine A support vector machine  SVM  classifies data by transforming it into higher dimensions. It will then classify data into two classes, for example.  In the following example, the SVM will be used to separate risky driving locations from safer driving locations:  The example in the code is random  as in real-life traffic  but the model can be developed much further.  Safety is the key to this model, so each driving location  road, crossing  possesses features related to this goal:  Number of accidents at that location Traffic at that location Experience of driving through that location  near misses and no problems   All of this data can be fed into an SVM program. The program will transform the data to make it linearly separable  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:22 , Become an Unconventional Innovator .  The blue dots on the left will be the good locations, and the brown ones on the left will be the risky ones. To convert it back into GPS format, a function will just read the latitude and longitude features of the data point.  [ 308 ]   AI and the Internet of Things  IoT   Chapter 13  For example, a blue dot on the left might be:  Location A  One accident in the past 10 years Zero problems driving through that point in 1 year  A brown dot might be:  Location D  a few blocks from A  Seventy-four accidents in 10 years Fifteen problems driving through that point in 1 year  The blue dots and brown dots thus have nothing to do with the real location on the preceding graph. The locations are labels. Their features have been separated as expected.  To send the data to a GPS guiding system, all that needs to be done is to find the GPS coordinates of the locations that are part of the initial dataset.  Location A will be chosen, for example, instead of location D; so the program looks into the dataset and finds its GPS location.  Let's put some words on the following SVM graph:  The space between the dotted vertical lines is the margin. It's somewhat like the  margin between two lines of a rugby or football team. When the players  data points  are lined up, an invisible space or margin separates them.  [ 309 ]   AI and the Internet of Things  IoT   Chapter 13  The dots that touch those margins are critical because they are the ones that decide where the margin will be in the first place. As the rugby or football players line up in clusters, the SVM will calculate this  see the following Python function . These special data points are called support points. They can also be called support vectors. The vertical line running in the middle of the margin is the decision line. Since the dots are separated by a line, the dataset is linearly separable  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:22 , Become an Unconventional Innovator . This means that a line can be drawn between the data points and can separate them into classes. In this case, the system wants to obtain safe locations  blue dots  and avoid unsafe locations  brown dots .  Python function  The  cid:84  cid:76  cid:77  cid:70  cid:66  cid:83  cid:79  packages provide the following  cid:84  cid:87  cid:78  function:   cid:71  cid:83  cid:80  cid:78  cid:2  cid:84  cid:76  cid:77  cid:70  cid:66  cid:83  cid:79  cid:2  cid:74  cid:78  cid:81  cid:80  cid:83  cid:85  cid:2  cid:84  cid:87  cid:78   cid:71  cid:83  cid:80  cid:78  cid:2  cid:84  cid:76  cid:77  cid:70  cid:66  cid:83  cid:79  cid:16  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:84  cid:70  cid:85  cid:84  cid:2  cid:74  cid:78  cid:81  cid:80  cid:83  cid:85  cid:2  cid:78  cid:66  cid:76  cid:70  cid:64  cid:67  cid:77  cid:80  cid:67  cid:84   The  cid:78  cid:66  cid:76  cid:70  cid:64  cid:67  cid:77  cid:80  cid:67  cid:84  function generates uniform data for this example in all directions. It is thus an isotropic distribution  iso=equal, tropy=way  of random data. A blob contains points of data.   cid:84  cid:68  cid:74  cid:76  cid:74  cid:85  cid:15  cid:77  cid:70  cid:66  cid:83  cid:79  contains a Gaussian factor for the generation function. A Gaussian kernel applies standard deviations from a mean. Imagine you are playing in a sandbox and you make a little hill. Then, with your hand, you cut the pile in two. The mean is where you cut the sand pile; the standard deviation is shown by the slopes going down on both sides.  It might take days, and sometimes weeks, to put a good dataset together. But with  cid:84  cid:68  cid:74  cid:76  cid:74  cid:85  cid:15   cid:77  cid:70  cid:66  cid:83  cid:79 , you can do it in one line, as shown in the following code snippet:   cid:21  cid:20  cid:21  cid:28  cid:5  cid:19  cid:18  cid:18  cid:2  cid:68  cid:66  cid:83  cid:84  cid:2  cid:68  cid:77  cid:86  cid:84  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:84  cid:10  cid:68  cid:80  cid:79  cid:68  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:2  cid:80  cid:71  cid:2  cid:68  cid:66  cid:83  cid:84  cid:11  cid:2  cid:83  cid:70  cid:81  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:70  cid:69   cid:57  cid:14  cid:2  cid:90  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:78  cid:66  cid:76  cid:70  cid:64  cid:67  cid:77  cid:80  cid:67  cid:84  cid:10  cid:79  cid:64  cid:84  cid:66  cid:78  cid:81  cid:77  cid:70  cid:84  cid:31  cid:19  cid:18  cid:18  cid:14  cid:2  cid:68  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:84  cid:31  cid:20  cid:14  cid:2  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:80  cid:78  cid:64  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70  cid:31  cid:25  cid:11   This function offers many parameters. The ones used are as follows:   cid:79  cid:64  cid:84  cid:66  cid:78  cid:81  cid:77  cid:70  cid:84 , which represents the number of points spread out between the clusters. In this example, 100 already represents subclusters of car concentrations in an area.  [ 310 ]   AI and the Internet of Things  IoT   Chapter 13   cid:68  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:84  is the number of centers to generate data from. In this example,  cid:20  represents areas close to the present location of the self-driving car and its future destination.  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:80  cid:78  cid:64  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70  is the seed by the random number generator. It is where the sequence of random numbers will start. This is because what we think is random is pseudo-random, so it has some deterministic basis.  In this example, a  cid:77  cid:74  cid:79  cid:70  cid:66  cid:83  kernel is used to fit the model, as shown in the following code:   cid:21  cid:20  cid:23  cid:28  cid:5  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:78  cid:80  cid:69  cid:70  cid:77  cid:2  cid:74  cid:84  cid:2  cid:69  cid:74  cid:83  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:77  cid:90  cid:2  cid:71  cid:74  cid:85  cid:85  cid:70  cid:69  cid:16  cid:2  cid:53  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:72  cid:80  cid:66  cid:77  cid:2  cid:74  cid:84  cid:2  cid:66  cid:2  cid:72  cid:77  cid:80  cid:67  cid:66  cid:77  cid:2  cid:70  cid:84  cid:85  cid:74  cid:78  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70   cid:68  cid:77  cid:71  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:84  cid:87  cid:78  cid:16  cid:52  cid:55  cid:36  cid:10  cid:76  cid:70  cid:83  cid:79  cid:70  cid:77  cid:31  cid:9  cid:77  cid:74  cid:79  cid:70  cid:66  cid:83  cid:9  cid:14  cid:2  cid:36  cid:31  cid:19  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18  cid:11   cid:68  cid:77  cid:71  cid:16  cid:71  cid:74  cid:85  cid:10  cid:57  cid:14  cid:2  cid:90  cid:11   scikit-learn's SVM contains a parameter penalty, which explains the  cid:36  in  cid:84  cid:87  cid:78  cid:16  cid:52  cid:55  cid:36 . There are many more options, but the key option is the kernel. A linear kernel will produce a linear separation, as shown in the preceding screenshot.  An RBF kernel would produce a different result. The structure looks more regularized. As shown in the following screenshot, an RBF kernel acts as an efficient structural regularizer:  Bear in mind that the SVM can be used for image recognition on the MNIST and CIFAR datasets, for example. Artificial intelligence provides more than one way to solve a given problem. It is up to you to choose the right tools by having a flexible trial-and-error approach where necessary.  [ 311 ]   AI and the Internet of Things  IoT   Chapter 13  The plot lines start at line 300. The main line to take into account is the function that will find and use the decision line  see preceding definition  and scatter the data points on both sides of the margin. This is achieved by using the following  cid:69  cid:70  cid:68  cid:74  cid:84  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:64  cid:71  cid:86  cid:79  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79 :   cid:59  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:68  cid:77  cid:71  cid:16  cid:69  cid:70  cid:68  cid:74  cid:84  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:64  cid:71  cid:86  cid:79  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:10  cid:89  cid:90  cid:11  cid:16  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:70  cid:10  cid:57  cid:57  cid:16  cid:84  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:70  cid:11   The result will be displayed as shown previously. The SVM is now a component of the CRLMM in this self-driving car model.  Running the CRLMM The self-driving car's mission is a circular  no beginning, no end  one like the CRLMM described in the previous chapter:  If it is in a parking lot, it can be activated by a home or a shelter If it is at a given home, it will go to a shelter If at a shelter, it can go to a home or a parking space If it needs recharging, this can be done at a recharging space  or more probably at a parking space , which is already the case in some cities  At one point, the self-driving car has to go from a home to a parking space. This part of its itinerary is the subject of the following sections.  Finding a parking space  cid:36  cid:51  cid:45  cid:15  cid:46  cid:46  cid:15  cid:42  cid:80  cid:53  cid:64  cid:52  cid:55  cid:46  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  uses a fine-tuned version of the  cid:46  cid:37  cid:49  cid:64  cid:40  cid:83  cid:66  cid:81  cid:73  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  described in the previous chapter.  A no- cid:107   no gamma, no gap, no space  is not acceptable.  If the  cid:68  cid:83  cid:77  cid:78  cid:78  function, which classifies parking lot images into full or available space, returns a  cid:18 , the program detects it and displays a message.

It will thus try searches of good parking lots as shown in line  cid:21  cid:26  cid:26  of this code snippet:   cid:21  cid:26  cid:26  cid:28  cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:84  cid:70  cid:66  cid:83  cid:68  cid:73  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:72  cid:70  cid:10  cid:19  cid:18  cid:18  cid:18  cid:11  cid:28   cid:74  cid:71  cid:10  cid:68  cid:83  cid:77  cid:78  cid:78  cid:31  cid:31  cid:18  cid:11  cid:28   A thousand searches looks like a lot, but it isn't. Some cities already have parking spaces near sidewalks with recharging stations.  Furthermore, looking for available parking spaces in a large city can be excruciating. More often than not, it will not be suitable: there will be not enough available parking spaces to be sure to find one in the time it will take to get there.  [ 313 ]   AI and the Internet of Things  IoT   Chapter 13  For this prototype, the number of optimal searches is limited to  cid:20 . Beyond that value, the following  cid:36  cid:51  cid:45  cid:46  cid:46  function is activated:   cid:21  cid:27  cid:27  cid:28  cid:74  cid:71  cid:10  cid:84  cid:70  cid:66  cid:83  cid:68  cid:73  cid:32  cid:20  cid:11  cid:28   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:66  cid:31  cid:19   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:68  cid:83  cid:77  cid:78  cid:78  cid:31  cid:36  cid:51  cid:45  cid:46  cid:46  cid:10  cid:50  cid:14  cid:77  cid:83  cid:14  cid:70  cid:14  cid:66  cid:11   After two fruitless searches, the program activates  cid:66 , a flag for the  cid:68  cid:83  cid:77  cid:78  cid:78  function.  The  cid:68  cid:83  cid:77  cid:78  cid:78  function now contains a random search function, which simulates the choice of a parking lot and provides a first-level status:   cid:20  cid:18  cid:22  cid:28  cid:2  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:86  cid:84  cid:31  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:80  cid:78  cid:16  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:18  cid:14  cid:19  cid:18  cid:11   cid:2  cid:74  cid:71  cid:10  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:86  cid:84  cid:32  cid:23  cid:11  cid:28   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:86  cid:84  cid:31  cid:19   cid:2  cid:74  cid:71  cid:10  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:86  cid:84  cid:30  cid:31  cid:23  cid:11  cid:28   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:86  cid:84  cid:31  cid:18   The status represents a probabilistic estimate of the availability of the parking lot. The  cid:66  flag simulates a program yet to be added that will scan all the parking lots and run this function to find an available space.  To present a prototype on a first meeting, you will always need enough to convince, but if you go too far, the cost of doing this becomes a risk if your idea is rejected.

For Iotham, safety comes first.

Explained as follows, the weights of the statistics of past accidents and the car's experience can be added to create a deeper vision of this safety model trip planner.  Suppose the self-driving car has to go to a point in the brown area. The SVM will:  Suggest an itinerary that goes through blue dot areas as much as possible and then only in brown areas Send the information to Google Maps  Many drivers feel unsafe on loaded freeways or in dense cities. Adding the safest route function to mapping software would help.  The SVM brought the data points to a higher level  see the explanation in the configuration section of the chapter .  The points represented in an SVM function are not the actual locations but an abstract representation. The dividing line needs to go through a function that will transform that information into a real location data point.   [ 317 ]   AI and the Internet of Things  IoT   Chapter 13  Once the SVM boundaries have been converted into location data points, the itinerary or trip graph is activated.  The itinerary graph The prototype shows a simulation of an itinerary graph based on the SVM  recommendations and its weight vector through the following function call:   cid:22  cid:20  cid:19  cid:28  cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:4  cid:52  cid:34  cid:39  cid:38  cid:2  cid:49  cid:34  cid:52  cid:52  cid:34  cid:40  cid:38  cid:2  cid:52  cid:54  cid:40  cid:40  cid:38  cid:52  cid:53  cid:38  cid:37  cid:4  cid:11   cid:46  cid:37  cid:49  cid:64  cid:40  cid:51  cid:34  cid:49  cid:41  cid:10  cid:77  cid:83  cid:14  cid:70  cid:11   The following graph displays the safest itinerary in red even if it takes longer  time or distance :  For the purpose of the prototype, the SVM was not directly connected to the graph, which would require costly hours.

[ 318 ]   AI and the Internet of Things  IoT   Chapter 13  This type of prototype is more powerful than a slide show because it proves your legitimacy. Slideshows are static and don't prove your abilities on this particular subject. A prototype will show your expertise. But do not overdo it unless you have a budget!  The weight vector The weight vector is displayed. In this model, the weights represent the locations just like in the previous chapter. However, in this chapter, the weights are a rating:  Each weight has a high safety rank when few accidents have occurred around that area in the past n years. It is a safety rank. This ranking should be part of our itinerary software. We should be informed. Each weight will be customized by the self-driving car's experience. It is its own driving record. Near misses because of its faulty software will bring the weight down. Good track records will take the weights up. What seems easy for a human might be difficult for software and vice versa.  The system now displays the weights used with an internal update program to be developed if the prototype is accepted. The following code calls the function that manages the weights of the safest routes for the self-driving vehicle and displays a histogram:   cid:22  cid:20  cid:21  cid:28  cid:2  cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:4  cid:55  cid:70  cid:83  cid:85  cid:74  cid:68  cid:70  cid:2  cid:56  cid:70  cid:74  cid:72  cid:73  cid:85  cid:84  cid:4  cid:14  cid:56  cid:11   cid:46  cid:37  cid:49  cid:64  cid:36  cid:51  cid:45  cid:64  cid:72  cid:83  cid:66  cid:81  cid:73  cid:10  cid:56  cid:14  cid:77  cid:83  cid:11   [ 319 ]   AI and the Internet of Things  IoT   Chapter 13  Summary This chapter, like the previous chapter, described a connected IoT process with no humans involved. This trend will expand into every field in the years to come.  This also shows that knowing how to use a tool requires hard work, especially when learning artificial intelligence. Imagining a solution for a given market requires more than hard work. Creativity does not come with work. It develops by freeing your mind from any form of constraint.   Once the solution has been imagined, then comes the fine line between developing too much for a presentation and not showing enough. A CRLMM provides the kind of framework that helps build a technical solution  CNN, MDP, SVM, and optimizers  while keeping everyday concepts that others understand in mind.  For the first meeting with Iotham or any other city council members, a good slide show with a working prototype, along with some past references, would be a good start. A realistic approach would be to ask how far the prototype should be developed to have a chance to be on the shortlist.  The next chapter will lead us deeper into the corporate world by applying artificial intelligence to blockchains.  Questions  1. 2. 3.  4. 5.  6. 7.

For 1,000+ years, transactions have been mostly local bookkeeping systems. For the past 100 years, even though the computer age changed the way information was managed, things did not change that much. Each company continued to keep its transactions to itself, only sharing some information through tedious systems.  Blockchain makes a transaction block visible to the global network it has been generated in.   The fundamental concepts to keep in mind are sharing and privacy control. The two ideas seem to create a cognitive dissonance, something impossible to solve. Yet it has been solved, and it will change the world.  When a block  a transaction of any kind  is generated, it is shared with the whole network. Permissions to read the information within that block remain manageable and thus private if the regulator of that block wants the information to stay private.  Whether the goal is to mine bitcoins through blocks or use blocks for transactions, artificial intelligence will enhance this innovation shortly.  [ 323 ]   Optimizing Blockchains with AI  Chapter 14  Mining bitcoins Mining a bitcoin means creating a mathematical block for a valid transaction and adding this block to the chain, the blockchain:  Blockchain = {block1,block2,the block just added...blockn}  The blockchain cannot go back in time. It is like a time-dating feature in life. On minute m, you do something, on minute m+1 something else, on minute m+n something else, and so on. You cannot travel back in time. What is done is done.  When a block is added to the bitcoin chain, there is no way of undoing the transaction.   The global network of bitcoin mining consists of nodes. With the appropriate software, you leave a port open, allocate around 150+ GB of disk space, and generate new blocks. The nodes communicate with each other, and the information is relayed to the other nodes around the whole network.  For a node to be a miner, it must solve complex mathematical puzzles that are part of the bitcoin program.  To solve the puzzle, the software must find a number that fits in a specific range when combined with the data in the block being generated. The number is passed through a hash function.  You can call the number a nonce and it's used only once. For example, an integer between 0 and 4,294,967,296 for a bitcoin must be generated.  The process is random. The software generates a number, passes it through the hash function, and sends it out to the network. The first miner who produces a number in the expected range informs the whole network that that particular block has been generated. The rest of the network stops working on that block and moves on to another one.  The reward for the miner is naturally paid out in bitcoins. It represents a lot of money, but it's hard to get, considering the competition in the network and the cost required  CPU, electricity, disk space, and time  to produce correct results.  Keep an eye on quantum computers  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:25 , Quantum Computers That Think  because their exponential power could dramatically change the mining market.  [ 324 ]   Optimizing Blockchains with AI  Chapter 14  Using cryptocurrency  Be very careful with cryptocurrency. The concept sounds fascinating, but the result remains currency. Currency can be volatile, and you can lose your life's savings in less than an hour if a crash occurs.  Golden rule: If you cannot resist investing in cryptocurrencies, do not invest more than you can afford to lose.  That being said, to use cryptocurrency, first set up a wallet to store your bitcoins, for example. The wallet can be online, through a provider, or even offline.  Once that is done, you will be able to purchase bitcoins as you wish in hard cash, or using credit cards, debit cards, and transfers.  Remember, you are buying these currencies like any other currency with all the potential, but also all the risks, involved.  Using blockchains IBM blockchain, based on Hyperledger Fabric, provides a way for companies around the world to share a blockchain transaction network without worrying about mining or using cryptocurrencies.  The system is based on the Linux Foundation project. Hyperledger is an open source collaborative project hosted by the Linux Foundation.  At this level, Hyperledger uses blockchains to guarantee secure transactions without trying to optimize the cryptocurrency aspect. The software generates blocks in a blockchain network shared by all the parties involved, but they do not have to purchase cryptocurrencies in the currency sense cid:100 only in the technological sense.   [ 325 ]   Optimizing Blockchains with AI  Chapter 14  The following graph, used in previous chapters to illustrate the Markov Decision Process, is applied to a blockchain.  Each vertex represents a company that takes part in an IBM Hyperledger network set up for those six companies, as described in the following table:  Company  Activity  A buys and sells clothing and also other products in this network. B buys and sells fabric and also other products in this network. C buys and sells buttons and also other products in this network. D buys and sells printed fabric and also other products in this network. E buys and sells accessories  belts, bracelets  and also other products in this network. F buys and sells packaging boxes and also other products in this network.  Provide goods to the network but keep the stock levels down Provide goods to the network but keep the stock levels down Provide goods to the network but keep the stock levels down Provide goods to the network but keep the stock levels down Provide goods to the network but keep the stock levels down Provide goods to the network but keep the stock levels down  Weight in a CRLMM  Stock levels  Stock levels  Stock levels  Stock levels  Stock levels  Stock levels  [ 326 ]   Optimizing Blockchains with AI  Chapter 14  With millions of commercial transactions per year with a huge amount of transportation  truck, train, boat, air , it is impossible to manage this network effectively in the 21st century without a solution like IBM Hyperledger.  With IBM Hyperledger, the companies have one online transaction ledger with smart contracts  online  and real-time tracking.  The transactions are secure; they can be private or public among the members of the network and they provide real-time optimization information for an artificial intelligence solution.  Using blockchains in the A-F network IBM Hyperledger provides artificial intelligence developers with a unique advantage over any other dataset cid:100 a 100% reliable dataset updated in real time.   cid:36  cid:83  cid:70  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:66  cid:2  cid:67  cid:77  cid:80  cid:68  cid:76  A block is formed with the method described for mining a bitcoin, except that this time currency is not a goal. The goal is a secure transaction with a smart contract when necessary. The following screenshot is a standard IBM interface that can be customized:  [ 327 ]   Optimizing Blockchains with AI  Chapter 14  You can see the individual and unique blocks that make up a blockchain. Each block in IBM Hyperledger has a unique number. In this example, it is 111 with a zoom on block 103.  A block in the preceding A to F example can be the purchase of a product X with a contract. The next block can be the transportation of that product to another location and any transaction within the A-F blockchain network.  The information attached to that block is in the Hyperledger repository: company name, address, phone number, transaction description, and any other type of data required by the network of companies. Each block can be viewed by all or some depending on the permission properties attached to it.   cid:38  cid:89  cid:81  cid:77  cid:80  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:67  cid:77  cid:80  cid:68  cid:76  cid:84  Exploring the blocks provides an artificial intelligence program with a gold mine: a limitless, real-life, and 100% reliable dataset.  The interesting part for AI optimization is the block information, as described in the following screenshot. The present block was added to the chain along with the previous block and the transaction code.  [ 328 ]   Optimizing Blockchains with AI  Chapter 14  Notice that the block hash  see the preceding mining section  of a given block is linked to the previous block hash and possesses a unique transaction code.  The CRLMM will use some of the critical information as features to optimize warehouse storage and product availability in a real-time process.  To implement the CRLMM, an additional component is required: a naive Bayes learning function. The naive Bayes learning function will learn the previous block to predict and output the next blocks that should be inserted in the blockchain.  Using naive Bayes in a blockchain process Naive Bayes is based on Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem applies conditional probability, defined as follows:  P AB  is a posterior probability, the probability of A after having observed  some events  B . It is also a conditional probability: the likelihood of A happening given B has already happened. P BA  the probability of B given the prior observations A. It is also a conditional probability: the likelihood of B happening given A has already happened. P A  is the probability of A prior to the observations. P B  is the probability of the predictions.  Naive Bayes, although based on Bayes' theorem, assumes that the features in a class are independent of each other. In many cases, this makes predictions more practical to implement. The statistical presence of features, related or not, will produce a prediction. As long as the prediction remains sufficiently efficient, naive Bayes provides a good solution.  A naive Bayes example  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:20 , Automated Planning and Scheduling, described an apparel-manufacturing process. The CRLMM program used there optimized the load of the sewing stations.  [ 329 ]   Optimizing Blockchains with AI  Chapter 14  The load of a sewing station in an apparel industry is expressed in quantities, in stock keep units  SKUs . An SKU, for example, can be product P: a pair of jeans of a given size.  Once the garment has been produced, it goes into storage. At that point, a block in a blockchain can represent that transaction with two useful features for a machine learning algorithm:  The day the garment was stored The total quantity of that SKU-garment now in storage  Since the blockchain contains the storage blocks of all A, B, C, D, E, and F locations that are part of the network, a machine learning program can access the data and make predictions.  The goal is to spread the stored quantities of the given product evenly over the six locations, as represented in the following histogram:  [ 330 ]   Optimizing Blockchains with AI  Chapter 14  This screenshot shows the storage level of product P distributed over six locations. Each location in this blockchain network is a hub. A hub in supply chain management  SCM  is often an intermediate storage warehouse. For example, to cover the area of these six locations, the same product will be stored at each location. This way, local trucks can come and pick the goods for delivery.   The goal is to have an available product P at point A when needed. The delivery time from A to a location point a1  a store or home  will only take a few hours. If A did not store P, then the finer consumer would have to wait for the product to travel from C to A, for example.  If the blockchain network is well organized, one location can specialize in producing product P  best production costs  and evenly distribute the quantity stored in the six locations, including itself.  This load optimization approach is the same as the CRLMM  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:20 , Automated Planning and Scheduling. Reusing a model in domain learning will generate profit and lower costs. The more an AI solution can be applied to transfer, domain, and conceptual learning, the more powerful it will become. It will learn more and solve an endless number of problems.  The blockchain anticipation novelty In former days, all the warehouses at those six locations  A to F  had to ensure the minimum storage level for each location.   In a world of real-time producing and selling, distributors need to predict demand. The system needs to be demand driven. Naive Bayes can solve that problem.  It will take the first two features into account:  DAY: The day the garment was stored STOCK: The total quantity of that SKU-garment now in storage  Then it will add a novelty cid:100 the number of blocks related to product P.  A high number of blocks at a given date means that this product was in demand in general  production, distribution . The more blocks there are, the more transactions there are. Also, if the storage levels  STOCK feature  are diminishing, this is an indicator; it means storage levels must be replenished. The DAY feature time-stamps the history of the product.  [ 331 ]   Optimizing Blockchains with AI  Chapter 14  The block feature is named BLOCK. Since the blockchain is shared by all, a machine learning program can access reliable global data in seconds. The dataset reliability provided by blockchains constitutes a motivation in itself to optimize blocks.  The goal This CRLMM is the same one as in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:19 , Conceptual Representation Learning. The difference is that instead of analyzing a conveyor belt to make a decision, the system will analyze the blocks of a blockchain.  The program will take the DAY, STOCK, and BLOCKS  number of  features for a given product P and produce a result. The result predicts whether this product P will be in demand or not. If the answer is yes or 1, the demand for this product requires anticipation.   cid:52  cid:85  cid:70  cid:81  cid:2  cid:19  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:84  cid:70  cid:85  The dataset contains raw data from prior events in a sequence, which makes it perfect for prediction algorithms. This constitutes a unique opportunity to see the data of all companies without having to build a database. The raw dataset will look like the following list:  This dataset contains the following:  Blocks of product P present in the blockchain on day x scanning the blockchain back by 30 days. No means no significant amounts of blocks has been found. Yes means a significant number of blocks have been found. If blocks have been found, this means that there is a demand for this product somewhere along the blockchain.  [ 332 ]   Optimizing Blockchains with AI  Chapter 14  Some_blocks means that blocks have been found, but they are too sparse to be taken into account without overfitting the prediction. However, yes will contribute to the prediction as well as no. No_blocks means there is no demand at all, sparse or not  Some_blocks , numerous  blocks  or not. This means trouble for this product P.  The goal is to avoid predicting demand on sparse  Some_blocks  or absent  No_blocks  products. This example is trying to predict a potential Yes for numerous blocks for this product P. Only if Yes is predicted can the system trigger the automatic demand process  see the Implementation section later in the chapter .   cid:52  cid:85  cid:70  cid:81  cid:2  cid:20  cid:2  cid:71  cid:83  cid:70  cid:82  cid:86  cid:70  cid:79  cid:68  cid:90  Looking at the following frequency table provides additional information:  The Yes and No statuses of each feature  Blocks, Some_blocks, or No_blocks  for a given product P for a given period  past 30 days  have been grouped by frequency.   The sum is on the bottom line for each no feature and yes feature. For example, Yes and No_Blocks add up to 2.  Some additional information will prove useful for the final calculation:  The total number of samples = 10 The total number of yes samples = 8 The total number of no samples = 2  [ 333 ]   Optimizing Blockchains with AI  Chapter 14   cid:52  cid:85  cid:70  cid:81  cid:2  cid:21  cid:2  cid:77  cid:74  cid:76  cid:70  cid:77  cid:74  cid:73  cid:80  cid:80  cid:69  Now that the frequency table has been calculated, the following likelihood table is  produced using that data:  The table contains the following statistics:  No = 2 = 20% = 0.2 Yes = 8 = 80%=0.8 Some blocks = 2 = 20%=0.2 No blocks = 3 = 30%=0.3 Blocks = 5 = 50%=0.5  Blocks represent an important proportion of the samples, which means that along with some blocks, the demand looks good.   cid:52  cid:85  cid:70  cid:81  cid:2  cid:22  cid:2  cid:79  cid:66  cid:74  cid:87  cid:70  cid:2  cid:35  cid:66  cid:90  cid:70  cid:84  cid:2  cid:70  cid:82  cid:86  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  The goal now is to represent each variable of the Bayes' theorem in a naive Bayes equation to obtain the probability of having demand for product P and trigger a purchase scenario for the blockchain network. Bayes' theorem can be expressed as follows:  P YesBlocks =P BlocksYes  * P Yes  P Blocks  P Yes =8 10 = 0.8 P Blocks =5 10 = 0.5 P BlocksYes =4 8 = 0.5 P YesBlocks = 0.5*0.8  0.5 = 0.8  [ 334 ]   Optimizing Blockchains with AI  Chapter 14  The demand looks acceptable. However, penalties must be added and other factors must be considered as well  transportation availability through other block exploration processes .  This example and method show the concept of the naive Bayes approach. However, scikit- learn has excellent scientific functions that make implementation easier.  Implementation This section shows how to use an advanced version of naive Bayes and where to insert this component in the CRLMM described in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:19 , Conceptual Representation Learning.  Gaussian naive Bayes In implementation mode, a dataset with raw data from the blockchain will be used without the feature interpretation function of naive Bayes in the following table:  DAY STOCK BLOCKS DEMAND 10 11 12 14 15 10 12 15 12  1455 1666 1254 1563 1674 1465 1646 1746 1435  78 67 57 45 89 89 76 87 78  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2  Each line represents a block:  DAY: The day of the month scanned  dd mm yyyy can be used beyond a prototype  STOCK: The total inputs in a given location  A, B, or... F  found in the blocks and totaled on that day BLOCKS: The number of blocks containing product P for location A, for example  [ 335 ]   Optimizing Blockchains with AI  Chapter 14  A high number of blocks in the BLOCK column and a low number of quantities in the STOCK column mean that the demand is high.   DEMAND = 1. The proof of demand is a transaction block that contains a purchase in the past. These transaction blocks provide vital information.  A low number of blocks in the BLOCK column and a high number of quantities in the STOCK column mean that the demand is low.  DEMAND = 2. Proof that no transaction was found.  However, in some cases, DEMAND = 1 when the stock is high and the blocks are low. That's why strict correlation is not so useful where naive Bayes just analyzes the statistics and learns how to predict, ignoring the actual conditional probabilities.

Summary The reliable sequence of blocks in a blockchain has opened the door to endless machine learning algorithms. Naive Bayes appears to be a practical way to start optimizing the blocks of a blockchain. It calculates correlations and makes predictions by learning the independent features of a dataset, whether the relationship is conditional or not.  [ 338 ]   Optimizing Blockchains with AI  Chapter 14  This freestyle prediction approach fits the open-minded spirit of blockchains that propagate by the millions today with limitless resources.  IBM Hyperledger takes blockchain's "Frontierland" development to another level with the Linux Foundation project. IBM also offers a cloud platform and services.   IBM, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google provide cloud platforms with an arsenal of disruptive machine learning algorithms. This provides a smooth approach to your market or department, along with the ability to set up a blockchain prototype online in a short time. With this approach, you can enter some real prototype data in the model, export the data, or use an API to read the block sequences. Then you will be able to apply machine learning algorithms to these reliable datasets.  The limit is our imaginations.

IBM proposes a well-thought process to design a chatbot. Good architecture remains the key to a chatbot's success.  To make a chatbot meet user demands, IBM Watson has many services libraries  speech to text, text to speech, and much more .  The whole process can be customized with one's programs. This makes IBM Cloud an excellent place to start creating chatbots. The TextBlob project offers another set of NLP modules that provide some interesting ways of improving a chatbot.  This chapter starts by setting up an IBM Watson chatbot following IBM's standard procedure and shows how to use IBM Watson to add one's cognitive chatbot functions. A cognitive service in Python will be described to solve a case study. The problem to address is that of a tourist on a bus that just broke down.

Check out the following video to see the code in action:   cid:73  cid:85  cid:85  cid:81  cid:84  cid:28  cid:17  cid:17  cid:72  cid:80  cid:80  cid:16  cid:72  cid:77  cid:17  cid:51  cid:25  cid:82  cid:41  cid:76  cid:24   IBM Watson IBM's Watson conversation service has many development tools for creating a chatbot with compatible standard services  translations, digitized voice, voice recognition, and so on . You can set up your own basic account in a few clicks.  To create a chatbot, you need three major objects: intents, entities, and a dialog flow. To complete the dialog flow, there are additional features: conditions, context, and expressions for example. Then services can be added such as digitalized voice, speech recognition, and more.  This section describes how to build an interview chatbot named HobChat, a diet bot that can interview users.  [ 342 ]   Cognitive NLP Chatbots  Chapter 15  Intents An intent represents the initial subject of the conversation that the chatbot is initiating. The user input needs to be classified just as images need to be in a CNN, for example.  Let's say HobChat needs two types of information from the user:  whatkindof and food  You'll notice a fundamental concept here. We are getting information from a person and not the other way around. In many chatbots, the user asks a question to obtain an answer. HobChat works the other way around. It's extracting information through interrogation techniques.  Chatbots have different points of view:  Providing information for a user: tourism, online shopping, and other services Obtaining information from a user: medical applications, dietitians, sports trainers, and marketing Providing and gathering information  In this case, Hobchat's intent is to learn about whatkindof food the user likes. HobChat is prepared for the user to either answer or ask a question. To do that, we set up a list of variations of whatkindof in the system in the following intents interface:  [ 343 ]   Cognitive NLP Chatbots  Chapter 15  The intent name whatkindof will be detected if a similar phrase comes up:  whatkindof={what kindof, what type of, what sort ...n}  The number of sentences depends on the final use of the application. One similar phrase could suffice in some cases; in others, hundreds are required.  In this example, we can see that if HobChat asks What kind of food do you like? and if a user answers What type of what?, then the chatbot will apply a function f to the utterance.  f utterance  will provide the intent. f What kind of what? , for example, would be parsed and classified in the whatkindof intent.  The same has to be done with food, for example, as shown in the following screenshot:  The food intent subset is now ready to use:  food = {water, dessert, beverage, meat, dish, food}  Now that some intents have been created, it's time to test these subsets.  Testing the subsets IBM Watson provides a dialog tool to test the chatbot throughout the creation process. The  dialog tool can be set up intuitively in a few steps, as described in the following dialog section.  [ 344 ]   Cognitive NLP Chatbots  Chapter 15  The test dialog will run an initial dialog in the following dialog testing interface:  We can see that HobChat was activated to start a conversation called food interrogation. HobChat classifies the chatbot subject in food  blue in the screenshot  and starts the interview by asking a sort of generic text blob question What kind of food do you like to eat?.  This interview technology will also be beneficial for medical applications such as doctors asking patients questions to classify types of pathologies.  The user answers, "What?"  "What?" is processed as f utterance=f what = whatkindof.   To pursue this conversation, the chatbot needs entities.  Entities Now, we need to clarify Hobchat's food intent. What exactly are we talking about? What kind of food? To clarify our intent, we need entities that will describe our types of food in the following interface:  [ 345 ]   Cognitive NLP Chatbots  Chapter 15  Our food type entity is foodtypes={salad, meat, french fries}. We also need as many synonyms for each member of the foodtype group :  salad={iceberg lettuce, green stuff, iceberg, lettuce}  meat = {T-Bone, hamburger, cheeseburger}  french fries={potatoes, chips, greasy potatoes, greasy}  Now we can clarify our dialog with the food type entity in the following interface:  We've gone through the first part. Hobchat has asked the user, a person who visibly does not like such questions, What kind of food do you like?  A surprise entity was added so that Hobchat can detect surprise  emotion  in the answer:  The user answers: Are you kidding me?  Real-life conversations involve emotional answers a chatbot must deal with.  [ 346 ]   Cognitive NLP Chatbots  Chapter 15  The chatbot offers a calm response: We're just asking if you like green stuff or greasy stuff, that's all to get this interview going. So what do you prefer, the green stuff or the greasy stuff?  To find out what's going to happen next, we have to set up the dialog flow.  Dialog flow IBM Watson has an interface to configure the dialog flows shown previously.   To teach your chatbot how to conduct an interview using IBM Watson, or any other solution, requires a lot of cognitive science work to represent the expertise of a given field. Cognitive science involves linguistics, anthropology, psychology, philosophy, analyzing intelligence, and more.  The next section shows how to use services to implement a cognitive approach to solving a problem encountered by a chatbot.  First, a basic dialog flow must be configured. We are ready to create dialog scenarios for Hobchat. An IBM Watson conversation provides an efficient, ready-to-use platform, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 347 ]   Cognitive NLP Chatbots  Chapter 15  As you can see, it's a complex type of flowchart. You set up the dialog using your intents and entities, with all the possible linguistic variations you can provide. Then you can create an unlimited number of nodes in a combinatory tree.  You can add conditions, expressions, context, and also script as much as you want.  Scripting and building up the model In the preceding dialog flow graph, you can enter scripts. For example, at then respond with nodes, you can write your script as shown in the following script-editing interface:  In the preceding context script, on the top left, you can see then respond with. That means you can script your subdialogs within the dialog flow. You can add a random function such as  cid:84  cid:70  cid:77  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:64  cid:81  cid:80  cid:77  cid:74  cid:68  cid:90  cid:28  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:80  cid:78  so that the system changes phrases every time.   Your intents and entities can also be enriched by importing data. I recommend using big data map and retrieving techniques to boost the power of the dialog. The dialog will come close to human dialogs.  [ 348 ]   Cognitive NLP Chatbots  Chapter 15  IBM Watson entity features offer a vast number of entity feature add-ons, as the following screenshot shows:  The  cid:33  cid:52  cid:90  cid:84  cid:15  cid:81  cid:70  cid:83  cid:84  cid:80  cid:79  extracts names, the  cid:33  cid:84  cid:90  cid:84  cid:15  cid:77  cid:80  cid:68  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  system extracts place names  country, state province, city, town, and so on ,  cid:33  cid:84  cid:90  cid:84  cid:15  cid:85  cid:74  cid:78  cid:70  extracts the time,  cid:33  cid:84  cid:90  cid:84  cid:15  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70  extracts the date, and  cid:33  cid:84  cid:90  cid:84  cid:15  cid:68  cid:86  cid:83  cid:83  cid:70  cid:79  cid:68  cid:90  extracts the currency and other features.  The quality of a chatbot will depend on:  Not adding too many features, but just those required in some cases Adding all the necessary features when necessary, no matter how much time it takes  [ 349 ]   Cognitive NLP Chatbots  Chapter 15  Adding services to a chatbot IBM's Watson Conversation Service allows you to add all the services you want to your dialog flow, as shown in the following list:  IBM Watson provides a robust framework and a cloud service to build a solid, reliable chatbot.  With IBM Watson services, your imagination will be your only limit.  You can also implement a service of your own, such as a cognitive service.  A cognitive chatbot service You now have a chatbot running on IBM Watson or another platform. The architecture of an efficient chatbot requires restricting the perimeter of the functions to a minimum and getting it to work as quickly as possible.  With a solid foundation, the chatbot can now expand its limitless potential in the areas required. Services such as these can be added to a personal assistant, for example.  [ 350 ]   Cognitive NLP Chatbots  Chapter 15  The case study A bus of English-speaking tourists is traveling through France. Somewhere in the countryside, on a small road, the bus breaks down. A tourist will use a personal assistant with inbuilt functions to communicate with a police chatbot.   Nobody speaks French. One of the tourists has a tablet and an internet connection. It also has a personal assistant on it. It could be Google Assistant, Siri, Bixby, Alexa, Cortana, or any other.  For our purpose, let's assume it's Google Assistant and say we built a backend with Google Translate, with the API described in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:26 , Revolutions Designed for Some Corporations and Disruptive Innovations for Small to Large Companies.  The tourist types or says as described in that chapter:  cid:53  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:68  cid:80  cid:66  cid:68  cid:73  cid:2  cid:67  cid:83  cid:80  cid:76  cid:70  cid:2  cid:69  cid:80  cid:88  cid:79 . Google Translate produces a sentence in French, confusing "coach" with a sports coach and not translating it as "bus." As explained before, Google will no doubt correct this error, but there are still thousands more to correct.  This is not a problem but a limitation that we, as a worldwide community of artificial intelligence, must expand by sharing ideas.  A cognitive dataset A cognitive NLP chatbot must provide cognition. Humans think in more than words. Mostly humans combine words and images.  Furthermore, for a human, a chat generates mental images, sounds, odors, feelings, sensations, and much more.  The scenario is expanded to images for this case study:  The tourist will chat with the police chatbot using the inbuilt functions of a personal assistant. The police bot will answer that it does not understand the statement. The tourist's personal assistant will trigger off a deeper conversation level. They will find a way to understand each other using images to solve the problem.  In this section,  cid:36  cid:51  cid:45  cid:15  cid:46  cid:46  cid:15  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:67  cid:80  cid:85  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  will be described in a chronological way, following the sequence of the dialog.  [ 351 ]   Cognitive NLP Chatbots  Chapter 15  The program starts with an explanation of the scenario and shows where this new cognitive function could be inserted in  cid:40  cid:80  cid:80  cid:72  cid:77  cid:70  cid:64  cid:53  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:84  cid:77  cid:66  cid:85  cid:70  cid:64  cid:36  cid:86  cid:84  cid:85  cid:80  cid:78  cid:74  cid:91  cid:70  cid:69  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90   see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:26 , Revolutions Designed for Some Corporations and Disruptive Innovations for Small to Large Companies .    cid:36  cid:80  cid:72  cid:79  cid:74  cid:85  cid:74  cid:87  cid:70  cid:2  cid:79  cid:66  cid:85  cid:86  cid:83  cid:66  cid:77  cid:2  cid:77  cid:66  cid:79  cid:72  cid:86  cid:66  cid:72  cid:70  cid:2  cid:81  cid:83  cid:80  cid:68  cid:70  cid:84  cid:84  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  Conceptual representation learning meta-model  CRLMM  means describing concepts in words plus images, beyond using mathematical numerical vectors.

The sentiment has been analyzed through the  cid:81  cid:80  cid:77  cid:66  cid:83  cid:74  cid:85  cid:90  function. Negative values mean negative feelings, positive feelings come out as positive values, and 0 is neutral. In this case study,  cid:18  will be OK.  The sentiment estimation for the policeman's sentence is -0.3, which is not good at all.   Our dialog flow  see the explanation in the first section of the chapter  does not wish to add confusions to the present confusion. Since the sentiment is negative, instead of adding more words that might or might not be correctly translated, an image is displayed. In this example, a frown is displayed, as implemented in the following code:   cid:74  cid:71  cid:10  cid:84  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:74  cid:78  cid:70  cid:79  cid:85  cid:30  cid:18  cid:11  cid:28   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:4  cid:42  cid:46  cid:34  cid:40  cid:38  cid:2  cid:37  cid:42  cid:52  cid:49  cid:45  cid:34  cid:58  cid:38  cid:37  cid:28  cid:2  cid:39  cid:51  cid:48  cid:56  cid:47  cid:2  cid:48  cid:51  cid:2  cid:48  cid:53  cid:41  cid:38  cid:51  cid:2  cid:49  cid:48  cid:45  cid:58  cid:52  cid:38  cid:46  cid:58  cid:4  cid:11   cid:74  cid:78  cid:72  cid:68  cid:31  cid:69  cid:74  cid:83  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:80  cid:83  cid:90  cid:13  cid:9  cid:68  cid:68  cid:73  cid:66  cid:85  cid:17  cid:79  cid:80  cid:85  cid:80  cid:76  cid:16  cid:75  cid:81  cid:72  cid:9   cid:74  cid:78  cid:72  cid:68  cid:68  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:77  cid:80  cid:66  cid:69  cid:64  cid:74  cid:78  cid:72  cid:10  cid:74  cid:78  cid:72  cid:68  cid:14  cid:2  cid:85  cid:66  cid:83  cid:72  cid:70  cid:85  cid:64  cid:84  cid:74  cid:91  cid:70  cid:31  cid:10  cid:24  cid:22  cid:14  cid:2  cid:24  cid:22  cid:11  cid:11   cid:81  cid:77  cid:85  cid:16  cid:74  cid:78  cid:84  cid:73  cid:80  cid:88  cid:10  cid:74  cid:78  cid:72  cid:68  cid:68  cid:11   cid:81  cid:77  cid:85  cid:16  cid:84  cid:73  cid:80  cid:88  cid:10  cid:67  cid:77  cid:80  cid:68  cid:76  cid:31  cid:39  cid:66  cid:77  cid:84  cid:70  cid:11   cid:85  cid:74  cid:78  cid:70  cid:16  cid:84  cid:77  cid:70  cid:70  cid:81  cid:10  cid:23  cid:11   cid:81  cid:77  cid:85  cid:16  cid:68  cid:77  cid:80  cid:84  cid:70  cid:10  cid:11   The frown will appear and disappear automatically on the tablet or smartphone.

The CRLMM is beginning to use words + images to form concepts to express itself.  Words are sometimes confusing, especially in foreign-language environments on global social networks or personal assistants. Images will help clarify the conversation.  You can add a whole library of emoticons that will be activated by a sentiment analysis function such as TextBlob.  Activating an image + word cognitive chat To resolve their misunderstanding the tourist and the police bot both have an inbuilt CRLMM function in their personal assistants and cloud chatbot platform.

The user will answer: no.  The conceptual  images + words  polysemy has been triggered by the mistake the system made. Another image is displayed as follows, with a question:  The tourist may or may not understand the policeman's question. The question may or may not be correctly translated. But providing a yes or no answer to an image simplifies the communication problem.  The user answers yes  or clicks on a yes icon . The tourist + personal assistant bot and the police bot are now beginning to understand each other.  [ 355 ]   Cognitive NLP Chatbots  Chapter 15  Solving the problem  The chatbot has escalated into image + word chat mode. Confusing words have been replaced by an image and a yes no clarified communication function. The system now thinks it understands. However, the bot has to make sure that it understands as shown in the following screenshot of the program's dialog:   cid:49  cid:48  cid:45  cid:42  cid:36  cid:38  cid:28  cid:42  cid:2  cid:86  cid:79  cid:69  cid:70  cid:83  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:79  cid:69  cid:16  cid:2  cid:58  cid:80  cid:86  cid:83  cid:2  cid:67  cid:86  cid:84  cid:2  cid:67  cid:83  cid:80  cid:76  cid:70  cid:2  cid:69  cid:80  cid:88  cid:79  cid:16   cid:35  cid:86  cid:84  cid:13  cid:2  cid:67  cid:83  cid:80  cid:68  cid:76  cid:2  cid:69  cid:80  cid:88  cid:79   cid:42  cid:84  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:74  cid:84  cid:2  cid:88  cid:73  cid:66  cid:85  cid:2  cid:90  cid:80  cid:86  cid:2  cid:78  cid:70  cid:66  cid:79  cid:1   cid:38  cid:79  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:90  cid:70  cid:84  cid:2  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:79  cid:80  cid:28   It displays the following image of the situation  concept + words :  The tourist will recognize the bus and a sort of problem sign even if the words remain unclear.

Implementation Implementing a cognitive chatbot using CRLMM, as for any chatbot, needs to follow some well-organized steps:  Identify the intents and entities Create the dialog scenarios Dialog controls cid:100 all that the user clicks and answers Make an emoticon images repository Make a conceptual images repository Train and test the model with all sorts of scenarios; especially look out for the ones that fail to improve the system  [ 357 ]   Cognitive NLP Chatbots  Chapter 15  Summary IBM Watson provides a complete set of tools on IBM Cloud to build a chatbot, add services to it, and customize it with your own cognitive programs.  A good chatbot fits the need. Thinking the architecture through before starting development avoids underfitting  not enough functionality  or overfitting  functions that will not be used  of the model.  Determining the right intent  what is expected of the chatbot , determining the entities to describe the intent  the subsets of phrases and words , and creating a proper dialog will take quite some time.   If necessary, adding services and specially customized machine learning functions will enhance the quality of the system. The use of CRLMM introduces concepts  images + words  into chatbots, bringing them closer to how humans communicate.   NLP parses and learns words. CRL adds a higher dimension to those words with images. These images clarify interpretation and mistranslation problems. To close the gap between machines and humans, AI must bring emotional intelligence into chatbot dialogs.  The next chapter explores emotional intelligence through a Boltzmann machine  recently used by Netflix  and principal component analysis applied to a CRLMM's image + word  concept  approach.

Conceptual representation learning meta-models  CRLMM  can convert mathematical outputs into somewhat human mind models. Classical machine learning and deep learning programs mostly produce mathematical outputs. In previous chapters, CRLMM models produced enhanced conceptual representations, closing the gap between machine and human thinking.  The goal is clearly to build a mind, not an output, through several machine learning techniques: an RBM, sentiment analysis, CRLMM, RNN, LSTM, Word2Vec, and PCA. For each step, an application is available on a Windows or Linux platform, along with a video.  RBMs were presented in a Netflix competition for prediction purposes, namely to predict user choices. The ultimate goal of this model is not to predict what a person will say or do but to make an approximate mental clone of a human mind cid:100 to build thinking and feeling machines.   Building a mind requires teamwork between several AI models. This chapter describes a profiler solution that will build a profile of a person named X. A mental projection will be shown, representing part of the profile to prepare for a deeper profile by unleashing the power of quantum computing  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:25 , Quantum Computers That Think .

following method represents a starting point to build a mind in a machine.  It is based on a cognitive NLP chatbot I successfully delivered many years ago. It was  designed for language teaching and would teach a student, but more importantly, it would learn who that student was by memorizing the chats and storing words, images, and sounds. The bot would know more about the student after each session and ask questions about past conversations.  A random memory sentence was produced among many, such as:   cid:48  cid:73  cid:14  cid:2  cid:42  cid:2  cid:83  cid:70  cid:78  cid:70  cid:78  cid:67  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:90  cid:80  cid:86  cid:16  cid:2  cid:58  cid:80  cid:86  cid:2  cid:77  cid:74  cid:76  cid:70  cid:16  cid:16  cid:16  cid:16  cid:16   Then the profile dataset of the person was used to add:   cid:48  cid:73  cid:14  cid:2  cid:42  cid:2  cid:83  cid:70  cid:78  cid:70  cid:78  cid:67  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:90  cid:80  cid:86  cid:16  cid:2  cid:58  cid:80  cid:86  cid:2  cid:77  cid:74  cid:76  cid:70  cid:2  cid:13  cid:2 football  The voice was digitized  and a bit bumpy because of intonation problems , but it scared one of the first users enough to make the student stand up and go look to see if there was somebody behind the computer playing a prank.  [ 362 ]   Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots  Chapter 16  I had to build everything from scratch, which was excruciating but incredibly exhilarating. This project was fun and very profitable for a while, but that was 25+ years ago! There was no internet and no need to replace people. So that was it. I got some media attention but had to move on.  I then used the CRLMM model I had been describing during the previous chapters to introduce deep human concepts in an advanced planning and scheduling system; this is not meant to be a real-time planning tool like the one described in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:20 , Automated Planning and Scheduling.   This proves that building a mind is possible and will now happen. Maybe you can take everything in this book and become the architect of a thinking machine, and sell it to a corporation for deep decision-making purposes or as an advanced cognitive NLP chatbot.  Outer space, way above the sky, is the limit and might lead you to build the technology for a smart rocket on its road to Mars. It's at the touch of your fingertips.  How to read this chapter The goal is to show how to build a mind using several artificial intelligence techniques. Each technique will be briefly explained and then applied. At this point in the book, you know that all the network models encountered in machine learning contain inputs, activation functions, and outputs going through layers  visible and hidden . The flow is trained with an optimizer  loss function  and weights  with biases . There are many combinations of these models.   Each section contains a Python program you can run, explore, and view through a video. The video shows how a mind thinks in a 3D projection of thoughts and concepts. Image embedding was used to represent concepts  conceptual representation learning . Then PCA was applied.  The target scenario is for us to use machine learning tools and bots to gather data on a person named X. In  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:25 , Quantum Computers That Think, we will explore the mind of X cid:100 the very beginning of its machine clone that can be used to make decisions, chat, or simply dream and have fun.  [ 363 ]   Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots  Chapter 16  The profiling scenario The goal is to learn who X is and build a mind for X through a CRLMM approach added to other techniques.  Building a machine mind requires using all the machine learning techniques we can put together. It would take several months to produce a thinking machine for decision-making or chatbot purposes.   This x step scenario will provide enough data to start building a mind:  An RBM that will not try to predict what a user will do but will profile person X based on their Netflix ratings in an advanced approach A sentiment analysis function to gather information through X's social networks  A CRLMM function to gather images and begin to fit them with the words as X would do Using an RNN to generate sentences X could say in a data augmentation approach  Applying word embedding  word2vec  to the text to gather information on how X perceives words, not their general statistical meaning Representing some of X's professional environment words with word2vec in TensorFlow projector with PCA, to obtain a personal mental representation of how X sees the world  not the statistical representation   The goal is not to classify X or predict what X would do, but to understand X by representing X's mind.  Restricted Boltzmann Machines RBMs are random and undirected graph models generally built with a visible and a hidden layer. They were used in a Netflix competition to predict future user behaviors. The goal here is not to predict what X will do but find out who X is and store the data in X's profile- structured mind-dataset.

The connections between visible and hidden units The RBM model used contains two layers:  A visible layer A hidden layer  Many types of RBMs exist, but generally, they contain these properties:  There is no connection between the visible units There is no connection between the hidden units  [ 365 ]   Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots  Chapter 16  The visible and hidden layers are connected by a weight matrix and a bias vector, as shown in the following diagram:  The network contains six visible and two hidden units, producing a weight matrix of 2 x 6 values. Note that there are no connections between the visible or hidden units.

Only the weights will be analyzed for the profiling functions. The weights and biases are now in place.  Energy-based models An RBM is an energy-based model  EBM . An EBM uses probabilistic distributions defined by an energy function.  For a given x, E x  or E v,h  is one way of expressing the energy function of an RBM in a simplified, conceptual line. It is:  This energy function drives the model and will be used to direct weight and bias optimization:  The v  visible  and h  hidden  units are connected by W  the weights  b is an offset of the units that acts as a bias  Then the energy will be measured with a probabilistic function p:  [ 367 ]   Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots  Chapter 16  Z is a partition function for making sure that the sum of the probabilities of each x input does not exceed 1:  The partition function is the sum of all the individual probabilities of each x:  With each p x  divided by Z  the sum of all the probabilities , we will reach 1. The whole system is based on the energy between the visible and hidden units until the loss is optimized, as shown in the following  cid:51  cid:35  cid:46  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  code:   cid:70  cid:83  cid:83  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:79  cid:81  cid:16  cid:84  cid:86  cid:78  cid:10  cid:10  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:2  cid:15  cid:2  cid:79  cid:70  cid:72  cid:64  cid:87  cid:74  cid:84  cid:74  cid:67  cid:77  cid:70  cid:64  cid:81  cid:83  cid:80  cid:67  cid:84  cid:11  cid:2  cid:12  cid:12  cid:2  cid:20  cid:11   cid:74  cid:71  cid:2  cid:84  cid:70  cid:77  cid:71  cid:16  cid:69  cid:70  cid:67  cid:86  cid:72  cid:64  cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:28   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:4  cid:38  cid:81  cid:80  cid:68  cid:73  cid:2  cid:7  cid:84  cid:28  cid:2  cid:70  cid:83  cid:83  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:74  cid:84  cid:2  cid:7  cid:84  cid:4  cid:2  cid:7  cid:2  cid:10  cid:70  cid:81  cid:80  cid:68  cid:73  cid:14  cid:2  cid:70  cid:83  cid:83  cid:80  cid:83  cid:11  cid:11   Gibbs random sampling An RBM increases in efficiency when random variable sampling is applied during the  training process. Gibbs sampling generates a Markov chain of samples that takes the nearby samples into account as well.  Random sampling makes the system more objective. Hidden units remain latent  this is a two-layer system , which confers its dream property.

Humans mostly think in words+images and feel with words+images. Sounds, sensations, and odors are critical as well. That parameter can also be explored.   Profiling with images Humans communicate widely through images, symbols, and pictures. They also have a large number of mental image datasets cid:100 images that have been transformed and linked to words.  The goal of the bot's conversation now is to confirm the profile of X and suggest a movie to X, just for fun. An image was stored by X, and the name of a movie comes up called Lost? with a dark picture. It is supposed to appeal to the emotions of somebody who yearns for happiness and love and is curious to see whether something will be found.  [ 372 ]   Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots  Chapter 16  The following picture illustrates the darkness of being lost, with a forest as a symbol and light through the trees  hope? :  Now the streaming website chatbot will detect that a viewer has been scrolling for over 5 minutes without making a choice, for example.

Then only suggest a movie, not based on its category, but on more intrinsic features.  The next phase will be to increase the size of the mind-dataset with an RNN.  RNN for data augmentation An RNN models sequences, in this case, words. It analyzes anything in a sequence, including images. To speed the mind-dataset process up, data augmentation can be applied here exactly as it is to images in other models. In this case, an RNN will be applied to words.   A first look at its graph data flow structure shows that an RNN is a neural network like the others previously explored. The following graphs were obtained by first running  cid:45  cid:52  cid:53  cid:46  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  and then  cid:53  cid:70  cid:79  cid:84  cid:80  cid:83  cid:67  cid:80  cid:66  cid:83  cid:69  cid:64  cid:83  cid:70  cid:66  cid:69  cid:70  cid:83  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90 :  [ 374 ]   Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots  Chapter 16  The  cid:90  inputs  test data  go to the loss function   cid:45  cid:80  cid:84  cid:84  cid:64  cid:85  cid:83  cid:66  cid:74  cid:79   . The  cid:89  inputs  training data  will be transformed through weights and biases into logits with a softmax function. A zoom into the RNN area of the graph shows the following  cid:67  cid:66  cid:84  cid:74  cid:68  cid:64  cid:77  cid:84  cid:85  cid:78  cid:2  cid:68  cid:70  cid:77  cid:77 :  What makes an RNN special is to be found in the LSTM cell.  RNNs and LSTMs An LSTM is an RNN that best shows how RNNs work.   An RNN contains functions that take the output of a layer and feed it back to the input in sequences simulating time. This feedback process takes information in a sequence. For example:  The->movie->was->interesting->but->I->didn't->like->It  An RNN will unroll a stack of words into a sequence and parse a window of words to the right and to the left. For example, in this sentence, an RNN can start with interesting  bold  and then read the words on the right and left  italics . These are some of the hyperparameters of the RNN.  This sequence aspect opens the door to sequence prediction. Instead of recognizing a whole pattern of data at the same time, it is recognizing the sequence of data, as in this example.  [ 375 ]   Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots  Chapter 16  A network with no RNN will recognize the following vector as a week, a pattern just like any other one:  An RNN will explore the same data in a sequence by unrolling streams of data.  Monday->Tuesday-Wednesday->Thursday->Friday->Saturday-Sunday  The main difference lies in the fact that once trained, the network will predict the following: if Wednesday is the input, Thursday could be one of the outputs. This is shown in the next section.  RNN, LSTM, and vanishing gradients To simulate sequences and memory, an RNN and an LSTM will use backpropagation algorithms.  An RNN often has problems of gradients when calculating them over deeper and deeper layers in the network. Sometimes, it vanishes  too close to 0  due to the sequence property, just like us when a memory sequence becomes too long.   The backpropagation  just like us in a sequence  becomes less efficient. The are many backpropagation algorithms such as vanilla backpropagation, which is commonly used. This algorithm performs efficient backpropagation because it updates the weights after every training pattern.   One way to force the gradient not to vanish is to use a ReLU activation function, f x =max 0,x , forcing values on the model so that it will not get stuck.  Another way is to use an LSTM cell containing a forget gate between the input and the output cells, a bit like us when we get stuck in a memory sequence and we say "whatever" and move on.  [ 376 ]   Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots  Chapter 16  To explore this type of network deeper,  cid:45  cid:52  cid:53  cid:46  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  runs on a MNIST example.  cid:53  cid:70  cid:79  cid:84  cid:80  cid:83  cid:67  cid:80  cid:66  cid:83  cid:69  cid:64  cid:83  cid:70  cid:66  cid:69  cid:70  cid:83  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  will display the data flow graph structure.  The LSTM cell will act as a memory gate with 0 and 1 values, for example. This cell will forget some information to have a fresh view of the information it has unrolled into a sequence.  The key idea of an RNN is that it unrolls information into sequences.

[ 378 ]   Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots  Chapter 16  Word embedding The mind-dataset of X has begun to pile up a lot of data. It's time to introduce a word to vector model to determine how X sees words.  Building a mind-dataset is not like a dictionary that provides a standard definition for everybody. In this project, we want to target person X's personality.  This approach is about profiling X to understand how X perceives a word. For example, a dictionary might depict the season spring as something flowery. But X does not like spring as we have seen. X prefers autumn and its mild sadness.  So in X's dictionary, the definition of autumn is closer to satisfying than summer. This type of bot takes personal views into account to build a personal profiled mind-dataset. On the contrary, a standard dictionary would not suggest a preference between two seasons.  Word2vec will be used for customized phrases.  The Word2vec model A vector space model  VSM  takes words and transforms them into a vector space. In this  continuous space, similar words are represented in points near each other. This vectorial mapping process is called embedding.  Word2vec takes raw text, finds the words nearest to each other, and maps them into vectors. The system will take words, build them into a dictionary, and then input indexes.  A skip-gram model is applied to the sequences with a skip window. In that skip window, a number of words are taken into consideration on the left and the right. Then the model skips, and it will reuse and input several times to produce a label as implemented in  cid:70  cid:78  cid:67  cid:70  cid:69  cid:69  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90 .

Principal component analysis General dictionary or encyclopedia representations of words, images, and concepts satisfy many needs. The probabilistic machine learning approach is applied very efficiently to marketing by Facebook, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, IBM, and many other corporations.  Probabilistic machine learning training remains efficient when targeting apparels, food, books, music, travel, cars, and other market consumer segments.  However, humans are not just consumers; they are human beings. When they contact websites or call centers, standard answers or stereotyped emotional tone analysis approaches can depend on one's nerves. When humans are in contact with doctors, lawyers, and other professional services, a touch of humanity is necessary if major personal crises occur.  The PCA phase is there to build a mental representation of X's profile either to communicate with X or use X's mind as a powerful, mind-full chatbot or decision maker.  The input data for this PCA is the output of  cid:38  cid:78  cid:67  cid:70  cid:69  cid:69  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  described in the previous section. TensorFlow stored the model, data and labels in its  cid:77  cid:80  cid:72  cid:17  directory.  TensorBoard projector has an inbuilt PCA loader.  [ 382 ]   Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots  Chapter 16  Intuitive explanation  PCA takes data and represents it at a higher level.   For example, imagine you are in your bedroom. You have some books, magazines, and music  maybe on your smartphone  around the room. If you consider your room as a 3D Cartesian coordinate system, the objects in your room are all in specific x, y, z coordinates.   For experimentation purposes, take your favorite objects and put them on your bed. Put the objects you like the most near each other and your second choices a bit further away. If you imagine your bed as a 2D Cartesian space, you have just made your objects change dimensions.   They are not in their usual place anymore; they are on your bed and at specific coordinates depending on your tastes.  That is the philosophy of PCA. If the number of data points in the dataset is very large, the PCA of a mental dataset of one person will always be different from the PCA representation of another person like DNA.  That is what CRLMM is about as applied to a person's mental representation. Each person is different, and each person deserves a customized chatbot or bot treatment.  Mathematical explanation The mains steps for calculating PCA are important for understanding how to go from the intuitive approach to how TensorBoard projector represents datasets using PCA.  Variance Step 1: Calculate the mean of the array  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:19 .  You can check this with the  cid:78  cid:66  cid:85  cid:73  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90 , as shown in the following function:   cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:19  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:60  cid:19  cid:14  cid:2  cid:20  cid:14  cid:2  cid:21  cid:14  cid:2  cid:22  cid:62   cid:46  cid:19  cid:31  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:84  cid:85  cid:74  cid:68  cid:84  cid:16  cid:78  cid:70  cid:66  cid:79  cid:10  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:19  cid:11   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:4  cid:46  cid:70  cid:66  cid:79  cid:2  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:19  cid:4  cid:14  cid:46  cid:19  cid:11   [ 383 ]   Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots  Chapter 16  The answer is  cid:20  cid:16  cid:23 .

The mean calculation is done with the following standard function:   cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:20  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:60  cid:19  cid:14  cid:2  cid:20  cid:14  cid:2  cid:21  cid:14  cid:2  cid:23  cid:62   cid:46  cid:20  cid:31  cid:84  cid:85  cid:66  cid:85  cid:74  cid:84  cid:85  cid:74  cid:68  cid:84  cid:16  cid:78  cid:70  cid:66  cid:79  cid:10  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:20  cid:11   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:4  cid:46  cid:70  cid:66  cid:79  cid:2  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:20  cid:4  cid:14  cid:46  cid:20  cid:11   The answer is:  The bar above the X signifies that it is a mean.  Step 3: Calculate the variance using the following equation:  Now NumPy will calculate the variance with the absolute value of each  cid:89  minus the mean, sum them up, and divide the sum by n as shown in the following snippet.   cid:5  cid:87  cid:66  cid:83  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:78  cid:70  cid:66  cid:79  cid:10  cid:66  cid:67  cid:84  cid:10  cid:89  cid:2  cid:15  cid:2  cid:89  cid:16  cid:78  cid:70  cid:66  cid:79  cid:10  cid:11  cid:11  cid:12  cid:12  cid:20  cid:11  cid:16   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:4  cid:55  cid:66  cid:83  cid:74  cid:66  cid:79  cid:68  cid:70  cid:2  cid:19  cid:4  cid:14  cid:2  cid:79  cid:81  cid:16  cid:87  cid:66  cid:83  cid:10  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:19  cid:11  cid:11   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:4  cid:55  cid:66  cid:83  cid:74  cid:66  cid:79  cid:68  cid:70  cid:2  cid:20  cid:4  cid:14  cid:2  cid:79  cid:81  cid:16  cid:87  cid:66  cid:83  cid:10  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:20  cid:11  cid:11   Some variances are calculated with n-1 depending on the population of the dataset.  The result of the program for variances is as displayed in the following output:   cid:46  cid:70  cid:66  cid:79  cid:2  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:19  cid:2  cid:20  cid:16  cid:23   cid:46  cid:70  cid:66  cid:79  cid:2  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:20  cid:2  cid:20  cid:16  cid:25  cid:23   cid:55  cid:66  cid:83  cid:74  cid:66  cid:79  cid:68  cid:70  cid:2  cid:19  cid:2  cid:19  cid:16  cid:20  cid:23   cid:55  cid:66  cid:83  cid:74  cid:66  cid:79  cid:68  cid:70  cid:2  cid:20  cid:2  cid:20  cid:16  cid:19  cid:26  cid:25  cid:23   We can already see that  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:20  varies a lot more than  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:19 . Do they fit together? Are their variances close or not? Do they vary in the same way?   [ 384 ]   Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots  Chapter 16  Covariance Our goal in this section is to find out whether two words, for example, will often be found together or close to each other, taking the output of the embedding program into account.  Covariance will tell us whether these datasets vary together or not. The equation follows the same philosophy as variance, but now both variances are joined to see whether they belong together or not:  As with the variance, the denominator can be n-1 depending on your model. Also, in this equation, the numerator is expanded to visualize the co-part of covariance, as implemented in the following array in  cid:78  cid:66  cid:85  cid:73  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90 :   cid:89  cid:31  cid:79  cid:81  cid:16  cid:66  cid:83  cid:83  cid:66  cid:90  cid:10  cid:60  cid:60  cid:19  cid:14  cid:2  cid:20  cid:14  cid:2  cid:21  cid:14  cid:2  cid:22  cid:62  cid:14   cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:2  cid:60  cid:19  cid:14  cid:2  cid:20  cid:14  cid:2  cid:21  cid:14  cid:2  cid:23  cid:62  cid:62  cid:11   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:79  cid:81  cid:16  cid:68  cid:80  cid:87  cid:10  cid:89  cid:11  cid:11   NumPy's output is a covariance matrix a:  If you increase some of the values of the dataset, it will increase the value of the parts of the matrix. If you decrease some of the values of the dataset, the elements of the covariance matrix will decrease.  Looking at some of the elements of the matrix increase or decrease that way takes time and observation. What if we could find one value or two values that would give us that information?  Eigenvalues and eigenvectors To make sense out of the covariance of the covariance matrix, the eigenvector will point to the direction in which the covariances are going. The eigenvalues will express the magnitude or importance of a given feature.  [ 385 ]   Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots  Chapter 16  To sum it up, an eigenvector will provide the direction and the eigenvalue the importance for the covariance matrix a. With those results, we will be able to represent the PCA with TensorBoard projector in a multi-dimensional space.  Let w be an eigenvalue s  of a. An eigenvalue s  must satisfy the following equation:  There must exist a vector v for which dot a,v  is the same as w*v:  NumPy will do the math through the following function:   cid:71  cid:83  cid:80  cid:78  cid:2  cid:79  cid:86  cid:78  cid:81  cid:90  cid:2  cid:74  cid:78  cid:81  cid:80  cid:83  cid:85  cid:2  cid:77  cid:74  cid:79  cid:66  cid:77  cid:72  cid:2  cid:66  cid:84  cid:2  cid:45  cid:34   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:2  cid:10  cid:4  cid:70  cid:74  cid:72  cid:70  cid:79  cid:87  cid:66  cid:77  cid:86  cid:70  cid:84  cid:4  cid:14  cid:2  cid:79  cid:81  cid:16  cid:77  cid:74  cid:79  cid:66  cid:77  cid:72  cid:16  cid:70  cid:74  cid:72  cid:87  cid:66  cid:77  cid:84  cid:10  cid:66  cid:11  cid:11   The eigenvalues are  in ascending order  displayed in the following output:   cid:38  cid:74  cid:72  cid:70  cid:79  cid:87  cid:66  cid:77  cid:86  cid:70  cid:84  cid:2  cid:60  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:21  cid:24  cid:24  cid:23  cid:24  cid:26  cid:19  cid:2  cid:2  cid:22  cid:16  cid:23  cid:22  cid:24  cid:24  cid:25  cid:24  cid:23  cid:20  cid:62   Now we need the eigenvectors to see in which direction these values should be applied. NumPy provides a function to calculate both the eigenvalues and eigenvectors together. That is because eigenvectors are calculated using the eigenvalues of a matrix as shown in this code snippet:   cid:71  cid:83  cid:80  cid:78  cid:2  cid:79  cid:86  cid:78  cid:81  cid:90  cid:2  cid:74  cid:78  cid:81  cid:80  cid:83  cid:85  cid:2  cid:77  cid:74  cid:79  cid:66  cid:77  cid:72  cid:2  cid:66  cid:84  cid:2  cid:45  cid:34   cid:88  cid:14  cid:2  cid:87  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:45  cid:34  cid:16  cid:70  cid:74  cid:72  cid:73  cid:10  cid:66  cid:11   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:4  cid:70  cid:74  cid:72  cid:70  cid:79  cid:87  cid:66  cid:77  cid:86  cid:70  cid:10  cid:84  cid:11  cid:4  cid:14  cid:88  cid:11   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:4  cid:70  cid:74  cid:72  cid:70  cid:79  cid:87  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:80  cid:83  cid:10  cid:84  cid:11  cid:4  cid:14  cid:87  cid:11   The output of the program is:   cid:70  cid:74  cid:72  cid:70  cid:79  cid:87  cid:66  cid:77  cid:86  cid:70  cid:10  cid:84  cid:11  cid:2  cid:60  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:18  cid:21  cid:24  cid:24  cid:23  cid:24  cid:26  cid:19  cid:2  cid:22  cid:16  cid:23  cid:22  cid:24  cid:24  cid:25  cid:24  cid:23  cid:20  cid:62   cid:70  cid:74  cid:72  cid:70  cid:79  cid:87  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:80  cid:83  cid:10  cid:84  cid:11  cid:2  cid:60  cid:60  cid:15  cid:18  cid:16  cid:25  cid:27  cid:27  cid:19  cid:19  cid:20  cid:20  cid:19  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:24  cid:18  cid:19  cid:19  cid:26  cid:19  cid:27  cid:2  cid:62   cid:60  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:24  cid:18  cid:19  cid:19  cid:26  cid:19  cid:27  cid:2  cid:18  cid:16  cid:25  cid:27  cid:27  cid:19  cid:19  cid:20  cid:20  cid:19  cid:62  cid:62   Eigenvalues come in a 1D array with the eigenvalues of  cid:66 .  Eigenvectors come in a 2D square array with the corresponding  to each eigenvalue  in columns.   [ 386 ]   Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots  Chapter 16  Creating the feature vector The remaining step is to sort the eigenvalues from the highest to the lowest value. The highest eigenvalue will provide the principal component  most important . The eigenvector that goes with it will be its feature vector. You can choose to ignore the lowest values or features. In the dataset, there will be hundreds and often thousands of features to represent. Now we have the feature vector:  Feature Vector=FV={eigenvector1,eigenvector2...n}  n means that there could be many more features to transform into a PCA feature vector.  Deriving the dataset The last step is to transpose the feature vector and original dataset and multiply the row feature vector by row data:  Data that will be displayed=row of feature vector * row of data  Summing it up The highest value of eigenvalues is the principal component. The eigenvector will determine in which direction the data points will be oriented when multiplied by that vector.   TensorBoard Projector TensorBoard projector loads the metadata from the output of the  cid:38  cid:78  cid:67  cid:70  cid:69  cid:69  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  located in the  cid:77  cid:80  cid:72  directory. First, run  cid:38  cid:78  cid:67  cid:70  cid:69  cid:69  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90 . Then run  cid:53  cid:70  cid:79  cid:84  cid:80  cid:83  cid:67  cid:80  cid:66  cid:83  cid:69  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90 . For this example, click on Load data and load the  cid:77  cid:66  cid:67  cid:70  cid:77  cid:84  cid:16  cid:85  cid:84  cid:87  file from the  cid:77  cid:80  cid:72  directory generated by  cid:38  cid:78  cid:67  cid:70  cid:69  cid:69  cid:74  cid:79  cid:72  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90 .  [ 387 ]   Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots  Chapter 16  Next, TensorBoard runs a PCA calculation  the option on the left in the TensorBoard window  as explained previously. It then displays a 3D view, as shown in the following screenshot:  You can now select words on the right-hand side of the window, move the projection around in 3D, zoom, and explore the workplace mind of X.  Using Jacobian matrices Using a matrix of partial derivatives is also possible. It shows the local trend of the data being explored. A Jacobian matrix contains partial derivatives.  A Jacobian matrix that contains the partial derivatives of X's mind functions produced between two periods of time can prove useful when minute trends need to be analyzed. The philosophy remains the same as for measuring covariances. The goal is to see the trends in the variables of X's mind.  [ 388 ]   Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots  Chapter 16  Summary Efficient machine learning programs produce good results but do not build a mind. To produce complex AI solutions, no single technique  MDP, CNN, RNN, or any other  will suffice. An efficient artificial intelligence solution to a complex problem will necessarily be an innovative combination of various techniques. This chapter showed how to start building one using an RBM, a tone analyzer  sentiment analysis , a CRLMM, an RNN, a word2vec program, and PCA.  X's mind-dataset has been enriched with the beginning of an actual memory with word and feeling associations as image and word associations. This brings X's mind-dataset profile beyond dictionary definitions, predictive statistics, and linear dimensional personality definitions.  Artificial intelligence will go beyond the present trend of mathematical probabilistic approaches into the realms of our minds.  Great progress has been made by major corporations distributing machine learning cloud platforms  Google, Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, and many more . CRLMM will become a necessity to solve complex problems that mathematical probabilities cannot, such as empathetic chatbots or deep thinking machines.  Much more work needs to be done during each phase described in this chapter to obtain a powerful mind that resembles X's. Quantum computing possesses the tremendous power and complexity to bring a thinking machine to another level.  Questions  1. 2. 3. 4. 5.  RBMs are based on directed graphs.

In a few years, quantum computing will become disruptive and will provide exponential computer power.  This unique computer capacity in the history of humanity opens the doors to obtaining results that would be impossible to reach with classical computers. Quantum computers in themselves will not provide revolutionary algorithms. But quantum computer power will take present-day algorithms beyond the limits of our imagination.  This chapter explains why quantum computers are superior to classical computers, what a quantum bit is, how to use it, and how the Quantum Mind experiment can lead to a quantum thinking machine. Quantum Mind is based on CRLMM, which I have been successfully applying to many corporate sites. Quantum Mind is named MindX.  The following topics will be covered in this chapter:  Explaining why quantum computers are more powerful than other classical computers Defining what a quantum bit is Bloch sphere Quantum computing PCA representation of a CRLMM How to build a MindX, a thinking quantum computer   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  How to read this chapter  Dive into X's mind through this video of this chapter, link in the next section. A mind contains emotions, doubts, happiness, sadness, positive thoughts, negative feelings, and more. Use the explanations on quantum computing to imagine how powerful a personal mental representation could become with CRLMM.

Quantum computer speed A standard computer bit has a 0 or a 1 state. A classical computer will manage 0 or 1, as the system chooses, but it remains limited to choosing 1 or  XOR  0. It cannot manage both states at the same time.  A quantum computer is not constrained by an XOR state. It is an AND state. It can manage 0 and 1 at the same time until it is measured. A quantum state is unknown until observed, so a quantum program can use 0 and 1 at the same time. Once observed, the qubit will take a value of 0 or 1 because of the physical instability of a quantum state.  Just observing a quantum state makes the state break down. In quantum computing, this is called decoherence. It is not magic as some sci-fi hype suggests. Qubits are unstable. When observed, the quantum state breaks down.  This means quantum computing is memoryless once it is measured. Storage does not exist in a quantum computer. The input is made by a classical computer and the output goes back to a classical computer to be stored through the following process:  A Classical computer provides an input A Quantum Computer processes the input and produces an output A Classical computer interprets  the output  [ 393 ]   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  That being said, the computing power of a quantum computer fully justifies this architectural constraint.  Until a qubit is observed, it can have a 0 or 1 state or a probability in between, such as 0.1, 0.7, or 0.9.  Observing the situation is called measuring the state. When measured, only 0 or  XOR  1 will become the result.   Until the state is measured, a large number of probabilities are possible. If a qubit is added to the system, we now have two qubits and four elementary combinations all at the same time.  Unlike standard computer logic, all four of the states can be used to compute algorithms at the same time in a parallel process. The volume of possible states of a given algorithm will thus expand with the number of qubits involved. An estimation of the volume of states can be made with the following number, in which q is the number of qubits:  2q  Looking at the tiny equation does not seem awesome at all. Now, let's see what it looks like in a loop that runs up to 100 qubits:   cid:74  cid:78  cid:81  cid:80  cid:83  cid:85  cid:2  cid:79  cid:86  cid:78  cid:81  cid:90  cid:2  cid:66  cid:84  cid:2  cid:79  cid:81   cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:82  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:83  cid:66  cid:79  cid:72  cid:70  cid:10  cid:19  cid:18  cid:19  cid:11  cid:28   cid:2  cid:87  cid:31  cid:10  cid:20  cid:12  cid:12  cid:82  cid:11   cid:2  cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:4  cid:52  cid:74  cid:91  cid:70  cid:2  cid:80  cid:71  cid:2  cid:79  cid:67  cid:2  cid:85  cid:80  cid:2  cid:69  cid:70  cid:84  cid:68  cid:83  cid:74  cid:67  cid:70  cid:4  cid:14  cid:82  cid:14  cid:4  cid:2  cid:82  cid:86  cid:67  cid:74  cid:85  cid:84  cid:28  cid:4  cid:14  cid:4  cid:92  cid:28  cid:14  cid:94  cid:4  cid:16  cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:78  cid:66  cid:85  cid:10  cid:87  cid:11  cid:11   The program does not appear fearsome either.

often calculated in petabytes. A petabyte=1015 or about 250 bytes.  Facebook stores data for 2 billion-plus accounts. Imagine Facebook reaches 500 petabytes in the near future. Let's see what  cid:23  cid:18  cid:18  petabytes approximately add up to in the following code:   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:4  cid:39  cid:66  cid:68  cid:70  cid:67  cid:80  cid:80  cid:76  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:79  cid:70  cid:66  cid:83  cid:2  cid:71  cid:86  cid:85  cid:86  cid:83  cid:70  cid:28  cid:4  cid:11   cid:84  cid:31  cid:10  cid:20  cid:12  cid:12  cid:23  cid:18  cid:11  cid:12  cid:23  cid:18  cid:18   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:10  cid:4  cid:92  cid:28  cid:14  cid:94  cid:4  cid:16  cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:78  cid:66  cid:85  cid:10  cid:87  cid:11  cid:11   The output is quite surprising because it is about the size of data of a 100-qubit quantum computer can compute in one run:   cid:39  cid:66  cid:68  cid:70  cid:67  cid:80  cid:80  cid:76  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:79  cid:70  cid:66  cid:83  cid:2  cid:71  cid:86  cid:85  cid:86  cid:83  cid:70  cid:28   cid:19  cid:14  cid:20  cid:24  cid:25  cid:14  cid:24  cid:23  cid:18  cid:14  cid:24  cid:18  cid:18  cid:14  cid:20  cid:20  cid:26  cid:14  cid:20  cid:20  cid:27  cid:14  cid:22  cid:18  cid:19  cid:14  cid:22  cid:27  cid:24  cid:14  cid:25  cid:18  cid:21  cid:14  cid:20  cid:18  cid:23  cid:14  cid:21  cid:25  cid:24   This means that a single quantum computer with 100 qubits can run a calculation of the size of all data that 2,000,000,000+ Facebook accounts might represent in the near future.  The quantum computer will not actually contain that volume of data at all, but it shows that it can produce a calculation with that volume of computation information.  More importantly, this also means that a single quantum computer can run a mind-dataset of a single mind  see the next section  and calculate associations. This thinking process can generate an exponential volume of connections.  A classical n-bit computer manages n-bits whereas a quantum computer will manage 2n bits or 2q bits.  Compared to quantum computers 2q exponential power, soon classical computers will seem like relics of the past for scientific calculations. Classical computers will still be in use. But quantum computers will be the tools to explore the world beyond the present limits of artificial intelligence.   Visualize all the AI solutions you saw in this book. They will already seem to have some dust of the past on them once you get your hands on quantum computing.  Quantum computers will beat any other computer in many fields in the years to come. In one parallel computation, a quantum will do in one run what would take years for classical computers to calculate.  [ 395 ]   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  Now think about what a network of many quantum computers can do!  Often, we try to compare large volumes with the number of stars in the universe. And we say, That's more than the number of stars in our universe. We must now look in the opposite direction.  The lesson is clear: The future lies in nano models. Quantum computing represents both a challenge and an opportunity.   Defining a qubit A qubit, a quantum bit, has a physical counterpart. For example, a quantum state can be encoded in oscillating currents with a superconductor loops. Google and IBM have experimented with this approach. Another way is to encode a qubit in an ion trapped in an electromagnetic field in a vacuum trap.  Photons, electrons, the state of light, and other technologies have emerged. Whatever the approach, calculations with 50+ qubit quantum computers will outrun classical supercomputers.  The competition is fierce because the market will rapidly become huge. Get ready now to face the disruption that's coming!  Representing a qubit The mathematical representation of a qubit is:  0 cid:109  for a 0 value 1 cid:109  for a 1 value  cid:110 0 cid:109  where alpha is a probability parameter  cid:111 1 cid:109  where beta is a probability parameter  These brackets are called bracket or bra-ket notation.  This linear representation is called superposition. In itself, it explains most of the power of quantum computing.   [ 396 ]   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  The superposition of 0 and 1 in a quantum state can thus be expressed as follows in kets such as 1> and not bras such as in <1:  The alpha and beta probabilities look like weights and the total probabilities of those probable states of qubit must add up to 1. We use partition functions, softmax, and other techniques to make sure to keep the sum of probabilities equal to 1. This is no surprise since computers geek like us designed the way to program quantum computers. Translated into mathematics, this means that the probabilities of  cid:110  and  cid:111  must add up to 1. In the case of qubit probabilities, the values are squared, leading to the following constraint:  To describe the probable state of a qubit, we thus need three numbers: the 0 and 1 possible states and a number to determine the value of the probabilities  the other is implicit since the total must add up to 1 .  Since qubits interact in their respective states, an interaction is described as an entanglement. An entanglement designates at least two interacting qubits. They cannot be described without taking all the states of all the qubits into account.   This has been reproduced physically, which means that this entanglement seems strange because their quantum entanglement  relation  can occur at a distance. One qubit can influence a qubit that is physically far away.  Albert Einstein called entanglement "spooky action at a distance."  The position of a qubit  One of the main ways to represent the state of a qubit is a Bloch's sphere. It shows how a qubit spins and can be used to describe qubit states. The following section refreshes some properties of a circle.  [ 397 ]   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  Radians, degrees, and rotations The radius is the distance between the center of a circle and its circumference, as shown in the following diagram:  The radius of a circle is half of the circle's diameter. The relation between the radius r and the circumference C is  where  cid:100 =3.14 :  If the length of the radius is wrapped around the circumference of a circle, that arc forms a radian, as shown in the following diagram:  The angle formed by a radian is equal to about 57.29 cid:102   degrees .  [ 398 ]   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  The properties of the radian can be used for rotations:  3,14 x 57,29 cid:112  = about 180 cid:112   thus  cid:113  radians = 180  Rotations are often described by radians expressed in  cid:113 , as displayed in the following table:  Degrees Radians 30 cid:112  45 cid:112  60 cid:112  90 cid:112  180 cid:112  270 cid:112  360 cid:112    cid:100  6  cid:100  4  cid:100  3  cid:100  2  cid:100  3 cid:100  2 2 cid:100   Bloch sphere The radian table shown just now is a practical way to describe rotations. A Bloch sphere, as shown in the following figure, provides a visual representation of the position and rotation of a qubit:  [ 399 ]   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  The North and South pole  polar coordinates  represent the basic states of a qubit:   A qubit can take any value on the sphere.  Composing a quantum score  Composing a quantum score consists of positioning gates on a stave  or circuit  and adding a measurement. The input comes from a classical computer. After the measurement phase, the output goes back to a classical computer. The reason is that quantum computers have no memory and thus cannot store their intermediate states because of their instability.   This section uses Quirk, a very educative quantum circuit simulator, to present quantum gates and a quantum composer.  Quantum gates with Quirk  The qubits are represented by the lines, and they start on the left, as shown in following quantum gate programming interface:  [ 400 ]   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  The gates are logic gates that will transform the state of the qubits:  Not gate: A not gate will transform a ket-zero 0 cid:109  into a ket-one 1 cid:109 . It will transform a ket-one 1 cid:109  into a ket-zero0 cid:109 .   In circuit description,  cid:80  cid:79  is the ket-one state and  cid:80  cid:71  cid:71  is the ket-zero state, as shown in the following quantum score:  You can see that:  H gate  A not gate symbol is a circle with a vertical and horizontal line inside it The on status means that the state is 1 cid:109  The Bloch Sphere representation is at  cid:113   starting from the top of the Bloch sphere  as it should  An H gate, or Hadamard Gate will perform the following transformation:  [ 401 ]   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  The following 50% chance will be displayed in a rectangle and the position on the Bloch sphere as well:  The fundamental role of a gate is to turn the qubits on a Bloch sphere and produce a probable condition if measured. There are many possible gates to be explored and used, as shown in this design menu diagram:  These gates are more than enough to build many algorithms.  A quantum computer score with Quirk  Building a quantum score  or circuit  with Quirk means the following:  Dragging and dropping gates that will make a qubit turn in a specific direction and produce probable outcomes Adding another qubit, doing the same, and so on Being able to perform an intermediate measurement, although this is impossible for a real physical quantum computer  the observations make the system collapse   [ 402 ]   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  A score is represented as follows, for example:  There are two qubits with a gate on each line to start. Then the intermediate result is shown, making the simulator very educational. Then two more gates are added. Finally, the following measurement probe is added at the end:  Once the measurement is made, the final result is displayed on the right of the measurement symbols.  A quantum computer score with IBM Q  IBM Q provides a cloud platform to run a real physical quantum computer.  [ 403 ]   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  Create a free account and access the IBM quantum computing composer. Just as with Quirk, quantum gates are dragged on the following score, as shown in this diagram:  The score can be run on a simulator like Quirk or a real quantum computer, as shown in this interface diagram:  Click on Simulate which will runs a simulator.  Run launches a calculation on IBM's physical quantum computer. It is an exhilarating experience! The future is at the tip of your fingers.  [ 404 ]   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  The following output is interesting. It is a bit different from Quirk for the same score, but the probabilities add up to 1 as expected:  IBM also possesses a source code version  QASM  of the score, as shown in the following code:   cid:74  cid:79  cid:68  cid:77  cid:86  cid:69  cid:70  cid:2  cid:4  cid:82  cid:70  cid:77  cid:74  cid:67  cid:19  cid:16  cid:74  cid:79  cid:68  cid:4  cid:29   cid:82  cid:83  cid:70  cid:72  cid:2  cid:82  cid:60  cid:23  cid:62  cid:29   cid:68  cid:83  cid:70  cid:72  cid:2  cid:68  cid:60  cid:23  cid:62  cid:29   cid:73  cid:2  cid:82  cid:60  cid:18  cid:62  cid:29   cid:91  cid:2  cid:82  cid:60  cid:19  cid:62  cid:29   cid:90  cid:2  cid:82  cid:60  cid:18  cid:62  cid:29   cid:89  cid:2  cid:82  cid:60  cid:19  cid:62  cid:29   cid:78  cid:70  cid:66  cid:84  cid:86  cid:83  cid:70  cid:2  cid:82  cid:60  cid:18  cid:62  cid:2  cid:15  cid:32  cid:2  cid:68  cid:60  cid:18  cid:62  cid:29   cid:78  cid:70  cid:66  cid:84  cid:86  cid:83  cid:70  cid:2  cid:82  cid:60  cid:19  cid:62  cid:2  cid:15  cid:32  cid:2  cid:68  cid:60  cid:19  cid:62  cid:29   [ 405 ]   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  This language is an Open Quantum Assembly Language. It can be written in an editor like any other language on IBM Q's platform. A development kit can also be downloaded, and the APIs are functional.  All of this being said, let's find out how quantum computing can boost an AI project. It is now time to define the thinking quantum computer project.  A thinking quantum computer A thinking quantum computer is not a reproduction of brain function but a representation of the mind of a person. Neuroscientists are making progress on using machine learning to understand the brain. But artificial intelligence mostly uses algorithms that simulate our way of thinking, not our brain's functions.  The endeavor of the Quantum MindX experiment is to build a personal mind named MindX, with memories of past events, conversations, chats, photographies, and more as described in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:24 , Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots.   This section describes how to build MindX, a thinking computer. It is not the project itself, which would be beyond the scope of the book. I've been doing research on this subject for many years. The power of quantum computation will no doubt boost research in this field.  All the diagram in this section are part of the datasets used by the programs provided with the book  see Technical requirements section . You can also view the video showing the program running.  Representing our mind's concepts   A conceptual representation learning meta model  CRLMM  can be implemented with a quantum computer.  The input consists of encoding a state of mind of a PCA CRLMM representation. The CRLMM representation is not a general dictionary or encyclopedia dataset but a mind- dataset of actual personal data that is collected, classified, and transformed into a PCA 3D view as described in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:24 , Improving the Emotional Intelligence of Chatbots.  [ 406 ]   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  The following diagram is an extraction of some of the words and concepts that the mind of person X picked up by reading this book:  This person's mind added to other information gathered in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:24 , Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots will now be in the mind of MindX.  A frame of MindX's PCA state will be submitted to a quantum computer. The quantum computer will then think as humans do, by associating concepts, mental images, sounds, sensations, feelings, and everything that makes up our mind. The result will be decoded into coordinates of the PCA CRLMM representation of the machine's mind and will produce a sentence.  The sequence is thus a classical computer input, a quantum computer calculation, and a classical computer interpretation of the output.  The input and outputs can be as follows:  Connected to a chatbot Used for CRLMM decision-making purposes as seen in previous chapters  [ 407 ]   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  Expanding MindX's conceptual representations  MindX's mind dataset will grow continuously if implemented beyond this research experiment. It will have sensors to process body temperature for emotion classification, facial recognition for expression detection, body language detectors, and more. All of this technology is already available.   cid:38  cid:46  cid:35  cid:38  cid:37  cid:37  cid:42  cid:47  cid:40  cid:64  cid:42  cid:46  cid:34  cid:40  cid:38  cid:52  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  contains one of the first methods of enriching the mind-dataset of MindX to obtain concepts. A version was presented in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:24 , Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots. This version was built with a larger mind-dataset.  The following is a screenshot of the PCA TensorBoard Projector 3D representation of a mind:  A sample dataset of concepts based on personal experience, and not general data, has been created. Some samples were generated by CRLMM CNN classification  see previous chapters ; some were created for this sample. But all can be generated automatically using the program in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:24 , Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots.  [ 408 ]   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  Concepts in the mind-dataset of MindX For the quantum MindX experiment, some personal concepts of MindX have been created.  Positive thinking To think, a mind must have memories and personal ideas. The following screenshot comes from the sprite generated by  cid:38  cid:46  cid:35  cid:38  cid:37  cid:37  cid:42  cid:47  cid:40  cid:64  cid:42  cid:46  cid:34  cid:40  cid:38  cid:52  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90   see the following section . A sprite is an image that contains thumbnails: small images of the dataset. Once loaded into TensorBoard Projector with their features, they will be represented in a 3D mind projection as displayed in this diagram:  [ 409 ]   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  As you can see,  the following is true about MindX:  It has superposed words and images, associating them to form memories. A field of flowers has become a field of love, forming a positive memory.  It has memorized parking space available, picked up in this book as something very positive as well. A person who has been looking for a parking space for some time in a big city feels blessed to have found an available space. It has associated motivation with positive words and put the face of a colleague on the concept.  It will continuously enrich the mind-dataset through everyday experience and memories and store the decisions  good or bad  made.  Negative thinking To think, a mind must accept negative thinking and have feelings. A positive feeling is felt by contrast with a negative feeling. A positive thought is felt by contrast to a negative feeling.  Empathy is based on the ability to feel both positive and negative feelings. Otherwise, the mind is only half of a mind.  As you can see MindX does not pretend to be 100% perfect and positive; 100% efficiency may be good for optimizing like a machine but it certainly does not exist in humans. MindX has weaknesses and it knows this. This is what makes MindX a powerful thinking and feeling entity.  [ 410 ]   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  MindX is nearly human, so it can have negative thoughts. The following screenshot of the PCA Tensorbard Projection of MindX shows negative feelings:   cid:2   MindX, as in the positive PCA area:  Has doubts. Can think better with this very useful dimension  avoiding a mistake, being careful, self-interrogation, or reconsidering an opinion on another person . MindX will be more sensitive and sensible. Has, on the left of doubts, cracks appearing close by in the gap area. Doubts images are near the fields of love positive thoughts appear by contrast. Associating different types of concepts is what makes a mind deep.  In MindX, as in humans, doubts are often not flaws but ways of reconsidering a decision more deeply.  [ 411 ]   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  Gaps Gaps constitute a major concept in a mind's way of thinking cid:100 something missing, the concept of insufficient, a gap between people, a gap in factory goals, and many more concepts  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:19 , Conceptual Representation Learning .  The following image is a TensorBoard screenshot of the gap features of MindX's representation of its environment:  MindX has associated gaps with cracks, abstract holes in the sky, holes in rocks, "mind the gap" messages in cities, and cracks in the earth.  Distances MindX has acquired experience and dreams of distances.  [ 412 ]   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  The following image is a TensorBoard screenshot of MindX's representation of distances:  MindX has memories of "freedom roads," and sea travel. It has associated horizons, hope, and love to distances and travel. MindX has MDP graphs in mind and much more.  The embedding program  cid:38  cid:46  cid:35  cid:38  cid:37  cid:37  cid:42  cid:47  cid:40  cid:64  cid:42  cid:46  cid:34  cid:40  cid:38  cid:52  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  has started the MindX Quantum experiment with four main classes and 4,096 dimensions. This dataset can be automatically enhanced using the solutions described in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:24 , Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots.  The human brain has a maximum of around 100,000,000,000 neurons  100 billion , which is a small number compared to what we saw a quantum computer could manage in one calculation.  [ 413 ]   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  Of course, human neurons combine and do a lot more than just being a mass of neurons. But this means that expanding the mind-dataset of MindX beyond any human being's capacity is possible today with the right parameters. MindX could be represented by an endless number of separate PCA feature sets connected in the largest personal mind that ever existed. The following code in Python starts by loading the four classes of data described before:   cid:74  cid:78  cid:72  cid:64  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:31  cid:60  cid:62   cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:84  cid:70  cid:85  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:64  cid:69  cid:74  cid:83  cid:64  cid:77  cid:74  cid:84  cid:85  cid:28   cid:74  cid:78  cid:72  cid:64  cid:77  cid:74  cid:84  cid:85  cid:31  cid:80  cid:84  cid:16  cid:77  cid:74  cid:84  cid:85  cid:69  cid:74  cid:83  cid:10  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:64  cid:81  cid:66  cid:85  cid:73  cid:13  cid:9  cid:17  cid:9  cid:13  cid:2  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:84  cid:70  cid:85  cid:11   cid:81  cid:83  cid:74  cid:79  cid:85  cid:2  cid:10  cid:9  cid:45  cid:80  cid:66  cid:69  cid:70  cid:69  cid:2  cid:85  cid:73  cid:70  cid:2  cid:74  cid:78  cid:66  cid:72  cid:70  cid:84  cid:2  cid:80  cid:71  cid:2  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:84  cid:70  cid:85  cid:15  cid:9  cid:13  cid:9  cid:92  cid:94  cid:61  cid:79  cid:9  cid:16  cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:78  cid:66  cid:85  cid:10  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:84  cid:70  cid:85  cid:11  cid:11   cid:71  cid:80  cid:83  cid:2  cid:74  cid:78  cid:72  cid:2  cid:74  cid:79  cid:2  cid:74  cid:78  cid:72  cid:64  cid:77  cid:74  cid:84  cid:85  cid:28   cid:74  cid:79  cid:81  cid:86  cid:85  cid:64  cid:74  cid:78  cid:72  cid:31  cid:68  cid:87  cid:20  cid:16  cid:74  cid:78  cid:83  cid:70  cid:66  cid:69  cid:10  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:64  cid:81  cid:66  cid:85  cid:73  cid:2  cid:13  cid:2  cid:9  cid:17  cid:9  cid:13  cid:2  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:84  cid:70  cid:85  cid:2  cid:13  cid:2  cid:9  cid:17  cid:9  cid:13  cid:2  cid:74  cid:78  cid:72  cid:2  cid:11   cid:74  cid:79  cid:81  cid:86  cid:85  cid:64  cid:74  cid:78  cid:72  cid:64  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:74  cid:91  cid:70  cid:2  cid:31  cid:2  cid:68  cid:87  cid:20  cid:16  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:74  cid:91  cid:70  cid:10  cid:74  cid:79  cid:81  cid:86  cid:85  cid:64  cid:74  cid:78  cid:72  cid:14  cid:2  cid:10  cid:24  cid:22  cid:14  cid:24  cid:22  cid:11  cid:11   cid:74  cid:78  cid:72  cid:64  cid:69  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:16  cid:66  cid:81  cid:81  cid:70  cid:79  cid:69  cid:10  cid:74  cid:79  cid:81  cid:86  cid:85  cid:64  cid:74  cid:78  cid:72  cid:64  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:74  cid:91  cid:70  cid:11   A MindX project requires many more classes and subsets.

MindX is now ready to think with a quantum computer.  [ 415 ]   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  The MindX experiment The aim of the Quantum MindX experiment is to build a mind and let it think with the power of a quantum computer. This section will show how to run a 16-qubit mind.  The size of numbers needed to describe a 16-qubit quantum simulation is 65,536.  The section first describes how to do the following:  Prepare the data Create and run a quantum score Use the output  Preparing the data  To prepare data for higher dimension calculations, I have been using a concept encoding method for corporate projects for 30+ years to provide embedded data to the algorithms I developed. This guarantees high-level abstraction to solve problems. It is a very profitable way to implement transfer learning and domain learning. This way, you can apply the same model to many different fields.  The method consists of embedding data with the methods described in this book. The goal always remains the same cid:100 to transform the data points into higher dimensions to visualize features.  For quantum computing, the method remains the same for the MindX experiment.  Transformation Functions  cid:97  the situation function  The mind dataset that has been built in the past chapters through CRLMM has undergone PCA   cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:24 , Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots  transformation. Variances, covariances, covariance matrices, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and then feature vectors were applied to the data.   Now two functions need to be applied before creating and running a score: a situation function and a quantum transformation function.  The situation function consists of building a vector of features in PCA dimensions. In  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:24 , Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots, the chatbot was able to use person X's mind-dataset to suggest a movie. In this chapter, MindX now is that person.  [ 416 ]   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  This chatbot has a nascent personal mind, not a general mind that can recognize, classify, and predict like a machine. MindX has a mind that is biased by its way of thinking like humans. MindX has an exceptionally open mind to adapt to everyone, which gives it empathy.  MindX can doubt. Thus it can learn better than dogmatic machines.  A situation function will create a situation matrix for a movie suggestion by the MindX bot that will communicate with consumers. In a movie suggestion situation by the MindX bot, for example, it could be something as follows for 16 qubits:  Qubit Concept 1 2 3 4 5  cities darkness nostalgia worrying job  cid:114  consider movie "Lost" decision to suggest"Lost"  15 16  Initial polarity 0.146 0.5 0.5  Image parking dark forest autumn leaves dark background 0.146 sad face ..  0.5 .. 0.38 0.0  MindX is not analyzing person X anymore. It has now loaded an empathy matrix from its mind-dataset that contains the actual images of the dataset used in this chapter and represented in PCA TensorBoard Projector. MindX loads its mind plus the mind of another person.  Empathy colors your thoughts and feelings with the thoughts and feelings of another person.  The 16-qubit matrix shown just now contains four columns:  Qubit: The line for this qubit on the quantum composer Concept: The concept loaded in MindX's situation dataset  [ 417 ]   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  Image: The actual image in the dataset Initial polarity: The sentiment analysis of MindX's profile  see  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:24 , Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots   The first lines  1 to 5  show that MindX has perceived the person X as a bit sad and disappointed. The last two lines 15 and 16  show that MindX thinks that maybe the movie Lost would please person X.  Before suggesting the movie named Lost, MindX needs to think about it. For the moment, MindX seems reluctant to suggest the movie Lost.   This movie example is for explaining how to create a thinking, empathetic chatbot. This approach can be applied to other commercial market segments or any situation in which a chatbot is required to think beyond preset answers.  Transformation functions  cid:97  the quantum function The situation function has produced a qubit line number with labels  concepts and images . Each line also possesses a sentiment analysis polarity expressed in normalized values from 0 to 1 in probabilistic format. Negative is close to 0, positive close to 1, and the intermediate values give a more detailed approximation. 0.4 to 0.6 is a turning point.  This first transformation into another dimension is the first step to initialize quantum transformation function. The quantum transformation function consists in initializing the first column of all 16 qubits with a quantum gate.  Just like datasets were transformed into principal component features, the polarity transformation function enables the quantum transformation function to bring the dataset into a quantum universe.  The function will automatically find the quantum gates which represent the normalized sentiment analysis polarity of the data points of the following situation matrix:  Initial polarity Quantum gate 0.146 0.5 0.5 0.146  X1 4 X1 2 X1 2 X1 4  [ 418 ]   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  0.5 .. 0.38 0.0  X1 2  X1 8 Z1 8  The situation matrix and its concepts have now been transformed into a quantum dimension, in which the data status can be traced throughout the creation of the quantum score.  Creating and running the score A thought process of MindX is described in a quantum score. There are two ways to build this score :  Manually, just like a musician writing a music score. This requires thinking about the previous logic gate and the effect of the next one, taking a decision process into account. It is like writing any artificial intelligence program. Automatically, by building a function that reads a rule base of MindX's way of thinking and applies the quantum gates through that rule base.  In any case, it requires writing an algorithm. This algorithm is a decision-making algorithm that takes emotions into account. Doubt, for example, is what keeps many humans from making wrong decisions. Too much doubt, for example, will make a person back out from that situation.  Here is the quantum transcription of such an algorithm that takes MindX's concepts into account and represents how they interact. This requires very precise thinking and cognitive science programming.  [ 419 ]   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  The following is an experimental quantum score I built with Quirk:  Once the quantum score has been run and the measurement made, the green rectangles on the right provide the output.  Using the output The output of the quantum score is now added as a column to the situation matrix. MindX has now attained the right to be a cognitive NLP chatbot. MindX has proven its cognitive abilities.  Qubit Concept  Image  1 2  cities darkness  parking dark forest  0.146 0.5  Initial Normalized Polarity expressed in quantum gate form  Quantum output directly interpreted as sentiment analysis polarity 0.677 0.691  [ 420 ]   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  3 4 5  15 16  nostalgia worrying job  cid:114  consider movie "Lost" decision to suggest"Lost"  0.5  autumn leaves dark background 0.146 sad face ..  0.5 .. 0.38 0.0  0.5 0.48 0.36  0.82 0.75  MindX has given a 65,536 quantum state description of its thoughts about suggesting a given movie to person X. Lines 15 and 16 show that the normalized polarity value has risen over 0.5 to a positive feeling about the movie.   The reasoning is that the first lines show that MindX feels person X's doubts about life at that moment:  That person X will identify to the "Lost" concept  The movie has a happy ending  MindX knows that through the features of the movie  That person X's spirits will be most probably lifted after watching the movie  IBM Watson and scripts With that output, the program can activate an IBM Watson movie-choice dialog created by the company who wants to optimize marketing chatbots as shown in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:23 , Cognitive NLP Chatbots.

Can I help you?" PersonX: Why not?  MindX: Well, feel some doubts myself about things right now. PersonX: What??? MindX: Oh, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm MindX a Quantum Mind program. I can think and feel. I'm not just about statistics and predictions. PersonX: Wow! MindX: Anyway, I was saying that I have some doubts myself and a movie called 'Lost' reflects my frame of mind. What do you think?  [ 421 ]   Quantum Computers That Think  Chapter 17  PersonX: "Why would a movie like that  lines 15 and 16 of the situation matrix  be good for me?" MindX: Mmmm. Let me think a minute...  the quantum score runs  MindX: Ok.  the quantum score is over  MindX: I thought about it. Ok. I feel doubts today also, but the movie is all about people that are Lost and trying to find there way in life. I can't tell you more, but it looks exciting!. Do you see what I mean? PersonX: I sure do! But first, tell me more about you please! MindX: ....the rest of the IBM Watson dialog + AI Scripts + Quantum thinking scores...  Summary Quantum computers have opened the door to scientific experiments that could never have been carried out with classical computers. Within a few years, quantum computers will have become mainstream, unavoidable, and a key asset for businesses and research labs. The race has begun to conquer the market.  CRLMM applied to quantum computers could make MindX one of the most powerful thinking minds on earth, human or machine.  With an unlimited mind-dataset and a 2q quantum computer starting at 250, a 50-qubit machine, MindX could gain the thinking power and experience of a human who would have lived 1,000 years. MindX's thinking power and an exponential amount of real-time memory of past experiences, loaded through transformation functions, could help solve many medical, logistic, and other decision-making problems.  Quantum thinking has just begun to change the perception of the world. Then, DNA-based computers will appear with new perspectives. Conceptual AI models such as CRLMM will no doubt be the starting point of the next generation of AI solutions. These CRLMM models will be much more powerful because they will be gifted with empathy and complex minds.  Artificial intelligence has only begun its long journey into our lives. Always trust innovations. Never trust a solution that solves a problem without opening the door to a universe of questions and ideas!

Is reinforcement learning memoryless?  Yes  No   The answer is yes. Reinforcement learning is memoryless. The agent calculates the next state without looking into the past. This is significantly different to humans. Humans rely heavily on memory. A CPU-based reinforcement learning system finds solutions without experience. Human intelligence merely proves that intelligence can solve a problem. No more, no less. An adaptive thinker can then imagine new forms of machine intelligence.  2. Does reinforcement learning use stochastic  random  functions?  Yes  No   The answer is yes. In the particular Markov Decision Process model, the choices are random. In just two questions, you can see that the Bellman equation is memoryless and makes random decisions. No human reasons like that. Being an adaptive thinker is a leap of faith. You will have to leave who you were behind and begin to think in terms of equations.  3. Is the Markov Decision Process based on a rule base?  The answer is no. Human rule base experience is useless in this process. Furthermore, the Markov Decision Process provides efficient alternatives to long consulting times with future users that cannot clearly express their problem.  4. Is the Q function based on the Markov Decision Process?  Yes  No   The answer is yes. The use of the expression "Q" appeared around the time the Bellman equation, based on the Markov Decision Process, came into fashion. It is more trendy to say you are using a Q function than to speak about Bellman, who put all of this together in 1957. The truth is that Andrey Markov was Russian and applied this method in 1913 using a dataset of 20,000 letters to predict future use of letters in a novel. He then extended that to a dataset of 100,000 letters. This means that the theory was there 100 years ago. Q fits our new world of impersonal and powerful CPUs.   Answers to the Questions  5. Is mathematics essential to artificial intelligence?  Yes  No   The answer is yes. If you master the basics of linear algebra and probability, you will be on top of all the technology that is coming. It is worth spending a few months on the subject in the evening or taking a MOOC. Otherwise, you will depend on others to explain things to you.  6. Can the Bellman-MDP process in this chapter apply to many problems?  Yes  No   The answer is yes. You can use this for robotics, market analysis, IoT, linguistics, and scores of other problems.  7. Is it impossible for a machine learning program to create another program by itself?  Yes  No   The answer is no. It is not impossible. It has already been done by Google with AutoML. Do not be surprised. Now that you have become an adaptive thinker and know that these systems rely on equations, not humans, you can easily understand that mathematical systems are not that difficult to reproduce.  8. Is a consultant required to enter business rules in a reinforcement learning program?  Yes  No   The answer is no. It is only an option. Reinforcement learning in the MDP process is memoryless and random. Consultants are there to manage, explain, and train in these projects.  9. Is reinforcement learning supervised or unsupervised?  Supervised  Unsupervised   The answer is unsupervised. The whole point is to learn from unlabeled data. If the data is labeled, then we enter the world of supervised learning; that will be searching for patterns and learning them. At this point, you can easily see you are at sea in an adventure cid:100 a memoryless, random, and unlabeled world for you to discover.  10. Can Q Learning run without a reward matrix?  Yes  No   The answer is no. A smart developer could always find a way around this, of course. The system requires a starting point. You will see in the second chapter that it is quite a task to find the right reward matrix in real-life projects.  [ 425 ]   Answers to the Questions  Chapter 2  cid:97  Think like a Machine  1. The concept of using an artificial neuron was discovered in 1990.  Yes  No   The answer is no. Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts invented the first neuron and published a paper in 1943. Legend has it that at age 12 years in 1935, Walter Pitts, a poor child living in a bad neighborhood, was chased by bullies and sought refuge in a library. There he discovered Principia Mathematica by Bertrand Russell and Alfred Whitehead. Anyway, not only did he find mistakes in the reasoning, but also he sent a letter to Bertrand Russell! From then on, Walter was noted for his genius in mathematics. With Waren McCulloch, another genius, they invented the first neuron. It seems simple. But it's the result of sleepless nights. Just as the invention of the wheel appears simple, nothing better has been found to this day. This concept of a the neuron is the wheel of artificial intelligence.  2. Does a McCulloch-Pitts neuron require a threshold?  Yes  No   The answer is yes. Adding up weights does not mean much if you do not have something to measure the value. It took months of work for McCulloch and Pitt to put this together. At first, time was in the equation, just like it is in our brain. But then, like Joseph Fourier  1768-1830 , they found cycles that repeated themselves cid:100 periods that did not require much more than that neuron.   3. A logistic sigmoid activation function makes the sum of the weights larger.  Yes  No   The answer is no. The whole point is to reduce the sums when necessary to have comparable numbers to work with.  4. A McCulloch-Pitts neuron sums the weights of its inputs.  Yes  No   The answer is yes. It's only when you sum the weights that they make sense.  5. A logistic sigmoid function is a log10 operation?  Yes  No   The answer is no. The sigmoid function is based on Euler's number, e, a constant that is equal to 2.71828. This number produces a natural logarithm. Leonhard Euler  1707-1783  discovered this in the 18th century with a quill cid:100 no scientific calculator or computer! Did you notice that the main mathematical functions used in artificial intelligence run far back in history? This aspect of the hype around what we think we have found now but has existed for decades, and sometimes centuries, will be dealt with in the following chapters.  [ 426 ]   Answers to the Questions  6. A Logistic Softmax is not necessary if a logistic sigmoid function is applied to a vector.  Yes  No   The answer is no. Calculating the sum of several numbers of a vector and then dividing each number by that sum gives a view of the proportions involved. It is a precious tool to keep in mind.  7. A probability is a value between -1 and 1.  Yes  No   The answer is no. Probabilities lie between 0 and 1.  Chapter 3  cid:97  Apply Machine Thinking to a Human Problem 1. Can a human beat a chess engine?  Yes  No   The answer is no. Today, the highest level chess tournaments are not between humans but between chess engines. Each chess engine software editor prepares for these competitions by making their algorithms faster and requiring less CPU. In fact today, a top chess engine running on a smartphone can beat humans. In human-to-human chess competitions, the level of chess has reached very high limits of complexity. Humans now mostly train against machines.  2. Humans can estimate decisions better than machines with intuition when it comes to large volumes of data.  Yes  No   The answer is no. The sheer CPU power of an average machine or even a smartphone can generate better results than humans with the proper algorithms.  3. Building a reinforcement learning program with a Q function is a feat in itself. Using the results afterward is useless.  Yes  No   The answer is no. While learning artificial intelligence, just verifying the results are correct is enough. In real-life applications, the results are used in databases or as input to other systems.   [ 427 ]   Answers to the Questions  4. Supervised learning Decision Tree functions can be used to verify that the result of the unsupervised learning process will produce reliable, predictable results.  Yes  No   The answer is yes. Decision Tree functions are not intelligent, but they are very efficient in many cases. When large volumes are involved, Decision Tree functions can be used to analyze the results of the machine learning process and contribute to a prediction process.  5. The results of a reinforcement learning program can be used as input to a scheduling system by providing priorities.  Yes  No   The answer is yes. The output of reinforcement learning Q function can, in fact, be injected as input into another Q function. Several results and be consolidated in phase 1 and become the reward matrix of a phase 2 reinforcement learning session.  6. Artificial intelligence software thinks like humans.  Yes  No   The answer is yes and no. In early days, this was attempted with neuroscience-based models. However, applying mathematical models is presently far more efficient. Pretending otherwise at this point is hype. Who knows what will happen in future research? But for the time being, deep learning, the main trend, is based on mathematical functions.  Chapter 4  cid:97  Become an Unconventional Innovator 1. Can the perceptron alone solve the XOR problem?   Yes  No   The answer was no in 1969. A neural network, or some other mathematical process, is necessary to solve this problem. For the record, this is a common problem for electric circuits that function with "feedforward" electricity, and was solved long ago.  [ 428 ]   Answers to the Questions  2. Is the XOR function linearly separable?   Yes  No   The answer is no if you use a single neuron and yes if you use a hidden layer with at least two neurons. That is a major problem to address in deep learning. If you cannot separate the features of a face, for example, in a picture, recognizing that face will prove difficult. Imagine a picture with one half of the face in shadow and the other half in bright sunlight. Since the eye and features of one half are in shadow, a poor deep learning program might only capture half of the face, separating the face in the wrong place with a poor edge detection function. Linear separability is thus a key aspect of machine learning.  3. One of the main goals of layers in a neural network is classification.  Yes  No   The answer is yes. Once the data is identifiable with a given neural network architecture, predictions, and many other functions become possible. The key to deep learning is to be able to transform data into pieces of information that will make sense.  4. Is deep learning the only way to classify data?  Yes  No   The answer is no. You can classify data with an SQL query, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and standard source code. Deep learning becomes vital when many dimensions of classification are involved: first finding the edges of objects in a picture, then forms, and then determining what the object represents. To do this with millions of pictures is beyond the scope of standard programming or early AI and ML programs.  5. A cost function shows the increase in the cost of neural network.   Yes  No   The answer is no. A cost function determines how much the training costs you. Running 100,000 epochs is more expensive than running 50,000 epochs. So at each epoch, the cost of training  how far the system is from its goal  must be estimated. Thus, a good cost function will decrease the cost of running a neural network.  6. Can simple arithmetic be enough to optimize a cost function?  Yes  No   The answer is yes. As long as you know to what extent your cost function is increasing or decreasing, anything that works is fine.  7. A feedforward network requires inputs, layers, and an output.  Yes  No   The answer is yes. Without layers, there is no network.  [ 429 ]   Answers to the Questions  8. A feedforward network always requires training with backpropagation.  Yes  No   The answer is often yes in changing environments.. Since the field is new, we tend to think that once the training is done, the work is done. If the datasets are very stable in a repetitive environment, such as recognizing the difference between various constant products in a shop, warehouse or factory, then the neural network will do the classification it is designed for. If new products are introduced, then training can be initiated again.  9. In real-life applications, solutions are only found by respecting academic theory.  Yes  No   The answer is no. Without academic research, deep learning would not even exist. Without universities, the ideas used would be so simple that they would never work well. On the other hand, researchers need real-life feedback. If we find new ways of doing things they recommended, we should publish them to help global research. It's a two-way street.  Chapter 5  cid:97  Manage the Power of Machine Learning and Deep Learning 1. TensorBoard is simply a nice displaying program.  Yes  No   The answer is yes and no. Yes, TensorBoard is a friendly interface for visualizing a dataflow graph. No, TensorBoard is not only nice but is also critical to designing the architecture of a project even before the data feed aspect of the program is written. In real-life projects, a good architecture shows that you can manage the power of ML DL programs.   2. Defining functions at the beginning of the source code is just like standard programs.  Yes  No   No. Seeing variables and arrays at the beginning of a TensorFlow program could lead one to think that it is just a formality. However, these lines are in fact the real program, the dataflow graph, the architecture.    3. TensorFlow is a library add-on to Python that provides some cool functions.  Yes  No   The answer is no. It is a strategic tool for designing the dataflow graph of an application.  [ 430 ]   Answers to the Questions  4. TensorBoard is not necessary to deploy machine learning and deep learning programs.  Yes  No   The answer is yes. TensorBoard refreshes every n seconds automatically  this can be deactivated . When running large datasets during the training process, it is crucial to see whether the cost function is going up or down. And even if it is going down, converging to 0 or near 0, it is vital to see how fast the slope  gradient  is decreasing  descent .  5. As long as we're technical experts, we don't have to worry about our environment. It will adapt.  Yes  No   The answer is no. Those days are over. Our environment decides whether our project will survive or not. It is critical to developing not only code but also communication skills to defend ongoing projects.  6. Presenting ML DL projects doesn't change the architecture of a solution.  Yes  No   The answer is no. If the presentation has been well defined and made to the right people, the architecture can be tremendously improved by optimizing the datasets, training phase, test phase, and expected results.  7. Managers don't need to understand the technical aspect of a solution as long as it works.  Yes  No   The answer is no. This is a myth. It works early in a project, or in a dream world where projects never go wrong. But large projects always go wrong at some point because of dataset problems, bugs, communication tensions, sick leave, vacations, budget limitations, and scores of unexpected events. When that happens, communicating the key points and reasons of every aspect of the problem becomes essential.  Chapter 6  cid:97  Don't Get Lost in Techniques, Focus on Optimizing Your Solutions 1. Can a prototype be built with random data in corporate environments?  Yes  No   The answer is yes and no. To start developing a prototype, using random data can help make sure that the basic algorithm works as planned.  [ 431 ]   Answers to the Questions  However, once the prototype is advanced, it will be more reliable to use a well- designed dataset. Then, once the training has been successfully accomplished, random data can help again to see how your system behaves in all situations.  2. Do design matrices contain one example per matrix?  Yes  No   The answer is no. A good design matrix contains one example in each row or each column depending on the shape you want it to have. But be careful; a design matrix that contains data that is too efficient might overfit. That means the learning algorithm will be efficient with that data but not adapt to new data. On the other hand, if the dataset contains too many errors, then the algorithm might underfit, meaning it won't learn correctly. A good design matrix should contain reliable data, some imprecise data, and some noise  some data that can influence the algorithm in unreliable ways .  3. Automatic Guided Vehicle will never be widespread.  Yes  No   The answer is that AGVs will expand endlessly from now on: drones, cars, planes, warehouse vehicles, industrial vehicles, and more. AGVs, added to artificial intelligence and IoT, constitute the fourth industrial revolution.  4. Can k-means clustering be applied to drone traffic?  Yes  No   The answer is yes. Seeing where traffic builds up will prevent drone jams  drones circling and waiting .  5. Can k-means clustering be applied to forecasting?  Yes  No   The answer is yes and will be explained in  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:18 , Applying Biomimicking to Artificial Intelligence; it'll be applied to all types of traffic.  6. Lloyd's algorithm is a two-step approach.  Yes  No   Yes, Lloyd's algorithm first classifies each data point in the best cluster. Then, once that is done, it calculates the geometric center or centroid of that center.  When no data point changes the cluster anymore, the algorithm has been trained.  7. Do hyperparameters control the behavior of the algorithm?  Yes  No   The answer is yes. Hyperparameters determine the course of the computation: the number of clusters, features, batch sizes, and more.  [ 432 ]   Answers to the Questions  8. Once a program works, the way it is presented does not matter.  Yes  No   The answer is no. Without a clear presentation of the results, the whole training process is confusing at best and useless at worst.   9. K-means is only a classification algorithm. It's not a prediction algorithm.  Yes  No   The answer is no. K-means clustering can be used as a prediction algorithm as well.  Chapter 7  cid:97  When and How to Use Artificial Intelligence The questions will focus on the hyperparameters.  1. The number of k clusters is not that important.  Yes  No   The answer is no. The number of clusters requires careful selection, possibly a trial- and-error approach. Each project will lead to different clusters.  2. Mini-batches and batches contain the same amount of data.  Yes  No   The answer is no. "Batch" generally refers to the dataset and "mini-batch" represents a "subset" of data.  3. K-means can run without mini-batches.  Yes  No   The answer is yes and no. If the volume of data remains small, then the training epochs can run on the whole dataset. If the data volume exceeds a reasonable amount of computer power  CPU or GPU , mini-batches must be created to optimize training computation.  4. Must centroids be optimized for result acceptance?  Yes  No   The answer is yes and no. Suppose you want to put a key in a keyhole. The keyhole represents the centroid of your visual cluster. You must be precise. If you are simply throwing a piece of paper in your garbage can, you do not need to aim at the perfect center  centroid  of the cluster  marked by the rim of the garbage can  to attain that goal. Centroid precision depends on what is asked of the algorithm.  [ 433 ]   Answers to the Questions  5. It does not take long to optimize hyperparameters.  Yes  No   The answer is yes and no. If it's a simple project, it will not take long. If you are facing a large dataset, it will take some time to find the optimal hyperparameters.  6. Can it sometimes take weeks to train a large dataset?  Yes  No   The answer is yes. Media hype and hard work are two different worlds. Machine learning and deep learning are are still tough projects to implement.  7. AWS SageMaker only offers a k-means algorithm.  Yes  No   The answer is no. AWS Sagemaker offers a complete range of algorithms in the job creation interface. You can also use your algorithms choosing Custom.  [ 434 ]   Answers to the Questions  Chapter 8  cid:97  Revolutions Designed for Some Corporations and Disruptive Innovations for Small to Large Companies 1. It is better to wait until you have a top-quality product before putting it on the market.  Yes  No   The answer is yes and no. In the early 21st century, Airbus was struggling to complete the A380, the largest ever passenger airplane. Their engineers worked on hundreds of improvements before transporting commercial passengers. We would not expect less!  In the case of Google Translate, it is a massive no. By putting Google Translate online and providing an API, Google encouraged thousands of artificial intelligence developers, linguists, consultants and users to provide feedback and improvements. Furthermore, Google, once again, occupies a large share of the web market.   2. Considering the investment made, a new product should always be highly priced to reach the top segment of the market.  Yes  No   The answer is yes and no. When Ferrari puts a new car on the market, the price has to be high for two reasons; the quality of the car and cost of production make it necessary to do so to make the innovation profitable. Also, Ferrari avoids mass production to keep its quality at high levels.  When Amazon Web Services put machine learning on the market with SageMaker, it puts a "pay-as-you-go" policy in place, starting at a very low end of the market. The product had and has limits. But Amazon now has tremendous feedback and continuously improves the product.   3. Inventing a new solution will make it known in itself.  Yes  No   You might be surprised to know that saving a camera picture by drawing it dates so far back in history that nobody knows for sure when it was first used. Nobody knows if it was invented or discovered. In any case, the first camera obscura was revolutionary. It is now proven that famous painters used the technique. The picture was projected on a paper or canvas. The "printer" was manual. The painter was the "printer."  However, cameras as we know only become disruptive in the 20th century.  [ 435 ]   Answers to the Questions  4. Artificial intelligence can solve most problems without using standard non-learning algorithms.  Yes  No   The answer is no. Artificial intelligence relies on cloud servers, architectures, standard languages  C++, Java, Python, and others , and Apache servers. Even on a self-driving car, the sensors installed require standard hard work to get them working and interpreting information before AI comes in to solve some of the problems.  AI is like our brain. Without a body, it cannot function.  5 . Google Translate can translate all languages in a satisfactory way.  Yes  No   After reading this chapter, you might be surprised to have a yes and no answer. If you are using Google Translate to say "hello," "how are you," "thanks for the message," and similar friendly phrases on your favorite social network or in an email, it is good enough.   But when dealing with more detailed phrases and sentences, Google Translate provides random satisfactory results. From a user's perspective, this is bad news. For a developer, it is a goldmine!  6. If you are not creative, it is no use trying to innovate.  Yes  No   The answer is a massive no. You certainly do not need to be either imaginative or creative to innovate. Do not let anybody convince you of such nonsense.  If you are designing a solution and find a missing component, look for some alternative components on the web, talk about it, and find people that can help. Then get it done through teamwork. This works every time!  Even the great Bill Gates was smart enough to ask Tim Patterson for help to develop MS-DOS, and he went on to become a billionaire.  7. If you are not a linguist, it is no use bothering trying to improve Google Translate.  Yes  No   The answer is no! Once again, never let somebody convince you of such nonsense. Innovating is teamwork. If you like Google Translate and you understand this chapter and have ideas, team up with a linguist around you or through a social network. The world is yours to improve!  [ 436 ]   Answers to the Questions  8. Translation is too complicated to understand.  Yes  No   No. The way some explain it is too complicated. If you speak a language, you are an expert of translating your thoughts into words. With work, you can get into the translation business.   9. Artificial intelligence has already reached its limits.  Yes  No   Certainly not! We have just scratched the surface of both theory and applications.   Chapter 9  cid:97  Getting Your Neurons to Work  1. A convolutional neural network  CNN  can only process images.  Yes  No   The answer is no. CNNs can process words, sounds, or video sequences, to classify and predict.   2. A kernel is a preset matrix used for convolutions.  Yes  No   The answer is yes and no. There are many preset matrices used to process images such as the one used in  cid:70  cid:69  cid:72  cid:70  cid:64  cid:69  cid:70  cid:85  cid:70  cid:68  cid:85  cid:74  cid:80  cid:79  cid:64  cid:44  cid:70  cid:83  cid:79  cid:70  cid:77  cid:16  cid:81  cid:90  in this chapter. However, in this chapter, kernels were created randomly and then the network trained their weights to fit the target images.  3. Does pooling have a pooling matrix or is it random?  A pooling matrix has a size that is an option when the pooling layer is added to the model, such as a 2x2 pooling window.  4. The dataset always has to be large.  Yes  No   No. A dataset does not have a standard size. It depends on the training model. If the target images, for example, do not contain complex features, the dataset will be smaller than a complex feature dataset. Furthermore, the  cid:42  cid:78  cid:66  cid:72  cid:70  cid:37  cid:66  cid:85  cid:66  cid:40  cid:70  cid:79  cid:70  cid:83  cid:66  cid:85  cid:80  cid:83  function will expand the data by distorting it with the provided options.  5. Finding a dataset is not a problem with all the available image banks on the web.  Yes  No   The answer is yes and no. Yes because if the model remains a standard academic one, then the available images  CIFAR, MNIST, or others  will suffice.  [ 437 ]   Answers to the Questions  No, because in real-life corporate situations, you will have to build your dataset and add images containing noise. Noise requires more fine-tuning of the model to become reliable and generalized.  6. Once a CNN is built, training it does not take much time.  Yes  No   The answer is no. Whatever the model is, training will remain time-consuming if you want it to be reliable. As seen in this chapter, a model requires a lot of options and mathematical thinking.   7. A trained CNN model applies to only one type of image.  Yes  No   Yes and no. There are three main types of overfitting:  Overfitting a model for a certain type of images with absolutely no consequence of implementation. In this case, the model classifies and predicts enough to satisfy the goals set. Overfitting a model that creates implementation problems because it cannot adapt to different images of the same time. The model will then go through more training. Overfitting a model that trains a certain type of image quite well but does not fit similar types of images when needed.  Each situation has its constraints. As long as the model works, no general rules apply. It is up to you to decide.  8. A quadratic loss function is not very efficient compared to cross-entropy function.  Yes  No   The answer is no. Each model has its constraints. Quadratic loss functions work fine on some models and do not provide good results on others. This represents the main problems of training a model. No general rules will help you. You have to use your neurons or write a program that modifies the model automatically.  9. The performance of a deep learning CNN does not a represent a real issue with modern CPUs and GPUs.  Yes  No   The answer is yes and no. If the model runs quickly enough for your needs, then performance will not limit the outcome of your project. However, in many cases, it remains a problem. Reducing features to simply focus on the best ones is one of the reasons that the layers bring the size to analyze down, layer by layer.  [ 438 ]   Answers to the Questions  Chapter 10  cid:97  Applying Biomimicking to AI  1. Deep learning and machine learning mean the same thing.  Yes  No   No. When an  AI program contains a network, especially a deep one  with several layers , that is deep learning. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning.  When programs such as an Markov Decision Process  MDP  are used, that is machine learning.  To sum it up, not all artificial intelligence programs have to learn. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence programs that learn but do not require networks. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses networks.  2. Deep learning networks mostly reproduce human brain functions.  Yes  No   Yes in neuroscience research on the human brain. Computer models of the brain using deep learning can provide interesting models.  Sometimes yes, when deep learning networks try to reproduce human vision for image recognition applications.  No, when it comes many programs using statistics and probability for language processing, for example.  3. Overfitting is unacceptable.  Yes  No   Yes, when an application has been implemented and requires the ability to adapt constantly to new data.  No, when an application has been implemented, and the same images are submitted to the AI program.  No, when a prototype is first built and used as a proof of concept that the solution appears interesting.  4. Transfer learning can save the cost of building another model.  Yes  No   Yes. A reusable model can become quickly very profitable.  [ 439 ]   Answers to the Questions  5. Training a corporate model on MNIST is enough to implement it on a production line, for example.  Yes  No   Yes and no. Yes because if a model works on MNIST, it contains the proper functions to learn. No, because if the goal of the project is not close to MNIST data, it will not work. Experiment with MNIST in an image project that contains similar sorts of simple images.  6. Exploring artificial intelligence beyond the cutting edge is not necessary. It is easier to wait for the next ideas that are published.  Yes  No   Yes, when a team does not have ideas but excels in implementation, for example. GitHub can provide thousands of ideas, along with social networks, publications, and more.  No, when a team is creative and wants to occupy the market with innovations.  7. Some researchers have reproduced all the physical and biological reasoning functions of the human brain in robots. In fact, some robots have human brain clones in them.  Yes  No   No. Intelligent human-cloned robots only exist in fiction and social hype.  8. Artificial General Intelligence software, a program that can adapt to any human function  natural language processing, image processing, and sound streams  better than a human, already exists in some labs.  Yes  No   No. This will take much more time if it ever succeeds. Corporations might rather be satisfied with profits generated by narrow artificial intelligence that solves specific problems.  9. Training deep learning networks has become a quick and easy task.  Yes  No   No. Even if it appears fast and simple sometimes, it is mostly a tough task to build a network from scratch and get it to work properly.  [ 440 ]   Answers to the Questions  Chapter 11  cid:97  Conceptual Representation Learning 1. The curse of dimensionality leads to reducing dimensions and features in machine learning algorithms.  Yes  No   Yes. The volume of data and features makes it necessary to extract the main features of an observed event  an image, sound, and words  to make sense of it.  Overfitting and underfitting apply to dimensionality reduction as well. Reducing the features until the system works in a lab  overfitting  might lead to nowhere once the application faces real-life data. Trying to use all the features might lead to underfitting because the application solves no problem at all.   Regularization applies not just to data but to every aspect of a project.  2. Transfer learning determines the profitability of a project.  Yes  No   Yes if an application of an AI model in itself was unprofitable the first time but could generate profit if used for a similar type of learning. Reusing some functions would generate profit, no doubt.  No, if the first application was extremely profitable but "overfitted" to meet the specifications of a given project.  3. Reading model.h5 does not provide much information.  Yes  No   No. Saving the weights of a TensorFlow model is vital during the training process to control the values. Furthermore, trained models often use HDF files  .H5  to load the trained weights.  A Hierarchical Data Format  HDF  contains multidimensional arrays of scientific data.  4. Numbers without meaning are enough to replace humans.  Yes  No   Yes. In many cases, mathematics provides enough tools to replace humans for many tasks  games, optimization algorithms, and image recognition .  No. Sometimes mathematics cannot solve problems that require concepts such as many aspects of NLP.  [ 441 ]   Answers to the Questions  5. Chatbots prove that body language doesn't mean that much.  Yes  No   Yes. In many applications, body language does not provide additional information. If only a yes or no answer is required, body language will not add much to the conversation.  No. If emotional intelligence is required to understand the tone of the user of a chatbot, a webcam detecting body language could provide useful information.  6. Present-day ANNs provide enough theory to solve all AI requests.  Yes  No   No. Artificial Neural Networks  ANN  cannot solve thousands of problems, for example, translating poetry novels or recognizing images with forms that constantly vary.  7. Chatbots can now replace humans in all situations.  Yes  No   No. Concepts need to be added. The market provides all the necessary tools. It will take some years to be able to speak effectively with chatbots.  8. Self-driving cars have been approved and do not need conceptual training.  Yes  No   Yes, that could be true. Sensor, mathematics  linear algebra, probabilities  might succeed within a few years.  No. Certain problems will require concepts  and more robotics  when emergency situations that require creative solutions occur. If a self-driving car encounters a wounded person lying on the road, what is the best approach? The choices are to call for help, find another person if the help arrives too late, pick up the victim, drive them to a hospital  robotics , and much more.  9. Industries can implement AI algorithms for all of their needs.  Yes  No   Yes. All the tools are there to be used. If the right team decides to solve a problem with AI and robotics, it can be done.  No. Some tools are missing, such as real-time management decision tools when faced with unplanned events. If a system breaks down, humans can still adapt faster to find alternative solutions to continue production.  [ 442 ]   Answers to the Questions  Chapter 12  cid:97  Automated Planning and Scheduling 1  A CNN can be trained to understand an abstract concept.  Yes  No   Yes. A CNN can classify images and make predictions. But CNNs can analyze any type of object or representation. An image, for example, can be linked to a word or phrase. The image thus becomes a message in itself.  2. It is better to avoid concepts and only use real-life images.  Yes  No   No. Images provide many practical applications, but at some point, more is required to solve planning problems for example.  Planning requires much more than this type of dataset.   3. Planning and scheduling mean the same thing.  Yes  No   No. Planning describes the tasks that must be carried out. Scheduling adds a time factor. Planning tells us what to do, and scheduling tells us when.   4. Amazon's manufacturing patent is a revolution.  Yes  No   No. Manufacturing clothing has been mastered by factories around the world.  Yes. With such a worldwide distribution, Amazon has come very close to the end user. The end user can choose a new garment and it will be manufactured directly on demand. This connectivity will change the apparel manufacturing processes and force its competitors to find new ways of making and selling garments.  5. Learning how warehouses function is not useful.  Yes  No   No. False. Online shopping requires more and more warehouse space and processes. The number of warehouses will now increase faster than shops. There are many opportunities for artificial intelligence applications in warehouses.  6. Online marketing does not require artificial intelligence.  Yes  No   No. On the contrary, artificial intelligence is used by applications for online marketing every day, and this will continue for decades.  [ 443 ]   Answers to the Questions  Yes and No.  Chapter 13  cid:97  AI and the Internet of Things  1. Driving quickly to a location is better than safety in any situation.  Yes  No   Self-driving cars face the same difficulties as human-driven cars: getting to a location on time, respecting speed limits, or driving as safely as possible. Self-driving cars, like humans, are constantly improving their driving abilities through experience.  Yes. Sometimes, a self-driving car will perform better on a highway with little traffic.  No. Sometimes, if the highways are dangerous  owing to weather conditions and heavy traffic  a self-driving car should take a safer road defined by slow speed and little to no traffic. This way, if difficulties occur, the self-driving car can slow down and even stop more easily than on a highway.  2. Self-driving cars will never really replace human drivers.  Yes  No   Nobody can answer that question. As self-driving cars build their abilities and experience, they might well end up driving better than humans.  In very unpredictable situations, humans can go off the road to avoid another car and back off a bit, for example. It will take more work to get a self-driving car to do that.  One thing is certain, though. If a human is driving all night and falls asleep, the self- driving car will detect the head slumping movement, take over, and save lives. The self-driving car can also save lives if the human has a medical problem while driving.   3. Will a self-driving fire truck with robots be able to put out a fire one day?  Yes  No   Yes. Combining self-driving fire trucks with robots will certainly save many lives when a fire department faces difficult fires to extinguish. Those saved lives include firemen who risk their own lives. It might help firemen focus on helping people while the robots do the tougher jobs. This robot-human team will no doubt save thousands of lives in the future.  4. Do major cities need to invest in self-driving cars or avoid them?  Invest  Avoid   Invest. With slow but safe self-driving cars, commuters could share public, free or very cheap, electric self-driving cars instead of having to drive. It would be like having a personal chauffeur.  [ 444 ]   Answers to the Questions  5. Would you trust a self-driving bus to take children to school and back?  Yes  No   No. Not in the present state of self-driving cars.   Yes, when self-driving cars, buses, and trucks prove that they can outperform humans. Self-driving vehicles will not make mistakes humans do: using smartphones while driving, talking to passengers without looking at the road, and much more.  6. Would you be able to sleep in a self-driving car on a highway?  Yes  No   Not in the present state of self-driving vehicle technology.  Yes, when reliability replaces doubts.  7. Would you like to develop a self-driving program for a project for a city?  Yes  No   That one is for you to think about! You can also apply the technology to warehouses for AGVs by contacting the companies or AGV manufacturers directly.  Chapter 14  cid:97  Optimizing Blockchains with AI  1. Cryptocurrency is the only use of blockchains today.  Yes  No   No. IBM HyperLedger, for example, uses blockchains to organize secure transactions in a supply chain environment.  2. Mining blockchains can be lucrative.  Yes  No   Yes. But it is a risk, like any other mining operation. Some companies have huge resources to mine cryptocurrency, meaning that they can beat smaller competitors to creating a block.  3. Using blockchains for companies cannot be applied to sales.  Yes  No   No. False. Blockchain cloud platforms provide smart contracts and a secure way of managing transactions during a sales process.  4. Smart contracts for blockchains are more accessible to write than standard offline contracts.  Yes  No   Yes. If they are standard contracts, this speeds the transaction up.  No. If the transaction is complex and requires customization, a lawyer will have to write the contract, which can then only be used on a blockchain cloud platform.  [ 445 ]   Answers to the Questions  5. Once a block is in a blockchain network, everyone in the network can read the content.  Yes  No   Yes if no privacy rule has been enforced.  No. IBM Hyperledger, for example, provides privacy functions.  6. A block in a blockchain guarantees that absolutely no fraud is possible.  Yes  No   Yes. A block in a blockchain can never be changed again, avoiding fraud. Nobody can tamper with the data.  No. If the transaction is illegal in the first place, then the block will be fraudulent as well.   7. There is only one way of applying Bayes' theorem.  Yes  No   No. There are many variations of Bayes Theorem. Using Naive Bayes, for example, avoids the conditional probability constraint. But another approach could use conditional probability.   8. Training a Naive Bayes dataset requires a standard function.  Yes  No   No.  Gaussian functions, for example, can be used to calculate Naive Bayes algorithms, among others.  9. Machine learning algorithms will not change the intrinsic nature of the corporate business.  Yes  No   No. False. Machine learning will disrupt every area of businesses as algorithms spread through the company, optimizing processes.  Chapter 15  cid:97  Cognitive NLP Chatbots  1. Can a chatbot communicate like a human?  Yes  No   No. Communicating like a human means being human: having a body with body language, sensations, odors, fear hormones, and much more.  Yes. In certain situations, if a quantum mind   cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:25 , Quantum Computers That Think  is built, a chatbot will produce near-human conversations.  [ 446 ]   Answers to the Questions  2. Are chatbots necessarily artificial intelligence programs?  Yes  No   No. Many call centers use the "press 1, press 2...press n" method, which requires careful organization but no artificial intelligence.   3. Chatbots only need words to communicate.  Yes  No   Yes. Simple chatbots can communicate with words in a controlled situation.  No. When polysemy  several meanings for a same word or situation  is involved, pictograms and more will add more efficient dimensions.   4. Do humans only chat with words?  Yes  No   No. In fact, humans express with the tone of their voice, body language, or music, for example.  5. Humans only think in words and numbers.  Yes  No   No. Certainly not. Humans think in images, sounds, odors, and feelings.  6. To build a cognitive chatbot, mental images are necessary.  Yes  No   No. In limited "press 1 or press 2 " situations, chatbots can perform well with limited cognitive capacities.  Yes. To engage in a real conversation with a human, mental images are the key to providing an empathetic exchange.  7. For a chatbot to function, a dialog flow needs to be planned.  Yes  No   Yes. It will provide better results in a business environment.  No. If you want the chatbot to talk freely, you need to free it a bit. This still requires planning of the dialog but it is more flexible.  8. A chatbot possesses general artificial intelligence, so no prior development is required.  Yes  No   No. This is presently impossible. Only narrow  specific to one or a few fields  artificial intelligence exists in real life, contrary to science fiction movies and media hype.  [ 447 ]   Answers to the Questions  9. A chatbot translates fine without any function other than a translation API.  Yes  No   No. See  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:26 , Revolutions Designed for Some Corporations and Disruptive Innovations for Small to Large Companies.  10. Chatbots can already chat like humans in most cases.  Yes  No   No.  cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:26 , Revolutions Designed for Some Corporations and Disruptive Innovations for Small to Large Companies, shows that interpreting a language will take quite some more challenging work and contributions.  Chapter 16  cid:97  Improve the Emotional Intelligence Deficiencies of Chatbots 1. Restricted Boltzmann Machines are based on directed graphs.  Yes  No   No. RBM graphs are undirected, unsupervised, and memoryless, and the decision making is based on random calculations.  2. The hidden units of an RBM are generally connected to each other.  Yes  No   No. The hidden units of an RBM are not generally connected to each other.  3. Random sampling is not used in an RBM.  Yes  No   No. False. Gibbs random sampling is frequently applied to RBMs.  4. Is there a method to prevent gradients from vanishing in an RNN?  Yes  No   Yes. When the gradient gets "stuck" around 0, for example, a ReLU function can solve this problem. It will force negative values to become 0  or a fixed value in a leaky ReLU , and the positive values will not change.  5. LSTM cells never forget.  Yes  No   No. False. LSTM cells "forget" by skipping connections, adding connections from the past to the present, and other techniques.  6. Word2vector transforms words into indexes along with their labels.  Yes  No   Yes. Word2vector transforms words into numbers and also keeps track of their labels.   [ 448 ]   Answers to the Questions  7. Principal Component Analysis  PCA  transforms data into higher dimensions.  Yes  No   Yes. The whole point of PCA is to transform data into higher dimensions to find the principal component  highest eigenvalue of a covariance matrix , then the second highest, and down to the lowest values.  8. In a covariance matrix, the eigenvector shows the direction of the vector representing that matrix, and the eigenvalue shows the size of that vector.  Yes  No   Yes. Eigenvalues indicate how important a feature is, and eigenvectors provide a direction.  9. It is impossible to represent a human mind in a machine.  Yes  No   No. It is possible.   cid:36  cid:73  cid:66  cid:81  cid:85  cid:70  cid:83  cid:2  cid:19  cid:25 , Quantum Computers That Think, shows how to build a machine mind. It takes quite some work to include sensors, but the technology is there.  10. A machine cannot learn concepts, which is why classical applied mathematics is enough to make efficient artificial intelligence programs for every field.  Yes  No   No. Never believe that. Progress is being made and will never stop until mind- machines become mainstream.   Chapter 17  cid:97  Quantum Computers That Think 1. Beyond the hype, no quantum computer exists.  Yes  No   No. False. You can already run a quantum computer on IBM Q's cloud platform.   cid:73  cid:85  cid:85  cid:81  cid:84  cid:28  cid:17  cid:17  cid:88  cid:88  cid:88  cid:16  cid:83  cid:70  cid:84  cid:70  cid:66  cid:83  cid:68  cid:73  cid:16  cid:74  cid:67  cid:78  cid:16  cid:68  cid:80  cid:78  cid:17  cid:74  cid:67  cid:78  cid:15  cid:82  cid:17   The following screenshot is the result of a real IBM quantum computer calculation I ran on a quantum score explained in the chapter:  [ 449 ]   Answers to the Questions  2. A quantum computer can store data.  Yes  No   No. Instability prevents any form of storage at this point.  [ 450 ]   Answers to the Questions  3. The effect of quantum gates on qubits can be viewed with a Bloch Sphere.  Yes  No   Yes. A Bloch sphere will display the state of a qubit.  4. A mind that thinks with past experiences, images, words, and other bits of every day like stored in memory will find deeper solutions to problems that mathematics alone cannot solve.  Yes  No   No. False. Many researchers believe that mathematics alone can solve all human problems.  Yes. True. Mathematics alone cannot replace deep thinking. Even if computers have incredible power and can beat human players at chess, for example, they still cannot adapt to new situations without going through a design and training process. Concepts need to be added and experienced  memory as well .  I bet that machine mind concepts will become progressively more mainstream to solve deep thinking problems.  5. A quantum computer will solve medical research problems that cannot be solved today.  Yes  No   Yes. There is no doubt about that. The sheer computing power of a quantum computer can provide exponential DNA sequencing programs for epigenetic research.  6. A quantum computer can solve mathematical problems exponentially faster than classical computers.  Yes  No   Yes. Classical computers function at 2 x n  number of bits  and quantum computers run at 2n  n being the number of qubits !  7. Classical computers and smartphone processors will soon disappear and smartphone processors also.  Yes  No   No. Quantum computers require such a large amount of space and physical stability that this will not happen in the near future. Furthermore, classical computers and smartphones can store data. Quantum computers cannot.  [ 451 ]   Answers to the Questions  8. A quantum score cannot be written in source code format but only with a visual interface.  Yes  No   No. False. IBM, for example, can swap the quantum from score to QASM interface or display both, as shown here:  9. Quantum simulators can run as fast as quantum computers.  Yes  No   Certainly not! A simulator just shows how a quantum score would behave on a real quantum computer. Although the simulator can help build the score, a quantum computer will run exponentially faster than the simulator.  10. Quantum computers produce intermediate results while they are running calculations.  Yes  No   No. This is not possible. The qubits are too unstable. Observing them makes the system collapse. However, simulators such as Quirk come in handy. Since they are not real, intermediate results can be displayed to design a quantum score.
