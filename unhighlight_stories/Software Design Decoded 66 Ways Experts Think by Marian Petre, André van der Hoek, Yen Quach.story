The typical  answer—experience and innate ability—is less than  satisfying. While it carries elements of truth, it offers  little from which we can learn and generalize. Experts  clearly do not just approach their work randomly.   Quite the contrary, they have specific habits, learned  practices, and observed principles that they employ  deliberately during their design work.  This book offers a look at those habits, practices,   and principles, one rooted in many years of studying  professional software designers and their ways of  working. It offers 66 “things that expert software   10612.indb   7  8 26 16   10:29 AM   designers do,” each of which can be traced back to  academic literature that documents expert behavior and  each of which has been confirmed to us time and again  by those working in the field.  Some may be familiar, others not. Some are easily put  in practice, others not. Some have immediate impact,  others not. A constant, however, is that expert software  designers are keenly aware of all of these practices and  draw on them when the situation calls for it.  Today, software is no longer limited by technology, but  rather by imagination. Yet the software that turns the  imagined into reality can be complex, and the context   10612.indb   8  8 26 16   10:29 AM   in which this transformation must happen can be even  more complex. This places extraordinary demands on  software designers, demands that can be met only if we  collectively “step up” to achieve sustained excellence   in design.  We hope this book plays its part.  10612.indb   9  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   10  8 26 16   10:29 AM   ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This book would not have been possible without the  many software designers we have been able to study,  observe, interview, and simply talk to over the years.

Experts strongly prefer simpler solutions  over more complex ones, for they know that such  solutions are easier to understand and change in the  future. Simplicity is so important to them that they  often continue to search for simpler solutions even after  they have a solution in hand.  10612.indb   19  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   20  8 26 16   10:29 AM   2   EXPERTS SOLVE    SIMPLER PROBLEMS FIRST Experts do not try to think about everything at once.  When faced with a complex problem, experts often  solve a simpler problem first, one that addresses the  same core issue in a more straightforward form. In  doing so, they can generate candidate solutions that  are incomplete, but provide insight for solving the more  complex problem that they actually have to solve.  10612.indb   21  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   22  8 26 16   10:29 AM   3   EXPERTS DIVIDE    AND CONQUER Experts know when and how to break down a complex  problem into smaller problems that can be solved  independently. In addressing the parts, however, they  do not forget about the whole: they reflect on the  relationships between parts. When what emerges  in solving one part affects other parts, they make  adjustments. Indeed, they sometimes repartition the  whole problem and solution as a result.  10612.indb   23  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   24  8 26 16   10:29 AM   4   EXPERTS  DO NOT   OVERGENERALIZE General solutions are preferred over less general  solutions, both for the design as a whole and for its   constituent parts. Experts, however, avoid  overgeneralizing, which constitutes wasted effort and   leads to solutions that are more complex than  necessary. The balance is important. Experts use what  they know about the practical constraints of the   design context to decide whether to generalize for reuse  or to optimize for the immediate situation.  10612.indb   25  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   26  8 26 16   10:29 AM   5   EXPERTS DESIGN    ELEGANT ABSTRACTIONS While all developers create abstractions, experts  design them. A good abstraction makes evident what  is important, both in what it does and how it does it.  Through a single lens, it communicates the problem   it solves and the machinery of its solution.   Experts are not satisfied with just any abstraction, they  deliberately seek elegant abstractions through which  complex structures can be introduced, understood, and  referred to efficiently.  10612.indb   27  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   28  8 26 16   10:29 AM   6   EXPERTS USE    METAPHOR Experts frequently use metaphor to discuss parts of  a design and how it works. By invoking metaphor, a  more vivid and immediately available picture is evoked  of some aspects of the software, which particularly  benefits collaborative design work in quickly and  succinctly communicating ideas and assumptions.  10612.indb   29  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   30  8 26 16   10:29 AM   EXPERTS    COLLABORATE  10612.indb   31  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   32  8 26 16   10:29 AM   7  EXPERTS PREFER    WORKING WITH OTHERS To experts, the image of the designer as a lone genius  who has flashes of brilliance is a fallacy. Experts know  that stimulation through working with others is key to  their own design performance. Moments of surprising  or deep insight do happen, but experts know that  those moments are more likely in a rich, collaborative  environment.  10612.indb   33  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   34  8 26 16   10:29 AM   8   EXPERTS    REACH OUT Experts deliberately involve others outside of their   team when they have a purpose for doing so, often to  obtain specialized technical or domain knowledge.   Experts do not wait to contact others when they need  them; they know that “sooner is better.”  10612.indb   35  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   36  8 26 16   10:29 AM   9   EXPERTS CHECK    WITH OTHERS CONTINUALLY Experts know to check with collaborators regularly  to coordinate mutual efforts, goals, ideas, and  assumptions. They know that individual work may  diverge within a collaboration, and that spotting  divergence is crucial, both to identifying errors and  seizing opportunities. Frequent ad hoc communication   rather than formal meetings  is a feature of high- performing teams.  10612.indb   37  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   38  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10   EXPERTS INVOLVE    THE USER Experts are acutely aware of users. They deliberately  involve users in the design process, studying them,  talking to them, engaging them in testing intermediate  designs, and even asking them to take an active role in  the design team.  Yet experts do not take everything users say at face  value. They realize the potential limitations, as users’  thinking is often colored by current experiences.   Experts look beyond what users ask for, to what users  actually need.  10612.indb   39  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   40  8 26 16   10:29 AM   11   EXPERTS SOCIALLY    EMBED AND REINFORCE    GOOD PRACTICE Experts know that the interplay between designers  plays a crucial part both in nurturing creativity and  in promoting quality and rigor. They consciously  embed and reinforce good practice in their team.  They use knowledge of the group, of both individual  and combined strengths and limitations, to structure  activities, provide systematic checks, and share  knowledge. This collective safety net liberates individuals  to extend themselves.  Experts especially take care over the induction of new  members into local culture and practice, while eliciting  fresh perspectives from them.  10612.indb   41  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   42  8 26 16   10:29 AM   12   EXPERTS AGREE    TO DISAGREE For the benefit of the design project, experts often  agree to disagree. They know that divergence of  opinions can drive innovation and excellence in design.   They also know that many decisions made early  are adjusted, retracted, or refined later on, and so  prolonged haggling tends to be counterproductive if  there is more design to do. Instead, experts accept  temporary disagreement and proceed in designing   other aspects of the project. More information resulting  from further design activity will help them resolve   their disagreement.  10612.indb   43  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   44  8 26 16   10:29 AM   EXPERTS    BORROW  10612.indb   45  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   46  8 26 16   10:29 AM   13   EXPERTS PREFER SOLUTIONS   THAT THEY KNOW WORK Experts have no desire to “re-invent the wheel.” If they  have a solution that works, or know of one elsewhere,  they will adopt that solution and move on to other parts  of the design task. Of course, they know to re-assess  the existing solution within the context of the current  project, to make sure that it actually fits. As long as   it does, and as long as it is legally and ethically allowed,  they choose to borrow rather than build, reuse rather  than re-implement, and copy rather than draft.  10612.indb   47  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   48  8 26 16   10:29 AM   14   EXPERTS    LOOK AROUND In the same way that architects walk cities to examine  and take inspiration from existing buildings, software  experts examine the designs of other software to   “see how they did it.” They frequently do so in response  to a particular challenge they face, but they often  also spend time looking around just to add to their  repertoire of possible design solutions to draw upon   in the future.  10612.indb   49  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   50  8 26 16   10:29 AM   15   EXPERTS TAKE INSPIRATION   FROM WHEREVER THEY CAN Experts live with their heads up and their eyes open.  They are aware of their surroundings and “try on” any  ideas they spot. They take inspiration from other people,  from other areas  photography, astronomy, literature,  model railways , and from their wider environment    a whiteboard drawing, a blog post, a toy, a game . They  continually collect ideas that might be useful.  10612.indb   51  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   52  8 26 16   10:29 AM   16   EXPERTS USE    ANALOGY In dealing with intractable problems, experts sometimes  turn to analogy, levering likeness and unlikeness to  other situations to shift their thinking. They carefully  examine where the analogy holds and where it does  not, and especially use where it breaks down to drive  their understanding of the design problem at hand.  10612.indb   53  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   54  8 26 16   10:29 AM   17   EXPERTS USE DESIGN    METHODS  SELECTIVELY  Experts do not re-invent how to go about design. While  they know that design is a creative process that involves  impromptu activities, they also use structured design  methods to advance their project when appropriate.  They know of and apply a host of methods  world  modeling, tradeoff analysis, refactoring, storyboarding,  test-driven development, cognitive walkthrough .  However, they also know the limitations of such  methods and apply them only if they believe their  project will benefit. Experts balance systematic practice  with freedom of invention.  10612.indb   55  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   56  8 26 16   10:29 AM   18   EXPERTS    NETWORK Experts are very aware that they do not know  everything—far from it. They compensate by building  a network of people who know things, have special  expertise and domain knowledge, or know how to think  and question. They know to whom to turn when they  need something.  10612.indb   57  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   58  8 26 16   10:29 AM   EXPERTS   BREAK    THE RULES  10612.indb   59  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   60  8 26 16   10:29 AM   19   EXPERTS RELAX   CONSTRAINTS Experts do not take much for granted, and for tough  problems they will reconsider just about anything,  including hard constraints. They relax these constraints  in order to explore a broader range of possibilities,  sometimes relaxing different constraints successively so   as to challenge their understanding and promote insight.  Experts particularly break constraints early, when  creativity and exploration are needed. Of course, as  they progress and begin to form a more comprehensive  solution, they want clarity and completeness, and  re-introduce the genuine constraints they previously  ignored.  10612.indb   61  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   62  8 26 16   10:29 AM   20   EXPERTS RESHAPE    THE PROBLEM SPACE Experts often step back from the stated problem and  consider the problem space more broadly, looking for  alternative ways of understanding “what the problem  is.” They may change direction by reconceiving the  problem space, or by addressing a different problem in  the same space. They intentionally choose somewhat  different goals from the original design problem, as this  leads to insights either into where the real problem lies,  or into how to overcome key obstacles.  10612.indb   63  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   64  8 26 16   10:29 AM   21   EXPERTS USE NOTATIONS    AS LENSES, RATHER THAN   STRAIGHTJACKETS Experts understand the true value of notations: they  serve as lenses to examine a design problem or advance  a design solution from a particular perspective.   Experts are not married to any one notation and will use  whichever notation best suits the task at hand.  As any notation emphasizes some information at the  expense of other information, experts remember to  complement the leverage a notation gives them with  engaging with what is outside of it.  10612.indb   65  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   66  8 26 16   10:29 AM   22   EXPERTS DESIGN    THROUGHOUT THE    CREATION OF SOFTWARE Experts do not subscribe to the vision that design  is merely a phase during which requirements are  transformed into an architecture or implementation  design. Rather, experts know that requirements  are designed, that interactions are designed, that  architectures are designed, that code is designed, and— most important—that all these forms of software design  inter-relate and are often worked on in parallel. They  know it is therefore frequently important to break out of  a prescribed software development process and engage  in design activities where and when necessary.  10612.indb   67  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   68  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS DO NOT FEEL   OBLIGED TO USE THINGS    AS INTENDED Experts use what is useful to them and no more.  Because they understand what they need and why,  they adopt things on their own terms. They may apply  a methodology selectively, recombine process steps,  cross paradigms, alter model solutions, or use methods  in unexpected ways.  23  10612.indb   69  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   70  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS   SKETCH  10612.indb   71  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   72  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS EXTERNALIZE   THEIR THOUGHTS Experts sketch when they think. They sketch when  alone. They sketch in meetings with colleagues or  clients. They sketch when they have no apparent need  to sketch. They sketch on paper, on whiteboards, on  napkins, in the air. Experts know that sketching is a way  to interact with their own thoughts, an opportunity to  externalize, examine, and advance what they have in  their minds.  24  10612.indb   73  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   74  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS DRAW THE    PROBLEM AS MUCH AS    THEY DRAW THE SOLUTION Experts know that their understanding of the design  problem and their understanding of its solution  inevitably deepen and co-evolve as they design. Experts  therefore draw the problem as much as they draw  the solution: by moving back-and-forth, they not only  ensure that both stay in sync, but also explicitly use  advances in the understanding of one to drive advances  in the understanding of the other.  25  10612.indb   75  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   76  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS DRAW WHAT    THEY NEED AND NO MORE Experts are frugal in creating their sketches. Experts  draw what they need to support their thinking,  discussion, argument, communication, or other design  activity—but no more. A sketch consisting of a few  boxes, a few arrows, and a few annotations is not  uncommon, as is a diagram that is later uninterpretable  because of its sparseness. Providing detail when it is   not needed is a waste of effort and distracts from the  task at hand.  26  10612.indb   77  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   78  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS SHIFT BETWEEN   FORMAL AND INFORMAL Experts are not lazy. When the situation calls for it, they  employ much more formal diagrams than the sketches  they typically create. To model certain phenomena more  clearly—with more precision and completeness—they  may well work out a state machine in all of its detail,  edit pseudocode on a whiteboard, or meticulously  specify all of the entities, fields, keys, and relationships  in a database schema. Once done, however, they will  quickly return to sketching, employing a more informal  style that abandons much notational detail.  27  10612.indb   79  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   80  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS INVENT   NOTATIONS Experts choose a notation that suits the problem, even  if the notation does not exist. New notations arise  when, in the heat of design, shorthand symbols are  used that take on a meaning of their own. This meaning  typically persists for the duration of the design meeting,  but in some cases use of the symbols becomes more  pervasive in the design project.  28  10612.indb   81  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   82  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS    KEEP SKETCHES Experts prefer to keep their sketches rather than discard  them. Their desks are cluttered with paper sketches.  Their whiteboards are full of drawings. They may have  an archive full of old sketches. All for a reason: they  know they may need to revisit a sketch, whether   to consult it to re-invigorate their understanding or to  evolve it because some goal or constraint has changed.  29  10612.indb   83  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   84  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS    WORK WITH   UNCERTAINTY  10612.indb   85  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   86  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS KEEP    OPTIONS OPEN Although a natural inclination might be to solidify any  design decision that can be made as early as possible,  experts do the opposite: they prefer to keep their  options open. They know that any decision they make  now may need to be revised later if they wish to explore  an alternative direction. Therefore, if they do not   have to make a particular decision yet, they simply   will not make it.  30  10612.indb   87  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   88  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS MAKE    PROVISIONAL DECISIONS To further a design solution, experts often make  decisions provisionally. They keep track of which  decisions are firm and which are provisional, as well as  the conditions under which the decisions are made.   This way, they acknowledge explicitly where their  design is still tentative and where it is more definite.  31  10612.indb   89  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   90  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS SEE ERROR    AS OPPORTUNITY Design regularly involves error: things that “go amiss,”  misunderstandings, obstacles, wrong turns, emergent  issues. Rather than fearing error, experts embrace error  as opportunity. They accept it as an inherent part of  design and take time to explore both the failure and  the context around it. Understanding what happened  often reveals insights about the problem—or about  the solution—such as assumptions, misconceptions,  misalignments, and emergent properties.  32  10612.indb   91  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   92  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS KNOW    HOW THINGS WORK Experts have a huge, accessible store of knowledge.  They know how things work in general. They know   how specific things work. They know how the current  design works. When something is uncertain, experts  bring that knowledge to bear, extending from the  known to the unknown.  33  10612.indb   93  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   94  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS MAKE    TRADEOFFS No design problem can be solved perfectly. Experts  realize that designing is making tradeoffs, with each  decision they make favoring some aspects of the design  solution over others. Experts inform their decisions  by collecting as much information as possible and  considering how each potential decision trades off  among their design goals.  34  10612.indb   95  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   96  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS PRIORITIZE   AMONG STAKEHOLDERS The history of software is littered with examples in  which the wrong stakeholders were prioritized  usually  managers over end users . Experts cut through issues of  positions of power and human preference, opinion,   and bias to identify the real stakeholders—the people  who in the end determine whether or not the system  will be adopted successfully. By focusing on them,  experts can set the right design priorities for the project.  35  10612.indb   97  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   98  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS ADJUST    TO THE DEGREE OF    UNCERTAINTY PRESENT Different design problems incur different amounts of  uncertainty. Experts know which type of problem they  are dealing with and adjust their practices accordingly.  Routine problems have less uncertainty and are handled  in a standard, informed manner, with many decisions  made early. Adaptive and original problems involve  more uncertainty and require exploration and invention.  This entails maintaining more alternatives, deferring  more decisions and making provisional decisions, and  backtracking as necessary.  36  10612.indb   99  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   100  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS    ARE NOT   AFRAID  10612.indb   101  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   102  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS FOCUS    ON THE ESSENCE Every design problem has an essence, a core set of  considerations that must be understood and “nailed”  in the design solution for it to solve the problem  successfully. This essence can be disruptive: changes in  the core drastically alter the peripheral decisions that  need to be made. Experts focus their efforts on the  essence first, and delay expending effort designing on  the periphery.  37  10612.indb   103  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   104  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS ADDRESS    KNOWLEDGE DEFICIENCIES Experts make every effort to find out and fill in what they  do not know. In fact, experts explicitly look for gaps in  their understanding of a design problem and its possible  solutions, and they try to address those deficiencies as  early as they can. They know that “not knowing” is worse  than knowing that something is problematic.  A particular form of knowledge deficiency is  assumptions. Experts know that making assumptions  is an integral part of design practice, but make every  effort to verify whether or not their assumptions hold.  38  10612.indb   105  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   106  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS GO    AS DEEP AS NEEDED Experts are not afraid to get their hands dirty in nitty- gritty details. If code must be written to understand  whether a particular algorithm is sufficiently  performant, they write code. If model checking is  needed to guarantee a certain property in their design,  they build and check the model.  Experts know that any abstraction they make is  eventually put to the test by its transition to code, which  is why they often engage with implementation—even  during conceptual design. Aligning abstraction and  implementation enforces discipline and accuracy.  39  10612.indb   107  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   108  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS TRY    THE OPPOSITE Experts take drastic measures when needed. When they  are stuck, they might try the opposite. This may not lead  to a satisfactory solution, but it almost certainly leads  to new insights that help them free their minds, identify  new possibilities, and decide on how to press forward.  40  10612.indb   109  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   110  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS DO    SOMETHING  ELSE  Most design projects bog down at some point, when  every suggestion seems to lead to further problems.  Rather than continuing to “bang their heads” against  the same problem, experts switch their focus to another  part of the design. It often does not matter what they  choose to work on, as long as they change focus for a  while. Doing so is likely to reveal considerations that  help them overcome the obstacle.  41  10612.indb   111  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   112  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS KNOW    WHEN TO STOP Experts are sensitive to when the incremental benefits  of revisiting the same issue diminish. They have   a strong internal gauge as to when it is time to stop   and move on.  42  10612.indb   113  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   114  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS BUILD    THEIR OWN TOOLS Experts go to great lengths to surround themselves with  the right tools for the job. This includes not only finding,  evaluating, and appropriating external tools, but also  creating special-purpose tools  intermediate languages,  testing tools, visualizations  that fit the design situation.  43  10612.indb   115  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   116  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS    ITERATE  10612.indb   117  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   118  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS REPEAT    ACTIVITIES Experts ask the same questions multiple times, of  different people, but also of the same people.   Experts test their designs, not once, but multiple  times. Experts draw a diagram, then draw it again, and  perhaps again and again. Experts repeat these activities  because they know that, each time they do so, they  must re-engage with a fresh mindset and re-explain to  themselves or others. Variations in how they engage,  think, draw, and communicate, as well as variations   in what they choose to focus on, uncover new issues  and opportunities.  44  10612.indb   119  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   120  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS GENERATE   ALTERNATIVES Experts explicitly seek, develop, and evaluate  alternatives throughout design. They do this at all  levels. By probing these alternatives, even just in their  minds, they maintain as much flexibility in the design  solution as possible. Alternatives make explicit where  and how the design might be able to “give” in the face  of future decisions.  45  10612.indb   121  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   122  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS EXPLORE    DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES Experts examine a design problem, and its possible  solutions, from different perspectives. They examine   the problem from both a human and a technical  perspective. They assess architectures for their structural  quality, implementability, and deployability. They look  at both the usability and the accessibility of different  interface mock-ups. Because they know that focusing  narrowly on a single perspective is guaranteed to   miss important considerations, they explicitly iterate  over multiple perspectives.  46  10612.indb   123  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   124  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS MOVE AMONG    LEVELS OF ABSTRACTION Experts design their solutions at multiple levels of  abstraction, concurrently. They know that focusing only  on high-level models is likely to omit important detail  and that working only on low-level code is likely to lead  to inelegant solutions. In exploring a design solution,  they deliberately move up and down among levels   of abstraction, and use resonances among them to  spark insights and identify problems.  47  10612.indb   125  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   126  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS ROTATE    AMONG SUBJECT PAIRS Even in the throes of working on detailed issues  concerning a design, experts iterate through issues in  combination. They know that it is futile to consider a  single issue in isolation for a long period of time. Rather,  they juxtapose them: experts choose to focus on two   occasionally three  separate issues, consider them  together, make some progress, and move on to the  next pair of issues fairly quickly. In cycling through and  iterating over pairs of issues, they ensure that different  aspects of the design stay in sync with one another as  they formulate the overall solution.  48  10612.indb   127  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   128  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS CHANGE    NOTATION DELIBERATELY Experts ask themselves what would happen if they  remodeled what they have in a different notation, using  somewhat different modeling concepts or somewhat  different semantics. Differences in expression can prompt  them to consider additional issues.  49  10612.indb   129  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   130  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS    PAUSE Experts prefer to build discontinuity into the design   process: by taking a break, they are more likely to  uncover fresh issues the next time.  50  10612.indb   131  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   132  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS    TEST  10612.indb   133  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   134  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS ARE    SKEPTICAL Where others are content, experts remain skeptical.  They are skeptical that they explored the necessary  breadth and depth of possible solutions. They are  skeptical that the current leading solution is good, or  even just good enough. They are skeptical of others’,   and their own, ideas. That is why they test their designs.  Testing can provide instructive evidence: whether the  design meets its objectives, whether there are emergent  issues, or whether assumptions are justified.  51  10612.indb   135  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   136  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS SIMULATE   CONTINUALLY Experts imagine how a design will work—simulating  aspects of the envisioned software and how the  different parts of the design support a variety of  scenarios. When working with others, experts regularly  walk through a design by verbalizing its operation   step-by-step. When alone, they simulate mentally,  exercising the design repeatedly over time.  52  10612.indb   137  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   138  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS DRAW EXAMPLES    ALONGSIDE    THEIR DIAGRAMS On their own, design diagrams remain passive  abstractions. This is why experts draw examples  alongside the diagrams when they simulate a design.  Externalizing their thoughts, juxtaposing the simulation  with their design, and envisioning the execution in  context, forces them to interpret what they drew and   to test their design more thoroughly in the process.  53  10612.indb   139  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   140  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS TEST    ACROSS REPRESENTATIONS Different aspects of a design solution are often  represented in different diagrams—commonly in  different notations altogether. Rather than testing each  of these in isolation, experts know to juxtapose them  in order to examine their dependencies, constraints,  interactions, and other alignments.  54  10612.indb   141  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   142  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS PROTOTYPE   CONCEPTS Experts know that people struggle to engage with  abstractions and therefore frequently turn to prototypes  to elicit feedback. Prototypes, whether on paper or  as more realistic mock-ups, show concretely how the  proposed design will behave. They allow stakeholders  to engage with and respond to the design concepts,  potentially providing important contextual information.  55  10612.indb   143  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   144  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS    PLAY THE FOOL Experts pretend to be ignorant, purposely setting aside  what they know about the design in order to expose  assumptions and flaws. Similarly, they place themselves  in the shoes of a novice user, or a co-worker   unfamiliar with the design, and imagine the questions  they would ask.  56  10612.indb   145  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   146  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS ARE ALERT TO    EVIDENCE THAT CHALLENGES   THEIR THEORY Experts remain alert to anything that might challenge  what they believe about their design. They are open   to information that is unexpected, and are particularly   sensitive to any indication that their design might be  wrong. An offhand comment from a future user that  does not align with the current design might well prompt  a significant shift in design scope.  To experts, no issue is too small to investigate, for they  know that small issues can be indicative of much larger  problems lurking beneath the surface.  57  10612.indb   147  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   148  8 26 16   10:29 AM   EXPERTS    REFLECT  10612.indb   149  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   150  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS CURTAIL   DIGRESSIONS It is not uncommon for designers to realize suddenly  that they have been discussing an at-best marginal issue  for half a meeting. Experts know that, in the midst of  design, it is easy to lose sight of what is happening, and  they make it a practice to check regularly where they  are and where they are going. They use this information  to abandon unproductive work, and focus effort where  it needs to be focused.  58  10612.indb   151  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   152  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS RETAIN    THEIR ORIENTATION After many meetings, changes, and enhancements,  losing track of how the design at hand actually works  is not unusual. Experts know the importance of  understanding fully the essential underlying concepts of  a design, and they make every effort to ensure that they  remember the decisions that have already been made,  the ones that still need to be made, and why this is so.  59  10612.indb   153  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   154  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS THINK    ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE    NOT DESIGNING While it is natural to focus on what a design must  accomplish, experts also spend time thinking about  what a design is not intended to do. In articulating   and considering boundaries, they discover where they  are over- and under-designing.  60  10612.indb   155  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   156  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS RE-ASSESS    THE LANDSCAPE Experts periodically step back, not just to examine  progress, but also to reflect on the project as a whole.  They question whether they are still solving the right  problem. Have client goals changed? User perceptions?  Technology? Deployment context? Market? Experts ask  these questions with regularity, to ensure the software  they design is fit for purpose.  61  10612.indb   157  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   158  8 26 16   10:29 AM   EXPERTS INVEST NOW    TO SAVE EFFORT LATER In reflecting on an ongoing design project, experts   also anticipate what issues might emerge later.   They foreshadow alternative futures, and perform   cost-benefit analyses to determine whether   investments now—in methods, tools, resources, design  alternatives—could save effort later.  62  10612.indb   159  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   160  8 26 16   10:29 AM   EXPERTS   KEEP GOING  10612.indb   161  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   162  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS DESIGN    ALL THE TIME Experts design at their desk, when taking a walk, on  their way to work or back home, in the shower, in  the gym, and anywhere else—including in design  meetings and conversations. They mull over a design  whenever and wherever they can—through habit or  preoccupation—as they know that inspiration can strike  at any moment.  63  10612.indb   163  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   164  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS KNOW    DESIGN IS NOT DONE    UNTIL THE CODE IS    DELIVERED AND RUNNING The success of a design is determined largely by the  experiences of the users. Experts know that any design  decision can drastically influence perceptions. They  do not consider their designs done until the code is  delivered and running. That is when the users finally  experience the software.  64  10612.indb   165  8 26 16   10:29 AM   10612.indb   166  8 26 16   10:29 AM    EXPERTS    KEEP LEARNING Experts do not take their expertise for granted.
