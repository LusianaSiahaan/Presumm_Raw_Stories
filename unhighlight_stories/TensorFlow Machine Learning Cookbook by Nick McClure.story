TensorFlow's popularity is due to the  approach of creating computational graphs, automatic differentiation, and customizability.  Because of these features, TensorFlow is a very powerful and adaptable tool that can be used  to solve many different machine learning problems.  This book addresses many machine learning algorithms, applies them to real situations and  data, and shows how to interpret the results.  What this book covers Chapter 1, Getting Started with TensorFlow, covers the main objects and concepts in  TensorFlow. We introduce tensors, variables, and placeholders.  We also show how to work  with matrices and various mathematical operations in TensorFlow. At the end of the chapter  we show how to access the data sources used in the rest of the book.  Chapter 2, The TensorFlow Way, establishes how to connect all the algorithm components  from Chapter 1 into a computational graph in multiple ways to create a simple classifier.   Along the way, we cover computational graphs, loss functions, back propagation, and   training with data.  Chapter 3, Linear Regression, focuses on using TensorFlow for exploring various linear  regression techniques, such as Deming, lasso, ridge, elastic net, and logistic regression. We  show how to implement each in a TensorFlow computational graph.  Chapter 4, Support Vector Machines, introduces support vector machines  SVMs  and shows  how to use TensorFlow to implement linear SVMs, non-linear SVMs, and multi-class SVMs.  Chapter 5, Nearest Neighbor Methods, shows how to implement nearest neighbor techniques  using numerical metrics, text metrics, and scaled distance functions. We use nearest neighbor  techniques to perform record matching among addresses and to classify hand-written digits  from the MNIST database.  v   Chapter 6, Neural Networks, covers how to implement neural networks in TensorFlow, starting  with the operational gates and activation function concepts. We then show a shallow neural  network and show how to build up various different types of layers. We end the chapter by  teaching TensorFlow to play tic-tac-toe via a neural network method.  Chapter 7, Natural Language Processing, illustrates various text processing techniques with  TensorFlow.  We show how to implement the bag-of-words technique and TF-IDF for text. We  then introduce neural network text representations with CBOW and skip-gram and use these  techniques for Word2Vec and Doc2Vec for making real-world predictions.  Chapter 8, Convolutional Neural Networks, expands our knowledge of neural networks by  illustrating how to use neural networks on images with convolutional neural networks  CNNs .   We show how to build a simple CNN for MNIST digit recognition and extend it to color images  in the CIFAR-10 task.  We also illustrate how to extend prior trained image recognition models  for custom tasks.  We end the chapter by explaining and showing the stylenet neural style and  deep-dream algorithms in TensorFlow.  Chapter 9, Recurrent Neural Networks, explains how to implement recurrent neural networks   RNNs  in TensorFlow.  We show how to do text-spam prediction, and expand the RNN model  to do text generation based on Shakespeare.  We also train a sequence to sequence model  for German-English translation. We finish the chapter by showing the usage of Siamese RNN  networks for record matching on addresses.  Chapter 10, Taking TensorFlow to Production, gives tips and examples on moving TensorFlow  to a production environment and how to take advantage of multiple processing devices  for  example GPUs  and setting up TensorFlow distributed on multiple machines.  Chapter 11, More with TensorFlow, show the versatility of TensorFlow by illustrating how to do  k-means, genetic algorithms, and solve a system of ordinary differential equations  ODEs . We  also show the various uses of Tensorboard, and how to view computational graph metrics.

By the end of the chapter, you  should have knowledge of the following:   f How TensorFlow Works  f Declaring Variables and Tensors  f Using Placeholders and Variables  f Working with Matrices  f Declaring Operations  f Implementing Activation Functions  f Working with Data Sources  f Additional Resources  Introduction Google's TensorFlow engine has a unique way of solving problems. This unique way allows  us to solve machine learning problems very efficiently. Machine learning is used in almost  all areas of life and work, but some of the more famous areas are computer vision, speech  recognition, language translations, and healthcare. We will cover the basic steps to  understand how TensorFlow operates and eventually build up to production code techniques  later in the book. These fundamentals are important in order to understand the recipes in the  rest of this book.  1   How TensorFlow Works At first, computation in TensorFlow may seem needlessly complicated. But there is a reason for  it: because of how TensorFlow treats computation, developing more complicated algorithms is  relatively easy. This recipe will guide us through the pseudocode of a TensorFlow algorithm.  Getting ready Currently, TensorFlow is supported on Linux, Mac, and Windows. The code for this book has  been created and run on a Linux system, but should run on any other system as well. The code  for the book is available on GitHub at https:  github.com nfmcclure tensorflow_ cookbookTensorFlow. Throughout this book, we will only concern ourselves with the Python  library wrapper of TensorFlow, although most of the original core code for TensorFlow is written  in C++. This book will use Python 3.4+  https:  www.python.org  and TensorFlow 0.12   https:  www.tensorflow.org . TensorFlow has a 1.0.0 alpha version available on the  official GitHub site, and the code in this book has been reviewed to be compatible with that  version as well. While TensorFlow can run on the CPU, most algorithms run faster if processed  on the GPU, and it is supported on graphics cards with Nvidia Compute Capability v4.0+   v5.1 recommended . Popular GPUs for TensorFlow are Nvidia Tesla architectures and Pascal  architectures with at least 4 GB of video RAM. To run on a GPU, you will also need to download  and install the Nvidia Cuda Toolkit and also v 5.x +  https:  developer.nvidia.com  cuda-downloads . Some of the recipes will rely on a current installation of the Python  packages: Scipy, Numpy, and Scikit-Learn. These accompanying packages are also all included  in the Anaconda package  https:  www.continuum.io downloads .  How to do it… Here we will introduce the general flow of TensorFlow algorithms. Most recipes will follow   this outline:  1.   Import or generate datasets: All of our machine-learning algorithms will depend  on datasets. In this book, we will either generate data or use an outside source of  datasets. Sometimes it is better to rely on generated data because we will just want to  know the expected outcome. Most of the time, we will access public datasets for the  given recipe and the details on accessing these are given in section 8 of this chapter. 2.  Transform and normalize data: Normally, input datasets do not come in the shape  TensorFlow would expect so we need to transform TensorFlow them to the accepted  shape. The data is usually not in the correct dimension or type that our algorithms  expect. We will have to transform our data before we can use it. Most algorithms  also expect normalized data and we will do this here as well. TensorFlow has built-in  functions that can normalize the data for you as follows: data = tf.nn.batch_norm_with_global_normalization ...   2   3.  Partition datasets into train, test, and validation sets: We generally want to test our   algorithms on different sets that we have trained on. Also, many algorithms require  hyperparameter tuning, so we set aside a validation set for determining the best set  of hyperparameters.  4.  Set algorithm parameters  hyperparameters : Our algorithms usually have a set of   parameters that we hold constant throughout the procedure. For example, this can be  the number of iterations, the learning rate, or other fixed parameters of our choosing.  It is considered good form to initialize these together so the reader or user can easily  find them, as follows: learning_rate = 0.01 batch_size = 100 iterations = 1000  5.   Initialize variables and placeholders: TensorFlow depends on knowing what it can  and cannot modify. TensorFlow will modify adjust the variables and weight bias  during optimization to minimize a loss function. To accomplish this, we feed in data  through placeholders. We need to initialize both of these variables and placeholders  with size and type, so that TensorFlow knows what to expect. TensorFlow also needs  to know the type of data to expect: for most of this book, we will use float32.  TensorFlow also provides float64 and float16. Note that the more bytes used for  precision results in slower algorithms, but the less we use results in less precision.  See the following code: a_var = tf.constant 42  x_input = tf.placeholder tf.float32, [None, input_size]  y_input = tf.placeholder tf.float32, [None, num_classes]   6.  Define the model structure: After we have the data, and have initialized our   variables and placeholders, we have to define the model. This is done by building a  computational graph. TensorFlow chooses what operations and values must be the  variables and placeholders to arrive at our model outcomes. We talk more in depth  about computational graphs in the Operations in a Computational Graph TensorFlow  recipe in Chapter 2, The TensorFlow Way. Our model for this example will be a linear  model: y_pred = tf.add tf.mul x_input, weight_matrix , b_matrix   7.  Declare the loss functions: After defining the model, we must be able to evaluate  the output. This is where we declare the loss function. The loss function is very  important as it tells us how far off our predictions are from the actual values. The  different types of loss functions are explored in greater detail, in the Implementing  Back Propagation recipe in Chapter 2, The TensorFlow Way: loss = tf.reduce_mean tf.square y_actual – y_pred    3   8.   Initialize and train the model: Now that we have everything in place, we need to  create an instance of our graph, feed in the data through the placeholders, and let  TensorFlow change the variables to better predict our training data. Here is one way  to initialize the computational graph: with tf.Session graph=graph  as session:   ...   session.run ...    ...  Note that we can also initiate our graph with: session = tf.Session graph=graph  session.run …   9.  Evaluate the model: Once we have built and trained the model, we should evaluate   the model by looking at how well it does with new data through some specified  criteria. We evaluate on the train and test set and these evaluations will allow us to  see if the model is underfit or overfit. We will address these in later recipes.  10.  Tune hyperparameters: Most of the time, we will want to go back and change   some of the hyperparamters, based on the model performance. We then repeat  the previous steps with different hyperparameters and evaluate the model on the  validation set.  11.  Deploy predict new outcomes: It is also important to know how to make predictions   on new, unseen, data. We can do this with all of our models, once we have them  trained.  How it works… In TensorFlow, we have to set up the data, variables, placeholders, and model before we  tell the program to train and change the variables to improve the predictions. TensorFlow  accomplishes this through the computational graphs. These computational graphs are a  directed graphs with no recursion, which allows for computational parallelism. We create a  loss function for TensorFlow to minimize. TensorFlow accomplishes this by modifying the  variables in the computational graph. Tensorflow knows how to modify the variables because  it keeps track of the computations in the model and automatically computes the gradients  for every variable. Because of this, we can see how easy it can be to make changes and try  different data sources.   f A great place to start is to go through the official documentation of the Tensorflow   Python API section at https:  www.tensorflow.org api_docs python    f There are also tutorials available at: https:  www.tensorflow.org   See also  tutorials   4   Declaring Tensors Tensors are the primary data structure that TensorFlow uses to operate on the computational  graph. We can declare these tensors as variables and or feed them in as placeholders. First  we must know how to create tensors.  Getting ready When we create a tensor and declare it to be a variable, TensorFlow creates several graph  structures in our computation graph. It is also important to point out that just by creating  a tensor, TensorFlow is not adding anything to the computational graph. TensorFlow does  this only after creating available out of the tensor. See the next section on variables and  placeholders for more information.  How to do it… Here we will cover the main ways to create tensors in TensorFlow:  1.  Fixed tensors:              Create a zero filled tensor. Use the following: zero_tsr = tf.zeros [row_dim, col_dim]   Create a one filled tensor. Use the following: ones_tsr = tf.ones [row_dim, col_dim]   Create a constant filled tensor. Use the following: filled_tsr = tf.fill [row_dim, col_dim], 42   Create a tensor out of an existing constant. Use the following: constant_tsr = tf.constant [1,2,3]   Note that the tf.constant   function can be used to broadcast a  value into an array, mimicking the behavior of tf.fill   by writing  tf.constant 42, [row_dim, col_dim]   2.  Tensors of similar shape:    We can also initialize variables based on the shape of other tensors, as   follows: zeros_similar = tf.zeros_like constant_tsr  ones_similar = tf.ones_like constant_tsr   5   Note, that since these tensors depend on prior tensors, we must  initialize them in order. Attempting to initialize all the tensors all at  once willwould result in an error. See the section There's more… at  the end of the next chapter on variables and placeholders.  3.  Sequence tensors:                    TensorFlow allows us to specify tensors that contain defined intervals.  The following functions behave very similarly to the range   outputs and  numpy's linspace   outputs. See the following function: linear_tsr = tf.linspace start=0, stop=1, start=3   The resulting tensor is the sequence [0.0, 0.5, 1.0]. Note that this  function includes the specified stop value. See the following function: integer_seq_tsr = tf.range start=6, limit=15, delta=3   The result is the sequence [6, 9, 12]. Note that this function does not include  the limit value.  4.  Random tensors:  The following generated random numbers are from a uniform distribution: randunif_tsr = tf.random_uniform [row_dim, col_dim],  minval=0, maxval=1     Note that this random uniform distribution draws from the interval that   includes the minval but not the maxval  minval <= x < maxval . To get a tensor with random draws from a normal distribution, as follows: randnorm_tsr = tf.random_normal [row_dim, col_dim],  mean=0.0, stddev=1.0   There are also times when we wish to generate normal random values that  are assured within certain bounds. The truncated_normal   function  always picks normal values within two standard deviations of the specified  mean. See the following: runcnorm_tsr = tf.truncated_normal [row_dim, col_dim],  mean=0.0, stddev=1.0   6     We might also be interested in randomizing entries of arrays. To accomplish   this, there are two functions that help us: random_shuffle   and  random_crop  . See the following: shuffled_output = tf.random_shuffle input_tensor  cropped_output = tf.random_crop input_tensor, crop_size      Later on in this book, we will be interested in randomly cropping an image  of size  height, width, 3  where there are three color spectrums. To fix a  dimension in the cropped_output, you must give it the maximum size in  that dimension: cropped_image = tf.random_crop my_image, [height 2, width 2,  3]   How it works… Once we have decided on how to create the tensors, then we may also create the  corresponding variables by wrapping the tensor in the Variable   function, as follows. More  on this in the next section:  my_var = tf.Variable tf.zeros [row_dim, col_dim]    There's more… We are not limited to the built-in functions. We can convert any numpy array to a Python list, or  constant to a tensor using the function convert_to_tensor  . Note that this function also  accepts tensors as an input in case we wish to generalize a computation inside a function.  Using Placeholders and Variables Placeholders and variables are key tools for using computational graphs in TensorFlow. We  must understand the difference and when to best use them to our advantage.  Getting ready One of the most important distinctions to make with the data is whether it is a placeholder or  a variable. Variables are the parameters of the algorithm and TensorFlow keeps track of how  to change these to optimize the algorithm. Placeholders are objects that allow you to feed in  data of a specific type and shape and depend on the results of the computational graph, such  as the expected outcome of a computation.  7   How to do it… The main way to create a variable is by using the Variable   function, which takes a tensor  as an input and outputs a variable. This is the declaration and we still need to initialize  the variable. Initializing is what puts the variable with the corresponding methods on the  computational graph. Here is an example of creating and initializing a variable:  my_var = tf.Variable tf.zeros [2,3]   sess = tf.Session   initialize_op = tf.global_variables_initializer    sess.run initialize_op   To see what the computational graph looks like after creating and initializing a variable, see  the next part in this recipe.  Placeholders are just holding the position for data to be fed into the graph. Placeholders get  data from a feed_dict argument in the session. To put a placeholder in the graph, we must  perform at least one operation on the placeholder. We initialize the graph, declare x to be a  placeholder, and define y as the identity operation on x, which just returns x. We then create  data to feed into the x placeholder and run the identity operation. It is worth noting that  TensorFlow will not return a self-referenced placeholder in the feed dictionary. The code is  shown here and the resulting graph is shown in the next section:  sess = tf.Session   x = tf.placeholder tf.float32, shape=[2,2]  y = tf.identity x  x_vals = np.random.rand 2,2  sess.run y, feed_dict={x: x_vals}   Note that sess.run x, feed_dict={x: x_vals}  will result in a self- referencing error.  How it works… The computational graph of initializing a variable as a tensor of zeros is shown in the   following figure:  8  Figure 1: Variable   In Figure 1, we can see what the computational graph looks like in detail with just one  variable, initialized to all zeros. The grey shaded region is a very detailed view of the  operations and constants involved. The main computational graph with less detail is the  smaller graph outside of the grey region in the upper right corner. For more details on creating  and visualizing graphs, see Chapter 10, Taking TensorFlow to Production, section 1.  Similarly, the computational graph of feeding a numpy array into a placeholder can be seen in  the following figure:  Figure 2: Here is the computational graph of a placeholder initialized. The grey shaded region is a very detailed view  of the operations and constants involved. The main computational graph with less detail is the smaller graph outside   of the grey region in the upper right.  There's more… During the run of the computational graph, we have to tell TensorFlow when to initialize the  variables we have created. TensorFlow must be informed about when it can initialize the  variables. While each variable has an initializer method, the most common way to do  this is to use the helper function, which is global_variables_initializer  .   This function creates an operation in the graph that initializes all the variables we have  created, as follows:  initializer_op = tf.global_variables_initializer     But if we want to initialize a variable based on the results of initializing another variable, we  have to initialize variables in the order we want, as follows:  sess = tf.Session   first_var = tf.Variable tf.zeros [2,3]   sess.run first_var.initializer  second_var = tf.Variable tf.zeros_like first_var    Depends on first_var sess.run second_var.initializer   9   Working with Matrices Understanding how TensorFlow works with matrices is very important to understanding the  flow of data through computational graphs.  Getting ready Many algorithms depend on matrix operations. TensorFlow gives us easy-to-use operations  to perform such matrix calculations. For all of the following examples, we can create a graph  session by running the following code:  import tensorflow as tf sess = tf.Session    How to do it…  1.  Creating matrices: We can create two-dimensional matrices from numpy arrays or  nested lists, as we described in the earlier section on tensors. We can also use the  tensor creation functions and specify a two-dimensional shape for functions such  as zeros  , ones  , truncated_normal  , and so on. TensorFlow also allows  us to create a diagonal matrix from a one-dimensional array or list with the function  diag  , as follows: identity_matrix = tf.diag [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]  A = tf.truncated_normal [2, 3]  B = tf.fill [2,3], 5.0  C = tf.random_uniform [3,2]  D = tf.convert_to_tensor np.array [[1., 2., 3.],[-3., -7.,  -1.],[0., 5., -2.]]   print sess.run identity_matrix   [[ 1.  0.  0.]  [ 0.  1.  0.]  [ 0.  0.  1.]] print sess.run A   [[ 0.96751703  0.11397751 -0.3438891 ]  [-0.10132604 -0.8432678   0.29810596]] print sess.run B   [[ 5.  5.  5.]  [ 5.  5.  5.]] print sess.run C   [[ 0.33184157  0.08907614]  [ 0.53189191  0.67605299]  [ 0.95889051  0.67061249]]  10   print sess.run D   [[ 1.  2.  3.]  [-3. -7. -1.]  [ 0.  5. -2.]]  Note that if we were to run sess.run C  again, we would reinitialize  the random variables and end up with different random values.  2.  Addition and subtraction uses the following function:  print sess.run A+B   [[ 4.61596632  5.39771316  4.4325695 ]  [ 3.26702736  5.14477345  4.98265553]] print sess.run B-B   [[ 0.  0.  0.]  [ 0.  0.  0.]] Multiplication print sess.run tf.matmul B, identity_matrix    [[ 5.  5.  5.]  [ 5.  5.  5.]]  3.  Also, the function matmul   has arguments that specify whether or not to transpose   the arguments before multiplication or whether each matrix is sparse.  5.  Again, it is worth mentioning the reinitializing that gives us different values    4.  Transpose the arguments as follows:  print sess.run tf.transpose C    [[ 0.67124544  0.26766731  0.99068872]  [ 0.25006068  0.86560275  0.58411312]]  than before.  6.  For the determinant, use the following:  print sess.run tf.matrix_determinant D    -38.0     Inverse:  print sess.run tf.matrix_inverse D    [[-0.5        -0.5        -0.5       ]  [ 0.15789474  0.05263158  0.21052632]  [ 0.39473684  0.13157895  0.02631579]]  11   Note that the inverse method is based on the Cholesky  decomposition if the matrix is symmetric positive definite  or the LU decomposition otherwise.  7.  Decompositions:     For the Cholesky decomposition, use the following: print sess.run tf.cholesky identity_matrix    [[ 1.  0.  1.]  [ 0.  1.  0.]  [ 0.  0.  1.]]  8.  For Eigenvalues and eigenvectors, use the following code:  print sess.run tf.self_adjoint_eig D   [[-10.65907521  -0.22750691   2.88658212]  [  0.21749542   0.63250104  -0.74339638]  [  0.84526515   0.2587998    0.46749277]  [ -0.4880805    0.73004459   0.47834331]]  Note that the function self_adjoint_eig   outputs the eigenvalues in the first row and  the subsequent vectors in the remaining vectors. In mathematics, this is known as the Eigen  decomposition of a matrix.  How it works… TensorFlow provides all the tools for us to get started with numerical computations and  adding such computations to our graphs. This notation might seem quite heavy for simple  matrix operations. Remember that we are adding these operations to the graph and telling  TensorFlow what tensors to run through those operations. While this might seem verbose now,  it helps to understand the notations in later chapters, when this way of computation will make  it easier to accomplish our goals.  Declaring Operations Now we must learn about the other operations we can add to a TensorFlow graph.  12   Getting ready Besides the standard arithmetic operations, TensorFlow provides us with more operations that  we should be aware of. We need to know how to use them before proceeding. Again, we can  create a graph session by running the following code:  import tensorflow as tf sess = tf.Session    How to do it… TensorFlow has the standard operations on tensors: add  , sub  , mul  , and div  .  Note that all of these operations in this section will evaluate the inputs element-wise unless  specified otherwise:  1.  TensorFlow provides some variations of div   and relevant functions. It is worth mentioning that div   returns the same type as the inputs.   2.  This means it really returns the floor of the division  akin to Python 2  if the inputs  are integers. To return the Python 3 version, which casts integers into floats before  dividing and always returning a float, TensorFlow provides the function truediv    function, as shown as follows: print sess.run tf.div 3,4    0 print sess.run tf.truediv 3,4    0.75  3.   If we have floats and want an integer division, we can use the function floordiv  .  Note that this will still return a float, but rounded down to the nearest integer. The  function is shown as follows: print sess.run tf.floordiv 3.0,4.0    0.0  4.  Another important function is mod  . This function returns the remainder after the   division. It is shown as follows: print sess.run tf.mod 22.0, 5.0    2.0  13   5.  The cross-product between two tensors is achieved by the cross   function.   Remember that the cross-product is only defined for two three-dimensional vectors,  so it only accepts two three-dimensional tensors. The function is shown as follows: print sess.run tf.cross [1., 0., 0.], [0., 1., 0.]    [ 0.  0.  1.0]  6.  Here is a compact list of the more common math functions. All of these functions   operate elementwise.  abs    ceil    cos    exp    floor    inv    log    maximum    minimum    neg    pow    round    rsqrt    sign    sin    sqrt    square    Absolute value of one input tensor Ceiling function of one input tensor Cosine function of one input tensor Base e exponential of one input tensor Floor function of one input tensor Multiplicative inverse  1 x  of one input tensor Natural logarithm of one input tensor Element-wise max of two tensors Element-wise min of two tensors Negative of one input tensor The first tensor raised to the second tensor element-wise Rounds one input tensor One over the square root of one tensor Returns -1, 0, or 1, depending on the sign of the tensor Sine function of one input tensor Square root of one input tensor Square of one input tensor  14   7.  Specialty mathematical functions: There are some special math functions that   get used in machine learning that are worth mentioning and TensorFlow has built in  functions for them. Again, these functions operate element-wise, unless specified  otherwise:  erf    erfc    igamma    digamma    Psi function, the derivative of the lgamma   function Gaussian error function, element-wise, of one tensor Complimentary error function of one tensor Lower regularized incomplete gamma function Upper regularized incomplete gamma function Natural logarithm of the absolute value of the beta function Natural logarithm of the absolute value of the gamma function squared_difference   Computes the square of the differences between two tensors  igammac    lgamma    lbeta    How it works… It is important to know what functions are available to us to add to our computational graphs.  Mostly, we will be concerned with the preceding functions. We can also generate many  different custom functions as compositions of the preceding functions, as follows:   Tangent function  tan pi 4 =1  print sess.run tf.div tf.sin 3.1416 4. , tf.cos 3.1416 4.      1.0  There's more… If we wish to add other operations to our graphs that are not listed here, we must create our  own from the preceding functions. Here is an example of an operation not listed previously  that we can add to our graph. We choose to add a custom polynomial function,   :  def custom_polynomial value :     return tf.sub 3 * tf.square value , value  + 10  print sess.run custom_polynomial 11    362  15   Implementing Activation Functions  Getting ready When we start to use neural networks, we will use activation functions regularly because  activation functions are a mandatory part of any neural network. The goal of the activation  function is to adjust weight and bias. In TensorFlow, activation functions are non-linear  operations that act on tensors. They are functions that operate in a similar way to the previous  mathematical operations. Activation functions serve many purposes, but a few main concepts  is that they introduce a non-linearity into the graph while normalizing the outputs. Start a  TensorFlow graph with the following commands:  import tensorflow as tf sess = tf.Session    How to do it… The activation functions live in the neural network  nn  library in TensorFlow. Besides using  built-in activation functions, we can also design our own using TensorFlow operations. We can  import the predefined activation functions  import tensorflow.nn as nn  or be explicit  and write .nn in our function calls. Here, we choose to be explicit with each function call:  1.  The rectified linear unit, known as ReLU, is the most common and basic way to   introduce a non-linearity into neural networks. This function is just max 0,x . It is  continuous but not smooth. It appears as follows: print sess.run tf.nn.relu [-3., 3., 10.]    [  0.  3.  10.]  2.  There will be times when we wish to cap the linearly increasing part of the preceding   ReLU activation function. We can do this by nesting the max 0,x  function into  a min   function. The implementation that TensorFlow has is called the ReLU6  function. This is defined as min max 0,x ,6 . This is a version of the hard- sigmoid function and is computationally faster, and does not suffer from vanishing   infinitesimally near zero  or exploding values. This will come in handy when we  discuss deeper neural networks in Chapters 8, Convolutional Neural Networks and  Chapter 9, Recurrent Neural Networks. It appears as follows: print sess.run tf.nn.relu6 [-3., 3., 10.]    [ 0.  3.  6.]  16   3.  The sigmoid function is the most common continuous and smooth activation   function. It is also called a logistic function and has the form 1  1+exp -x  . The  sigmoid is not often used because of the tendency to zero-out the back propagation  terms during training. It appears as follows: print sess.run tf.nn.sigmoid [-1., 0., 1.]    [ 0.26894143  0.5         0.7310586 ]  We should be aware that some activation functions are not zero  centered, such as the sigmoid. This will require us to zero-mean  the data prior to using it in most computational graph algorithms.  4.  Another smooth activation function is the hyper tangent. The hyper tangent function   is very similar to the sigmoid except that instead of having a range between 0 and  1, it has a range between -1 and 1. The function has the form of the ratio of the  hyperbolic sine over the hyperbolic cosine. But another way to write this is   exp x - exp -x    exp x +exp -x  . It appears as follows: print sess.run tf.nn.tanh [-1., 0., 1.]    [-0.76159418  0.         0.76159418 ]  5.  The softsign function also gets used as an activation function. The form of this  function is x  abs x  + 1 . The softsign function is supposed to be a continuous  approximation to the sign function. It appears as follows: print sess.run tf.nn.softsign [-1., 0., -1.]    [-0.5  0.   0.5]  6.  Another function, the softplus, is a smooth version of the ReLU function. The form   of this function is log exp x  + 1 . It appears as follows: print sess.run tf.nn.softplus [-1., 0., -1.]    [ 0.31326166  0.69314718  1.31326163]  The softplus goes to infinity as the input increases whereas  the softsign goes to 1. As the input gets smaller, however, the  softplus approaches zero and the softsign goes to -1.  7.  The Exponential Linear Unit  ELU  is very similar to the softplus function except  that the bottom asymptote is -1 instead of 0. The form is  exp x +1  if x < 0 else x. It  appears as follows: print sess.run tf.nn.elu [-1., 0., -1.]    [-0.63212055  0.          1.        ]  17   How it works… These activation functions are the way that we introduce nonlinearities in neural networks or  other computational graphs in the future. It is important to note where in our network we are  using activation functions. If the activation function has a range between 0 and 1  sigmoid ,  then the computational graph can only output values between 0 and 1.  If the activation functions are inside and hidden between nodes, then we want to be aware  of the effect that the range can have on our tensors as we pass them through. If our tensors  were scaled to have a mean of zero, we will want to use an activation function that preserves  as much variance as possible around zero. This would imply we want to choose an activation  function such as the hyperbolic tangent  tanh  or softsign. If the tensors are all scaled to  be positive, then we would ideally choose an activation function that preserves variance in the  positive domain.  There's more… Here are two graphs that illustrate the different activation functions. The following figure  shows the following functions ReLU, ReLU6, softplus, exponential LU, sigmoid, softsign, and  the hyperbolic tangent:  Figure 3: Activation functions of softplus, ReLU, ReLU6, and exponential LU  18   In Figure 3, we can see four of the activation functions, softplus, ReLU, ReLU6, and  exponential LU. These functions flatten out to the left of zero and linearly increase to the right  of zero, with the exception of ReLU6, which has a maximum value of 6:  Figure 4: Sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent  tanh , and softsign activation function  In Figure 4, we have the activation functions sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent  tanh , and softsign.  These activation functions are all smooth and have a S n shape. Note that there are two  horizontal asymptotes for these functions.  Working with Data Sources For most of this book, we will rely on the use of datasets to fit machine learning algorithms.  This section has instructions on how to access each of these various datasets through  TensorFlow and Python.  Getting ready In TensorFlow some of the datasets that we will use are built in to Python libraries, some  will require a Python script to download, and some will be manually downloaded through the  Internet. Almost all of these datasets require an active Internet connection to retrieve data.  19   How to do it…  1.   Iris data: This dataset is arguably the most classic dataset used in machine learning  and maybe all of statistics. It is a dataset that measures sepal length, sepal width,  petal length, and petal width of three different types of iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris  virginica, and Iris versicolor. There are 150 measurements overall, 50 measurements  of each species. To load the dataset in Python, we use Scikit Learn's dataset function,  as follows: from sklearn import datasets iris = datasets.load_iris   print len iris.data   150 print len iris.target   150 print iris.target[0]   Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length,  Petal width [ 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2] print set iris.target    I. setosa, I. virginica, I. versicolor {0, 1, 2}  2.  Birth weight data: The University of Massachusetts at Amherst has compiled many  statistical datasets that are of interest  1 . One such dataset is a measure of child  birth weight and other demographic and medical measurements of the mother and  family history. There are 189 observations of 11 variables. Here is how to access the  data in Python: import requests birthdata_url = 'https:  www.umass.edu statdata statdata data  lowbwt.dat' birth_file = requests.get birthdata_url  birth_data = birth_file.text.split '\'r\n'  [5:] birth_header = [x for x in birth_data[0].split  ''  if len x >=1] birth_data = [[float x  for x in y.split  ' '' if len x >=1] for y  in birth_data[1:] if len y >=1] print len birth_data   189 print len birth_data[0]   11  20   3.  Boston Housing data: Carnegie Mellon University maintains a library of datasets in  their Statlib Library. This data is easily accessible via The University of California at  Irvine's Machine-Learning Repository  2 . There are 506 observations of house worth  along with various demographic data and housing attributes  14 variables . Here is  how to access the data in Python: import requests housing_url = 'https:  archive.ics.uci.edu ml machine-learning- databases housing housing.data' housing_header = ['CRIM', 'ZN', 'INDUS', 'CHAS', 'NOX', 'RM',  'AGE', 'DIS', 'RAD', 'TAX', 'PTRATIO', 'B', 'LSTAT', 'MEDV0'] housing_file = requests.get housing_url  housing_data = [[float x  for x in y.split  ''  if len x >=1] for  y in housing_file.text.split '\n'  if len y >=1] print len housing_data   506 print len housing_data[0]   14  4.  MNIST handwriting data: MNIST  Mixed National Institute of Standards and   Technology  is a subset of the larger NIST handwriting database. The MNIST  handwriting dataset is hosted on Yann LeCun's website  https:  yann.lecun. com exdb mnist  . It is a database of 70,000 images of single digit numbers  0-9   with about 60,000 annotated for a training set and 10,000 for a test set. This dataset  is used so often in image recognition that TensorFlow provides built-in functions to  access this data. In machine learning, it is also important to provide validation data  to prevent overfitting  target leakage . Because of this TensorFlow, sets aside 5,000  of the train set into a validation set. Here is how to access the data in Python: from tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist import input_data mnist = input_data.read_data_sets "MNIST_data "," one_hot=True  print len mnist.train.images   55000 print len mnist.test.images   10000 print len mnist.validation.images   5000 print mnist.train.labels[1,:]   The first label is a 3''' [ 0.  0.  0.  1.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.]  21   5.  Spam-ham text data. UCI's machine -learning data set library  2  also holds a spam- ham text message dataset. We can access this .zip file and get the spam-ham text  data as follows: import requests import io from zipfile import ZipFile zip_url = 'http:  archive.ics.uci.edu ml machine-learning- databases 00228 smsspamcollection.zip' r = requests.get zip_url  z = ZipFile io.BytesIO r.content   file = z.read 'SMSSpamCollection'  text_data = file.decode   text_data = text_data.encode 'ascii',errors='ignore'  text_data = text_data.decode  .split \n'  text_data = [x.split \t'  for x in text_data if len x >=1] [text_data_target, text_data_train] = [list x  for x in zip *text_ data ] print len text_data_train   5574 print set text_data_target   {'ham', 'spam'} print text_data_train[1]  Ok lar...

CIFAR-10 image data: The Canadian Institute For Advanced Research has released  an image set that contains 80 million labeled colored images  each image is scaled  to 32x32 pixels . There are 10 different target classes  airplane, automobile, bird,  and so on . The CIFAR-10 is a subset that has 60,000 images. There are 50,000  images in the training set, and 10,000 in the test set. Since we will be using this  dataset in multiple ways, and because it is one of our larger datasets, we will not run  a script each time we need it. To get this dataset, please navigate to http:  www. cs.toronto.edu ~kriz cifar.html, and download the CIFAR-10 dataset. We  will address how to use this dataset in the appropriate chapters.  8.  The works of Shakespeare text data: Project Gutenberg  5  is a project that releases  electronic versions of free books.

From this data, ManyThings.org   http:  www.manythings.org  has compiled sentence-to-sentence translations  in text files available for download. Here we will use the English-German translation  file, but you can change the URL to whatever languages you would like to use: import requests import io from zipfile import ZipFile sentence_url = 'http:  www.manythings.org anki deu-eng.zip' r = requests.get sentence_url  z = ZipFile io.BytesIO r.content   file = z.read 'deu.txt'''   Format Data eng_ger_data = file.decode   eng_ger_data = eng_ger_data.encode 'ascii''',errors='ignore'''  eng_ger_data = eng_ger_data.decode  .split \n'''  eng_ger_data = [x.split \t'''  for x in eng_ger_data if len x >=1] [english_sentence, german_sentence] = [list x  for x in zip *eng_ ger_data ] print len english_sentence   137673 print len german_sentence   137673 print eng_ger_data[10]  ['I won!, 'Ich habe gewonnen!']  How it works… When it comes time to use one of these datasets in a recipe, we will refer you to this   section and assume that the data is loaded in such a way as described in the preceding text.

Then we  will tie it together to create a simple classifier and evaluate the outcomes. By the end of the  chapter you should have learned about the following:   f Operations in a Computational Graph  f Layering Nested Operations  f Working with Multiple Layers  f Implementing Loss Functions  f Implementing Back Propagation  f Working with Batch and Stochastic Training  f Combining Everything Together  f Evaluating Models  Introduction Now that we have introduced how TensorFlow creates tensors, uses variables and  placeholders, we will introduce how to act on these objects in a computational graph.   From this, we can set up a simple classifier and see how well it performs.  Also, remember that all the code from this book is available online on GitHub  at https:  github.com nfmcclure tensorflow_cookbook.  2  27   Operations in a Computational Graph Now that we can put objects into our computational graph, we will introduce operations that  act on such objects.  Getting ready To start a graph, we load TensorFlow and create a session, as follows:  import tensorflow as tf sess = tf.Session    How to do it… In this example, we will combine what we have learned and feed in each number in a list to an  operation in a graph and print the output:  1.  First we declare our tensors and placeholders. Here we will create a numpy array to   feed into our operation: import numpy as np x_vals = np.array [1., 3., 5., 7., 9.]  x_data = tf.placeholder tf.float32  m_const = tf.constant 3.  my_product = tf.mul x_data, m_const  for x_val in x_vals:     print sess.run my_product, feed_dict={x_data: x_val}   3.0 9.0 15.0 21.0 27.0  28   How it works… Steps 1 and 2 create the data and operations on the computational graph. Then, in step 3, we  feed the data through the graph and print the output. Here is what the computational graph  looks like:  Figure 1: Here we can see in the graph that the placeholder, x_data, along with our multiplicative constant, feeds   into the multiplication operation.  Layering Nested Operations In this recipe, we will learn how to put multiple operations on the same computational graph.  Getting ready It's important to know how to chain operations together. This will set up layered operations in  the computational graph. For a demonstration we will multiply a placeholder by two matrices  and then perform addition. We will feed in two matrices in the form of a three-dimensional  numpy array:  import tensorflow as tf sess = tf.Session    29   How to do it… It is also important to note how the data will change shape as it passes through. We will feed  in two numpy arrays of size 3x5. We will multiply each matrix by a constant of size 5x1, which  will result in a matrix of size 3x1. We will then multiply this by 1x1 matrix resulting in a 3x1  matrix again. Finally, we add a 3x1 matrix at the end, as follows:  1.  First we create the data to feed in and the corresponding placeholder:  my_array = np.array [[1., 3., 5., 7., 9.],                    [-2., 0., 2., 4., 6.],                    [-6., -3., 0., 3., 6.]]  x_vals = np.array [my_array, my_array + 1]  x_data = tf.placeholder tf.float32, shape= 3, 5    2.  Next we create the constants that we will use for matrix multiplication and addition:  m1 = tf.constant [[1.],[0.],[-1.],[2.],[4.]]  m2 = tf.constant [[2.]]  a1 = tf.constant [[10.]]   3.  Now we declare the operations and add them to the graph:  prod1 = tf.matmul x_data, m1  prod2 = tf.matmul prod1, m2  add1 = tf.add prod2, a1   4.  Finally, we feed the data through our graph:  for x_val in x_vals:     print sess.run add1, feed_dict={x_data: x_val}   [[ 102.]  [  66.]  [  58.]] [[ 114.]  [  78.]  [  70.]]  How it works… The computational graph we just created can be visualized with Tensorboard. Tensorboard  is a feature of TensorFlow that allows us to visualize the computational graphs and values in  that graph. These features are provided natively, unlike other machine learning frameworks.  To see how this is done, see the Visualizing graphs in Tensorboard recipe in Chapter 11, More  with TensorFlow. Here is what our layered graph looks like:  30   Figure 2: In this computational graph you can see the data size as it propagates upward through the graph.  There's more… We have to declare the data shape and know the outcome shape of the operations before we  run data through the graph. This is not always the case. There may be a dimension or two that  we do not know beforehand or that can vary. To accomplish this, we designate the dimension  that can vary or is unknown as value none. For example, to have the prior data placeholder  have an unknown amount of columns, we would write the following line:  x_data = tf.placeholder tf.float32, shape= 3,None    This allows us to break matrix multiplication rules and we must still obey the fact that the  multiplying constant must have the same corresponding number of rows. We can either  generate this dynamically or reshape the x_data as we feed data in our graph. This will come  in handy in later chapters when we are feeding data in multiple batches.  31   Working with Multiple Layers Now that we have covered multiple operations, we will cover how to connect various layers  that have data propagating through them.  Getting ready In this recipe, we will introduce how to best connect various layers, including custom layers.  The data we will generate and use will be representative of small random images. It is best to  understand these types of operation on a simple example and how we can use some built-in  layers to perform calculations. We will perform a small moving window average across a 2D  image and then flow the resulting output through a custom operation layer.  In this section, we will see that the computational graph can get large and hard to look at. To  address this, we will also introduce ways to name operations and create scopes for layers. To  start, load numpy and tensorflow and create a graph, using the following:  import tensorflow as tf import numpy as np sess = tf.Session    How to do it…  1.  First we create our sample 2D image with numpy. This image will be a 4x4 pixel  image. We will create it in four dimensions; the first and last dimension will have  a size of one. Note that some TensorFlow image functions will operate on four- dimensional images. Those four dimensions are image number, height, width, and  channel, and to make it one image with one channel, we set two of the dimensions to  1, as follows: x_shape = [1, 4, 4, 1] x_val = np.random.uniform size=x_shape   2.  Now we have to create the placeholder in our graph where we can feed in the sample   image, as follows: x_data = tf.placeholder tf.float32, shape=x_shape   32   3.  To create a moving window average across our 4x4 image, we will use a built-in  function that will convolute a constant across a window of the shape 2x2. This  function is quite common to use in image processing and in TensorFlow, the function  we will use is conv2d  . This function takes a piecewise product of the window  and a filter we specify. We must also specify a stride for the moving window in both  directions. Here we will compute four moving window averages, the top left, top right,  bottom left, and bottom right four pixels. We do this by creating a 2x2 window and  having strides of length 2 in each direction. To take the average, we will convolute the  2x2 window with a constant of 0.25., as follows: my_filter = tf.constant 0.25, shape=[2, 2, 1, 1]  my_strides = [1, 2, 2, 1] mov_avg_layer= tf.nn.conv2d x_data, my_filter, my_strides,                             padding='SAME''', name='Moving'_Avg_ Window'   To figure out the output size of a convolutional layer, we can use the  following formula: Output =  W-F+2P  S+1, where W is the input size,  F is the filter size, P is the padding of zeros, and S is the stride.  4.  Note that we are also naming this layer Moving_Avg_Window by using the name   argument of the function.  5.  Now we define a custom layer that will operate on the 2x2 output of the moving  window average. The custom function will first multiply the input by another 2x2  matrix tensor, and then add one to each entry. After this we take the sigmoid of  each element and return the 2x2 matrix. Since matrix multiplication only operates on  two-dimensional matrices, we need to drop the extra dimensions of our image that  are of size 1. TensorFlow can do this with the built-in function squeeze  . Here we  define the new layer: def custom_layer input_matrix :     input_matrix_sqeezed = tf.squeeze input_matrix      A = tf.constant [[1., 2.], [-1., 3.]]      b = tf.constant 1., shape=[2, 2]      temp1 = tf.matmul A, input_matrix_sqeezed      temp = tf.add temp1, b   Ax + b     return tf.sigmoid temp    6.  Now we have to place the new layer on the graph. We will do this with a named scope   so that it is identifiable and collapsible expandable on the computational graph, as  follows: with tf.name_scope 'Custom_Layer'  as scope:     custom_layer1 = custom_layer mov_avg_layer   33   7.  Now we just feed in the 4x4 image in the placeholder and tell TensorFlow to run the   graph, as follows: print sess.run custom_layer1, feed_dict={x_data: x_val}   [[ 0.91914582  0.96025133]  [ 0.87262219  0.9469803 ]]  How it works… The visualized graph looks better with the naming of operations and scoping of layers. We  can collapse and expand the custom layer because we created it in a named scope. In the  following figure, see the collapsed version on the left and the expanded version on the right:  Figure 3: Computational graph with two layers. The first layer is named as Moving_Avg_Window, and the   second is a collection of operations called Custom_Layer. It is collapsed on the left and expanded on the right.  34   Implementing Loss Functions Loss functions are very important to machine learning algorithms. They measure the distance  between the model outputs and the target  truth  values. In this recipe, we show various loss  function implementations in TensorFlow.  Getting ready In order to optimize our machine learning algorithms, we will need to evaluate the outcomes.  Evaluating outcomes in TensorFlow depends on specifying a loss function. A loss function  tells TensorFlow how good or bad the predictions are compared to the desired result. In most  cases, we will have a set of data and a target on which to train our algorithm. The loss function  compares the target to the prediction and gives a numerical distance between the two.  For this recipe, we will cover the main loss functions that we can implement in TensorFlow.  To see how the different loss functions operate, we will plot them in this recipe. We will first  start a computational graph and load matplotlib, a python plotting library, as follows:  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import tensorflow as tf  How to do it… First we will talk about loss functions for regression, that is, predicting a continuous  dependent variable. To start, we will create a sequence of our predictions and a target as  a tensor. We will output the results across 500 x-values between -1 and 1. See the next  section for a plot of the outputs. Use the following code:  x_vals = tf.linspace -1., 1., 500  target = tf.constant 0.   1.  The L2 norm loss is also known as the Euclidean loss function. It is just the square  of the distance to the target. Here we will compute the loss function as if the target  is zero. The L2 norm is a great loss function because it is very curved near the  target and algorithms can use this fact to converge to the target more slowly, the  closer it gets., as follows: l2_y_vals = tf.square target - x_vals  l2_y_out = sess.run l2_y_vals   TensorFlow has a built -in form of the L2 norm, called nn.l2_loss  .  This function is actually half the L2-norm above. In other words, it is  same as previously but divided by 2.  35   2.  The L1 norm loss is also known as the absolute loss function. Instead of squaring   the difference, we take the absolute value. The L1 norm is better for outliers than  the L2 norm because it is not as steep for larger values. One issue to be aware of  is that the L1 norm is not smooth at the target and this can result in algorithms not  converging well. It appears as follows: l1_y_vals = tf.abs target - x_vals  l1_y_out = sess.run l1_y_vals   3.  Pseudo-Huber loss is a continuous and smooth approximation to the Huber loss  function. This loss function attempts to take the best of the L1 and L2 norms by  being convex near the target and less steep for extreme values. The form depends on  an extra parameter, delta, which dictates how steep it will be. We will plot two forms,  delta1 = 0.25 and delta2 = 5 to show the difference, as follows: delta1 = tf.constant 0.25  phuber1_y_vals = tf.mul tf.square delta1 , tf.sqrt 1. +                          tf.square  target - x_vals  delta1   - 1.  phuber1_y_out = sess.run phuber1_y_vals  delta2 = tf.constant 5.  phuber2_y_vals = tf.mul tf.square delta2 , tf.sqrt 1. +                          tf.square  target - x_vals  delta2   - 1.  phuber2_y_out = sess.run phuber2_y_vals   4.  Classification loss functions are used to evaluate loss when predicting categorical   outcomes.  5.  We will need to redefine our predictions  x_vals  and target. We will save the   outputs and plot them in the next section. Use the following: x_vals = tf.linspace -3., 5., 500  target = tf.constant 1.  targets = tf.fill [500,], 1.   6.  Hinge loss is mostly used for support vector machines, but can be used in neural  networks as well. It is meant to compute a loss between with two target classes, 1  and -1. In the following code, we are using the target value 1, so the as closer our  predictions as near are to 1, the lower the loss value: hinge_y_vals = tf.maximum 0., 1. - tf.mul target, x_vals   hinge_y_out = sess.run hinge_y_vals   36   7.  Cross-entropy loss for a binary case is also sometimes referred to as the logistic loss   function. It comes about when we are predicting the two classes 0 or 1. We wish to  measure a distance from the actual class  0 or 1  to the predicted value, which is  usually a real number between 0 and 1. To measure this distance, we can use the  cross entropy formula from information theory, as follows: xentropy_y_vals = - tf.mul target, tf.log x_vals   - tf.mul  1. -  target , tf.log 1. - x_vals   xentropy_y_out = sess.run xentropy_y_vals   8.  Sigmoid cross entropy loss is very similar to the previous loss function   except we transform the x-values by the sigmoid function before we put them in  the cross entropy loss, as follows: xentropy_sigmoid_y_vals = tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_ logits x_vals, targets  xentropy_sigmoid_y_out = sess.run xentropy_sigmoid_y_vals   9.  Weighted cross entropy loss is a weighted version of the sigmoid cross entropy   loss. We provide a weight on the positive target. For an example, we will weight the  positive target by 0.5, as follows: weight = tf.constant 0.5  xentropy_weighted_y_vals = tf.nn.weighted_cross_entropy_with_ logits x_vals, targets, weight  xentropy_weighted_y_out = sess.run xentropy_weighted_y_vals   10.  Softmax cross-entropy loss operates on non-normalized outputs. This function  is used to measure a loss when there is only one target category instead of multiple.  Because of this, the function transforms the outputs into a probability distribution via  the softmax function and then computes the loss function from a true probability  distribution, as follows: unscaled_logits = tf.constant [[1., -3., 10.]]  target_dist = tf.constant [[0.1, 0.02, 0.88]]  softmax_xentropy = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_ logits unscaled_logits, target_dist  print sess.run softmax_xentropy   [ 1.16012561]  37   11.  Sparse softmax cross-entropy loss is the same as previously, except instead  of the target being a probability distribution, it is an index of which category is true.  Instead of a sparse all-zero target vector with one value of one, we just pass in the  index of which category is the true value, as follows: unscaled_logits = tf.constant [[1., -3., 10.]]  sparse_target_dist = tf.constant [2]  sparse_xentropy = tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_ logits unscaled_logits, sparse_target_dist  print sess.run sparse_xentropy   [ 0.00012564]  How it works… Here is how to use matplotlib to plot the regression loss functions:  x_array = sess.run x_vals  plt.plot x_array, l2_y_out, 'b-', label='L2 Loss'  plt.plot x_array, l1_y_out, 'r--', label='L1 Loss'  plt.plot x_array, phuber1_y_out, 'k-.', label='P-Huber Loss  0.25 '  plt.plot x_array, phuber2_y_out, 'g:', label='P'-Huber Loss  5.0 '  plt.ylim -0.2, 0.4  plt.legend loc='lower right', prop={'size': 11}  plt.show    Figure 4: Plotting various regression loss functions.  38   And here is how to use matplotlib to plot the various classification loss functions:  x_array = sess.run x_vals  plt.plot x_array, hinge_y_out, 'b-', label='Hinge Loss'  plt.plot x_array, xentropy_y_out, 'r--', label='Cross Entropy Loss'  plt.plot x_array, xentropy_sigmoid_y_out, 'k-.', label='Cross Entropy  Sigmoid Loss'  plt.plot x_array, xentropy_weighted_y_out, g:', label='Weighted Cross  Enropy Loss  x0.5 '  plt.ylim -1.5, 3  plt.legend loc='lower right', prop={'size': 11}  plt.show    Figure 5: Plots of classification loss functions.  There's more… Here is a table summarizing the different loss functions that we have described:  Loss function L2 L1 Psuedo-Huber Hinge  Use Regression Regression Regression Classification  Benefits More stable More robust More robust and stable Creates a max margin for  use in SVM  Disadvantages Less robust Less stable One more parameter Unbounded loss  affected by outliers  39   Loss function Cross-entropy  Use Classification  Benefits More stable  Disadvantages Unbounded loss, less  robust  The remaining classification loss functions all have to do with the type of cross-entropy loss.  The cross-entropy sigmoid loss function is for use on unscaled logits and is preferred over  computing the sigmoid, and then the cross entropy, because TensorFlow has better built-in  ways to handle numerical edge cases. The same goes for softmax cross entropy and  sparse softmax cross entropy.  Most of the classification loss functions described here are for  two class predictions. This can be extended to multiple classes via  summing the cross entropy terms over each prediction target.  There are also many other metrics to look at when evaluating a model. Here is a list of some  more to consider:  Model metric R-squared  coefficient of determination   RMSE  root mean squared error   Confusion matrix  Description For linear models, this is the proportion of  variance in the dependent variable that is  explained by the independent data. For continuous models, measures the difference  between predictions and actual via the square  root of the average squared error. For categorical models, we look at a matrix of  predicted categories versus actual categories.  A perfect model has all the counts along the  diagonal. For categorical models, this is the fraction of true  positives over all predicted positives. For categorical models, this is the fraction of true  positives over all actual positives. For categorical models, this is the harmonic mean  of precision and recall.  Recall  Precision  F-score  40   Implementing Back Propagation One of the benefits of using TensorFlow, is that it can keep track of operations and  automatically update model variables based on back propagation. In this recipe, we will  introduce how to use this aspect to our advantage when training machine learning models.  Getting ready Now we will introduce how to change our variables in the model in such a way that a loss  function is minimized. We have learned about how to use objects and operations, and create  loss functions that will measure the distance between our predictions and targets. Now  we just have to tell TensorFlow how to back propagate errors through our computational  graph to update the variables and minimize the loss function. This is done via declaring an  optimization function. Once we have an optimization function declared, TensorFlow will go  through and figure out the back propagation terms for all of our computations in the graph.  When we feed data in and minimize the loss function, TensorFlow will modify our variables in  the graph accordingly.  For this recipe, we will do a very simple regression algorithm. We will sample random numbers  from a normal, with mean 1 and standard deviation 0.1. Then we will run the numbers  through one operation, which will be to multiply them by a variable, A. From this, the loss  function will be the L2 norm between the output and the target, which will always be the value  10. Theoretically, the best value for A will be the number 10 since our data will have mean 1.  The second example is a very simple binary classification algorithm. Here we will generate  100 numbers from two normal distributions, N -1,1  and N 3,1 . All the numbers from N -1, 1   will be in target class 0, and all the numbers from N 3, 1  will be in target class 1. The model  to differentiate these numbers will be a sigmoid function of a translation. In other words,  the model will be sigmoid  x + A  where A is a variable we will fit. Theoretically, A will be  equal to -1. We arrive at this number because if m1 and m2 are the means of the two normal  functions, the value added to them to translate them equidistant to zero will be – m1+m2  2.  We will see how TensorFlow can arrive at that number in the second example.  While specifying a good learning rate helps the convergence of algorithms, we  must also specify a type of optimization. From the preceding two examples, we are  using standard gradient descent. This is implemented with the TensorFlow function  GradientDescentOptimizer  .  41   1.  We start by loading the numerical Python package, numpy and tensorflow:  How to do it… Here is how the regression example works:  import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf  2.  Now we start a graph session:  sess = tf.Session    3.  Next we create the data, placeholders, and the A variable:  x_vals = np.random.normal 1, 0.1, 100  y_vals = np.repeat 10., 100  x_data = tf.placeholder shape=[1], dtype=tf.float32  y_target = tf.placeholder shape=[1], dtype=tf.float32  A = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1]    4.  We add the multiplication operation to our graph:  my_output = tf.mul x_data, A   5.  Next we add our L2 loss function between the multiplication output and the target   data: loss = tf.square my_output - y_target   6.  Before we can run anything, we have to initialize the variables:  init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   7.  Now we have to declare a way to optimize the variables in our graph. We declare   an optimizer algorithm. Most optimization algorithms need to know how far to step  in each iteration. This distance is controlled by the learning rate. If our learning  rate is too big, our algorithm might overshoot the minimum, but if our learning rate  is too small, out algorithm might take too long to converge; this is related to the  vanishing and exploding gradient problem. The learning rate has a big influence  on convergence and we will discuss this at the end of the section. While here we  use the standard gradient descent algorithm, there are many different optimization  algorithms that operate differently and can do better or worse depending on the  problem. For a great overview of different optimization algorithms, see the paper by  Sebastian Ruder in the See Also section at the end of this recipe: my_opt = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer learning_rate=0.02  train_step = my_opt.minimize loss   42   There is much theory on what learning rates are best. This is one of the  harder things to know and figure out in machine learning algorithms. Good  papers to read about how learning rates are related to specific optimization  algorithms are listed in the There's more… section at the end of this recipe.  8.  The final step is to loop through our training algorithm and tell TensorFlow to train  many times. We will do this 101 times and print out results every 25th iteration.   To train, we will select a random x and y entry and feed it through the graph.  TensorFlow will automatically compute the loss, and slightly change the A bias to  minimize the loss: for i in range 100 :     rand_index = np.random.choice 100      rand_x = [x_vals[rand_index]]     rand_y = [y_vals[rand_index]]     sess.run train_step, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_target:  rand_y}      if  i+1 %25==0:         print 'Step ' + str i+1  + ' A = ' + str sess.run A            print 'Loss = ' + str sess.run loss, feed_dict={x_data:  rand_x, y_target: rand_y}    Here is the output: Step 25 A = [ 6.23402166] Loss = 16.3173 Step 50 A = [ 8.50733757] Loss = 3.56651 Step 75 A = [ 9.37753201] Loss = 3.03149 Step 100 A = [ 9.80041122] Loss = 0.0990248  9.  Now we will introduce the code for the simple classification example. We can use the  same TensorFlow script if we reset the graph first. Remember we will attempt to find  an optimal translation, A that will translate the two distributions to the origin and the  sigmoid function will split the two into two different classes.  10.  First we reset the graph and reinitialize the graph session:  from tensorflow.python.framework import ops ops.reset_default_graph   sess = tf.Session    43   11.  Next we will create the data from two different normal distributions, N -1, 1  and N 3,   1 . We will also generate the target labels, placeholders for the data, and the bias  variable, A: x_vals = np.concatenate  np.random.normal -1, 1, 50 , np.random. normal 3, 1, 50    y_vals = np.concatenate  np.repeat 0., 50 , np.repeat 1., 50    x_data = tf.placeholder shape=[1], dtype=tf.float32  y_target = tf.placeholder shape=[1], dtype=tf.float32  A = tf.Variable tf.random_normal mean=10, shape=[1]    Note that we initialized A to around the value 10, far from the theoretical  value of -1. We did this on purpose to show how the algorithm converges  from the value 10 to the optimal value, -1.  12. Next we add the translation operation to the graph. Remember that we do not have to   wrap this in a sigmoid function because the loss function will do that for us: my_output = tf.add x_data, A   13.  Because the specific loss function expects batches of data that have an extra   dimension associated with them  an added dimension which is the batch number ,  we will add an extra dimension to the output with the function, expand_dims   In  the next section we will discuss how to use variable sized batches in training. For  now, we will again just use one random data point at a time: my_output_expanded = tf.expand_dims my_output, 0  y_target_expanded = tf.expand_dims y_target, 0   14.  Next we will initialize our one variable, A:  init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   15.  Now we declare our loss function. We will use a cross entropy with unscaled   logits that transforms them with a sigmoid function. TensorFlow has this all in  one function for us in the neural network package called nn.sigmoid_cross_ entropy_with_logits  . As stated before, it expects the arguments to have  specific dimensions, so we have to use the expanded outputs and targets accordingly: xentropy = tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits  my_output_ expanded, y_target_expanded   16.  Just like the regression example, we need to add an optimizer function to the graph   so that TensorFlow knows how to update the bias variable in the graph: my_opt = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer 0.05  train_step = my_opt.minimize xentropy   44   17.  Finally, we loop through a randomly selected data point several hundred times and  update the variable A accordingly. Every 200 iterations, we will print out the value of  A and the loss: for i in range 1400 :     rand_index = np.random.choice 100      rand_x = [x_vals[rand_index]]     rand_y = [y_vals[rand_index]]          sess.run train_step, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_target:  rand_y}      if  i+1 %200==0:         print 'Step ' + str i+1  + ' A = ' + str sess.run A            print 'Loss = ' + str sess.run xentropy, feed_dict={x_ data: rand_x, y_target: rand_y}    Step 200 A = [ 3.59597969] Loss = [[ 0.00126199]] Step 400 A = [ 0.50947344] Loss = [[ 0.01149425]] Step 600 A = [-0.50994617] Loss = [[ 0.14271219]] Step 800 A = [-0.76606178] Loss = [[ 0.18807337]] Step 1000 A = [-0.90859312] Loss = [[ 0.02346182]] Step 1200 A = [-0.86169094] Loss = [[ 0.05427232]] Step 1400 A = [-1.08486211] Loss = [[ 0.04099189]]  How it works… As a recap, for both examples, we did the following:  1.  Created the data. 2.  3.  4.  5.  And finally, iterated across random data samples to iteratively update our variables.   Initialized placeholders and variables.  Created a loss function.  Defined an optimization algorithm.  45   There's more… We've mentioned before that the optimization algorithm is sensitive to the choice of the  learning rate. It is important to summarize the effect of this choice in a concise manner:  Learning rate size Smaller learning rate  Larger learning rate  Advantages Disadvantages Converges slower but more  accurate results. Less accurate, but converges  faster.  Uses If solution is unstable, try  lowering the learning rate first. For some problems, helps  prevent solutions from  stagnating.  Sometimes the standard gradient descent algorithm can get stuck or slow down significantly.  This can happen when the optimization is stuck in the flat spot of a saddle. To combat  this, there is another algorithm that takes into account a momentum term, which adds on  a fraction of the prior step's gradient descent value. TensorFlow has this built in with the  MomentumOptimizer   function.  Another variant is to vary the optimizer step for each variable in our models. Ideally, we  would like to take larger steps for smaller moving variables and shorter steps for faster  changing variables. We will not go into the mathematics of this approach, but a common  implementation of this idea is called the Adagrad algorithm. This algorithm takes into account  the whole history of the variable gradients. Again, the function in TensorFlow for this is called  AdagradOptimizer  .  Sometimes, Adagrad forces the gradients to zero too soon because it takes into account the  whole history. A solution to this is to limit how many steps we use. Doing this is called the  Adadelta algorithm. We can apply this by using the function AdadeltaOptimizer  .  There are a few other implementations of different gradient descent algorithms. For these, we  would refer the reader to the TensorFlow documentation at: https:  www.tensorflow. org api_docs python train optimizers.  46   See also For some references on optimization algorithms and learning rates, see the following papers  and articles:   f Kingma, D., Jimmy, L.

Operating on one training example can make for a very erratic learning process, while  using a too large batch can be computationally expensive. Choosing the right type of training  is crucial to getting our machine learning algorithms to converge to a solution.  Getting ready In order for TensorFlow to compute the variable gradients for back propagation to work, we  have to measure the loss on a sample or multiple samples. Stochastic training is only putting  through one randomly sampled data-target pair at a time, just like we did in the previous  recipe. Another option is to put a larger portion of the training examples in at a time and  average the loss for the gradient calculation. Batch training size can vary up to and including  the whole dataset at once. Here we will show how to extend the prior regression example,  which used stochastic training to batch training.  We will start by loading numpy, matplotlib, and tensorflow and start a graph session, as  follows:  import matplotlib as plt import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf sess = tf.Session    47   How to do it…  1.  We will start by declaring a batch size. This will be how many data observations we   will feed through the computational graph at one time: batch_size = 20  2.  Next we declare the data, placeholders, and the variable in the model. The change  we make here is tothat we change the shape of the placeholders. They are now two  dimensions, where the first dimension is None, and second will be the number of  data points in the batch. We could have explicitly set it to 20, but we can generalize  and use the None value. Again, as mentioned in Chapter 1, Getting Started with  TensorFlow, we still have to make sure that the dimensions work out in the model  and this does not allow us to perform any illegal matrix operations: x_vals = np.random.normal 1, 0.1, 100  y_vals = np.repeat 10., 100  x_data = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32  y_target = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32  A = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1,1]    3.  Now we add our operation to the graph, which will now be matrix multiplication   instead of regular multiplication. Remember that matrix multiplication is not  communicative so we have to enter the matrices in the correct order in the  matmul   function: my_output = tf.matmul x_data, A   4.  Our loss function will change because we have to take the mean of all the L2 losses   of each data point in the batch. We do this by wrapping our prior loss output in  TensorFlow's reduce_mean   function: loss = tf.reduce_mean tf.square my_output - y_target    5.  We declare our optimizer just like we did before:  my_opt = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer 0.02  train_step = my_opt.minimize loss   6.  Finally, we will loop through and iterate on the training step to optimize the algorithm.   This part is different than before because we want to be able to plot the loss over  versus stochastic training convergence. So we initialize a list to store the loss  function every five intervals: loss_batch = [] for i in range 100 :     rand_index = np.random.choice 100, size=batch_size      rand_x = np.transpose [x_vals[rand_index]]      rand_y = np.transpose [y_vals[rand_index]]   48       sess.run train_step, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_target:  rand_y}      if  i+1 %5==0:         print 'Step ' + str i+1  + ' A = ' + str sess.run A            temp_loss = sess.run loss, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_ target: rand_y}          print 'Loss = ' + str temp_loss           loss_batch.append temp_loss   7.  Here is the final output of the 100 iterations. Notice that the value of A has an extra   dimension because it now has to be a 2D matrix: Step 100 A = [[ 9.86720943]] Loss = 0.  How it works… Batch training and stochastic training differ in their optimization method and their  convergence. Finding a good batch size can be difficult. To see how convergence differs  between batch and stochastic, here is the code to plot the batch loss from above. There is  also a variable here that contains the stochastic loss, but that computation follows from the  prior section in this chapter. Here is the code to save and record the stochastic loss in the  training loop. Just substitute this code in the prior recipe:  loss_stochastic = [] for i in range 100 :     rand_index = np.random.choice 100      rand_x = [x_vals[rand_index]]     rand_y = [y_vals[rand_index]]     sess.run train_step, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_target: rand_y}      if  i+1 %5==0:         print 'Step ' + str i+1  + ' A = ' + str sess.run A            temp_loss = sess.run loss, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_ target: rand_y}          print 'Loss = ' + str temp_loss           loss_stochastic.append temp_loss   49   Here is the code to produce the plot of both the stochastic and batch loss for the same  regression problem:  plt.plot range 0, 100, 5 , loss_stochastic, 'b-', label='Stochastic  Loss'  plt.plot range 0, 100, 5 , loss_batch, 'r--', label='Batch' Loss,  size=20'  plt.legend loc='upper right', prop={'size': 11}  plt.show    Figure 6: Stochastic loss and batch loss  batch size = 20  plotted over 100 iterations. Note that the batch loss is   much smoother and the stochastic loss is much more erratic.  There's more…  Type of training Stochastic  Batch  Advantages Randomness may help move out of  local minimums. Finds minimums quicker.  Disadvantages Generally, needs more iterations to  converge. Takes more resources to compute.  50   Combining Everything Together In this section, we will combine everything we have illustrated so far and create a classifier on  the iris dataset.  Getting ready The iris data set is described in more detail in the Working with Data Sources recipe in  Chapter 1, Getting Started with TensorFlow. We will load this data, and do a simple binary  classifier to predict whether a flower is the species Iris setosa or not. To be clear, this dataset  has three classes of species, but we will only predict whether it is a single species  I. setosa   or not, giving us a binary classifier. We will start by loading the libraries and data, then  transform the target accordingly.  How to do it…  1.  First we load the libraries needed and initialize the computational graph. Note that   we also load matplotlib here, because we would like to plot the resulting line after: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np from sklearn import datasets import tensorflow as tf sess = tf.Session    2.  Next we load the iris data. We will also need to transform the target data to be just 1  or 0 if the target is setosa or not. Since the iris data set marks setosa as a zero, we  will change all targets with the value 0 to 1, and the other values all to 0. We will also  only use two features, petal length and petal width. These two features are the third  and fourth entry in each x-value: iris = datasets.load_iris   binary_target = np.array [1. if x==0 else 0. for x in iris. target]  iris_2d = np.array [[x[2], x[3]] for x in iris.data]   3.  Let's declare our batch size, data placeholders, and model variables. Remember that   the data placeholders for variable batch sizes have None as the first dimension: batch_size = 20 x1_data = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32  x2_data = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32  y_target = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32  A = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1, 1]   b = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1, 1]    51   Note that we can increase the performance  speed  of the algorithm by  decreasing the bytes for floats by using dtype=tf.float32 instead.  4.  Here we define the linear model. The model will take the form x2=x1*A+b. And if  we want to find points above or below that line, we see whether they are above or  below zero when plugged into the equation x2-x1*A-b. We will do this by taking the  sigmoid of that equation and predicting 1 or 0 from that equation. Remember that  TensorFlow has loss functions with the sigmoid built in, so we just need to define  the output of the model prior to the sigmoid function: my_mult = tf.matmul x2_data, A  my_add = tf.add my_mult, b  my_output = tf.sub x1_data, my_add   5.  Now we add our sigmoid cross-entropy loss function with TensorFlow's built in   function, sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits  : xentropy = tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits my_output, y_ target   6.  We also have to tell TensorFlow how to optimize our computational graph by declaring   an optimizing method. We will want to minimize the cross-entropy loss. We will also  choose 0.05 as our learning rate: my_opt = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer 0.05  train_step = my_opt.minimize xentropy   7.  Now we create a variable initialization operation and tell TensorFlow to execute it:  init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   8.  Now we will train our linear model with 1000 iterations. We will feed in the three data   points that we require: petal length, petal width, and the target variable. Every 200  iterations we will print the variable values: for i in range 1000 :     rand_index = np.random.choice len iris_2d , size=batch_size      rand_x = iris_2d[rand_index]     rand_x1 = np.array [[x[0]] for x in rand_x]      rand_x2 = np.array [[x[1]] for x in rand_x]      rand_y = np.array [[y] for y in binary_target[rand_index]]      sess.run train_step, feed_dict={x1_data: rand_x1, x2_data:  rand_x2, y_target: rand_y}      if  i+1 %200==0:  52           print 'Step ' + str i+1  + ' A = ' + str sess.run A   +  ', b = ' + str sess.run b    Step 200 A = [[ 8.67285347]], b = [[-3.47147632]] Step 400 A = [[ 10.25393486]], b = [[-4.62928772]] Step 600 A = [[ 11.152668]], b = [[-5.4077611]] Step 800 A = [[ 11.81016064]], b = [[-5.96689034]] Step 1000 A = [[ 12.41202831]], b = [[-6.34769201]]  9.  The next set of commands extracts the model variables, and plots the line on a   graph. The resulting graph is in the next section: [[slope]] = sess.run A  [[intercept]] = sess.run b  x = np.linspace 0, 3, num=50  ablineValues = [] for i in x:   ablineValues.append slope*i+intercept  setosa_x = [a[1] for i,a in enumerate iris_2d  if binary_ target[i]==1] setosa_y = [a[0] for i,a in enumerate iris_2d  if binary_ target[i]==1] non_setosa_x = [a[1] for i,a in enumerate iris_2d  if binary_ target[i]==0] non_setosa_y = [a[0] for i,a in enumerate iris_2d  if binary_ target[i]==0] plt.plot setosa_x, setosa_y, 'rx', ms=10, mew=2, label='setosa'''  plt.plot non_setosa_x, non_setosa_y, 'ro', label='Non-setosa'  plt.plot x, ablineValues, 'b-'  plt.xlim [0.0, 2.7]  plt.ylim [0.0, 7.1]  plt.suptitle 'Linear' Separator For I.setosa', fontsize=20  plt.xlabel 'Petal Length'  plt.ylabel 'Petal Width'  plt.legend loc='lower right'  plt.show    53   How it works… Our goal was to fit a line between the I.setosa points and the other two species using only  petal width and petal length. If we plot the points and the resulting line, we see that we have  achieved the following:  Figure 7: Plot of I.setosa and non-setosa for petal width vs petal length. The solid line is the linear separator that we   achieved after 1,000 iterations.  There's more… While we achieved our objective of separating the two classes with a line, it may not be the  best model for separating two classes. In Chapter 4, Support Vector Machines we will discuss  support vector machines, which is a better way of separating two classes in a feature space.

After  this is accomplished, we must be able to evaluate the model's predictions to determine how  well it did.  Getting ready Evaluating models is very important and every subsequent model will have some form of  model evaluation. Using TensorFlow, we must build this feature into the computational graph  and call it during and or after our model is training.  Evaluating models during training gives us insight into the algorithm and may give us hints to  debug it, improve it, or change models entirely. While evaluation during training isn't always  necessary, we will show how to do this with both regression and classification.  After training, we need to quantify how the model performs on the data. Ideally, we have a  separate training and test set  and even a validation set  on which we can evaluate the model.  When we want to evaluate a model, we will want to do so on a large batch of data points.  If we have implemented batch training, we can reuse our model to make a prediction on  such a batch. If we have implemented stochastic training, we may have to create a separate  evaluator that can process data in batches.  If we included a transformation on our model output in the loss function, for  example, sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits  , we must take  that into account when computing predictions for accuracy calculations. Don't  forget to include this in our evaluation of the model.  How to do it… Regression models attempt to predict a continuous number. The target is not a category, but a  desired number. To evaluate these regression predictions against the actual targets, we need  an aggregate measure of the distance between the two. Most of the time, a meaningful loss  function will satisfy these criteria. Here is how to change the simple regression algorithm from  above into printing out the loss in the training loop and evaluating the loss at the end. For  an example, we will revisit and rewrite our regression example in the prior Implementing Back  Propagation recipe in this chapter.  55   Classification models predict a category based on numerical inputs. The actual targets   are a sequence of 1s and 0s and we must have a measure of how close we are to the   truth from our predictions. The loss function for classification models usually isn't that  helpful in interpreting how well our model is doing. Usually, we want some sort of classification  accuracy, which is commonly the percentage of correctly predicted categories. For this  example, we will use the classification example from the prior Implementing Back Propagation  recipe in this chapter.  How it works… First we will show how to evaluate the simple regression model that simply fits a constant  multiplication to the target of 10, as follows:  1.  First we start by loading the libraries, creating the graph, data, variables, and   placeholders. There is an additional part to this section that is very important. After  we create the data, we will split the data into training and testing datasets randomly.  This is important because we will always test our models if they are predicting well  or not. Evaluating the model both on the training data and test data also lets us see  whether the model is overfitting or not: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf sess = tf.Session   x_vals = np.random.normal 1, 0.1, 100  y_vals = np.repeat 10., 100  x_data = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32  y_target = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32  batch_size = 25 train_indices = np.random.choice len x_vals , round len x_ vals *0.8 , replace=False  test_indices = np.array list set range len x_vals    - set train_ indices    x_vals_train = x_vals[train_indices] x_vals_test = x_vals[test_indices] y_vals_train = y_vals[train_indices] y_vals_test = y_vals[test_indices] A = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1,1]    56   2.  Now we declare our model, loss function, and optimization algorithm. We will also   initialize the model variable A. Use the following code: my_output = tf.matmul x_data, A  loss = tf.reduce_mean tf.square my_output - y_target   init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init  my_opt = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer 0.02  train_step = my_opt.minimize loss   3.  We run the training loop just as we would before, as follows:  for i in range 100 :     rand_index = np.random.choice len x_vals_train , size=batch_ size      rand_x = np.transpose [x_vals_train[rand_index]]      rand_y = np.transpose [y_vals_train[rand_index]]      sess.run train_step, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_target:  rand_y}      if  i+1 %25==0:         print 'Step ' + str i+1  + ' A = ' + str sess.run A            print 'Loss = ' + str sess.run loss, feed_dict={x_data:  rand_x, y_target: rand_y}    Step 25 A = [[ 6.39879179]] Loss = 13.7903 Step 50 A = [[ 8.64770794]] Loss = 2.53685 Step 75 A = [[ 9.40029907]] Loss = 0.818259 Step 100 A = [[ 9.6809473]] Loss = 1.10908  4.  Now, to evaluate the model, we will output the MSE  loss function  on the training   and test sets, as follows: mse_test = sess.run loss, feed_dict={x_data: np.transpose [x_vals_ test] , y_target: np.transpose [y_vals_test] }  mse_train = sess.run loss, feed_dict={x_data: np.transpose [x_ vals_train] , y_target: np.transpose [y_vals_train] }  print 'MSE' on test:' + str np.round mse_test, 2    print 'MSE' on train:' + str np.round mse_train, 2    MSE on test:1.35 MSE on train:0.88  57   6.   5.  For the classification example, we will do something very similar. This time, we will   need to create our own accuracy function that we can call at the end. One reason for  this is because our loss function has the sigmoid built in and we will need to call  the sigmoid separately and test it to see if our classes are correct. In the same script, we can just reload the graph and create our data, variables, and  placeholders. Remember that we will also need to separate the data and targets into  training and testing sets. Use the following code: from tensorflow.python.framework import ops ops.reset_default_graph   sess = tf.Session   batch_size = 25 x_vals = np.concatenate  np.random.normal -1, 1, 50 , np.random. normal 2, 1, 50    y_vals = np.concatenate  np.repeat 0., 50 , np.repeat 1., 50    x_data = tf.placeholder shape=[1, None], dtype=tf.float32  y_target = tf.placeholder shape=[1, None], dtype=tf.float32  train_indices = np.random.choice len x_vals , round len x_ vals *0.8 , replace=False  test_indices = np.array list set range len x_vals    - set train_ indices    x_vals_train = x_vals[train_indices] x_vals_test = x_vals[test_indices] y_vals_train = y_vals[train_indices] y_vals_test = y_vals[test_indices] A = tf.Variable tf.random_normal mean=10, shape=[1]    7.  We will now add the model and the loss function to the graph, initialize variables,   and create the optimization procedure, as follows: my_output = tf.add x_data, A  init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init  xentropy = tf.reduce_mean tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_ logits my_output, y_target   my_opt = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer 0.05  train_step = my_opt.minimize xentropy   8.  Now we run our training loop, as follows:  for i in range 1800 :     rand_index = np.random.choice len x_vals_train , size=batch_ size      rand_x = [x_vals_train[rand_index]]     rand_y = [y_vals_train[rand_index]]     sess.run train_step, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_target:  rand_y}   58       if  i+1 %200==0:         print 'Step ' + str i+1  + ' A = ' + str sess.run A            print 'Loss = ' + str sess.run xentropy, feed_dict={x_ data: rand_x, y_target: rand_y}    Step 200 A = [ 6.64970636] Loss = 3.39434 Step 400 A = [ 2.2884655] Loss = 0.456173 Step 600 A = [ 0.29109824] Loss = 0.312162 Step 800 A = [-0.20045301] Loss = 0.241349 Step 1000 A = [-0.33634067] Loss = 0.376786 Step 1200 A = [-0.36866501] Loss = 0.271654 Step 1400 A = [-0.3727718] Loss = 0.294866 Step 1600 A = [-0.39153299] Loss = 0.202275 Step 1800 A = [-0.36630616] Loss = 0.358463  9.  To evaluate the model, we will create our own prediction operation. We wrap the   prediction operation in a squeeze function because we want to make the predictions  and targets the same shape. Then we test for equality with the equal function. After  that, we are left with a tensor of true and false values that we cast to float32 and  take the mean of them. This will result in an accuracy value. We will evaluate this  function for both the training and testing sets, as follows: y_prediction = tf.squeeze tf.round tf.nn.sigmoid tf.add x_data,  A     correct_prediction = tf.equal y_prediction, y_target  accuracy = tf.reduce_mean tf.cast correct_prediction, tf.float32   acc_value_test = sess.run accuracy, feed_dict={x_data: [x_vals_ test], y_target: [y_vals_test]}  acc_value_train = sess.run accuracy, feed_dict={x_data: [x_vals_ train], y_target: [y_vals_train]}  print 'Accuracy' on train set: ' + str acc_value_train   print 'Accuracy' on test set: ' + str acc_value_test   Accuracy on train set: 0.925 Accuracy on test set: 0.95  59   10.  Many times, seeing the model results  accuracy, MSE, and so on  will help us to  evaluate the model. We can easily graph the model and data here because it is  one-dimensional. Here is how to visualize the model and data with two separate  histograms using matplotlib:  A_result = sess.run A  bins = np.linspace -5, 5, 50  plt.hist x_vals[0:50], bins, alpha=0.5, label='N' -1,1 ',  color='white'  plt.hist x_vals[50:100], bins[0:50], alpha=0.5, label='N' 2,1 ',  color='red'  plt.plot  A_result, A_result ,  0, 8 , 'k--', linewidth=3,  label='A = '+ str np.round A_result, 2    plt.legend loc='upper right'  plt.title 'Binary' Classifier, Accuracy=' + str np.round acc_ value, 2    plt.show    Figure 8: Visualization of data and the end model, A. The two normal values are centered at -1 and 2, making the   theoretical best split at 0.5. Here the model found the best split very close to that number.  60   Linear Regression  In this chapter, we will cover the basic recipes for understanding how TensorFlow works and  how to access data for this book and additional resources. We will cover the following areas:   f Using the Matrix Inverse Method  f Implementing a Decomposition Method  f Learning the TensorFlow Way of Regression  f Understanding Loss Functions in Linear Regression  f Implementing Deming Regression  f Implementing Lasso and Ridge Regression  f Implementing Elastic Net Regression  f Implementing Regression Logistic Regression  Introduction Linear regression may be one of the most important algorithms in statistics, machine  learning, and science in general. It's one of the most used algorithms and it is very important  to understand how to implement it and its various flavors. One of the advantages that linear  regression has over many other algorithms is that it is very interpretable. We end up with a  number for each feature that directly represents how that feature influences the target or  dependent variable. In this chapter, we will introduce how linear regression can be classically  implemented, and then move on to how to best implement it in TensorFlow. Remember  that all the code is available at GitHub online at https:  github.com nfmcclure  tensorflow_cookbook.  3  61   Using the Matrix Inverse Method In this recipe, we will use TensorFlow to solve two dimensional linear regressions with the  matrix inverse method.  Getting ready  Linear regression can be represented as a set of matrix equations, say  are interested in solving the coefficients in matrix x. We have to be careful if our observation  matrix  design matrix  A is not square. The solution to solving x can be expressed as   . Here we   . To show this is indeed the case, we will generate two-dimensional data,   solve it in TensorFlow, and plot the result.  How to do it…  1.  First we load the necessary libraries, initialize the graph, and create the data,    as follows: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf sess = tf.Session   x_vals = np.linspace 0, 10, 100  y_vals = x_vals + np.random.normal 0, 1, 100   2.  Next we create the matrices to use in the inverse method. We create the A matrix   first, which will be a column of x-data and a column of 1s. Then we create the b  matrix from the y-data. Use the following code: x_vals_column = np.transpose np.matrix x_vals   ones_column = np.transpose np.matrix np.repeat 1, 100    A = np.column_stack  x_vals_column, ones_column   b = np.transpose np.matrix y_vals    3.  We then turn our A and b matrices into tensors, as follows:  A_tensor = tf.constant A  b_tensor = tf.constant b   4.  Now that we have our matrices set up , we can use TensorFlow to solve this via the   matrix inverse method, as follows: tA_A = tf.matmul tf.transpose A_tensor , A_tensor  tA_A_inv = tf.matrix_inverse tA_A  product = tf.matmul tA_A_inv, tf.transpose A_tensor   solution = tf.matmul product, b_tensor  solution_eval = sess.run solution   62   5.  We now extract the coefficients from the solution, the slope and the y-intercept,    as follows: slope = solution_eval[0][0] y_intercept = solution_eval[1][0] print 'slope: ' + str slope   print 'y'_intercept: ' + str y_intercept    slope: 0.955707151739 y_intercept: 0.174366829314  best_fit = [] for i in x_vals:   best_fit.append slope*i+y_intercept  plt.plot x_vals, y_vals, 'o', label='Data'  plt.plot x_vals, best_fit, 'r-', label='Best' fit line',  linewidth=3  plt.legend loc='upper left'  plt.show    Figure 1: Data points and a best-fit line obtained via the matrix inverse method.  63   How it works… Unlike prior recipes, or most recipes in this book, the solution here is found exactly   through matrix operations. Most TensorFlow algorithms that we will use are implemented via  a training loop and take advantage of automatic back propagation to update model variables.  Here, we illustrate the versatility of TensorFlow by implementing a direct solution to fitting a  model to data.  Implementing a Decomposition Method For this recipe, we will implement a matrix decomposition method for linear regression.  Specifically we will use the Cholesky decomposition, for which relevant functions exist in  TensorFlow.  Getting ready Implementing inverse methods in the previous recipe can be numerically inefficient in most  cases, especially when the matrices get very large. Another approach is to decompose the  A matrix and perform matrix operations on the decompositions instead. One such approach  is to use the built-in Cholesky decomposition method in TensorFlow. One reason people are  so interested in decomposing a matrix into more matrices is because the resulting matrices  will have assured properties that allow us to use certain methods efficiently. The Cholesky  decomposition decomposes a matrix into a lower and upper triangular matrix, say   and  , such that these matrices are transpositions of each other. For further information on the  properties of this decomposition, there are many resources available that describe it and how  to arrive at it. Here we will solve the system,  solve    to arrive at our coefficient matrix, x.  , by writing it as    and then solve   . We will first   64   How to do it…  1.  We will set up the system exactly in the same way as the previous recipe. We will   import libraries, initialize the graph, and create the data. Then we will obtain our A  matrix and b matrix in the same way as before: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow.python.framework import ops ops.reset_default_graph   sess = tf.Session   x_vals = np.linspace 0, 10, 100  y_vals = x_vals + np.random.normal 0, 1, 100  x_vals_column = np.transpose np.matrix x_vals   ones_column = np.transpose np.matrix np.repeat 1, 100    A = np.column_stack  x_vals_column, ones_column   b = np.transpose np.matrix y_vals   A_tensor = tf.constant A  b_tensor = tf.constant b   2.  Next we will find the Cholesky decomposition of our square matrix,   :  Note that the TensorFlow function, cholesky  , only returns the  lower diagonal part of the decomposition. This is fine, as the upper  diagonal matrix is just the lower one, transposed.  tA_A = tf.matmul tf.transpose A_tensor , A_tensor  L = tf.cholesky tA_A  tA_b = tf.matmul tf.transpose A_tensor , b  sol1 = tf.matrix_solve L, tA_b  sol2 = tf.matrix_solve tf.transpose L , sol1   65   3.  Now that we have the solution, we extract the coefficients:  solution_eval = sess.run sol2  slope = solution_eval[0][0] y_intercept = solution_eval[1][0] print 'slope: ' + str slope   print 'y'_intercept: ' + str y_intercept    slope: 0.956117676145 y_intercept: 0.136575513864  best_fit = [] for i in x_vals:   best_fit.append slope*i+y_intercept  plt.plot x_vals, y_vals, 'o', label='Data'  plt.plot x_vals, best_fit, 'r-', label='Best' fit line',  linewidth=3  plt.legend loc='upper left'  plt.show    Figure 2: Data points and best-fit line obtained via Cholesky decomposition.  66   How it works… As you can see, we arrive at a very similar answer to the prior recipe. Keep in mind that this  way of decomposing a matrix, then performing our operations on the pieces, is sometimes  much more efficient and numerically stable.  Learning The TensorFlow Way of Linear  Regression  Getting ready In this recipe, we will loop through batches of data points and let TensorFlow update the slope  and y-intercept. Instead of generated data, we will us the iris dataset that is built in to the  Scikit Learn. Specifically, we will find an optimal line through data points where the x-value  is the petal width and the y-value is the sepal length. We choose these two because there  appears to be a linear relationship between them, as we will see in the graphs at the end. We  will also talk more about the effects of different loss functions in the next section, but for  this recipe we will use the L2 loss function.  How to do it…  1.  We start by loading the necessary libraries, creating a graph, and loading the data:  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf from sklearn import datasets from tensorflow.python.framework import ops ops.reset_default_graph   sess = tf.Session   iris = datasets.load_iris    x_vals = np.array [x[3] for x in iris.data]  y_vals = np.array [y[0] for y in iris.data]   2.  We then declare our learning rate, batch size, placeholders, and model variables:  learning_rate = 0.05 batch_size = 25 x_data = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32  y_target = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32  A = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1,1]   b = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1,1]    67   3.  Next, we write the formula for the linear model, y=Ax+b:  model_output = tf.add tf.matmul x_data, A , b   4.  Then we declare our L2 loss function  which includes the mean over the batch ,  initialize the variables, and declare our optimizer. Note that we chose 0.05 as our  learning rate: loss = tf.reduce_mean tf.square y_target - model_output   init = tf.global_variables_initializer   sess.run init  my_opt = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer learning_rate  train_step = my_opt.minimize loss   5.  We can now loop through and train the model on randomly selected batches. We will   run it for 100 loops and print out the variable and loss values every 25 iterations.  Note that here we are also saving the loss of every iteration so that we can view it  afterwards: loss_vec = [] for i in range 100 :     rand_index = np.random.choice len x_vals , size=batch_size      rand_x = np.transpose [x_vals[rand_index]]      rand_y = np.transpose [y_vals[rand_index]]      sess.run train_step, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_target:  rand_y}      temp_loss = sess.run loss, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_ target: rand_y}      loss_vec.append temp_loss      if  i+1 %25==0:         print 'Step ' + str i+1  + ' A = ' + str sess.run A   + '  b = ' + str sess.run b            print 'Loss = ''' + str temp_loss   Step 25 A = [[ 2.17270374]] b = [[ 2.85338426]] Loss = 1.08116 Step 50 A = [[ 1.70683455]] b = [[ 3.59916329]] Loss = 0.796941 Step 75 A = [[ 1.32762754]] b = [[ 4.08189011]] Loss = 0.466912 Step 100 A = [[ 1.15968263]] b = [[ 4.38497639]] Loss = 0.281003  68   6.  Next we will extract the coefficients we found and create a best-fit line to put in the   graph: [slope] = sess.run A  [y_intercept] = sess.run b  best_fit = [] for i in x_vals:   best_fit.append slope*i+y_intercept   7.  Here we will create two plots. The first will be the data with the found line overlaid.   The second is the L2 loss function over the 100 iterations: plt.plot x_vals, y_vals, 'o', label='Data Points'  plt.plot x_vals, best_fit, 'r-', label='Best' fit line',  linewidth=3  plt.legend loc='upper left'  plt.title 'Sepal' Length vs Pedal Width'  plt.xlabel 'Pedal Width'  plt.ylabel 'Sepal Length'  plt.show   plt.plot loss_vec, 'k-'  plt.title 'L2' Loss per Generation'  plt.xlabel 'Generation'  plt.ylabel 'L2 Loss'  plt.show    Figure 3: These are the data points from the iris dataset  sepal length versus pedal width     overlaid with the optimal line fit found in TensorFlow with the specified algorithm.  69   Figure 4: Here is the L2 loss of fitting the data with our algorithm. Note the jitter in the loss function; this can be   decreased with a larger batch size or increased with a smaller batch size.  Here is a good place to note how to see if the model is over-or underfitting  the data. If our data is broken into a test and train set, and the accuracy  is greater on the train set and going down on the test set, then we are  overfitting the data. If the accuracy is still increasing on both the test and  train set, then the model is underfitting and we should continue training.  How it works… The optimal line found is not guaranteed to be the best-fit line. Convergence to the best-fit  line depends on the number of iterations, batch size, learning rate, and the loss function. It  is always good practice to observe the loss function over time as it can help us troubleshoot  problems or hyperparameter changes.  Understanding Loss Functions in Linear  Regression It is important to know the effect of loss functions in algorithm convergence. Here we will  illustrate how the L1 and L2 loss functions affect convergence in linear regression.  70   Getting ready We will use the same iris dataset as in the prior recipe, but we will change our loss functions  and learning rates to see how convergence changes.  How to do it…  1.  The start of the program is unchanged from before until we get to our loss function.  We load the necessary libraries, start a session, load the data, create placeholders,  and define our variables and model. One thing to note is that we are pulling out our  learning rate and model iterations. We are doing this because we want to show the  effect of quickly changing these parameters. Use the following code: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf from sklearn import datasets sess = tf.Session   iris = datasets.load_iris   x_vals = np.array [x[3] for x in iris.data]  y_vals = np.array [y[0] for y in iris.data]  batch_size = 25 learning_rate = 0.1  Will not converge with learning rate at 0.4 iterations = 50 x_data = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32  y_target = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32  A = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1,1]   b = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1,1]   model_output = tf.add tf.matmul x_data, A , b   2.  Our loss function will change to the L1 loss, as follows:  loss_l1 = tf.reduce_mean tf.abs y_target - model_output    Note that we can change this back to the L2 loss by substituting  in the following formula: tf.reduce_mean tf.square y_ target – model_output  .  71   3.  Now we resume by initializing the variables declaring our optimizer, and looping them  through the training part. Note that we are also saving our loss at every generation  to measure the convergence. Use the following code: init = tf.global_variables_initializer   sess.run init  my_opt_l1 = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer learning_rate  train_step_l1 = my_opt_l1.minimize loss_l1  loss_vec_l1 = [] for i in range iterations :     rand_index = np.random.choice len x_vals , size=batch_size      rand_x = np.transpose [x_vals[rand_index]]      rand_y = np.transpose [y_vals[rand_index]]      sess.run train_step_l1, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_target:  rand_y}      temp_loss_l1 = sess.run loss_l1, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x,  y_target: rand_y}      loss_vec_l1.append temp_loss_l1      if  i+1 %25==0:         print 'Step ' + str i+1  + ' A = ' + str sess.run A   + '  b = ' + str sess.run b     plt.plot loss_vec_l1, 'k-', label='L1 Loss'  plt.plot loss_vec_l2, 'r--', label='L2 Loss'  plt.title 'L1' and L2 Loss per Generation'  plt.xlabel 'Generation'  plt.ylabel 'L1 Loss'  plt.legend loc='upper right'  plt.show    How it works… When choosing a loss function, we must also choose a corresponding learning rate that will  work with our problem. Here, we will illustrate two situations, one in which L2 is preferred and  one in which L1 is preferred.  If our learning rate is small, our convergence will take more time. But if our learning rate   is too large, we will have issues with our algorithm never converging. Here is a plot of the   loss function of the L1 and L2 loss for the iris linear regression problem when the learning  rate is 0.05:  72   Figure 5: Here is the L1 and L2 loss with a learning rate of 0.05 for the iris linear regression problem.  With a learning rate of 0.05, it would appear that L2 loss is preferred, as it converges to a  lower loss on the data. Here is a graph of the loss functions when we increase the learning  rate to 0.4:  Fihure 6: Shows the L1 and L2 loss on the iris linear regression problem with a learning rate of 0.4.    Note that the L1 loss is not visible because of the high scale of the y-axis.  73   Here, we can see that the large learning rate can overshoot in the L2 norm, whereas the L1  norm converges.  There's more… To understand what is happening, we should look at how a large learning rate and small  learning rate act on L1 and L2 norms. To visualize this, we look at a one-dimensional  representation of learning steps on both norms, as follows:  Figure 7: Illustrates what can happen with the L1 and L2 norm with larger and smaller learning rates.  Implementing Deming regression In this recipe, we will implement Deming regression  total regression , which means we will  need a different way to measure the distance between the model line and data points.  74   Getting ready If least squares linear regression minimizes the vertical distance to the line, Deming  regression minimizes the total distance to the line. This type of regression minimizes the error  in the y values and the x values. See the following figure for a comparison:  Figure 8: Here we illustrate the difference between regular linear regression and Deming regression. Linear   regression on the left minimizes the vertical distance to the line, and Deming regression minimizes the total distance   to the line.  To implement Deming regression, we have to modify the loss function. The loss function  in regular linear regression minimizes the vertical distance. Here, we want to minimize the  total distance. Given a slope and intercept of a line, the perpendicular distance to a point is  a known geometric formula. We just have to substitute this formula in and tell TensorFlow to  minimize it.  How to do it…  1.  Everything stays the same except when we get to the loss function. We begin by  loading the libraries, starting a session, loading the data, declaring the batch size,  creating the placeholders, variables, and model output, as follows: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf from sklearn import datasets sess = tf.Session   iris = datasets.load_iris   x_vals = np.array [x[3] for x in iris.data]   75   y_vals = np.array [y[0] for y in iris.data]  batch_size = 50 x_data = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32  y_target = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32  A = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1,1]   b = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1,1]   model_output = tf.add tf.matmul x_data, A , b   2.  The loss function is a geometric formula that comprises of a numerator and   denominator. For clarity we will write these out separately. Given a line, y=mx+b and  a point,  follows:  , the perpendicular distance between the two can be written as   demming_numerator = tf.abs tf.sub y_target, tf.add tf.matmul x_ data, A , b    demming_denominator = tf.sqrt tf.add tf.square A ,1   loss = tf.reduce_mean tf.truediv demming_numerator, demming_ denominator    3.  We now initialize our variables, declare our optimizer, and loop through the training   set to arrive at our parameters, as follows: init = tf.global_variables_initializer   sess.run init  my_opt = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer 0.1  train_step = my_opt.minimize loss  loss_vec = [] for i in range 250 :     rand_index = np.random.choice len x_vals , size=batch_size      rand_x = np.transpose [x_vals[rand_index]]      rand_y = np.transpose [y_vals[rand_index]]      sess.run train_step, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_target:  rand_y}      temp_loss = sess.run loss, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_ target: rand_y}      loss_vec.append temp_loss      if  i+1 %50==0:         print 'Step ''' + str i+1  + ' A = ' + str sess.run A   +  ' b = ' + str sess.run b            print 'Loss = ' + str temp_loss    76   4.  We can plot the output with the following code:  [slope] = sess.run A  [y_intercept] = sess.run b  best_fit = [] for i in x_vals:   best_fit.append slope*i+y_intercept  plt.plot x_vals, y_vals, 'o', label='Data Points'  plt.plot x_vals, best_fit, 'r-', label='Best' fit line',  linewidth=3  plt.legend loc='upper left'  plt.title 'Sepal' Length vs Pedal Width'  plt.xlabel 'Pedal Width'  plt.ylabel 'Sepal Length'  plt.show    Figure 9: The graph depicting the solution to Deming regression on the iris dataset.  How it works… The recipe here for Deming regression is almost identical to regular linear regression. The key  difference here is how we measure the loss between the predictions and the data points.  Instead of a vertical loss, we have a perpendicular loss  or total loss  with the y values  and x values.  77   Note that the type of Deming regression implemented here is called total  regression. Total regression is when we assume the error in the x and y values  are similar. We can also scale the x and y axes in the distance calculation by  the difference in the errors according to our beliefs.  Implementing Lasso and Ridge Regression There are also ways to limit the influence of coefficients on the regression output. These  methods are called regularization methods and two of the most common regularization  methods are lasso and ridge regression. We cover how to implement both of these in   this recipe.  Getting ready Lasso and ridge regression are very similar to regular linear regression, except we adding  regularization terms to limit the slopes  or partial slopes  in the formula. There may be  multiple reasons for this, but a common one is that we wish to restrict the features that have  an impact on the dependent variable. This can be accomplished by adding a term to the loss  function that depends on the value of our slope, A.  For lasso regression, we must add a term that greatly increases our loss function if the  slope, A, gets above a certain value. We could use TensorFlow's logical operations, but they do  not have a gradient associated with them. Instead, we will use a continuous approximation to  a step function, called the continuous heavy step function, that is scaled up and over to the  regularization cut off we choose. We will show how to do lasso regression shortly.  For ridge regression, we just add a term to the L2 norm, which is the scaled L2 norm of the  slope coefficient. This modification is simple and is shown in the There's more… section at the  end of this recipe.  How to do it…  1.  We will use the iris dataset again and set up our script the same way as before. We  first load the libraries, start a session, load the data, declare the batch size, create  the placeholders, variables, and model output as follows: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf from sklearn import datasets from tensorflow.python.framework import ops ops.reset_default_graph   sess = tf.Session    78   iris = datasets.load_iris   x_vals = np.array [x[3] for x in iris.data]  y_vals = np.array [y[0] for y in iris.data]  batch_size = 50 learning_rate = 0.001 x_data = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32  y_target = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32  A = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1,1]   b = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1,1]   model_output = tf.add tf.matmul x_data, A , b   2.  We add the loss function, which is a modified continuous heavyside step function.   We also set the cutoff for lasso regression at 0.9. This means that we want to restrict  the slope coefficient to be less than 0.9. Use the following code: lasso_param = tf.constant 0.9  heavyside_step = tf.truediv 1., tf.add 1., tf.exp tf.mul -100.,  tf.sub A, lasso_param      regularization_param = tf.mul heavyside_step, 99.  loss = tf.add tf.reduce_mean tf.square y_target - model_output  ,  regularization_param   3.  We now initialize our variables and declare our optimizer, as follows:  init = tf.global_variables_initializer   sess.run init  my_opt = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer learning_rate  train_step = my_opt.minimize loss   4.  We will run the training loop a fair bit longer because it can take a while to converge.   We can see that the slope coefficient is less than 0.9. Use the following code: loss_vec = [] for i in range 1500 :     rand_index = np.random.choice len x_vals , size=batch_size      rand_x = np.transpose [x_vals[rand_index]]      rand_y = np.transpose [y_vals[rand_index]]      sess.run train_step, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_target:  rand_y}      temp_loss = sess.run loss, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_ target: rand_y}      loss_vec.append temp_loss[0]      if  i+1 %300==0:         print 'Step ''' + str i+1  + ' A = ' + str sess.run A   +  ' b = ' + str sess.run b            print 'Loss = ' + str temp_loss   Step 300 A = [[ 0.82512331]] b = [[ 2.30319238]] Loss = [[ 6.84168959]]  79   Step 600 A = [[ 0.8200165]] b = [[ 3.45292258]] Loss = [[ 2.02759886]] Step 900 A = [[ 0.81428504]] b = [[ 4.08901262]] Loss = [[ 0.49081498]] Step 1200 A = [[ 0.80919558]] b = [[ 4.43668795]] Loss = [[ 0.40478843]] Step 1500 A = [[ 0.80433637]] b = [[ 4.6360755]] Loss = [[ 0.23839757]]  How it works… We implement lasso regression by adding a continuous heavyside step function to the loss  function of linear regression. Because of the steepness of the step function, we have to be  careful with the step size. Too big of a step size and it will not converge. For ridge regression,  see the necessary change in the next section.  There's' more… For ridge regression, we change the loss function to look like the following code:  ridge_param = tf.constant 1.  ridge_loss = tf.reduce_mean tf.square A   loss = tf.expand_dims tf.add tf.reduce_mean tf.square y_target -  model_output  , tf.mul ridge_param, ridge_loss  , 0   Implementing Elastic Net Regression Elastic net regression is a type of regression that combines lasso regression with ridge  regression by adding a L1 and L2 regularization term to the loss function.  Getting ready Implementing elastic net regression should be straightforward after the previous two recipes,  so we will implement this in multiple linear regression on the iris dataset, instead of sticking  to the two-dimensional data as before. We will use pedal length, pedal width, and sepal width  to predict sepal length.  80   How to do it…  1.  First we load the necessary libraries and initialize a graph, as follows:  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf from sklearn import datasets sess = tf.Session    2.  Now we will load the data. This time, each element of x data will be a list of three   values instead of one. Use the following code: iris = datasets.load_iris   x_vals = np.array [[x[1], x[2], x[3]] for x in iris.data]  y_vals = np.array [y[0] for y in iris.data]   3.  Next we declare the batch size, placeholders, variables, and model output. The only  difference here is that we change the size specifications of the x data placeholder to  take three values instead of one, as follows: batch_size = 50 learning_rate = 0.001 x_data = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 3], dtype=tf.float32  y_target = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32  A = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[3,1]   b = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1,1]   model_output = tf.add tf.matmul x_data, A , b   4.  For elastic net, the loss function has the L1 and L2 norms of the partial slopes. We   create these terms and then add them into the loss function, as follows: elastic_param1 = tf.constant 1.  elastic_param2 = tf.constant 1.  l1_a_loss = tf.reduce_mean tf.abs A   l2_a_loss = tf.reduce_mean tf.square A   e1_term = tf.mul elastic_param1, l1_a_loss  e2_term = tf.mul elastic_param2, l2_a_loss  loss = tf.expand_dims tf.add tf.add tf.reduce_mean tf.square y_ target - model_output  , e1_term , e2_term , 0   5.  Now we can initialize the variables, declare our optimizer, and run the training loop   and fit our coefficients, as follows: init = tf.global_variables_initializer   sess.run init  my_opt = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer learning_rate  train_step = my_opt.minimize loss  loss_vec = []  81   for i in range 1000 :     rand_index = np.random.choice len x_vals , size=batch_size      rand_x = x_vals[rand_index]     rand_y = np.transpose [y_vals[rand_index]]      sess.run train_step, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_target:  rand_y}      temp_loss = sess.run loss, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_ target: rand_y}      loss_vec.append temp_loss[0]      if  i+1 %250==0:         print 'Step ' + str i+1  + ' A = ' + str sess.run A   + '  b = ' + str sess.run b            print 'Loss = ' + str temp_loss    6.  Here is the output of the code:  Step 250 A = [[ 0.42095602]  [ 0.1055888 ]  [ 1.77064979]] b = [[ 1.76164341]] Loss = [ 2.87764359] Step 500 A = [[ 0.62762028]  [ 0.06065864]  [ 1.36294949]] b = [[ 1.87629771]] Loss = [ 1.8032167] Step 750 A = [[ 0.67953539]  [ 0.102514  ]  [ 1.06914485]] b = [[ 1.95604002]] Loss = [ 1.33256555] Step 1000 A = [[ 0.6777274 ]  [ 0.16535147]  [ 0.8403284 ]] b = [[ 2.02246833]] Loss = [ 1.21458709]  as follows: plt.plot loss_vec, 'k-'  plt.title 'Loss' per Generation'  plt.xlabel 'Generation'  plt.ylabel 'Loss'  plt.show    82  7.  Now we can observe the loss over the training iterations to be sure that it converged,    Figure 10: Elastic net regression loss plotted over the 1,000 training iterations  How it works… Elastic net regression is implemented here as well as multiple linear regression. We can see  that with these regularization terms in the loss function the convergence is slower than in  prior sections. Regularization is as simple as adding in the appropriate terms in the loss  functions.  Implementing Logistic Regression For this recipe, we will implement logistic regression to predict the probability of low birthweight.  Getting ready Logistic regression is a way to turn linear regression into a binary classification. This is  accomplished by transforming the linear output in a sigmoid function that scales the output  between zero and 1. The target is a zero or 1, which indicates whether or not a data point is  in one class or another. Since we are predicting a number between zero or 1, the prediction  is classified into class value 1''' if the prediction is above a specified cut off value and class 0  otherwise. For the purpose of this example, we will specify that cut off to be 0.5, which will  make the classification as simple as rounding the output.  83   The data we will use for this example will be the low birthweight data that is obtained through  the University of Massachusetts Amherst statistical dataset repository  https:  www. umass.edu statdata statdata  . We will be predicting low birthweight from several  other factors.  How to do it…  1.  We start by loading the libraries, including the request library, because we will access   the low birth weight data through a hyperlink. We will also initiate a session: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf import requests from sklearn import datasets from sklearn.preprocessing import normalize from tensorflow.python.framework import ops ops.reset_default_graph   sess = tf.Session    2.  Next we will load the data through the request module and specify which features we   want to use. We have to be specific because one feature is the actual birth weight  and we don't want to use this to predict if the birthweight is greater or less than a  specific amount. We also do not want to use the ID column as a predictor either: birthdata_url = 'https:  www.umass.edu statdata statdata data  lowbwt.dat' birth_file = requests.get birthdata_url  birth_data = birth_file.text.split '\r\n' [5:] birth_header = [x for x in birth_data[0].split  ''  if len x >=1] birth_data = [[float x  for x in y.split  ''  if len x >=1] for y  in birth_data[1:] if len y >=1] y_vals = np.array [x[1] for x in birth_data]  x_vals = np.array [x[2:9] for x in birth_data]   3.  First we split the dataset into test and train sets:  train_indices = np.random.choice len x_vals , round len x_ vals *0.8 , replace=False  test_indices = np.array list set range len x_vals    - set train_ indices    x_vals_train = x_vals[train_indices] x_vals_test = x_vals[test_indices] y_vals_train = y_vals[train_indices] y_vals_test = y_vals[test_indices]  84   4.  Logistic regression convergence works better when the features are scaled between   0 and 1  min-max scaling . So next we will scale each feature: def normalize_cols m :     col_max = m.max axis=0      col_min = m.min axis=0      return  m-col_min     col_max - col_min       x_vals_train = np.nan_to_num normalize_cols x_vals_train   x_vals_test = np.nan_to_num normalize_cols x_vals_test    Note that we split the dataset into train and test before we scaled  the dataset. This is an important distinction to make. We want to make  sure that the training set does not influence the test set at all. If we  scaled the whole set before splitting, then we cannot guarantee that they  don't influence each other.  5.  Next we declare the batch size, placeholders, variables, and the logistic model. We   do not wrap the output in a sigmoid because that operation is built into the loss  function: batch_size = 25 x_data = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 7], dtype=tf.float32  y_target = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32  A = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[7,1]   b = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1,1]   model_output = tf.add tf.matmul x_data, A , b   6.  Now we declare our loss function, which has the sigmoid function, initialize our   variables, and declare our optimizer function: loss = tf.reduce_mean tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_ logits model_output, y_target   init = tf.global_variables_initializer   sess.run init  my_opt = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer 0.01  train_step = my_opt.minimize loss   7.  Along with recording the loss function, we will also want to record the classification   accuracy on the training and test set. So we will create a prediction function that  returns the accuracy for any size batch: prediction = tf.round tf.sigmoid model_output   predictions_correct = tf.cast tf.equal prediction, y_target ,  tf.float32  accuracy = tf.reduce_mean predictions_correct   85   8.  Now we can start our training loop and recording the loss and accuracies:  loss_vec = [] train_acc = [] test_acc = [] for i in range 1500 :     rand_index = np.random.choice len x_vals_train , size=batch_ size      rand_x = x_vals_train[rand_index]     rand_y = np.transpose [y_vals_train[rand_index]]      sess.run train_step, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_target:  rand_y}      temp_loss = sess.run loss, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_ target: rand_y}      loss_vec.append temp_loss      temp_acc_train = sess.run accuracy, feed_dict={x_data: x_vals_ train, y_target: np.transpose [y_vals_train] }      train_acc.append temp_acc_train      temp_acc_test = sess.run accuracy, feed_dict={x_data: x_vals_ test, y_target: np.transpose [y_vals_test] }      test_acc.append temp_acc_test   9.  Here is the code to look at the plots of the loss and accuracies:  plt.plot loss_vec, 'k-'  plt.title 'Cross Entropy Loss per Generation'  plt.xlabel 'Generation'  plt.ylabel 'Cross' Entropy Loss'  plt.show   plt.plot train_acc, 'k-', label='Train Set Accuracy'  plt.plot test_acc, 'r--', label='Test Set Accuracy'  plt.title 'Train' and Test Accuracy'  plt.xlabel 'Generation'  plt.ylabel 'Accuracy'  plt.legend loc='lower right'  plt.show    86   How it works… Here is the loss over the iterations and train and test set accuracies. Since the dataset is  only 189 observations, the train and test accuracy plots will change owing to the random  splitting of the dataset:  Figure 11: Cross-entropy loss plotted over the course of 1,500 iterations  Figure 12: Test and train set accuracy plotted over 1,500 generations.  87    4  Support Vector  Machines  This chapter will cover some important recipes regarding how to use, implement, and evaluate  support vector machines  SVM  in TensorFlow. The following areas will be covered:   f Working with a Linear SVM  f Reduction to Linear Regression  f Working with Kernels in TensorFlow  f Implementing a Non-Linear SVM  f Implementing a Multi-Class SVM  Note that both the prior covered logistic regression and most  of the SVMs in this chapter are binary predictors. While logistic  regression tries to find any separating line that maximizes the  distance  probabilistically , SVMs also try to minimize the error  while maximizing the margin between classes. In general, if the  problem has a large number of features compared to training  examples, try logistic regression or a linear SVM. If the number of  training examples is larger, or the data is not linearly separable, a  SVM with a Gaussian kernel may be used.  Also remember that all the code for this chapter is available online at https:  github. com nfmcclure tensorflow_cookbook.  89   Introduction Support vector machines are a method of binary classification. The basic idea is to find a  linear separating line  or hyperplane  between the two classes. We first assume that the  binary class targets are -1 or 1, instead of the prior 0 or 1 targets. Since there may be many  lines that separate two classes, we define the best linear separator that maximizes the  distance between both classes.  Figure 1: Given two separable classes, 'o' and 'x', we wish to find the equation for the linear separator between the  two. The left shows that there are many lines that separate the two classes. The right shows the unique maximum   margin line. The margin width is given by 2 . This line is found by minimizing the L2 norm of A.  We can write such a hyperplane as follows:  Here, A is a vector of our partial slopes and x is a vector of inputs. The width of the maximum  margin can be shown to be two divided by the L2 norm of A. There are many proofs out there  of this fact, but for a geometric idea, solving the perpendicular distance from a 2D point to a  line may provide motivation for moving forward.  For linearly separable binary class data, to maximize the margin, we minimize the L2 norm of  A,   . We must also subject this minimum to the constraint:  The preceding constraint assures us that all the points from the corresponding classes are on  the same side of the separating line.  90   Since not all datasets are linearly separable, we can introduce a loss function for points that  cross the margin lines. For n data points, we introduce what is called the soft margin loss  function, as follows:  Note that the product   is always greater than 1 if the point is on the correct side of  the margin. This makes the left term of the loss function equal to zero, and the only influence  on the loss function is the size of the margin.  The preceding loss function will seek a linearly separable line, but will allow for points crossing  the margin line. This can be a hard or soft allowance, depending on the value of  values of   result  in the model acting more like a hard margin, while allowing data points to cross the margin, if  need be.   result in more emphasis on widening the margin, and smaller values of   . Larger   In this chapter, we will set up a soft margin SVM and show how to extend it to nonlinear cases  and multiple classes.  Working with a Linear SVM For this example, we will create a linear separator from the iris data set. We know from prior  chapters that the sepal length and petal width create a linear separable binary data set for  predicting if a flower is I. setosa or not.  Getting ready To implement a soft separable SVM in TensorFlow, we will implement the specific loss  function, as follows:  Here, A is the vector of partial slopes, b is the intercept,  actual class,  -1 or 1  and    is the soft separability regularization parameter.   is a vector of inputs,    is the   91   How to do it…  1.  We start by loading the necessary libraries. This will include the scikit learn dataset   library for access to the iris data set. Use the following code: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf from sklearn import datasets  To set up Scikit-learn for this exercise, we just need to type  $pip install –U scikit-learn. Note that it also  comes installed with Anaconda as well.  2.  Next we start a graph session and load the data as we need it. Remember that we  are loading the first and fourth variables in the iris dataset as they are the sepal  length and sepal width. We are loading the target variable, which will take on the  value 1 for I. setosa and -1 otherwise. Use the following code: sess = tf.Session    iris = datasets.load_iris   x_vals = np.array [[x[0], x[3]] for x in iris.data]  y_vals = np.array [1 if y==0 else -1 for y in iris.target]   3.  We should now split the dataset into train and test sets. We will evaluate the   accuracy on both the training and test sets. Since we know this data set is linearly  separable, we should expect to get one hundred percent accuracy on both sets. Use  the following code: train_indices = np.random.choice len x_vals , round len x_ vals *0.8 , replace=False  test_indices = np.array list set range len x_vals    - set train_ indices    x_vals_train = x_vals[train_indices] x_vals_test = x_vals[test_indices] y_vals_train = y_vals[train_indices] y_vals_test = y_vals[test_indices]  92   4.  Next we set our batch size, placeholders, and model variables. It is important to  mention that with this SVM algorithm, we want very large batch sizes to help with  convergence. We can imagine that with very small batch sizes, the maximum margin  line would jump around slightly. Ideally, we would also slowly decrease the learning  rate as well, but this will suffice for now. Also, the A variable will take on the shape  2x1 because we have two predictor variables, sepal length and pedal width. Use the  following code: batch_size = 100  x_data = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 2], dtype=tf.float32  y_target = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32   A = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[2,1]   b = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1,1]    5.  We now declare our model output. For correctly classified points, this will return   numbers that are greater than or equal to 1 if the target is I. setosa and less than or  equal to -1 otherwise. Use the following code: model_output = tf.sub tf.matmul x_data, A , b   6.  Next we will put together and declare the necessary components for the maximum   margin loss. First we will declare a function that will calculate the L2 norm of a vector.  Then we add the margin parameter,  add together the two terms. Use the following code: l2_norm = tf.reduce_sum tf.square A    . We then declare our classification loss and   alpha = tf.constant [0.1]   classification_term = tf.reduce_mean tf.maximum 0., tf.sub 1.,  tf.mul model_output, y_target      loss = tf.add classification _term, tf.mul alpha, l2_norm    7.  Now we declare our prediction and accuracy functions so that we can evaluate   the accuracy on both the training and test sets, as follows; prediction = tf.sign model_output  accuracy = tf.reduce_mean tf.cast tf.equal prediction, y_target ,  tf.float32    93   8.  Here we will declare our optimizer function and initialize our model variables, as   follows: my_opt = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer 0.01  train_step = my_opt.minimize loss   init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   9.  We now can start our training loop, keeping in mind that we want to record our loss   and training accuracy on both the training and test set, as follows: loss_vec = [] train_accuracy = [] test_accuracy = [] for i in range 500 :     rand_index = np.random.choice len x_vals_train , size=batch_ size      rand_x = x_vals_train[rand_index]     rand_y = np.transpose [y_vals_train[rand_index]]      sess.run train_step, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_target:  rand_y}           temp_loss = sess.run loss, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_ target: rand_y}      loss_vec.append temp_loss           train_acc_temp = sess.run accuracy, feed_dict={x_data: x_vals_ train, y_target: np.transpose [y_vals_train] }      train_accuracy.append train_acc_temp           test_acc_temp = sess.run accuracy, feed_dict={x_data: x_vals_ test, y_target: np.transpose [y_vals_test] }      test_accuracy.append test_acc_temp           if  i+1 %100==0:         print 'Step ' + str i+1  + ' A = ' + str sess.run A   + '  b = ' + str sess.run b            print 'Loss = ' + str temp_loss    10.  The output of the script during training should look like the following.  Step 100 A = [[-0.10763293]  [-0.65735245]] b = [[-0.68752676]] Loss = [ 0.48756418] Step 200 A = [[-0.0650763 ]  [-0.89443302]] b = [[-0.73912662]] Loss = [ 0.38910741]  94   11.  In order to plot the outputs, we have to extract the coefficients and separate the x   Step 300 A = [[-0.02090022]  [-1.12334013]] b = [[-0.79332656]] Loss = [ 0.28621092] Step 400 A = [[ 0.03189624]  [-1.34912157]] b = [[-0.8507266]] Loss = [ 0.22397576] Step 500 A = [[ 0.05958777]  [-1.55989814]] b = [[-0.9000265]] Loss = [ 0.20492229]  values into I. setosa and non- I. setosa, as follows: [[a1], [a2]] = sess.run A  [[b]] = sess.run b  slope = -a2 a1 y_intercept = b a1  x1_vals = [d[1] for d in x_vals]  best_fit = [] for i in x1_vals:   best_fit.append slope*i+y_intercept   setosa_x = [d[1] for i,d in enumerate x_vals  if y_vals[i]==1] setosa_y = [d[0] for i,d in enumerate x_vals  if y_vals[i]==1] not_setosa_x = [d[1] for i,d in enumerate x_vals  if y_ vals[i]==-1] not_setosa_y = [d[0] for i,d in enumerate x_vals  if y_ vals[i]==-1]  12. The following is the code to plot the data with the linear separator, accuracies,    and loss: plt.plot setosa_x, setosa_y, 'o', label='I. setosa'  plt.plot not_setosa_x, not_setosa_y, 'x', label='Non-setosa'  plt.plot x1_vals, best_fit, 'r-', label='Linear Separator',  linewidth=3  plt.ylim [0, 10]  plt.legend loc='lower right'  plt.title 'Sepal Length vs Pedal Width'  plt.xlabel 'Pedal Width'  plt.ylabel 'Sepal Length'  plt.show    plt.plot train_accuracy, 'k-', label='Training Accuracy'   95   plt.plot test_accuracy, 'r--', label='Test Accuracy'  plt.title 'Train and Test Set Accuracies'  plt.xlabel 'Generation'  plt.ylabel 'Accuracy'  plt.legend loc='lower right'  plt.show    plt.plot loss_vec, 'k-'  plt.title 'Loss per Generation'  plt.xlabel 'Generation'  plt.ylabel 'Loss'  plt.show    Using TensorFlow in this manner to implement the SVD  algorithm may result in slightly different outcomes each run.  The reasons for this include the random train test set splitting  and the selection of different batches of points on each training  batch. Also it would be ideal to also slowly lower the learning  rate after each generation.  Figure 2: Final linear SVM fit with the two classes plotted.  96   Final linear SVM fit with the two classes plotted:  Figure 3: Test and train set accuracy over iterations. We do get 100% accuracy    because the two classes are linearly separable.  Test and train set accuracy over iterations. We do get 100% accuracy because the two classes  are linearly separable:  Figure 4: Plot of the maximum margin loss over 500 iterations.  How it works… In this recipe, we have shown that implementing a linear SVD model is possible by using the  maximum margin loss function.  97   Reduction to Linear Regression Support vector machines can be used to fit linear regression. In this chapter, we will explore  how to do this with TensorFlow.  Getting ready The same maximum margin concept can be applied toward fitting linear regression. Instead of  maximizing the margin that separates the classes, we can think about maximizing the margin  that contains the most  x, y  points. To illustrate this, we will use the same iris data set, and  show that we can use this concept to fit a line between sepal length and petal width.  The corresponding loss function will be similar to max  the width of the margin, which makes the loss equal to zero if a point lies in this region.  . Here,    is half of   How to do it…  1.  First we load the necessary libraries, start a graph, and load the iris dataset. After   that, we will split the dataset into train and test sets to visualize the loss on both.  Use the following code: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf from sklearn import datasets sess = tf.Session   iris = datasets.load_iris   x_vals = np.array [x[3] for x in iris.data]  y_vals = np.array [y[0] for y in iris.data]  train_indices = np.random.choice len x_vals , round len x_ vals *0.8 , replace=False  test_indices = np.array list set range len x_vals    - set train_ indices    x_vals_train = x_vals[train_indices] x_vals_test = x_vals[test_indices] y_vals_train = y_vals[train_indices] y_vals_test = y_vals[test_indices]  For this example, we have split the data into train and test. It is also  common to split the data into three datasets, which includes the  validation set. We can use this validation set to verify that we are  not overfitting models as we train them.  98   2.  Let's declare our batch size, placeholders, and variables, and create our linear model,    as follows: batch_size = 50  x_data = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32  y_target = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32   A = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1,1]   b = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1,1]    model_output = tf.add tf.matmul x_data, A , b   3.  Now we declare our loss function. The loss function, as described in the preceding   text, is implemented to follow with  loss function, which allows for a soft margin instead of a hard margin. epsilon = tf.constant [0.5]  loss = tf.reduce_mean tf.maximum 0., tf.sub tf.abs tf.sub model_ output, y_target  , epsilon     . Remember that the epsilon is part of our   4.  We create an optimizer and initialize our variables next, as follows:  my_opt = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer 0.075  train_step = my_opt.minimize loss   init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   5.  Now we iterate through 200 training iterations and save the training and test loss for   plotting later: train_loss = [] test_loss = [] for i in range 200 :     rand_index = np.random.choice len x_vals_train , size=batch_ size      rand_x = np.transpose [x_vals_train[rand_index]]      rand_y = np.transpose [y_vals_train[rand_index]]      sess.run train_step, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_target:  rand_y}           temp_train_loss = sess.run loss, feed_dict={x_data:  np.transpose [x_vals_train] , y_target: np.transpose [y_vals_ train] }      train_loss.append temp_train_loss        99       temp_test_loss = sess.run loss, feed_dict={x_data:  np.transpose [x_vals_test] , y_target: np.transpose [y_vals_ test] }      test_loss.append temp_test_loss      if  i+1 %50==0:         print '-----------'          print 'Generation: ' + str i           print 'A = ' + str sess.run A   + ' b = ' + str sess. run b            print 'Train Loss = ' + str temp_train_loss           print 'Test Loss = ' + str temp_test_loss    6.  This results in the following output:  Generation: 50 A = [[ 2.20651722]] b = [[ 2.71290684]] Train Loss = 0.609453 Test Loss = 0.460152 ----------- Generation: 100 A = [[ 1.6440177]] b = [[ 3.75240564]] Train Loss = 0.242519 Test Loss = 0.208901 ----------- Generation: 150 A = [[ 1.27711761]] b = [[ 4.3149066]] Train Loss = 0.108192 Test Loss = 0.119284 ----------- Generation: 200 A = [[ 1.05271816]] b = [[ 4.53690529]] Train Loss = 0.0799957 Test Loss = 0.107551  7.  We can now extract the coefficients we found, and get values for the best-fit line.    For plotting purposes, we will also get values for the margins as well. Use the  following code: [[slope]] = sess.run A  [[y_intercept]] = sess.run b  [width] = sess.run epsilon   best_fit = [] best_fit_upper = [] best_fit_lower = [] for i in x_vals:  100     best_fit.append slope*i+y_intercept    best_fit_upper.append slope*i+y_intercept+width    best_fit_lower.append slope*i+y_intercept-width   8.  Finally, here is the code to plot the data with the fitted line and the train-test loss:  plt.plot x_vals, y_vals, 'o', label='Data Points'  plt.plot x_vals, best_fit, 'r-', label='SVM Regression Line',  linewidth=3  plt.plot x_vals, best_fit_upper, 'r--', linewidth=2  plt.plot x_vals, best_fit_lower, 'r--', linewidth=2  plt.ylim [0, 10]  plt.legend loc='lower right'  plt.title 'Sepal Length vs Pedal Width'  plt.xlabel 'Pedal Width'  plt.ylabel 'Sepal Length'  plt.show   plt.plot train_loss, 'k-', label='Train Set Loss'  plt.plot test_loss, 'r--', label='Test Set Loss'  plt.title 'L2 Loss per Generation'  plt.xlabel 'Generation'  plt.ylabel 'L2 Loss'  plt.legend loc='upper right'  plt.show    Figure 5: SVM regression with a 0.5 margin on the iris data  sepal length versus petal width .  101   Here is the train and test loss over the training iterations:  Figure 6: SVM regression loss per generation on both the train and test sets.  How it works… Intuitively, we can think of SVM regression as a function that is trying to fit as many points in  the  to this parameter. If we choose too small an epsilon, the algorithm will not be able to fit many  points in the margin. If we choose too large of an epsilon, there will be many lines that are  able to fit all the data points in the margin. We prefer a smaller epsilon, since nearer points to  the margin contribute less loss than further away points.   width margin from the line as possible. The fitting of this line is somewhat sensitive   Working with Kernels in TensorFlow The prior SVMs worked with linear separable data. If we would like to separate non-linear  data, we can change how we project the linear separator onto the data. This is done by  changing the kernel in the SVM loss function. In this chapter, we introduce how to changer  kernels and separate non-linear separable data.  102   Getting ready In this recipe, we will motivate the usage of kernels in support vector machines. In the linear  SVM section, we solved the soft margin with a specific loss function. A different approach to  this method is to solve what is called the dual of the optimization problem. It can be shown  that the dual for the linear SVM problem is given by the following formula:  Where:  Here, the variable in the model will be the b vector. Ideally, this vector will be quite sparse,  only taking on values near 1 and -1 for the corresponding support vectors of our dataset. Our  data point vectors are indicated by    and our targets  1 or -1  are represented by   .  The kernel in the preceding equations is the dot product,  kernel. This kernel is a square matrix filled with the   , which gives us the linear    dot products of the data points.  Instead of just doing the dot product between data points, we can expand them with   more complicated functions into higher dimensions, in which the classes may be linear  separable. This may seem needlessly complicated, but if we select a function, k, that has   the property where:  then k is called a kernel function. This is one of the more common kernels if the Gaussian  kernel  also known as the radian basis function kernel or the RBF kernel  is used. This kernel  is described with the following equation:  In order to make predictions on this kernel, say at a point  prediction point in the appropriate equation in the kernel as follows:  , we just substitute in the   103   In this section, we will discuss how to implement the Gaussian kernel. We will also make a  note of where to make the substitution for implementing the linear kernel where appropriate.  The dataset we will use will be manually created to show where the Gaussian kernel would   be more appropriate to use over the linear kernel.  How to do it…  1.  First we load the necessary libraries and start a graph session, as follows:  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf from sklearn import datasets sess = tf.Session    2.  Now we generate the data. The data we will generate will be two concentric rings of   data, each ring will belong to a different class. We have to make sure that the classes  are -1 or 1 only . Then we will split the data into x and y values for each class for  plotting purposes. Use the following code:  x_vals, y_vals  = datasets.make_circles n_samples=500, factor=.5,  noise=.1  y_vals = np.array [1 if y==1 else -1 for y in y_vals]  class1_x = [x[0] for i,x in enumerate x_vals  if y_vals[i]==1] class1_y = [x[1] for i,x in enumerate x_vals  if y_vals[i]==1] class2_x = [x[0] for i,x in enumerate x_vals  if y_vals[i]==-1] class2_y = [x[1] for i,x in enumerate x_vals  if y_vals[i]==-1]  3.  Next we declare our batch size, placeholders, and create our model variable, b. For  SVMs we tend to want larger batch sizes because we want a very stable model that  won't fluctuate much with each training generation. Also note that we have an extra  placeholder for the prediction points. To visualize the results, we will create a color  grid to see which areas belong to which class at the end. Use the following code: batch_size = 250 x_data = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 2], dtype=tf.float32  y_target = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32  prediction_grid = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 2], dtype=tf. float32  b = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1,batch_size]    4.  We will now create the Gaussian kernel. This kernel can be expressed as matrix   operations as follows: gamma = tf.constant -50.0  dist = tf.reduce_sum tf.square x_data , 1  dist = tf.reshape dist, [-1,1]   104   sq_dists = tf.add tf.sub dist, tf.mul 2., tf.matmul x_data,  tf.transpose x_data    , tf.transpose dist   my_kernel = tf.exp tf.mul gamma, tf.abs sq_dists      Note the usage of broadcasting in the sq_dists line of the add  and subtract operations. Note that the linear kernel can be expressed as my_kernel =  tf.matmul x_data, tf.transpose x_data  .  5.  Now we declare the dual problem as previously stated in this recipe. At the end,   instead of maximizing, we will be minimizing the negative of the loss function with a  tf.neg   function. Use the following code: model_output = tf.matmul b, my_kernel  first_term = tf.reduce_sum b  b_vec_cross = tf.matmul tf.transpose b , b  y_target_cross = tf.matmul y_target, tf.transpose y_target   second_term = tf.reduce_sum tf.mul my_kernel, tf.mul b_vec_cross,  y_target_cross    loss = tf.neg tf.sub first_term, second_term     6.  We now create the prediction and accuracy functions. First, we must create a   prediction kernel, similar to step 4, but instead of a kernel of the points with itself, we  have the kernel of the points with the prediction data. The prediction is then the sign  of the output of the model. Use the following code: rA = tf.reshape tf.reduce_sum tf.square x_data , 1 ,[-1,1]  rB = tf.reshape tf.reduce_sum tf.square prediction_grid , 1 ,[- 1,1]  pred_sq_dist = tf.add tf.sub rA, tf.mul 2., tf.matmul x_data,  tf.transpose prediction_grid    , tf.transpose rB   pred_kernel = tf.exp tf.mul gamma, tf.abs pred_sq_dist     prediction_output = tf.matmul tf.mul tf.transpose y_target ,b ,  pred_kernel  prediction = tf.sign prediction_output-tf.reduce_mean prediction_ output   accuracy = tf.reduce_mean tf.cast tf.equal tf.squeeze prediction ,  tf.squeeze y_target  , tf.float32    To implement the linear prediction kernel, we can  write pred_kernel = tf.matmul x_data,  tf.transpose prediction_grid  .  105   7.  Now we can create an optimizer function and initialize all the variables, as follows:  my_opt = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer 0.001  train_step = my_opt.minimize loss  init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   8.  Next we start the training loop. We will record the loss vector and the batch    accuracy for each generation. When we run the accuracy, we have to put in all   three placeholders, but we feed in the x data twice to get the prediction on the  points. Use the following code: loss_vec = [] batch_accuracy = [] for i in range 500 :     rand_index = np.random.choice len x_vals , size=batch_size      rand_x = x_vals[rand_index]     rand_y = np.transpose [y_vals[rand_index]]      sess.run train_step, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_target:  rand_y}           temp_loss = sess.run loss, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_ target: rand_y}      loss_vec.append temp_loss           acc_temp = sess.run accuracy, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x,                                              y_target: rand_y,                                              prediction_ grid:rand_x}      batch_accuracy.append acc_temp           if  i+1 %100==0:         print 'Step ' + str i+1           print 'Loss = ' + str temp_loss    9.  This results in the following output:  Step 100 Loss = -28.0772 Step 200 Loss = -3.3628 Step 300 Loss = -58.862 Step 400 Loss = -75.1121 Step 500 Loss = -84.8905  106   10.  In order to see the output class on the whole space, we will create a mesh of   prediction points in our system and run the prediction on all of them, as follows: x_min, x_max = x_vals[:, 0].min   - 1, x_vals[:, 0].max   + 1 y_min, y_max = x_vals[:, 1].min   - 1, x_vals[:, 1].max   + 1 xx, yy = np.meshgrid np.arange x_min, x_max, 0.02 ,                      np.arange y_min, y_max, 0.02   grid_points = np.c_[xx.ravel  , yy.ravel  ] [grid_predictions] = sess.run prediction, feed_dict={x_data:  rand_x,                                                    y_target:  rand_y,                                                    prediction_ grid: grid_points}  grid_predictions = grid_predictions.reshape xx.shape   11.  The following is the code to plot the result, batch accuracy, and loss:  plt.contourf xx, yy, grid_predictions, cmap=plt.cm.Paired,  alpha=0.8  plt.plot class1_x, class1_y, 'ro', label='Class 1'  plt.plot class2_x, class2_y, 'kx', label='Class -1'  plt.legend loc='lower right'  plt.ylim [-1.5, 1.5]  plt.xlim [-1.5, 1.5]  plt.show    plt.plot batch_accuracy, 'k-', label='Accuracy'  plt.title 'Batch Accuracy'  plt.xlabel 'Generation'  plt.ylabel 'Accuracy'  plt.legend loc='lower right'  plt.show    plt.plot loss_vec, 'k-'  plt.title 'Loss per Generation'  plt.xlabel 'Generation'  plt.ylabel 'Loss'  plt.show    107   12. For succinctness, we will show only the results graph, but we can also separately run   the plotting code and see all three if we so choose:  Figure 7: Linear SVM on non-linear separable data.  Linear SVM on non-linear separable data.  Figure 8: Non-linear SVM with Gaussian kernel results on nonlinear ring data.  Non-linear SVM with Gaussian kernel results on nonlinear ring data.  108   How it works… There are two important pieces of the code to know about: how we implemented the kernel  and how we implemented the loss function for the SVM dual optimization problem. We have  shown how to implement the linear and Gaussian kernel and that the Gaussian kernel can  separate nonlinear datasets.  We should also mention that there is another parameter, the gamma value in the Gaussian  kernel. This parameter controls how much influence points have on the curvature of the  separation. Small values are commonly chosen, but it depends heavily on the dataset. Ideally  this parameter is chosen with statistical techniques such as cross-validation.  There's more… There are many more kernels that we could implement if we so choose. Here is a list of a few  more common nonlinear kernels:   f Polynomial homogeneous kernel:   f Polynomial inhomogeneous kernel:   f Hyperbolic tangent kernel:  Implementing a Non-Linear SVM For this recipe, we will apply a non-linear kernel to split a dataset.  Getting ready In this section, we will implement the preceding Gaussian kernel SVM on real data. We will  load the iris data set and create a classifier for I. setosa  versus non-setosa . We will see the  effect of various gamma values on the classification.  109   How to do it…  1.  We first load the necessary libraries, which includes the scikit learn datasets so that  we can load the iris data. Then we will start a graph session. Use the following code: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf from sklearn import datasets sess = tf.Session    2.  Next we will load the iris data, extract the sepal length and petal width, and separated   the x and y values for each class  for plotting purposes later  , as follows: iris = datasets.load_iris   x_vals = np.array [[x[0], x[3]] for x in iris.data]  y_vals = np.array [1 if y==0 else -1 for y in iris.target]  class1_x = [x[0] for i,x in enumerate x_vals  if y_vals[i]==1] class1_y = [x[1] for i,x in enumerate x_vals  if y_vals[i]==1] class2_x = [x[0] for i,x in enumerate x_vals  if y_vals[i]==-1] class2_y = [x[1] for i,x in enumerate x_vals  if y_vals[i]==-1]  3.  Now we declare our batch size  larger batches are preferred , placeholders, and the   model variable, b, as follows: batch_size = 100  x_data = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 2], dtype=tf.float32  y_target = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32  prediction_grid = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 2], dtype=tf. float32   b = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1,batch_size]    4.  Next we declare our Gaussian kernel. This kernel is dependent on the gamma value,  and we will illustrate the effects of various gamma values on the classification later in  this recipe. Use the following code: gamma = tf.constant -10.0  dist = tf.reduce_sum tf.square x_data , 1  dist = tf.reshape dist, [-1,1]  sq_dists = tf.add tf.sub dist, tf.mul 2., tf.matmul x_data,  tf.transpose x_data    , tf.transpose dist   my_kernel = tf.exp tf.mul gamma, tf.abs sq_dists    We now compute the loss for the dual optimization problem, as  follows:  110   model_output = tf.matmul b, my_kernel  first_term = tf.reduce_sum b  b_vec_cross = tf.matmul tf.transpose b , b  y_target_cross = tf.matmul y_target, tf.transpose y_target   second_term = tf.reduce_sum tf.mul my_kernel, tf.mul b_vec_cross,  y_target_cross    loss = tf.neg tf.sub first_term, second_term    5.   In order to perform predictions using an SVM, we must create a prediction kernel  function. After that we also declare an accuracy calculation, which will just be a  percentage of points correctly classified. Use the following code: rA = tf.reshape tf.reduce_sum tf.square x_data , 1 ,[-1,1]  rB = tf.reshape tf.reduce_sum tf.square prediction_grid , 1 ,[- 1,1]  pred_sq_dist = tf.add tf.sub rA, tf.mul 2., tf.matmul x_data,  tf.transpose prediction_grid    , tf.transpose rB   pred_kernel = tf.exp tf.mul gamma, tf.abs pred_sq_dist     prediction_output = tf.matmul tf.mul tf.transpose y_target ,b ,  pred_kernel  prediction = tf.sign prediction_output-tf.reduce_mean prediction_ output   accuracy = tf.reduce_mean tf.cast tf.equal tf.squeeze prediction ,  tf.squeeze y_target  , tf.float32    6.  Next we declare our optimizer function and initialize the variables, as follows:  my_opt = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer 0.01  train_step = my_opt.minimize loss  init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   7.  Now we can start the training loop. We run the loop for 300 iterations and will store   the loss value and the batch accuracy. Use the following code: loss_vec = [] batch_accuracy = [] for i in range 300 :     rand_index = np.random.choice len x_vals , size=batch_size      rand_x = x_vals[rand_index]     rand_y = np.transpose [y_vals[rand_index]]      sess.run train_step, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_target:  rand_y}           temp_loss = sess.run loss, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_ target: rand_y}   111       loss_vec.append temp_loss           acc_temp = sess.run accuracy, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x,                                              y_target: rand_y,                                              prediction_ grid:rand_x}      batch_accuracy.append acc_temp   8.   In order to plot the decision boundary, we will create a mesh of x, y points and  evaluate the prediction function we created on all of these points, as follows: x_min, x_max = x_vals[:, 0].min   - 1, x_vals[:, 0].max   + 1 y_min, y_max = x_vals[:, 1].min   - 1, x_vals[:, 1].max   + 1 xx, yy = np.meshgrid np.arange x_min, x_max, 0.02 ,                      np.arange y_min, y_max, 0.02   grid_points = np.c_[xx.ravel  , yy.ravel  ] [grid_predictions] = sess.run prediction, feed_dict={x_data:  rand_x,                                                    y_target:  rand_y,                                                    prediction_ grid: grid_points}  grid_predictions = grid_predictions.reshape xx.shape   9.  For succinctness, we will only show how to plot the points with the decision   boundaries. For the plot and effect of gamma, see the next section in this recipe. Use  the following code: plt.contourf xx, yy, grid_predictions, cmap=plt.cm.Paired,  alpha=0.8  plt.plot class1_x, class1_y, 'ro', label='I. setosa'  plt.plot class2_x, class2_y, 'kx', label='Non setosa'  plt.title 'Gaussian SVM Results on Iris Data'  plt.xlabel 'Pedal Length'  plt.ylabel 'Sepal Width'  plt.legend loc='lower right'  plt.ylim [-0.5, 3.0]  plt.xlim [3.5, 8.5]  plt.show    112   How it works… Here is the classification of I. setosa results for four different gamma values  1, 10, 25, 100 .  Notice how the higher the gamma value, the more of an effect each individual point has on  the classification boundary.  Figure 9: Classification results of I. setosa using a Gaussian kernel SVM with four different values of gamma.  Implementing a Multi-Class SVM We can also use SVMs to categorize multiple classes instead of just two.  In this recipe, we will  use a multi-class SVM to categorize the three types of flowers in the iris dataset.  Getting ready By design, SVM algorithms are binary classifiers. However, there are a few strategies employed  to get them to work on multiple classes. The two main strategies are called one versus all, and  one versus one.  113   One versus one is a strategy where a binary classifier is created for each possible pair of  classes. Then a prediction is made for a point for the class that has the most votes. This can  be computationally hard as we must create    classifiers for k classes.  Another way to implement multi-class classifiers is to do a one versus all strategy where we  create a classifier for each of the  classes. The predicted class of a point will be the class that  creates the largest SVM margin. This is the strategy we will implement in this section.  Here, we will load the iris dataset and perform multiclass nonlinear SVM with a Gaussian  kernel. The iris dataset is ideal because there are three classes  I. setosa, I. virginica, and   I. versicolor . We will create three Gaussian kernel SVMs for each class and make the  prediction of points where the highest margin exists.  How to do it…  1.  First we load the libraries we need and start a graph, as follows:  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf from sklearn import datasets sess = tf.Session    2.  Next, we will load the iris dataset and split apart the targets for each class. We   will only be using the sepal length and petal width to illustrate because we want to  be able to plot the outputs. We also separate the x and y values for each class for  plotting purposes at the end. Use the following code: iris = datasets.load_iris   x_vals = np.array [[x[0], x[3]] for x in iris.data]  y_vals1 = np.array [1 if y==0 else -1 for y in iris.target]  y_vals2 = np.array [1 if y==1 else -1 for y in iris.target]  y_vals3 = np.array [1 if y==2 else -1 for y in iris.target]  y_vals = np.array [y_vals1, y_vals2, y_vals3]  class1_x = [x[0] for i,x in enumerate x_vals  if iris. target[i]==0] class1_y = [x[1] for i,x in enumerate x_vals  if iris. target[i]==0] class2_x = [x[0] for i,x in enumerate x_vals  if iris. target[i]==1] class2_y = [x[1] for i,x in enumerate x_vals  if iris. target[i]==1] class3_x = [x[0] for i,x in enumerate x_vals  if iris. target[i]==2] class3_y = [x[1] for i,x in enumerate x_vals  if iris. target[i]==2]  114   3.  The biggest change we have in this example, as compared to the Implementing a  Non-Linear SVM recipe, is that a lot of the dimensions will change  we have three  classifiers now instead of one . We will also make use of matrix broadcasting and  reshaping techniques to calculate all three SVMs at once. Since we are doing this all at  once, our y_target placeholder now has the dimensions [3, None] and our model  variable, b, will be initialized to be size [3, batch_size]. Use the following code: batch_size = 50  x_data = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 2], dtype=tf.float32  y_target = tf.placeholder shape=[3, None], dtype=tf.float32  prediction_grid = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 2], dtype=tf. float32   b = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[3,batch_size]    4.  Next we calculate the Gaussian kernel. Since this is only dependent on the x data,   this code doesn't change from the prior recipe. Use the following code: gamma = tf.constant -10.0  dist = tf.reduce_sum tf.square x_data , 1  dist = tf.reshape dist, [-1,1]  sq_dists = tf.add tf.sub dist, tf.mul 2., tf.matmul x_data,  tf.transpose x_data    , tf.transpose dist   my_kernel = tf.exp tf.mul gamma, tf.abs sq_dists     5.  One big change is that we will do batch matrix multiplication. We will end up with    to work across an extra dimension, we create a   three-dimensional matrices and we will want to broadcast matrix multiplication  across the third index. Our data and target matrices are not set up for this. In order  for an operation such as  function to expand such matrices, reshape the matrix into a transpose, and then call  TensorFlow's batch_matmul across the extra dimension. Use the following code: def reshape_matmul mat :     v1 = tf.expand_dims mat, 1      v2 = tf.reshape v1, [3, batch_size, 1]      return tf.batch_matmul v2, v1    6.  With this function created, we can now compute the dual loss function, as follows:  model_output = tf.matmul b, my_kernel  first_term = tf.reduce_sum b  b_vec_cross = tf.matmul tf.transpose b , b  y_target_cross = reshape_matmul y_target   second_term = tf.reduce_sum tf.mul my_kernel, tf.mul b_vec_cross,  y_target_cross  ,[1,2]  loss = tf.reduce_sum tf.neg tf.sub first_term, second_term     115   7.  Now we can create the prediction kernel. Notice that we have to be careful with the  reduce_sum function and not reduce across all three SVM predictions, so we have  to tell TensorFlow not to sum everything up with a second index argument. Use the  following code: rA = tf.reshape tf.reduce_sum tf.square x_data , 1 ,[-1,1]  rB = tf.reshape tf.reduce_sum tf.square prediction_grid , 1 ,[- 1,1]  pred_sq_dist = tf.add tf.sub rA, tf.mul 2., tf.matmul x_data,  tf.transpose prediction_grid    , tf.transpose rB   pred_kernel = tf.exp tf.mul gamma, tf.abs pred_sq_dist     8.  When we are done with the prediction kernel, we can create predictions. A big   change here is that the predictions are not the sign   of the output. Since we are  implementing a one versus all strategy, the prediction is the classifier that has the  largest output. To accomplish this, we use TensorFlow's built in argmax   function,  as follows: prediction_output = tf.matmul tf.mul y_target,b , pred_kernel  prediction = tf.arg_max prediction_output-tf.expand_dims tf. reduce_mean prediction_output,1 , 1 , 0  accuracy = tf.reduce_mean tf.cast tf.equal prediction,  tf.argmax y_target,0  , tf.float32    9.  Now that we have the kernel, loss, and prediction capabilities set up, we just   have to declare our optimizer function and initialize our variables, as follows: my_opt = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer 0.01  train_step = my_opt.minimize loss  init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   10.  This algorithm converges relatively quickly, so we won't have run the training loop for   more than 100 iterations. We do so with the following code: loss_vec = [] batch_accuracy = [] for i in range 100 :     rand_index = np.random.choice len x_vals , size=batch_size      rand_x = x_vals[rand_index]     rand_y = y_vals[:,rand_index]     sess.run train_step, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_target:  rand_y}           temp_loss = sess.run loss, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_ target: rand_y}      loss_vec.append temp_loss           acc_temp = sess.run accuracy, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_  116   target: rand_y, prediction_grid:rand_x}      batch_accuracy.append acc_temp           if  i+1 %25==0:         print 'Step ' + str i+1           print 'Loss = ' + str temp_loss   Step 25 Loss = -2.8951 Step 50 Loss = -27.9612 Step 75 Loss = -26.896 Step 100 Loss = -30.2325  11.  We can now create the prediction grid of points and run the prediction function on all   of them, as follows: x_min, x_max = x_vals[:, 0].min   - 1, x_vals[:, 0].max   + 1 y_min, y_max = x_vals[:, 1].min   - 1, x_vals[:, 1].max   + 1 xx, yy = np.meshgrid np.arange x_min, x_max, 0.02 ,                      np.arange y_min, y_max, 0.02   grid_points = np.c_[xx.ravel  , yy.ravel  ] grid_predictions = sess.run prediction, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x,                                                    y_target:  rand_y,                                                    prediction_ grid: grid_points}  grid_predictions = grid_predictions.reshape xx.shape   12. The following is code to plot the results, batch accuracy, and loss function. For   succinctness we will only display the end result: plt.contourf xx, yy, grid_predictions, cmap=plt.cm.Paired,  alpha=0.8  plt.plot class1_x, class1_y, 'ro', label='I. setosa'  plt.plot class2_x, class2_y, 'kx', label='I. versicolor'  plt.plot class3_x, class3_y, 'gv', label='I. virginica'  plt.title 'Gaussian SVM Results on Iris Data'  plt.xlabel 'Pedal Length'  plt.ylabel 'Sepal Width'  plt.legend loc='lower right'  plt.ylim [-0.5, 3.0]  plt.xlim [3.5, 8.5]   plt.show    plt.plot batch_accuracy, 'k-', label='Accuracy'   117   plt.title 'Batch Accuracy'  plt.xlabel 'Generation'  plt.ylabel 'Accuracy'  plt.legend loc='lower right'  plt.show    plt.plot loss_vec, 'k-'  plt.title 'Loss per Generation'  plt.xlabel 'Generation'  plt.ylabel 'Loss'  plt.show    Figure 10: Multi-class  three classes  nonlinear Gaussian SVM results    on the iris dataset with gamma = 10.  How it works… The important point to notice in this recipe is how we changed our algorithm to optimize over  three SVM models at once. Our model parameter, b, has an extra dimension to take into  account all three models. Here we can see that the extension of an algorithm to multiple  similar algorithms was made relatively easy owing to TensorFlow's built-in capabilities to deal  with extra dimensions.  118   5  Nearest Neighbor  Methods  This chapter will focus on nearest neighbor methods and how to implement them in  TensorFlow. We will start with an introduction to the method and show how to implement  various forms, and the chapter will end with examples of address matching and image  recognition. This is what we will cover:   f Working with Nearest Neighbors  f Working with Text-Based Distances  f Computing Mixed Distance Functions  f Using an Address Matching Example  f Using Nearest Neighbors for Image Recognition  Note that all the code is available online at https:  github.com nfmcclure  tensorflow_cookbook.  Introduction Nearest neighbor methods are based on a simple idea. We consider our training set as the  model and make predictions on new points based on how close they are to points in the  training set. The most naïve way is to make the prediction as the closest training data point  class. But since most datasets contain a degree of noise, a more common method would be  to take a weighted average of a set of k nearest neighbors. This method is called k-nearest  neighbors  k-NN .  119   Given a training dataset  can make a prediction on a point, z, by looking at a set of nearest neighbors. The actual  method of prediction depends on whether or not we are doing regression  continuous  classification  discrete   , with corresponding targets   , we    .    or   For discrete classification targets, the prediction may be given by a maximum voting scheme  weighted by the distance to the prediction point:  Here, our prediction, f z  is the maximum weighted value over all classes, j, where the  weighted distance from the prediction point to the training point, i, is given by  is just an indicator function if point i is in class j.  . And      For continuous regression targets, the prediction is given by a weighted average of all k points  nearest to the prediction:  It is obvious that the prediction is heavily dependent on the choice of the distance metric, d.  Common specifications of the distance metric are L1 and L2 distances:  There are many different specifications of distance metrics that we can choose. In this  chapter, we will explore the L1 and L2 metrics as well as edit and textual distances.  We also have to choose how to weight the distances. A straightforward way to weight the  distances is by the distance itself. Points that are further away from our prediction should  have less impact than nearer points. The most common way to weight is by the normalized  inverse of the distance. We will implement this method in the next recipe.  Note that k-NN is an aggregating method. For regression, we are  performing a weighted average of neighbors. Because of this,  predictions will be less extreme and less varied than the actual  targets. The magnitude of this effect will be determined by k, the  number of neighbors in the algorithm.   f   f   f  120   Working with Nearest Neighbors We start this chapter by implementing nearest neighbors to predict housing values. This is a  great way to start with nearest neighbors because we will be dealing with numerical features  and continuous targets.  Getting ready To illustrate how making predictions with nearest neighbors works in TensorFlow, we will use  the Boston housing dataset. Here we will be predicting the median neighborhood housing  value as a function of several features.  Since we consider the training set the trained model, we will find the k-NNs to the prediction  points and do a weighted average of the target value.  How to do it…  1.  First, we will start by loading the required libraries and starting a graph session. We   will use the requests module to load the necessary Boston housing data from the UCI  machine learning repository: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf import requests  sess = tf.Session    2.  Next, we will load the data using the requests module:  housing_url = 'https:  archive.ics.uci.edu ml machine-learning- databases housing housing.data'' housing_header = ['CRIM', 'ZN', 'INDUS', 'CHAS', 'NOX', 'RM',  'AGE', 'DIS', 'RAD', 'TAX', 'PTRATIO', 'B', 'LSTAT', 'MEDV'] cols_used = ['CRIM', 'INDUS', 'NOX', 'RM', 'AGE', 'DIS', 'TAX',  'PTRATIO', 'B', 'LSTAT'] num_features = len cols_used   Request data housing_file = requests.get housing_url   Parse Data housing_data = [[float x  for x in y.split ' '  if len x >=1] for  y in housing_file.text.split '\n'  if len y >=1]  121   3.  Next, we separate the data into our dependent and independent features. We will be  predicting the last variable, MEDV, which is the median value for the group of houses.  We will also not use the features ZN, CHAS, and RAD because of their uninformative  or binary nature: y_vals = np.transpose [np.array [y[13] for y in housing_data] ]  x_vals = np.array [[x for i,x in enumerate y  if housing_header[i]  in cols_used] for y in housing_data]   x_vals =  x_vals - x_vals.min 0     x_vals.ptp 0   4.  Now we split the x and y values into the train and test sets. We will create the training   set by selecting about 80% of the rows at random, and leave the remaining 20% for  the test set: train_indices = np.random.choice len x_vals , round len x_ vals *0.8 , replace=False  test_indices = np.array list set range len x_vals    - set train_ indices    x_vals_train = x_vals[train_indices] x_vals_test = x_vals[test_indices] y_vals_train = y_vals[train_indices] y_vals_test = y_vals[test_indices]  5.  Next, we declare our k value and batch size:  k = 4 batch_size=len x_vals_test   6.  We will declare our placeholders next. Remember that there are no model variables   to train, as the model is determined exactly by our training set: x_data_train = tf.placeholder shape=[None, num_features],  dtype=tf.float32  x_data_test = tf.placeholder shape=[None, num_features], dtype=tf. float32  y_target_train = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32  y_target_test = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32   7.  Next, we create our distance function for a batch of test points. Here, we illustrate   the use of the L1 distance: distance = tf.reduce_sum tf.abs tf.sub x_data_train, tf.expand_ dims x_data_test,1   , reduction_indices=2   122   Note that the L2 distance function can be used as well. We would  change the distance formula to the following: distance = tf.sqrt tf.reduce_sum tf.square tf. sub x_data_train, tf.expand_dims x_data_test,1   ,  reduction_indices=1    8.  Now we create our prediction function. To do this, we will use the top_k  ,   function, which returns the values and indices of the largest values in a tensor. Since  we want the indices of the smallest distances, we will instead find the k-biggest  negative distances. We also declare the predictions and the mean squared error   MSE  of the target values: top_k_xvals, top_k_indices = tf.nn.top_k tf.neg distance , k=k  x_sums = tf.expand_dims tf.reduce_sum top_k_xvals, 1 ,1  x_sums_repeated = tf.matmul x_sums,tf.ones [1, k], tf.float32   x_val_weights = tf.expand_dims tf.div top_k_xvals,x_sums_ repeated , 1   top_k_yvals = tf.gather y_target_train, top_k_indices  prediction = tf.squeeze tf.batch_matmul x_val_weights,top_k_ yvals , squeeze_dims=[1]  mse = tf.div tf.reduce_sum tf.square tf.sub prediction, y_target_ test   , batch_size   9.  Test:  num_loops = int np.ceil len x_vals_test  batch_size    for i in range num_loops :     min_index = i*batch_size     max_index = min  i+1 *batch_size,len x_vals_train       x_batch = x_vals_test[min_index:max_index]     y_batch = y_vals_test[min_index:max_index]     predictions = sess.run prediction, feed_dict={x_data_train:  x_vals_train, x_data_test: x_batch, y_target_train: y_vals_train,  y_target_test: y_batch}      batch_mse = sess.run mse, feed_dict={x_data_train: x_vals_ train, x_data_test: x_batch, y_target_train: y_vals_train, y_ target_test: y_batch}       print 'Batch '' + str i+1  + '' MSE: '' + str np.round batch_ mse,3     Batch 1 MSE: 23.153  123   10.  Additionally, we can also look at a histogram of the actual target values compared   with the predicted values. One reason to look at this is to notice the fact that with an  averaging method, we have trouble predicting the extreme ends of the targets: bins = np.linspace 5, 50, 45   plt.hist predictions, bins, alpha=0.5, label='Prediction''  plt.hist y_batch, bins, alpha=0.5, label='Actual''  plt.title 'Histogram of Predicted and Actual Values''  plt.xlabel 'Med Home Value in $1,000s''  plt.ylabel 'Frequency''  plt.legend loc='upper right''  plt.show    Figure 1: A histogram of the predicted values and actual target values for k-NN  k=4 .  11.  One hard thing to determine is the best value of k. For the preceding figure and   predictions, we used k=4 for our model. We chose this specifically because it gives us  the lowest MSE. This is verified by cross validation. If we use cross validation across  multiple values of k, we will see that k=4 gives us a minimum MSE. We show this  in the following figure. It is also worthwhile to plotting the variance in the predicted  values to show that it will decrease the more neighbors we average over:  124   Figure 2: The MSE for k-NN predictions for various values of k. We also plot the variance   of the predicted values on the test set. Note that the variance decreases as k increases.  How it works… With the nearest neighbors algorithm, the model is the training set. Because of this, we   do not have to train any variables in our model. The only parameter, k, we determined via  cross-validation to minimize our MSE.  There's more… For the weighting of the k-NN, we chose to weight directly by the distance. There are other  options that we could consider as well. Another common method is to weight by the inverse  squared distance.  Working with Text-Based Distances Nearest neighbors is more versatile than just dealing with numbers. As long as we have a way  to measure distances between features, we can apply the nearest neighbors algorithm. In this  recipe, we will introduce how to measure text distances with TensorFlow.  Getting ready In this recipe, we will illustrate how to use TensorFlow's text distance metric, the Levenshtein  distance  the edit distance , between strings. This will be important later in this chapter as we  expand the nearest neighbor methods to include features with text.  125   The Levenshtein distance is the minimal number of edits to get from one string to another  string. The allowed edits are inserting a character, deleting a character, or substituting  a character with a different one. For this recipe, we will use TensorFlow's Levenshtein  distance function, edit_distance  . It is worthwhile to illustrate the use of this function  because the usage of this function will be applicable to later chapters.  Note that TensorFlow's edit_distance   function only accepts  sparse tensors. We will have to create our strings as sparse tensors  of individual characters.  How to do it…  1.  First, we load TensorFlow and initialize a graph:  import tensorflow as tf sess = tf.Session    2.  Then we will show how to calculate the edit distance between two words, 'bear'  and 'beer'. First, we will create a list of characters from our strings with Python's  'list  ' function. Next, we create a sparse 3D matrix from that list. We have to tell  TensorFlow the character indices, the shape of the matrix, and which characters we  want in the tensor. After this we can decide if we would like to go with the total edit  distance  normalize=False  or the normalized edit distance  normalize=True ,  where we divide the edit distance by the length of the second word:  TensorFlow's documentation treats the two strings as a  proposed  hypothesis  string and a ground truth string. We  will continue this notation here with h and t tensors.  hypothesis = list 'bear''  truth = list 'beers''  h1 = tf.SparseTensor [[0,0,0], [0,0,1], [0,0,2], [0,0,3]],                      hypothesis, [1,1,1]  t1 = tf.SparseTensor [[0,0,0], [0,0,1], [0,0,2], [0,0,3],[0,0,4]],  truth, [1,1,1]   print sess.run tf.edit_distance h1, t1, normalize=False     3.  This results in the following output:  [[ 2.]]  126   The function, SparseTensorValue  , is a way to create a  sparse tensor in TensorFlow. It accepts the indices, values, and  shape of a sparse tensor we wish to create.  4.  Next, we will illustrate how to compare two words, bear and beer, both with another   word, beers. In order to achieve this, we must replicate the beers in order to have  the same amount of comparable words: hypothesis2 = list 'bearbeer'  truth2 = list 'beersbeers'  h2 = tf.SparseTensor [[0,0,0], [0,0,1], [0,0,2], [0,0,3], [0,1,0],  [0,1,1], [0,1,2], [0,1,3]], hypothesis2, [1,2,4]  t2 = tf.SparseTensor [[0,0,0], [0,0,1], [0,0,2], [0,0,3], [0,0,4],  [0,1,0], [0,1,1], [0,1,2], [0,1,3], [0,1,4]], truth2, [1,2,5]   print sess.run tf.edit_distance h2, t2, normalize=True     5.  This results in the following output: [[ 0.40000001  0.2       ]]  6.  A more efficient way to compare a set of words against another word is shown in   this example. We create the indices and list of characters beforehand for both the  hypothesis and ground truth string: hypothesis_words = ['bear','bar','tensor','flow'] truth_word = ['beers''] num_h_words = len hypothesis_words  h_indices = [[xi, 0, yi] for xi,x in enumerate hypothesis_words   for yi,y in enumerate x ] h_chars = list '''.join hypothesis_words   h3 = tf.SparseTensor h_indices, h_chars, [num_h_words,1,1]  truth_word_vec = truth_word*num_h_words t_indices = [[xi, 0, yi] for xi,x in enumerate truth_word_vec  for  yi,y in enumerate x ] t_chars = list '''.join truth_word_vec   t3 = tf.SparseTensor t_indices, t_chars, [num_h_words,1,1]   print sess.run tf.edit_distance h3, t3, normalize=True     7.  This results in the following output:  [[ 0.40000001]  [ 0.60000002]  [ 0.80000001]  [ 1.        ]]  127   8.  Now we will illustrate how to calculate the edit distance between two word   lists using placeholders. The concept is the same, except we will be feeding in  SparseTensorValue   instead of sparse tensors. First, we will create a function  that creates the sparse tensors from a word list: def create_sparse_vec word_list :     num_words = len word_list      indices = [[xi, 0, yi] for xi,x in enumerate word_list  for  yi,y in enumerate x ]     chars = list '''.join word_list       return tf.SparseTensorValue indices, chars, [num_words,1,1]    hyp_string_sparse = create_sparse_vec hypothesis_words  truth_string_sparse = create_sparse_vec truth_word*len hypothesis_ words    hyp_input = tf.sparse_placeholder dtype=tf.string  truth_input = tf.sparse_placeholder dtype=tf.string   edit_distances = tf.edit_distance hyp_input, truth_input,  normalize=True   feed_dict = {hyp_input: hyp_string_sparse,              truth_input: truth_string_sparse}               print sess.run edit_distances, feed_dict=feed_dict    9.  This results in the following output:  [[ 0.40000001]  [ 0.60000002]  [ 0.80000001]  [ 1.        ]]  How it works… For this recipe, we have shown that we can measure text distances several ways using  TensorFlow. This will be extremely useful for performing nearest neighbors on data that has  text features. We will see more of this later in the chapter when we perform address matching.  128   There's more… Other text distance metrics exist that we should discuss. Here is a definition table describing  other various text distances between two strings, s1 and s2:  Name Hamming distance  Cosine distance  Jaccard distance  Description Number of equal character  positions. Only valid if the strings  are equal length. The dot product of the k-gram  differences divided by the L2  norm of the k-gram differences. Number of characters in common  divided by the total union of  characters in both strings.  Formula  , where I is  an indicator function of equal  characters.  Computing with Mixed Distance Functions When dealing with data observations that have multiple features, we should be aware that  features can be scaled differently on different scales. In this recipe, we account for that to  improve our housing value predictions.  Getting ready It is important to extend the nearest neighbor algorithm to take into account variables that  are scaled differently. In this example, we will show how to scale the distance function for  different variables. Specifically, we will scale the distance function as a function of the  feature variance.  The key to weighting the distance function is to use a weight matrix. The distance function  written with matrix operations becomes the following formula:  Here, A is a diagonal weight matrix that we use to scale the distance metric for each feature.  For this recipe, we will try to improve our MSE on the Boston housing value dataset. This  dataset is a great example of features that are on different scales, and the nearest neighbor  algorithm would benefit from scaling the distance function.  129   How to do it…  1.  First, we will load the necessary libraries and start a graph session:  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf import requests sess = tf.Session    2.  Next, we load the data and store it in a numpy array. Again, note that we will only use   certain columns for prediction. We do not use id variables nor variables that have  very low variance: housing_url = 'https:  archive.ics.uci.edu ml machine-learning- databases housing housing.data'' housing_header = ['CRIM', 'ZN', 'INDUS', 'CHAS', 'NOX', 'RM',  'AGE', 'DIS', 'RAD', 'TAX', 'PTRATIO', 'B', 'LSTAT', 'MEDV'] cols_used = ['CRIM', 'INDUS', 'NOX', 'RM', 'AGE', 'DIS', 'TAX',  'PTRATIO', 'B', 'LSTAT'] num_features = len cols_used  housing_file = requests.get housing_url  housing_data = [[float x  for x in y.split ' '  if len x >=1] for  y in housing_file.text.split '\n'  if len y >=1] y_vals = np.transpose [np.array [y[13] for y in housing_data] ]  x_vals = np.array [[x for i,x in enumerate y  if housing_header[i]  in cols_used] for y in housing_data]   3.  Now we scale the x values to be between zero and 1 with min-max scaling:  x_vals =  x_vals - x_vals.min 0     x_vals.ptp 0   4.  We now create the diagonal weight matrix that will provide the scaling of the distance   metric by the standard deviation of the features: weight_diagonal = x_vals.std 0  weight_matrix = tf.cast tf.diag weight_diagonal , dtype=tf. float32   5.  Now we split the data into a training and test set. We also declare k, the amount of   nearest neighbors, and make the batch size equal to the test set size: train_indices = np.random.choice len x_vals , round len x_ vals *0.8 , replace=False  test_indices = np.array list set range len x_vals    - set train_ indices    x_vals_train = x_vals[train_indices] x_vals_test = x_vals[test_indices] y_vals_train = y_vals[train_indices] y_vals_test = y_vals[test_indices]  130   k = 4 batch_size=len x_vals_test   6.  We declare our placeholders that we need next. We have four placeholders, the   x-inputs and y-targets for both the training and test set: x_data_train = tf.placeholder shape=[None, num_features],  dtype=tf.float32  x_data_test = tf.placeholder shape=[None, num_features], dtype=tf. float32  y_target_train = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32  y_target_test = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32   7.  Now we can declare our distance function. For readability, we break up the   distance function into its components. Note that we will have to tile the weight  matrix by the batch size and use the batch_matmul   function to perform batch  matrix multiplication across the batch size: subtraction_term =  tf.sub x_data_train, tf.expand_dims x_data_ test,1   first_product = tf.batch_matmul subtraction_term, tf.tile tf. expand_dims weight_matrix,0 , [batch_size,1,1]   second_product = tf.batch_matmul first_product,  tf.transpose subtraction_term, perm=[0,2,1]   distance = tf.sqrt tf.batch_matrix_diag_part second_product    8.  After we calculate all the training distances for each test point, we need to return  the top k-NNs. We do this with the top_k   function. Since this function returns  the largest values, and we want the smallest distances, we return the largest of the  negative distance values. We then want to make predictions as the weighted average  of the distances of the top k neighbors: top_k_xvals, top_k_indices = tf.nn.top_k tf.neg distance , k=k  x_sums = tf.expand_dims tf.reduce_sum top_k_xvals, 1 ,1  x_sums_repeated = tf.matmul x_sums,tf.ones [1, k], tf.float32   x_val_weights = tf.expand_dims tf.div top_k_xvals,x_sums_ repeated , 1  top_k_yvals = tf.gather y_target_train, top_k_indices  prediction = tf.squeeze tf.batch_matmul x_val_weights,top_k_ yvals , squeeze_dims=[1]   9.  To evaluate our model, we calculate the MSE of our predictions:  mse = tf.div tf.reduce_sum tf.square tf.sub prediction, y_target_ test   , batch_size   10.  Now we can loop through our test batches and calculate the MSE for each:  num_loops = int np.ceil len x_vals_test  batch_size   for i in range num_loops :     min_index = i*batch_size  131       max_index = min  i+1 *batch_size,len x_vals_train       x_batch = x_vals_test[min_index:max_index]     y_batch = y_vals_test[min_index:max_index]     predictions = sess.run prediction, feed_dict={x_data_train:  x_vals_train, x_data_test: x_batch, y_target_train: y_vals_train,  y_target_test: y_batch}      batch_mse = sess.run mse, feed_dict={x_data_train: x_vals_ train, x_data_test: x_batch, y_target_train: y_vals_train, y_ target_test: y_batch}      print 'Batch '' + str i+1  + '' MSE: '' + str np.round batch_ mse,3     11.  This results in the following output:  Batch 1 MSE: 21.322  12. As a final comparison, we can plot the distribution of housing values for the actual   test set and the predictions on the test set with the following code: bins = np.linspace 5, 50, 45  plt.hist predictions, bins, alpha=0.5, label='Prediction''  plt.hist y_batch, bins, alpha=0.5, label='Actual''  plt.title 'Histogram of Predicted and Actual Values''  plt.xlabel 'Med Home Value in $1,000s''  plt.ylabel 'Frequency''  plt.legend loc='upper right''  plt.show    Figure 3: The two histograms of the predicted and actual housing values on the Boston dataset.    This time we have scaled the distance function differently for each feature.  132   How it works… We decreased our MSE on the test set here by introducing a method of scaling the distance  functions for each feature. Here, we scaled the distance functions by a factor of the  feature's standard deviation. This provides a more accurate view of measuring which points  are the closest neighbors or not. From this we also took the weighted average of the top k  neighbors as a function of distance to get the housing value prediction.  There's more… This scaling factor can also be used to down-weight or up-weight features in the nearest  neighbor distance calculation. This can be useful in situations where we trust features more  or less than others.  Using an Address Matching Example Now that we have measured numerical and text distances, we will spend time learning how   to combine them to measure distances between observations that have both text and  numerical features.  Getting ready Nearest neighbor is a great algorithm to use for address matching. Address matching is a  type of record matching in which we have addresses in multiple datasets and we would like  to match them up. In address matching, we may have typos in the address, different cities,  or different zip codes, but they may all refer to the same address. Using the nearest neighbor  algorithm across the numerical and character components of an address may help us identify  addresses that are actually the same.  In this example, we will generate two datasets. Each dataset will comprise a street address  and a zip code. But one dataset has a high number of typos in the street address. We will  take the non-typo dataset as our gold standard and return one address from it for each typo  address that is the closest as a function of the string distance  for the street  and numerical  distance  for the zip code .  The first part of the code will focus on generating the two datasets. Then the second part of  the code will run through the test set and return the closest address from the training set.  133   How to do it…  1.  We first start by loading the necessary libraries:  import random import string import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf  2.  We will now create the reference dataset. To show succinct output, we will only make   each dataset comprise of 10 addresses  but it can be run with many more : n = 10 street_names = ['abbey', 'baker', 'canal', 'donner', 'elm'] street_types = ['rd', 'st', 'ln', 'pass', 'ave'] rand_zips = [random.randint 65000,65999  for i in range 5 ] numbers = [random.randint 1, 9999  for i in range n ] streets = [random.choice street_names  for i in range n ] street_suffs = [random.choice street_types  for i in range n ] zips = [random.choice rand_zips  for i in range n ] full_streets = [str x  + ' ' + y + ' ' + z for x,y,z in  zip numbers, streets, street_suffs ] reference_data = [list x  for x in zip full_streets,zips ]  3.  To create the test set, we need a function that will randomly create a typo in a string   and return the resulting string: def create_typo s, prob=0.75 :     if random.uniform 0,1  < prob:         rand_ind = random.choice range len s            s_list = list s          s_list[rand_ind]=random.choice string.ascii_lowercase          s = '''.join s_list      return s  typo_streets = [create_typo x  for x in streets] typo_full_streets = [str x  + ' ' + y + ' ' + z for x,y,z in  zip numbers, typo_streets, street_suffs ] test_data = [list x  for x in zip typo_full_streets,zips ]  4.  Now we can initialize a graph session and declare the placeholders we need. We will  need four placeholders in each test and reference set, and we will need an address  and zip code placeholder: sess = tf.Session   test_address = tf.sparse_placeholder  dtype=tf.string  test_zip = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32  ref_address = tf.sparse_placeholder dtype=tf.string  ref_zip = tf.placeholder shape=[None, n], dtype=tf.float32   134   5.  Now we declare the numerical zip distance and the edit distance for the    address string: zip_dist = tf.square tf.sub ref_zip, test_zip   address_dist = tf.edit_distance test_address, ref_address,  normalize=True   6.  We now convert the zip distance and the address distance into similarities. For the  similarities, we want a similarity of 1 when the two inputs are exactly the same and  near 0 when they are very different. For the zip distance, we can do this by taking the  distances, subtracting from the max, and then dividing by the range of the distances.  For the address similarity, since the distance is already scaled between 0 and 1, we  just subtract it from 1 to get the similarity: zip_max = tf.gather tf.squeeze zip_dist , tf.argmax zip_dist, 1   zip_min = tf.gather tf.squeeze zip_dist , tf.argmin zip_dist, 1   zip_sim = tf.div tf.sub zip_max, zip_dist , tf.sub zip_max, zip_ min   address_sim = tf.sub 1., address_dist   7.  To combine the two similarity functions, we take a weighted average of the two. For   this recipe, we put equal weight on the address and the zip code. We can also change  this depending on how much we trust each feature. We then return the index of the  highest similarity of the reference set: address_weight = 0.5 zip_weight = 1. - address_weight weighted_sim = tf.add tf.transpose tf.mul address_weight, address_ sim  , tf.mul zip_weight, zip_sim   top_match_index = tf.argmax weighted_sim, 1   8.   In order to use the edit distance in TensorFlow, we have to convert the address strings  to a sparse vector. In a prior recipe in this chapter, Working with Text- Based Distances  recipe, we created the following function and will use it in this recipe as well: def sparse_from_word_vec word_vec :     num_words = len word_vec      indices = [[xi, 0, yi] for xi,x in enumerate word_vec  for  yi,y in enumerate x ]     chars = list '''.join word_vec        Now we return our sparse vector     return tf.SparseTensorValue indices, chars, [num_words,1,1]    9.  We need to separate the addresses and zip codes in the reference dataset, so we   can feed them into the placeholders when we loop through the test set: reference_addresses = [x[0] for x in reference_data] reference_zips = np.array [[x[1] for x in reference_data]]   135   10.  We need to create the sparse tensor set of reference addresses using the function   we created in step 8: sparse_ref_set = sparse_from_word_vec reference_addresses   11.  Now we can loop though each entry of the test set and return the index of the   reference set that it is the closest to. We print off both the test and reference for   each entry. As you can see, we have great results on this generated dataset: for i in range n :     test_address_entry = test_data[i][0]     test_zip_entry = [[test_data[i][1]]]           Create sparse address vectors     test_address_repeated = [test_address_entry] * n     sparse_test_set = sparse_from_word_vec test_address_repeated           feeddict={test_address: sparse_test_set,                test_zip: test_zip_entry,                ref_address: sparse_ref_set,                ref_zip: reference_zips}     best_match = sess.run top_match_index, feed_dict=feeddict      best_street = reference_addresses[best_match]     [best_zip] = reference_zips[0][best_match]     [[test_zip_]] = test_zip_entry     print 'Address: '' + str test_address_entry  + '', '' +  str test_zip_       print 'Match  : '' + str best_street  + '', '' + str best_ zip    12. This results in the following output:  Address: 8659 beker ln, 65463 Match  : 8659 baker ln, 65463 Address: 1048 eanal ln, 65681 Match  : 1048 canal ln, 65681 Address: 1756 vaker st, 65983 Match  : 1756 baker st, 65983 Address: 900 abbjy pass, 65983 Match  : 900 abbey pass, 65983 Address: 5025 canal rd, 65463 Match  : 5025 canal rd, 65463 Address: 6814 elh st, 65154 Match  : 6814 elm st, 65154 Address: 3057 cagal ave, 65463 Match  : 3057 canal ave, 65463 Address: 7776 iaker ln, 65681  136   Match  : 7776 baker ln, 65681 Address: 5167 caker rd, 65154 Match  : 5167 baker rd, 65154 Address: 8765 donnor st, 65154 Match  : 8765 donner st, 65154  How it works… One of the hard things to figure out in address matching problems like this is the value of  the weights and how to scale the distances. This may take some exploration and insight into  the data itself. Also, when dealing with addresses we may consider different components  than we did here. We may consider the street number a separate component from the street  address, or even have other components, such as city and state. When dealing with numerical  address components, note that they can be treated as numbers  with a numerical distance   or as characters  with an edit distance . It is up to you to choose how. Also note that we might  consider using an edit distance with the zip code if we think that typos in the zip code come  from human entry and not, say, computer mapping errors.  To get a feel for how typos affect the results, we encourage the reader to change the typo  function to make more typos or more frequent typos and increase the dataset's size to see  how well this algorithm works.  Using Nearest Neighbors for Image  Recognition  Getting ready Nearest neighbors can also be used for image recognition. The Hello World of image  recognition datasets is the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. Since we will be using this  dataset for various neural network image recognition algorithms in later chapters, it will be  great to compare the results to a non-neural network algorithm.  The MNIST digit dataset is composed of thousands of labeled images that are 28x28 pixels in  size. Although this is considered to be a small image, it has a total of 784 pixels  or features   for the nearest neighbor algorithm. We will compute the nearest neighbor prediction for this  categorical problem by considering the mode prediction of the nearest k neighbors  k=4 in  this example .  137   How to do it…  1.  We start by loading the necessary libraries. Note that we will also import the Python   Image Library  PIL  to be able to plot a sample of the predicted outputs. And  TensorFlow has a built-in method to load the MNIST dataset that we will use: import random import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from PIL import Image from tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist import input_data  2.  Now we start a graph session and load the MNIST data in a one hot encoded form:  sess = tf.Session   mnist = input_data.read_data_sets "MNIST_data "", one_hot=True   One hot encoding is a numerical representation of categorical  values that are better suited for numerical computations. Here  we have 10 categories  numbers 0-9 , and represent them  as a 0-1 vector of length 10. For example, the '0' category  is denoted by the vector 1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, the 1 vector is  denoted by 0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, and so on.  3.  Because the MNIST dataset is large and computing the distances between 784  features on tens of thousands of inputs would be computationally hard, we will  sample a smaller set of images to train on. Also, we choose a test set number that  is divisible by six six only for plotting purposes, as we will plot the last batch of six  images to see a sample of the results: train_size = 1000 test_size = 102 rand_train_indices = np.random.choice len mnist.train.images ,  train_size, replace=False  rand_test_indices = np.random.choice len mnist.test.images , test_ size, replace=False  x_vals_train = mnist.train.images[rand_train_indices] x_vals_test = mnist.test.images[rand_test_indices] y_vals_train = mnist.train.labels[rand_train_indices] y_vals_test = mnist.test.labels[rand_test_indices]  4.  We declare our k value and batch size:  k = 4 batch_size=6  138   5.  Now we initialize our placeholders that we will feed in the graph:  x_data_train = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 784], dtype=tf.float32  x_data_test = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 784], dtype=tf.float32  y_target_train = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 10], dtype=tf. float32  y_target_test = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 10], dtype=tf.float32   6.  We declare our distance metric. Here we will use the L1 metric  absolute value : distance = tf.reduce_sum tf.abs tf.sub x_data_train, tf.expand_ dims x_data_test,1   , reduction_indices=2   Note that we can also make our distance function use the  L2 distance by using the following code instead: distance  = tf.sqrt tf.reduce_sum tf.square tf.sub x_ data_train, tf.expand_dims x_data_test,1   ,  reduction_indices=1    7.  Now we find the top k images that are the closest and predict the mode. The mode  will be performed on one hot encoded indices and counting which occurs the most: top_k_xvals, top_k_indices = tf.nn.top_k tf.neg distance , k=k  prediction_indices = tf.gather y_target_train, top_k_indices  count_of_predictions = tf.reduce_sum prediction_indices,  reduction_indices=1  prediction = tf.argmax count_of_predictions, dimension=1   8.  We can now loop through our test set, compute the predictions, and store them:  num_loops = int np.ceil len x_vals_test  batch_size   test_output = [] actual_vals = [] for i in range num_loops :     min_index = i*batch_size     max_index = min  i+1 *batch_size,len x_vals_train       x_batch = x_vals_test[min_index:max_index]     y_batch = y_vals_test[min_index:max_index]     predictions = sess.run prediction, feed_dict={x_data_train: x_ vals_train, x_data_test: x_batch,                                          y_target_train: y_vals_ train, y_target_test: y_batch}      test_output.extend predictions      actual_vals.extend np.argmax y_batch, axis=1    139   9.  Now that we have saved the actual and predicted output, we can calculate the   accuracy. This will change due to our random sampling of the test training datasets,  but we should end up with accuracies of around 80% to 90%: accuracy = sum [1. test_size for i in range test_size  if test_ output[i]==actual_vals[i]]  print 'Accuracy on test set: '' + str accuracy   Accuracy on test set: 0.8333333333333325  10.  Here is the code to plot the last batch results: actuals = np.argmax y_batch, axis=1  Nrows = 2 Ncols = 3 for i in range len actuals  :     plt.subplot Nrows, Ncols, i+1      plt.imshow np.reshape x_batch[i], [28,28] , cmap='Greys_r''      plt.title 'Actual: '' + str actuals[i]  + '' Pred: '' +  str predictions[i] , fontsize=10      frame = plt.gca       frame.axes.get_xaxis  .set_visible False      frame.axes.get_yaxis  .set_visible False   Figure 4: The last batch of six images we ran our nearest neighbor prediction on.    We can see that we do not get all of the images exactly correct  140   How it works… Given enough computation time and computational resources, we could have made the  test and training sets bigger. This probably would have increased our accuracy, and also  is a common way to prevent overfitting. Also, this algorithm warrants further exploration  on the ideal k value to choose. The k value would be chosen after a set of cross-validation  experiments on the dataset.  There's more… We can also use the nearest neighbor algorithm here for evaluating unseen numbers from  the user as well. Please see the online repository for a way to use this model to evaluate user  input digits here: https:  github.com nfmcclure tensorflow_cookbook.  In this chapter, we've explored how to use kNN algorithms for regression and classification.  We've talked about the different usage of distance functions and how to mix them together.  We encourage the reader to explore different distance metrics, weights, and k values to  optimize the accuracy of these methods.  141    6  Neural Networks  In this chapter, we will introduce neural networks and how to implement them in TensorFlow.  Most of the subsequent chapters will be based on neural networks, so learning how to use  them in TensorFlow is very important. We will start by introducing basic concepts of neural  networking and work up to multilayer networks. In the last section, we will create a neural  network that learns to play Tic Tac Toe.  In this chapter, we'll cover the following recipes:   f Implementing Operational Gates  f Working with Gates and Activation Functions  f Implementing a One-Layer Neural Network  f Implementing Different Layers  f Using Multilayer Networks  f Improving Predictions of Linear Models  f Learning to Play Tic Tac Toe  The reader can find all the code from this chapter online, at https:  github.com  nfmcclure tensorflow_cookbook.  Introduction Neural networks are currently breaking records in tasks such as image and speech  recognition, reading handwriting, understanding text, image segmentation, dialog systems,  autonomous car driving, and so much more. While some of these aforementioned tasks  will be covered in later chapters, it is important to introduce neural networks as an easy-to- implement machine learning algorithm, so that we can expand on it later.  143   The concept of a neural network has been around for decades. However, it only recently  gained traction computationally because we now have the computational power to train large  networks because of advances in processing power, algorithm efficiency, and data sizes.  A neural network is basically a sequence of operations applied to a matrix of input data. These  operations are usually collections of additions and multiplications followed by applications of  non-linear functions. One example that we have already seen is logistic regression, the last  section in Chapter 3, Linear Regression. Logistic regression is the sum of the partial slope- feature products followed by the application of the sigmoid function, which is non-linear.  Neural networks generalize this a bit more by allowing any combination of operations and  non-linear functions, which includes the applications of absolute value, maximum, minimum,  and so on.  The important trick with neural networks is called 'backpropagation'. Back propagation is a  procedure that allows us to update the model variables based on the learning rate and the  output of the loss function. We used back propagation to update our model variables in the  Chapter 3, Linear Regression and Chapter 4, and the Support Vector Machine.  Another important feature to take note of in neural networks is the non-linear activation  function. Since most neural networks are just combinations of addition and multiplication  operations, they will not be able to model non-linear datasets. To address this issue, we have  used the non-linear activation functions in the neural networks. This will allow the neural  network to adapt to most non-linear situations.  It is important to remember that, like most of the algorithms we have seen so far, neural  networks are sensitive to the hyper-parameters that we choose. In this chapter, we will see the  impact of different learning rates, loss functions, and optimization procedures.  144   There are more resources for learning about neural networks that are more  in-depth and detailed.

Implementing Operational Gates One of the most fundamental concepts of neural networks is an operation known as an  operational gate. In this section, we will start with a multiplication operation as a gate and  then we will consider nested gate operations.  Getting ready The first operational gate we will implement looks like f x =a.x. To optimize this gate, we  declare the a input as a variable and the x input as a placeholder. This means that TensorFlow  will try to change the a value and not the x value. We will create the loss function as the  difference between the output and the target value, which is 50.  145   The second, nested operational gate will be f x =a.x+b. Again, we will declare a and b as  variables and x as a placeholder. We optimize the output toward the target value of 50 again.  The interesting thing to note is that the solution for this second example is not unique. There  are many combinations of model variables that will allow the output to be 50. With neural  networks, we do not care as much for the values of the intermediate model variables, but  place more emphasis on the desired output.  Think of the operations as operational gates on our computational graph. Here is a figure  depicting the two examples:  Figure 1: Two operational gate examples in this section.  How to do it… To implement the first operational f x =a.x in TensorFlow and train the output toward  the  value of 50, follow these steps:  1.  We start off by loading TensorFlow and creating a graph session:  import tensorflow as tf sess = tf.Session    2.  Now, we declare our model variable, input data, and placeholder. We make our input  data equal to the value 5, so that the multiplication factor to get 50 will be 10  that is,  5X10=50 : a = tf.Variable tf.constant 4.   x_val = 5. x_data = tf.placeholder dtype=tf.float32   146   3.  Next we add the operation to our computational graph:  multiplication = tf.mul a, x_data   4.  We will declare the loss function as the L2 distance between the output and the   desired target value of 50: loss = tf.square tf.sub multiplication, 50.    5.  Now we initialize our model variable and declare our optimizing algorithm as the   standard gradient descent: init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init  my_opt = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer 0.01  train_step = my_opt.minimize loss   6.  We can now optimize our model output towards the desired value of 50. We do this   by continually feeding in the input value of 5 and back propagating the loss to update  the model variable towards the value of 10: print 'Optimizing a Multiplication Gate Output to 50.'  for i in range 10 :     sess.run train_step, feed_dict={x_data: x_val}      a_val = sess.run a      mult_output = sess.run multiplication, feed_dict={x_data: x_ val}  print str a_val  + ' * ' + str x_val  + ' = ' + str mult_output    7.  This results in the following output:  Optimizing a Multiplication Gate Output to 50. 7.0 * 5.0 = 35.0 8.5 * 5.0 = 42.5 9.25 * 5.0 = 46.25 9.625 * 5.0 = 48.125 9.8125 * 5.0 = 49.0625 9.90625 * 5.0 = 49.5312 9.95312 * 5.0 = 49.7656 9.97656 * 5.0 = 49.8828 9.98828 * 5.0 = 49.9414 9.99414 * 5.0 = 49.9707  8.  Next, we will do the same with a two-nested operations, f x =a.x+b.  147   9.  We will start in exactly same way as the preceding example, except now we'll initialize   two model variables, a and b: from tensorflow.python.framework import ops ops.reset_default_graph   sess = tf.Session    a = tf.Variable tf.constant 1.   b = tf.Variable tf.constant 1.   x_val = 5. x_data = tf.placeholder dtype=tf.float32   two_gate = tf.add tf.mul a, x_data , b   loss = tf.square tf.sub two_gate, 50.    my_opt = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer 0.01  train_step = my_opt.minimize loss   init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   10.  We now optimize the model variables to train the output towards the target    value of 50: print '\nOptimizing Two Gate Output to 50.'  for i in range 10 :      Run the train step     sess.run train_step, feed_dict={x_data: x_val}       Get the a and b values     a_val, b_val =  sess.run a , sess.run b        Run the two-gate graph output     two_gate_output = sess.run two_gate, feed_dict={x_data: x_ val}      print str a_val  + ' * ' + str x_val  + ' + ' + str b_val  + '  = ' + str two_gate_output    11.  This results in the following output:  Optimizing Two Gate Output to 50. 5.4 * 5.0 + 1.88 = 28.88 7.512 * 5.0 + 2.3024 = 39.8624 8.52576 * 5.0 + 2.50515 = 45.134 9.01236 * 5.0 + 2.60247 = 47.6643 9.24593 * 5.0 + 2.64919 = 48.8789 9.35805 * 5.0 + 2.67161 = 49.4619 9.41186 * 5.0 + 2.68237 = 49.7417  148   9.43769 * 5.0 + 2.68754 = 49.876 9.45009 * 5.0 + 2.69002 = 49.9405 9.45605 * 5.0 + 2.69121 = 49.9714  It is important to note here that the solution to the second example is not  unique. This does not matter as much in neural networks, as all parameters  are adjusted towards reducing the loss. The final solution here will depend on  the initial values of a and b. If these were randomly initialized, instead of to  the value of 1, we would see different ending values for the model variables  for each iteration.  How it works… We achieved the optimization of a computational gate via TensorFlow's implicit back  propagation. TensorFlow keeps track of our model's operations and variable values and  makes adjustments in respect of our optimization algorithm specification and the output of  the loss function.  We can keep expanding the operational gates, while keeping track of which inputs are  variables and which inputs are data. This is important to keep track of, because TensorFlow  will change all variables to minimize the loss, but not the data, which is declared as  placeholders.  The implicit ability to keep track of the computational graph and update the model variables  automatically with every training step is one of the great features of TensorFlow and what  makes it so powerful.  Working with Gates and Activation  Functions Now that we can link together operational gates, we will want to run the computational graph  output through an activation function. Here we introduce common activation functions.   Getting ready In this section, we will compare and contrast two different activation functions, the sigmoid  and the rectified linear unit  ReLU . Recall that the two functions are given by the following  equations:  149   In this example, we will create two one-layer neural networks with the same structure except  one will feed through the sigmoid activation and one will feed through the ReLU activation.  The loss function will be governed by the L2 distance from the value 0.75. We will randomly  pull batch data from a normal distribution  Normal mean=2, sd=0.1  , and optimize the  output towards 0.75.  How to do it…  1.  We'll start by loading the necessary libraries and initializing a graph. This is also  a good point to bring up how to set a random seed with TensorFlow. Since we will  be using a random number generator from NumPy and TensorFlow, we need to set  a random seed for both. With the same random seeds set, we should be able to  replicate: import tensorflow as tf import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt sess = tf.Session   tf.set_random_seed 5  np.random.seed 42   2.  Now we'll declare our batch size, model variables, data, and a placeholder for   feeding the data in. Our computational graph will consist of feeding in our normally  distributed data into two similar neural networks that differ only by the activation  function at the end: batch_size = 50 a1 = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1,1]   b1 = tf.Variable tf.random_uniform shape=[1,1]   a2 = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1,1]   b2 = tf.Variable tf.random_uniform shape=[1,1]   x = np.random.normal 2, 0.1, 500  x_data = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32   3.  Next, we'll declare our two models, the sigmoid activation model and the ReLU   activation model: sigmoid_activation = tf.sigmoid tf.add tf.matmul x_data, a1 , b1   relu_activation = tf.nn.relu tf.add tf.matmul x_data, a2 , b2    4.  The loss functions will be the average L2 norm between the model output and the   value of 0.75: loss1 = tf.reduce_mean tf.square tf.sub sigmoid_activation,  0.75    loss2 = tf.reduce_mean tf.square tf.sub relu_activation, 0.75     150   5.  Now we declare our optimization algorithm and initialize our variables:  my_opt = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer 0.01  train_step_sigmoid = my_opt.minimize loss1  train_step_relu = my_opt.minimize loss2  init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   6.  Now we'll loop through our training for 750 iterations for both models. We will also   save the loss output and the activation output values for plotting after: loss_vec_sigmoid = [] loss_vec_relu = [] activation_sigmoid = [] activation_relu = [] for i in range 750 :     rand_indices = np.random.choice len x , size=batch_size      x_vals = np.transpose [x[rand_indices]]      sess.run train_step_sigmoid, feed_dict={x_data: x_vals}      sess.run train_step_relu, feed_dict={x_data: x_vals}       loss_vec_sigmoid.append sess.run loss1, feed_dict={x_data: x_ vals}       loss_vec_relu.append sess.run loss2, feed_dict={x_data: x_ vals}        activation_sigmoid.append np.mean sess.run sigmoid_activation,  feed_dict={x_data: x_vals}    activation_relu.append np.mean sess.run relu_activation, feed_ dict={x_data: x_vals}     7.  The following is the code to plot the loss and the activation outputs:  plt.plot activation_sigmoid, 'k-', label='Sigmoid Activation'  plt.plot activation_relu, 'r--', label='Relu Activation'  plt.ylim [0, 1.0]  plt.title 'Activation Outputs'  plt.xlabel 'Generation'  plt.ylabel 'Outputs'  plt.legend loc='upper right'  plt.show   plt.plot loss_vec_sigmoid, 'k-', label='Sigmoid Loss'  plt.plot loss_vec_relu, 'r--', label='Relu Loss'  plt.ylim [0, 1.0]  plt.title 'Loss per Generation'   151   plt.xlabel 'Generation'  plt.ylabel 'Loss'  plt.legend loc='upper right'  plt.show    Figure 2: Computational graph outputs from the network with the sigmoid activation    and a network with the ReLU activation.  The two neural networks work with similar architecture and target  0.75  with two different  activation functions, sigmoid and ReLU. It is important to notice how much quicker the ReLU  activation network converges to the desired target of 0.75 than sigmoid:  Figure 3: This figure depicts the loss value of the sigmoid and the ReLU activation networks.    Notice how extreme the ReLU loss is at the beginning of the iterations.  152   How it works… Because of the form of the ReLU activation function, it returns the value of zero much more  often than the sigmoid function. We consider this behavior as a type of sparsity. This sparsity  results in a speed up of convergence, but a loss of controlled gradients. On the other hand,  the sigmoid function has very well-controlled gradients and does not risk the extreme values  that the ReLU activation does:  Activation function Sigmoid ReLU  Advantages Less extreme outputs Converges quicker  Disadvantages Slower convergence Extreme output values possible  There's more… In this section, we compared the ReLU activation function and the sigmoid activation for  neural networks. There are many other activation functions that are commonly used for neural  networks, but most fall into one of two categories: the first category contains functions that  are shaped like the sigmoid function  arctan, hypertangent, heavyside step, and so on  and  the second category contains functions that are shaped like the ReLU function  softplus,  leaky ReLU, and so on . Most of what was discussed in this section about comparing the two  functions will hold true for activations in either category. However, it is important to note that  the choice of the activation function has a big impact on the convergence and output of the  neural networks.  Implementing a One-Layer Neural Network We have all the tools to implement a neural network that operates on real data. We will create  a neural network with one layer that operates on the Iris dataset.  Getting ready In this section, we will implement a neural network with one hidden layer. It will be important  to understand that a fully connected neural network is based mostly on matrix multiplication.  As such, the dimensions of the data and matrix are very important to get lined up correctly.  Since this is a regression problem, we will use the mean squared error as the loss function.  153   How to do it…  1.  To create the computational graph, we'll start by loading the necessary libraries:  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf from sklearn import datasets  2.  Now we'll load the Iris data and store the pedal length as the target value. Then we'll   start a graph session: iris = datasets.load_iris   x_vals = np.array [x[0:3] for x in iris.data]  y_vals = np.array [x[3] for x in iris.data]  sess = tf.Session    3.  Since the dataset is of a smaller size, we want to set a seed to make the results   reproducible: seed = 2 tf.set_random_seed seed  np.random.seed seed   4.  To prepare the data, we'll create a 80-20 train-test split and normalize the x features   to be between 0 and 1 via min-max scaling: train_indices = np.random.choice len x_vals , round len x_ vals *0.8 , replace=False  test_indices = np.array list set range len x_vals    - set train_ indices    x_vals_train = x_vals[train_indices] x_vals_test = x_vals[test_indices] y_vals_train = y_vals[train_indices] y_vals_test = y_vals[test_indices] def normalize_cols m :     col_max = m.max axis=0      col_min = m.min axis=0      return  m-col_min     col_max - col_min   x_vals_train = np.nan_to_num normalize_cols x_vals_train   x_vals_test = np.nan_to_num normalize_cols x_vals_test    5.  Now we will declare the batch size and placeholders for the data and target:  batch_size = 50 x_data = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 3], dtype=tf.float32  y_target = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32   154   6.  The important part is to declare our model variables with the appropriate shape. We  can declare the size of our hidden layer to be any size we wish; here we set it to have  five hidden nodes: hidden_layer_nodes = 5 A1 = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[3,hidden_layer_nodes]   b1 = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[hidden_layer_nodes]   A2 = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[hidden_layer_nodes,1]   b2 = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1]    7.  We'll now declare our model in two steps. The first step will be creating the hidden   layer output and the second will be creating the final output of the model:  As a note, our model goes from  three features    five hidden nodes    one output value .  hidden_output = tf.nn.relu tf.add tf.matmul x_data, A1 , b1   final_output = tf.nn.relu tf.add tf.matmul hidden_output, A2 ,  b2    8.  Here is our mean squared error as a loss function:  loss = tf.reduce_mean tf.square y_target - final_output    9.  Now we'll declare our optimizing algorithm and initialize our variables:  my_opt = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer 0.005  train_step = my_opt.minimize loss  init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   10.  Next we loop through our training iterations. We'll also initialize two lists that we can   store our train and test loss. In every loop we also want to randomly select a  batch from the training data for fitting to the model:  First we initialize the loss vectors for storage. loss_vec = [] test_loss = [] for i in range 500 :      First we select a random set of indices for the batch.     rand_index = np.random.choice len x_vals_train , size=batch_ size       We then select the training values     rand_x = x_vals_train[rand_index]     rand_y = np.transpose [y_vals_train[rand_index]]       Now we run the training step     sess.run train_step, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_target:   155   rand_y}       We save the training loss     temp_loss = sess.run loss, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_ target: rand_y}      loss_vec.append np.sqrt temp_loss         Finally, we run the test-set loss and save it.     test_temp_loss = sess.run loss, feed_dict={x_data: x_vals_ test, y_target: np.transpose [y_vals_test] }      test_loss.append np.sqrt test_temp_loss       if  i+1 %50==0:         print 'Generation: ' + str i+1  + '. Loss = ' + str temp_ loss    11.  And here is how we can plot the losses with matplotlib:  plt.plot loss_vec, 'k-', label='Train Loss'  plt.plot test_loss, 'r--', label='Test Loss'  plt.title 'Loss  MSE  per Generation'  plt.xlabel 'Generation'  plt.ylabel 'Loss'  plt.legend loc='upper right'  plt.show    Figure 4: We plot the loss  MSE  of the train and test sets. Notice that we are slightly overfitting the model after 200   generations, as the test MSE does not drop any further, but the training MSE does continue to drop.  156   How it works… To visualize our model as a neural network diagram, refer to the following figure:  Figure 5: Here is a visualization of our neural network that has five nodes in the hidden layer. We are feeding in three  values, the sepal length  S.L , the sepal width  S.W. , and the pedal length  P.L. . The target will be the petal width.    In total, there will be 26 total variables in the model.  There's more… Note that we can identify when the model starts overfitting on the training data from viewing  the loss function on the test and train sets. We can also see that the train set loss is  much less smooth than the test set. This is because of two reasons: the first is that we are  using a smaller batch size than the test set, although not by much, and the second is that we  are training on the train set and the test set does not impact the variables of the model.  Implementing Different Layers It is important to know how to implement different layers. In the prior recipe, we implemented  fully connected layers. We will expand our knowledge of various layers in this recipe.  157   Getting ready We have explored how to connect between data inputs and a fully connected hidden layer.  There are more types of layers that are built-in functions inside TensorFlow. The most popular  layers that are used are convolutional layers and maxpool layers. We will show you how to  create and use such layers with input data and with fully connected data. First we will look at  how to use these layers on one-dimensional data, and then on two-dimensional data.  While neural networks can be layered in any fashion, one of the most common uses is to  use convolutional layers and fully connected layers to first create features. If we have too  many features, it is common to have a maxpool layer. After these layers, non-linear layers  are commonly introduced as activation functions. Convolutional neural networks  CNNs ,  which we will consider in Chapter 8, Convolutional Neural Networks, usually have the form  Convolutional, maxpool, activation, convolutional, maxpool, activation, and so on.  How to do it… We will first look at one-dimensional data. We generate a random array of data for this task:  1.  We'll start by loading the libraries we need and starting a graph session:  import tensorflow as tf import numpy as np sess = tf.Session    2.  Now we can initialize our data  NumPy array of length 25  and create the placeholder   that we will feed it through: data_size = 25 data_1d = np.random.normal size=data_size  x_input_1d = tf.placeholder dtype=tf.float32, shape=[data_size]   3.  We will now define a function that will make a convolutional layer. Then we will   declare a random filter and create the convolutional layer:  Note that many of TensorFlow's layer functions are designed to deal with  4D data  4D = [batch size, width, height, channels] . We will need to  modify our input data and the output data to extend or collapse the extra  dimensions needed. For our example data, we have a batch size of 1, a  width of 1, a height of 25, and a channel size of 1. To expand dimensions,  we use the expand_dims   function, and to collapse dimensions, we  use the squeeze   function. Also note that we can calculate the output  dimensions of convolutional layers from the formula output_size= W- F+2P  S+1, where W is the input size, F is the filter size, P is the padding  size, and S is the stride size.  158   def conv_layer_1d input_1d, my_filter :      Make 1d input into 4d     input_2d = tf.expand_dims input_1d, 0      input_3d = tf.expand_dims input_2d, 0      input_4d = tf.expand_dims input_3d, 3       Perform convolution     convolution_output = tf.nn.conv2d input_4d, filter=my_filter,  strides=[1,1,1,1], padding="VALID"       Now drop extra dimensions     conv_output_1d = tf.squeeze convolution_output      return conv_output_1d   my_filter = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1,5,1,1]   my_convolution_output = conv_layer_1d x_input_1d, my_filter   4.  TensorFlow's activation functions will act element-wise by default. This means we just  have to call our activation function on the layer of interest. We do this by creating an  activation function and then initializing it on the graph: def activation input_1d :     return tf.nn.relu input_1d   my_activation_output = activation my_convolution_output   5.  Now we'll declare a maxpool layer function. This function will create a maxpool on a  moving window across our one-dimensional vector. For this example, we will initialize  it to have a width of 5:  TensorFlow's maxpool arguments are very similar to the convolutional layer.  While it does not have a filter, it does have a size, stride, and padding option.  Since we have a window of 5 with valid padding  no zero padding , then our  output array will have 4 or    less entries.  def max_pool input_1d, width :      First we make the 1d input into 4d.     input_2d = tf.expand_dims input_1d, 0      input_3d = tf.expand_dims input_2d, 0      input_4d = tf.expand_dims input_3d, 3       Perform the max pool operation     pool_output = tf.nn.max_pool input_4d, ksize=[1, 1, width, 1],  strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='VALID'      pool_output_1d = tf.squeeze pool_output      return pool_output_1d  my_maxpool_output = max_pool my_activation_output, width=5   159   6.  The final layer that we will connect is the fully connected layer. We want to create a   versatile function that inputs a 1D array and outputs the number of values indicated.  Also remember that to do matrix multiplication with a 1D array, we must expand the  dimensions into 2D: def fully_connected input_layer, num_outputs :      Create weights     weight_shape = tf.squeeze tf.pack [tf.shape input_layer ,  [num_outputs]]       weight = tf.random_normal weight_shape, stddev=0.1      bias = tf.random_normal shape=[num_outputs]       Make input into 2d     input_layer_2d = tf.expand_dims input_layer, 0       Perform fully connected operations     full_output = tf.add tf.matmul input_layer_2d, weight , bias       Drop extra dimensions     full_output_1d = tf.squeeze full_output      return full_output_1d   my_full_output = fully_connected my_maxpool_output, 5   7.  Now we'll initialize all the variables and run the graph and print the output of each of   the layers: init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init  feed_dict = {x_input_1d: data_1d}  Convolution Output print 'Input = array of length 25''  print 'Convolution w filter, length = 5, stride size = 1, results  in an array of length 21:''  print sess.run my_convolution_output, feed_dict=feed_dict    Activation Output print '\nInput = the above array of length 21''  print 'ReLU element wise returns the array of length 21:''  print sess.run my_activation_output, feed_dict=feed_dict    Maxpool Output print '\nInput = the above array of length 21''  print 'MaxPool, window length = 5, stride size = 1, results in the  array of length 17:''  print sess.run my_maxpool_output, feed_dict=feed_dict    Fully Connected Output print '\nInput = the above array of length 17''  print 'Fully connected layer on all four rows with five  outputs:''  print sess.run my_full_output, feed_dict=feed_dict    160   8.  This results in the following output: Input = array of length 25 Convolution w filter, length = 5, stride size = 1, results in an  array of length 21: [-0.91608119  1.53731811 -0.7954089   0.5041104   1.88933098   -1.81099761  0.56695032  1.17945457 -0.66252393 -1.90287709   0.87184119  0.84611893 -5.25024986 -0.05473572  2.19293165  -4.47577858 -1.71364677  3.96857905 -2.0452652  -1.86647367  -0.12697852] Input = the above array of length 21 ReLU element wise returns the array of length 21: [ 0.          1.53731811  0.          0.5041104   1.88933098   0.          0.          1.17945457  0.          0.            0.87184119  0.84611893  0.          0.          2.19293165   0.          0.          3.96857905  0.          0.           0.         ] Input = the above array of length 21 MaxPool, window length = 5, stride size = 1, results in the array  of length 17: [ 1.88933098  1.88933098  1.88933098  1.88933098  1.88933098    1.17945457  1.17945457  1.17945457  0.87184119  0.87184119    2.19293165  2.19293165  2.19293165  3.96857905  3.96857905     3.96857905  3.96857905] Input = the above array of length 17 Fully connected layer on all four rows with five outputs: [ 1.23588216 -0.42116445  1.44521213  1.40348077 -0.79607368]  One-dimensional data is very important to consider for neural  networks. Time series, signal processing, and some text embeddings  are considered to be one-dimensional and are frequently used in  neural networks.  We will now consider the same types of layers in an equivalent order but for two-dimensional  data:  1.  We will start by clearing and resetting the computational graph:  ops.reset_default_graph   sess = tf.Session    2.  First of all, we will initialize our input array to be a 10x10 matrix, and then we will   initialize a placeholder for the graph with the same shape: data_size = [10,10]  161   data_2d = np.random.normal size=data_size  x_input_2d = tf.placeholder dtype=tf.float32, shape=data_size   3.  Just as in the one-dimensional example, we declare a convolutional layer function.   Since our data has a height and width already, we just need to expand it in two  dimensions  a batch size of 1, and a channel size of 1  so that we can operate on it  with the conv2d   function. For the filter, we will use a random 2x2 filter, stride two  in both directions, and use valid padding  no zero padding . Because our input matrix  is 10x10, our convolutional output will be 5x5: def conv_layer_2d input_2d, my_filter :      First, change 2d input to 4d     input_3d = tf.expand_dims input_2d, 0      input_4d = tf.expand_dims input_3d, 3       Perform convolution     convolution_output = tf.nn.conv2d input_4d, filter=my_filter,  strides=[1,2,2,1], padding="VALID"       Drop extra dimensions     conv_output_2d = tf.squeeze convolution_output      return conv_output_2d   my_filter = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[2,2,1,1]   my_convolution_output = conv_layer_2d x_input_2d, my_filter   4.  The activation function works on an element-wise basis, so now we can create an   activation operation and initialize it on the graph: def activation input_2d :     return tf.nn.relu input_2d   my_activation_output = activation my_convolution_output   5.  Our maxpool layer is very similar to the one-dimensional case except we have to   declare a width and height for the maxpool window. Just like our convolutional 2D  layer, we only have to expand our into in two dimensions this time: def max_pool input_2d, width, height :      Make 2d input into 4d     input_3d = tf.expand_dims input_2d, 0      input_4d = tf.expand_dims input_3d, 3       Perform max pool     pool_output = tf.nn.max_pool input_4d, ksize=[1, height,  width, 1], strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='VALID'       Drop extra dimensions     pool_output_2d = tf.squeeze pool_output      return pool_output_2d   my_maxpool_output = max_pool my_activation_output, width=2,  height=2   162   6.  Our fully connected layer is very similar to the one-dimensional output. We should   also note here that the 2D input to this layer is considered as one object, so we  want each of the entries connected to each of the outputs. In order to accomplish  this, we fully flatten out the two-dimensional matrix and then expand it for matrix  multiplication: def fully_connected input_layer, num_outputs :      Flatten into 1d     flat_input = tf.reshape input_layer, [-1]       Create weights     weight_shape = tf.squeeze tf.pack [tf.shape flat_input , [num_ outputs]]       weight = tf.random_normal weight_shape, stddev=0.1      bias = tf.random_normal shape=[num_outputs]       Change into 2d     input_2d = tf.expand_dims flat_input, 0       Perform fully connected operations     full_output = tf.add tf.matmul input_2d, weight , bias       Drop extra dimensions     full_output_2d = tf.squeeze full_output      return full_output_2d   my_full_output = fully_connected my_maxpool_output, 5   7.  We'll now initialize our variables and create a feed dictionary for our operations:  init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   feed_dict = {x_input_2d: data_2d}  8.  And here is how we can see the outputs for each of the layers:   Convolution Output print 'Input = [10 X 10] array''  print '2x2 Convolution, stride size = [2x2], results in the [5x5]  array:''  print sess.run my_convolution_output, feed_dict=feed_dict    Activation Output print '\nInput = the above [5x5] array''  print 'ReLU element wise returns the [5x5] array:''  print sess.run my_activation_output, feed_dict=feed_dict    Max Pool Output print '\nInput = the above [5x5] array''  print 'MaxPool, stride size = [1x1], results in the [4x4]  array:''  print sess.run my_maxpool_output, feed_dict=feed_dict    163    Fully Connected Output print '\nInput = the above [4x4] array''  print 'Fully connected layer on all four rows with five  outputs:''  print sess.run my_full_output, feed_dict=feed_dict    9.  This results in the following output:  Input = [10 X 10] array 2x2 Convolution, stride size = [2x2], results in the [5x5] array: [[ 0.37630892 -1.41018617 -2.58821273 -0.32302785  1.18970704]  [-4.33685207  1.97415686  1.0844903  -1.18965471  0.84643292]  [ 5.23706436  2.46556497 -0.95119286  1.17715418  4.1117816 ]  [ 5.86972761  1.2213701   1.59536231  2.66231227  2.28650784]  [-0.88964868 -2.75502229  4.3449688   2.67776585 -2.23714781]] Input = the above [5x5] array ReLU element wise returns the [5x5] array: [[ 0.37630892  0.          0.          0.          1.18970704]  [ 0.          1.97415686  1.0844903   0.          0.84643292]  [ 5.23706436  2.46556497  0.          1.17715418  4.1117816 ]  [ 5.86972761  1.2213701   1.59536231  2.66231227  2.28650784]  [ 0.          0.          4.3449688   2.67776585  0.        ]] Input = the above [5x5] array MaxPool, stride size = [1x1], results in the [4x4] array: [[ 1.97415686  1.97415686  1.0844903   1.18970704]  [ 5.23706436  2.46556497  1.17715418  4.1117816 ]  [ 5.86972761  2.46556497  2.66231227  4.1117816 ]  [ 5.86972761  4.3449688   4.3449688   2.67776585]] Input = the above [4x4] array Fully connected layer on all four rows with five outputs: [-0.6154139  -1.96987963 -1.88811922  0.20010889  0.32519674]  How it works… We can now see how to use the convolutional and maxpool layers in TensorFlow with one- dimensional and two-dimensional data. Regardless of the shape of the input, we ended up  with the same size output. This is important to illustrate the flexibility of neural network layers.  This section should also impress upon us again the importance of shapes and sizes in neural  network operations.  Using a Multilayer Neural Network We will now apply our knowledge of different layers to real data with using a multilayer neural  network on the Low Birthweight dataset.  164   Getting ready Now that we know how to create neural networks and work with layers, we will apply this  methodology towards predicting the birthweight in the low birthweight dataset. We'll create  a neural network with three hidden layers. The low- birthweight dataset includes the actual  birthweight and an indicator variable if the birthweight is above or below 2,500 grams. In  this example, we'll make the target the actual birthweight  regression  and then see what  the accuracy is on the classification at the end, and let's see if our model can identify if the  birthweight will be <2,500 grams.  How to do it…  1.  First we'll start by loading the libraries and initializing our computational graph:  import tensorflow as tf import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import requests import numpy as np sess = tf.Session    2.  Now we'll load the data from the website using the requests module. After this, we   will split the data into the features of interest and the target value: birthdata_url = 'https:  www.umass.edu statdata statdata data  lowbwt.dat' birth_file = requests.get birthdata_url  birth_data = birth_file.text.split '\r\n' [5:] birth_header = [x for x in birth_data[0].split ' '  if len x >=1] birth_data = [[float x  for x in y.split ' '  if len x >=1] for y  in birth_data[1:] if len y >=1] y_vals = np.array [x[10] for x in birth_data]  cols_of_interest = ['AGE', 'LWT', 'RACE', 'SMOKE', 'PTL', 'HT',  'UI', 'FTV'] x_vals = np.array [[x[ix] for ix, feature in enumerate birth_ header  if feature in cols_of_interest] for x in birth_data]   3.  To help with repeatability, we set the random seed for both NumPy and TensorFlow.   Then we declare our batch size: seed = 3 tf.set_random_seed seed  np.random.seed seed  batch_size = 100  4.  Next we'll split the data into an 80-20 train-test split. After this, we will normalize our   input features to be between zero and one with a min-max scaling: train_indices = np.random.choice len x_vals , round len x_  165   vals *0.8 , replace=False  test_indices = np.array list set range len x_vals    - set train_ indices    x_vals_train = x_vals[train_indices] x_vals_test = x_vals[test_indices] y_vals_train = y_vals[train_indices] y_vals_test = y_vals[test_indices]  def normalize_cols m :     col_max = m.max axis=0      col_min = m.min axis=0      return  m-col_min     col_max - col_min   x_vals_train = np.nan_to_num normalize_cols x_vals_train   x_vals_test = np.nan_to_num normalize_cols x_vals_test    Normalizing input features is a common feature transformation,  and especially useful for neural networks. It will help convergence  if our data is centered near zero to one for the activation functions  to operate on.  5.  Since we will have multiple layers that have similar initialized variables, we will create   a function to initialize both the weights and the bias: def init_weight shape, st_dev :     weight = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape, stddev=st_dev       return weight   def init_bias shape, st_dev :     bias = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape, stddev=st_dev       return bias   6.  We'll initialize our placeholders next. There will be eight input features and one   output, the birthweight in grams: x_data = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 8], dtype=tf.float32  y_target = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32   7.  The fully connected layer will be used three times for all three hidden layers. To   prevent repeated code, we will create a layer function to use when we initialize our  model: def fully_connected input_layer, weights, biases :     layer = tf.add tf.matmul input_layer, weights , biases      return tf.nn.relu layer    166   8.  We'll now create our model. For each layer  and output layer , we will initialize a   weight matrix, bias matrix, and the fully connected layer. For this example, we will use  hidden layers of sizes 25, 10, and 3:  The model that we are using will have 522 variables to fit. To arrive at this  number, we can see that between the data and the first hidden layer we have  8*25+25=225 variables. If we continue in this way and add them up, we'll  have 225+260+33+4=522 variables. This is significantly larger than the  nine variables that we used in the logistic regression model on this data.   Create second layer  25 hidden nodes  weight_1 = init_weight shape=[8, 25], st_dev=10.0  bias_1 = init_bias shape=[25], st_dev=10.0  layer_1 = fully_connected x_data, weight_1, bias_1    Create second layer  10 hidden nodes  weight_2 = init_weight shape=[25, 10], st_dev=10.0  bias_2 = init_bias shape=[10], st_dev=10.0  layer_2 = fully_connected layer_1, weight_2, bias_2    Create third layer  3 hidden nodes  weight_3 = init_weight shape=[10, 3], st_dev=10.0  bias_3 = init_bias shape=[3], st_dev=10.0  layer_3 = fully_connected layer_2, weight_3, bias_3   Create output layer  1 output value   weight_4 = init_weight shape=[3, 1], st_dev=10.0   bias_4 = init_bias shape=[1], st_dev=10.0  final_output = fully_connected layer_3, weight_4, bias_4   9.  We'll now use the L1 loss function  absolute value , declare our optimizer  Adam   optimization , and initialize our variables: loss = tf.reduce_mean tf.abs y_target - final_output   my_opt = tf.train.AdamOptimizer 0.05  train_step = my_opt.minimize loss  init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   While the learning rate we use here for the Adam optimization function  is 0.05, there is research that suggests a lower learning rate consistently  produces better results. For this recipe, we use a larger learning rate because  of the consistency of the data and the need for quick convergence.  167   10.  Next we will train our model for 200 iterations. We'll also include code that will store  the train and test loss, select a random batch size, and print the status every 25  generations:  Initialize the loss vectors loss_vec = [] test_loss = [] for i in range 200 :      Choose random indices for batch selection     rand_index = np.random.choice len x_vals_train , size=batch_ size       Get random batch     rand_x = x_vals_train[rand_index]     rand_y = np.transpose [y_vals_train[rand_index]]       Run the training step     sess.run train_step, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_target:  rand_y}       Get and store the train loss     temp_loss = sess.run loss, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_ target: rand_y}      loss_vec.append temp_loss       Get and store the test loss     test_temp_loss = sess.run loss, feed_dict={x_data: x_vals_ test, y_target: np.transpose [y_vals_test] }      test_loss.append test_temp_loss      if  i+1 %25==0:         print 'Generation: ' + str i+1  + '. Loss = ' + str temp_ loss    11.  This results in the following output:  Generation: 25. Loss = 5922.52 Generation: 50. Loss = 2861.66 Generation: 75. Loss = 2342.01 Generation: 100. Loss = 1880.59 Generation: 125. Loss = 1394.39 Generation: 150. Loss = 1062.43 Generation: 175. Loss = 834.641 Generation: 200. Loss = 848.54  12. Here is a snippet of code that plots the train and test loss with matplotlib:  plt.plot loss_vec, 'k-', label='Train Loss'  plt.plot test_loss, 'r--', label='Test Loss'  plt.title 'Loss per Generation'   168   plt.xlabel 'Generation'  plt.ylabel 'Loss'  plt.legend loc='upper right'  plt.show    Figure 6: Here we plot the train and test loss for our neural network that we trained to predict the birthweight in   grams. Notice that only after about 30 generations we have arrived at a good model.  13.  Now we want to compare our birthweight results to our prior logistic results. In logistic   linear regression  see the Implementing Logistic Regression recipe in Chapter 3,  Linear Regression , we achieved around 60% accuracy after thousands of iterations.  To compare this with what we have done here, we will output the train test regression  results and turn them into classification results by creating an indicator if they are  above or below 2,500 grams. Here is the code to arrive find out what this model's  accuracy is likely to be: actuals = np.array [x[1] for x in birth_data]  test_actuals = actuals[test_indices] train_actuals = actuals[train_indices] test_preds = [x[0] for x in sess.run final_output, feed_dict={x_ data: x_vals_test} ] train_preds = [x[0] for x in sess.run final_output, feed_dict={x_ data: x_vals_train} ] test_preds = np.array [1.0 if x<2500.0 else 0.0 for x in test_ preds]   169   train_preds = np.array [1.0 if x<2500.0 else 0.0 for x in train_ preds]   Print out accuracies test_acc = np.mean [x==y for x,y in zip test_preds, test_ actuals ]  train_acc = np.mean [x==y for x,y in zip train_preds, train_ actuals ]  print 'On predicting the category of low birthweight from  regression output  <2500g :''  print 'Test Accuracy: {}''.format test_acc   print 'Train Accuracy: {}''.format train_acc    14.  This results in the following output:  Test Accuracy: 0.5526315789473685 Train Accuracy: 0.6688741721854304  How it works… In this recipe, we created a regression neural network with three fully connected hidden layers  to predict the birthweight of the low-birthweight data set. When comparing this to a logistic  output to predict above or below 2,500 grams, we achieved similar results and achieved them  in fewer generations. In the next recipe, we will try to improve our logistic regression by making  it a multiple-layer logistic-type neural network.  Improving the Predictions of Linear Models In the prior recipes, we have noted that the number of parameters we are fitting far exceeds  the equivalent linear models. In this recipe, we will attempt to improve our logistic model of  low birthweight with using a neural network.  Getting ready For this recipe, we will load the low birth-weight data and use a neural network with two  hidden fully connected layers with sigmoid activations to fit the probability of a low birth- weight.  How to do it  1.  We start by loading the libraries and initializing our computational graph:  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np  170   import tensorflow as tf import requests sess = tf.Session    2.  Now we will load, extract, and normalize our data just like as in the prior recipe,   except that we are going to using the low birthweight indicator variable as our target  instead of the actual birthweight: birthdata_url = 'https:  www.umass.edu statdata statdata data  lowbwt.dat'' birth_file = requests.get birthdata_url  birth_data = birth_file.text.split '\r\n'' [5:] birth_header = [x for x in birth_data[0].split ' ''  if len x >=1] birth_data = [[float x  for x in y.split ' ''  if len x >=1] for y  in birth_data[1:] if len y >=1] y_vals = np.array [x[1] for x in birth_data]  x_vals = np.array [x[2:9] for x in birth_data]  train_indices = np.random.choice len x_vals , round len x_ vals *0.8 , replace=False  test_indices = np.array list set range len x_vals    - set train_ indices    x_vals_train = x_vals[train_indices] x_vals_test = x_vals[test_indices] y_vals_train = y_vals[train_indices] y_vals_test = y_vals[test_indices]  def normalize_cols m :     col_max = m.max axis=0      col_min = m.min axis=0      return  m-col_min     col_max - col_min   x_vals_train = np.nan_to_num normalize_cols x_vals_train   x_vals_test = np.nan_to_num normalize_cols x_vals_test    3.  Next we'll declare our batch size and our placeholders for the data:  batch_size = 90 x_data = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 7], dtype=tf.float32  y_target = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32   171   4.  Just as before, we will declare functions that initialize a variable and a layer in our   model. To create a better logistic function, we need to create a function that returns a  logistic layer on an input layer. In other words, we will just use a fully connected layer  and return a sigmoid element-wise for each layer. It is important to remember that  our loss function will have the final sigmoid included, so we want to specify on our  last layer that we will not return the sigmoid of the output: def init_variable shape :     return tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=shape     Create a logistic layer definition def logistic input_layer, multiplication_weight, bias_weight,  activation = True :     linear_layer = tf.add tf.matmul input_layer, multiplication_ weight , bias_weight       if activation:         return tf.nn.sigmoid linear_layer       else:         return linear_layer   5.  Now we will declare three layers  two hidden layers and an output layer .  We will  start by initializing a weight and bias matrix for each layer and defining the layer  operations:  First logistic layer  7 inputs to 14 hidden nodes  A1 = init_variable shape=[7,14]  b1 = init_variable shape=[14]  logistic_layer1 = logistic x_data, A1, b1   Second logistic layer  14 hidden inputs to 5 hidden nodes  A2 = init_variable shape=[14,5]  b2 = init_variable shape=[5]  logistic_layer2 = logistic logistic_layer1, A2, b2   Final output layer  5 hidden nodes to 1 output  A3 = init_variable shape=[5,1]  b3 = init_variable shape=[1]  final_output = logistic logistic_layer2, A3, b3, activation=False   6.  Next we declare our loss function  cross-entropy  and optimization algorithm, and   initialize the variables:  Create loss function loss = tf.reduce_mean tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits   final_output, y_target    Declare optimizer my_opt = tf.train.AdamOptimizer learning_rate = 0.002  train_step = my_opt.minimize loss   172    Initialize variables init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   Cross-entropy is a way to measure distances between probabilities.  Here we want to measure the difference between certainty  0 or 1  and  our model probability  0<x<1 . TensorFlow implements cross entropy  with the sigmoid function built in. Also, it is important as part of the  hyperparameter tuning to find the best loss function, learning rate, and  optimization algorithm for the problem at hand. For brevity in this recipe,  we do not include hyperparameter tuning.  7.   In order to evaluate and compare our model to prior models, we want to create a  prediction and accuracy operation on the graph. This will allow us to feed in the whole  test set and determine the accuracy: prediction = tf.round tf.nn.sigmoid final_output   predictions_correct = tf.cast tf.equal prediction, y_target ,  tf.float32  accuracy = tf.reduce_mean predictions_correct   8.  Now we are ready to start our training loop. We will train for 1500 generations and   save the model loss and train test accuracies for plotting later:  Initialize loss and accuracy vectors loss_vec = [] train_acc = [] test_acc = [] for i in range 1500 :      Select random indicies for batch selection     rand_index = np.random.choice len x_vals_train , size=batch_ size       Select batch     rand_x = x_vals_train[rand_index]     rand_y = np.transpose [y_vals_train[rand_index]]       Run training step     sess.run train_step, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_target:  rand_y}       Get training loss     temp_loss = sess.run loss, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_ target: rand_y}      loss_vec.append temp_loss       Get training accuracy  173       temp_acc_train = sess.run accuracy, feed_dict={x_data: x_vals_ train, y_target: np.transpose [y_vals_train] }      train_acc.append temp_acc_train       Get test accuracy     temp_acc_test = sess.run accuracy, feed_dict={x_data: x_vals_ test, y_target: np.transpose [y_vals_test] }      test_acc.append temp_acc_test      if  i+1 %150==0:         print 'Loss = '' + str temp_loss    9.  This results in the following output:  Loss = 0.696393 Loss = 0.591708 Loss = 0.59214 Loss = 0.505553 Loss = 0.541974 Loss = 0.512707 Loss = 0.590149 Loss = 0.502641 Loss = 0.518047 Loss = 0.502616  174  10.  The following code blocks illustrate how to plot the cross entropy loss and the train   and test set accuracies with matplotlib:  Plot loss over time plt.plot loss_vec, 'k-''  plt.title 'Cross Entropy Loss per Generation''  plt.xlabel 'Generation''  plt.ylabel 'Cross Entropy Loss''  plt.show    Plot train and test accuracy plt.plot train_acc, 'k-'', label=''Train Set Accuracy''  plt.plot test_acc, 'r--'', label=''Test Set Accuracy''  plt.title 'Train and Test Accuracy''  plt.xlabel 'Generation''  plt.ylabel 'Accuracy''  plt.legend loc='lower right''  plt.show     Figure 7: Training loss over 1,500 iterations.  Within approximately 50 generations, we have reached a good model. As we continue to train,  we can see that very little is gained over the remaining iterations:  Figure 8: Accuracy for the train set and test set.  Here we can see that we arrived at a good model very quickly.  How it works… When considering using neural networks to model data, we have to consider the advantages  and disadvantages. While our model has converged faster than prior models and is maybe a  bit more accurate in some cases, this comes with a price: we are training many more model  variables and have a greater chance of overfitting. To see overfitting occurring, we look at  the accuracy of the test and train sets and see the accuracy of the training set continue to  increase slightly, while the accuracy on the test set stays the same or even decreases slightly.  175   To combat underfitting, we can increase our model depth or train the model for more  iterations. To address overfitting, we can add more data or add regularization techniques to  our model.  It is also important to note that our model variables are not as interpretable as a linear model.  Neural network models have coefficients that are harder to interpret than linear models as it  pertains to explaining the significance of features in the model.  Learning to Play Tic Tac Toe To show how adaptable neural networks can be, we will attempt to use a neural network to  learn the optimal moves of Tic Tac Toe. We will approach this knowing that Tic Tac Toe is a  deterministic game and that the optimal moves are already known.  Getting ready To train our model, we will have a list of board positions followed by the best optimal   response for a number of different boards. We can reduce the amount of boards to train   on by considering only board positions that are different with respect to symmetries. The   non-identity transformations of a Tic Tac Toe board are a rotation  either direction  by  90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, a horizontal reflection, and a vertical reflection.  Given this idea, we will use a shortlist of boards with the optimal move, apply two random  transformations, and feed that into our neural network to learn.  Since tic-tac-toe is a deterministic game, it is worth noting that whoever  goes first should either win or draw. We will hope for a model that can  respond to our moves optimally and result in a draw.  If we annotate Xs by 1, Os by -1, and empty spaces by zero, then the following shows us how  we can consider a board position and optimal move as a row of data:  176   Figure 9: Here we illustrate how to consider a board and optimal move as a row of data.    Note that X = 1, O = -1, and empty spaces are 0, and we start indexing at 0.  In addition to the model loss, to check how our model is performing, we will do two things.  The first check we will perform is to remove a position and optimal move row from our training  set. This will allow us to see whether the neural network model can generalize out to a move it  hasn't seen before. The second method we will take to evaluate our model is to actually play a  game against it at the end.  The list of possible boards and optimal moves can be found on the GitHub directory for  this recipe here: https:  github.com nfmcclure tensorflow_cookbook tree  master 06_Neural_Networks 08_Learning_Tic_Tac_Toe.  How to do it…  1.  We will start by loading the necessary libraries for this script:  import tensorflow as tf import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import csv import random import numpy as np import random  2.  Next we declare our batch size for training our model:  batch_size = 50  177   3.  To make visualizing the boards a bit easier, we will create a function that outputs the   Tic Tac Toe boards with Xs and Os: def print_board board :     symbols = ['O',' ','X']     board_plus1 = [int x  + 1 for x in board]     print ' ' + symbols[board_plus1[0]] + '  ' + symbols[board_ plus1[1]] + '  ' + symbols[board_plus1[2]]      print '___________'      print ' ' + symbols[board_plus1[3]] + '  ' + symbols[board_ plus1[4]] + '  ' + symbols[board_plus1[5]]      print '___________'      print ' ' + symbols[board_plus1[6]] + '  ' + symbols[board_ plus1[7]] + '  ' + symbols[board_plus1[8]]   4.  Now we have to create a function that will return a new board and optimal response   position under a transformation: def get_symmetry board, response, transformation :     '''     :param board: list of integers 9 long:      opposing mark = -1      friendly mark = 1      empty space = 0     :param transformation: one of five transformations on a board:      rotate180, rotate90, rotate270, flip_v, flip_h     :return: tuple:  new_board, new_response      '''      if transformation == 'rotate180':         new_response = 8 - response         return board[::-1], new_response       elif transformation == 'rotate90':         new_response = [6, 3, 0, 7, 4, 1, 8, 5, 2].index response          tuple_board = list zip *[board[6:9], board[3:6],  board[0:3]]           return [value for item in tuple_board for value in item],  new_response       elif transformation == 'rotate270':         new_response = [2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6].index response          tuple_board = list zip *[board[0:3], board[3:6],  board[6:9]]  [::-1]  178           return [value for item in tuple_board for value in item],  new_response       elif transformation == 'flip_v':         new_response = [6, 7, 8, 3, 4, 5, 0, 1, 2].index response          return board[6:9] +  board[3:6] + board[0:3], new_ response       elif transformation == 'flip_h':      flip_h = rotate180, then flip_v         new_response = [2, 1, 0, 5, 4, 3, 8, 7, 6].index response          new_board = board[::-1]         return new_board[6:9] +  new_board[3:6] + new_board[0:3],  new_response       else:         raise ValueError 'Method not implmented.'   5.  The list of boards and their optimal response is in a .csv file in the directory. We will   create a function that will load the file with the f boards and responses and store it as  a list of tuples: def get_moves_from_csv csv_file :     '''     :param csv_file: csv file location containing the boards w   responses     :return: moves: list of moves with index of best response     '''     moves = []     with open csv_file, 'rt'  as csvfile:         reader = csv.reader csvfile, delimiter=','          for row in reader:             moves.append  [int x  for x in row[0:9]],int row[9]        return moves   6.  Now we'll tie everything together to create a function that will return a randomly   transformed board and response: def get_rand_move moves, rand_transforms=2 :      This function performs random transformations on a board.      board, response  = random.choice moves      possible_transforms = ['rotate90', 'rotate180', 'rotate270',  'flip_v', 'flip_h']     for i in range rand_transforms :         random_transform = random.choice possible_transforms   179            board, response  = get_symmetry board, response, random_ transform      return board, response   7.  Next we'll initialize our graph session, load our data, and create a training set:  sess = tf.Session   moves = get_moves_from_csv 'base_tic_tac_toe_moves.csv'   Create a train set: train_length = 500 train_set = [] for t in range train_length :     train_set.append get_rand_move moves    8.  Remember that we want to remove one board and optimal response from our training   set to see whether the model can generalize out to make the best move. The best  move for the following board will be to play at index number six: test_board = [-1, 0, 0, 1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 1] train_set = [x for x in train_set if x[0] != test_board]  9.  We can now create functions to create our model variables and our model operations.  Note that we do not include the softmax   activation function in the model because  it is included in the loss function: def init_weights shape :     return tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape     def model X, A1, A2, bias1, bias2 :     layer1 = tf.nn.sigmoid tf.add tf.matmul X, A1 , bias1       layer2 = tf.add tf.matmul layer1, A2 , bias2      return layer2   10.  Now we will declare our placeholders, variables, and model:  X = tf.placeholder dtype=tf.float32, shape=[None, 9]  Y = tf.placeholder dtype=tf.int32, shape=[None]  A1 = init_weights [9, 81]  bias1 = init_weights [81]  A2 = init_weights [81, 9]  bias2 = init_weights [9]  model_output = model X, A1, A2, bias1, bias2   180   11.  Next we'll declare our loss function, which will be the average softmax of the final  output logits. Then we will declare our training step and optimizer. We also need to  create a prediction operation if we want to be able to play against our model in the  future: loss = tf.reduce_mean  tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_ logits model_output, Y   train_step = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer 0.025 . minimize loss  prediction = tf.argmax model_output, 1   12. We can now initialize our variables and loop through the training of our neural   network:  Initialize variables init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init  loss_vec = [] for i in range 10000 :      Select random indices for batch     rand_indices = np.random.choice range len train_set  , batch_ size, replace=False       Get batch     batch_data = [train_set[i] for i in rand_indices]     x_input = [x[0] for x in batch_data]     y_target = np.array [y[1] for y in batch_data]       Run training step     sess.run train_step, feed_dict={X: x_input, Y: y_target}       Get training loss     temp_loss = sess.run loss, feed_dict={X: x_input, Y: y_ target}      loss_vec.append temp_loss      if i%500==0:         print 'iteration ' + str i  + ' Loss: ' + str temp_loss    13.  Here is code to plot the loss over the model training:  plt.plot loss_vec, 'k-', label='Loss'  plt.title 'Loss  MSE  per Generation'   181   plt.xlabel 'Generation'  plt.ylabel 'Loss'  plt.show    Figure 10: Tic-Tac-Toe train set loss over 10,000 iterations.  Here we plot the loss over the training steps:  1.  To test the model, we see how it performs on the test board that we removed    from the training set. We are hoping that the model can generalize and predict the  optimal index for moving, which will be the index six. Most of the time, the model will  succeed here: test_boards = [test_board] feed_dict = {X: test_boards} logits = sess.run model_output, feed_dict=feed_dict  predictions = sess.run prediction, feed_dict=feed_dict  print predictions   2.  This results in the following output:  [6]  3.   In order to evaluate our model, we planned to play against our trained model. To do  this, we have to create a function that will check for a win. This way, our program will  know when to stop asking for more moves: def check board :     wins = [[0,1,2], [3,4,5], [6,7,8], [0,3,6], [1,4,7], [2,5,8],  [0,4,8], [2,4,6]]     for i in range len wins  :         if board[wins[i][0]]==board[wins[i][1]]==board[wins[i] [2]]==1.:             return 1   182           elif board[wins[i][0]]==board[wins[i][1]]==board[wins[i] [2]]==-1.:             return 1      return 0   4.  Now we can loop through and play a game with our model. We start with a blank   board  all zeros , and then we ask the user to input an index  0-8  of where to play  and then feed that into the model for a prediction. For the model's move, we take the  largest available prediction that is also an open space. A sample game is shown at  the end. From this game, we can see that our model is not perfect: game_tracker = [0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.] win_logical = False num_moves = 0 while not win_logical:     player_index = input 'Input index of your move  0-8 : '      num_moves += 1      Add player move to game     game_tracker[int player_index ] = 1.           Get model's move by first getting all the logits for each  index     [potential_moves] = sess.run model_output, feed_dict={X:  [game_tracker]}       Now find allowed moves  where game tracker values = 0.0      allowed_moves = [ix for ix,x in enumerate game_tracker  if  x==0.0]      Find best move by taking argmax of logits if they are in  allowed moves     model_move = np.argmax [x if ix in allowed_moves else -999.0  for ix,x in enumerate potential_moves ]            Add model move to game     game_tracker[int model_move ] = -1.     print 'Model has moved'      print_board game_tracker       Now check for win or too many moves     if check game_tracker ==1 or num_moves>=5:         print 'Game Over!'          win_logical = True  183   5.  This results in the following interactive output:  Input index of your move  0-8 : 4 Model has moved  O       ___________     X    ___________           Input index of your move  0-8 : 6 Model has moved  O       ___________     X    ___________  X     O  Input index of your move  0-8 : 2 Model has moved  O     X ___________  O  X    ___________  X     O Game Over!  How it works… We trained a neural network to play tic-tac-toe by feeding in board positions, a nine-dimensional  vector, and predicted the optimal response. We only had to feed in a few possible Tic Tac Toe  boards and apply random transformations to each board to increase the training set size.  To test our algorithm, we removed all instances of one specific board and saw whether our  model could generalize to predict the optimal response. Finally, we also played a sample  game against our model. While it is not perfect yet, we could still try different architectures  and training procedures to improve it.  184   Natural Language  Processing  Here we will cover an introduction to working with text in TensorFlow. We start by  introducing how word embeddings work and using the bag of words method, then we  move on to implementing more advanced embeddings such as Word2vec and Doc2vec:   f Working with bag of words  f Implementing TF-IDF  f Working with Skip-gram Embeddings  f Working with CBOW Embeddings  f Making Predictions with Word2vec  f Using Doc2vec for Sentiment Analysis  As a note, the reader may find all the code for this chapter online at https:  github. com nfmcclure tensorflow_cookbook.  Introduction Up to this point, we have only considered machine learning algorithms that mostly operate on  numerical inputs. If we want to use text, we must find a way to convert the text into numbers.  There are many ways to do this and we will explore a few common ways this is achieved.  7  185   If we consider the sentence TensorFlow makes machine learning easy, we could convert the  words to numbers in the order that we observe them. This would make the sentence become  1 2 3 4 5. Then when we see a new sentence, machine learning is easy, we can translate this  as 3 4 0 5, denoting words we haven't seen with an index of zero. With these two examples,  we have limited our vocabulary to six numbers. With large texts, we can choose how many  words we want to keep, and usually keep the most frequent words, labeling everything else  with the index of zero.  If the word learning has a numerical value of 4, and the word makes has a numerical value  of 2, then it would be natural to assume that learning is twice makes. Since we do not want  this type of numerical relationship between words, we assume these numbers represent  categories and not relational numbers.  Another problem is that these two sentences are of different sizes. Each observation we make   sentences in this case  needs to have the same size input to the model we wish to create. To  get around this, we create each sentence into a sparse vector that has the value of one in a  specific index if that word occurs in that index:  TensorFlow 1  makes 2  machine 3  learning 4  easy 5   first_sentence = [0,1,1,1,1,1]  machine 3  learning 4  is 0  easy 5  second_sentence = [1,0,0,1,1,1]  A disadvantage to this method is that we lose any indication of word order. The two sentences  TensorFlow makes machine learning easy and machine learning makes TensorFlow easy  would result in the same sentence vector.  It is also worthwhile to note that the length of these vectors is equal to the size of our  vocabulary that we pick. It is common to pick a very large vocabulary, so these sentence  vectors can be very sparse. This type of embedding that we have covered in this introduction  is called bag of words. We will implement this in the next section.  Another drawback is that the words is and TensorFlow have the same numerical index value of  one. We can imagine that the word is might be less important than the occurrence of the word  TensorFlow.  We will explore different types of embeddings in this chapter that attempt to address these  ideas, but first we start with an implementation of bag of words.  186   Working with bag of words We start by showing how to work with a bag of words embedding in TensorFlow. This mapping  is what we introduced in the introduction. Here we show how to use this type of embedding to  do spam prediction.  Getting ready To illustrate how to use bag of words with a text dataset, we will use a spam-ham phone text  database from the UCI machine learning data repository  https:  archive.ics.uci. edu ml datasets SMS+Spam+Collection . This is a collection of phone text messages  that are spam or not-spam  ham . We will download this data, store it for future use, and then  proceed with the bag of words method to predict whether a text is spam or not. The model  that will operate on the bag of words will be a logistic model with no hidden layers. We will use  stochastic training, with batch size of one, and compute the accuracy on a held-out test set at  the end.  How to do it… For this example, we will start by getting the data, normalizing and splitting the text, running it  through an embedding function, and training the logistic function to predict spam:  1.  The first task will be to import the necessary libraries for this task. Among the usual   libraries, we will need a .zip file library to unzip the data from the UCI machine  learning website we retrieve it from: import tensorflow as tf import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import os import numpy as np import csv import string import requests import io from zipfile import ZipFile from tensorflow.contrib import learn sess = tf.Session    2.   Instead of downloading the text data every time the script is run, we will save it and  check whether the file has been saved before. This prevents us from repeatedly  downloading the data over and over if we want to change the script parameters. After  downloading, we will extract the input and target data and change the target to be 1  for spam and 0 for ham: save_file_name = os.path.join 'temp','temp_spam_data.csv'   187   if os.path.isfile save_file_name :     text_data = []     with open save_file_name, 'r'  as temp_output_file:         reader = csv.reader temp_output_file          for row in reader:             text_data.append row  else:     zip_url = 'http:  archive.ics.uci.edu ml machine-learning- databases 00228 smsspamcollection.zip'     r = requests.get zip_url      z = ZipFile io.BytesIO r.content       file = z.read 'SMSSpamCollection'       Format Data     text_data = file.decode       text_data = text_data.encode 'ascii',errors='ignore'      text_data = text_data.decode  .split '\n'      text_data = [x.split '\t'  for x in text_data if len x >=1]           And write to csv     with open save_file_name, 'w'  as temp_output_file:         writer = csv.writer temp_output_file          writer.writerows text_data  texts = [x[1] for x in text_data] target = [x[0] for x in text_data]  Relabel 'spam' as 1, 'ham' as 0 target = [1 if x=='spam' else 0 for x in target]  3.  To reduce the potential vocabulary size, we normalize the text. To do this, we remove   the influence of capitalization and numbers in the text. Use the following code:  Convert to lower case texts = [x.lower   for x in texts]  Remove punctuation texts = [''.join c for c in x if c not in string.punctuation  for  x in texts]  Remove numbers texts = [''.join c for c in x if c not in '0123456789'  for x in  texts]  Trim extra whitespace texts = [' '.join x.split    for x in texts]  4.  We must also determine the maximum sentence size. To do this, we look at a   histogram of text lengths in the data set. We see that a good cut-off might be around  25 words. Use the following code:  Plot histogram of text lengths text_lengths = [len x.split    for x in texts]  188   text_lengths = [x for x in text_lengths if x < 50] plt.hist text_lengths, bins=25  plt.title 'Histogram of  of Words in Texts'  sentence_size = 25 min_word_freq = 3  Figure 1: A histogram of the number of words in each text in our data. We use this to establish a maximum length of   words to consider in each text. We set this as 25 words, but it can easily be set as 30 or 40 as well.  5.  TensorFlow has a built-in processing tool for determining vocabulary embedding,  called VocabularyProcessor  , under the learn.preprocessing library: vocab_processor = learn.preprocessing. VocabularyProcessor sentence_size, min_frequency=min_word_freq  vocab_processor.fit_transform texts  embedding_size = len vocab_processor.vocabulary_   6.  Now we will split the data into a train and test set:  train_indices = np.random.choice len texts ,  round len texts *0.8 , replace=False  test_indices = np.array list set range len texts    - set train_ indices    texts_train = [x for ix, x in enumerate texts  if ix in train_ indices] texts_test = [x for ix, x in enumerate texts  if ix in test_ indices] target_train = [x for ix, x in enumerate target  if ix in train_ indices] target_test = [x for ix, x in enumerate target  if ix in test_ indices]  189   7.  Next we declare the embedding matrix for the words. Sentence words will be  translated into indices. These indices will be translated into one-hot-encoded  vectors that we can create with an identity matrix, which will be the size of our word  embeddings. We will use this matrix to look up the sparse vector for each word and  add them together for the sparse sentence vector. Use the following code: identity_mat = tf.diag tf.ones shape=[embedding_size]    8.  Since we will end up doing logistic regression to predict the probability of spam,  we need to declare our logistic regression variables. Then we declare our data  placeholders as well. It is important to note that the x_data input placeholder should  be of integer type because it will be used to look up the row index of our identity  matrix and TensorFlow requires that lookup to be an integer: A = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[embedding_size,1]   b = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1,1]    Initialize placeholders x_data = tf.placeholder shape=[sentence_size], dtype=tf.int32  y_target = tf.placeholder shape=[1, 1], dtype=tf.float32   9.  Now we use TensorFlow's embedding lookup function that will map the indices of the  words in the sentence to the one-hot-encoded vectors of our identity matrix. When we  have that matrix, we create the sentence vector by summing up the aforementioned  word vectors. Use the following code: x_embed = tf.nn.embedding_lookup identity_mat, x_data  x_col_sums = tf.reduce_sum x_embed, 0   10.  Now that we have our fixed-length sentence vectors for each sentence, we want   to perform logistic regression. To do this, we will need to declare the actual model  operations. Since we are doing this one data point at a time  stochastic training , we  will expand the dimensions of our input and perform linear regression operations on  it. Remember that TensorFlow has a loss function that includes the sigmoid function,  so we do not need to include it in our output here: x_col_sums_2D = tf.expand_dims x_col_sums, 0  model_output = tf.add tf.matmul x_col_sums_2D, A , b   11.  We now declare the loss function, prediction operation, and optimization function   for training the model. Use the following code: loss = tf.reduce_mean tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_ logits model_output, y_target    Prediction operation prediction = tf.sigmoid model_output   Declare optimizer my_opt = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer 0.001  train_step = my_opt.minimize loss   190   12. Next we initialize our graph variables before we start the training generations:  init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   13.  Now we start the iteration over the sentences. TensorFlow's vocab_processor.  fit   function is a generator that operates one sentence at a time. We will use this  to our advantage to do stochastic training on our logistic model. To get a better idea  of the accuracy trend, we keep a trailing average of the past 50 training steps. If we  just plotted the current one, we would either see 1 or 0 depending on whether we  predicted that training data point correctly or not. Use the following code: loss_vec = [] train_acc_all = [] train_acc_avg = [] for ix, t in enumerate vocab_processor.fit_transform texts_ train  :     y_data = [[target_train[ix]]]          sess.run train_step, feed_dict={x_data: t, y_target: y_data}           temp_loss = sess.run loss, feed_dict={x_data: t, y_target: y_ data}      loss_vec.append temp_loss           if  ix+1 %10==0:         print 'Training Observation ' + str ix+1  + ': Loss = ' +  str temp_loss                 Keep trailing average of past 50 observations accuracy      Get prediction of single observation     [[temp_pred]] = sess.run prediction, feed_dict={x_data:t, y_ target:y_data}       Get True False if prediction is accurate     train_acc_temp = target_train[ix]==np.round temp_pred      train_acc_all.append train_acc_temp      if len train_acc_all  >= 50:         train_acc_avg.append np.mean train_acc_all[-50:]    14.  This results in the following output:  Starting Training Over 4459 Sentences. Training Observation 10: Loss = 5.45322 Training Observation 20: Loss = 3.58226 Training Observation 30: Loss = 0.0 Training Observation 4430: Loss = 1.84636 Training Observation 4440: Loss = 1.46626e-05 Training Observation 4450: Loss = 0.045941  191   15.  To get the test set accuracy, we repeat the preceding process, but only on the   prediction operation, not the training operation with the test texts:  print 'Getting Test Set Accuracy'  test_acc_all = [] for ix, t in enumerate vocab_processor.fit_transform texts_test  :     y_data = [[target_test[ix]]]          if  ix+1 %50==0:         print 'Test Observation ' + str ix+1                 Keep trailing average of past 50 observations accuracy      Get prediction of single observation     [[temp_pred]] = sess.run prediction, feed_dict={x_data:t, y_ target:y_data}       Get True False if prediction is accurate     test_acc_temp = target_test[ix]==np.round temp_pred      test_acc_all.append test_acc_temp  print '\nOverall Test Accuracy: {}'.format np.mean test_acc_all    Getting Test Set Accuracy For 1115 Sentences. Test Observation 10 Test Observation 20 Test Observation 30 Test Observation 1000 Test Observation 1050 Test Observation 1100 Overall Test Accuracy: 0.8035874439461883  How it works… For this example, we worked with the spam-ham text data from the UCI machine learning  repository. We used TensorFlow's vocabulary processing functions to create a standardized  vocabulary to work with and created sentence vectors which were the sum of each text's  word vectors. We used this sentence vector in logistic regression and obtained about an 80%  accuracy model to predict a text being spam.  There's more… It is worthwhile to mention the motivation of limiting the sentence  or text  size. In this  example, we limited the text size to 25 words. This is a common practice with bag of words  because it limits the effect of text length on the prediction. You can imagine that if we find  a word, meeting for example, that is predictive of a text being ham  not spam , then a spam  message might get through by putting in many occurrences of that word at the end.   192   In fact, this is a common problem with imbalanced target data. Imbalanced data might occur  in this situation, since spam may be hard to find and ham may be easy to find. Because of this  fact, our vocabulary that we create might be heavily skewed toward words represented in the  ham part of our data  more ham means more words are represented in ham than spam . If we  allow unlimited lengths of texts, then spammers might take advantage of this and create very  long texts, which have a higher probability of triggering non-spam word factors in our logistic  model.  In the next section, we attempt to tackle this problem in a better way by using the frequency of  word occurrence to determine the values of the word embeddings.  Implementing TF-IDF Since we can choose the embedding for each word, we might decide to change the weighting  on certain words. One such strategy is to upweight useful words and downweight overly  common or too rare words. The embedding we will explore in this recipe is an attempt to  achieve this.  Getting ready TF-IDF is an acronym that stands for Text Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency. This  term is essentially the product of text frequency and inverse document frequency for each  word.  In the prior recipe, we introduced the bag of words methodology, which assigned a value of  one for every occurrence of a word in a sentence. This is probably not ideal as each category  of sentence  spam and ham for the prior recipe example  most likely has the same frequency  of the, and, and other words, whereas words such as viagra and sale probably should have  increased importance in figuring out whether or not the text is spam.  We first want to take into consideration the word frequency. Here we consider the frequency  with which a word occurs in an individual entry. The purpose of this part  TF  is to find terms  that appear to be important in each entry:  193   But words such as the and and may appear very frequently in every entry. We want to down  weight the importance of these words, so we can imagine that multiplying the above text  frequency  TF  by the inverse of the whole document frequency might help find important  words. But since a collection of texts  a corpus  may be quite large, it is common to take the  logarithm of the inverse document frequency. This leaves us with the following formula for   TF-IDF for each word in each document entry:   is the word frequency by document, and   Here  across all documents. We can imagine that high values of TF-IDF might indicate words that  are very important to determining what a document is about.   is the total frequency of such words   Creating the TF-IDF vectors requires us to load all the text into memory and count the  occurrences of each word before we can start training our model. Because of this, it is not  implemented fully in TensorFlow, so we will use scikit-learn for creating our TF-IDF embedding,  but use TensorFlow to fit the logistic model.  How to do it…  1.  We start by loading the necessary libraries, and this time we are loading the Scikit-  learn TF-IDF preprocessing library for our texts. Use the following code: import tensorflow as tf import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import csv import numpy as np import os import string import requests import io import nltk from zipfile import ZipFile from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer  2.  We start a graph session and declare our batch size and maximum feature size for   our vocabulary: sess = tf.Session   batch_size= 200 max_featurtes = 1000  194   3.  Next we load the data, either from the Web or from our temp data folder if we have   saved it before. Use the following code: save_file_name = os.path.join 'temp','temp_spam_data.csv'  if os.path.isfile save_file_name :     text_data = []     with open save_file_name, 'r'  as temp_output_file:         reader = csv.reader temp_output_file          for row in reader:             text_data.append row  else:     zip_url = 'http:  archive.ics.uci.edu ml machine-learning- databases 00228 smsspamcollection.zip'     r = requests.get zip_url      z = ZipFile io.BytesIO r.content       file = z.read 'SMSSpamCollection'       Format Data     text_data = file.decode       text_data = text_data.encode 'ascii',errors='ignore'      text_data = text_data.decode  .split '\n'      text_data = [x.split '\t'  for x in text_data if len x >=1]           And write to csv     with open save_file_name, 'w'  as temp_output_file:         writer = csv.writer temp_output_file          writer.writerows text_data  texts = [x[1] for x in text_data] target = [x[0] for x in text_data]  Relabel 'spam' as 1, 'ham' as 0 target = [1. if x=='spam' else 0. for x in target]  4.  Just like in the prior recipe, we will decrease our vocabulary size by converting   everything to lowercase, removing punctuation, and getting rid of numbers:  Lower case texts = [x.lower   for x in texts]  Remove punctuation texts = [''.join c for c in x if c not in string.punctuation  for  x in texts]  Remove numbers texts = [''.join c for c in x if c not in '0123456789'  for x in  texts]  Trim extra whitespace texts = [' '.join x.split    for x in texts]  195   5.   In order to use scikt-learn's TF-IDF processing functions, we have to tell it how to  tokenize our sentences. By this, we just mean how to break up a sentence into the  corresponding words. A great tokenizer is already built for us in the nltk package  that does a great job of breaking up sentences into the corresponding words: def tokenizer text :     words = nltk.word_tokenize text      return words  Create TF-IDF of texts tfidf = TfidfVectorizer tokenizer=tokenizer, stop_words='english',  max_features=max_features  sparse_tfidf_texts = tfidf.fit_transform texts   6.  Next we break up our data set into a train and test set. Use the following code:  train_indices = np.random.choice sparse_tfidf_texts.shape[0],  round 0.8*sparse_tfidf_texts.shape[0] , replace=False 3test_ indices = np.array list set range sparse_tfidf_texts.shape[0]   -  set train_indices    texts_train = sparse_tfidf_texts[train_indices] texts_test = sparse_tfidf_texts[test_indices] target_train = np.array [x for ix, x in enumerate target  if ix in  train_indices]  target_test = np.array [x for ix, x in enumerate target  if ix in  test_indices]   7.  Now we can declare our model variables for logistic regression and our data   placeholders: A = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[max_features,1]   b = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1,1]    Initialize placeholders x_data = tf.placeholder shape=[None, max_features], dtype=tf. float32  y_target = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32   8.  We can now declare the model operations and the loss function. Remember that  the sigmoid part of the logistic regression is in our loss function. Use the following  code: model_output = tf.add tf.matmul x_data, A , b  loss = tf.reduce_mean tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_ logits model_output, y_target    196   9.  We add a prediction and accuracy function to the graph so that we can see the   accuracy of the train and test set as our model is training: prediction = tf.round tf.sigmoid model_output   predictions_correct = tf.cast tf.equal prediction, y_target ,  tf.float32  accuracy = tf.reduce_mean predictions_correct   10.  We declare an optimizer and initialize our graph variables next: my_opt = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer 0.0025  train_step = my_opt.minimize loss   Intitialize Variables init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   11.  We now train our model over 10,000 generations and record the test train loss and  accuracy every 100 generations and print out the status every 500 generations. Use  the following code: train_loss = [] test_loss = [] train_acc = [] test_acc = [] i_data = [] for i in range 10000 :     rand_index = np.random.choice texts_train.shape[0],  size=batch_size      rand_x = texts_train[rand_index].todense       rand_y = np.transpose [target_train[rand_index]]      sess.run train_step, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_target:  rand_y}            Only record loss and accuracy every 100 generations     if  i+1 %100==0:         i_data.append i+1          train_loss_temp = sess.run loss, feed_dict={x_data:  rand_x, y_target: rand_y}          train_loss.append train_loss_temp                   test_loss_temp = sess.run loss, feed_dict={x_data: texts_ test.todense  , y_target: np.transpose [target_test] }          test_loss.append test_loss_temp                   train_acc_temp = sess.run accuracy, feed_dict={x_data:  rand_x, y_target: rand_y}   197           train_acc.append train_acc_temp               test_acc_temp = sess.run accuracy, feed_dict={x_data:  texts_test.todense  , y_target: np.transpose [target_test] }          test_acc.append test_acc_temp      if  i+1 %500==0:         acc_and_loss = [i+1, train_loss_temp, test_loss_temp,  train_acc_temp, test_acc_temp]         acc_and_loss = [np.round x,2  for x in acc_and_loss]         print 'Generation  {}. Train Loss  Test Loss : {:.2f}   {:.2f} . Train Acc  Test Acc : {:.2f}  {:.2f} '.format *acc_and_ loss    12. This results in the following output:  Generation  500. Train Loss  Test Loss : 0.69  0.73 . Train Acc   Test Acc : 0.62  0.57  Generation  1000. Train Loss  Test Loss : 0.62  0.63 . Train Acc   Test Acc : 0.68  0.66  ... Generation  9500. Train Loss  Test Loss : 0.39  0.45 . Train Acc   Test Acc : 0.89  0.85  Generation  10000. Train Loss  Test Loss : 0.48  0.45 . Train Acc   Test Acc : 0.84  0.85   13.  And here is the code to plot the accuracy and loss for both the train and test set:  Figure 2: Cross entropy loss for our logistic spam model built off of TF-IDF values.  198   Figure 3: Train and test set accuracy for the logistic spam model built off TF-IDF values.  How it works… Using TF-IDF values for the model has increased our prediction over the prior bag of words  model from 80% accuracy to almost 90% accuracy. We achieved this by using scikit-learn's TF- IDF vocabulary processing functions and using those TF-IDF values for the logistic regression.  There's more… While we might have addressed the issue of word importance, we have not addressed the  issue of word ordering. Both bag of words and TF-IDF have no features that take into account  word ordering in a sentence. We will attempt to address this in the next few sections, which  will introduce us to Word2vec techniques.  Working with Skip-gram Embeddings In the prior recipes, we dictated our textual embeddings before training the model. With  neural networks, we can make the embedding values part of the training procedure. The first  such method we will explore is called skip-gram embedding.  Getting ready Prior to this recipe, we have not considered the order of words to be relevant in creating  word embeddings. In early 2013, Tomas Mikolov and other researchers at Google authored  a paper about creating word embeddings that addresses this issue  https:  arxiv.org  abs 1301.3781 , and they named their method Word2vec.  199   The basic idea is to create word embeddings that capture the relational aspect of words. We  seek to understand how various words are related to each other. Some examples of how these  embeddings might behave are as follows:  king – man + woman = queen  India pale ale – hops + malt = stout  We might achieve such numerical representation of words if we only consider their positional  relationship to each other. If we could analyze a large enough source of coherent documents,  we might find that the words king, man, and queen are mentioned closely to each other in  our texts. If we also know that man and woman are related in a different way, then we might  conclude that man is to king as woman is to queen, and so on.  To go about finding such an embedding, we will use a neural network that predicts  surrounding words giving an input word. We could, just as easily, switch that and try to predict  a target word given a set of surrounding words, but we will start with the prior method. Both  are variations of the Word2vec procedure. But the prior method of predicting the surrounding  words  the context  from a target word is called the skip-gram model. In the next recipe, we  will implement the other method, predicting the target word from the context, which is called  the continuous bag of words  CBOW  method:  Figure 4: An illustration of the skip-gram implementations of Word2vec. The skip-gram predicts a window of context   from the target word  window size of 1 on each side .  200   For this recipe, we will implement the skip-gram model on a set of movie review data from  Cornell University  http:  www.cs.cornell.edu people pabo movie-review- data  . The CBOW method will be implemented in the next recipe.  How to do it… For this recipe, we will create several helper functions: functions that will load the data,  normalize the text, generate the vocabulary, and generate data batches. Only after all this  will we then start training our word embeddings. To be clear, we are not predicting any target  variables, but we will be fitting the word embeddings instead:  1.  We load the necessary libraries and start a graph session:  import tensorflow as tf import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import random import os import string import requests import collections import io import tarfile import urllib.request from nltk.corpus import stopwords sess = tf.Session    2.  We declare some model parameters. We will look at 50 pairs of word embeddings at  a time  batch size . The embedding size of each word will be a vector of length 200,  and we will only consider the 10,000 most frequent words  every other word will be  classified as unknown . We will train for 50,000 generations and print out the loss  every 500. Then we declare a num_sampled variable that we will use in the loss  function  explained later , and we also declare our skip-gram window size. Here we  set our window size to two, so we will look at the surrounding two words on each side  of the target. We set our stopwords from the Python package nltk. We also want a  way to check how our word embeddings are performing, so we choose some common  movie review words and we will print out the nearest neighbor words from these every  2,000 iterations: batch_size = 50 embedding_size = 200 vocabulary_size = 10000 generations = 50000 print_loss_every = 500 num_sampled = int batch_size 2  window_size = 2  201   stops = stopwords.words 'english'  print_valid_every = 2000 valid_words = ['cliche', 'love', 'hate', 'silly', 'sad']  3.  Next we declare our data loading function, which checks to make sure we have not  downloaded the data before it downloads, or it will load the data from the disk if we  have it saved before. Use the following code: def load_movie_data  :     save_folder_name = 'temp'     pos_file = os.path.join save_folder_name, 'rt-polarity.pos'      neg_file = os.path.join save_folder_name, 'rt-polarity.neg'       Check if files are already downloaded     if os.path.exists save_folder_name :         pos_data = []         with open pos_file, 'r'  as temp_pos_file:             for row in temp_pos_file:                 pos_data.append row          neg_data = []         with open neg_file, 'r'  as temp_neg_file:             for row in temp_neg_file:                 neg_data.append row      else:  If not downloaded, download and save         movie_data_url = 'http:  www.cs.cornell.edu people pabo  movie-review-data rt-polaritydata.tar.gz'         stream_data = urllib.request.urlopen movie_data_url          tmp = io.BytesIO           while True:             s = stream_data.read 16384              if not s:                   break             tmp.write s              stream_data.close               tmp.seek 0          tar_file = tarfile.open fileobj=tmp, mode="r:gz"          pos = tar_file.extractfile 'rt-polaritydata rt-polarity. pos'          neg = tar_file.extractfile 'rt-polaritydata rt-polarity. neg'           Save pos neg reviews         pos_data = []         for line in pos:             pos_data.append line.decode 'ISO-8859-1' . encode 'ascii',errors='ignore' .decode            neg_data = []         for line in neg:  202               neg_data.append line.decode 'ISO-8859-1' . encode 'ascii',errors='ignore' .decode            tar_file.close            Write to file         if not os.path.exists save_folder_name :             os.makedirs save_folder_name           Save files         with open pos_file, "w"  as pos_file_handler:             pos_file_handler.write ''.join pos_data           with open neg_file, "w"  as neg_file_handler:             neg_file_handler.write ''.join neg_data       texts = pos_data + neg_data     target = [1]*len pos_data  + [0]*len neg_data      return texts, target  texts, target = load_movie_data    4.  Next we create a normalization function for text. This function will input a list of  strings and apply lowercasing, remove punctuation, remove numbers, trip extra  whitespace, and remove stop words. Use the following code: def normalize_text texts, stops :      Lower case     texts = [x.lower   for x in texts]      Remove punctuation     texts = [''.join c for c in x if c not in string.punctuation   for x in texts]      Remove numbers     texts = [''.join c for c in x if c not in '0123456789'  for x  in texts]      Remove stopwords     texts = [' '.join [word for word in x.split   if word not in   stops ]  for x in texts]      Trim extra whitespace     texts = [' '.join x.split    for x in texts]          return texts  texts = normalize_text texts, stops   5.  To make sure that all our movie reviews are informative, we should make sure they  are long enough to contain important word relationships. We arbitrarily set this to  three or more words: target = [target[ix] for ix, x in enumerate texts  if len x. split    > 2] texts = [x for x in texts if len x.split    > 2]  203   6.  To build our vocabulary, we create a function that creates a dictionary of words with  their count, and any word that is uncommon enough to not make our vocabulary size  cut-off, we label as 'RARE'. Use the following code: def build_dictionary sentences, vocabulary_size :      Turn sentences  list of strings  into lists of words     split_sentences = [s.split   for s in sentences]     words = [x for sublist in split_sentences for x in sublist]      Initialize list of [word, word_count] for each word,  starting with unknown     count = [['RARE', -1]]      Now add most frequent words, limited to the N-most frequent   N=vocabulary size  count.extend collections.Counter words .most_common vocabulary_ size-1        Now create the dictionary     word_dict = {}      For each word, that we want in the dictionary, add it, then  make it the value of the prior dictionary length     for word, word_count in count:         word_dict[word] = len word_dict      return word_dict   7.  We need a function that will convert a list of sentences into lists of word indices that   we can pass into our embedding lookup function. Use the following code: def text_to_numbers sentences, word_dict :      Initialize the returned data     data = []     for sentence in sentences:         sentence_data = []          For each word, either use selected index or rare word  index         for word in sentence:             if word in word_dict:                 word_ix = word_dict[word]             else:                 word_ix = 0             sentence_data.append word_ix          data.append sentence_data      return data   204   8.  Now we can actually create our dictionary and transform our list of sentences into   lists of word indices: word_dictionary = build_dictionary texts, vocabulary_size  word_dictionary_rev = dict zip word_dictionary.values  , word_ dictionary.keys     text_data = text_to_numbers texts, word_dictionary   9.  From the preceding word dictionary, we can look up the index for the validation words   we choose in step 2. Use the following code: valid_examples = [word_dictionary[x] for x in valid_words]  10.  We now create a function that will return our skip-gram batches. We want to train on   pairs of words where one word is the training input  from the target word at the center  of our window  and the other word is selected from the window. For example, the  sentence the cat in the hat may result in  input, output  pairs such as the following:   the, in ,  cat, in ,  the, in ,  hat, in , if in was the target word, and we had a window  size of two in each direction: def generate_batch_data sentences, batch_size, window_size,  method='skip_gram' :      Fill up data batch     batch_data = []     label_data = []     while len batch_data  < batch_size:          select random sentence to start         rand_sentence = np.random.choice sentences           Generate consecutive windows to look at         window_sequences = [rand_sentence[max  ix-window_ size ,0 : ix+window_size+1 ] for ix, x in enumerate rand_ sentence ]          Denote which element of each window is the center word  of interest         label_indices = [ix if ix<window_size else window_size for  ix,x in enumerate window_sequences ]                   Pull out center word of interest for each window and  create a tuple for each window         if method=='skip_gram':             batch_and_labels = [ x[y], x[:y] + x[ y+1 :]  for x,y  in zip window_sequences, label_indices ]              Make it in to a big list of tuples  target word,  surrounding word              tuple_data = [ x, y_  for x,y in batch_and_labels for  y_ in y]         else:  205               raise ValueError 'Method {} not implmented  yet.'.format method                         extract batch and labels         batch, labels = [list x  for x in zip *tuple_data ]         batch_data.extend batch[:batch_size]          label_data.extend labels[:batch_size]       Trim batch and label at the end     batch_data = batch_data[:batch_size]     label_data = label_data[:batch_size]           Convert to numpy array     batch_data = np.array batch_data      label_data = np.transpose np.array [label_data]            return batch_data, label_data   11.  We can now initialize our embedding matrix, and declare our placeholders and our   embedding lookup function. Use the following code: embeddings = tf.Variable tf.random_uniform [vocabulary_size,      embedding_size], -1.0, 1.0    Create data target placeholders x_inputs = tf.placeholder tf.int32, shape=[batch_size]  y_target = tf.placeholder tf.int32, shape=[batch_size, 1]  valid_dataset = tf.constant valid_examples, dtype=tf.int32    Lookup the word embedding: embed = tf.nn.embedding_lookup embeddings, x_inputs   12. The loss function should be something such as a softmax, which calculates the   loss on predicting the wrong word category. But since our target has 10,000 different  categories, it is very sparse. This sparsity causes problems fitting or converging for a  model. To tackle this, we use a loss function called noise-contrastive error  NCE . This  NCE loss function turns our problem into a binary prediction, by predicting the word  class versus random noise predictions. The num_sampled parameter is how much of  the batch to turn into random noise: nce_weights = tf.Variable tf.truncated_normal [vocabulary_size,      embedding_size], stddev=1.0   np.sqrt embedding_size    nce_biases = tf.Variable tf.zeros [vocabulary_size]   loss = tf.reduce_mean tf.nn.nce_loss nce_weights, nce_biases,  embed,      y_target, num_sampled, vocabulary_size    206   13.  Now we need to create a way to find nearby words to our validation words. We will do  this by computing the cosine similarity between the validation set and all of our word  embeddings, then we can print out the closest set of words for each validation word.  Use the following code: norm = tf.sqrt tf.reduce_sum tf.square embeddings , 1, keep_ dims=True   normalized_embeddings = embeddings   norm valid_embeddings = tf.nn.embedding_lookup normalized_embeddings,  valid_dataset  similarity = tf.matmul valid_embeddings, normalized_embeddings,  transpose_b=True   14.  We now declare our optimizer function, and initialize our model variables:  optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer learning_rate=1.0 . minimize loss  init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   15.  Now we can train our embeddings and print off the loss and the closest words to our   validation set during training. Use the following code: loss_vec = [] loss_x_vec = [] for i in range generations :     batch_inputs, batch_labels = generate_batch_data text_data,  batch_size, window_size      feed_dict = {x_inputs : batch_inputs, y_target : batch_labels}      Run the train step     sess.run optimizer, feed_dict=feed_dict       Return the loss     if  i+1  % print_loss_every == 0:         loss_val = sess.run loss, feed_dict=feed_dict          loss_vec.append loss_val          loss_x_vec.append i+1          print "Loss at step {} : {}".format i+1, loss_val               Validation: Print some random words and top 5 related words     if  i+1  % print_valid_every == 0:         sim = sess.run similarity, feed_dict=feed_dict          for j in range len valid_words  :             valid_word = word_dictionary_rev[valid_examples[j]]             top_k = 5  number of nearest neighbors             nearest =  -sim[j, :] .argsort  [1:top_k+1]             log_str = "Nearest to {}:".format valid_word              for k in range top_k :                 close_word = word_dictionary_rev[nearest[k]]  207                   log_str = "%s %s," %  log_str, close_word              print log_str   16.  This results in the following output:  Loss at step 500 : 13.387781143188477 Loss at step 1000 : 7.240757465362549 Loss at step 49500 : 0.9395825862884521 Loss at step 50000 : 0.30323168635368347 Nearest to cliche: walk, intrigue, brim, eileen, dumber, Nearest to love: plight, fiction, complete, lady, bartleby, Nearest to hate: style, throws, players, fearlessness, astringent, Nearest to silly: delivers, meow, regain, nicely, anger, Nearest to sad: dizzying, variety, existing, environment, tunney,  How it works… We have trained a Word2vec model, via the skip-gram method, on a corpus of movie review  data. We downloaded the data, converted the words to an index with a dictionary, and used  those index numbers as an embedding lookup, which we trained so that nearby words could  be predictive of each other.  There's more… At first glance, we might expect the set of nearby words to the validation set to be synonyms.  This is not quite the case because very rarely do synonyms actually appear next to each other  in sentences. What we are really getting at is predicting which words are in proximity to each  other in our data set. We hope that using an embedding like this would make prediction easier.  In order to use these embeddings, we must make them reusable and save them. We do this in  the next recipe by implementing the CBOW embeddings.  Working with CBOW Embeddings In this recipe we will implement the CBOW method of word2vec. It is very similar to the skip- gram method, except we are predicting a single target word from a surrounding window of  context words.  Getting ready In this recipe, we will implement the CBOW method of Word2vec. It is very similar to the skip- gram method, except we are predicting a single target word from a surrounding window of  context words.  208   In the prior example, we treated each combination of window and target as a group of paired  inputs and outputs, but with CBOW we will add the surrounding window embeddings together  to get one embedding to predict the target word embedding:  Figure 5: A depiction of how the CBOW embedding data is created out of a window on an example sentence  window   size = 1 on each side .  Most of the code will stay the same, except we will need to change how we create the  embeddings and how we generate the data from the sentences.  To make the code easier to read, we have moved all the major functions to a separate file,  called text_helpers.py, in the same directory. This function holds the data loading, text  normalization, dictionary creation, and batch generation functions. These functions are  exactly as they appear in the Working with Skip-gram Embeddings recipe, except where noted.  209   How to do it…  1.  We start by loading the necessary libraries, including the aforementioned text_  helpers.py script, where we put our functions for text loading and manipulation.  We then start a graph session: import tensorflow as tf import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import random import os import pickle import string import requests import collections import io import tarfile import urllib.request import text_helpers from nltk.corpus import stopwords sess = tf.Session    2.  We want to make sure that our temporary data and parameter saving folder exists   before we start saving to it. Use the following code:  Make a saving directory if it doesn't exist data_folder_name = 'temp' if not os.path.exists data_folder_name :     os.makedirs data_folder_name   3.  We declare the parameters of our model, which will be similar to the skip-gram   method in the prior recipe:  Declare model parameters batch_size = 500 embedding_size = 200 vocabulary_size = 2000 generations = 50000 model_learning_rate = 0.001 num_sampled = int batch_size 2 window_size = 3  Add checkpoints to training save_embeddings_every = 5000 print_valid_every = 5000 print_loss_every = 100  210    Declare stop words stops = stopwords.words 'english'   We pick some test words. We are expecting synonyms to appear valid_words = ['love', 'hate', 'happy', 'sad', 'man', 'woman']  4.  We have moved over the data loading and text normalization functions to a separate  file that we imported at the start, so we can call them now. We also want only reviews  that have three or more words in them. Use the following code: texts, target = text_helpers.load_movie_data data_folder_name  texts = text_helpers.normalize_text texts, stops   Texts must contain at least 3 words target = [target[ix] for ix, x in enumerate texts  if len x. split    > 2] texts = [x for x in texts if len x.split    > 2]  5.  Now we create our vocabulary dictionary that will help us to look up words. We also   need a reverse dictionary that looks up words from indices when we want to print out  the nearest words to our validation set: word_dictionary = text_helpers.build_dictionary texts,  vocabulary_size  word_dictionary_rev = dict zip word_dictionary.values  , word_ dictionary.keys     text_data = text_helpers.text_to_numbers texts, word_dictionary   Get validation word keys valid_examples = [word_dictionary[x] for x in valid_words]  6.  Next we initialize the word embeddings that we want to fit and declare the model data   placeholders. Use the following code: embeddings = tf.Variable tf.random_uniform [vocabulary_size,  embedding_size], -1.0, 1.0    Create data target placeholders x_inputs = tf.placeholder tf.int32, shape=[batch_size,  2*window_size]  y_target = tf.placeholder tf.int32, shape=[batch_size, 1]  valid_dataset = tf.constant valid_examples, dtype=tf.int32   7.  We can now create how we want to deal with the word embeddings. Since the CBOW  model adds up the embeddings of the context window, we create a loop and add up  all of the embeddings in the window:  Lookup the word embeddings and  Add together window embeddings: embed = tf.zeros [batch_size, embedding_size]  for element in range 2*window_size :     embed += tf.nn.embedding_lookup embeddings, x_inputs[:,  element]   211   8.  We use the NCE loss function that TensorFlow has built in because our categorical   output is too sparse for the softmax to converge, as follows:  NCE loss parameters nce_weights = tf.Variable tf.truncated_normal [vocabulary_size,  embedding_size], stddev=1.0   np.sqrt embedding_size    nce_biases = tf.Variable tf.zeros [vocabulary_size]    Declare loss function  NCE  loss = tf.reduce_mean tf.nn.nce_loss nce_weights, nce_biases,  embed,  y_target, num_sampled, vocabulary_size    9.  Just like in the skip-gram recipe, we will use cosine similarity to print off the nearest   words to our validation word data set to get an idea of how our embeddings are  working. Use the following code: norm = tf.sqrt tf.reduce_sum tf.square embeddings , 1, keep_ dims=True   normalized_embeddings = embeddings   norm valid_embeddings = tf.nn.embedding_lookup normalized_embeddings,  valid_dataset  similarity = tf.matmul valid_embeddings, normalized_embeddings,  transpose_b=True   10.  To save our embeddings, we must load the TensorFlow train.Saver method. This   method defaults to saving the whole graph, but we can give it an argument just to  save the embedding variable, and we can also give it a specific name. Here we give it  the same name as the variable name in our graph: saver = tf.train.Saver {"embeddings": embeddings}   11.  We now declare an optimizer function and initialize our model variables. Use the   following code: optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer learning_rate=model_ learning_rate .minimize loss  init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   12. Finally, we can loop across our training step and print out the loss, and save the   embeddings and dictionary when we specify: loss_vec = [] loss_x_vec = [] for i in range generations :     batch_inputs, batch_labels = text_helpers.generate_batch_ data text_data, batch_size, window_size, method='cbow'      feed_dict = {x_inputs : batch_inputs, y_target : batch_labels}      Run the train step     sess.run optimizer, feed_dict=feed_dict   212        Return the loss     if  i+1  % print_loss_every == 0:         loss_val = sess.run loss, feed_dict=feed_dict          loss_vec.append loss_val          loss_x_vec.append i+1          print 'Loss at step {} : {}'.format i+1, loss_val               Validation: Print some random words and top 5 related words     if  i+1  % print_valid_every == 0:         sim = sess.run similarity, feed_dict=feed_dict          for j in range len valid_words  :             valid_word = word_dictionary_rev[valid_examples[j]]             top_k = 5  number of nearest neighbors             nearest =  -sim[j, :] .argsort  [1:top_k+1]             log_str = "Nearest to {}:".format valid_word              for k in range top_k :                 close_word = word_dictionary_rev[nearest[k]]                 print_str = '{} {},'.format log_str, close_word              print print_str                    Save dictionary + embeddings     if  i+1  % save_embeddings_every == 0:          Save vocabulary dictionary         with open os.path.join data_folder_name,'movie_vocab. pkl' , 'wb'  as f:             pickle.dump word_dictionary, f                    Save embeddings         model_checkpoint_path = os.path.join os.getcwd  ,data_ folder_name,'cbow_movie_embeddings.ckpt'          save_path = saver.save sess, model_checkpoint_path          print 'Model saved in file: {}'.format save_path    13.  This results in the following output:  Loss at step 100 : 62.04829025268555 Loss at step 200 : 33.182334899902344 Loss at step 49900 : 1.6794960498809814 Loss at step 50000 : 1.5071022510528564 Nearest to love: clarity, cult, cliched, literary, memory, Nearest to hate: bringing, gifted, almost, next, wish, Nearest to happy: ensemble, fall, courage, uneven, girls, Nearest to sad: santa, devoid, biopic, genuinely, becomes, Nearest to man: project, stands, none, soul, away, Nearest to woman: crush, even, x, team, ensemble, Model saved in file: ... temp cbow_movie_embeddings.ckpt  213   14.  All but one of the functions in the text_helpers.py file have functions that come   directly from the prior recipe. We make a slight addition to the generate_batch_ data   function by adding a 'cbow' method as follows: elif method=='cbow':     batch_and_labels = [ x[:y] + x[ y+1 :], x[y]  for x,y in  zip window_sequences, label_indices ]      Only keep windows with consistent 2*window_size     batch_and_labels = [ x,y  for x,y in batch_and_labels if  len x ==2*window_size]     batch, labels = [list x  for x in zip *batch_and_labels ]  How it works… This recipe, Word2vec embeddings via CBOW, works very similarly to creating the embeddings  like we did with skip-gram. The main difference is how we generate the data and combine the  embeddings.  For this recipe, we loaded the data, normalized the text, created a vocabulary dictionary,  used the dictionary to look up embeddings, combined the embeddings, and trained a neural  network to predict the target word.  There's more… It is worthwhile to note that the CBOW method trains on a summed-up embedding of the  surrounding window to predict the target word. One effect of this is that the CBOW method of  word2vec has a smoothing effect that the skip-gram method does not and it is reasonable to  think that this might be preferred for smaller textual data sets.  Making Predictions with Word2vec In this recipe, we use the previously learned embedding strategies to perform classification.  Getting ready Now that we have created and saved CBOW word embeddings, we need to use them to make  sentiment predictions on the movie data set. In this recipe, we will learn how to load and  use prior-trained embeddings and use these embeddings to perform sentiment analysis by  training a logistic linear model to predict a good or bad review.  214   Sentiment analysis is a really hard task to do because human language makes it very hard  to grasp the subtleties and nuances of the true meaning. Sarcasm, jokes, and ambiguous  references all make the task exponentially harder. We will create a simple logistic regression  on the movie review data set to see whether we can get any information out of the CBOW  embeddings we created and saved in the prior recipe. Since the focus of this recipe is in the  loading and usage of saved embeddings, we will not pursue more complicated models.  How to do it…  1.  We begin by loading the necessary libraries and starting a graph session:  import tensorflow as tf import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import random import os import pickle import string import requests import collections import io import tarfile import urllib.request import text_helpers from nltk.corpus import stopwords sess = tf.Session    2.  Now we declare the model parameters. We should note that the embedding size   should be the same as the embedding size we used to create the prior CBOW  embeddings. Use the following code: embedding_size = 200 vocabulary_size = 2000 batch_size = 100 max_words = 100 stops = stopwords.words 'english'   3.  We load and transform the text data from our text_helpers.py file we have   created. Use the following code: data_folder_name = 'temp' texts, target = text_helpers.load_movie_data data_folder_name   Normalize text print 'Normalizing Text Data'  texts = text_helpers.normalize_text texts, stops   Texts must contain at least 3 words  215   target = [target[ix] for ix, x in enumerate texts  if len x. split    > 2] texts = [x for x in texts if len x.split    > 2]  train_indices = np.random.choice len target ,  round 0.8*len target  , replace=False  test_indices = np.array list set range len target    - set train_ indices    texts_train = [x for ix, x in enumerate texts  if ix in train_ indices] texts_test = [x for ix, x in enumerate texts  if ix in test_ indices] target_train = np.array [x for ix, x in enumerate target  if ix in  train_indices]  target_test = np.array [x for ix, x in enumerate target  if ix in  test_indices]   4.  We now load our word dictionary we created while fitting the CBOW embeddings.  This is important to load so that we have the same exact mapping from word to  embedding index, as follows: dict_file = os.path.join data_folder_name, 'movie_vocab.pkl'  word_dictionary = pickle.load open dict_file, 'rb'    5.  We can now convert our loaded sentence data to a numerical numpy array with our   word dictionary: text_data_train = np.array text_helpers.text_to_numbers texts_ train, word_dictionary   text_data_test = np.array text_helpers.text_to_numbers texts_test,  word_dictionary    6.  Since movie reviews are of different lengths, we standardize them to be all the same   length, and in our case we set it to 100 words. If a review has less than 100 words,  we will pad it with zeros. Use the following code: text_data_train = np.array [x[0:max_words] for x in [y+[0]*max_ words for y in text_data_train]]  text_data_test = np.array [x[0:max_words] for x in [y+[0]*max_ words for y in text_data_test]]   7.  Now we declare our model variables and placeholders for the logistic regression. Use   the following code: A = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[embedding_size,1]   b = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1,1]    Initialize placeholders x_data = tf.placeholder shape=[None, max_words], dtype=tf.int32  y_target = tf.placeholder shape=[None, 1], dtype=tf.float32   216   8.   In order for TensorFlow to restore our prior-trained embeddings, we must first give the  saver method a variable to restore into, so we create a embedding variable that is of  the same shape as the embeddings we will load: embeddings = tf.Variable tf.random_uniform [vocabulary_size,  embedding_size], -1.0, 1.0    9.  Now we put our embedding lookup function on the graph and take the average   embeddings of all the words in the sentence. Use the following code: embed = tf.nn.embedding_lookup embeddings, x_data   Take average of all word embeddings in documents embed_avg = tf.reduce_mean embed, 1   10.  Next, we declare our model operations and our loss function, remembering that our   loss function has the sigmoid operation built in already, as follows: model_output = tf.add tf.matmul embed_avg, A , b   Declare loss function  Cross Entropy loss  loss = tf.reduce_mean tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_ logits model_output, y_target    11.  Now we add prediction and accuracy functions to the graph so that we can   evaluate the accuracy as the model is training. Use the following code: prediction = tf.round tf.sigmoid model_output   predictions_correct = tf.cast tf.equal prediction, y_target ,  tf.float32  accuracy = tf.reduce_mean predictions_correct   12. We declare an optimizer function and initialize the following model variables:  my_opt = tf.train.AdagradOptimizer 0.005  train_step = my_opt.minimize loss  init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   13.  Now that we have a random initialized embedding, we can tell the Saver method  to load our prior CBOW embeddings into our embedding variable. Use the following  code: model_checkpoint_path = os.path.join data_folder_name,'cbow_movie_ embeddings.ckpt'  saver = tf.train.Saver {"embeddings": embeddings}  saver.restore sess, model_checkpoint_path   14.  Now we can start the training generations. Note that every 100 generations, we save  the training and test loss and accuracy. We will only print out the model status every  500 generations. Use the following code: train_loss = [] test_loss = []  217   train_acc = [] test_acc = [] i_data = [] for i in range 10000 :     rand_index = np.random.choice text_data_train.shape[0],  size=batch_size      rand_x = text_data_train[rand_index]     rand_y = np.transpose [target_train[rand_index]]      sess.run train_step, feed_dict={x_data: rand_x, y_target:  rand_y}            Only record loss and accuracy every 100 generations     if  i+1 %100==0:         i_data.append i+1          train_loss_temp = sess.run loss, feed_dict={x_data:  rand_x, y_target: rand_y}          train_loss.append train_loss_temp                   test_loss_temp = sess.run loss, feed_dict={x_data: text_ data_test, y_target: np.transpose [target_test] }          test_loss.append test_loss_temp                   train_acc_temp = sess.run accuracy, feed_dict={x_data:  rand_x, y_target: rand_y}          train_acc.append train_acc_temp          test_acc_temp = sess.run accuracy, feed_dict={x_data:  text_data_test, y_target: np.transpose [target_test] }          test_acc.append test_acc_temp      if  i+1 %500==0:         acc_and_loss = [i+1, train_loss_temp, test_loss_temp,  train_acc_temp, test_acc_temp]         acc_and_loss = [np.round x,2  for x in acc_and_loss]         print 'Generation  {}. Train Loss  Test Loss : {:.2f}   {:.2f} . Train Acc  Test Acc : {:.2f}  {:.2f} '.format *acc_and_ loss    15.  This results in the following output:  Generation  500. Train Loss  Test Loss : 0.70  0.71 . Train Acc   Test Acc : 0.52  0.48  Generation  1000. Train Loss  Test Loss : 0.69  0.72 . Train Acc   Test Acc : 0.56  0.47  ... Generation  9500. Train Loss  Test Loss : 0.69  0.70 . Train Acc   Test Acc : 0.57  0.55  Generation  10000. Train Loss  Test Loss : 0.70  0.70 . Train Acc   Test Acc : 0.59  0.55   218   16.  Here is the code to plot the training and test loss and accuracy that we saved every   100 generations. Use the following code:  Plot loss over time plt.plot i_data, train_loss, 'k-', label='Train Loss'  plt.plot i_data, test_loss, 'r--', label='Test Loss', linewidth=4  plt.title 'Cross Entropy Loss per Generation'  plt.xlabel 'Generation'  plt.ylabel 'Cross Entropy Loss'  plt.legend loc='upper right'  plt.show    Plot train and test accuracy plt.plot i_data, train_acc, 'k-', label='Train Set Accuracy'  plt.plot i_data, test_acc, 'r--', label='Test Set Accuracy',  linewidth=4  plt.title 'Train and Test Accuracy'  plt.xlabel 'Generation'  plt.ylabel 'Accuracy'  plt.legend loc='lower right'  plt.show    Figure 6: Here we observe the train and test loss over 10,000 generations.  219   Figure 7: We can observe that the train and test set accuracy is slowly improving over 10,000 generations. It is   worthwhile to note that this model performs very poorly and is only slightly better than a random predictor.  How it works… We loaded our prior CBOW embeddings, and performed logistic regression on the average  embedding of a review.  The important methods to note here are how we load model  variables from the disk onto already initialized variables in our current model. We also have  to remember to store and load our vocabulary dictionary that was created prior to training the  embeddings. It is very important to have the same mapping from words to embedding indices  when using the same embedding.  There's more… We can see we almost achieve a 60% accuracy on predicting the sentiment. For example, it  is a hard task to know the meaning behind the word great; it could be used in a negative or  positive context within the review.  To tackle this problem, we want to somehow create embeddings for the documents  themselves that can address the sentiment issue. Usually, a whole review is positive or  a whole review is negative. We can use this to our advantage in the Using Doc2vec for  sentiment analysis recipe.  220   Using Doc2vec for Sentiment Analysis Now that we know how to train word embeddings, we can also extend those methodologies to  have a document embedding. We explore how to do this in this recipe with TensorFlow.  Getting ready In the prior sections about Word2vec methods, we have managed to capture positional  relationships between words. What we have not done is capture the relationship of words  to the document  or movie review  that they come from. One extension of Word2vec that  captures a document effect is called Doc2vec.  The basic idea of Doc2vec is to introduce document embedding, along with the word  embeddings that may help to capture the tone of the document. For example, just knowing  that the words movie and love are nearby to each other may not help us determine the  sentiment of the review. The review may be talking about how they love the movie or how they  do not love the movie. But if the review is long enough and more negative words are found  in the document, maybe we can pick up on an overall tone that may help us predict the next  words.  Doc2vec simply adds an additional embedding matrix for the documents and uses a window  of words plus the document index to predict the next word. All word windows in a document  have the same document index. It is worthwhile to mention that it is important to think about  how we will combine the document embedding and the word embeddings. We combine  the word embeddings in the word window by taking the sum and there are two main ways  to combine these embeddings with the document embedding. Commonly, the document  embedding is either added to the word embeddings, or concatenated to the end of the word  embeddings. If we add the two embeddings, we limit the document embedding size to be the  same size as the word embedding size. If we concatenate, we lift that restriction, but increase  the number of variables that the logistic regression must deal with. For illustrative purposes,  we show how to deal with concatenation in this recipe. But in general, for smaller datasets,  addition is the better choice.  The first step will be to fit both the document and word embeddings on the whole corpus of  movie reviews, then we perform a train-test split, train a logistic model, and see whether we  can improve upon the accuracy of predicting the review sentiment.  221   How to do it…  1.  We start by loading the necessary libraries and starting a graph session, as follows:  import tensorflow as tf import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import random import os import pickle import string import requests import collections import io import tarfile import urllib.request import text_helpers from nltk.corpus import stopwords sess = tf.Session    2.  We load the movie review corpus, just as we have done in the prior two recipes. Use   the following code: data_folder_name = 'temp' if not os.path.exists data_folder_name :     os.makedirs data_folder_name  texts, target = text_helpers.load_movie_data data_folder_name   3.  We declare the model parameters. See the following:  batch_size = 500 vocabulary_size = 7500 generations = 100000 model_learning_rate = 0.001 embedding_size = 200    Word embedding size doc_embedding_size = 100    Document embedding size concatenated_size = embedding_size + doc_embedding_size num_sampled = int batch_size 2  window_size = 3        How many words to consider to the left.  Add checkpoints to training save_embeddings_every = 5000 print_valid_every = 5000 print_loss_every = 100  Declare stop words stops = stopwords.words 'english'   We pick a few test words. valid_words = ['love', 'hate', 'happy', 'sad', 'man', 'woman']  222   4.  We normalize the movie reviews and make sure that each movie review is larger than   the desired window size. Use the following code: texts = text_helpers.normalize_text texts, stops   Texts must contain at least as much as the prior window size target = [target[ix] for ix, x in enumerate texts  if len x. split     > window_size] texts = [x for x in texts if len x.split    > window_size]     assert len target ==len texts    5.  Now we create our word dictionary. It is important to note that we do not have to  create a document dictionary. The document indices will be just the index of the  document; each document will have a unique index. See the following code: word_dictionary = text_helpers.build_dictionary texts, vocabulary_ size  word_dictionary_rev = dict zip word_dictionary.values  , word_ dictionary.keys     text_data = text_helpers.text_to_numbers texts, word_dictionary   Get validation word keys valid_examples = [word_dictionary[x] for x in valid_words]  6.  Next we define our word embeddings and document embeddings. Then we declare   our noise-contrastive loss parameters. Use the following code: embeddings = tf.Variable tf.random_uniform [vocabulary_size,  embedding_size], -1.0, 1.0   doc_embeddings = tf.Variable tf.random_uniform [len texts , doc_ embedding_size], -1.0, 1.0    NCE loss parameters nce_weights = tf.Variable tf.truncated_normal [vocabulary_size,  concatenated_size],                                                stddev=1.0    np.sqrt concatenated_size    nce_biases = tf.Variable tf.zeros [vocabulary_size]    7.  We now declare our placeholders for the Doc2vec indices and target word index. Note   that the size of the input indices is the window size plus one. This is because every  data window we generate will have an additional document index with it, as follows: x_inputs = tf.placeholder tf.int32, shape=[None, window_size + 1]  y_target = tf.placeholder tf.int32, shape=[None, 1]  valid_dataset = tf.constant valid_examples, dtype=tf.int32   223   8.  Now we have to create our embedding function that adds together the word   embeddings and then concatenates the document embedding at the end. Use the  following code: embed = tf.zeros [batch_size, embedding_size]  for element in range window_size :     embed += tf.nn.embedding_lookup embeddings, x_inputs[:,  element]  doc_indices = tf.slice x_inputs, [0,window_size],[batch_size,1]  doc_embed = tf.nn.embedding_lookup doc_embeddings,doc_indices   concatenate embeddings final_embed = tf.concat 1, [embed, tf.squeeze doc_embed ]   9.  We also need to declare the cosine distance from a set of validation words that we  can print out every so often to observe the progress of our Doc2vec model. See the  following code: loss = tf.reduce_mean tf.nn.nce_loss nce_weights, nce_biases,  final_embed, y_target, num_sampled, vocabulary_size                                          Create optimizer optimizer =   tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer learning_rate=model_learning_ rate  train_step = optimizer.minimize loss   10.  We also need to declare the cosine distance from a set of validation words that we  can print out every so often to observe the progress of our Doc2vec model. Use the  following code: norm = tf.sqrt tf.reduce_sum tf.square embeddings , 1,  keep_dims=True   normalized_embeddings = embeddings   norm valid_embeddings = tf.nn.embedding_lookup normalized_embeddings,  valid_dataset  similarity = tf.matmul valid_embeddings, normalized_embeddings,  transpose_b=True   11.  To save our embeddings for later, we create a model saver function. Then we can   initialize the variables, the last step before we commence training on the word  embeddings: saver = tf.train.Saver {"embeddings": embeddings, "doc_ embeddings":  doc_embeddings}  init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   Test  224   loss_vec = [] loss_x_vec = [] for i in range generations :     batch_inputs, batch_labels = text_helpers.generate_batch_ data text_data, batch_size,                                                                    window_size, method='doc2vec'      feed_dict = {x_inputs : batch_inputs, y_target : batch_labels}       Run the train step     sess.run train_step, feed_dict=feed_dict        Return the loss     if  i+1  % print_loss_every == 0:         loss_val = sess.run loss, feed_dict=feed_dict          loss_vec.append loss_val          loss_x_vec.append i+1          print 'Loss at step {} : {}'.format i+1, loss_val               Validation: Print some random words and top 5 related words     if  i+1  % print_valid_every == 0:         sim = sess.run similarity, feed_dict=feed_dict          for j in range len valid_words  :             valid_word = word_dictionary_rev[valid_examples[j]]             top_k = 5  number of nearest neighbors             nearest =  -sim[j, :] .argsort  [1:top_k+1]             log_str = "Nearest to {}:".format valid_word              for k in range top_k :                 close_word = word_dictionary_rev[nearest[k]]                 log_str = '{} {},'.format log_str, close_word              print log_str                    Save dictionary + embeddings     if  i+1  % save_embeddings_every == 0:          Save vocabulary dictionary         with open os.path.join data_folder_name,'movie_vocab. pkl' , 'wb'  as f:             pickle.dump word_dictionary, f                    Save embeddings         model_checkpoint_path = os.path.join os.getcwd  ,data_ folder_name,'doc2vec_movie_embeddings.ckpt'          save_path = saver.save sess, model_checkpoint_path         print 'Model saved in file: {}'.format save_path    225   12. This results in the following output:  Loss at step 100 : 126.176816940307617 Loss at step 200 : 89.608322143554688 Loss at step 99900 : 17.733346939086914 Loss at step 100000 : 17.384489059448242 Nearest to love: ride, with, by, its, start, Nearest to hate: redundant, snapshot, from, performances,  extravagant, Nearest to happy: queen, chaos, them, succumb, elegance, Nearest to sad: terms, pity, chord, wallet, morality, Nearest to man: of, teen, an, our, physical, Nearest to woman: innocuous, scenes, prove, except, lady, Model saved in file:  ... temp doc2vec_movie_embeddings.ckpt  13.  Now that we have trained the Doc2vec embeddings, we can use these embeddings   in a logistic regression to predict the review sentiment. First we set some parameters  for the logistic regression. Use the following code: max_words = 20  maximum review word length logistic_batch_size = 500  training batch size  14.  We now split the data set into a train and test set:  train_indices = np.sort np.random.choice len target ,  round 0.8*len target  , replace=False   test_indices = np.sort np.array list set range len target    –  set train_indices     texts_train = [x for ix, x in enumerate texts  if ix in train_ indices] texts_test = [x for ix, x in enumerate texts  if ix in test_ indices] target_train = np.array [x for ix, x in enumerate target  if ix in  train_indices]  target_test = np.array [x for ix, x in enumerate target  if ix in  test_indices]   15.  Next we convert the reviews to numerical word indices and pad or crop each review to   be 20 words, as follows: text_data_train = np.array text_helpers.text_to_numbers texts_ train,  word_dictionary   text_data_test = np.array text_helpers.text_to_numbers texts_test,  word_dictionary    Pad crop movie reviews to specific length text_data_train = np.array [x[0:max_words] for x in [y+[0]*max_ words  for y in text_data_train]]   226   text_data_test = np.array [x[0:max_words] for x in [y+[0]*max_ words  for y in text_data_test]]   16.  Now we declare the parts of the graph that pertain to the logistic regression model.   We add the data placeholders, the variables, model operations, and the loss  function as follows:  Define Logistic placeholders log_x_inputs = tf.placeholder tf.int32, shape=[None, max_words +  1]  log_y_target = tf.placeholder tf.int32, shape=[None, 1]  A = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[concatenated_size,1]   b = tf.Variable tf.random_normal shape=[1,1]     Declare logistic model  sigmoid in loss function  model_output = tf.add tf.matmul log_final_embed, A , b    Declare loss function  Cross Entropy loss  logistic_loss = tf.reduce_mean tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_ logits model_output,  tf.cast log_y_target, tf.float32     17.  We need to create another embedding function. The embedding function in the   first half is trained on a smaller window of three words  and a document index  to  predict the next word. Here we will do the same but with the 20-word review. Use the  following code:  Add together element embeddings in window: log_embed = tf.zeros [logistic_batch_size, embedding_size]  for element in range max_words :     log_embed += tf.nn.embedding_lookup embeddings, log_x_ inputs[:, element]  log_doc_indices = tf.slice log_x_inputs, [0,max_words],[logistic_ batch_size,1]  log_doc_embed = tf.nn.embedding_lookup doc_embeddings,log_doc_ indices   concatenate embeddings log_final_embed = tf.concat 1, [log_embed, tf.squeeze log_doc_ embed ]   18.  Next we create a prediction function and accuracy method on the graph so   that we can evaluate the performance of the model as we run through the training  generations. Then we declare an optimizing function and initialize all the variables: prediction = tf.round tf.sigmoid model_output   predictions_correct = tf.cast tf.equal prediction, tf.cast log_y_ target, tf.float32  , tf.float32   227   accuracy = tf.reduce_mean predictions_correct   Declare optimizer logistic_opt = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer learning_ rate=0.01  logistic_train_step = logistic_opt.minimize logistic_loss, var_ list=[A, b]   Intitialize Variables init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   19.  Now we can start the logistic model training:  train_loss = [] test_loss = [] train_acc = [] test_acc = [] i_data = [] for i in range 10000 :     rand_index = np.random.choice text_data_train.shape[0],  size=logistic_batch_size      rand_x = text_data_train[rand_index]      Append review index at the end of text data     rand_x_doc_indices = train_indices[rand_index]     rand_x = np.hstack  rand_x, np.transpose [rand_x_doc_ indices]        rand_y = np.transpose [target_train[rand_index]]           feed_dict = {log_x_inputs : rand_x, log_y_target : rand_y}     sess.run logistic_train_step, feed_dict=feed_dict            Only record loss and accuracy every 100 generations     if  i+1 %100==0:         rand_index_test = np.random.choice text_data_test. shape[0], size=logistic_batch_size          rand_x_test = text_data_test[rand_index_test]          Append review index at the end of text data         rand_x_doc_indices_test = test_indices[rand_index_test]         rand_x_test = np.hstack  rand_x_test,  np.transpose [rand_x_doc_indices_test]            rand_y_test = np.transpose [target_test[rand_index_test]]                   test_feed_dict = {log_x_inputs: rand_x_test, log_y_target:  rand_y_test}                  i_data.append i+1          train_loss_temp = sess.run logistic_loss, feed_dict=feed_ dict          train_loss.append train_loss_temp   228                    test_loss_temp = sess.run logistic_loss, feed_dict=test_ feed_dict          test_loss.append test_loss_temp                   train_acc_temp = sess.run accuracy, feed_dict=feed_dict          train_acc.append train_acc_temp               test_acc_temp = sess.run accuracy, feed_dict=test_feed_ dict          test_acc.append test_acc_temp      if  i+1 %500==0:         acc_and_loss = [i+1, train_loss_temp, test_loss_temp,  train_acc_temp, test_acc_temp]         acc_and_loss = [np.round x,2  for x in acc_and_loss]         print 'Generation  {}. Train Loss  Test Loss : {:.2f}   {:.2f} . Train Acc  Test Acc : {:.2f}  {:.2f} '.format *acc_and_ loss    20. This results in the following output:  Generation  500. Train Loss  Test Loss : 5.62  7.45 . Train Acc   Test Acc : 0.52  0.48  Generation  10000. Train Loss  Test Loss : 2.35  2.51 . Train Acc   Test Acc : 0.59  0.58   21.  We should also note that we have created a separate data batch generating method  in the text_helpers.generate_batch_data   function called Doc2vec, which  we used in the first part of this recipe to train the Doc2vec embeddings. Here is the  excerpt from that function that pertains to this method: def generate_batch_data sentences, batch_size, window_size,  method='skip_gram' :      Fill up data batch     batch_data = []     label_data = []     while len batch_data  < batch_size:          select random sentence to start         rand_sentence_ix = int np.random.choice len sentences ,  size=1           rand_sentence = sentences[rand_sentence_ix]          Generate consecutive windows to look at         window_sequences = [rand_sentence[max  ix-window_ size ,0 : ix+window_size+1 ] for ix, x in enumerate rand_ sentence ]          Denote which element of each window is the center word  f interest         label_indices = [ix if ix<window_size else window_size for  ix,x in enumerate window_sequences ]           229            Pull out center word of interest for each window and  create a tuple for each window         if method=='skip_gram':             ...         elif method=='cbow':             ...         elif method=='doc2vec':              For doc2vec we keep LHS window only to predict  target word             batch_and_labels = [ rand_sentence[i:i+window_size],  rand_sentence[i+window_size]  for i in range 0, len rand_ sentence -window_size ]             batch, labels = [list x  for x in zip *batch_and_ labels ]              Add document index to batch!! Remember that we must  extract the last index in batch for the doc-index             batch = [x + [rand_sentence_ix] for x in batch]         else:             raise ValueError 'Method {} not implmented  yet.'.format method                         extract batch and labels         batch_data.extend batch[:batch_size]          label_data.extend labels[:batch_size]       Trim batch and label at the end     batch_data = batch_data[:batch_size]     label_data = label_data[:batch_size]           Convert to numpy array     batch_data = np.array batch_data      label_data = np.transpose np.array [label_data]            return batch_data, label_data   How it works… In this recipe, we performed two training loops. The first was to fit the Doc2vec embeddings,  and the second loop was to fit the logistic regression on the movie sentiment.  While we did not increase the sentiment prediction accuracy by much  still slightly under  60% , we have successfully implemented the concatenation version of Doc2vec on the  movie corpus. To increase our accuracy, we should try different parameters for the Doc2vec  embeddings and possibly a more complicated model, as logistic regression may not be able to  capture all the non-linear behavior in natural language.  230   Convolutional Neural  Networks  Convolutional Neural Networks  CNNs  are responsible for the major breakthroughs in image  recognition made in the past few years. In this chapter we will cover:   f Implementing a Simpler CNN  f Implementing an Advanced CNN  f Retraining Existing CNN models  f Applying Stylenet Neural-Style  f Implementing DeepDream  As a reminder, the reader may find all of the code for this chapter available online here:  https:  github.com nfmcclure tensorflow_cookbook.  8  231   Introduction In mathematics, a convolution is a function which is applied over the output of another  function. In our case, we will consider applying a matrix multiplication  filter  across an image.  See the following diagram for a conceptual understanding of how image convolution can work:  Figure 1: How a convolutional filter applied across an image  length by width by depth  operates to create a new  feature layer. Here we have a 2x2 convolutional filter, operating in the valid spaces of the 5x5 input with stride 1 in   both directions. The result is a 4x4 matrix.  Convolutional neural networks also have other operations that fulfill other necessities, such  as introducing non-linearities  ReLU , or aggregating parameters  maxpool , and other similar  operations.The preceding image is an example of applying a convolution operation on a 5x5  array with the convolutional filter being a 2x2 matrix. The step size is 1 and we only consider  valid placements. The trainable variables in this operation would be the 2x2 filter weights.  After a convolution, it is common to follow up with an aggregation operation, like maxpool. The  following diagram provides an example of how maxpool operates:  232   Figure 2: An example of how a max-pool operation could operate. Here we have a 2x2 window, operating on the valid   spaces of a 4x4 input with stride 2 in both directions. The result is a 2x2 matrix.  Although we will start by creating our own CNN for image recognition, it is highly  recommended to use existing architectures, as we will do in the remainder of the chapter.  It is common to take a pre-trained network and retrain it with a new  dataset with a new fully connected layer at the end. This method is  very useful and we will illustrate it in, the Retraining existing CNN  models recipe, where we will retrain an existing architecture to  improve on our CIFAR-10 predictions.  Implementing a Simpler CNN In this recipe, we will develop a four-layer convolutional neural network to improve upon  our accuracy in predicting the MNIST digits. The first two convolution layers will each be  compromised of Convolution-ReLU-maxpool operations and the final two layers will be fully  connected layers.  Getting ready To access the MNIST data, TensorFlow has a contrib package that has great dataset loading  functionalities. After we load the data, we will setup our model variables, create the model,  train the model in batches, and then visualize loss, accuracy, and some sample digits.  How to do it…  1.  First, we'll load the necessary libraries and start a graph session:  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow.contrib.learn.python.learn.datasets.mnist import  read_data_sets sess = tf.Session    233   2.  Next, we will load the data and transform the images into 28x28 arrays:  data_dir = 'temp' mnist = read_data_sets data_dir  train_xdata = np.array [np.reshape x,  28,28   for x in mnist. train.images]  test_xdata = np.array [np.reshape x,  28,28   for x in mnist.test. images]  train_labels = mnist.train.labels test_labels = mnist.test.labels  Note that the MNIST data set downloaded here also includes a  validation set. This validation set is the same size as the  test set. If we do any hyperparameter tuning or model selection, it  would be wise to load this in as well for additional testing.  3.  Now we'll set the model parameters. Remember that the depth of the image  number   of channels  is 1 because these images are grayscale: batch_size = 100 learning_rate = 0.005 evaluation_size = 500 image_width = train_xdata[0].shape[0] image_height = train_xdata[0].shape[1] target_size = max train_labels  + 1 num_channels = 1 generations = 500 eval_every = 5 conv1_features = 25 conv2_features = 50 max_pool_size1 = 2 max_pool_size2 = 2 fully_connected_size1 = 100  4.  We can now declare our placeholders for the data. We'll declare our training data   variables and our test data variables. We will have different batch sizes for training  and evaluation sizes. You may change these depending on the physical memory you  have available for training and evaluating: x_input_shape =  batch_size, image_width, image_height, num_ channels  x_input = tf.placeholder tf.float32, shape=x_input_shape  y_target = tf.placeholder tf.int32, shape= batch_size   eval_input_shape =  evaluation_size, image_width, image_height,  num_channels  eval_input = tf.placeholder tf.float32, shape=eval_input_shape  eval_target = tf.placeholder tf.int32, shape= evaluation_size    234   5.  We'll declare our convolution weights and biases with the parameters we set up in the   previous steps: conv1_weight = tf.Variable tf.truncated_normal [4, 4, num_ channels, conv1_features], stddev=0.1, dtype=tf.float32   conv1_bias = tf.Variable tf.zeros [conv1_features],dtype=tf. float32   conv2_weight = tf.Variable tf.truncated_normal [4, 4, conv1_ features, conv2_features], stddev=0.1, dtype=tf.float32   conv2_bias = tf.Variable tf.zeros [conv2_features],dtype=tf. float32    6.  Next, we are going to declare our fully connected weights and biases for the last two   layers of the model: resulting_width = image_width     max_pool_size1 * max_pool_size2  resulting_height = image_height     max_pool_size1 * max_pool_ size2  full1_input_size = resulting_width * resulting_height*conv2_ features full1_weight = tf.Variable tf.truncated_normal [full1_input_size,  fully_connected_size1], stddev=0.1, dtype=tf.float32   full1_bias = tf.Variable tf.truncated_normal [fully_connected_ size1], stddev=0.1, dtype=tf.float32   full2_weight = tf.Variable tf.truncated_normal [fully_connected_ size1, target_size], stddev=0.1, dtype=tf.float32   full2_bias = tf.Variable tf.truncated_normal [target_size],  stddev=0.1, dtype=tf.float32    7.  Now we'll declare our model. We do this, first, by creating a model function. Note that   the function will look in the global scope for the layer weights and biases necessary.  Also, to get the fully connected layer to work, we transform the output of the second  convolutional layer to be flat, so we can use it in the fully connected layer: def my_conv_net input_data :      First Conv-ReLU-MaxPool Layer     conv1 = tf.nn.conv2d input_data, conv1_weight, strides=[1, 1,  1, 1], padding='SAME'      relu1 = tf.nn.relu tf.nn.bias_add conv1, conv1_bias       max_pool1 = tf.nn.max_pool relu1, ksize=[1, max_pool_size1,  max_pool_size1, 1], strides=[1, max_pool_size1, max_pool_size1,  1], padding='SAME'       Second Conv-ReLU-MaxPool Layer     conv2 = tf.nn.conv2d max_pool1, conv2_weight, strides=[1, 1,  1, 1], padding='SAME'      relu2 = tf.nn.relu tf.nn.bias_add conv2, conv2_bias       max_pool2 = tf.nn.max_pool relu2, ksize=[1, max_pool_size2,  max_pool_size2, 1], strides=[1, max_pool_size2, max_pool_size2,  1], padding='SAME'   235        Transform Output into a 1xN layer for next fully connected  layer     final_conv_shape = max_pool2.get_shape  .as_list       final_shape = final_conv_shape[1] * final_conv_shape[2] *  final_conv_shape[3]     flat_output = tf.reshape max_pool2, [final_conv_shape[0],  final_shape]       First Fully Connected Layer     fully_connected1 = tf.nn.relu tf.add tf.matmul flat_output,  full1_weight , full1_bias        Second Fully Connected Layer     final_model_output = tf.add tf.matmul fully_connected1, full2_ weight , full2_bias      return final_model_output   8.  Next, we can declare the model on the training and test data:  model_output = my_conv_net x_input  test_model_output = my_conv_net eval_input   9.  The loss function we will use is the softmax function. We use a sparse softmax  because our predictions will be only one category and not multiple categories. We  are also going to use a loss function that operates on logits and not the scaled  probabilities: loss = tf.reduce_mean tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_ logits model_output, y_target    10.  Next, we'll create a training and test_prediction function. Then, we will also   create an accuracy function to determine how accurate the model is on each batch: prediction = tf.nn.softmax model_output  test_prediction = tf.nn.softmax test_model_output   Create accuracy function def get_accuracy logits, targets :     batch_predictions = np.argmax logits, axis=1      num_correct = np.sum np.equal batch_predictions, targets   return 100. * num_correct batch_predictions.shape[0]   11.  Now we can create the optimizer function, declare the training step and initialize   all the model variables: my_optimizer = tf.train.MomentumOptimizer learning_rate, 0.9  train_step = my_optimizer.minimize loss   Initialize Variables init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   236   12. We can now start training our model. We loop through the data in randomly chosen   batches. Every so often, we choose to evaluate the model on the train and test  batches and record the accuracy and loss. We can see that, after 500 generations,  we quickly achieve 96%-97% accuracy on the test data: train_loss = [] train_acc = [] test_acc = [] for i in range generations :     rand_index = np.random.choice len train_xdata , size=batch_ size      rand_x = train_xdata[rand_index]     rand_x = np.expand_dims rand_x, 3      rand_y = train_labels[rand_index]     train_dict = {x_input: rand_x, y_target: rand_y}     sess.run train_step, feed_dict=train_dict      temp_train_loss, temp_train_preds = sess.run [loss,  prediction], feed_dict=train_dict      temp_train_acc = get_accuracy temp_train_preds, rand_y      if  i+1  % eval_every == 0:         eval_index = np.random.choice len test_xdata ,  size=evaluation_size          eval_x = test_xdata[eval_index]         eval_x = np.expand_dims eval_x, 3          eval_y = test_labels[eval_index]         test_dict = {eval_input: eval_x, eval_target: eval_y}         test_preds = sess.run test_prediction, feed_dict=test_ dict          temp_test_acc = get_accuracy test_preds, eval_y           Record and print results         train_loss.append temp_train_loss          train_acc.append temp_train_acc          test_acc.append temp_test_acc          acc_and_loss = [ i+1 , temp_train_loss, temp_train_acc,  temp_test_acc]         acc_and_loss = [np.round x,2  for x in acc_and_loss]  13.  This results in the following output:  print 'Generation  {}. Train Loss: {:.2f}. Train Acc  Test Acc :  {:.2f}  {:.2f} '.format *acc_and_loss   Generation  5. Train Loss: 2.37.

Here is the code to plot the loss and accuracies using Matplotlib:  eval_indices = range 0, generations, eval_every   Plot loss over time plt.plot eval_indices, train_loss, 'k-'  plt.title 'Softmax Loss per Generation'  plt.xlabel 'Generation'  plt.ylabel 'Softmax Loss'  plt.show    Plot train and test accuracy plt.plot eval_indices, train_acc, 'k-', label='Train Set  Accuracy'  plt.plot eval_indices, test_acc, 'r--', label='Test Set Accuracy'  plt.title 'Train and Test Accuracy'  plt.xlabel 'Generation'  plt.ylabel 'Accuracy'   plt.legend loc='lower right'  plt.show    Figure 3: The left plot is the train and test set accuracy across our 500 training generations.

If we want to plot a sample of the latest batch results, here is the code to plot a   sample of six of the latest results:  Plot the 6 of the last batch results: actuals = rand_y[0:6] predictions = np.argmax temp_train_preds,axis=1 [0:6] images = np.squeeze rand_x[0:6]  Nrows = 2 Ncols = 3 for i in range 6 :     plt.subplot Nrows, Ncols, i+1      plt.imshow np.reshape images[i], [28,28] , cmap='Greys_r'      plt.title 'Actual: ' + str actuals[i]  + ' Pred: ' + str predi ctions[i] ,fontsize=10      frame = plt.gca       frame.axes.get_xaxis  .set_visible False      frame.axes.get_yaxis  .set_visible False   Figure 4: A plot of six random images with the actual and predicted values in the title. The lower right picture was   predicted to be a '3', when in fact it is a '1'.  How it works… We increased our performance on the MNIST dataset and built a model that quickly achieves  about 97% accuracy while training from scratch. Our first two layers are a combination of  convolutions, ReLU, and maxpooling. The second two layers are fully connected layers. We  trained in batches of size 100 and looked at the accuracy and loss across the generations we  trained. Finally, we also plotted six random digits and the predictions actuals for each.  239   A convolutional neural network does very well with image recognition. Part of the reason for  this is that the convolutional layer creates its own low-level features that are activated when  they come across part of the image that is important. This type of model creates features on  its own and uses them for prediction.  There's more… CNN models have made vast strides in the past few years in image recognition. There are  many novel ideas being explored and new architectures are discovered very frequently. A great  repository of papers in this field is a repository website called Arxiv.org  https:  arxiv. org  , which is created and maintained by Cornell University. Arxiv.org includes some very  recent papers in many fields, including computer science and computer science subfields like  Computer Vision and Image Recognition  https:  arxiv.org list cs.CV recent .  See also There are other great resources for learning about convolutional neural networks. Here is a list  of some great resources:   f Stanford University has a great wiki at: http:  scarlet.stanford.edu teach   index.php An_Introduction_to_Convolutional_Neural_Networks   f Deep Learning by Michael Nielsen, at: http:    neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com chap6.html   f An Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks by Jianxin Wu at: http:    cs.nju.edu.cn wujx paper CNN.pdf  Implementing an Advanced CNN It is important to be able to extend CNN models for image recognition so that we understand  how to increase the depth of the network. This may increase the accuracy of our predictions if  we have enough data. Extending the depth of CNN networks is done in a standard fashion: we  just repeat the convolution, maxpool, ReLU series until we are satisfied with the depth. Many  of the more accurate image recognition networks operate in this fashion.  Getting ready In this recipe, we will implement a more advanced method of reading image data and use a  larger CNN to do image recognition on the CIFAR10 dataset  https:  www.cs.toronto. edu ~kriz cifar.html . This dataset has 60,000 32x32 images that fall into exactly one  of ten possible classes. The potential classes for the images are airplane, automobile, bird,  cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. You can also refer to the first bullet point of the   See also section.  240   Most image datasets will be too large to fit into memory. What we can do with TensorFlow is set  up an image pipeline to read in a batch at a time from a file. We do this by essentially setting  up an image reader and then creating a batch queue that operates on the image reader.  Also, with image recognition data, it is common to randomly perturb the image before sending  it through for training. Here, we will randomly crop, flip, and change the brightness.  This recipe is an adapted version of the official TensorFlow CIFAR-10 tutorial, which is  available under the See also section at the end of this chapter. We have condensed the  tutorial into one script and will go through it line-by-line and explain all the code that is  necessary. We also revert some constants and parameters to the original cited paper values,  which we will point out in the following appropriated steps.  How to do it…  1.  To start with, we load the necessary libraries and start a graph session:  import os import sys import tarfile import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf from six.moves import urllib sess = tf.Session    2.  Now we'll declare some of the model parameters. Our batch size will be 128  for train  and test . We will output a status every 50 generations and run for a total of 20,000  generations. Every 500 generations, we'll evaluate on a batch of the test data. We'll  then declare some image parameters, height and width, and what size the random  cropped images will take. There are three channels  red, green, and blue , and we  have ten different targets. Then, we'll declare where we will store the data and image  batches from the queue: batch_size = 128 output_every = 50 generations = 20000 eval_every = 500 image_height = 32 image_width = 32 crop_height = 24 crop_width = 24 num_channels = 3 num_targets = 10 data_dir = 'temp' extract_folder = 'cifar-10-batches-bin'  241   3.   It is recommended to lower the learning rate as we progress towards a good model,  so we will exponentially decrease the learning rate: the initial learning rate will  be set at 0.1, and we will exponentially decrease it by a factor of 10% every 250   where x is the current  generations. The exact formula will be given by  generation number. The default is for this to continually decrease, but TensorFlow  does accept a staircase argument which only updates the learning rate: learning_rate = 0.1 lr_decay = 0.9 num_gens_to_wait = 250.  4.  Now we'll set up parameters so that we can read in the binary CIFAR-10 images:  image_vec_length = image_height * image_width * num_channels record_length = 1 + image_vec_length  5.  Next, we'll set up the data directory and the URL to download the CIFAR-10 images, if   we don't have them already: data_dir = 'temp' if not os.path.exists data_dir :     os.makedirs data_dir  cifar10_url = 'http:  www.cs.toronto.edu ~kriz cifar-10-binary. tar.gz' data_file = os.path.join data_dir, 'cifar-10-binary.tar.gz'  if not os.path.isfile data_file :      Download file     filepath, _ = urllib.request.urlretrieve cifar10_url, data_ file, progress       Extract file     tarfile.open filepath, 'r:gz' .extractall data_dir   6.  We'll set up the record reader and return a randomly distorted image with the   following read_cifar_files   function. First, we need to declare a record reader  object that will read in a fixed length of bytes. After we read the image queue, we'll  split apart the image and label. Finally, we will randomly distort the image with  TensorFlow's built in image modification functions: def read_cifar_files filename_queue, distort_images = True :     reader = tf.FixedLengthRecordReader record_bytes=record_ length      key, record_string = reader.read filename_queue      record_bytes = tf.decode_raw record_string, tf.uint8       Extract label     image_label = tf.cast tf.slice record_bytes, [0], [1] ,  tf.int32       Extract image  242       image_extracted = tf.reshape tf.slice record_bytes, [1],  [image_vec_length] , [num_channels, image_height, image_width]       Reshape image     image_uint8image = tf.transpose image_extracted, [1, 2, 0]      reshaped_image = tf.cast image_uint8image, tf.float32       Randomly Crop image     final_image = tf.image.resize_image_with_crop_or_pad reshaped_ image, crop_width, crop_height      if distort_images:          Randomly flip the image horizontally, change the  brightness and contrast         final_image = tf.image.random_flip_left_right final_image          final_image = tf.image.random_brightness final_image,max_ delta=63          final_image = tf.image.random_contrast final_ image,lower=0.2, upper=1.8      Normalize whitening     final_image = tf.image.per_image_whitening final_image      return final_image, image_label   7.  Now we'll declare a function that will populate our image pipeline for the batch  processor to use. We first need to set up the file list of images we want to read  through, and to define how to read them with an input producer object, created  through prebuilt TensorFlow functions. The input producer can be passed into the  reading function that we created in the preceding step, read_cifar_files  . We'll  then set a batch reader on the queue, shuffle_batch  : def input_pipeline batch_size, train_logical=True :     if train_logical:         files = [os.path.join data_dir, extract_folder, 'data_ batch_{}.bin'.format i   for i in range 1,6 ]     else:         files = [os.path.join data_dir, extract_folder, 'test_ batch.bin' ]     filename_queue = tf.train.string_input_producer files      image, label = read_cifar_files filename_queue       min_after_dequeue = 1000     capacity = min_after_dequeue + 3 * batch_size     example_batch, label_batch = tf.train.shuffle_batch [image,  label], batch_size, capacity, min_after_dequeue      return example_batch, label_batch   243   It is important to set the min_after_dequeue properly. This  parameter is responsible for setting the minimum size of an image  buffer for sampling. The official TensorFlow documentation recommends  setting it to  threads + error margin *batch_size. Note  that setting it to a larger size results in more uniform shuffling, as it is  shuffling from a larger set of data in the queue, but that more memory  will also be used in the process.  8.  Next, we can declare our model function. The model we will use has two   convolutional layers, followed by three fully connected layers. To make variable  declaration easier, we'll start by declaring two variable functions. The two  convolutional layers will create 64 features each. The first fully connected layer  will connect the 2nd convolutional layer with 384 hidden nodes. The second fully  connected operation will connect those 384 hidden nodes to 192 hidden nodes. The  final hidden layer operation will then connect the 192 nodes to the 10 output classes  we are trying to predict.

Now we'll create the loss function. We will use the softmax function because a   picture can only take on exactly one category, so the output should be a probability  distribution over the ten targets: def cifar_loss logits, targets :      Get rid of extra dimensions and cast targets into integers     targets = tf.squeeze tf.cast targets, tf.int32        Calculate cross entropy from logits and targets     cross_entropy = tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_ logits logits, targets       Take the average loss across batch size     cross_entropy_mean = tf.reduce_mean cross_entropy      return cross_entropy_mean   10.  Next, we declare our training step. The learning rate will decrease in an exponential   step function: def train_step loss_value, generation_num :      Our learning rate is an exponential decay  stepped down      model_learning_rate = tf.train.exponential_decay learning_ rate, generation_num, num_gens_to_wait, lr_decay, staircase=True       Create optimizer     my_optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer model_ learning_rate       Initialize train step     train_step = my_optimizer.minimize loss_value      return train_step   246   11.  We must also have an accuracy function that calculates the accuracy across a batch  of images. We'll input the logits and target vectors, and output an averaged accuracy.  We can then use this for both the train and test batches: def accuracy_of_batch logits, targets :      Make sure targets are integers and drop extra dimensions     targets = tf.squeeze tf.cast targets, tf.int32        Get predicted values by finding which logit is the greatest     batch_predictions = tf.cast tf.argmax logits, 1 , tf.int32       Check if they are equal across the batch     predicted_correctly = tf.equal batch_predictions, targets       Average the 1's and 0's  True's and False's  across the  batch size     accuracy = tf.reduce_mean tf.cast predicted_correctly,  tf.float32       return accuracy   12. Now that we have an imagepipeline function, we can initialize both the training   image pipeline and the test image pipeline: images, targets = input_pipeline batch_size, train_logical=True  test_images, test_targets = input_pipeline batch_size, train_ logical=False   13.  Next, we'll initialize the model for the training output and the test output. It is   important to note that we must declare scope.reuse_variables   after we  create the training model so that, when we declare the model for the test network, it  will use the same model parameters: with tf.variable_scope 'model_definition'  as scope:      Declare the training network model     model_output = cifar_cnn_model images, batch_size       Use same variables within scope     scope.reuse_variables        Declare test model output     test_output = cifar_cnn_model test_images, batch_size   14.  We can now initialize our loss and test accuracy functions. Then we'll declare the   generation variable. This variable needs to be declared as non-trainable, and passed  to our training function that uses it in the learning rate exponential decay calculation: loss = cifar_loss model_output, targets  accuracy = accuracy_of_batch test_output, test_targets  generation_num = tf.Variable 0, trainable=False  train_op = train_step loss, generation_num   247   15.  We'll now initialize all of the model's variables and then start the image pipeline by  running the TensorFlow function, start_queue_runners  . When we start the  train or test model output, the pipeline will feed in a batch of images in place of a  feed dictionary: init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init  tf.train.start_queue_runners sess=sess   16.  We now loop through our training generations and save the training loss and the    test accuracy: train_loss = [] test_accuracy = [] for i in range generations :     _, loss_value = sess.run [train_op, loss]      if  i+1  % output_every == 0:         train_loss.append loss_value          output = 'Generation {}: Loss = {:.5f}'.format  i+1 ,  loss_value          print output      if  i+1  % eval_every == 0:         [temp_accuracy] = sess.run [accuracy]          test_accuracy.append temp_accuracy          acc_output = ' --- Test Accuracy=  {:.2f}%.'.format 100.*temp_accuracy          print acc_output   17.  This results in the following output:  Generation 19500: Loss = 0.04461  --- Test Accuracy = 80.47%. Generation 19550: Loss = 0.01171 Generation 19600: Loss = 0.06911 Generation 19650: Loss = 0.08629 Generation 19700: Loss = 0.05296 Generation 19750: Loss = 0.03462 Generation 19800: Loss = 0.03182 Generation 19850: Loss = 0.07092 Generation 19900: Loss = 0.11342 Generation 19950: Loss = 0.08751 Generation 20000: Loss = 0.02228  --- Test Accuracy = 83.59%.  248   18.  Finally, here is some matplotlib code that will plot the loss and test accuracy over   the course of the training: eval_indices = range 0, generations, eval_every  output_indices = range 0, generations, output_every   Plot loss over time plt.plot output_indices, train_loss, 'k-'  plt.title 'Softmax Loss per Generation'  plt.xlabel 'Generation'  plt.ylabel 'Softmax Loss'  plt.show    Plot accuracy over time plt.plot eval_indices, test_accuracy, 'k-'  plt.title 'Test Accuracy'  plt.xlabel 'Generation'  plt.ylabel 'Accuracy'  plt.show    Figure 5: The training loss is on the left and the test accuracy is on the right. For the CIFAR-10 image recognition CNN,   we were able to achieve a model that reaches around 75% accuracy on the test set.  How it works… After we downloaded the CIFAR-10 data, we established an image pipeline instead of using a  feed dictionary. For more information on the image pipeline, please see the official TensorFlow  CIFAR-10 tutorials. We used this train and test pipeline to try to predict the correct category of  the images. By the end, the model had achieved around 75% accuracy on the test set.  249   See also   f For more information about the CIFAR-10 dataset, please see Learning Multiple   Layers of Features from Tiny Images, Alex Krizhevsky, 2009. https:  www. cs.toronto.edu ~kriz learning-features-2009-TR.pdf   f To see original TensorFlow code, visit https:  github.com tensorflow   tensorflow tree r0.11 tensorflow models image cifar10   f For more on local response normalization, please see, ImageNet Classification  with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, Krizhevsky, A., et. al. 2012. http:   papers.nips.cc paper 4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep- convolutional-neural-networks  Retraining Existing CNNs models Training a new image recognition from scratch requires a lot of time and computational  power. If we can take a prior trained network and retrain it with our images, it could save us  computational time. For this recipe, we will show how to use a pre-trained TensorFlow image  recognition model and fine-tune it to work on a different set of images.  Getting ready Training a new image recognition from scratch requires a lot of time and computational  power. If we can take a prior trained network and retrain it with our images, it could save us  computational time. The idea is to reuse the weights and structure of a prior model from the  convolutional layers and retrain the fully connected layers at the top of the network.  TensorFlow has created a tutorial about training on top of existing CNN models  refer to  the first bullet point of the See also section . In this recipe, we will illustrate how to use  the same methodology for CIFAR-10. The CNN network we are going to employ uses a very  popular architecture called Inception. The Inception CNN model was created by Google and  has performed very well in many image recognition benchmarks. For details, see the paper  referenced in the second bullet point of See also section.  The main Python script we will cover shows how to download the CIFAR-10 image data and  automatically separate, label, and save the images into the ten classes in each of the train  and test folders. After that, we will reiterate how to train the network on our images.  250   1.  We'll start by loading the necessary libraries for downloading, unzipping, and saving   How to do it…  the CIFAR-10 images: import os import tarfile import _pickle as cPickle import numpy as np import urllib.request import scipy.misc  2.  We now declare the CIFAR-10 data link and make the temporary directory we will  store the data in. We'll also declare the ten categories to reference for saving the  images later on: cifar_link = 'https:  www.cs.toronto.edu ~kriz cifar-10-python. tar.gz' data_dir = 'temp' if not os.path.isdir data_dir :     os.makedirs data_dir  objects = ['airplane', 'automobile', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog',  'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck']  3.  Now we'll download the CIFAR-10 .tar data file, and un-tar the file:  target_file = os.path.join data_dir, 'cifar-10-python.tar.gz'  if not os.path.isfile target_file :     print 'CIFAR-10 file not found. Downloading CIFAR data  Size =  163MB '      print 'This may take a few minutes, please wait.'      filename, headers = urllib.request.urlretrieve cifar_link,  target_file   Extract into memory tar = tarfile.open target_file  tar.extractall path=data_dir  tar.close    4.  We now create the necessary folder structure for training. The temporary directory will   have two folders, train_dir and validation_dir. In each of these folders, we  will create the ten sub-folders for each category:  Create train image folders train_folder = 'train_dir' if not os.path.isdir os.path.join data_dir, train_folder  :     for i in range 10 :         folder = os.path.join data_dir, train_folder, objects[i]   251           os.makedirs folder   Create test image folders test_folder = 'validation_dir' if not os.path.isdir os.path.join data_dir, test_folder  :     for i in range 10 :         folder = os.path.join data_dir, test_folder, objects[i]          os.makedirs folder   5.   In order to save the images, we will create a function that will load them from memory  and store them in an image dictionary: def load_batch_from_file file :     file_conn = open file, 'rb'      image_dictionary = cPickle.load file_conn, encoding='latin1'      file_conn.close       return image_dictionary   6.  With the above dictionary, we will save each of the files in the correct location with   the following function: def save_images_from_dict image_dict, folder='data_dir' :      for ix, label in enumerate image_dict['labels'] :         folder_path = os.path.join data_dir, folder,  objects[label]          filename = image_dict['filenames'][ix]         Transform image data         image_array = image_dict['data'][ix]         image_array.resize [3, 32, 32]           Save image         output_location = os.path.join folder_path, filename          scipy.misc.imsave output_location,image_array.transpose     7.  With the preceding functions, we can loop through the downloaded data files and   save each image to the correct location: data_location = os.path.join data_dir, 'cifar-10-batches-py'  train_names = ['data_batch_' + str x  for x in range 1,6 ] test_names = ['test_batch']  Sort train images for file in train_names:     print 'Saving images from file: {}'.format file       file_location = os.path.join data_dir, 'cifar-10-batches-py',  file      image_dict = load_batch_from_file file_location      save_images_from_dict image_dict, folder=train_folder   Sort test images  252   for file in test_names:     print 'Saving images from file: {}'.format file       file_location = os.path.join data_dir, 'cifar-10-batches-py',  file      image_dict = load_batch_from_file file_location      save_images_from_dict image_dict, folder=test_folder   8.  The last part of our script creates the label file, and this is the last piece of   information that we will need. This file will let us interpret the outputs as labels  instead of the numerical indices: cifar_labels_file = os.path.join data_dir,'cifar10_labels.txt'  print 'Writing labels file, {}'.format cifar_labels_file   with open cifar_labels_file, 'w'  as labels_file:     for item in objects:         labels_file.write "{}\n".format item    9.  When the above script is run, it will download the images and sort them into the   correct folder structure that the TensorFlow retraining tutorial expects. Once we have  done this, we just follow the tutorial accordingly. First we should clone the tutorial  repository: git clone https:  github.com tensorflow models tree master  inception inception  10.  In order to use a prior trained model, we must download the network weights and   apply it to our model: me@computer:~$ curl -O http:  download.tensorflow.org models  image imagenet inception-v3-2016-03-01.tar.gz me@computer:~$ tar xzf inception-v3-2016-03-01.tar.gz  11.  Now that we have the images in the correct folder structure, we have to turn them   into a TFRecords object. We do this by running the following commands: me@computer:~$ python3 data build_image_data.py  --train_directory="temp train_dir "  --validation_directory="temp validation_dir"  --output_directory="temp " --labels_file="temp cifar10_labels.txt"  12. Now we'll train the model using bazel, setting the parameter ' to true. This script  outputs the loss every 10 generations. We can kill this process at any time and the  model output will be in the folder temp training_results. We can load the  model from this folder for evaluation: me@computer:~$ bazel-bin inception flowers_train  --train_dir="temp training_results" --data_dir="temp data_dir"  253   --pretrained_model_checkpoint_path="model.ckpt-157585"  --fine_tune=True --initial_learning_rate=0.001  --input_queue_memory_factor=1  13.  This should result in output similar to the following:  2016-09-18 12:16:32.563577: step 1290, loss = 2.02  1.2 examples  sec; 26.965 sec batch   2016-09-18 12:25:41.316540: step 1300, loss = 2.01  1.2 examples  sec; 26.357 sec batch   How it works… The official TensorFlow tutorial for training on top of a pre-trained CNN requires a folder  setup that we created from the CIFAR-10 data. We then converted the data into the required  TFRecords format and started training the model. Remember that we are fine-tuning the  model and retraining the fully connected layers at the top to fit our 10-category data.

Stylenet is a procedure that attempts to learn an  image style from one picture and apply it to a second picture while keeping the second image  structure  or content . This may be possible if we can find intermediate CNN nodes that  correlate strongly with a style separately from the content of the image.  Getting ready Stylenet is a procedure that takes two images and applies the style of one image to the  content of the second image. It is based on a famous paper in 2015, A Neural Algorithm  of Artistic Style  refer to the first bullet point under See also section . The authors found a  property of some CNNs where intermediate layers exist that seem to encode the style of a  picture and some encode the content of the picture. To this end, if we train the style layers  on the style picture and the content layers on the original image, and back-propagate those  calculated losses, we can change the original image to be more like the style image.  254   In order to accomplish this, we will download the recommended network from the paper,  called the imagenet-vgg-19. There is also an imagenet-vgg-16 network that works as well,   but the paper recommends imagenet-vgg-19.  How to do it…  1.  First, we'll download the pretrained network in *.mat format. The mat format is a   matlab object, and the scipy package in Python has a method that can read it. The  link to download the mat object is here. We save this model in the same folder our  Python script is for reference: http:  www.vlfeat.org matconvnet models beta16 imagenet-vgg- verydeep-19.mat  2.  We'll start our Python script by loading the necessary libraries:  import os import scipy.misc import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf  3.  Then we can start a graph session and declare the locations of our two images: the   original image and the style image. For our purposes, we will use the cover image  of this book for the original image; for the style image, we will use Starry Night by  Vincent van Gough. Feel free to use any two pictures you want here. If you choose to  use these pictures, they are available on the book's github site, https:  github. com nfmcclure tensorflow_cookbook  Navigate tostyelnet section : sess = tf.Session   original_image_file = 'temp book_cover.jpg' style_image_file = 'temp starry_night.jpg'  4.  We'll set some parameters for our model: the location of the mat file, weights, the   learning rate, number of generations, and how frequently we should output the  intermediate image. For the weights, it helps to highly weight the style image over the  original image. These hyperparameters should be tuned for changes in the desired  result: vgg_path ='imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat' original_image_weight = 5.0 style_image_weight = 200.0 regularization_weight = 50.0 learning_rate = 0.1 generations = 10000 output_generations = 500  255   5.  Now we'll load the two images with scipy and change the style image to fit the   original image dimensions: original_image = scipy.misc.imread original_image_file  style_image = scipy.misc.imread style_image_file   Get shape of target and make the style image the same target_shape = original_image.shape style_image = scipy.misc.imresize style_image, target_shape[1]    style_image.shape[1]   6.  From the paper, we can define the layers in order of how they appeared. We'll use the   author's naming convention: vgg_layers = ['conv1_1', 'relu1_1', 'conv1_2', 'relu1_2', 'pool1', 'conv2_1', 'relu2_1', 'conv2_2', 'relu2_2', 'pool2', 'conv3_1', 'relu3_1', 'conv3_2', 'relu3_2', 'conv3_3', 'relu3_3', 'conv3_4', 'relu3_4', 'pool3', 'conv4_1', 'relu4_1', 'conv4_2', 'relu4_2', 'conv4_3', 'relu4_3', 'conv4_4', 'relu4_4', 'pool4', 'conv5_1', 'relu5_1', 'conv5_2', 'relu5_2', 'conv5_3', 'relu5_3', 'conv5_4', 'relu5_4']  7.  Now we'll define a function that will extract the parameters from the mat file:  def extract_net_info path_to_params :     vgg_data = scipy.io.loadmat path_to_params      normalization_matrix = vgg_data['normalization'][0][0][0]     mat_mean = np.mean normalization_matrix, axis= 0,1       network_weights = vgg_data['layers'][0]     return mat_mean, network_weights   8.  From the loaded weights and the layer definitions, we can recreate the network in  TensorFlow with the following function. We'll loop through each layer and assign the  corresponding function with appropriate weights and biases, where applicable: def vgg_network network_weights, init_image :     network = {}     image = init_image     for i, layer in enumerate vgg_layers :         if layer[1] == 'c':  256               weights, bias = network_weights[i][0][0][0][0]             weights = np.transpose weights,  1, 0, 2, 3               bias = bias.reshape -1              conv_layer = tf.nn.conv2d image, tf.constant weights ,   1, 1, 1, 1 , 'SAME'              image = tf.nn.bias_add conv_layer, bias          elif layer[1] == 'r':             image = tf.nn.relu image          else:             image = tf.nn.max_pool image,  1, 2, 2, 1 ,  1, 2, 2,  1 , 'SAME'          network[layer] = image     return network   9.  The paper recommends a few strategies of assigning intermediate layers to the   original and style images. While we should keep relu4_2 for the original image, we  can try different combinations of the other reluX_1 layer outputs for the style image: original_layer = 'relu4_2' style_layers = ['relu1_1', 'relu2_1', 'relu3_1', 'relu4_1',  'relu5_1']  10.  Next, we'll run the above function to get the weights and mean. We'll also change   the image shapes to have four dimensions by adding a dimension of size one to the  beginning. TensorFlow's image operations act on four dimensions, so we must add  the batch-size dimension: normalization_mean, network_weights = extract_net_info vgg_path  shape =  1,  + original_image.shape style_shape =  1,  + style_image.shape original_features = {} style_features = {}  11.  Next, we declare the image placeholder and create the network with that placeholder:  image = tf.placeholder 'float', shape=shape  vgg_net = vgg_network network_weights, image   12. We now normalize the original image matrix and run it through the network:  original_minus_mean = original_image - normalization_mean original_norm = np.array [original_minus_mean]  original_features[original_layer] = sess.run vgg_net[original_ layer], feed_dict={image: original_norm}   257   13.  We repeat the same procedure with each of the style layers that we chose in Step 9:  image = tf.placeholder 'float', shape=style_shape  vgg_net = vgg_network network_weights, image  style_minus_mean = style_image - normalization_mean style_norm = np.array [style_minus_mean]  for layer in style_layers:     layer_output = sess.run vgg_net[layer], feed_dict={image:  style_norm}      layer_output = np.reshape layer_output,  -1, layer_output. shape[3]       style_gram_matrix = np.matmul layer_output.T, layer_output     layer_output.size     style_features[layer] = style_gram_matrix  14.  In order to create the combined image, we'll start with random noise and run it   through the network: initial = tf.random_normal shape  * 0.05 image = tf.Variable initial  vgg_net = vgg_network network_weights, image   15.  We now declare the first loss, the loss on the original image. We use the size-  normalized l2-loss between the output of the normalized original image from step 12  and the output of the layer designated to represent the original content from step 9: original_loss = original_image_weight *  2 * tf.nn.l2_loss vgg_ net[original_layer] - original_features[original_layer]    original_features[original_layer].size   16.  Now we calculate the same type of loss for each style layer:  style_loss = 0 style_losses = [] for style_layer in style_layers:     layer = vgg_net[style_layer]     feats, height, width, channels = [x.value for x in layer.get_ shape  ]     size = height * width * channels     features = tf.reshape layer,  -1, channels       style_gram_matrix = tf.matmul tf.transpose features ,  features    size     style_expected = style_features[style_layer]     style_losses.append 2 * tf.nn.l2_loss style_gram_matrix -  style_expected    style_expected.size  style_loss += style_image_weight * tf.reduce_sum style_losses   258   17.  The third loss term is called the total variation loss. This comes from calculating the  total variation. It is similar to total variation denoising, in that true images have very  low local variation, and images with high noise have high local variation. The key term  in the following code is the second_term_numerator, which subtracts off nearby  pixels. Images with high noise will have high differences and we can treat this as a  loss function to minimize: total_var_x = sess.run tf.reduce_prod image[:,1:,:,:].get_ shape     total_var_y = sess.run tf.reduce_prod image[:,:,1:,:].get_ shape     first_term = regularization_weight * 2 second_term_numerator = tf.nn.l2_loss image[:,1:,:,:] -  image[:,:shape[1]-1,:,:]  second_term = second_term_numerator   total_var_y third_term =  tf.nn.l2_loss image[:,:,1:,:] -  image[:,:,:shape[2]-1,:]    total_var_x  total_variation_loss = first_term *  second_term + third_term   18.  The total loss we want to minimize is the combined original, style, and total    variation loss: loss = original_loss + style_loss + total_variation_loss  19.  We next declare our optimizer and training step and initialize all the variables    in the model. optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer learning_rate  train_step = optimizer.minimize loss  sess.run tf.initialize_all_variables     20. We now loop through our training generations and print a status update every so   often and save the temporary image. We'll save the temporary image because  it is hard to determine how far to run this algorithm as it can vary, depending on  the images chosen. It is best to err on the larger generation size, and stop when a  temporary image appears to be a good stopping point: for i in range generations :     sess.run train_step       Print update and save temporary output     if  i+1  % output_generations == 0:         print 'Generation {} out of {}'.format i + 1,  generations           image_eval = sess.run image          best_image_add_mean = image_eval.reshape shape[1:]  +  normalization_mean         output_file = 'temp_output_{}.jpg'.format i          scipy.misc.imsave output_file, best_image_add_mean   259   21.  At the end of the algorithm, we'll save the final output:  image_eval = sess.run image  best_image_add_mean = image_eval.reshape shape[1:]  +  normalization_mean output_file = 'final_output.jpg' scipy.misc.imsave output_file, best_image_add_mean   Figure 6: Using the stylenet algorithm to combine the book cover image with Starry Night. Note that different style   emphases can be used by changing the weighting at the beginning of the script.  How it works… We first loaded the two images, then loaded the pre-trained network weights and assigned  layers to the original and style images. We calculated three loss functions: an original image  loss, a style loss, and a total variation loss. Then we trained random noise pictures to have the  style of the style image and the content of the original image.  260   See also   f A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style by Gatys, Ecker, Bethge. 2015. https:  arxiv.  org abs 1508.06576.  Implementing DeepDream Another usage of trained CNNs is exploiting the fact that some of the intermediate nodes  detect features of labels  e.g. a cat ear or a feather of a bird . Using this fact, we can find   ways to transform any image to reflect those node features of any node we choose. For this  recipe, we will go through the DeepDream tutorial on TensorFlow's website. But for this recipe,  we will go through the essential parts in much more detail. The hope is that we can prepare  the reader to use the DeepDream algorithm for exploration of CNNs and features created in  such CNNs.  Getting ready TensorFlow's official tutorials show how to implement DeepDream through a script    refer to the first bullet point of the See also section . The purpose of this recipe is to go  through the script they provide and explain each line. While the tutorial is great, there are  some parts that are skippable and some parts that could use more explanation. We hope  to provide a more detailed line-by-line explanation. We also change the code to be Python 3  compliant where necessary.  How to do it…  1.   In order to get started with DeepDream, we need to download the GoogleNet, which  is CNN trained on CIFAR-1000: me@computer:~$ wget https:  storage.googleapis.com download. tensorflow.org models inception5h.zip  me@computer:~$ unzip inception5h.zip  2.  First, we'll start by loading the necessary libraries and starting a graph session:  import os import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import PIL.Image import tensorflow as tf from io import BytesIO graph = tf.Graph   sess = tf.InteractiveSession graph=graph   261   3.  We now declare the location of the unzipped model parameters  from step 1  and   load the parameters into a TensorFlow graph:  Model location model_fn = 'tensorflow_inception_graph.pb'  Load graph parameters with tf.gfile.FastGFile model_fn, 'rb'  as f:     graph_def = tf.GraphDef       graph_def.ParseFromString f.read     4.  We create a placeholder for the input, save the imagenet mean value of 117.0, and   then we import the graph definition with the normalized placeholder:  Create placeholder for input t_input = tf.placeholder np.float32, name='input'   Imagenet average bias to subtract off images imagenet_mean = 117.0 t_preprocessed = tf.expand_dims t_input-imagenet_mean, 0  tf.import_graph_def graph_def, {'input':t_preprocessed}   5.  Next, we will import the convolutional layers to visualize and use for DeepDream   processing later:  Create a list of layers that we can refer to later layers = [op.name for op in graph.get_operations   if  op.type=='Conv2D' and 'import ' in op.name]  Count how many outputs for each layer feature_nums = [int graph.get_tensor_by_name name+':0' .get_ shape  [-1]  for name in layers]  6.  Now we will pick a layer to visualize. We can pick others by name as well. We choose   to look at feature number 139. The image starts with random noise: layer = 'mixed4d_3x3_bottleneck_pre_relu' channel = 139 img_noise = np.random.uniform size= 224,224,3   + 100.0  7.  We declare a function that will plot an image array:  def showarray a, fmt='jpeg' :      First make sure everything is between 0 and 255     a = np.uint8 np.clip a, 0, 1 *255       Pick an in-memory format for image display     f = BytesIO        Create the in memory image     PIL.Image.fromarray a .save f, fmt       Show image     plt.imshow a   262   8.  We'll shorten some repetitive code by creating a function that retrieves a layer by   name from the graph: def T layer : Helper for getting layer output tensor     return graph.get_tensor_by_name "import %s:0"%layer   9.  The next function we will create is a wrapper function for creating placeholders   according to the arguments we specify:  The following function returns a function wrapper that will  create the placeholder  inputs of a specified dtype def tffunc *argtypes : '''Helper that transforms TF-graph generating function into a  regular one.     See "resize" function below. '''     placeholders = list map tf.placeholder, argtypes       def wrap f :         out = f *placeholders          def wrapper *args, **kw :             return out.eval dict zip placeholders, args  ,  session=kw.get 'session'           return wrapper     return wrap  10.  We also need a function that resizes an image to a size specification. We do this   with TensorFlow's built in image linear interpolation function, tf.image.resize. bilinear  :  Helper function that uses TF to resize an image def resize img, size :     img = tf.expand_dims img, 0       Change 'img' size by linear interpolation     return tf.image.resize_bilinear img, size [0,:,:,:]  11.  Now we need a way to update the source image to be more like a feature we select.   We do this by specifying how the gradient on the image is calculated. We define a  function that will calculate gradients on subregions  tiles  over the image to make  the calculations quicker. In order to prevent a tiled output, we will randomly shift, or  roll, the image in the x and y direction, which will smooth out the tiling effect. def calc_grad_tiled img, t_grad, tile_size=512 : '''Compute the value of tensor t_grad over the image in a tiled  way.     Random shifts are applied to the image to blur tile boundaries  over      multiple iterations.'''  263        Pick a subregion square size     sz = tile_size      Get the image height and width     h, w = img.shape[:2]      Get a random shift amount in the x and y direction     sx, sy = np.random.randint sz, size=2       Randomly shift the image  roll image  in the x and y  directions     img_shift = np.roll np.roll img, sx, 1 , sy, 0       Initialize the while image gradient as zeros     grad = np.zeros_like img       Now we loop through all the sub-tiles in the image     for y in range 0, max h-sz  2, sz ,sz :         for x in range 0, max w-sz  2, sz ,sz :              Select the sub image tile             sub = img_shift[y:y+sz,x:x+sz]              Calculate the gradient for the tile             g = sess.run t_grad, {t_input:sub}               Apply the gradient of the tile to the whole image  gradient             grad[y:y+sz,x:x+sz] = g      Return the gradient, undoing the roll operation     return np.roll np.roll grad, -sx, 1 , -sy, 0   12. Now we can declare our DeepDream function. The objective of our algorithm is the   mean of the feature we select. The loss operates on gradients, which will depend  on the distance between the input image and the selected feature. The strategy is  to separate the image into high and low frequency, and calculate gradients on the  low part. The resulting high frequency image is split up again and the processes  is repeated. The set of the original image and the low frequency images are called  octaves. For each pass, we calculate the gradients and apply them to the images: def render_deepdream t_obj, img0=img_noise,                      iter_n=10, step=1.5, octave_n=4, octave_ scale=1.4 :      defining the optimization objective, the objective is the  mean of the feature     t_score = tf.reduce_mean t_obj       Our gradients will be defined as changing the t_input to get  closer tothe values of t_score.  Here, t_score is the mean of the  feature we select.      t_input will be the image octave  starting with the last      t_grad = tf.gradients t_score, t_input [0]  behold the power  of automatic differentiation!

Where residual = image -  Resize lo to  be hw-shape          hi = img-resize lo, hw           Save the lo image for re-iterating         img = lo          Save the extracted hi-image         octaves.append hi        generate details octave by octave     for octave in range octave_n :         if octave>0:              Start with the last octave             hi = octaves[-octave]                          img = resize img, hi.shape[:2] +hi         for i in range iter_n :              Calculate gradient of the image.             g = calc_grad_tiled img, t_grad               Ideally, we would just add the gradient, g, but              we want do a forward step size of it  'step' ,              and divide it by the avg. norm of the gradient, so              we are adding a gradient of a certain size each  step.              Also, to make sure we aren't dividing by zero, we  add 1e-7.             img += g* step    np.abs g .mean  +1e-7               print '.',end = ''          showarray img 255.0   13.

We will start by demonstrating how to use an RNN to predict spam.We will then  introduce a variant of RNNs for creating Shakespeare text.We will finish by creating an RNN  sequence-to-sequence model to translate from English to German:   f Implementing RNNs for Spam Prediction  f Implementing an LSTM Model  f Stacking multiple LSTM Layers  f Creating Sequence-to-Sequence Models  f Training a Siamese Similarity Measure  As a note, all the code to this chapter can be found online at https:  github.com  nfmcclure tensorflow_cookbook.  Introduction Of all the machine-learning algorithms we have considered thus far, none have considered  data as a sequence.To take sequence data into account, we extend neural networks that store  outputs from prior iterations. This type of neural network is called a recurrent neural network   RNN .Consider the fully connected network formulation:  269   Here, the weights are given by Amultiplied by the input layer, x, and then run through an  activation function,   , which gives the output layer, y.If we have a sequence of input data,   , we can adapt the fully connected layer to take prior inputs into account, as follows:  On top of this recurrent iteration to get the next input, we want to get the probability  distribution output, as follows:  Once we have a full sequence output,  or category by just considering the last output.See the following figure for how a general  architecture might work:  , we can consider the target a number   Figure 1: To predict a single number, or a category, we take a sequence of inputs  tokens     and consider the final output as the predicted output.  We can also consider the sequence itself as an output, as a sequence-to-sequence model:  Figure 2: To predict a sequence, we may also feed the outputs back into the model to generate multiple outputs.  270   For arbitrarily long sequences, training with the back-propagation algorithm creates long time- dependent gradients.Because of this, there exists a vanishing or exploding gradient problem.  Later in this chapter, we will explore a solution to this problem by expanding the RNN cell into  what is called a Long Short Term Memory LSTM  cell.The main idea is that the LSTM cell  introduces another operation, called gates, which controls the flow of information through the  sequence. We will go over the details in a later chapters.  When dealing with RNN models for NLP, encoding is a term used to  describe the process of converting data  words or characters in NLP  into  numerical RNN features. The term decoding is the process of converting  the RNN numerical features into output words or characters.  Implementing RNN for Spam Prediction To start we will apply the standard RNN unit to predict a singular numerical output.  Getting ready In this recipe, we will implement a standard RNN in TensorFlow to predict whether or not a  text message is spam or ham. We will use the SMS spam-collection dataset from the ML  repository at UCI.The architecture we will use for prediction will be an input RNN sequence  from the embedded text, and we will take the last RNN output as a prediction of spam or ham   1 or 0 .  How to do it…  1.  We start by loading the libraries necessary for this script:  import os import re import io import requests import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import tensorflow as tf from zipfile import ZipFile  271   2.  Next we start a graph session and set the RNN model parameters. We will run the   data through 20 epochs, in batch sizes of 250.The maximum length of each text  we will consider is 25 words; we will cut longer texts to 25 or zero pad shorter texts. The RNN will be of size 10 units.We will only consider words that appear at least 10  times in our vocabulary, and every word will be embedded in a trainable vector of size  50.The dropout rate will be a placeholder that we can set at 0.5 during training time  or 1.0 during evaluation: sess = tf.Session   epochs = 20 batch_size = 250 max_sequence_length = 25 rnn_size = 10 embedding_size = 50 min_word_frequency = 10 learning_rate = 0.0005 dropout_keep_prob = tf.placeholder tf.float32   3.  Now we get the SMS text data.First, we check if it was already downloaded and, if so,   read in the file.Otherwise, we download the data and save it: data_dir = 'temp' data_file = 'text_data.txt' if not os.path.exists data_dir :     os.makedirs data_dir  if not os.path.isfile os.path.join data_dir, data_file  :     zip_url = 'http:  archive.ics.uci.edu ml machine-learning- databases 00228 smsspamcollection.zip'     r = requests.get zip_url      z = ZipFile io.BytesIO r.content       file = z.read 'SMSSpamCollection'       Format Data     text_data = file.decode       text_data = text_data.encode 'ascii',errors='ignore'      text_data = text_data.decode  .split '\n'       Save data to text file     with open os.path.join data_dir, data_file , 'w'  as file_ conn:         for text in text_data:             file_conn.write "{}\n".format text   else:      Open data from text file     text_data = []     with open os.path.join data_dir, data_file , 'r'  as file_ conn:         for row in file_conn:  272               text_data.append row      text_data = text_data[:-1] text_data = [x.split '\t'  for x in text_data if len x >=1] [text_data_target, text_data_train] = [list x  for x in zip *text_ data ]  4.  To reduce our vocabulary, we will clean the input texts by removing special   characters, extra white space, and putting everything in lowercase: def clean_text text_string :     text_string = re.sub r' [^\s\w]_[0-9] +', '', text_string      text_string = " ".join text_string.split        text_string = text_string.lower       return text_string   Clean texts text_data_train = [clean_text x  for x in text_data_train]  Note that our cleaning step removes special characters. As an  alternative, we could also have replaced them with a space.  Ideally, this depends on the formatting of the dataset.  5.  Now we process the texts with a built-in vocabulary processor function from   TensorFlow.This will convert a text to an appropriate list of indices: vocab_processor = tf.contrib.learn.preprocessing. VocabularyProcessor max_sequence_length,min_frequency=min_word_ frequency  text_processed = np.array list vocab_processor.fit_transform text_ data_train     6.  Next we shuffle the data to randomize the data:  text_processed = np.array text_processed  text_data_target = np.array [1 if x=='ham' else 0 for x in text_ data_target]  shuffled_ix = np.random.permutation np.arange len text_data_ target    x_shuffled = text_processed[shuffled_ix] y_shuffled = text_data_target[shuffled_ix]  7.  We also split the data into an 80-20 train-test dataset:  ix_cutoff = int len y_shuffled *0.80  x_train, x_test = x_shuffled[:ix_cutoff], x_shuffled[ix_cutoff:] y_train, y_test = y_shuffled[:ix_cutoff], y_shuffled[ix_cutoff:] vocab_size = len vocab_processor.vocabulary_  print "Vocabulary Size: {:d}".format vocab_size   print "80-20 Train Test split: {:d} -- {:d}".format len y_train ,  len y_test     273   For this recipe, we will not be doing any hyperparameter tuning. If the reader  goes in this direction, remember to split up the dataset into train-test-valid  sets before proceeding.  A good option for this is the Scikit-learn function  model_selection.train_test_split  .  8.  Next we declare the graph placeholders.The x-input will be a placeholder of size   [None, max_sequence_length], which will be the batch size by the maximum  allowed word length of the text messages.The y-output placeholder is just an integer,  0 or 1, or ham or spam: x_data = tf.placeholder tf.int32, [None, max_sequence_length]  y_output = tf.placeholder tf.int32, [None]   9.  We now create our embedding matrix and embedding lookup operation for the    x-input data: embedding_mat = tf.Variable tf.random_uniform [vocab_size,  embedding_size], -1.0, 1.0   embedding_output = tf.nn.embedding_lookup embedding_mat, x_data   10.  We declare our model as follows.First we initialize a type of RNN cell to use  RNN of   size 10 .Then we create the RNN sequence by making it a dynamic RNN.We then add  dropout to the RNN: cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.BasicRNNCell num_units = rnn_size  output, state = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn cell, embedding_output,  dtype=tf.float32  output = tf.nn.dropout output, dropout_keep_prob   Note, that the dynamic RNN allows for variable length sequences. Even though we are using a fixed sequence length in this example, it  is usually preferred to use the dynamic_rnn in TensorFlow for two  main reasons.The main reason is that, in practice, the dynamic RNN  actually runs computationally faster and that, if we choose, we can  run sequences of different lengths through the RNN.  11.  Now to get our predictions, we have to rearrange the RNN and slice off the last output:  output = tf.transpose output, [1, 0, 2]  last = tf.gather output, int output.get_shape  [0]  - 1   12. To finish the RNN prediction, we convert from the rnn_size output to the    two-category output via a fully connected network layer: weight = tf.Variable tf.truncated_normal [rnn_size, 2],  stddev=0.1   bias = tf.Variable tf.constant 0.1, shape=[2]   logits_out = tf.nn.softmax tf.matmul last, weight  + bias   274   13.  We declare our loss function next.Remember that with using the sparse_softmax   function from TensorFlow, the targets have to be integer indices  of type int , and  the logits have to be floats: losses = tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits logits_ out, y_output  loss = tf.reduce_mean losses   14.  We also need an accuracy function so that we can compare the algorithm on the test   and train set: accuracy = tf.reduce_mean tf.cast tf.equal tf.argmax logits_out,  1 , tf.cast y_output, tf.int64  , tf.float32    15.  Next we create the optimization function and initialize the model variables:  optimizer = tf.train.RMSPropOptimizer learning_rate  train_step = optimizer.minimize loss  init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   16.  Now we can start looping through our data and training the model.When looping   through the data multiple times, it is good practice to shuffle the data every epoch to  prevent over-training: train_loss = [] test_loss = [] train_accuracy = [] test_accuracy = []  Start training for epoch in range epochs :      Shuffle training data     shuffled_ix = np.random.permutation np.arange len x_train        x_train = x_train[shuffled_ix]     y_train = y_train[shuffled_ix]     num_batches = int len x_train  batch_size  + 1     for i in range num_batches :          Select train data         min_ix = i * batch_size         max_ix = np.min [len x_train ,   i+1  * batch_size ]          x_train_batch = x_train[min_ix:max_ix]         y_train_batch = y_train[min_ix:max_ix]           Run train step         train_dict = {x_data: x_train_batch, y_output: y_train_ batch, dropout_keep_prob:0.5}  275           sess.run train_step, feed_dict=train_dict        Run loss and accuracy for training     temp_train_loss, temp_train_acc = sess.run [loss, accuracy],  feed_dict=train_dict      train_loss.append temp_train_loss      train_accuracy.append temp_train_acc        Run Eval Step     test_dict = {x_data: x_test, y_output: y_test, dropout_keep_ prob:1.0}     temp_test_loss, temp_test_acc = sess.run [loss, accuracy],  feed_dict=test_dict      test_loss.append temp_test_loss      test_accuracy.append temp_test_acc      print 'Epoch: {}, Test Loss: {:.2}, Test Acc: {:.2}'. format epoch+1, temp_test_loss, temp_test_acc    17.  This results in the following output:  Vocabulary Size: 933 80-20 Train Test split: 4459 -- 1115 Epoch: 1, Test Loss: 0.59, Test Acc: 0.83 Epoch: 2, Test Loss: 0.58, Test Acc: 0.83 Epoch: 19, Test Loss: 0.46, Test Acc: 0.86 Epoch: 20, Test Loss: 0.46, Test Acc: 0.86  18.  Here is the code to plot the train test loss and accuracy:  epoch_seq = np.arange 1, epochs+1  plt.plot epoch_seq, train_loss, 'k--', label='Train Set'  plt.plot epoch_seq, test_loss, 'r-', label='Test Set'  plt.title 'Softmax Loss'  plt.xlabel 'Epochs'  plt.ylabel 'Softmax Loss'  plt.legend loc='upper left'  plt.show    Plot accuracy over time plt.plot epoch_seq, train_accuracy, 'k--', label='Train Set'  plt.plot epoch_seq, test_accuracy, 'r-', label='Test Set'  plt.title 'Test Accuracy'  plt.xlabel 'Epochs'  plt.ylabel 'Accuracy'  plt.legend loc='upper left'  plt.show    276   How it works… In this recipe, we created an RNN to category model to predict if an SMS text is spam or ham. We achieved about 86% accuracy on the test set.Here are the plots of accuracy and loss on  both the test and training sets:  Figure 3: The accuracy  left  and loss  right  of the train and test sets.  There's more… It is highly recommended to go through the training dataset multiple times for sequential   data  and is also recommended for non-sequential data, too .Each pass through the data is  called an epoch.Also, it is very common and highly recommended to shuffle the data before  each epoch.  Implementing an LSTM Model We will extend our RNN model to be able to use longer sequences by introducing the LSTM  unit in this recipe.  Getting ready Long Short Term Memory LSTM  is a variant of the traditional RNN.LSTM is a way to address  the vanishing exploding gradient problem that variable length RNNs have.To address this  issue, LSTM cells introduce an internal forget gate,which can modify a flow of information  from one cell to the next. To conceptualize how this works, we will walk through an unbiased  version of LSTM one equation at a time.The first step is the same as for the regular RNN:  277   In order to figure out which values we want to forget or pass through, we will evaluate  candidate values as follows.These values are often referred to as the memory cells:  Now we modify the candidate memory cells by a forget matrix, which is calculated as follows:  We now combine the forget memory with the prior memory step and add it to the candidate  memory cells to arrive at the new memory values:  Now we combine everything to get the output of the cell:  Then, for the next iteration, we update h as follows:  The idea with LSTM is to have a self-regulating flow of information through the cells that can  be forgotten or modified based on the informationinput to the cell.  One great thing about using TensorFlow here is that we do not have to  keep track of these operations and their corresponding back propagation  attributes.TensorFlow will keep track of these and update the model  variables here automatically, according to the gradients specified by our  loss function, optimizer, and learning rates.  For this recipe, we will use a sequence RNN with LSTM cells to try to predict the next words,  trained on the works of Shakespeare.To test how we are doing, we will feed the model  candidate phrases, such as, thou art more, and see if the model can attempt to figure out  what words should follow the phrase.  278   How to do it…  1.  To start, we load the necessary libraries for the script:  import os import re import string import requests import numpy as np import collections import random import pickle import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import tensorflow as tf  2.  Next, we start a graph session and set the RNN parameterssess = tf.Session     Set RNN Parameters min_word_freq = 5 rnn_size = 128 epochs = 10 batch_size = 100 learning_rate = 0.001 training_seq_len = 50  embedding_size = rnn_size save_every = 500 eval_every = 50 prime_texts = ['thou art more', 'to be or not to', 'wherefore art  thou']  3.  We set up the data and model folders and filenames, along with declaring   punctuation to remove.We will want to keep hyphens and apostrophes because  Shakespeare uses them frequently to combine words and syllables: data_dir = 'temp' data_file = 'shakespeare.txt' model_path = 'shakespeare_model' full_model_dir = os.path.join data_dir, model_path   Declare punctuation to remove, everything except hyphens and  apostrophes punctuation = string.punctuation punctuation = ''.join [x for x in punctuation if x not in ['-',  "'"]]   279   4.  Next we get the data. If the data file doesn't exist, we download and save the   Shakespeare text. If it does exist, we load the data: if not os.path.exists full_model_dir :     os.makedirs full_model_dir   Make data directory if not os.path.exists data_dir :     os.makedirs data_dir  print 'Loading Shakespeare Data'   Check if file is downloaded. if not os.path.isfile os.path.join data_dir, data_file  :     print 'Not found, downloading Shakespeare texts from www. gutenberg.org'      shakespeare_url = 'http:  www.gutenberg.org cache epub 100  pg100.txt'      Get Shakespeare text     response = requests.get shakespeare_url      shakespeare_file = response.content      Decode binary into string     s_text = shakespeare_file.decode 'utf-8'       Drop first few descriptive paragraphs.     s_text = s_text[7675:]      Remove newlines     s_text = s_text.replace '\r\n', ''      s_text = s_text.replace '\n', ''        Write to file     with open os.path.join data_dir, data_file , 'w'  as out_conn:         out_conn.write s_text  else:      If file has been saved, load from that file     with open os.path.join data_dir, data_file , 'r'  as file_ conn:         s_text = file_conn.read  .replace '\n', ''   5.  We clean the Shakespeare text by removing punctuation and extra whitespace:  s_text = re.sub r'[{}]'.format punctuation , ' ', s_text  s_text = re.sub '\s+', ' ', s_text  .strip  .lower    6.  We now deal with creating the Shakespeare vocabulary to use.We create a function  that will return the two dictionaries  word to index, and index to word  with words that  appear more than a specified frequency: def build_vocab text, min_word_freq :     word_counts = collections.Counter text.split ' '    280        limit word counts to those more frequent than cutoff     word_counts = {key:val for key, val in word_counts.items   if  val>min_word_freq}      Create vocab --> index mapping     words = word_counts.keys       vocab_to_ix_dict = {key: ix+1  for ix, key in  enumerate words }      Add unknown key --> 0 index     vocab_to_ix_dict['unknown']=0      Create index --> vocab mapping     ix_to_vocab_dict = {val:key for key,val in vocab_to_ix_dict. items  }      return ix_to_vocab_dict, vocab_to_ix_dict  ix2vocab, vocab2ix = build_vocab s_text, min_word_freq  vocab_size = len ix2vocab  + 1  Note that when dealing with text, we have to be careful indexing  words with the value of zero. We should save the zero value for  padding, and potentially for unknown words as well.  7.  Now that we have our vocabulary, we turn the Shakespeare text into an array    of indices: s_text_words = s_text.split ' '  s_text_ix = [] for ix, x in enumerate s_text_words :     try:         s_text_ix.append vocab2ix[x]      except:         s_text_ix.append 0  s_text_ix = np.array s_text_ix   8.   In this recipe, we will show how to create a model in a class object.This will be helpful  for us, because we would like to use the same model  with the same weights  to train  on batches and to generate text from sample text.This will prove hard to do without  a class with an internal sampling method.Ideally, this class code should sit in a  separate Python file,which we can import at the beginning of this script: class LSTM_Model  :     def __init__ self, rnn_size, batch_size, learning_rate,                  training_seq_len, vocab_size, infer =False :         self.rnn_size = rnn_size         self.vocab_size = vocab_size         self.infer = infer  281           self.learning_rate = learning_rate          if infer:             self.batch_size = 1             self.training_seq_len = 1         else:             self.batch_size = batch_size             self.training_seq_len = training_seq_len          self.lstm_cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell rnn_size          self.initial_state = self.lstm_cell.zero_state self.batch_ size, tf.float32           self.x_data = tf.placeholder tf.int32, [self.batch_size,  self.training_seq_len]          self.y_output = tf.placeholder tf.int32, [self.batch_size,  self.training_seq_len]           with tf.variable_scope 'lstm_vars' :              Softmax Output Weights             W = tf.get_variable 'W', [self.rnn_size, self.vocab_ size], tf.float32, tf.random_normal_initializer                b = tf.get_variable 'b', [self.vocab_size],  tf.float32, tf.constant_initializer 0.0                 Define Embedding             embedding_mat = tf.get_variable 'embedding_mat',  [self.vocab_size, self.rnn_size], tf.float32, tf.random_normal_ initializer                 embedding_output = tf.nn.embedding_lookup embedding_ mat, self.x_data              rnn_inputs = tf.split 1, self.training_seq_len,  embedding_output              rnn_inputs_trimmed = [tf.squeeze x, [1]  for x in rnn_ inputs]           If we are inferring  generating text , we add a 'loop'  function          Define how to get the i+1 th input from the i th output         def inferred_loop prev, count :             prev_transformed = tf.matmul prev, W  + b             prev_symbol = tf.stop_gradient tf.argmax prev_ transformed, 1    282               output = tf.nn.embedding_lookup embedding_mat, prev_ symbol              return output           decoder = tf.nn.seq2seq.rnn_decoder         outputs, last_state = decoder rnn_inputs_trimmed,                                       self.initial_state,                                       self.lstm_cell,                                       loop_function=inferred_loop  if infer else None           Non inferred outputs         output = tf.reshape tf.concat 1, outputs , [-1, self.rnn_ size]           Logits and output         self.logit_output = tf.matmul output, W  + b         self.model_output = tf.nn.softmax self.logit_output           loss_fun = tf.nn.seq2seq.sequence_loss_by_example         loss = loss_fun [self.logit_output],[tf.reshape self.y_ output, [-1] ],                 [tf.ones [self.batch_size * self.training_seq_ len] ],                 self.vocab_size          self.cost = tf.reduce_sum loss     self.batch_size * self. training_seq_len          self.final_state = last_state         gradients, _ = tf.clip_by_global_norm tf.gradients self. cost, tf.trainable_variables   , 4.5          optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer self.learning_rate          self.train_op = optimizer.apply_gradients zip gradients,  tf.trainable_variables          def sample self, sess, words=ix2vocab, vocab=vocab2ix, num=10,  prime_text='thou art' :         state = sess.run self.lstm_cell.zero_state 1, tf.float32           word_list = prime_text.split           for word in word_list[:-1]:             x = np.zeros  1, 1               x[0, 0] = vocab[word]             feed_dict = {self.x_data: x, self.initial_state:state}             [state] = sess.run [self.final_state], feed_dict=feed_ dict          out_sentence = prime_text         word = word_list[-1]  283           for n in range num :             x = np.zeros  1, 1               x[0, 0] = vocab[word]             feed_dict = {self.x_data: x, self.initial_state:state}             [model_output, state] = sess.run [self.model_output,  self.final_state], feed_dict=feed_dict              sample = np.argmax model_output[0]              if sample == 0:                 break             word = words[sample]             out_sentence = out_sentence + ' ' + word         return out_sentence   9.  Now we will declare the LSTM model as well as the test model. We will do this   within a variable scope and tell the scope that we will reuse the variables for   the test LSTM model: with tf.variable_scope 'lstm_model'  as scope:      Define LSTM Model     lstm_model = LSTM_Model rnn_size, batch_size, learning_rate,                      training_seq_len, vocab_size      scope.reuse_variables       test_lstm_model = LSTM_Model rnn_size, batch_size, learning_ rate,                      training_seq_len, vocab_size, infer=True   10.  We create a saving operation, as well as splitting up the input text into equal batch-  size chunks.Then we will initialize the variables of the model: saver = tf.train.Saver    Create batches for each epoch num_batches = int len s_text_ix   batch_size * training_seq_len    + 1  Split up text indices into subarrays, of equal size batches = np.array_split s_text_ix, num_batches   Reshape each split into [batch_size, training_seq_len] batches = [np.resize x, [batch_size, training_seq_len]  for x in  batches]  Initialize all variables init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   11.  We can now iterate through our epochs, shuffling the data before each epoch   starts.The target for our data is just the same data, but shifted by one value  using  thenumpy.roll   function : train_loss = [] iteration_count = 1  284   for epoch in range epochs :      Shuffle word indices     random.shuffle batches       Create targets from shuffled batches     targets = [np.roll x, -1, axis=1  for x in batches]      Run a through one epoch     print 'Starting Epoch {} of {}.'.format epoch+1, epochs        Reset initial LSTM state every epoch     state = sess.run lstm_model.initial_state      for ix, batch in enumerate batches :         training_dict = {lstm_model.x_data: batch, lstm_model.y_ output: targets[ix]}         c, h = lstm_model.initial_state         training_dict[c] = state.c         training_dict[h] = state.h          temp_loss, state, _ = sess.run [lstm_model.cost, lstm_ model.final_state, lstm_model.train_op], feed_dict=training_dict          train_loss.append temp_loss            Print status every 10 gens         if iteration_count % 10 == 0:             summary_nums =  iteration_count, epoch+1, ix+1, num_ batches+1, temp_loss              print 'Iteration: {}, Epoch: {}, Batch: {} out of {},  Loss: {:.2f}'.format *summary_nums             Save the model and the vocab         if iteration_count % save_every == 0:              Save model             model_file_name = os.path.join full_model_dir,  'model'              saver.save sess, model_file_name, global_step =  iteration_count              print 'Model Saved To: {}'.format model_file_name                Save vocabulary             dictionary_file = os.path.join full_model_dir, 'vocab. pkl'              with open dictionary_file, 'wb'  as dict_file_conn:                 pickle.dump [vocab2ix, ix2vocab], dict_file_conn           if iteration_count % eval_every == 0:  285               for sample in prime_texts:                 print test_lstm_model.sample sess, ix2vocab,  vocab2ix, num=10, prime_text=sample            iteration_count += 1  12. This results in the following output:  Loading Shakespeare Data Cleaning Text Building Shakespeare Vocab Vocabulary Length = 8009 Starting Epoch 1 of 10. Iteration: 10, Epoch: 1, Batch: 10 out of 182, Loss: 10.37 Iteration: 20, Epoch: 1, Batch: 20 out of 182, Loss: 9.54 ...

And finally, here is how we plot the training loss over the epochs.  plt.plot train_loss, 'k-'  plt.title 'Sequence to Sequence Loss'  plt.xlabel 'Generation'  plt.ylabel 'Loss'  plt.show    Figure 4: The sequence-to-sequence loss over all generations of the model.  286   How it works… In this example, we built an RNN model with LSTM units to predict the next word, based on  Shakespearean vocabulary.There are a few things that could be done to improve the model,  maybe increasing the sequence size, having a decaying learning rate, or training the model for  more epochs.  There's more… For sampling, we implemented a greedy sampler.Greedy samplers can get stuck repeating the  same phrases over and over. For example, it may get stuck saying for the for the for the….To  prevent this, we could also implement a more random way of sampling words, maybe by doing  a weighted sampler based on the logits or probability distribution of the output.  Stacking multiple LSTM Layers Just like we can increase the depth of neural networks or CNNs, we can increase the depth of  RNN networks. In this recipe we apply a three layer deep LSTM to improve our Shakespeare  language generation.  Getting ready We can increase the depth of recurrent neural networks by stacking them on top of each  other. Essentially, we will be taking the target outputs and feeding them into another network. To get an idea of how this might work for just two layers, see the following figure:  Figure 5: In the preceding figures, we have extended the one-layer RNNs to have two layers. For the original one-layer   versions, see the figures in the prior chapter introduction.  287   TensorFlow allows easy implementation of multiple layers with a MultiRNNCell   function  that accepts a list of RNN cells.With this behavior, it is easy to create a multi-layer RNN from  one cell in Python with MultiRNNCell [rnn_cell]*num_layers .  For this recipe, we will perform the same Shakespeare prediction that we performed in the  previous recipe.There will be two changes:the first change will be having a three-stacked LSTM  model instead of only one layer.The second change will be doing character-level predictions  instead of words.Doing character-level predictions will greatly decrease our potential vocabulary  to only 40 characters  26 letters, 10 numbers, 1 whitespace, and 3 special characters .  How to do it… Instead of relisting all the same code, we will illustrate where our code in this section  will differ from the previous section.For the full code, please see the GitHub repository at  https:  github.com nfmcclure tensorflow_cookbook:  1.  We first need to set the number of layers for the model.We put this as a parameter at   the beginning of our script, with the other model parameters: num_layers = 3 min_word_freq = 5 rnn_size = 128 epochs = 10  2.  The first major change is that we will load, process, and feed the text by characters,   not by words. In order to accomplish this, after our cleaning of the text, we can  separate the whole text by characters with Python's list   command: s_text = re.sub r'[{}]'.format punctuation , ' ', s_text  s_text = re.sub '\s+', ' ', s_text  .strip  .lower    Split up by characters char_list = list s_text   3.  We now need to change our LSTM model to have multiple layers.We take in the  num_layers variable and create a multiple layer RNN model with TensorFlow's  MultiRNNCell   function, as shown here: class LSTM_Model  :     def __init__ self, rnn_size, num_layers, batch_size, learning_ rate,                  training_seq_len, vocab_size, infer_ sample=False :         self.rnn_size = rnn_size         self.num_layers = num_layers         self.vocab_size = vocab_size         self.infer_sample = infer_sample  288           self.learning_rate = learning_rate …          self.lstm_cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell rnn_size          self.lstm_cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.MultiRNNCell [self.lstm_ cell] * self.num_layers          self.initial_state = self.lstm_cell.zero_state self.batch_ size, tf.float32           self.x_data = tf.placeholder tf.int32, [self.batch_size,  self.training_seq_len]          self.y_output = tf.placeholder tf.int32, [self.batch_size,  self.training_seq_len]   Note that TensorFlow's MultiRNNCell   function accepts a  list of RNN cells.In this project, the RNN layers are all the same,  but you can make a list of whichever RNN layers you would like to  stack on top of each other.  4.  Everything else is essentially the same.Here we can see some of the training output:  Building Shakespeare Vocab by Characters Vocabulary Length = 40 Starting Epoch 1 of 10 Iteration: 9430, Epoch: 10, Batch: 889 out of 950, Loss: 1.54 Iteration: 9440, Epoch: 10, Batch: 899 out of 950, Loss: 1.46 Iteration: 9450, Epoch: 10, Batch: 909 out of 950, Loss: 1.49 thou art more than the  to be or not to the serva wherefore art thou dost thou Iteration: 9460, Epoch: 10, Batch: 919 out of 950, Loss: 1.41 Iteration: 9470, Epoch: 10, Batch: 929 out of 950, Loss: 1.45 Iteration: 9480, Epoch: 10, Batch: 939 out of 950, Loss: 1.59 Iteration: 9490, Epoch: 10, Batch: 949 out of 950, Loss: 1.42  5.  Here is a sample of the final text output:  thou art more fancy with to be or not to be for be wherefore art thou art thou  289   6.  Finally, here is how we plot the training loss over the generations:  plt.plot train_loss, 'k-'  plt.title 'Sequence to Sequence Loss'  plt.xlabel 'Generation'  plt.ylabel 'Loss'  plt.show    Figure 6: A plot of the training loss versus generations for the multiple-layer LSTM Shakespeare model.  How it works… TensorFlow makes it easy to extendan RNN layer to multiple layers with just a list of RNN cells. For this recipe, we used the same Shakespeare data as the previous recipe, but processed it  by characters instead of words.We fed this through a triple-layered LSTM model to generate  Shakespeare text.We can see that after only 10 epochs, we were able to generate archaic  English like words.  Creating Sequence-to-Sequence Models Since every RNN unit we use also has an output, we can train RNN sequences to predict other  sequences of variable length. For this recipe, we will take advantage of this fact to create an  English to German translation model.  290   Getting ready For this recipe, we will attempt to build a language translation model to translate from English  to German.  TensorFlow has a built-in model class for sequence-to-sequence training.We will illustrate   how to train and use it on downloaded English–German sentences.The data we will use  comes from a compiled ZIP file at http:  www.manythings.org , which compiles the  data from the Tatoeba Project  http:  tatoeba.org home .This data is a tab-delimited  English–German sentence translation. For example, a row might contain the sentence,   hello.  t hallo.The data contains thousands of sentences of various lengths.  How to do it…  1.  We start by loading the necessary libraries and starting a graph session:  import os import string import requests import io import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import tensorflow as tf from zipfile import ZipFile from collections import Counter from tensorflow.models.rnn.translate import seq2seq_model sess = tf.Session    2.  Now we set the model parameters.We set the learning rate to be 0.1.Here, we will  also decay the learning rate by 1% every 100 generations.This will help fine-tune  the model in later generations.We set a cut-off for the maximum gradient size  for the parameters as well.We use an RNN size of 500, and limit the English and  German vocabulary to be the most frequent 10,000 words.We will lowercase both  vocabularies and remove punctuation.We also normalize the German vocabulary by  changing the umlauts  ä,ë,ï,ö, and ü  and eszetts  ß  to be alpha-numeric: learning_rate = 0.1 lr_decay_rate = 0.99 lr_decay_every = 100 max_gradient = 5.0 batch_size = 50 num_layers = 3 rnn_size = 500 layer_size = 512 generations = 10000  291   vocab_size = 10000 save_every = 1000 eval_every = 500 output_every = 50 punct = string.punctuation data_dir = 'temp' data_file = 'eng_ger.txt' model_path = 'seq2seq_model' full_model_dir = os.path.join data_dir, model_path   3.  We now set up three English phrases to test the translation model and see how it is   performing: test_english = ['hello where is my computer',                 'the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog',                 'is it going to rain tomorrow']  4.  Next we create the model directories.We then check if the data has been   downloaded, and either download and save it or load it from the file: if not os.path.exists full_model_dir :     os.makedirs full_model_dir   Make data directory if not os.path.exists data_dir :     os.makedirs data_dir  print 'Loading English-German Data'   Check for data, if it doesn't exist, download it and save it if not os.path.isfile os.path.join data_dir, data_file  :     print 'Data not found, downloading Eng-Ger sentences from www. manythings.org'      sentence_url = 'http:  www.manythings.org anki deu-eng.zip'     r = requests.get sentence_url      z = ZipFile io.BytesIO r.content       file = z.read 'deu.txt'       Format Data     eng_ger_data = file.decode       eng_ger_data = eng_ger_data.encode 'ascii',errors='ignore'      eng_ger_data = eng_ger_data.decode  .split '\n'       Write to file     with open os.path.join data_dir, data_file , 'w'  as out_conn:         for sentence in eng_ger_data:             out_conn.write sentence + '\n'  else:     eng_ger_data = []     with open os.path.join data_dir, data_file , 'r'  as in_conn:         for row in in_conn:             eng_ger_data.append row[:-1]   292   5.  We process the data by removing the punctuation, splitting the English and German   sentences, and lowercasing all of them: eng_ger_data = [''.join char for char in sent if char not in  punct  for sent in eng_ger_data]  Split each sentence by tabs     eng_ger_data = [x.split '\t'  for x in eng_ger_data if len x >=1] [english_sentence, german_sentence] = [list x  for x in zip *eng_ ger_data ] english_sentence = [x.lower  .split   for x in english_sentence] german_sentence = [x.lower  .split   for x in german_sentence]  6.  Now we create the English and German vocabulary, picking the top 10,000 most   common words in each. The rest of the words will be labeled as 0, for unknown. This  is sometimes not a limiting factor, as most of the infrequent words are all proper  pronouns  names and places : all_english_words = [word for sentence in english_sentence for  word in sentence] all_english_counts = Counter all_english_words  eng_word_keys = [x[0] for x in all_english_counts.most_ common vocab_size-1 ] -1 because 0=unknown is also in there eng_vocab2ix = dict zip eng_word_keys, range 1,vocab_size    eng_ix2vocab = {val:key for key, val in eng_vocab2ix.items  } english_processed = [] for sent in english_sentence:     temp_sentence = []     for word in sent:         try:             temp_sentence.append eng_vocab2ix[word]          except:             temp_sentence.append 0      english_processed.append temp_sentence  all_german_words = [word for sentence in german_sentence for word  in sentence] all_german_counts = Counter all_german_words  ger_word_keys = [x[0] for x in all_german_counts.most_ common vocab_size-1 ] ger_vocab2ix = dict zip ger_word_keys, range 1,vocab_size    ger_ix2vocab = {val:key for key, val in ger_vocab2ix.items  } german_processed = [] for sent in german_sentence:     temp_sentence = []     for word in sent:         try:  293               temp_sentence.append ger_vocab2ix[word]          except:             temp_sentence.append 0      german_processed.append temp_sentence   7.  We also have to process the test vocabulary and change the test sentences we have   chosen to vocabulary indices: test_data = [] for sentence in test_english:     temp_sentence = []     for word in sentence.split ' ' :         try:             temp_sentence.append eng_vocab2ix[word]          except:              Use '0' if the word isn't in our vocabulary             temp_sentence.append 0      test_data.append temp_sentence   8.  Since some of the sentences are very short and some are very long, we will want to   create separate models for sentences that are different lengths. A reason to do this is  to minimize the effect the padding character has on shorter sentences. One way to do  this is to bucket the data into similar sized buckets. We have chosen the following cut- offs for the buckets in order to have a similar amount of sentences in each bucket: x_maxs = [5, 7, 11, 50] y_maxs = [10, 12, 17, 60] buckets = [x for x in zip x_maxs, y_maxs ] bucketed_data = [[] for _ in range len x_maxs  ] for eng, ger in zip english_processed, german_processed :     for ix,  x_max, y_max  in buckets:         if  len eng  <= x_max  and  len ger  <= y_max :             bucketed_data[ix].append [eng, ger]              break  9.  Now we use TensorFlow's built in sequence-to-sequence model with our parameters,   to create a function that will be used to create a trainable model and a testable  model that share the same variables: def translation_model sess, input_vocab_size, output_vocab_size,                       buckets, rnn_size, num_layers, max_gradient,                       learning_rate, lr_decay_rate, forward_only :     model = seq2seq_model.Seq2SeqModel            input_vocab_size,           output_vocab_size,           buckets,           rnn_size,           num_layers,           max_gradient,           batch_size,  294             learning_rate,           lr_decay_rate,           forward_only=forward_only,           dtype=tf.float32      return model   10.  We set a variable scope and create our trainable model, then tell TensorFlow to reuse  the variables in that scope, and create the test model, which will have a batch size of 1: input_vocab_size = vocab_size output_vocab_size = vocab_size with tf.variable_scope 'translate_model'  as scope:     translate_model = translation_model sess, vocab_size, vocab_ size,                                         buckets, rnn_size, num_ layers,                                         max_gradient, learning_ rate,                                         lr_decay_rate, False      Reuse the variables for the test model     scope.reuse_variables       test_model = translation_model sess, vocab_size, vocab_size,                                    buckets, rnn_size, num_layers,                                    max_gradient, learning_rate,                                    lr_decay_rate, True      test_model.batch_size = 1  11.  Next we initialize the variables in the model:  init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   12. Finally, we can train our sequence-to-sequence model by calling the step function for   every generation. TensorFlow's sequence-to-sequence model has a get_batch    function that will retrieve a batch of sentences from a given bucket index. We also  decay the learning rate, save the model, and evaluate on the test sentences when  appropriate: train_loss = [] for i in range generations :     rand_bucket_ix = np.random.choice len bucketed_data        model_outputs = translate_model.get_batch bucketed_data, rand_ bucket_ix      encoder_inputs, decoder_inputs, target_weights = model_outputs       Get the  gradient norm, loss, and outputs      _, step_loss, _ = translate_model.step sess, encoder_inputs,  decoder_inputs, target_weights, rand_bucket_ix, False        Output status  295       if  i+1  % output_every == 0:         train_loss.append step_loss          print 'Gen {} out of {}. Loss: {:.4}'.format i+1,  generations, step_loss         Check if we should decay the learning rate     if  i+1  % lr_decay_every == 0:         sess.run translate_model.learning_rate_decay_op        Save model     if  i+1  % save_every == 0:         print 'Saving model to {}.'.format full_model_dir           model_save_path = os.path.join full_model_dir, "eng_ger_ translation.ckpt"          translate_model.saver.save sess, model_save_path, global_ step=i        Eval on test set     if  i+1  % eval_every == 0:         for ix, sentence in enumerate test_data :              Find which bucket sentence goes in             bucket_id = next index for index, val in enumerate x_ maxs  if val>=len sentence                Get RNN model outputs             encoder_inputs, decoder_inputs, target_weights = test_ model.get_batch                  {bucket_id: [ sentence, [] ]}, bucket_id               Get logits             _, test_loss, output_logits = test_model.step sess,  encoder_inputs, decoder_inputs, target_weights, bucket_id, True              ix_output = [int np.argmax logit, axis=1   for logit  in output_logits]              If there is a 0 symbol in outputs end the output  there.             ix_output = ix_output[0:[ix for ix, x in enumerate ix_ output+[0]  if x==0][0]]              Get german words from indices             test_german = [ger_ix2vocab[x] for x in ix_output]             print 'English: {}'.format test_english[ix]               print 'German: {}'.format test_german    13.  This results in the following output:  Gen 0 out of 10000. Loss: 7.377 Gen 9800 out of 10000. Loss: 3.875 Gen 9850 out of 10000. Loss: 3.748 Gen 9900 out of 10000. Loss: 3.615 Gen 9950 out of 10000.

Here is the matplotlib code to plot the training loss that we saved on regular   intervals: loss_generations = [i for i in range generations  if i%output_ every==0] plt.plot loss_generations, train_loss, 'k-'  plt.title 'Sequence to Sequence Loss'  plt.xlabel 'Generation'  plt.ylabel 'Loss'  plt.show    Figure 7: Here, we plot the training loss over the course of 10,000 generations of    training the English–German sequence-to-sequence model.  How it works… For this recipe, we used TensorFlow's built in sequence-to-sequence model to translate from  English to German.  As we did not get perfect translations on our test sentences, there is room for improvement. If  we trained for longer, and potentially combined some buckets  for larger training data in each  bucket , we might be able to improve our translations.  297   There's more… There are other similar bilingual sentence datasets hosted on the manythings website   http:  www.manythings.org anki  .Feel free to substitute any language dataset that  appeals to you.  Training a Siamese Similarity Measure A great property of RNN models, as compared to many other models, is that they can deal  with sequences of various lengths. Taking advantage of this fact and that they can generalize  to sequences not seen before, we can create a way to measure how similar sequences of  inputs are to each other. In this recipe, we will train a Siamese similarity RNN to measure the  similarity between addresses for record matching.  Getting ready In this recipe, we will build a bidirectional RNN model that feeds into a fully connected layer  that outputs a fixed length numerical vector. We create a bidirectional RNN layer for both  input addresses and feed the outputs into a fully connected layer that outputs a fixed length  numerical vector  length 100 . We then compare the two vector outputs with the cosine  distance, which is bounded between -1 and 1. We denote input data to be similar with a target  of 1, and different with a target of -1. The predictions of the cosine distance is just the sign  of the output  negative means dissimilar, positive means similar . We can use this network  to do record matching by taking the reference address that scores the highest on the cosine  distance from the query address.  See the following network architecture diagram:  Figure 8: Siamese RNN similarity model architecture.  What is also great about this model, is that it accepts inputs that it has not seen before and  can compare them with an output of -1 to 1. We will show this in the code by picking a test  address that the model has not seen before and see if it can match it to a similar address.  298   How to do it…  1.  We start by loading the necessary libraries and starting a graph session:  import os import random import string import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import tensorflow as tf sess = tf.Session    2.  We now set the model parameters as follows:  batch_size = 200 n_batches = 300 max_address_len = 20 margin = 0.25 num_features = 50 dropout_keep_prob = 0.8  3.  Next, we create the Siamese RNN similarity model class as follows:  def snn address1, address2, dropout_keep_prob,         vocab_size, num_features, input_length :       Define the siamese double RNN with a fully connected layer  at the end     def siamese_nn input_vector, num_hidden :         cell_unit = tf.nn.rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell           Forward direction cell         lstm_forward_cell = cell_unit num_hidden, forget_bias=1.0          lstm_forward_cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.DropoutWrapper lstm_ forward_cell, output_keep_prob=dropout_keep_prob            Backward direction cell         lstm_backward_cell = cell_unit num_hidden, forget_ bias=1.0          lstm_backward_cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.DropoutWrapper lstm_ backward_cell, output_keep_prob=dropout_keep_prob            Split title into a character sequence         input_embed_split = tf.split 1, input_length, input_ vector   299           input_embed_split = [tf.squeeze x, squeeze_dims=[1]  for x  in input_embed_split]           Create bidirectional layer         outputs, _, _ = tf.nn.bidirectional_rnn lstm_forward_cell,                                                 lstm_backward_ cell,                                                 input_embed_split,                                                 dtype=tf.float32           Average The output over the sequence         temporal_mean = tf.add_n outputs    input_length           Fully connected layer         output_size = 10         A = tf.get_variable name="A", shape=[2*num_hidden, output_ size],                             dtype=tf.float32,                             initializer=tf.random_normal_ initializer stddev=0.1           b = tf.get_variable name="b", shape=[output_size],  dtype=tf.float32,                             initializer=tf.random_normal_ initializer stddev=0.1            final_output = tf.matmul temporal_mean, A  + b         final_output = tf.nn.dropout final_output, dropout_keep_ prob           return final_output       with tf.variable_scope "siamese"  as scope:             output1 = siamese_nn address1, num_features               Declare that we will use the same variables on the  second string             scope.reuse_variables               output2 = siamese_nn address2, num_features        Unit normalize the outputs     output1 = tf.nn.l2_normalize output1, 1      output2 = tf.nn.l2_normalize output2, 1       Return cosine distance        in this case, the dot product of the norms is the same.     dot_prod = tf.reduce_sum tf.mul output1, output2 , 1       return dot_prod   300   Note the usage of a variable scope to share parameters between  the two parts of the Siamese network for the two address inputs.  Also note that the cosine distance is achieved by the dot product  of the normalized vectors.  4.  Now we will declare our prediction function, which is just the sign of the cosine   distance as follows: def get_predictions scores :     predictions = tf.sign scores, name="predictions"      return predictions   5.  Now we will declare our loss function as described before. Remember that we want  to leave a margin  similar to a SVM model  for error. We will also have a loss term for  true positives and true negatives. Use the following code for the loss: def loss scores, y_target, margin :      Calculate the positive losses     pos_loss_term = 0.25 * tf.square tf.sub 1., scores       pos_mult = tf.cast y_target, tf.float32        Make sure positive losses are on similar strings     positive_loss = tf.mul pos_mult, pos_loss_term        Calculate negative losses, then make sure on dissimilar  strings     neg_mult = tf.sub 1., tf.cast y_target, tf.float32        negative_loss = neg_mult*tf.square scores        Combine similar and dissimilar losses     loss = tf.add positive_loss, negative_loss        Create the margin term.  This is when the targets are 0.,  and the scores are less than m, return 0.       Check if target is zero  dissimilar strings      target_zero = tf.equal tf.cast y_target, tf.float32 , 0.       Check if cosine outputs is smaller than margin     less_than_margin = tf.less scores, margin       Check if both are true     both_logical = tf.logical_and target_zero, less_than_margin      both_logical = tf.cast both_logical, tf.float32       If both are true, then multiply by  1-1 =0.  301       multiplicative_factor = tf.cast 1. - both_logical, tf.float32      total_loss = tf.mul loss, multiplicative_factor        Average loss over batch     avg_loss = tf.reduce_mean total_loss      return avg_loss   6.  We declare an accuracy function as follows:  def accuracy scores, y_target :     predictions = get_predictions scores      correct_predictions = tf.equal predictions, y_target      accuracy = tf.reduce_mean tf.cast correct_predictions,  tf.float32       return accuracy   7.  We will create similar addresses by creating a typo in an address. We will denote   these addresses  reference address and typo address  as similar: def create_typo s :     rand_ind = random.choice range len s        s_list = list s      s_list[rand_ind]=random.choice string.ascii_lowercase +  '0123456789'      s = ''.join s_list      return s   8.  The data that we will generate will be random combinations of street numbers, street   names, and street suffixes. The names and suffixes are from the following lists: street_names = ['abbey', 'baker', 'canal', 'donner', 'elm',  'fifth', 'grandvia', 'hollywood', 'interstate', 'jay', 'kings'] street_types = ['rd', 'st', 'ln', 'pass', 'ave', 'hwy', 'cir',  'dr', 'jct']  9.  We generate test queries and references as follows:  test_queries = ['111 abbey ln', '271 doner cicle',                 '314 king avenue', 'tensorflow is fun'] test_references = ['123 abbey ln', '217 donner cir', '314 kings  ave', '404 hollywood st', 'tensorflow is so fun']  Note the last query and reference are not any addresses that the  model will have seen before, but we hope that they will be what the  model sees as most similar at the end.  302   10.  We will now define how to generate a batch of data.  Our batch of data will be   half similar addresses  reference address and a typo address  and half dissimilar  addresses. We generate the dissimilar addresses by taking half of the address list  and shifting the targets by one position  with the function numpy.roll   : def get_batch n :      Generate a list of reference addresses with similar  addresses that have      a typo.     numbers = [random.randint 1, 9999  for i in range n ]     streets = [random.choice street_names  for i in range n ]     street_suffs = [random.choice street_types  for i in range n ]     full_streets = [str w  + ' ' + x + ' ' + y for w,x,y in  zip numbers, streets, street_suffs ]     typo_streets = [create_typo x  for x in full_streets]     reference = [list x  for x in zip full_streets, typo_streets ]       Shuffle last half of them for training on dissimilar  addresses     half_ix = int n 2      bottom_half = reference[half_ix:]     true_address = [x[0] for x in bottom_half]     typo_address = [x[1] for x in bottom_half]     typo_address = list np.roll typo_address, 1       bottom_half = [[x,y] for x,y in zip true_address, typo_ address ]     reference[half_ix:] = bottom_half       Get target similarities  1's for similar, -1's for non- similar      target = [1]* n-half_ix  + [-1]*half_ix     reference = [[x,y] for x,y in zip reference, target ]     return reference   11.  Next, we will define our address vocabulary and how to one-hot-encode the addresses   to indices: vocab_chars = string.ascii_lowercase + '0123456789 ' vocab2ix_dict = {char: ix+1  for ix, char in enumerate vocab_ chars } vocab_length = len vocab_chars  + 1   Define vocab one-hot encoding def address2onehot address,                    vocab2ix_dict = vocab2ix_dict,  303                      max_address_len = max_address_len :      translate address string into indices     address_ix = [vocab2ix_dict[x] for x in list address ]       Pad or crop to max_address_len     address_ix =  address_ix + [0]*max_address_len [0:max_address_ len]     return address_ix   12. After dealing with the vocabulary, we will start declaring our model placeholders and  the embedding lookup. For the embedding lookup, we will be using one-hot-encoded  embedding by using an identity matrix as the lookup matrix. Use the following code: address1_ph = tf.placeholder tf.int32, [None, max_address_len],  name="address1_ph"  address2_ph = tf.placeholder tf.int32, [None, max_address_len],  name="address2_ph"  y_target_ph = tf.placeholder tf.int32, [None], name="y_target_ph"  dropout_keep_prob_ph = tf.placeholder tf.float32, name="dropout_ keep_prob"    Create embedding lookup identity_mat = tf.diag tf.ones shape=[vocab_length]   address1_embed = tf.nn.embedding_lookup identity_mat, address1_ph  address2_embed = tf.nn.embedding_lookup identity_mat, address2_ph   13.  We will now declare the model, accuracy, loss, and prediction operations as follows:   Define Model text_snn = model.snn address1_embed, address2_embed, dropout_keep_ prob_ph,                      vocab_length, num_features, max_address_len   Define Accuracy batch_accuracy = model.accuracy text_snn, y_target_ph   Define Loss batch_loss = model.loss text_snn, y_target_ph, margin   Define Predictions predictions = model.get_predictions text_snn   14.  Finally, before we can start training, we add the optimization and initialization   operations to the graph as follows:  Declare optimizer optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer 0.01   Apply gradients train_op = optimizer.minimize batch_loss   304    Initialize Variables init = tf.global_variables_initializer   sess.run init   15.  We will now iterate through the training generations and keep track of the loss and   accuracy: train_loss_vec = [] train_acc_vec = [] for b in range n_batches :      Get a batch of data     batch_data = get_batch batch_size       Shuffle data     np.random.shuffle batch_data       Parse addresses and targets     input_addresses = [x[0] for x in batch_data]     target_similarity = np.array [x[1] for x in batch_data]      address1 = np.array [address2onehot x[0]  for x in input_ addresses]      address2 = np.array [address2onehot x[1]  for x in input_ addresses]       train_feed_dict = {address1_ph: address1,                        address2_ph: address2,                        y_target_ph: target_similarity,                        dropout_keep_prob_ph: dropout_keep_prob}      _, train_loss, train_acc = sess.run [train_op, batch_loss,  batch_accuracy],                                         feed_dict=train_feed_dict       Save train loss and accuracy     train_loss_vec.append train_loss      train_acc_vec.append train_acc   16.  After training, we now process the testing queries and references to see how the   model can perform: test_queries_ix = np.array [address2onehot x  for x in test_ queries]  test_references_ix = np.array [address2onehot x  for x in test_ references]  num_refs = test_references_ix.shape[0] best_fit_refs = [] for query in test_queries_ix:     test_query = np.repeat np.array [query] , num_refs, axis=0      test_feed_dict = {address1_ph: test_query,  305                         address2_ph: test_references_ix,                       y_target_ph: target_similarity,                       dropout_keep_prob_ph: 1.0}     test_out = sess.run text_snn, feed_dict=test_feed_dict      best_fit = test_references[np.argmax test_out ]     best_fit_refs.append best_fit  print 'Query Addresses: {}'.format test_queries   print 'Model Found Matches: {}'.format best_fit_refs    17.  This results in the following output:  Query Addresses: ['111 abbey ln', '271 doner cicle', '314 king  avenue', 'tensorflow is fun'] Model Found Matches:['123 abbey ln', '217 donner cir', '314 kings  ave', 'tensorflow is so fun']  There's more… We can see from the test queries and references, that the model not only was able to identify  the correct reference addresses, it was also able to generalize to a non-address phrase. We  can also see how the model performed by looking at the loss and accuracy during training:  Figure 9: The accuracy and loss for the Siamese RNN similarity model during training.  306   Notice that we did not have a designated test set for this exercise. The reason is because of  how we generated the data. We created a batch function that creates new batch data every  time it is called so the model is always seeing new data.  Because of this, we can use the  batch loss and accuracy as proxies to the test loss and accuracies. But this is never true with  a finite set of real data, as we would always have to have a train and test set to judge the  performance of the model.  307    10  Taking TensorFlow to  Production  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:   f Implementing Unit Tests  f Using Multiple Executors  f Parallelizing TensorFlow  f Taking TensorFlow to Production  f Productionalizing TensorFlow – An Example  Introduction Up to this point, we have covered how to train and evaluate various models in TensorFlow.  In this chapter, we will show how to write code that is ready for production usage. There are  various definitions of production-ready code but, for us, production code will be defined as  code that has unit tests, separates the training and evaluation code, and efficiently saves and  loads various needed parts of the data pipeline and created graph session.  The Python scripts provided in this chapter should be run from the  command line. This allows tests to be run, and device placements  to be logged to the screen.  309   Implementing unit tests Testing code results in faster prototyping, more efficient debugging, faster changing, and  makes it easier to share code. There are easy ways to implement unit tests in TensorFlow   that we will cover in this recipe.  Getting ready When programming a TensorFlow model, it will help to have unit tests to check the  functionality of the program. This helps us because, when we want to make changes to a  program unit, tests will make sure that those changes do not break the model in unknown  ways. In this recipe, we will create a simple CNN network that relies on the MNIST data.  With it, we will implement three different types of unit test to illustrate how to write them in  TensorFlow.  Note that Python has a great testing library called Nose. TensorFlow  also has built-in testing functions, and we will illustrate how these  make it easier to test the value of tensor objects without having to  evaluate the values in a session.  1.  We start by loading the necessary libraries and formatting the data:  import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow.contrib.learn.python.learn.datasets.mnist import  read_data_sets from tensorflow.python.framework import ops ops.reset_default_graph    Start a graph session sess = tf.Session    Load data data_dir = 'temp' mnist = read_data_sets data_dir   Convert images into 28x28  they are downloaded as 1x784  train_xdata = np.array [np.reshape x,  28,28   for x in mnist. train.images]  test_xdata = np.array [np.reshape x,  28,28   for x in mnist.test. images]   Convert labels into one-hot encoded vectors train_labels = mnist.train.labels test_labels = mnist.test.labels  Set model parameters batch_size = 100  310   learning_rate = 0.005 evaluation_size = 100 image_width = train_xdata[0].shape[0] image_height = train_xdata[0].shape[1] target_size = max train_labels  + 1 num_channels = 1  greyscale = 1 channel generations = 100 eval_every = 5 conv1_features = 25 conv2_features = 50 max_pool_size1 = 2  NxN window for 1st max pool layer max_pool_size2 = 2  NxN window for 2nd max pool layer fully_connected_size1 = 100 dropout_prob = 0.75  2.  We then declare our placeholders, variables, and model formulation:   Declare model placeholders x_input_shape =  batch_size, image_width, image_height, num_ channels  x_input = tf.placeholder tf.float32, shape=x_input_shape  y_target = tf.placeholder tf.int32, shape= batch_size   eval_input_shape =  evaluation_size, image_width, image_height,  num_channels  eval_input = tf.placeholder tf.float32, shape=eval_input_shape  eval_target = tf.placeholder tf.int32, shape= evaluation_size   dropout = tf.placeholder tf.float32, shape=     Declare model parameters conv1_weight = tf.Variable tf.truncated_normal [4, 4, num_ channels, conv1_features],                                                stddev=0.1,  dtype=tf.float32   conv1_bias = tf.Variable tf.zeros [conv1_features], dtype=tf. float32   conv2_weight = tf.Variable tf.truncated_normal [4, 4, conv1_ features, conv2_features],                                                stddev=0.1,  dtype=tf.float32   conv2_bias = tf.Variable tf.zeros [conv2_features], dtype=tf. float32    fully connected variables resulting_width = image_width     max_pool_size1 * max_pool_size2  resulting_height = image_height     max_pool_size1 * max_pool_ size2   311   full1_input_size = resulting_width * resulting_height * conv2_ features full1_weight = tf.Variable tf.truncated_normal [full1_input_size,  fully_connected_size1],                           stddev=0.1, dtype=tf.float32   full1_bias = tf.Variable tf.truncated_normal [fully_connected_ size1], stddev=0.1, dtype=tf.float32   full2_weight = tf.Variable tf.truncated_normal [fully_connected_ size1, target_size],                                                stddev=0.1,  dtype=tf.float32   full2_bias = tf.Variable tf.truncated_normal [target_size],  stddev=0.1, dtype=tf.float32    Initialize Model Operations def my_conv_net input_data :      First Conv-ReLU-MaxPool Layer     conv1 = tf.nn.conv2d input_data, conv1_weight, strides=[1, 1,  1, 1], padding='SAME'      relu1 = tf.nn.relu tf.nn.bias_add conv1, conv1_bias       max_pool1 = tf.nn.max_pool relu1, ksize=[1, max_pool_size1,  max_pool_size1, 1],                                strides=[1, max_pool_size1, max_ pool_size1, 1], padding='SAME'       Second Conv-ReLU-MaxPool Layer     conv2 = tf.nn.conv2d max_pool1, conv2_weight, strides=[1, 1,  1, 1], padding='SAME'      relu2 = tf.nn.relu tf.nn.bias_add conv2, conv2_bias       max_pool2 = tf.nn.max_pool relu2, ksize=[1, max_pool_size2,  max_pool_size2, 1],                                strides=[1, max_pool_size2, max_ pool_size2, 1], padding='SAME'       Transform Output into a 1xN layer for next fully connected  layer     final_conv_shape = max_pool2.get_shape  .as_list       final_shape = final_conv_shape[1] * final_conv_shape[2] *  final_conv_shape[3]     flat_output = tf.reshape max_pool2, [final_conv_shape[0],  final_shape]       First Fully Connected Layer     fully_connected1 = tf.nn.relu tf.add tf.matmul flat_output,  full1_weight , full1_bias        Second Fully Connected Layer     final_model_output = tf.add tf.matmul fully_connected1, full2_ weight , full2_bias        Add dropout  312       final_model_output = tf.nn.dropout final_model_output,  dropout       return final_model_output  model_output = my_conv_net x_input  test_model_output = my_conv_net eval_input   3.  Next we create our loss function, prediction, and accuracy operations. Then we   initialize the model variables:  Declare Loss Function  softmax cross entropy  loss = tf.reduce_mean tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_ logits model_output, y_target    Create a prediction function prediction = tf.nn.softmax model_output  test_prediction = tf.nn.softmax test_model_output   Create accuracy function def get_accuracy logits, targets :     batch_predictions = np.argmax logits, axis=1      num_correct = np.sum np.equal batch_predictions, targets       return 100. * num_correct batch_predictions.shape[0]   Create an optimizer my_optimizer = tf.train.MomentumOptimizer learning_rate, 0.9  train_step = my_optimizer.minimize loss   Initialize Variables init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   4.  For our first unit test, we use the tf.test.TestCase class and create a way to   test the values of a placeholder  or variable . For this test case, we make sure that  the dropout probability  for keeping  is greater than 0.25, so that the model is not  changed to attempt to train on more than 75% dropout:  Check values of tensors! class drop_out_test tf.test.TestCase :      Make sure that we don't drop too much     def dropout_greaterthan self :         with self.test_session  :           self.assertGreater dropout.eval  , 0.25   5.  Next, we will test that our accuracy function is behaving properly. We will create  a sample array of probabilities and what we expect, and make sure that the test  accuracy returns 100%:  Test accuracy function class accuracy_test tf.test.TestCase :      Make sure accuracy function behaves correctly  313       def accuracy_exact_test self :         with self.test_session  :             test_preds = [[0.9, 0.1],[0.01, 0.99]]             test_targets = [0, 1]             test_acc = get_accuracy test_preds, test_targets              self.assertEqual test_acc.eval  , 100.   6.  We can also make sure that a tensor is the shape that we expect. Next, we test that   the model output is the expected shape of batch_size by target_size:  Test tensorshape class shape_test tf.test.TestCase :      Make sure our model output is size [batch_size, num_classes]     def output_shape_test self :         with self.test_session  :             numpy_array = np.ones [batch_size, target_size]              self.assertShapeEqual numpy_array, model_output   7.  To perform these tests, we just put in the following command, followed by our training   loop  or the rest of our program :  Perform unit tests tf.test.main    Start training loop for i in range generations :     ...  8.   If we run the program on the command line, we get the following output: $python3 implementing_unit_tests.py Ran 3 tests in 0.000s OK  9.  The full program can be found on the book's GitHub repository at https:  github.  com nfmcclure tensorflow_cookbook .  How it works… We implemented three types of unit tests, tensor values, operations outputs, and tensor  shapes. There are more types of unit test functions for TensorFlow, and they can be found  here: https:  www.tensorflow.org versions master api_docs python test. html.  Remember that a unit test helps us assure that code will function as expected, provide  confidence in sharing code, and make reproducibility more accessible.  314   Using Multiple Executors It should be apparent to the reader that there are many features of TensorFlow and  computational graphs that lend itself naturally to being computed in parallel. The computational  graph can be broken up on different processors as well as processing different batches. We will  address how to access different processors on the same machine in this recipe.  Getting ready For this recipe, we will show how to access multiple devices on the same system and train on  them. This is a very common occurrence, as along with a CPU, a machine may have one or  more GPUs that can share the computational load. If TensorFlow can access these devices,  it will automatically distribute the computations to the multiple devices via a greedy process.  But TensorFlow also allows the program to specify which operations will be on which devices  via namescope placement.  In order to access GPU devices, the GPU version of TensorFlow must be installed. To install the  GPU version of TensorFlow, visit https:  www.tensorflow.org versions master  get_started os_setup.htmldownload-and-setup and follow the instructions for your  specific system. Be aware that the GPU versions of TensorFlow require CUDA to use the GPU.  In this recipe, we will show you a range of commands that will allow you to access the various  devices on your system, and find out which devices TensorFlow is using.  How to do it…  1.   In order to find out what devices TensorFlow is using for which operations, we can  set a config in the Session parameters that sets log_device_placement to  True. When we run the script from the command line, we will see specific device  placements as the output: import tensorflow as tf sess = tf.Session config=tf.ConfigProto log_device_ placement=True   a = tf.constant [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[2, 3],  name='a'  b = tf.constant [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[3, 2],  name='b'  c = tf.matmul a, b   Runs the op. print sess.run c    315   2.  From the terminal, run the following command:  $python3 using_multiple_devices.py Device mapping: no known devices. I tensorflow core common_runtime direct_session.cc:175] Device  mapping: MatMul:  job:localhost replica:0 task:0 cpu:0 I tensorflow core common_runtime simple_placer.cc:818] MatMul:   job:localhost replica:0 task:0 cpu:0 b:  job:localhost replica:0 task:0 cpu:0 I tensorflow core common_runtime simple_placer.cc:818] b:   job:localhost replica:0 task:0 cpu:0 a:  job:localhost replica:0 task:0 cpu:0 I tensorflow core common_runtime simple_placer.cc:818] a:   job:localhost replica:0 task:0 cpu:0 [[ 22.  28.]  [ 49.  64.]]  3.  Sometimes, we would like to make sure TensorFlow is deciding the placements. This  is useful when loading a prior saved model that had hard placements assigned in the  graph and our machine has different devices to those the graph would have. We can  set soft placements in the configuration as follows: config = tf.ConfigProto   config.allow_soft_placement = True sess_soft = tf.Session config=config   4.  When using GPUs, TensorFlow automatically takes up a large portion of the GPU   memory. While this is usually desired, we can take steps to be more careful with the  GPU memory allocation. While TensorFlow never releases GPU memory, we can slowly  grow GPU memory allocation to the maximum limit  only when needed  by setting a  GPU memory growth option as follows: config.gpu_options.allow_growth = True sess_grow = tf.Session config=config   5.   If we want to put a hard limit on the percentage of GPU memory used by TensorFlow,  we can use the config setting per_process_gpu_memory_fraction: config.gpu_options.per_process_gpu_memory_fraction = 0.4 sess_limited = tf.Session config=config   6.  Sometimes, we would like to write robust code that can determine if it is running  with the GPU available or not. TensorFlow has a built-in function that can test this.  This is helpful if we want to write code that can take advantage of the GPU when it is  available and assign specific operations to it: if tf.test.is_built_with_cuda  :  316   7.  We may wish to assign specific operations, say to the GPU. Here is an example of   code that does some simple calculations and assigns them to the main CPU, and the  two auxiliary GPUs: with tf.device ' cpu:0' : a = tf.constant [1.0, 3.0, 5.0], shape=[1, 3]      b = tf.constant [2.0, 4.0, 6.0], shape=[3, 1]       with tf.device ' gpu:0' :         c = tf.matmul a,b          c = tf.reshape c, [-1]       with tf.device ' gpu:1' :         d = tf.matmul b,a          flat_d = tf.reshape d, [-1]       combined = tf.mul c, flat_d  print sess.run combined    How it works… When we want to specify particular devices on our machine for TensorFlow operations, we will  need to know how TensorFlow refers to such devices.  Device names in TensorFlow follow the  following conventions:  Device Main CPU Second CPU Main GPU Second GPU Third GPU  Device name  cpu:0  cpu:1  gpu:0  gpu:1  gpu:2  There's more… Running TensorFlow in the cloud is getting easier and easier. Many cloud computation service  providers offer GPU instances that have a main CPU and a powerful GPU alongside it. Amazon  Web Services  AWS  has G instances and P2 instances that allow usage of powerful GPUs  that offer great speedup for TensorFlow processes. There are even AWS Machine Images   AMIs  that you can select for free that will boot up a selected instance with the GPU instance  of TensorFlow installed.  317   Parallelizing TensorFlow To extend our reach for parallelizing TensorFlow, we can also perform separate operations of  our graph on entirely different machines in a distributed manner. This recipe will show us how  that is achieved.  Getting ready A few months after the release of TensorFlow, Google released TensorFlow Distributed.  This was a big upgrade to the TensorFlow ecosystem, allowing a TensorFlow cluster to be set  up  separate worker machines , to share the computational task of training and evaluating  models. Using TensorFlow Distributed is as easy as setting up some parameters for workers  and then assigning different jobs to different workers.  In this recipe, we will set up two local workers and assign them different jobs.  How to do it…  1.  To start, we load TensorFlow and define our two local workers with a configuration   dictionary file  ports 2222 and 2223 : import tensorflow as tf  Cluster for 2 local workers  tasks 0 and 1 : cluster = tf.train.ClusterSpec {'local': ['localhost:2222',  'localhost:2223']}   2.  Now we join the two workers into the server and label them with task numbers:  server = tf.train.Server cluster, job_name="local", task_index=0  server = tf.train.Server cluster, job_name="local", task_index=1   3.  Now we will have each worker do a task. The first worker will initialize two matrices   each 25 by 25 . The second worker will sum all the elements. Then we auto assign  the sum of the two sums and print the output: mat_dim = 25 matrix_list = {} with tf.device ' job:local task:0' :     for i in range 0, 2 :         m_label = 'm_{}'.format i          matrix_list[m_label] = tf.random_normal [mat_dim, mat_ dim]   Have each worker calculate the sums sum_outs = {} with tf.device ' job:local task:1' :  318       for i in range 0, 2 :         A = matrix_list['m_{}'.format i ]         sum_outs['m_{}'.format i ] = tf.reduce_sum A       Sum all the sums     summed_out = tf.add_n list sum_outs.values     with tf.Session server.target  as sess:     result = sess.run summed_out      print 'Summed Values:{}'.format result    4.  Now we can run the following at the command prompt:  $ python3 parallelizing_tensorflow.py I tensorflow core distributed_runtime rpc grpc_channel.cc:197]  Initialize GrpcChannelCache for job local -> {0 -> localhost:2222,  1 -> localhost:2223} I tensorflow core distributed_runtime rpc grpc_server_lib.cc:206]  Started server with target: grpc:  localhost:2222 I tensorflow core distributed_runtime rpc grpc_channel.cc:197]  Initialize GrpcChannelCache for job local -> {0 -> localhost:2222,  1 -> localhost:2223} I tensorflow core distributed_runtime rpc grpc_server_lib.cc:206]  Started server with target: grpc:  localhost:2223 I tensorflow core distributed_runtime master_session.cc:928] Start  master session 252bb6f530553002 with config:  Summed Values:-21.12611198425293  How it works… Using TensorFlow Distributed is quite easy. We just have to assign the worker IPs to the server  with names. Then we can manually assign or auto assign operations to the workers.  Taking TensorFlow to Production If we want to use our machine learning scripts in a production setting, there are some points  to consider for best practices. Here, we will help to point out some best practices.  Getting ready In this recipe, we want to summarize and condense various tips for bringing TensorFlow to  production. We will cover how to best save and load vocabularies, graphs, variables, and  model checkpoints. We will also talk about how to use TensorFlow's command-line argument  parser and change the logging verbosity of TensorFlow.  319   How to do it…  1.  When running a TensorFlow program, we may want to be sure that no other graph  session is already in memory, or that we clear the graph session every time while  debugging a program. We can accomplish this as follows: from tensorflow.python.framework import ops ops.reset_default_graph    2.  When dealing with text  or any data pipeline , we need to be sure that we save how  we process the data, so that we can process future evaluation data the same way.  If we are dealing with text, we need to be sure we can save and load the vocabulary  dictionary. See the following code for an example of saving the vocabulary dictionary  with the JSON library: import json word_list = ['to', 'be', 'or', 'not', 'to', 'be'] vocab_list = list set word_list   vocab2ix_dict = dict zip vocab_list, range len vocab_list     ix2vocab_dict = {val:key for key,val in vocab2ix_dict.items  }  Save vocabulary import json with open 'vocab2ix_dict.json', 'w'  as file_conn:     json.dump vocab2ix_dict, file_conn   Load vocabulary with open 'vocab2ix_dict.json', 'r'  as file_conn:     vocab2ix_dict = json.load file_conn   We saved the vocabulary dictionary here in a JSON format. We can also  save it in a text file, CSV, or even a binary format. If the vocabulary is  large, a binary file is preferred. Look into using the pickle library to create  a pkl binary file. Be aware though that pickle files do not translate well  between library and Python versions.  3.  To save the model graph and variables, we create a Saver   operation and add that   to the graph. It is recommended that the model is saved on a regular basis during  training. See the following example code for saving the model regularly:  After model declaration, add a saving operations saver = tf.train.Saver    Then during training, save every so often, referencing the  training generation for i in range generations :     ...     if i%save_every == 0:  320           saver.save sess, 'my_model', global_step=step   Can also save only specific variables: saver = tf.train.Saver {"my_var": my_variable}   Note that the Saver   operation also takes other parameters. As  shown previously, it can take a dictionary of variables and tensors to  save specific elements. It also can take checkpoint_every_n_ hours, which performs the saving operation on a regular time basis,  instead of a generation basis. By default, the saving operation only  keeps the last five model saves  for space considerations . This can  be changed with the max_to_keep option  default is 5 .  4.  Before saving a model, be sure to name important operations of the model.   TensorFlow does not have an easy way to load specific placeholders, operations, or  variables if they do not have a name. Most operations and functions in TensorFlow  accept a name argument: conv_weights = tf.Variable tf.random_normal  , name='conv_ weights'  loss = tf.reduce_mean ... , name='loss'   5.  TensorFlow also makes it easy to perform arg-parsing on the command line with  the tf.apps.flags library. With these functions, we can define command-line  arguments that are strings, floats, integers, or Booleans as shown here. With these  flag definitions, we can just run tf.app.run   and this will run the main   function  with these flag arguments: tf.app.flags.DEFINE_string "worker_locations", "", "List of worker  addresses."  tf.app.flags.DEFINE_float 'learning_rate', 0.01, 'Initial learning  rate.'  tf.app.flags.DEFINE_integer 'generations', 1000, 'Number of  training generations.'  tf.app.flags.DEFINE_boolean 'run_unit_tests', False, 'If true, run  tests.'   Need to define a 'main' function for the app to run def main _ :     worker_ips = FLAGS.worker_locations.split ","      learning_rate = FLAGS.learning_rate     generations = FLAGS.generations     run_unit_tests = FLAGS.run_unit_tests  Run the Tensorflow app if __name__ == "__main__":     tf.app.run    321   6.  TensorFlow has built-in logging that we can set the level parameter for. The levels we   can set it at are DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, and FATAL. The default is WARN: tf.logging.set_verbosity tf.logging.WARN   WARN is the default value, but to see more information, you can  set it to     INFO or DEBUG tf.logging.set_verbosity tf.logging.DEBUG   How it works… Here we provide tips for creating production level code in TensorFlow. We want to introduce  these concepts of app-flags, model saving, and logging so that users can consistently write  code with these tools and understand when they see these tools in other code. There are  many other ways to write good production code, but a full example will be shown in the   next recipe.  Productionalizing TensorFlow – An Example A good practice for productionalizing machine learning models is to separate the training and  evaluation programs.  Here, we illustrate an evaluation script expanded to include a unit test,  model saving and loading, and evaluation.  Getting ready For this recipe, we will show how to implement an evaluation script, using the above  production criteria. The code actually consists of a training script and an evaluation script, but  for this recipe, we will only show the evaluation script. As a reminder, both scripts can been  seen in the online GitHub repository, https:  github.com nfmcclure tensorflow_ cookbook .  For the example, we will implement the first RNN example from Chapter 9, Recurrent Neural  Networks, which attempts to predict if a text message is spam or ham. We will assume the  RNN model is trained and saved, along with the vocabulary.  1.  We start by loading the necessary libraries and declaring the TensorFlow application   How to do it…  flags: import os import re import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf  322   from tensorflow.python.framework import ops ops.reset_default_graph   tf.app.flags.DEFINE_string "storage_folder", "temp", "Where to  store model and data."  tf.app.flags.DEFINE_string 'model_file', False, 'Model file  location.'  tf.app.flags.DEFINE_boolean 'run_unit_tests', False, 'If true, run  tests.'  FLAGS = tf.app.flags.FLAGS  2.  We next declare a text cleaning function. This will be the same cleaning function used   in the training script: def clean_text text_string :     text_string = re.sub r' [^\s\w]_[0-9] +', '', text_string      text_string = "".join text_string.split        text_string = text_string.lower       return text_string   3.  Now we can load the vocabulary processing function:  def load_vocab  :     vocab_path = os.path.join FLAGS.storage_folder, "vocab"      vocab_processor = tf.contrib.learn.preprocessing. VocabularyProcessor.restore vocab_path      return vocab_processor   4.  Now that we have a way to clean the text, and have a vocab processor, we can   combine these to create a data-processing pipeline for a given text: def process_data input_data, vocab_processor :     input_data = clean_text input_data      input_data = input_data.split       processed_input = np.array list vocab_processor. transform input_data        return processed_input   5.  Next, we need a way to get data to evaluate. For this purpose, we will ask the user to   type text onto the screen. Then we process the text and return the processed text: def get_input_data  :     input_text = input "Please enter a text message to evaluate:  "      vocab_processor = load_vocab       return process_data input_text, vocab_processor    323   For this example, we have created evaluation data by asking the user to  type it in. While many applications will get data by being supplied a file  or an API request, we can change this input data function accordingly.  6.  For a unit test, we will make sure that our text cleaning function behaves properly:  class clean_test tf.test.TestCase :      Make sure cleaning function behaves correctly     def clean_string_test self :         with self.test_session  :             test_input = '--Tensorflow\'s so Great! Don\t you  think so?   '             test_expected = 'tensorflows so great don you think  so'             test_out = clean_text test_input              self.assertEqual test_expected, test_out   7.  Now that we have our model and data, we can run the main function. The main   function will get the data, set up the graph, load the variables, feed in the processed  data, and print the output: def main args :      Get flags     storage_folder = FLAGS.storage_folder      Get user input text     x_data = get_input_data         Load model     graph = tf.Graph       with graph.as_default  :         sess = tf.Session           with sess.as_default  :              Load the saved meta graph and restore variables             saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph "{}.meta". format os.path.join storage_folder, "model.ckpt"                saver.restore sess, os.path.join storage_folder,  "model.ckpt"                Get the placeholders from the graph by name             x_data_ph = graph.get_operation_by_name "x_data_ph" . outputs[0]             dropout_keep_prob = graph.get_operation_by_ name "dropout_keep_prob" .outputs[0]             probability_outputs = graph.get_operation_by_ name "probability_outputs" .outputs[0]              Make the prediction  324               eval_feed_dict = {x_data_ph: x_data, dropout_keep_ prob: 1.0}             probability_prediction = sess.run tf.reduce_ mean probability_outputs, 0 , eval_feed_dict                Print output  Or save to file or DB connection?              print 'Probability of Spam: {:.4}'.format probability_ prediction[1]    8.  And here is how the main   function or unit tests get run:  if __name__ == "__main__":     if FLAGS.run_unit_tests:          Perform unit tests         tf.test.main       else:          Run evaluation         tf.app.run    How it works… For the evaluation of the model, we were able to load the command-line arguments with  TensorFlow's app flags, load the model and vocabulary processor, and then we were able to  run the processed data through the model and make a prediction.  Remember to run this script through the command line, and check that the training script is  run before to create the model and vocabulary dictionary.  325    11  More with TensorFlow  In this chapter, we'll cover the following recipes:   f Visualizing graphs in Tensorboard  f Working with a Genetic Algorithm  f Clustering Using K-Means  f Solving a System of ODEs  All the code that appears in this chapter is available online at https:  github.com  nfmcclure tensorflow_cookbook.  Introduction Throughout this book, we have seen that TensorFlow is capable of implementing many  models, but there is more that TensorFlow can do, and this chapter will show you a few  of those things. We'll start by showing how to use the various aspects of Tensorboard, a  capability that comes with TensorFlow that allows us to visualize summary metrics, graphs,  and images even while our model is training. The remaining recipes in the chapter will show  how to use TensorFlow's group   function to do stepwise updates. This function will allow   us to implement a genetic algorithm, perform k-means clustering, and even solve a system   of ODEs.  Visualizing graphs in Tensorboard Monitoring and troubleshooting machine learning algorithms can be a daunting task.  Especially if you have to wait a long time for the training to complete before you know the  results. To work around this, TensorFlow includes a computational graph visualization tool  called Tensorboard. With Tensorboard, we can visualize and graph important values  loss,  accuracy, batch training time, and so on  even during training.  327   Getting ready To illustrate the various ways we can use Tensorboard, we will reimplement the linear  regression model from The TensorFlow way of linear regressionrecipe in Chapter 3,  Linear Regression. We'll generate linear data with errors, and use TensorFlow loss and  backpropagation to fit a line to the data. We will show how to monitor numerical values,  histograms of sets of values, andhow to create an image in Tensorboard.  How to do it…  1.  First,we'll load the libraries necessary for the script:  import os import io import time import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import tensorflow as tf  2.  We'll now initialize a session and create a summary writer that can write Tensorboard   summaries to a Tensorboard folder: sess = tf.Session    Create a visualizer object summary_writer = tf.train.SummaryWriter 'tensorboard', tf.get_ default_graph     3.  We need to make sure that the Tensorboard folder exists for the summary writer to   write the Tensorboard logs: if not os.path.exists 'tensorboard' :     os.makedirs 'tensorboard'   4.  We'll now set the model parameters and generate the linear data for the model. Note  that our true slope is 2, and we will visualize the changing slope over time and see it  approach the true value: batch_size = 50 generations = 100  Create sample input data x_data = np.arange 1000  10. true_slope = 2. y_data = x_data * true_slope + np.random.normal loc=0.0, scale=25,  size=1000   328   5.  Next, we'll split the dataset into a train and test set:  train_ix = np.random.choice len x_data , size=int len x_ data *0.9 , replace=False  test_ix = np.setdiff1d np.arange 1000 , train_ix  x_data_train, y_data_train = x_data[train_ix], y_data[train_ix] x_data_test, y_data_test = x_data[test_ix], y_data[test_ix]  6.  Now we can create the placeholders, variables, model operations, loss and optimizing   operations: x_graph_input = tf.placeholder tf.float32, [None]  y_graph_input = tf.placeholder tf.float32, [None]   Declare model variables m = tf.Variable tf.random_normal [1], dtype=tf.float32 ,  name='Slope'   Declare model output = tf.mul m, x_graph_input, name='Batch_Multiplication'   Declare loss function  L1  residuals = output - y_graph_input l2_loss = tf.reduce_mean tf.abs residuals , name="L2_Loss"   Declare optimization function my_optim = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer 0.01  train_step = my_optim.minimize l2_loss   7.  We can now create a Tensorboard operation that will summarize a scalar value. The   scalar value that we will summarize is the slope estimate of the model: with tf.name_scope 'Slope_Estimate' :     tf.scalar_summary 'Slope_Estimate', tf.squeeze m    8.  Another summary we can add to Tensorboard is a histogram summary, which inputs   multiple values in a tensor and outputs graphs and histograms: with tf.name_scope 'Loss_and_Residuals' :     tf.histogram_summary 'Histogram_Errors', l2_loss      tf.histogram_summary 'Histogram_Residuals', residuals   9.  After creating these summary operations, we need to create a summary merging   operation that will combine all the summaries, and then we can initialize the   model variables: summary_op = tf.merge_all_summaries    Initialize Variables init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   329   10.  Now we can train the linear model, and write summaries every generation:  for i in range generations :     batch_indices = np.random.choice len x_data_train ,  size=batch_size      x_batch = x_data_train[batch_indices]     y_batch = y_data_train[batch_indices]     _, train_loss, summary = sess.run [train_step, l2_loss,  summary_op],                              feed_dict={x_graph_input: x_batch,                                         y_graph_input: y_batch}       test_loss, test_resids = sess.run [l2_loss, residuals], feed_ dict={x_graph_input: x_data_test,                                                                         y_graph_input: y_data_test}       if  i+1 %10==0:         print 'Generation {} of {}. Train Loss: {:.3}, Test Loss:  {:.3}.'.format i+1, generations, train_loss, test_loss        log_writer = tf.train.SummaryWriter 'tensorboard'      log_writer.add_summary summary, i   11.  In order to put the final graph of the linear fit with the data points in Tensorboard, we  have to create the graph image in protobuff format. To start this, we will create a  function that outputs a protobuff graph: def gen_linear_plot slope :     linear_prediction = x_data * slope     plt.plot x_data, y_data, 'b.', label='data'      plt.plot x_data, linear_prediction, 'r-', linewidth=3,  label='predicted line'      plt.legend loc='upper left'      buf = io.BytesIO       plt.savefig buf, format='png'      buf.seek 0      return buf   330   12. Now we can create and add the protobuff image to Tensorboard:  slope = sess.run m  plot_buf = gen_linear_plot slope[0]   Convert PNG buffer to TF image image = tf.image.decode_png plot_buf.getvalue  , channels=4   Add the batch dimension image = tf.expand_dims image, 0   Add image summary image_summary_op = tf.image_summary "Linear Plot", image  image_summary = sess.run image_summary_op  log_writer.add_summary image_summary, i  log_writer.close    Be careful writing image summaries too often to Tensorboard. For  example, if we were to write an image summary every generation for  10,000 generations, that would generate 10,000 images worth of  summary data. This can eat up disk space very quickly.  There's more… Be sure to run the preceding script from the command line:  $ python3 using_tensorboard.py  Run the command: $tensorboard --logdir="tensorboard"   Then navigate  to http:  127.0.0.0:6006 Generation 10 of 100. Train Loss: 20.4, Test Loss: 20.5. Generation 20 of 100. Train Loss: 17.6, Test Loss: 20.5. Generation 90 of 100. Train Loss: 20.1, Test Loss: 20.5. Generation 100 of 100. Train Loss: 19.4, Test Loss: 20.5.  We'll then run the preceding specified command to start Tensorboard:  $ tensorboard --logdir="tensorboard" Starting TensorBoard b'29' on port 6006  You can navigate to http:  127.0.1.1:6006   331   Here is a sample of what we can see in Tensorboard:  Figure 1: The scalar value, our slope estimate, visualized in Tensorboard.  332   Here, we can see a plot over the 100 generations of our scalar summary, the slope estimate.  We can see that it does, in fact, approach the true value of 2:  Figure 2: Here we visualize histograms of the errors and residuals for our model.  333   The preceding graph shows one way to view histogram summaries, which can be viewed as  multiple line graphs:  Figure 3: An inserted picture in Tensorboard.  Here is the final fit and data point graph that we put in protobuff format and inserted into  an image summary in Tensorboard.  Working with a Genetic Algorithm TensorFlow can also be used to update any iterative algorithm that we can express in a  computational graph.  One such iterative algorithm is a genetic algorithm, an optimization  procedure.  Getting ready In this recipe, we will illustrate how to implement a simple genetic algorithm. Genetic  algorithms are a way to optimize over any parameter space  discrete, continuous, smooth,  non-smooth, and so on. . The idea is to create a population of randomly initialized solutions,  and apply selection, recombination, and mutation to generate new  and potentially better   child solutions. The whole idea rests on the fact that we can calculate the 'fitness' of an  individual solution by seeing how well that individual solves the problem.  334   Generally, the outline for a genetic algorithm is to start with a randomly initialized population,  rank them in terms of their fitness, and select the top fit individuals to randomly recombine   or cross over  to create new child solutions. These child solutions are then mutated slightly,  to generate new and unseen improvements, and then added back into the parent population.  After we have combined the children and parents, we repeat the whole process again.  Stopping criteria for genetic algorithms vary, but for our purposes we will just iterate for a fixed  amount of generations. We could also stop when our best fit individual achieves a desired  level of fitness or when the maximum fitness does not change after so many generations.  For this recipe, we will keep it simple to illustrate how to do this in TensorFlow. The problem  we will be solving is to generate an individual  an array of 50 floating point numbers  that is  the closest to the ground truth function,  . The fitness will be the negative of the  mean squared error  higher is better  between the individual and the ground truth.  How to do it…  1.  We'll start by loading the necessary libraries for the script:  import os import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import tensorflow as tf  2.  Next, we'll set the parameters of the genetic algorithm. Here, we will have 100   individuals, each with a length of 50. The selection percentage will be 20%  keeping  the top 20 individuals . The mutation will be set to be the inverse of the number  of features, a common place to start for the mutation. This means that we expect  one feature per child solution to change. We will run the genetic algorithm for 200  generations: pop_size = 100 features = 50 selection = 0.2 mutation = 1.  features generations = 200 num_parents = int pop_size*selection  num_children = pop_size - num_parents  3.  We'll initialize the graph session and create the ground truth function, which we will   use to quickly calculate the fitness: sess = tf.Session    Create ground truth truth = np.sin 2*np.pi* np.arange features, dtype=np.float32    features   335   4.  Next we'llinitialize the population as a TensorFlow variable with a random normal input:  population = tf.Variable np.random.randn pop_size, features ,  dtype=tf.float32   5.  We can now create the placeholders for the genetic algorithm. The placeholders    are for the ground truth and also for data that will change for every generation.  Since we want the crossover places between parents to change and the mutation  probabilities values to change, those will be the placeholders in our model: truth_ph = tf.placeholder tf.float32, [1, features]  crossover_mat_ph = tf.placeholder tf.float32, [num_children,  features]  mutation_val_ph = tf.placeholder tf.float32, [num_children,  features]   6.  Now we will calculate the population fitness  negative mean squared error , and find   the top performing individuals: fitness = -tf.reduce_mean tf.square tf.sub population, truth_ph  ,  1  top_vals, top_ind = tf.nn.top_k fitness, k=pop_size   7.  For results and plotting purposes, we also want to retrieve the best fit individual in the   population: best_val = tf.reduce_min top_vals  best_ind = tf.arg_min top_vals, 0  best_individual = tf.gather population, best_ind   8.  Next, we sort the parent population and slice off the top performing individuals to   make them parents for the next generation: population_sorted = tf.gather population, top_ind  parents = tf.slice population_sorted, [0, 0], [num_parents,  features]   9.  Now we'll create the children by creating two parent matrices that are randomly   shuffled. Then we multiple and add the parent matrices by the crossover matrix of 1s  and zeros that we will generate each generation for the placeholders:  Indices to shuffle-gather parents rand_parent1_ix = np.random.choice num_parents, num_children  rand_parent2_ix = np.random.choice num_parents, num_children   Gather parents by shuffled indices, expand back out to pop_size  too rand_parent1 = tf.gather parents, rand_parent1_ix  rand_parent2 = tf.gather parents, rand_parent2_ix   336   rand_parent1_sel = tf.mul rand_parent1, crossover_mat_ph  rand_parent2_sel = tf.mul rand_parent2, tf.sub 1., crossover_mat_ ph   children_after_sel = tf.add rand_parent1_sel, rand_parent2_sel   10.  The last steps are to mutate the children, which we will do by adding a random   normal amount to approximately 1 feature fraction of entries in the children matrix  and concatenate this matrix back into the parent population: mutated_children = tf.add children_after_sel, mutation_val_ph   Combine children and parents into new population new_population = tf.concat 0, [parents, mutated_children]   11.  The final step in our model is to use TensorFlow's group   operation to assign the   new population to the old population variable: step = tf.group population.assign new_population    12. We can now initialize the model variables:  init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   13.  Finally, we loop through the generations, recreating the random crossover and   mutation matrices and updating the population each generation: for i in range generations :      Create cross-over matrices for plugging in.     crossover_mat = np.ones shape=[num_children, features]      crossover_point = np.random.choice np.arange 1, features-1,  step=1 , num_children      for pop_ix in range num_children :         crossover_mat[pop_ix,0:crossover_point[pop_ix]]=0.      Generate mutation probability matrices     mutation_prob_mat = np.random.uniform size=[num_children,  features]      mutation_values = np.random.normal size=[num_children,  features]      mutation_values[mutation_prob_mat >= mutation] = 0       Run GA step     feed_dict = {truth_ph: truth.reshape [1, features] ,                  crossover_mat_ph: crossover_mat,                  mutation_val_ph: mutation_values}     step.run feed_dict, session=sess      best_individual_val = sess.run best_individual, feed_ dict=feed_dict       if i % 5 == 0:  337          best_fit = sess.run best_val, feed_dict = feed_dict         print 'Generation: {}, Best Fitness  lowest MSE : {:.2}'. format i, -best_fit    14.  This results in the following output:  Generation: 0, Best Fitness  lowest MSE : 1.5 Generation: 5, Best Fitness  lowest MSE : 0.83 Generation: 10, Best Fitness  lowest MSE : 0.55 Generation: 185, Best Fitness  lowest MSE : 0.085 Generation: 190, Best Fitness  lowest MSE : 0.15 Generation: 195, Best Fitness  lowest MSE : 0.083  How it works… In this recipe, we have shown you how to use TensorFlow to run a simple genetic algorithm.  To verify that it is working, we can also look at the most fit individual solution and the ground  truth on a plot:  Figure 4: A plot of the ground truth and the best fit individual after 200 generations.  We can see that the best fit   individual is very close to the ground truth.  338   There's more… There are many variations to genetic algorithms. We can have two parent populations with  two different fitness criteria  for example, lowest MSE and smoothness . We could impose  restrictions on the mutation values to not be greater than 1 or less than -1. There are many  different changes we could make, and these changes vary greatly, depending on the problem  we are trying to optimize. For this contrived problem, the fitness was easily calculated, but for  most genetic algorithms, calculating the fitness is an arduous task. For example, if we wanted  to use a genetic algorithm to optimize the architecture of a convolutional neural network, we  could have an individual be an array of parameters. The parameters could stand for the filter  sizes, stride sizes, and so on of each convolutional layer. The fitness of such an individual  would be the accuracy of classification after a fixed amount of iterations through a dataset.  If we have 100 individuals in this population, we would have to evaluate 100 different CNN  models for each generation. This is very computationally intense.  Before using a genetic algorithm to solve your problem, it is wise to figure out how long it takes  to calculate the fitness of an individual. If this operation is time-consuming, genetic algorithms  may not be the best tool to use.  Clustering Using K-Means TensorFlow can also be used to implement iterative clustering algorithms such as k-means. In  this recipe, we show an example of using k-means on the iris dataset.  Getting ready Almost all of the machine learning models we have explored in this book have been  supervised models. TensorFlow is ideal for these types of problems. But we can also  implement unsupervised models if we wish. As an example, this recipe will implement  k-means clustering.  The dataset we will implement clustering on is the iris dataset. One of the reasons this is a  good dataset is because we already know there are three different targets  three types of iris  flowers . This gives us a leg up on knowing that we are looking for three different clusters in  the data.  We will cluster the iris dataset into three groups, and then compare the accuracy of these  clusters against the real labels.  339   How to do it…  1.  To start, we load the necessary libraries. We are also loading some PCA tools from   sklearn so that we can change the resulting data from four dimensions to two  dimensions for visualization purposes: import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import tensorflow as tf from sklearn import datasets from scipy.spatial import cKDTree from sklearn.decomposition import PCA from sklearn.preprocessing import scale  2.  Westart a graph session and load the iris dataset:  sess = tf.Session   iris = datasets.load_iris   num_pts = len iris.data  num_feats = len iris.data[0]   3.  We'll now set the groups, generations, and create the variables we need for the graph:  k=3  generations = 25 data_points = tf.Variable iris.data  cluster_labels = tf.Variable tf.zeros [num_pts], dtype=tf.int64    4.  The next variables we need are the centroids for each group. We will initialize the   centroids for the k-means algorithm by randomly choosing three different points of  the iris dataset: rand_starts = np.array [iris.data[np.random.choice len iris. data  ] for _ in range k ]  centroids = tf.Variable rand_starts   5.  Now we need to calculate the distances between each of the data points and each  of the centroids. We do this by expanding the centroids into a matrix and the same  for the data points. We'll then calculate the Euclidean distances between the two  matrices: centroid_matrix = tf.reshape tf.tile centroids, [num_pts, 1] ,  [num_pts, k, num_feats]  point_matrix = tf.reshape tf.tile data_points, [1, k] , [num_pts,  k, num_feats]  distances = tf.reduce_sum tf.square point_matrix - centroid_ matrix , reduction_indices=2   340   6.  The centroid assignment is then the closest centroid  smallest distance  to each    data point: centroid_group = tf.argmin distances, 1   7.  Now we have to calculate the group average to get the new centroid:  def data_group_avg group_ids, data :       Sum each group     sum_total = tf.unsorted_segment_sum data, group_ids, 3       Count each group     num_total = tf.unsorted_segment_sum tf.ones_like data , group_ ids, 3       Calculate average     avg_by_group = sum_total num_total     return avg_by_group  means = data_group_avg centroid_group, data_points  update = tf.group centroids.assign means , cluster_labels. assign centroid_group    8.  We next initialize the model variables:  init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   9.  We'll iterate through the generations and update the centroids for each group   accordingly: for i in range generations :     print 'Calculating gen {}, out of {}.'.format i, generations       _, centroid_group_count = sess.run [update, centroid_group]      group_count = []     for ix in range k :         group_count.append np.sum centroid_group_count==ix       print 'Group counts: {}'.format group_count    10.  This results in the following output:  Calculating gen 0, out of 25. Group counts: [50, 28, 72] Calculating gen 1, out of 25. Group counts: [50, 35, 65] Calculating gen 23, out of 25. Group counts: [50, 38, 62] Calculating gen 24, out of 25. Group counts: [50, 38, 62]  341   11.  To verify our clustering, we can use the clusters to make predictions. We now see how   many data points are in a similar cluster of same iris species: [centers, assignments] = sess.run [centroids, cluster_labels]  def most_common my_list :     return max set my_list , key=my_list.count   label0 = most_common list assignments[0:50]   label1 = most_common list assignments[50:100]   label2 = most_common list assignments[100:150]   group0_count = np.sum assignments[0:50]==label0  group1_count = np.sum assignments[50:100]==label1  group2_count = np.sum assignments[100:150]==label2  accuracy =  group0_count + group1_count + group2_count  150. print 'Accuracy: {:.2}'.format accuracy    12. This results in the following output:  Accuracy: 0.89  13.  To visually see our groupings and if they have indeed separated out the iris   species, we will transform the four dimensions to two dimensions using PCA, and plot  the data points and groups. After the PCA decomposition, we create predictions on a  grid of x-y values for plotting a color graph: pca_model = PCA n_components=2  reduced_data = pca_model.fit_transform iris.data   Transform centers reduced_centers = pca_model.transform centers   Step size of mesh for plotting h = .02 x_min, x_max = reduced_data[:, 0].min   - 1, reduced_data[:,  0].max   + 1 y_min, y_max = reduced_data[:, 1].min   - 1, reduced_data[:,  1].max   + 1 xx, yy = np.meshgrid np.arange x_min, x_max, h , np.arange y_min,  y_max, h     Get k-means classifications for the grid points xx_pt = list xx.ravel    yy_pt = list yy.ravel    xy_pts = np.array [[x,y] for x,y in zip xx_pt, yy_pt ]  mytree = cKDTree reduced_centers  dist, indexes = mytree.query xy_pts  indexes = indexes.reshape xx.shape   14.  And here is matplotlib code to combine our findings on one graph. This plotting   section of code is heavily adapted from a demo on the sklearn documentation  website  http:  scikit-learn.org stable auto_examples cluster  plot_kmeans_digits.html . plt.clf    342   plt.imshow indexes, interpolation='nearest',            extent= xx.min  , xx.max  , yy.min  , yy.max   ,            cmap=plt.cm.Paired,            aspect='auto', origin='lower'   Plot each of the true iris data groups symbols = ['o', '^', 'D'] label_name = ['Setosa', 'Versicolour', 'Virginica'] for i in range 3 :     temp_group = reduced_data[ i*50 : 50 * i+1 ]     plt.plot temp_group[:, 0], temp_group[:, 1], symbols[i],  markersize=10, label=label_name[i]   Plot the centroids as a white X plt.scatter reduced_centers[:, 0], reduced_centers[:, 1],             marker='x', s=169, linewidths=3,             color='w', zorder=10  plt.title 'K-means clustering on Iris Dataset\n' 'Centroids are marked with white cross'  plt.xlim x_min, x_max  plt.ylim y_min, y_max  plt.legend loc='lower right'  plt.show    Figure 5: Figure showing how the unsupervised classification algorithm of k-means, can be used to group   together the three iris flower species. The three k-means groups are the three shaded regions, and the    three different points  circles, triangles, and diamonds  are the three true species classification.  343   There's more… For this recipe, we clustered the iris dataset into three groups using TensorFlow. Then we  calculated the percentage of data points that fell into similar groups  89%  and plotted a  graph of the resulting k-means groups. Since k-means as a classification algorithm is locally  linear  linear separator up close , it will be hard to learn the naturally non-linear boundary  between I. versicolour, and I. verginica. But one advantage is that the k-means algorithm did  not need labelled data at all to perform.  Solving a System of ODEs TensorFlow can be used for many algorithmic implementations and procedures. A great  example of TensorFlow's versatility is implementing an ODE solver. Solving an ODE numerically  is a iterative procedure that can be easily described in a computational graph. For this recipe,  we will solve the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system.  Getting ready This recipe will illustrate how to solve a system of ordinary differential equations  ODEs . We  can use similar methods to the previous two sections to update values as we iterate through  and solve an ODE system.  The ODE system we will consider is the famous Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system.  This  system shows how a predator-prey system can be oscillating, given specific parameters.  The Lotka-Volterra system was published in a paper in 1920  see also 1 . We will use similar  parameters to show that an oscillating system can occur.  Here is the system represented in a  mathematically discrete way:  Here, X is the prey and Y will be the predator. We determine which is the prey and which is the  predator by the values of a, b, c, and d: For the prey, a>0, b 0.  We will implement this discrete version in the TensorFlow solution to the system.  344   How to do it…  1.  We'll start by loading the libraries and starting a graph session:  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import tensorflow as tf sess = tf.Session    2.  We then declare our constants and variables in the graph:  x_initial = tf.constant 1.0  y_initial = tf.constant 1.0  X_t1 = tf.Variable x_initial  Y_t1 = tf.Variable y_initial   Make the placeholders t_delta = tf.placeholder tf.float32, shape=    a = tf.placeholder tf.float32, shape=    b = tf.placeholder tf.float32, shape=    c = tf.placeholder tf.float32, shape=    d = tf.placeholder tf.float32, shape=     3.  Next, we will implement the prior introduced discrete system and then update the X   and Y populations: X_t2 = X_t1 +  a * X_t1 + b * X_t1 * Y_t1  * t_delta Y_t2 = Y_t1 +  c * Y_t1 + d * X_t1 * Y_t1  * t_delta  Update to New Population step = tf.group    X_t1.assign X_t2 ,   Y_t1.assign Y_t2    4.  We now initialize the graph and run the discrete ODE system with specific parameters   to illustrate a cyclic behavior: init = tf.initialize_all_variables   sess.run init   Run the ODE prey_values = [] predator_values = [] for i in range 1000 :      Step simulation  using constants for a known cyclic  solution      step.run {a:  2. 3. , b:  -4. 3. , c: -1.0, d: 1.0, t_delta:  0.01}, session=sess       Store each outcome     temp_prey, temp_pred = sess.run [X_t1, Y_t1]      prey_values.append temp_prey      predator_values.append temp_pred   345   A steady state  and cyclic  solution to this specific system,  the Lotka-Volterra equations, very much depends on specific  parameters and population values. We encourage the reader to  try different parameters and values to see what can happen.  5.  Now we can plot the predator and prey values: plt.plot prey_values, label="Prey"  plt.plot predator_values, label="Predator"  plt.legend loc='upper right'  plt.show    Figure 6: Here we plot the predator and prey values for the ODE solution. We can see that, indeed, cycles do occur.  How it works… We used TensorFlow to incrementally solve a discrete version of an ODE system. For specific  parameters, we saw that the predator-prey system can indeed have cyclic solutions. This would  make sense in our system biologically, because if there are too many predators, the prey start to  die off, and then there is less food for the predators and they will die off, and so on.
