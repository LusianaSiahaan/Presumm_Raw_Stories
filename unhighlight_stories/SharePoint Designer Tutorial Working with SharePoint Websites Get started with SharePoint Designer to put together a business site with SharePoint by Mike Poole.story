Microsoft Office SharePoint Designer  SPD  is a WYSIWYG HTML  editor and web design program, which has replaced FrontPage, and is the ideal  environment for working with pages on a SharePoint site.  This book is ideal for people new to SharePoint Designer who need to put together  a working SharePoint site as quickly as possible. If you want to get started, and  finished, as quickly as possible, this book is for you. You won't just learn how to use  SharePoint Designer; you'll see how to use it to put together a SharePoint site.   This book will introduce you to the SharePoint Designer environment, and lead  you through the key features as you complete important SharePoint customization  activities. Throughout the book, you will be developing an example site for a wine  business, and you will see what help SharePoint Designer offers, and step through  clear instructions to get things done.   The book begins by familiarizing you with the Designer environment and helping  you to connect to your SharePoint site. You will then learn how to add and format  content, and use SharePoint's workflow tools to collaborate with other content  creators before learning how to connect to different SharePoint data sources. You  will also learn to use ASP.NET Web Parts in your SharePoint site to create calendars,  graphs, integrate with Exchange Server, and add powerful search tools to your site.  What This Book Covers In Chapter 1, we will learn what SharePoint is and why we should choose SharePoint  Designer for developing SharePoint sites. Then, we will learn how to install  SharePoint Designer and connect to an existing SharePoint site.   Preface  In Chapter 2, we will learn what SharePoint Designer does and how to get the most  out of the interface. We will learn how to arrange the IDE's task panes , and about the  benefits of switching between Design view and Code view. We will also get familiar  with the features discretely tucked away on the Status bar to ensure that our pages  conform to agreed standards and will render correctly in the browsers visitors use. In Chapter 3, we will learn how to create a new site, add pages to that site, add text  and graphics to our page, and preview the site in our web browser. We will also  learn how to create tables and will learn about the benefits of layout tables. We will  learn to organize our files and publish our site. We will also learn about the methods  we can use to create a consistent style for our site. In Chapter 4, we will learn to create new pages that follow a consistent theme   and allow other users to contribute towards our site while still keeping our   styles protected. In Chapter 5, we will see that SharePoint Designer is more than just a tool to allow  us to design pretty pages. When used properly, it becomes an integral part of a  company's business processes. In Chapter 6, we will collect data in our SharePoint site and examine the many  methods that SharePoint has for allowing us to display that data. In Chapter 7, we will discover how easy it is to interrogate a whole range of data  sources and display information from them in our SharePoint site in an attractive  and useful manner. In Chapter 8, we will learn what Web Parts are and how they can be added to our   site. We will also learn about the benefits of grouping our Web Parts within Web   Part Zones. In Chapter 9, we will learn about what ASP.NET controls are and which ones are  available to us. We will also see how to implement simple controls, menu controls,  calendar controls, validation controls, and login controls into our pages. In Chapter 10, we will witness the power of the ready-made tools that SharePoint  makes available to us. We will learn how to use OWA Web Parts to display our  Exchange information in our SharePoint site and will learn about the configuration  changes that are required to do so successfully and how to troubleshoot any error  messages that we may come across. In Chapter 11, we will learn to use the search capabilities that SharePoint provides for  us. We will also see how to add search forms and results lists to our pages.  [ 2 ]   Preface  What You Need for This Book  In order to work through the examples in this book you will need to have Microsoft  Office SharePoint Designer 2007 installed on your computer  no surprise there! .  You should also ensure that you have access to a SharePoint site, either on your local  network or across the Internet.  It would also be beneficial to have administrative access to Windows Server 2003 or  2008, Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 and Microsoft SQL Server 2005 for several of  the more advanced examples.  Who This Book is For  This book is ideal for people new to SharePoint Designer who need to put together a  working SharePoint site as quickly as possible.   No experience of SharePoint Designer is expected, and no skill with creating  SharePoint sites is assumed.   Conventions In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between  different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an  explanation of their meaning.  Code words in text are shown as follows: "We could have left the VirtualPath blank  so that server-side scripts are allowed in all SharePoint sites, but limiting it in this  way ensures that only our birthday page has script access."  A block of code will be set as follows:   a:link, a:visited, a:active {    color:903;    padding-top:1px;    padding-bottom:1px;    border-color:903;    border-width:1px;    border-style:solid;    text-decoration:none; } a:hover {    background-color:EEE; }  [ 3 ]   Preface  New terms and important words are introduced in a bold-type font. Words that you  see on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in our text like this:  "We then click the Create button in our Conditional Formatting task pane and select  Apply Formatting ".   Important notes appear in a box like this.  Tips and tricks appear like this.  Reader Feedback Feedback from our readers is always welcome.

[ 5 ]    Introduction to SharePoint  "Collaboration", "empowerment", and "information worker" are common buzzwords  that are never far away in the world of SharePoint promotion, and which accurately  convey the essence of SharePoint.  In this book, we will delve into the matters that are beyond the marketing speak  and gain a deeper understanding of what SharePoint is. We will also learn to use  SharePoint Designer to create and maintain sites that run on the platform.  My hope is that as you come to understand SharePoint better, you will associate your  own adjectives with SharePoint such as "cool", "powerful", and "straightforward".  What is SharePoint? "So, what is SharePoint then?" is a question that I hear frequently, not just from  computer users but also, surprisingly, from savvy IT professionals. With over 24  different Microsoft Server products, it is understandable that not everyone knows  what SharePoint is.  The aim of SharePoint is to improve team productivity by allowing staff to  collaborate efficiently and providing them with the information they require. The  information workers  i.e. staff  are being empowered!  SharePoint is a web-based collaboration, document management, and process  management product that allows us to build an enterprise portal. It provides us  with the framework to create websites that not only provide access to documents  and shared workspaces but also allow other web-based applications such as wikis  and blogs to be created. It also allows elaborate workflows to be created, allowing  business processes to be monitored and actioned.   Introduction to SharePoint  SharePoint makes this possible by pulling together the following existing Microsoft  technologies and making them available to us for use:  ASP.NET  including Web Parts  Internet Information Services  IIS  Active Directory SQL Server              The title, SharePoint, actually refers to two different Microsoft products:  Windows SharePoint Services 3.0  WSS  is a free add-on for   Windows Server 2003 and 2008, which provides us with the following  SharePoint basics:  Basic document management with version control Wiki Blog RSS support Workflows Meeting workspaces Team sites Form library Discussion lists Web part customization     Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007  MOSS  must be purchased  separately, and adds lots of additional functionality to the basic functions  already provided by the WSS Platform:  Improved document management Enterprise search Project management  by integrating with Microsoft by integrating with Microsoft   Project Server  Excel services  only available in the enterprise edition of only available in the enterprise edition of  MOSS 2007   In addition to these, SharePoint is a great way to share and exchange information  such as calendars and to-do lists.  [ 8 ]                                  Chapter 1  Although SharePoint is of benefit to small businesses, which can use it to develop  sites without the need of much customization, the cost of a MOSS implementation  can be prohibitive. Many of the server applications that SharePoint likes to interact  with, such as Active Directory and Exchange Server, are absent from small business  environments. This makes SharePoint a less natural choice for such companies.  SharePoint is more commonly found in medium-sized companies and large  enterprises where the requirement for collaboration is greater  due to the larger  workforce . Larger companies often find it easier and more cost-effective to  implement SharePoint because most of the IT infrastructure is already in place.  Why Choose SharePoint Designer? I am sure you will already have guessed that Microsoft Office SharePoint Designer  2007 is a web design tool that allows us to edit and deploy SharePoint websites.  In this book, we will be using Microsoft Office SharePoint Designer 2007 to build  SharePoint sites.  Microsoft Office SharePoint Designer 2007 is often referred to simply as SPD. I will  refer to it as SharePoint Designer from now on in an attempt to save a few trees as  well as your precious time.  Why choose SharePoint Designer? My reason is this: there is pretty much nothing  that you would want to do to your SharePoint site that you cannot do with  SharePoint Designer. If, on the other hand, you were to design your site using a  product other than SharePoint Designer or Visual Studio, then you would soon find  that you are missing out on being able to use many of SharePoint's built-in features   workflow for example .  With copies selling for US$275  or a pricier £230 on the other side of the Pond   from your favorite online store, it is a little more than you would pay for a copy of  Microsoft Word, but you are buying yourself a lot of power.   Unfortunately, although SharePoint Designer is a part of the Office family, it is not  included in any of the Office system suites.  If you don't already own a copy of SharePoint Designer, it is worth checking if you  are eligible to subscribe to Microsoft's Action Pack that includes annual licenses  for not just SharePoint Designer but also Windows Server 2003, SharePoint Server  Enterprise 2007, and SQL Server 2005 Standard Edition, which are useful if you  would like to build a test SharePoint network.  [ 9 ]   Introduction to SharePoint  What is SharePoint Designer? Even very competent and technically-minded people ask me what SharePoint is  or what SharePoint Designer is. It is not an easy topic to explain. The following  paragraph is how I would sum up SharePoint Designer:  SharePoint Designer fills in the space in the Office family that was vacated by  Microsoft FrontPage  Microsoft's previous HTML editing program . It combines  the familiar Office user interface, which was popular with users of FrontPage, with  the power of Windows SharePoint Services and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server,  allowing data and reports to be built into your SharePoint site easily with the help of  task panes and templates.  This may sound a little obscure or like marketing speak and not really put you in the  picture. Thankfully, like many things in life, it is easier to understand the concept  when we see it in action, so let's dive into it and take a look.  Installing SharePoint Designer If you have not installed SharePoint Designer already, let's kick off by installing it  on our computer. We begin by inserting the installation media  e.g. DVD . We then  enter our product key and click the Continue button.  If our installation does not autorun, then we will need to start the  installation by double-clicking on the setup icon.  [ 10 ]   Next, we carefully read all ten thousand words of the license agreement, tick   the checkbox to say that we accept the terms of the agreement, and click the  Continue button.  Chapter 1  On the next screen, we have the option of installing the default configuration by  clicking the Install Now button or of customizing our installation. Virtually all of SharePoint Designer is installed by default. If we were to click on  the Customize button, we would be able to install additional Office features such  as Japanese font support and proofing tools. We would also be able to specify an  alternative file location and provide different user information.  [ 11 ]   Introduction to SharePoint  We will opt for the default setup by clicking the Install Now button  it is, after all,  larger than the other button, so would seem to be the one that Microsoft would like  us to opt for .  The installation program then spends about three minutes  or longer if we have a  slow computer , installing SharePoint Designer on our system. Once it is finished, we  can click on the Close button. We can then start SharePoint Designer by going to Start  All Programs  Microsoft  Office  Microsoft Office SharePoint Designer 2007.  If we are using another website editing program on our computer, SharePoint  Designer will ask us if we would like to make SharePoint Designer our   default editor.  [ 12 ]   SharePoint Designer will then present us with the activation wizard. Let's go ahead  and activate our product. We are now ready to use SharePoint Designer.  Chapter 1  Connecting to an Existing SharePoint Site Now that we have successfully installed SharePoint Designer on our machine, we  can open up an existing SharePoint site from anywhere on our network, the Internet,  or our local computer.  Virtually, all SharePoint sites are hosted on remote web servers on  networks or on the Internet, but it is also possible to create simpler sites  locally and edit the pages there  e.g. on your laptop when you are on the  move . So, we will also cover that in this book. We will be using a variety of examples in this book to demonstrate  various concepts. In Chapter 3, we will be introduced to the Wine  Company and create a basic site. We will also create other small sites to  illustrate different features.  [ 13 ]   Introduction to SharePoint  To open a site, we go to File  Open Site.  This will present us with the Open Site dialog. We simply type the name of   our site  e.g. http:  olmec   into the Site name field and click Open. Note   that by default, the default SharePoint site name will be the server address    i.e. http:  servername  .  [ 14 ]   SharePoint Designer should then connect to our SharePoint site and list the files and  folders in the Web Site pane in the center of the designer and in the Folder List task  pane on the left of the designer.  Chapter 1  We can only connect to our site if our network login has the necessary  permissions to open the SharePoint site. If it does not, then we will be  prompted to use a login with the necessary permissions.  Further Information Further information about SharePoint Server is available from Microsoft on its main  website at http:  www.microsoft.com sharepoint  and on its Office Online  website at http:  office.microsoft.com sharepoint .  The SharePoint Community Portal is also a good resource, not only because it  provides lots of useful information but also because it is powered by MOSS 2007,  allowing us to see what is possible by taking a peek at the site. Although the main  framework of the community portal is built using MOSS 2007, disappointingly,  many of the sections such as the blog, the forums, and the QnA do not use MOSS  2007 functionality. You can see the community portal at http:  sharepoint. microsoft.com sharepoint .  Summary In this first chapter, we learned what SharePoint is and why we should choose  SharePoint Designer for developing SharePoint sites.  We also installed SharePoint Designer and learned to connect to an existing  SharePoint site. We are now nicely set to continue with the rest of the book.  In the next three chapters, we will become familiar with adding basic content to our  site. We will then move on to discover how to collaborate with contributors and  connect with databases before spending time on the final four chapters of the book,  using Web Parts to extend the functionality of our sites.  [ 15 ]    SharePoint Designer and its  Environment  Now that we have been introduced to SharePoint's powerful capabilities and know  what we would like to build using them, let's find out more about the tool that  would be best to build our masterpiece.  In this chapter, we will cover the following:        We will examine if there is other software that we can use to develop our  SharePoint site. We will take a tour of the integrated development environment  IDE  and  familiarize ourselves with its elements including:            The many task panes that give us access to SharePoint's most  powerful controls. We will learn what they are used for and  how to arrange them neatly on our screen. The benefits of switching between Design and Code view. The command bar. The Status bar.   SharePoint Designer and its Environment  Development Tool Options So, we want to create and maintain our SharePoint site. Which piece of software do  we choose to do this with?           How about Notepad? For half of my first decade as a programmer, I wrote  my HTML and ASP using nothing but Notepad. Even nowadays, I do the  majority of my work in the Code view of whichever IDE I am using. There  is nothing wrong with this; it is often the only way to create truly optimal  code. It would be feasible to code pages using your favorite text editor, but  there are many tasks, such as laying out your Master Pages, Web Part Pages,  or Layout pages, where a WYSIWYG editor is necessary. In any case, much  of the raison d'être for SharePoint is to allow content creators to easily add  pages to their site, so let's not make things difficult for ourselves by choosing  a tool that is too basic. Visual Studio 2005 then? It is brimming with features and can be a good  option if you are a developer, as you almost certainly already have this  product and will be familiar with how it operates. It is an expensive  option, although you can download the perfectly adequate Visual Web  Developer 2005 Express Edition for free from http:  msdn.microsoft. com vstudio express vwd . It is also worth noting that Visual Studio and  Office SharePoint Designer can be used together by different team members  to build a site. Visual Studio also allows us to perform complex tasks,  such as modifying onet.xml, building application pages on the server file  system, writing custom Web Parts, workflow actions, and event receivers.  The downside of using Visual Studio is that it has no knowledge of the  SharePoint platform, and hence it does not offer a rich design experience    e.g. property grids, WYSIWYG, Web Part customization . FrontPage's successor aimed at designers, Expression Web, allows excellent  control of the look of our sites, but would not be a suitable choice for  developing SharePoint sites because it does not allow SharePoint sites to   be opened.  As you will no doubt have guessed from the title of the book, there is another  product we should consider—Microsoft Office SharePoint Designer 2007.  Tour of the Environment Let's fire up SharePoint Designer and take a look around.  If you are familiar with Visual Studio, the first thing you will notice about the design  environment is that SharePoint Designer looks remarkably similar to Visual Studio.  The other thing that may catch your eye  especially, if you are using a large monitor    [ 18 ]   is that there is a big expanse of nothingness in the middle of the screen. This blank  canvas is where we will build our creation.  Chapter 2  Task Panes Before we begin tinkering with SharePoint Designer, notice that by default four task  panes are open for us to use:           Folder List Tag Properties Toolbox Manage Styles  If we have already altered the task panes that are open in the designer, we  can reset the task panes to the default view by clicking on Task Panes   Reset Workspace Layout.  [ 19 ]   SharePoint Designer and its Environment  Because we are not currently editing a page, the contents of these task panes are  either empty or grayed out.  We can open any of the 24 task panes that SharePoint Designer provides us with by  selecting them from Task Panes on the menu bar. As we do this, notice that some of  the task panes add extra tabs to existing task panes, forming groups of task panes.  For example, when we go to Task Panes and click on Navigation, it groups the new  Navigation task pane alongside the existing Folder List task pane. It is possible to  "tear off" tabs and re-group them in a different pane, if we decide that the default  groupings do not suit our design style. SharePoint Designer will save any changes  to the environment to the registry when we close the program to ensure that our  settings remain the same the next time we open the designer.  We can have up to six groups of task panes on our page and could in theory have all  our task panes open simultaneously.  Let's take a look at what each of the task panes does:     Folder List displays all the folders and files in our SharePoint site. As we  have not created or opened a site, the list is currently empty. When we  create a new site, this pane fills with all the content within the site, as in the  following example of a newly created mysite  mysite contains the personal  pages, which are displayed in a SharePoint site at http:     personal    .  [ 20 ]   Chapter 2     Navigation is similarly empty until we open a site. Once our site is open, we  can use it to configure our site's navigational items, such as the navigation  bar. We can see an example of a populated Navigation task pane in the image  below. The Quick Launch items that you see in the image populate the Quick  Launch bar that appears down the left-hand side of a SharePoint site.     Tag Properties allows us to specify all manner of properties for the entity we  have selected on our page. The options that are available vary depending on  what type of item we are editing. If, for example, we have inserted an ASP. NET button control onto our page, we can specify formatting details  e.g.  the background color or text that appears on the button , or we can specify  actions that the button will perform  e.g. the tooltip text which appears that  the user hovers their cursor over the button .  [ 21 ]   SharePoint Designer and its Environment                       CSS Properties allows us to see the style information for the element that we  have selected on our web page and to edit that style. This task pane gives us  a huge degree of control over the styles on our page, not only allowing us to  specify one style but also to change the order of precedence of many different  styles. In addition, there is a Summary button that allows us to easily see  exactly what CSS is cascading to the selected element and understand exactly  how to change its appearance. Layout Tables offers some very powerful features to allow us to instantly  create the layout for our new page by creating a table from ten pre-specified  table designs and specifying the dimensions of the table and its cells. Apply Styles allows us to choose a style that we will give to our selected  entity. These styles might simply specify the font size and color, but can also  be used to give us precise control of entity positioning and borders. This task  pane can be set to show all styles used in our site, or just the styles used on  the current page. In addition, we can create new styles or attach previously  created CSS pages. Manage Styles is where we specify the styles that are used in the Apply  Styles task pane. We can either create a new style or select an existing CSS  style sheet. We can categorize our styles by CSS order, by element, or by  type. We can also create new styles or attach CSS using this task pane. On the  left side of the list of selectors, there is an icon indicating whether the selector  is a class, an HTML tag, or an ID. Behaviors will be very familiar to the users of Adobe Dreamweaver. This  task pane allows us to specify events that take place when an action is  performed at run time. For example, a sound can play or a rollover effect can  be displayed on an image. Layers will be familiar to those of us that have used DHTML in the past.  It allows content to be placed in front of or behind other content to create  effects such as those annoying adverts we see, obscuring the content of web  pages. Fortunately, they can also be used to enrich our sites. Toolbox is our indispensible task pane. If we could take one task pane with  us onto a desert island  along with our computer, power supply, broadband,  etc., etc. , this would be the one to choose. We can drag HTML, ASP.NET,  and SharePoint elements from here and drop them onto our page. The ASP. NET Web Parts in this task pane are not suitable for use in SharePoint sites.  SharePoint Web Parts are displayed in the Web Parts task pane, when we are  connected to a SharePoint server.  [ 22 ]                  Chapter 2  Data Source Library controls the connections to the many different types  of data sources that SharePoint allows us to use  e.g. ODBC database  connections, XML files and web services, SharePoint lists, and libraries . The  task pane displays the data sources for our current site, and can also display  data sources for other sites  as long as we have the 'open web' permission on  those sites . Data Source Details displays the information stored in our selected data  source. It displays the contents of every field and allows us to page through  the data, one record at a time. When we drag a data source from this task  pane onto our web page, SharePoint Designer automatically creates a Data  View, displaying the first five records contained in the data source on our  page. This task pane allows us to see all of the data inside the data source  of a currently selected Data View, or inside a data source we chose to view  by clicking Show Data in the Data Source Library. We can also modify the  source properties from this task pane, scroll through the records to see the  hierarchy of our data source  this is particularly useful when working with  XML data , view the XPath expression for each field, and to save space,  can choose not to show the actual data, but rather just the schema for our  source. When we drag a data source from this task pane onto our web page,  SharePoint Designer creates a Data View, displaying all the records for that  data source, unless there are more than 24 records, in which case, the view is  paged to 10. For XML data, we insert the first five columns  if there are five   of the first repeating region. For List data, we insert three columns. Conditional Formatting is the same principle as the conditional formatting  in Microsoft Excel. It allows us to automatically change the style of an HTML  tag or data value in our Data View, depending on the values we specify. For  example, if we want all account balances of less than $250 to be in bold text  with a red background, this can be set up using Conditional Formatting. Find Data Source allows us to find the data source we would like to use. This  is particularly important if our site contains a large number of data sources,  or if we are working with multiple sites. To find the data source we would  like to use, we simply select the location from the drop-down list, then type a  search phrase  e.g. "links"  into the For: field. Web Parts allows us to harness the power of the underlying .NET 2.0  framework by dragging and dropping all manner of ready-made controls  onto our page. This is great because most, if not all, of the work for common  tasks, such as displaying task lists or building forms, has already been done  for us. SharePoint Designer regularly queries the server to check which Web  Parts are available in order to keep this task pane up to date.  [ 23 ]   SharePoint Designer and its Environment                          Find 1 and Find 2 allow us to find or find and replace instances of a text  string on our page or in the underlying code  depending upon whether  Design view or Code view is selected . The find tools are extremely powerful  and allow us to use regular expressions to conduct our search. We are also  able to build highly complex HTML rules  e.g. find all instances of the word  foo that exist inside table cells, that are inside divs, that have an attribute  called bar and a value of baz . These searches can also be saved and then  reused or shared. Accessibility allows us to check that design-time HTML complies with  most of the disability legislation, which is in place to help users with visual  impairments use our site. SharePoint Designer will not ensure that the   run-time HTML is compliant, so it is a good idea to also check the site   using an accessibility evaluation tool such as the ones listed at   http:  www.w3.org WAI ER tools . Compatibility allows us to ensure that our site conforms to the CSS,   HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0 and 1.1 standards used by standard-compliant  browsers such as Firefox and Safari. We can also check that our site will  run on various versions of Internet Explorer, which does not adhere to the  standards as closely. Hyperlinks will display a report of the internal and external links on our site  and check to see if any of these are broken. CSS Reports is great for detecting and removing unused styles from our site.  It will also display a list of styles that are used on a page. Clip Art allows us to search our computer and Microsoft's online image bank  for clip art and photos and display those on our web page. A word of caution  before adding dancing telephones to your company's contact page. Just  because you can to do, it does not mean your marketing department is going  to approve of it. Clipboard will store up to 24 of the most recent items we have copied or cut  from any of the applications on our computer and allow these to be pasted  into our web page. Contributor shows us the contributor settings for our site. Collaboration is  one of the most powerful features of SharePoint. It allows groups of users  to be set up, each with different permissions for viewing and editing a site.  By default, this task pane will probably show us as members of the Content  Authors group, which has some power to edit our pages, but does not allow  us complete world domination.  [ 24 ]   Organizing Our Task Panes Once we have opened our task panes using the Task Panes menu, we have complete  control over where we position those task panes on the page:  Chapter 2  Move a task pane by clicking and dragging on the title bar of our task pane. If  we drag it to the edge of the program window and let go, it will dock neatly  onto the page either vertically  if we drag it to the left or the right of the  window  or horizontally  if we drag it to the bottom or the top of the window . Resize the task panes by hovering the mouse cursor over the edge of the task  pane until the cursor changes to a double-headed arrow and drag the border  out or up. Close task panes we are not using by clicking on the Close cross in the   top-right of the task pane. If our task panes have been grouped together,  then we can either click on the upper cross to close the whole group or on the  lower cross to close the active task pane.  Merge task panes together into groups by clicking on the title bar of a task  pane and dragging it onto another task pane. We can even merge groups into  other groups by clicking on the title bar of the group and dragging it onto  another group. Stack your task panes or groups of task panes into one column by dragging  the title bar of your task pane or group into an existing column of task panes.  We can then use the Maximize button, when we would like to access the  contents of that task pane. If you are using a monitor that has low screen  resolution, you may find it helpful to stack your task panes in one column  because you will then have enough room in the Design view to build your  web pages. Float a task pane anywhere on the screen by right-clicking on the task pane's  title bar and selecting Float from the very short shortcut menu. If you are  fortunate enough to have a computer with multiple monitors, you may like  to have SharePoint Designer filling one screen and float all your task panes  on the other. Restore task panes to their default position once you have arranged them in  a confusing enough manner by selecting Reset Workspace Layout from your  Task Panes menu.  [ 25 ]                        SharePoint Designer and its Environment  If you want to be a real whiz, try the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Tab to cycle through  the task panes in a group  or Ctrl + Shift + Tab to cycle through them backwards . Another point to note is that in some of the task panes  e.g. Accessibility , it   may not be immediately obvious that to run a report we must first click on the small  green arrow.  Code View In the center of our design environment, we have the area where we will be building  our pages. Clicking in this area allows us to start typing the text that will be on our  page. It works in much the same way as Microsoft Word does. We can type some  text, highlight it, and format it using different font faces, colors, and sizes. This is of  course what is known as the WYSIWYG  What You See Is What You Get  method of  working and is nice and straightforward. Microsoft makes a big deal about the fact  that we can build SharePoint sites in this way without the need to type any code.  That is great for casual users who just want to copy and paste their information onto  a web page, but it does not mean that more experienced developers cannot tinker  under the bonnet if they want to. This is where the Code tab comes in; it allows the  view to be flicked from the Design view to the Code view at the click of a tab. You  can see the Code tab at the foot of the workspace pane.  When we click on the Code tab, the HTML of our page is displayed.  [ 26 ]   Chapter 2  If you think the code that SharePoint Designer creates looks a little confusing, let me  assure you that it is far tidier and easier to work with than the code that Microsoft  FrontPage used to create. The eagle-eyed among us will have noticed there is also a third tab called Split.  When we click this, it takes us into Split view, which shows us the Code view in a  pane at the top of the page at the same time as the Design view in a pane beneath  it. When we work in either of these panes, it moves the other pane up and down,  depending on where on the page we are working. Notice that when we highlight an  element on the page, it highlights the associated item in the other pane. Nice!  If we are blessed with multiple monitors  and I really do recommend that if you are  not, you do everything in your power to ensure that you are, because you will never  look back! , SharePoint Designer allows us to make full use of our additional screen  area. We can right-click on a page that is in Design view and select the Open Page in  New Window option. We can move this window to our second monitor and change  the view to Code view. This allows us to make changes on one screen and see the  changes occur in the other automatically. Now that is slick. In this book, we will concentrate on designing our site using the Design view,  but occasionally we will flick into the Code view for a brief demonstration of how  additional functionality can be added to our site, if we should feel so inclined. You  may never use the Code view, but it can still be useful to know what can be done  should you wish so.  The Button Bar At the time when the majority of the Microsoft Office suite has upgraded to a shiny  new chunky tabbed ribbon bar, SharePoint Designer has retained the traditional  command bar at the top of its screen. By default, the Common button bar is  displayed, which mainly allows us to format our highlighted text.  [ 27 ]   SharePoint Designer and its Environment  By right-clicking on the empty space to the right of the Common button bar, we  bring up a shortcut menu, which allows us to display other button bars that are  specific to various tasks, such as inserting tables or selecting which Master Page our  page should use.  The Status Bar The grey Status bar at the foot of the designer displays a host of useful information  to help us design pages that not only look good in the designer but also work well in  real life.  From left to right, the Status bar shows us the following helpful information:     The Contextual Message will usually say For Help, press F1  and this is a  good tip because I have found the help in SharePoint Designer to be very  comprehensive . The message will change occasionally as we develop our  site to display useful information. For example, when we click on a hyperlink  in the Design view, it will display the target address.  [ 28 ]               Chapter 2  Visual Aids are useful markers and error messages, which are displayed on  the page at design time to help us compose our page. They do not appear  to a visitor when they view our web page. The Visual Aids can be toggled  on and off by double-clicking on the Status bar cell. Right-clicking on this  cell displays a shortcut menu where we can select which visual aids are  displayed in the designer, when Visual Aids is set to On. Personally, I find  the Margins and Padding visual aid very useful. Style Application allows us to switch between automatic application of site  styles and manual application of styles, which allows us more control of   how our page looks. Manual style application can be at the expense of a  uniform-looking site and should only be used by a developer with a good  grasp of CSS. It allows us to render classes and selectors in exactly the way  we would like them to appear  e.g. using our corporate colors rather than the  default colors provided by SharePoint . Download Statistics displays the total file size of our HTML and the files  embedded on the page. Over time, as the average user's internet connection  has become faster, it has become less important that a page is small so that  it downloads in good time, but the cost of bandwidth has also risen over the  same period. If you pay for the bandwidth used by your web server, then  keeping your page sizes small will help keep your bills small. Generally  speaking, pages should not need to be more than 60-100KB in size. If the size  of our pages is dramatically high, then the first thing we would want to try  doing is reduce the quality of our JPEG images, which can halve the overall  page size. It is also important to note that the statistics do not include the  sizes of any images that are dynamically displayed on the page. For example,  if we have a product page that displays information about a bottle of wine   if you like wine, you will love the example site we are going to build in  this book , then that page will display one of hundreds of pictures of wine  bottles automatically, depending on which product was selected. In this case,  SharePoint Designer does not know which image will be selected, so does  not include that file information in the download statistics. This is especially  important to bear in mind because such dynamic images are cached less  frequently and so will result in higher bandwidth usage. Standard Rendering Mode will display the word Standard if our site  conforms to an agreed doctype. If we would like to check that our site renders  nicely in Internet Explorer 6  and we should! , then we can double-click on  this area and change the Secondary Schema to Internet Explorer 6.0, thereby  enabling the Quirks mode. More information about quirks mode can be found  at http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Quirks_mode.  [ 29 ]            SharePoint Designer and its Environment  Page Size displays the current dimensions of our Design view. The width of  the page in pixels is displayed first, then the height. Right-clicking on this cell  brings up a shortcut menu, which allows us to select different dimensions for  our page or to create our own page sizes. The dimensions in brackets refer to  the screen resolution, whereas the dimensions in front of the brackets refer to  the available space within the typical browser window on that screen  given  that users seem to collect toolbars, the available vertical space may be less  than this guideline predicts . Setting the page dimensions is a feature that  we should seriously consider using in all our sites, so that users with smaller  screens can view our site without the need to scroll left and right. More  importantly, it will mean we don't get an embarrassing phone call asking us  why our site does not print off properly.  Document Schema shows the HTML or XHTML doctype declaration that is  displayed in the HTML. The doctype declaration tells the browser what type  of HMTL is being used. By default, the more recent XHTML 1.0 Transitional  is used. To change the doctype, double-click on this cell in the Status bar  or  if you want to take longer to do exactly the same thing, use Tools  Page  Editor Options on the menu bar . Choosing the correct doctype allows  SharePoint Designer to suggest appropriate options through its built-in  IntelliSense. SharePoint Designer will alert us to code that does not conform  to our chosen doctype by using red squiggles and yellow highlighting.  For more information about doctype standards, see the World Wide Web  Consortium website at http:  www.w3.org MarkUp . CSS Schema is similar to the doctype, but tells the user's browser which  version of Cascading Style Sheets is being used on the page. By default,   it is set to CSS 2.1, which is the most recent version. This tool works in a  similar way to the Document Schema tool, by allowing us to check the  validity of our code. For more information about CSS standards see   http:  www.w3.org Style CSS .  [ 30 ]   Chapter 2  Summary In this chapter, we learned what SharePoint Designer does and how to get the most  out of the interface. We learned how to arrange the task panes in the IDE so that we  could get access to the controls that we need in a way that suits our working style  and the benefits of switching between Design view and Code view. We are also now  familiar with the features discretely tucked away on the Status bar, and aware that  they are at our disposal, so that we can ensure that our pages conform to agreed  standards and will render correctly in the browsers visitors use.  In Chapter 3, we will crack on with creating a new site which we will add content  and tables.  [ 31 ]    Adding Content and Tables  Now that we have learned about the foundations of SharePoint and the designer,  let's crack on and build and publish our first page.  But first, a few words about wine.  The Wine Company The Wine Company Limited is a fictitious company that has been selling wines from  all over the world via the Internet to customers in the UK, since March 2000. it grew  from humble beginnings and now employs 25 people at its office and warehouse  complex in the central belt of Scotland. Its staff includes one marketing manager  called Gavin and an all-round IT person called Tony, who looks after everything  from PC support to database management. Tony is also responsible for maintaining  the company websites.  Over the last seven years, the company has had two public facing e-commerce  websites developed by local companies, but in the summer of 2007, with the help of  a SharePoint consultant, decided that SharePoint was finally mature enough to meet  its needs.  Throughout this book, we will be using the Wine Company website as our example.  Creating a New Site Let us proceed and build our first page. We could just create a page straight away,  but because we would like to publish our page to the SharePoint server, once we  have done so, we will create a new site, which we will call "hello world". To create a  new site, follow these steps:  1.  From the menu bar in SharePoint Designer, select File  New  Web Site. 2.  Select Empty Web Site from the list of possible pages.   Adding Content and Tables  3.  We can store our local version of the site anywhere we wish on our computer  or network. For now on, we will use the default location inside My Documents  because it is as good a place as any. Give your new site a new folder within  the My Web Sites folder  e.g., C:\Users\ \Documents\My Web  Sites\hello world .  4.  Click OK.  Note that during this process, we created a new folder for our hello  world site. This is important because usually we will create more than  one website on our computer. Having our sites in different folders helps  keep things tidy  and as you will see, I like tidiness! .  When going through this process, we will see the New dialog which will be similar  to the one below.  [ 34 ]   Chapter 3  Creating Our First Page If we had selected the One Page Web Site option in the previous section, a blank  page called Untitled_1.htm would have been displayed in the center of our  designer. It would have been possible for us to have used this as our first page, but I  recommend we use a different type of page for all the web pages in our site.  HTML pages  i.e. files with the .htm suffix  are simple souls. They will display  static information very nicely, but when it comes to actually doing something  such  as displaying a list of products contained in our database , they will shrug their  shoulders and say they can't do that.  If you want your pages to do more than look pretty  and I am sure you do because  you have an interest in SharePoint , then Active Server Pages are for you. The latest  generation of ASP pages have.aspx as their suffix.  I recommend always creating ASPX pages because they can contain dynamic  content, SharePoint-specific controls, and other ASP.NET controls when necessary.  For example, if we start with an HTML page, which only displays a photo and a few  paragraphs of text, then the time comes when we decide we want to quickly add a  list of the top ten bottles of wine from our database to that page and we will have to  tear up the old HTML page and create it as a new ASPX page. When we do this, not  only will all the links to the page on our site and other websites need to change, but  we will also lose any good search engine rank the page had and any bookmarks that  people had pointing to that page. So, I think it is better to just start with ASPX, even  if we don't have any dynamic content to start with. To add a new page, select File  New  ASPX from the menu bar.  [ 35 ]   Adding Content and Tables  The first thing we should do is give our page a more meaningful filename and save it  to our hard drive:  1.  Select File  Save. 2.  Leave the default location as C:\Users\ \Documents\My Web   Sites\hello world.  3.  Change the File name to default. 4.  Save as type ASPX Files. 5.  Click Change title… and type Hello World and press OK.  [ 36 ]   This has saved our empty page to our hard drive. You will notice that a couple of  things happened when we did this. Firstly, the name of our file changed to   default.aspx, as we would expect, but it has also added a new Web Site tab to our  tabs in the workspace.  Chapter 3  Adding and Formatting Text You will notice in the white workspace there is a tag that says formform1. This  means that there is a form on the page with an ID of form1. All ASPX pages are  required to have a form tag, so SharePoint Designer inserts one for us.  Now, let's go ahead and add some text to our page. Click inside the white workspace  and type the words Hello World. For the purpose of this exercise, it does not matter  if we type within the formform1 area or in the blank space beneath it. Once we have done that, we hit the Enter key and add some more text beneath our  Hello World text. We can make our Hello World text into a heading by doing the following:   1.  Highlight the Hello World text on the page. 2.  Click on the Style drop-down on the Common button bar and select the   3.  Remove the extra carriage return that SharePoint Designer added in front of   Heading 1   option.  your second sentence.  You will notice that so far this has not been any more difficult than using Microsoft  Word to add content.  [ 37 ]   Adding Content and Tables  Once we have finished making these changes, we must remember to save our page.  There is plenty more that we can do to format our page nicely, but we will save that  for the next chapter.  Previewing Our Page SharePoint allows us to quickly check what our page looks like inside the browsers  that are installed on our computer. To preview our page, we go to File  Preview in Browser and select the browser we  would like to use. Once we have previewed our page, for the first time, use anything  but the first item in the list; don't be fooled into thinking that our browser is no  longer on the list. It has simply moved up to first place on the list.  [ 38 ]   Chapter 3  To quickly preview our page at any time, we can hit F12. You may have noticed that when we preview our pages, a small icon is added to our  system tray. This is because our computer requires a web server to display our page  in the browser. Rather than forcing us to install and configure Internet Information  Server  IIS  and the latest .NET framework on our computer, it quickly starts the  ASP.NET Development Server, which serves our page for us. This server will  continue to run on our PC until we either double-click on the icon and click Stop, or  close SharePoint Designer.  Don't worry that the port number you see is different from the one in the graphic  below, because a different number is selected each time the Development Server   is started.  Creating Hyperlinks Now that we have seen what our page looks like in the browser, let's return to the  designer and add a hyperlink.  We can make text link to other pages on our site or on the Internet, allowing users to  click trough to those pages:  1.  Type "Visit the Wine Company." onto our page. 2.  Highlight the text you would like to use as the linking text     i.e. "Wine Company" .  3.  Go to Insert  Hyperlink.  [ 39 ]   Adding Content and Tables  4.  Either browse to a page we would like to link to, if we are linking to another   page on our site, or type an address into the Address drop-down list  e.g.  http:  www.winecompany.co.uk , if we are linking to an external site.  Notice that we can also use the Insert Hyperlink dialog to insert a link to an email  address  so that it creates a new message addressed to our chosen recipient in the  user's email client . We can also specify the target frame or window that the new   web page will open in. In addition, there is a Parameters button that allows us   to pass information from one page to the other, which is useful when creating  dynamic applications.  [ 40 ]   Chapter 3  When choosing suitable text to use for our link, we should bear in mind that it is  more useful to users if we use descriptive text for our links. For example, using the  text "contact us" or "red wine" is more useful than lots of links dotted around our  page saying "click here" or "here".  Adding Images We will take this opportunity to add the Wine Company logo to our test page. The  most common type of image used on web pages for full color images is a JPEG and  our logo is no exception.  You can find the logo in the code bundle that you get along with this book. For  further details, refer to the Downloading the Example Code for the Book section   in the Preface.  Before we can add the logo to our page, we must first copy the logo into our website  folder, rather than just inserting the logo from wherever it happens to be on our  computer. The reason for this is that when we publish our site to the SharePoint  server, we also want to make sure that all the files that are used in the site, including  images, are published with it. If we were to publish a page that used an image on  our C drive, it may display fine to us  because the browser would be able to find  the image on our hard disk , but the image would not appear to users of other  computers because they would not have the image on their computers.  Go ahead and copy the logo into the hello world folder that was automatically  created within the My Web Sites folder, which is in the My Documents  or just  Documents, if you are using Windows Vista  folder on your computer. You should  already see the default.aspx file we created earlier in that folder. Because I am an  organized soul, I would usually make a folder called images within the My Web Sites  folder and put the image there, but because we are just creating a small test site, let's  not worry about that.  It is also possible to import images directly into our site's Folder List  using SharePoint Designer by selecting File  Import from the menu.  Now that we have copied the image into the folder our site uses, let's return to  SharePoint Designer and insert the logo into our page by clicking on the spot on the  page where we would like our logo and selecting Insert  Picture  From File.... This  allows us to browse to the hello world folder, select the image, and insert it to our  page. It is also possible to drag and drop the image from our Folder List onto the  design surface.  [ 41 ]   Adding Content and Tables  By default, we will see an Accessibility Properties dialog before the image is added.  This allows us to specify Alternate text, which will be used by speech browsers used  by the blind. Something meaningful, such as "Wine Company logo", should be added  here, rather than an unhelpful generic term like "picture". It should also be noted that  search engines also use this ALT text in their algorithms, so it is in our best interest to  use something meaningful wherever possible  e.g. the name of the product we are  selling . The Long description is not as necessary.  Creating Tables Web designers love using tables  often perhaps when they should not, but more  about this later in the chapter . It is not uncommon for a single web page to have  three or more tables nested inside one another. We will add a table to our test page  that will display a list of the company's five bestselling wines, with the help of the  following steps:  1.  Go to Table  Insert Table. 2.  Change the Size options to 7 for Rows and 3 for Columns. 3.  Set Alignment to Center. 4.  Under Specify width, type 450 instead of the default 100. 5.  Click the In pixels radio button. 6.  Set the Cell padding to 5 and the Cell spacing to 0. 7.  Click OK.  We can now click inside the table, which was created, and type our data like so:  Believe it or not, these are the names of real wines  not made-up names such as   Nasti Spumante . As we type the data into the cells, notice how the width of the columns automatically  resizes to give the text the best fit.  Once we have created our table, we can edit the table properties at any time by right- clicking on the table and selecting Table Properties… from the shortcut menu.  [ 42 ]   Chapter 3  Table and Cell Properties Let's take a more detailed look at the table options:        Size allows us to specify how many rows and columns our table has. A word  of caution—if our columns are going to have anything longer than a few  words in them, then we will probably want to keep the number of columns  to five or less, so that our page does not become too wide. Layout allows us to control the size and location of our table as well as the  size of the gaps in and around the cells:                    Alignment allows our table to be positioned on the left, in the  center, or on the right of our page. Float can be set so that our table floats to the left or to the  right of the page. "So how is Float different from Alignment?"  I hear you ask. Good question. The difference is that when  Float is enabled, the content on the page outside of the table  will wrap around the table nicely. Cell padding specifies the size of the margin in pixels,  between the content of the cell and the edge of the cell. Cell spacing is similar to Cell padding, but is the size of the  margin between different cells. The choice whether to use  Cell padding or Cell spacing to provide space between the  contents of our cells only really needs to be made if our table  has a visible border or background color. Specify width allows us to enter either a set width for our  table  if we click In pixels  or a percentage of the page or cell  width  if we select In percent . A table does not need to have  a specified size, but it is a good idea to provide one so that  we can be sure about how wide our table will be. If we do not  specify a size, the table will become whatever width other  content on the page thinks it should be. Specify height, on the other hand, is usually left blank,  allowing the table to continue down the page for as long as  it requires. It should be noted that when specifying height or  width, using fixed sizes rather than percentages is preferred by  the standards bodies  see http:  www.w3.org TR REC-CSS2  tables.html for more information about table standards .  [ 43 ]   Adding Content and Tables     Borders allows us to specify the width and color of any borders that we  might use in our table:     Background allows us to edit the background details of our site with the help  of the following options:                 Size allows us to specify how many pixels wide the outer  border of our table is. If we do not want to have a border,  then we simply select 0. If we specify a border of greater  than zero, then a border of one pixel wide will also appear  between each of the cells in our table. Color gives us the opportunity to not only make the border  of our table a nice color to match the rest of our page, but also  remove the basic 3D effect that some browsers render wider  borders with. Collapse table border changes the table from using W3C's  Separated Borders Model to using their Collapsing Border  Model. In the Collapsing model, it is possible to specify  borders that surround individual cells, rows, and columns   and indeed row groups and column groups . This model is  rather complex and would take a good number of pages to  describe, so I won't go into it any deeper here  see http:   www.w3.org TR REC-CSS2 tables.htmlborders for  further details of these models .  Color allows us to set the background color for the entire  table. Clicking on More colors… provides us with a web-safe  color picker. Web-safe colors are those that will display on  any monitor. Because of advancements in screen technology,  colors ceased needing to be web safe to display on our  computers a good while ago  our monitors now tend to be far  better than our eyes! . Interestingly, though, now that mobile  devices have become more common, some thought again  needs to be given to choosing colors that are web safe. Use background picture allows an image on our web server  to be used as the background pattern for our table. As with  other graphical techniques, this should be used with care,  otherwise it can look garish and can make the content of the  table more difficult to read. When used sparingly, specifying  a background image allows some very nice techniques.  For instance, we can use a subtle faded flag image for each  country behind the name of the wine, when editing the  background images of individual cells.  [ 44 ]   Chapter 3  Set as default for new tables does exactly what it says on the tin. If we  would like to create a lot of similar tables, then checking this box will  automatically create future tables that are the same as the one we have   just created.  In addition to being able to specify properties for the whole table, we can also specify  properties for individual cells. To do this, we right-click in the cell we would like to  edit and select Cell Properties… from the shortcut menu. Many of the options for the cells are the same as those that we saw for the whole  table. The additional options are:  Horizontal alignment allows us to position our content on the left, center, or  right of the cell. It also gives us the opportunity to justify our text, which can  look smart, if the columns are fairly wide. If our columns are not wide, then  selecting the Justify option can make the text look silly, because with only a  few words per line, there will be large gaps between words. Vertical alignment is useful when we have very little content in one column  but a lot of content in the column beside it  causing the rows to be fairly  tall . By default, the user's browser will display the content of these cells  in the middle of the cell  i.e. neither at the top nor at the bottom . My own  preference in these situations is that the content is displayed at the top of  the cell, so I would set the Vertical alignment to Top. It is also possible to  align the content to the bottom of the cell or to the baseline by setting the  Vertical alignment to Bottom or Baseline. The Baseline command has the  same effect as the Bottom one, if the same sized fonts are being used, because  it lines up the text using an imaginary line that the text rests on. It becomes  useful when the fonts in the neighboring cells are of different sizes. Rows spanned allows us to merge our cell with the cell  or cells, if we select  a number greater than two  above. When using this feature, you will notice  that other content shifts to the right of the table, poking out the end in an  extra column. This is because we still have the same number of cells in our  table, but one of them now spans two rows. Once we have used the Rows  spanned feature, we should usually delete the additional cells that have been  moved to the right of our table. We can remove row spanning by returning  the number of Rows spanned to 1. We can make life easy for ourselves by  selecting the cells that we would like to merge in Design view and selecting  Modify  Merge cells from the context menu. Columns spanned operates the same as Rows Spanned, but merges cells  horizontally rather than vertically.                 [ 45 ]   Adding Content and Tables        Header cell can be checked to give our cells the special th designation. This  means that our cells will be recognized as header information and will be  rendered appropriately. This feature is usually applied to the first row of a  table, as in the example we will see in a few moments. No wrap allows us to override the default, which automatically wraps the  text in our cell. When using the No wrap feature, it is recommended that   we add line breaks ourselves, so that the column does not become  ridiculously wide.  We are also able to specify the width or the height of a cell in the Cell Properties  dialog. This avoids the cell automatically resizing, depending on the content that is  added to it. Notice that when we do this, it will set the width of the whole column  and the height of the whole row, rather than just the width and height of our cell.  The width of cells in a column and the height of cells in a row cannot differ.  If we would like to change the properties of all the cells in a row in one go, we hover  our cursor over the left-hand border of the row we would like to edit until the cursor  changes to a right-hand arrow and then left-click. This will highlight the entire row.  Now, when we right-click and select Cell Properties… from the shortcut menu, any  changes we specify will apply to the entire row.  Let's use this technique to make the headings in the first row of our table stand out.  We are going to create header cells:  1.  Hover the cursor over the left-hand border of the first row in our table. 2.  Left-click so that the row is highlighted. 3.  Right-click on the highlighted area and select Cell Properties… from the   shortcut menu.  4.  Click in the Header cell checkbox so that it becomes checked. 5.  Click OK.  You will notice that when we did this, the contents of the first row became bold and  were centered. This is the default style for header cells.  [ 46 ]   Chapter 3  If we wished to edit all the cells in a column, we would use the same procedure, but  instead of clicking to the left of the row, we would click on the top of the column we  would like to change.  We can add or delete rows or columns at any time by right-clicking on a cell in the  table and selecting either Insert or Delete from the shortcut menu.  Layout Tables Tables are not only useful for displaying tabular data. They are also used on the  majority of websites to give the page some structure. By using invisible tables  content, creators  that's us  can divide their page up into distinct areas.  One of the most common ways in which this is done is to have a main cell for  the central content of the page with other smaller cells above and or beside it for  navigation buttons.  Usually, developers would create these tables themselves, but SharePoint Designer  has made this easier for us by providing us with a selection of layout tables to   choose from. To view the layout tables that are available to us, go to Task Panes  Layout Tables.  This adds the Layout Tables task pane to our designer. The most useful feature of  this task pane is at the bottom, where it lists pre-defined table layouts, which we can  use to structure our page.  [ 47 ]   Adding Content and Tables  Let's create a new page by going to File  New  ASPX, so we can experiment   with these layout tables. Clicking on the image of the layout table immediately   adds that table layout to our new page. To remove the layout table, click on the   No Layout image. Of the layout tables, the one I find to be the most useful is the one they call Corner,  Header, Left, and Body, which is the third layout table shown in the task pane. This  is a traditional page layout that allows us to have a logo in the top-left of the page,  a banner, or navigation at the top of the page, and more navigation down the left of  the page. If we also wanted to have some advertising space on our page, Header,  Left, Top Right, and Body might be a useful one to select. Besides using Layout Tables to structure our page, we can also add layout cells to  our page by clicking Insert Layout Cell…. This adds a table of one column and one  row  i.e. just one cell  to our page. We may wonder why someone would want such  a small table.  The idea is that it gives us greater control over the positioning and  formatting of the contents of that cell. One final point to note is that if you have a page size set  e.g. 760x420 , then you may  see a small dotted line running from left to right some way down the page. This is  "The Fold", which is an imaginary line showing the bottom of the page in the user's  browser. To see anything below this line, the users will need to scroll down the page.  Generally speaking, we would like to have the most important information on our  page above this line, so the user can see it at a glance. Divs versus Tables It is worth pointing out that there are many markup purists who consider it an  unforgivable sin to use tables for anything other than displaying tabular data. They  argue that using tables to structure our pages makes them less accessible, and that  we should use style elements such as div and span instead. In particular, the purists  would see the use of layout cells as a shocking crime against web standards. I won't comment on where I sit in this debate, but would like to warn that if you  decide to use only styles to lay out your page, there will be times when you find it  difficult to build and maintain more complex pages. Whatever your preference, you will find that SharePoint Designer is one of the most  standard-compliant development tools on the market. It does not force us to use  Layout Tables instead of CSS Layouts  note that the Layout Tables task pane is not  displayed by default, while the Manage Styles task pane is . SharePoint Designer  also makes CSS Layouts  which is notoriously difficult to do in a way that works  in all browsers  easier by providing us with Visual Aids to make it easier to see the  page elements. We can switch these aids on by selecting View  Visual Aids from  the menu. We are also provided with a CSS Layouts option as soon as we go to  create a new page in the File  New dialog. [ 48 ]   Chapter 3  Organizing Our Files During the few years I was in the army, the mantra "prior preparation and planning  prevents a pathetically poor performance" was bashed into my psyche. This is true  in other more sedentary walks of life, but especially in setting up a SharePoint site.  If you are involved in the administration of SharePoint sites as well as the design  of the sites, you will no doubt have noticed that SharePoint allows us to organize a  whole hierarchy of containers. We can have server farms, which have collections of  web applications within them, which, in turn, have site collections within those and  finally individual sites forming those site collections.  Fortunately, we are only dealing with one site at the moment. Even so, if you are a  tidy soul like me, then you will want to organize your files neatly within your site.  If you are not a naturally organized person, then this is a good chance to take your  first steps in that direction. In addition to ensuring that we give our files meaningful  names, we can do a lot to make our lives  and the lives of everyone else working on  our site  easier by arranging our pages neatly using the Web Site tab, the Folder List  task pane, and the Navigation task pane.  Publishing Our Site So far, we have been working on our site "locally"  i.e. on our own computer . Let's  go ahead and publish our site, so that other users on our network can view it.  1.  Go to File  Publish Site. 2.  Select the FrontPage Server Extensions or SharePoint Services option. 3.  Type the address of the site you would like to create in the Remote Web site  location field. I am going to use http:  olmec hello. Note that I chose an  address without a space in it.  4.  Click OK.  We will see the following two dialogs once we have done this, because we are  creating a new site.  The first dialog asks us whether we would like to create a website at our selected  location, if it has not been done so.  [ 49 ]   Adding Content and Tables  The next dialog warns us that publishing our site in this manner  as opposed to  working on the remote files directly  has limitations in the functionality that we can  use. We have not added any SharePoint content yet, so can simply click the   OK button.  Once we are past the warning dialog, our Web Site pane opens in the Remote Web  Site view, which was previously empty. If you have used a File Transfer Protocol   FTP  program to upload files to a website before this, screen will look most familiar:  [ 50 ]   Chapter 3  Notice that the icon for our default.aspx file is a cute little house. This is because  the name "default.aspx" is the one that automatically displays as our homepage  when someone visits our website. To publish our site, we merely need to click the Publish Web site button. Our files  are then copied onto the SharePoint server.  Viewing Our Page Users will now be able to see our creation live on the network by typing the URL of  our page into their browser's address bar.  [ 51 ]   Adding Content and Tables  The address of our site is composed of the following four elements:        Protocol name. The site will usually use the hypertext transfer protocol   HTTP  and so will be http:  , but at times it will be its encrypted relative,  which is https:  . Server address will vary depending on where the user is viewing the   site from:        Server Name. I will be using the example address   http:  olmec  for the rest of this book, because Olmec is the  name of the SharePoint server we have in our server farm. If  we are browsing the site using a browser on the SharePoint  server itself, then we can also use http:  localhost  to  view our site. Domain Name. If your network administrator has set up  your SharePoint Site, IIS  Internet Information Server , and  any firewalls correctly, then the site can be viewed by users  outside your network. The domain name that the Wine  Company uses is www.winecompany.co.uk  take a look and  you will see the example site that we will be building in this  book . Notice that the network administrator usually sets up  this domain name to point to the site without the need for the  user to type in any other items, such as folder or page names,  in the address. Often subdomains will be used to point to  different SharePoint sites  e.g. forum.winecompany.co.uk or  survey.winecompany.co.uk .        Site name e.g. hello. The default name of the site that SharePoint creates on  your behalf is Pages. Page name e.g. pagename.aspx. If we would like our page to be the first to  display in a site, then the name default.aspx should be used.  [ 52 ]   Authorization In order for users to be able to view our new site in their browser, they will need to  have the correct permissions applied within SharePoint. If this has not been done,  then they will see a message like the following one displayed in their browser:  Chapter 3  Editing Existing Sites It is possible to edit existing sites on our SharePoint server  although, of course, I  would urge you to be careful, if you are unsure about what you are doing to those  pages . To open a site, follow this procedure:  1.  Close any sites you have opened in your designer using File  Close Site. 2.  File  Open Site. 3.  Click on the site you would like to open  e.g. http:  olmec mysite . 4.  Click Open. 5.  Enter your username and password into the login dialog.  If we are working with multiple sites, we will also find File  Recent Sites useful,  because it gives us fast access to open sites that we have been working on recently.  [ 53 ]   Adding Content and Tables  Summary In this chapter, we learned how to create a new site and to add pages to that site. We  then moved on to add text and graphics to our page and learned how to preview the  site in our web browser.  We also looked at how to create tables and learned about the benefits of layout tables  and were made aware that there is much debate about using div, wherever possible,  in order to make our pages as accessible as possible.  Finally, we looked at organizing our files and publishing our site.  We are now equipped to create new pages, to add basic content to those pages, and  to publish our pages to the SharePoint server.  All good stuff, but I am sure you will agree that our page lacks visual oomph. Let's  carry on and learn about the methods we can use to create a consistent style for our  site. In the following chapter, we will learn to format our pages using Cascading  Style Sheets. We will also learn about Master Pages and how to edit them to give our  site a consistent appearance.  [ 54 ]   Formatting Pages  Now that we have added the most basic content to our site, we will take a more   in-depth look at using features, such as Cascading Style Sheets and Master Pages, to  format our pages in a consistent and scalable fashion.  The Wine Company Website Before creating any site, it is a good idea to thoroughly consider which pages the  site will contain. Tony and Gavin at the Wine Company have decided that their new  SharePoint site will have the following navigation buttons on each of the pages of   the site:           Red Wine White Wine Contact Search       Register Log-In  They have deliberately kept the number of links as low as possible, so that visitors  to the site are steered towards the most important pages  i.e. the ones selling wine .  Tony also suggested to Gavin that they design the menu in a way that allows more  buttons to be quickly added if required  he knows from experience that Gavin is  liable to ask for new features to be added to their site, often at very short notice .  The Wine Company site will also have a couple of links that will allow users to  access password-protected information within the site:  In addition to this, the site will have a search box that will be visible on every page   thereby providing customers with yet another avenue to find their favorite tipple .   Formatting Pages  Creating Our Site Creating their site will be a useful way of recapping on the skills we learned in the  previous chapter.   We will create the foundation for the site in three stages:  1.  Create a new site on our computer. 2.  Add a homepage to this site. 3.  Publish the site to our SharePoint server.  Creating a New Site The first thing that we are going to do is create a new SharePoint site, which we will  call "WINEC". We will be using this site for the rest of the exercises in this book.  Start by creating the site on your computer:  1.  Click File  New  Web Site…. 2.  Select Empty Web Site from the list of possible pages. 3.  Create a new folder within the My Web Sites folder for your site and name   the new folder WINEC  e.g. C:\Users\ \Documents\My Web  Sites\WINEC .  4.  Click OK.  SharePoint Designer will then display the Folder view for our new empty site on   the screen.  [ 56 ]   Chapter 4  Creating Our Homepage Let's add a new blank page to our site. Add the new page by selecting   File  New  ASPX.  The first thing we will do with this page is save it as default.aspx, so that it will be  used automatically as the homepage on our site.  1.  Select File  Save. 2.  Leave the default location as C:\Users\ \Documents\My Web   Sites\WINEC.  3.  Change the File name to default. 4.  Save as type ASPX Files. 5.  Click Change title… and type Wine Company and press OK. 6.  Click Save.  When we click on the Web Site tab in the designer, we will see that our new page  has been added to the website and that it has been given a cute little house icon to  signify that this is our homepage.  Clicking on default.aspx returns us to the Design view of our homepage. Type the  following text inside the formform1 container on the page:  Welcome to the Wine Company  The Wine Company is a fictitious company which supplies wines from all over  the world to our UK customers.  We will save the page with File  Save.  [ 57 ]   Formatting Pages  Publishing Our Site Now that we have created our homepage, we can publish our site on the   SharePoint server.  1.  Go to File  Publish Site…. 2.  Select the FrontPage Server Extensions or SharePoint Services option. 3.  Type the address of our new site in the Remote Web site location: field as   http:  olmec winec.  4.  Click OK. 5.  When asked if you would like to create this new website, click Yes. 6.  Click OK on the next information dialog. 7.  This time we want to download the default files and folders, which   SharePoint server created in our site for us, as well as uploading our site.   To do this, click on the Synchronize radio button in the bottom-right of   the screen.  8.  Click Publish Web site. 9.  You will almost certainly see a further information dialog such as one that  tells you that certain components require a server running WSS to function   e.g. _catalogs masterpage default.master . Click Ignore and Continue. We will now be able to browse to our site from anywhere on the network by typing  the address of our site  e.g. http:  olmec winec  .  Formatting Our Homepage Now that we have our page ready, we can jazz it up a little by applying some  formatting. We can access the formatting features in two ways. Most obviously, we can use the buttons on the Common button bar, which is  displayed at the top of the designer.  [ 58 ]   Chapter 4  There is also a Formatting button bar, which can be used instead of the  Common button bar, but there is little point in using it because it only  includes three commands that are not available on the Common button  bar  Manage Styles, Increase Font Size, and Decrease Font Size . These  three commands can be added to the Common command bar by clicking  the Toolbar Options button and choosing Add or Remove Buttons.  Let's turn our first line of text into a heading by highlighting it and selecting Heading  1   from the Styles drop-down  the one that currently says  None   on the  Common button bar. Notice that as the text changes to become a large heading, a fine blue dotted border  appears around the text with a small h1 tab on it. This blue line denotes the area that  the style applies to and will not display on the web page at run time. If you wish,  then visual aids such as this can be turned off by going to View  Visual Aids.  Also notice that our second sentence was pushed further down the page. This is  because by default an h1 tag adds an extra line break after it. Personally, I dislike this  behavior and remove these line breaks from the h1 style as soon as I possibly can  we  will see how to do this shortly .  The Wine Company uses a deep red color in its marketing materials. This color has  red, green, blue  RGB  values of 153, 0, and 51 respectively. Although web browsers  can understand decimal RGB values, it is more common for them to use hexadecimal  values. In hexadecimal, this color becomes 990033.  We can color the second sentence on our page this deep red color by highlighting  the sentence and clicking the small black drop-down arrow to the right of the Font  Color icon on the Common button bar. This gives us a short menu of standard  fairly  garish  colors we can use. Clicking on More Colors... gives us a nicer selection of  colors. Let's click on the Wine Company's standard burgundy color, which is near  the bottom-right of the color picker.   [ 59 ]   Formatting Pages  We know we have the correct color when the Value: field displays Hex={99,00,33}.  Clicking OK applies this color to our text.  The Format menu provides us with more in-depth formatting tools. Of particular  significance for the moment are the items in the second section of this menu. I will  not insult your intelligence by going into minute detail about how to use this to  make your text bold, etc., but there are a few items of interest that are different from  the other programs in the Office suite:     Font automatically defaults to Times New Roman, but the interesting thing  here is that our text can be given more than one font. The reason for this  is that for a font to display within the user's browser, it must be installed  on their computer. If the font is not installed on their computer, then their  browser will use their default font  which is usually Times New Roman .  To help ensure that our page displays in a manner which is consistent, we  can select the combination of fonts that we would like our page to try to  use. As an example, our page can use Arial, if it is installed on the user's  PC, otherwise it will use Helvetica, and if it also does not have that, it will  use sans-serif. Because all three fonts look vaguely similar, our page should  appear roughly in the way we intend it to, irrespective of who is viewing  it. It is also possible to select Blink in this font dialog to make our text blink  incessantly, but the good news is that it will only blink in browsers such as  Firefox and will not blink in Internet Explorer 7.  [ 60 ]   Chapter 4                    The Paragraph dialog is very straightforward, especially because it provides  us with a helpful preview, at the bottom of the dialog, of what each of the  features does when we select them. All that should be pointed out is that the  items in the Line spacing: drop-down need to be selected a few times before  the preview updates to display what our paragraph will look like. Bullets and Numbering is equally simple to use. My personal favorite use  of this is to specify a square 18 pixel graphic of an arrow, which I use as the  bullet for many of my lists. Borders and Shading is the dream dialog for lovers of divs. This is to purists  what Table  Table Properties  Table… is to content creators who prefer  to use tables. This Borders and Shading dialog provides massive amounts  of control, allowing the size, margins, border, and colors of the section of the  page you are editing to be changed in minute detail. Position is grayed out on our screen at the moment because the text we   have selected is not positionable. Do not fear though, we will return to this in  a moment. Behaviors are JavaScript events that are triggered when a user interacts   with an element on our page. They would not be the first thing we would  think of when someone mentions formatting. It is included in this menu  because behaviors can be applied to span tags  i.e. the HTML tag to which  our style relates .  Layers. Ahh yes, Layers. Well, they deserve further explanation.  Using Layers Everything seems to have layers. Onions have layers, people have layers, and even  donkeys have layers  according to Donkey in "Shrek", Dreamworks 2001 . Web pages  are no exception. We can add layers to our page to build it up in three dimensions.  Content can be placed to overlap other content on our page.  We will take a moment to add a new layer to our page, which we will use to display  a special offer of a fabulous revolutionary  pardon the pun  new corkscrew that  customers get for free with any case of wine. By using layers to do this, we can position  the special offer exactly where we would like it to appear on our page. Not only that,  but using layers also allows us to display or hide the content whenever we wish.  1.  Select Format  Layers. 2.  This will display the Layers task pane. 3.  Click on the Insert Layer icon in the Layers task pane.  [ 61 ]   Formatting Pages  You will notice that two things happened when we did this. First of all, a new layer  called layer1 was added to our empty list of layers in the Layers task pane, and  secondly, a new layer with the heading divlayer1 was placed on our page where  our cursor had been.  As you know already, I am an organized kind of chap. I don't have labels on the  shelves in my wardrobe at home with the words "socks" and "pants" on them, but I  am not far off. In this spirit of being organized, the first thing we are going to do to  our new layer is give it a more meaningful name:  1.  Double-click on the word layer1 in our Layers task pane so that the text   becomes highlighted.  2.  Type specialOffer and press Enter.  Now that our nicely named layer is on the page, let's change the properties to make  it a decent size and position it ready to contain our special offer:  1.  Select the specialOffer layer. 2.  Go to Format  Position..., which will open up the Position dialog. 3.  Set the size to a Width of 175px and a Height of 300px. 4.  Set the location to be in from the Right by 5px and down from the Top   by 5px  leave the Positioning style set to Absolute so that this position is  measured from the edge of the page rather than being relative to where our  cursor is on the page .  5.  Click OK.  [ 62 ]   This will place our specialOffer layer snugly in the top right-hand corner of our web  page. Go ahead and type the following two sentences into the layer:  Free Corkscrew For a limited time the Wine Company are giving away the revolutionary new  WundaWinder corkscrew free with every case of wine.  Chapter 4  We would like to format the background and borders of the new layer to help it  stand out from the page and catch the eye of visitors to the site:  1.  Hover the cursor over the border of the layer  the multi-headed arrow cursor   will appear  and left-click to select the entire layer.  2.  Go to Format  Borders and Shading.... 3.  Notice that the Setting for the border is set to Default. 4.  Select solid from the Style list  notice that this will change the Setting    to Box .  5.  Click on the Color drop-down list and select More Colors.... 6.  Select the gold color with the value Hex={CC,99,00} from near the bottom-left   corner of the color picker.  7.  Click OK. 8.  Click the Shading tab. 9.  Click on the Background color: drop-down list. You will notice that the   deep red and the gold colors that we are using on our page have been made  available for us in a new Document Colors: section. Click on our deep red.  10.  Click OK.  [ 63 ]   Formatting Pages  We have now successfully colored our layer. If it looks purple instead of red in  your Design view, this will be because you still have it highlighted. Go ahead and  preview the page in your browser  File  Preview in Browser . Notice how our  layer stays nicely in the right corner of our page, irrespective of the width we resize  our browser window to. As we make our browser thinner, we see that the layer  covers the other text on our page. This means that care will need to be taken when  designing our page to ensure that we are not obscuring important page content with  our specialOffer layer. We can certainly make our special offer feature more appealing. Let's start by  changing the text. We are going to make the font a sans-serif font and color it white.  We will also add some padding around the text and make the first sentence bold:  1.  Highlight all the text that is on our layer. 2.  Select Format  Font.... 3.  Change the Font face to Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif. 4.  Click on the Color drop-down and select White from the Standard Colors. 5.  Click OK. 6.  Select Format  Paragraph.... 7.  Change the Indentation of both the Left side and the Right side to 10px. 8.  Click OK. 9.  Highlight the first sentence of our special offers text  i.e. Free Corkscrew . 10.  Select Format  Font once again. 11.  Change the Font style to Bold. 12.  Click OK.  Adding an Image to Our Layer We are going to jazz up our feature slightly more by adding a photo, which we  created  wundawinderBackground.jpg , as a background on our layer:  1.  Open the Layers task pane. 2.  Right-click on specialOffer. 3.  Select Borders and Shading. 4.  Click the Shading tab.  [ 64 ]   5.  Click on the Browse… button and browse your hard drive for the image we   will use as the background picture.  6.  Once you have located the correct image, click it once and then select Open. 7.  Click OK.  We will see the image embedded into the background of our layer.  Chapter 4  Publishing Images When building SharePoint sites, it is vital that we understand which files are in  which locations. There are three different types of location that our files can reside in:           Source Files. This can be anywhere on our PC, network, or removable  media such as CD, DVD, Memory stick, or digital camera. Currently the  wundawinderBackground.jpg image only exists in the location that you  copied the source files for this book to. Local Web Site. If you take a look in the WINEC folder inside My Web Sites on  your computer, you will notice that the images folder is empty. This is the  local folder that stores the images used by our website. SharePoint Server. When we publish our local website to the server, it will  upload a copy of the images so they can be seen by visitors to our site.  [ 65 ]   Formatting Pages  SharePoint Designer will prompt us to ensure that our images are copied to the  correct locations. Go ahead and save the page that we embedded our image in. When  we do this, SharePoint Designer prompts us to save the source images to our local  website so that they will be there to display at run time.  The reason that I like this dialog so much is that it does not just prompt us to   upload the images that the site needs, but it also allows us to optimize and organize  our images.  When we are creating large sites, we want to organize our files in a system of   sub-folders. There is nothing worse than having to scroll through hundreds of web  pages, images, and style sheets, which have all been saved in the root of the website. Specify the folder that we would like our image to be placed in by clicking the Change  Folder... button and browsing into the images folder in the view of our website that  we are presented with. Once in the images folder, click on the Create New Folder icon  and name the new folder specialOffers. Click OK to finish this procedure. We can also optimize our image by clicking on the Picture File Type... button. This  is particularly useful if our source image has a larger than necessary file size, such  as a PNG image or a high quality JPEG. In our case, the image that I created for the  specialOffer should be pretty optimal so would not benefit from any tinkering. Once SharePoint Designer has made a copy of our embedded image in our local  website, it will be visible when we go to File  Preview in Browser. For the image   to be visible in our published website, we will need to synchronise with our   remote website.  [ 66 ]   Renaming Our Styles If we peek into our Manage Styles task pane, we can see the styles we have created  on our page:  Chapter 4  When we click on one of our styles, we see a handy preview of what that style looks  like displayed in the preview pane at the foot of the task pane.  As you will no doubt have guessed, I would like to tidy this up a little by giving  our styles names that are more meaningful. Right-click on each style in turn and  select the Rename class option. We will rename our styles to be called redText,  specialOfferBox, and specialOfferText. When doing so, ensure that the Rename  class references in this page check box remains checked to ensure that the class  names in our code update as well as the names in our Manage Styles pane.  Cascading Style Sheets Formatting our page directly by using the formatting tools is all very well, but in  larger sites or sites that are maintained by more than one person, it can be difficult  to maintain a consistent look and feel of all the pages in the site. This is where  Cascading Style Sheets  CSS  comes in. It allows us to define the styles we will use in  one central place and then to apply those styles to the elements on our pages.  Working with Styles in SharePoint Designer involves three separate task panes:         CSS Properties Manage Styles Apply Styles  When formatting our page, the style information was stored within the head section  of the HTML of the page. A far better way to store our styles is to have them in one  central style sheet so that we can use our styles on any page of our site.  [ 67 ]   Formatting Pages  To centralize our styles, we create a style sheet where the styles will be specified. We  will do this now by going to File  New  CSS. The first thing we are going to do is save this empty style sheet to the root of our site:  1.  Go File  Save. 2.  Change the File name to winec.  Now that we have our blank CSS, we can move into the Code view of default.aspx  and cut the following style code from it:  border-style: solid; border-color: CC9900; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: FFFFFF; background-color: 990033; background-image: url 'images specialOffers wundawinderBackground.  color: 990033;    .redText {   } .specialOfferBox {             jpg' ;  } .specialOfferText {     }    margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;  Paste all of this code apart from the opening and closing style tags  <style  type="text css"> and    into winec.css. If we now save winec.css and default.aspx and return to the Design view of  default.aspx, we will see that default.aspx has lost its formatting  because we cut it  from the code . No matter, we can reunite it with these lost styles by clicking Attach  Style Sheet from the Manage Styles task pane and browsing for winec.css. When  we click the OK button, all is well once again. Our styles are now being applied from  the centralized style sheet. Notice how our styles are now listed in the winec.css  category in the task pane rather than in the Current Page category, where they   were previously.  [ 68 ]   We will need to use Attach Style Sheet to attach the style sheet to any of the pages  that we would like that style sheet to apply to. We will shortly learn about Master  Pages. For now, it is good to be aware that attaching the style sheet to a Master Page  will ensure that our styles are available to all pages that use that Master Page.  Chapter 4  Editing Styles I promised earlier in the chapter that we would remove the automatic line   break from the end of our h1 tags. In formatting speak, this is known as using an  inline style. To do this, we could simply add the following line of code to winec.css:  H1 {display: inline}  Doing so would not really teach you to use SharePoint Designer though, so let's do it  the menu-driven way.  1.  Click on New Style in the Manage Styles task pane. 2.  Select h1 in the Selector drop-down. 3.  Change the Define in drop-down to Existing style sheet so that the style   applies to all pages on our site that use the winec.css style sheet.  4.  Ensure that the URL is set to winec.css. 5.  Click on the Layout category. 6.  Change display to inline. 7.  Click OK.  [ 69 ]   Formatting Pages  When working with style sheets, it is helpful to know that when the name  of the style begins with a dot, it is referring to a class; when there is no  dot, it is referring to an HTML tag  as in the example above ; and when it  starts with a , it is referring to an ID.  Now when we flick to default.aspx, notice that the extra line break at the end of  our heading has been removed. Also notice that h1 has appeared in our list of styles  listed for winec.css in our Manage Styles task pane and that the icon beside the style  is blue  denoting it as a known style rather than a custom style we have created .  A word of warning while on the subject of styles: If you do need to copy text from  Microsoft Word into SharePoint Designer, be aware that you will also be importing  the styles that Word has used to mark up your document. SharePoint Designer  makes it easy for us to remove these styles. Simply paste the content into the Design  view and then select the Remove Formatting smart tag.  If you would like to learn more about writing cascading style sheets, then you may  find that http:  www.w3.org Style CSS  is a useful resource.  Master Pages We could just bash ahead and build our first page using the formatting techniques  that we have just learned. This is the way that sites were traditionally built. One page  was created and once all involved were happy that it looked OK, it was copied many  times to create the basis for all the other pages in the site.  We could do it that way too, but let's wait a moment. What happens when six  months down the line we would like to add a new navigation button to the menu  that appears on every page? Do we need to change all the pages on our site  individually? The clever developers  and I humbly place myself in that category   used Server Side Includes to create the page elements  e.g. the menu bar  in  one place, which then propagated throughout their site. They could place some  additional code into the include and "hey presto" the new button appeared on every  page of their site.  By introducing Master Pages, Microsoft allows us to achieve the same results  without the need to learn about Server Side Includes. Master Pages are an ASP.NET  2.0 feature that allows us to give all the pages in our site a consistent look and layout.  They are templates that we build and attach to content pages to create the web pages  within our site.  Master Pages use Content Placeholders to indicate regions of replaceable content.  When we update the information on the Master Page, this automatically updates the  content on our content pages.  [ 70 ]   Where Are Our Master Pages Stored? If we take a look in our Folder List task pane, we will see the _catalogs masterpage   folder tree, which was copied on our local version of the WINEC site when we first  synchronized our site. This location is referred to as the "Master Page Gallery" and  contains some default forms and a file called default.master, which is our Default  Master Page.  Chapter 4  Creating a Master Page We will now create the Master Page that we will use throughout our site by doing  the following:  1.  Select File  New  Page. 2.  Select Master Page.  It is as simple as that. A new Master Page has been created for us. We want to start  from a totally clean slate so delete ContentPlaceHolder1 from the page.   Editing Our Master Page Now that we have our blank Master Page, we will give it some structure by using  the layout tables provided for us. Open the Layout Tables task pane and click on the  third layout  the one with the title Corner, Header, Left, and Body . This will add a  blue layout grid to our new Master Page. This layout stretches the full width of the  browser window with a 120 pixel tall row at the top of the page and a 191 pixel wide  column down the left-hand side.  [ 71 ]   Formatting Pages  If we flip into the Code view, we can see that SharePoint Designer has automatically  designated different CellTypes to the four cells in our layout:      &nbsp;      &nbsp;   <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="width:  1104px; height: 882px">                                                                            &nbsp;      &nbsp;   This is rather spooky because Microsoft's plan for our page seems to be exactly the  same as ours. We will use each of the four cells on our page for the   following purpose:             DecArea in the top-left will be where we place our company logo. ContentHead stretching across the top of our page is where we may wish to  place banner adverts in future. NavBody down the left side of the page will contain our site   navigation buttons. ContentBody in the center of the page will contain the content that our   page has.  The first thing that we are going to do is add the deep red color as a background to  the two top cells and the left-hand column. This will allow us to see changes to our  content page when we apply our Master Page to it. We will start with the top-left cell:  1.  Right-click inside the top-left cell. 2.  Select Cell Properties… from the shortcut menu. 3.  Click on the Background Color drop-down and select More Colors....  [ 72 ]   Chapter 4  4.  Click on our 990033 color. 5.  Click OK. 6.  Click Apply.  Now repeat this process for the top-right cell and the left column. If we peek into the Manage Styles task pane, we will see that the red background  has been created as a new style called style1. Not only is this untidy and  unimaginative but it is likely to cause problems if there is also a style called style1  in one of our content pages. Before we go any further, let's rename style1 to  navigationBackground.  Adding a Content Region We must now specify the part of the Master Page where we would like our content  to appear. We do this by adding a Content Region:  1.  Right-click anywhere in the bottom-right cell  i.e. the large one with the   white background  of our Master Page.  2.  Select Manage Microsoft ASP.NET Content Regions…. 3.  The dialog that appears should only contain one Content Region called head. 4.  Type the name MainContent into the Region name field. 5.  Click Add. 6.  Click Close.  This has added a new Content Placeholder called MainContent into the main cell of  the layout table on our Master Page.  [ 73 ]   Formatting Pages  Saving Our Master Page Now that we have a Content Region in our Master Page, we can go ahead and save  the page. It is possible to save a Master Page that does not contain any Content  Regions but there is little point because you will not be able to use it for anything.  1.  Go to File  Save. 2.  Browse into the _catalogs folder and then into the masterpage folder. 3.  Give your file the name winec. 4.  Click Save.  Attaching Our Master Page to an Existing  Page We can now go ahead and use our new Master Page as the template for our  homepage layout. Microsoft refers to this as attaching the Master Page.  1.  Open default.aspx in the designer. 2.  Go to Format  Master Page  Attach Master Page…. 3.  Browse into _catalogs then masterpage. 4.  Click on the winec.master file. 5.  Click Open. 6.  Click OK. 7.   In the Match Content Regions dialog, click OK to use SharePoint Designer's  suggestions for mapping the content regions between the two pages.  Creating a New Page Using a Master Page Once we have established our Master Page, the easiest way to create new content  pages is to create them directly from the Master Page.  1.  Go File  New  Create from Master Page…. 2.  Click Browse. 3.  Browse into _catalogs then masterpage. 4.  Click on winec.master. 5.  Click Open. 6.  Click OK.  [ 74 ]   This will create a new page based on our Master Page called Untitled_1.aspx.  Chapter 4  Notice that the title of our MainContent Placeholder has the word Master in  parenthesis after it. This signifies that the Content Placeholder will display whatever  the Placeholder in our Master Page displays. In order to add our custom content to  this new page, we need to change the Content Placeholder to allow custom content.  We can switch to using custom content by clicking on the right-hand arrow button at  the right-hand end of the Content Placeholder and selecting Create Custom Content.  Once this has been clicked, the title changes to Custom and we can edit our content  as we wish.  Go ahead and replace the text in the Placeholder with the following:  Contact the Wine Company  Let's save our new page as contact.aspx. Take a look into the Code view for our new page and you will see that the code is  remarkably compact.   <%@ Page masterpagefile="_catalogs masterpage winec.master"  language="C" title="Contact the Wine Company" %> <asp:Content id="Content1" runat="server" contentplaceholderid="MainC ontent">       Contact the Wine Company   [ 75 ]   Formatting Pages  Notice three things in this code:  1.  The first line of the code is a reference to the Master Page that our content   page uses..  2.  There is no need for any table code   ,  ,    because that is all   controlled by the Master Page..  3.  Our page has handily used our content as the title for our page. No more  Untitled Document text appearing in the browser's title bar by default..  Modifying the Master Page Let's return to our Master Page and pretty it up a little by adding the company logo  into the top left-hand corner of the page.  1.  Insert  Picture  From File.... 2.  Browse to redlogo.191.jpg and select it. 3.  Click Insert. 4.  Specify Wine Company as the Alternate Text. 5.  Click OK. 6.  File  Save. 7.   In the Save Embedded Files dialog, click Change Folder… and save the logo  to a new folder called nav.  8.  Click OK to close the Save Embedded Files dialog.  When we open our contact.aspx page in the Designer, we will notice a small red  cross signifying a missing image where the logo should be.  [ 76 ]   Chapter 4  When we saved our Master Page, the content page automatically updated to contain  our logo but unfortunately the content page is looking in the wrong folder for the  logo. The reason it cannot find the folder is that the content page is in the root of our  site but the master page is a few folders higher up the directory tree. The problem   is one of relative locations. Here are the relative paths required for each page to find  the logo:       Master Page—.. .. images nav redlogo.191.jpg Content Page—images nav redlogo.191.jpg  At the moment, the Master Page is telling our content page to use the first of these  locations. So what to do?  One solution that would mean that the icon would display correctly in both  pages would be to programmatically specify the file location using Server. MapPath "images nav redlogo.191.jpg" , but unfortunately code blocks are not  permitted in Master Pages so we cannot use that method.  At the end of the day, it is the content page that is important because that is the one  the visitor to the site will see. To solve the problem, go into the Code view of our  Master Page and remove the two extra directory levels from .. .. images nav  redlogo.191.jpg by removing the leading .. .. . Once we have saved winec. master, we will see that our logo appears correctly on our content page  and any  other content pages we create at the same directory level .  Attaching Our StyleSheet to Our Master Page The final thing that we will do is attach our style sheet to our Master Page, in order  to maintain a uniform style across our site:  1.  Open winec.master  it is inside the _catalogs masterpage  folder  in   Design view.  2.  Click on Attach Style Sheet… in the Manage Styles task pane. 3.  Click Browse on the Attach Style Sheet dialog. 4.  Select winec.css. 5.  Click Open. 6.  Click OK. 7.  Select File  Save to save the changes to winec.master.  [ 77 ]   Formatting Pages  Notice that our Manage Styles task pane has now been populated with the styles  within winec.css:  Summary We are now equipped to create new pages that follow a consistent theme. Even  better than that, we can allow other users to contribute towards our site while still  keeping our styles protected.  Read the following chapter to learn more about the tools SharePoint provides to  allow contributors to publish their content.  [ 78 ]   Collaborating with Other  Contributors  In this chapter, we are going to digress ever so slightly and learn about the   great collaboration features that set SharePoint apart from other web   development solutions.  First of all, we will examine Contributor mode, which allows us to define the changes  individual solution creators can make to the site.  We will then take a look at the Workflow features that are built into SharePoint   and that enable our site to automatically trigger specified actions when associated  conditions occur.  Contributor Mode In developing the Wine Company website, Tony may wish to use Contributor mode  to limit Gavin's level of participation. This would be a good idea because it would  prevent the less technically savvy staff member from inadvertently breaking the site.  By using SharePoint's Contributor mode, Gavin may be restricted in what he can  do on the site. For example, he may be limited to only adding and editing pages, or  adding and editing Web Parts. SharePoint Designer would ensure that he cannot  alter the general layout of the site or perform other specified detrimental activities,  such as adding huge images to the site.  It can often be difficult to decide which abilities to grant to users. When specifying  the different abilities for the staff who will be maintaining our site, we should follow  the 'principle of least privilege'. That is to say we give them as little access as possible  but as much as they require in order to accomplish their tasks.   Collaborating with Other Contributors  Server-Based Sites versus Disk-Based  Sites In our previous examples, we created our website locally and then published it to the  SharePoint server so it could be viewed. This "disk-based" approach is a good way for  an individual to develop a site  at least, in doing so, we are inadvertently creating a  backup of our site  but is unsuitable if other users would like to contribute to our site.  If we were to try to enable collaboration on our Wine Company site, we would get  the following message:  If collaboration is to be used by one of our sites, then the site must be based on the  SharePoint server rather than on our personal computer.  Let's instruct our SharePoint server to set up a new server-based site for us:  1.  Click File  New  Web Site…. 2.  Select Empty Web Site from the list of possible pages. 3.  This time we are going to set the location on our SharePoint server. Type   http:    share  as the location of the new site  where    is the name of our SharePoint Server .  4.  Click OK.  Now go ahead and create a new default.aspx page in the root of our new site.  The first thing to notice is that when we browse to http:    share   using our favorite web browser, the page appears  albeit without any content  because we have not done that yet . This happened without the need for us to enter  the Remote Web site view and publish our site. Easy, huh? Even if we are not going to collaborate with other users on the development of our  site, there are very few reasons why we should not use this server-based approach  rather than the disk-based approach. These reasons for sticking with the disk-based  approach may include:  [ 80 ]   Chapter 5        Uncertainty that we will always be able to access our files on the   remote server. A desire to use the preview feature on our own computer to check we   are happy with changes we have made before we publish them to the  SharePoint server.  Enabling Contributor Settings Now that we have our server-based site, we can go ahead and set the contributor  settings. Start by opening the Contributor task pane.  You will notice that the task pane tells us that we have unrestricted contributor  status. This status allows us to specify the contributor settings for our site,  controlling which users can modify the different parts of our site.  [ 81 ]   Collaborating with Other Contributors  Click on the Modify Contributor Settings for this site… link to bring up the  Contributor Settings dialog. Here, we see that there are two categories we   can manage:       Manage Contributor Groups Manage Region Types  Let's look at both of these in more detail.  Contributor Groups We can add the users in our organization to contributor groups, depending on  the function that we would like those users to perform. We can set up as many  contributor groups as we like. Each of the contributor groups can be set to use one of  SharePoint's built-in permission levels.  [ 82 ]   Chapter 5  By default, there are three contributor groups, each of which maps to a SharePoint  permission level:           Content Authors have the Contribute permission level that allows them to  make changes in Design view. They can create new content pages and edit  content in existing regions. Web Designers have the Design permission level, allowing them to make  changes in both Design and Code view. They have unrestricted use of  SharePoint Designer, including the ability to change the regions that are laid  out on a page. The Site Manager has the Full Control permission level. This speaks for  itself. They have the same unrestricted use as Designers.  If a user, who opens the site in SharePoint designer, is not assigned to one of the  contributor groups, they will automatically be assigned to the group that is specified  as the default group. For this reason, it is usual that the default contributor group is  the one with the lowest set of permissions  e.g. the Content Authors .  Region Types You will remember from the previous chapter that master pages contain content  placeholders and that these placeholders in turn contain content regions.  Using the contribution feature, we can assign different region types to our content  regions. In this way, we can specify the types of content that can be added to specific  content regions. For example, we could assign the default Text only region type  to a content region on our homepage that we have set up to display the name of  the winner of our previous month's competition. The solution creator, who is just  allowed to add text to the page, would be able to add the winner's name, but if they  try to add a picture of the winner as well they would not be permitted to.  For each region type, we have a huge degree of control and can specify editing  restrictions within four categories:           Editing Formatting Images SharePoint  [ 83 ]   Collaborating with Other Contributors  To see an example of one of these restrictions, click on the Modify… button within  the Manage Region Types section in the Contributor Settings dialog and then click  on the Images category on the left-hand side of the Region Settings dialog.  In this dialog, you will notice that it is not only possible to specify if this region type  allows images to be added but it also allows much greater control. The example that  I like the most is that you can specify the maximum file size of an image that can be  added to a region. By using this feature, a site manager can prevent their staff from  adding images that would take too long to download  as might be the case if Gavin  were to be allowed free reign . Before leaving the Contributor Settings dialog, we should also examine what is  behind the Advanced button. The contact email address, which can be specified  there, is an important feature. It provides users with a link in their Contributor task  pane, which they can use to send an email, requesting changes to the Contributor  Settings so they can perform tasks that they require.  [ 84 ]   Chapter 5  Setting Up Contribution on Our Master  Page Let's go ahead and put some of these features into practice. The first thing that we  will do is create a new master page, to which we can add our content placeholders:  1.  Go to File  New  Page. 2.  Click on Master Page. 3.  Click OK. 4.  File  Save As. 5.  Browse into the _catalogs masterpage  folders. 6.  Specify the File name as share. 7.  Save. 8.  When SharePoint prompts you to include a SharePoint Web Part Manager to   the master page, click Yes.  9.  When SharePoint prompts you to include a SharePoint Robots Meta Tag   control to the master page, click Yes.  SharePoint has already created a content placeholder called ContentPlaceHolder1  for us on our new master page. Go ahead and rename this placeholder to  textExample  we can do this by opening the Tag Properties task pane and changing  the ID or by clicking on Manage Microsoft ASP.NET Content Regions . To assign a region type to our new content region, we right-click on the placeholder  and select Manage Microsoft ASP.NET Content Regions… from the shortcut menu.  [ 85 ]   Collaborating with Other Contributors  This brings up the following dialog. All we need to do is assign a region type  we  will choose Text Only  to our region by selecting it from the Region type list and  then click the Close button.  Notice how the region type that we chose appears in parentheses beside our  placeholder name in the Design view:  Once we save our Master page, contributors will only be permitted to add text items  into that placeholder. If they try to add images, they will be notified that they are not  permitted to do so.  The Contributor's Experience When working on a SharePoint site in Contributor mode, a restricted user will  notice that only some of the features that would otherwise be available to them are  functional. Users are able to view the permissions that are available to them   by clicking on the View your Contributor Settings… link in their Contributor   task pane.  [ 86 ]   Chapter 5  One common way of using Contributor mode is to restrict most Contributor groups  by only allowing them to create new pages from a specified master page. If the user  tries to create a page in a different manner, they will be unable to and will be notified  with the message "Your current Contributor Settings prevent you from creating new  pages of the selected file type." The Contributor task pane is very helpful when a user is in Contributor mode  because it displays additional links such as Create a new file in this site..., which  will allow the user to perform permitted tasks in an authorized manner.  Workflows Whereas Contributor controls which users are allowed to perform actions,  workflows define what happens when they do so.  Workflows allow rules to be created  without the need to write any code  that are  triggered to perform actions, when associated conditions occur in SharePoint lists   or libraries.  The Wine Company team is interested in workflows because they can use the  functionality already built into SharePoint to allow them to focus on what they are  good at  selling wine , while SharePoint takes care of the workflow for them.  Whenever a new order is placed, it triggers a rule in the workflow that sends an  email to the accounts department notifying them of the new order. Depending on  the payment status, the accounts department either approve or reject the order. If the  order is approved, the workflow progresses and sends an email to the warehouse  staff, notifying them to ship the order.  Workflow Designer Windows Workflow Foundation is built into Windows SharePoint Services 3.0.  SharePoint Designer allows us to plug into this functionality by using its Workflow  Designer feature.  The Microsoft Windows Workflow Foundation component must be installed on the  server and on your computer. If it is not, then you will be prompted to do this the  first time you create a workflow.  [ 87 ]   Collaborating with Other Contributors  Workflows and Lists Because workflows monitor changes to lists or libraries, SharePoint Designer will not  allow us to establish a new workflow unless we have a list or library in our site.  Lists and libraries are discussed in detail in the next few chapters, which cover  collecting and displaying data. For the moment, we can think of lists as being data  stores and libraries as being document stores.  We will create a new list in the example share site, which we are using in this  chapter. SharePoint Designer allows us to create custom lists, but we will be using  one of the predefined lists called Links. We will use this list to hold a list of links to  other websites. To use the predefined lists, follow these steps:  1.  File  New  SharePoint Content. 2.  The Lists option should already be specified in the left-hand pane of the    New dialog.  3.  Click on Links in the central pane. 4.  Leave the name of our list as Links. 5.  Click OK.  It is important to bear in mind that such use of SharePoint Content is only  possible when editing a server-based site. SharePoint Content cannot be  used on disk-based sites.  Our new Links list has been created within our share site, as can be seen in the  Folder List:  [ 88 ]   Notice that four ASPX forms have also been created to allow us to maintain our  Links list. If we browse to one of these new pages in our share team site  e.g.  http:  olmec share lists links allitems.aspx , we will see that a page has  been created using the default master page to display our links.  Chapter 5  Notice too how the new page allows new links  and folders of links  to be created  and that within the Actions drop-down menu, we can choose to be alerted by email  whenever the links change.  [ 89 ]   Collaborating with Other Contributors  It will come as no surprise to learn that this Alert Me feature is an example of  Windows Workflow Foundation functionality. Using Alert Me, new alerts can  be created that alert one or more users to different types of changes to the list. In  particular, I like the way you can specify to only be alerted when other users update  the list  there is little point in alerting yourself to changes you have made, unless you  are having a really bad day! . It is also possible to specify to receive daily or weekly  summaries of changes rather than being inundated everytime a list is updated.  As comprehensive as these alerts are, we can create even more complex workflows  using SharePoint Designer, so let's return there and learn more about creating our  workflows using its Workflow Designer.  Defining New Workflows We can create workflows from within SharePoint Designer by going to File  New   Workflow. The screen below is the first of the two wizard dialogs.  We should select a name for our workflow that will make sense in future  e.g.  NewLinks . It is preferable that the name we choose does not contain any spaces  because it will be used as a filename, as we will see shortly.  [ 90 ]   When we click on the Next > button, we are taken to the core screen of the wizard.  Here, we are able to define the steps that our workflow progresses through.  Chapter 5  We can add as many steps to our workflow as we wish. For each step, we can add a  number of conditions and actions:        Conditions are the triggers for the rules, such as if the list has been updated  by a specific person or user group  e.g. a new member of staff that we are  supervising  or that contains a keyword  e.g. "red" . These conditions can be  set to run together with the and text selected or independently with the or  text selected. Actions are the events that happen when the conditions are met. The most  common action is for an email to be sent.  Once we have set up our steps, we click on Finish. This will add a new Workflows  folder to our Folder List. SharePoint creates an ASPX page within this folder that  allows us to stop and start our workflow from within a browser. On my server, the  address of this workflow would be http:  olmec share workflows newlinks  newlinks.aspx.  To edit our workflow within SharePoint Designer, we would double-click on the  XOML file  e.g. NewLinks.xoml  in our Folder List.  [ 91 ]   Collaborating with Other Contributors  XOML  pronounced zommel  files are standard XAML  pronounced zammel  files  that specifically contain workflow serialization information.  Summary In this chapter, we have seen that SharePoint Designer is more than just a tool to  allow us to design pretty pages. When used properly, it becomes an integral part of a  company's business processes.  Hopefully, you are as impressed by the contribution and workflow tools that we  have at our disposal as I am. In the next chapter, we will learn how to bring new data  into our site.  [ 92 ]   Collecting Data  It is difficult to specify which of SharePoint's features are the most powerful, but the  ability to allow information to be easily submitted to a range of data stores must be  very near to the top of any feature list.  Storing our data in data stores, such as a database or XML file, opens up a large  number of opportunities to us. It allows our site to be easily searchable, our product  list to be easily updated, and data to be shared between our site and external  applications  such as our invoicing or warehousing systems .  In this chapter, we will take a look at the various types of data stores that SharePoint  Designer allows us to connect to and how we can create forms that allow users to  edit, add, and delete records in those stores.  Data Sources SharePoint Designer allows us to connect to virtually every conceivable form of data  store. Details of the data sources that SharePoint Designer can access are:              Business Data Catalog is a new feature in Microsoft Office SharePoint Server  that allows us to create views of business data contained in back-end server  applications  e.g. SAP or Siebel . This feature does not exist in WSS. Database Connections allows us to connect to database servers on our  network that use an SQL Server or OLE data provider. Linked Sources is not so much a data source in its own right, rather a   wizard that allows us to link existing data sources together and access the  resulting views. Server-side Scripts is a great way of easily updating RSS feeds.   Collecting Data              SharePoint Libraries are a less conventional type of data stores in that they  store documents and the information about those documents rather than  being used to store data. These documents can be any type of file  e.g. Word  documents  but can also take the form of InfoPath forms, pictures, or   wiki pages. SharePoint Lists. We already saw an example of a list in the previous  chapter, when we used our links list to demonstrate workflow. Lists can be  thought of as SharePoint-specific databases. XML Files can be used as a data source, as we will see in the example in   a moment. XML Web Services can also be used as a data source. This allows us to  connect to information that is exposed as a web service  e.g. weather  forecasts or stock information .  When working in sites that use many data sources, the Find Data Source task pane  can be used to help find the data source we would like to use.  Creating Our XML Data Source We would like to display a list of products on a new page in our SHARE site. To allow  us to do this, we will first create a new XML file containing our product data:  1.  Select File  New  Page. 2.  With the General option selected, click on Text File and then OK.  Now that we have our Untitled_1.txt file open, we can paste the following XML  data into it:         1   Chateau de l'Hospital   16.99   509       2   Chateau le Gay   94.99   20       [ 94 ]   Chapter 6   3   Goats do Roam Goat Roti   14.99   0       4   Mad Housewife   10.68   1206       5   Thirsty Lizard   6.49   42       1.  Go to File  Save As. 2.  Click on New Folder. 3.  Name the new folder data. 4.  Browse into the new folder. 5.  Change the File name to products.xml. 6.  Change the Save as type to XML. 7.  Click Save.  Once we have added the data to our text file, we can save it as an XML file:  Creating a Data View We will now create a new page in our site to allow us to display our products. Create  this new ASPX page in the root of our site and save it as products.aspx. We are going  to place a data view onto this page so that we can view and edit the data that is  stored in our XML file.  [ 95 ]   Collecting Data  To add our data view into the form tag, go to Data View  Insert Data View.  SharePoint Designer will take a few moments to process this command.  Once SharePoint Designer has finished doing its thing, you will see that a new Data  View  called DataFormWebPart  has been added to our web page.  You will also notice that the Data Source Library task pane has opened  automatically to give us easy access to our data stores. Clicking on the plus   symbol to the left of XML Files will expand the list of XML files, showing our  products.xml file.  [ 96 ]   If you have used older methods of web development, such as creating Classic ASP  sites using DreamWeaver alongside separate database packages, then you are going  to love how simple it is to add data to our SharePoint page. Gone are the days of  flicking backwards and forwards between different applications to look up table and  field names. All we need to do is click on our data source in the task pane and select  Show Data from the drop-down list:  Chapter 6  Doing this displays the contents of our data source in the Data Source Details task  pane. We would like to take the fields from the data source and display them in the  data view that we have on our web page. We select the fields that we would like to  use in our data view by left-clicking on them  holding Ctrl while we do this allows us  to select multiple fields .  [ 97 ]   Collecting Data  We will select the ProductName and Price fields. Once we have selected the fields we would like to use, clicking Insert Selected Fields  as… will allow us to select the type of data view we would like to create. As the name suggests, the View options will display the data in the data view   but will not allow the data to be edited  probably a good idea for the likes of a  public-access price list . The Form options will display the data in a way that allows  items to be edited.  It is important to note that although the Form option may be selected, the data source  may not be updatable because of its own permissions. You will find that for some  data sources  such as custom SQL queries , the Form options won't be visible at all.  In our XML example, there are no such problems.  We will select the Multiple Item Form, which will display all our records in one long  editable data view:  [ 98 ]   Chapter 6  If we open products.aspx in our web browser  e.g. by visiting http:  olmec  share products.aspx , we see that we have a fully operational update form. You  will see that if we change the price of the first wine to 20 and click Save, the data  products.xml file in our site has changed  you will need to re-open the file to see  this change . We can also see this change in the Data Source Details task pane when  we click the Refresh data source link at the bottom of the pane. The first thing I like to do to my new data views is to change the column names. In  our example, we can change ProductName to Product Name. In this example, it is  probably also a good idea to constrain the width of the table  i.e. right-click on the  table, select Table Properties…, and specify the width as 350 pixels  so that the table  does not have as much white space inside it.  Adding and Deleting Records Modifying records is all very well but we also usually like to give our users the  ability to insert and delete records.  To change our data view so that users can insert or delete records, we do   the following:  1.  Click on our data view. 2.  Click on the arrow in the top right-hand corner of the data view. This will   show the Common Data View Tasks list.  We will cover the features in this  list in more depth in the next chapter.  3.  Click on the Data View Properties link. 4.  Select the Editing tab. 5.  We will check the Show delete item links and the Show insert item links    check boxes.  6.  Click OK.  The following image displays the editing link options:  [ 99 ]   Collecting Data  It should be noted that when working with a, SQL data source, we are also given the  option to auto-synchronize the update, delete, and insert commands with the edit,  delete, and insert controls that appear in the data view. If we now browse to our site, we see that insert and delete links have been added to  our form, allowing users to perform those actions.  As we have not included the ability to edit the records in our example, we did not  need to begin with a form, but it is useful that you know how to add such a form for  the times that you will want to allow users to edit records.  Clicking on the insert link creates a simple blank form that we can fill the with details  for our new product  a relatively cheap number from Avalon called Vivacious Vicky :  Clicking save adds the record to our XML file and returns us to our list of products.  If we click on the delete link beside the newly created record, it removes it from the  database for us  note that it does not ask us to confirm that we would like the record  to be deleted to avoid users accidentally deleting data .  InfoPath It's not possible to spend very long reading about SharePoint before the word  InfoPath comes along. InfoPath 2007 is a member of the Microsoft Office family that  allows electronic forms to be created to collect and manage data.  InfoPath forms can be submitted via Outlook email messages, forms for mobile  devices, or browser-based forms. When a form is submitted, the data is saved as XML.  As a result, InfoPath forms can be integrated into most data workflows. InfoPath fits  seamlessly into business processes that use Microsoft BizTalk Server or SharePoint.  [ 100 ]   Chapter 6  We can integrate InfoPath forms into our SharePoint site through the InfoPath form  library  part of the SharePoint Libraries . Creating a new form library is simple:  1.  Expand the SharePoint Libraries node in the Data Source Library task pane. 2.  Click on the Create new Document Library… link. 3.  Ensure that Document Libraries is selected in the left-hand column. 4.  Click on Form Library in the central column. 5.  Specify a name for your document library. 6.  Click OK.  Summary Now that we are equipped to collect data in our SharePoint site, we will move on to  the next chapter, where we will examine the many methods that SharePoint has for  allowing us to display that data.  [ 101 ]    Displaying Data  Now that we have the data view firmly embedded in our page, it is a breeze to  change the way the data looks and operates.  In this chapter, we will learn to apply nice formatting to data that is displayed on  our page. We will learn to do this by making use of Cascading Style Sheets. We will  also learn how to format our data automatically, depending on the data values  a  technique known as conditional formatting . Then we will learn to filter and sort  our data, use formulae to perform calculations, and how to split our data up into  multiple pages.  Formatting the Data View The default data view that we are presented with uses uninspiring black serif text on  a white background. We can jazz up our data view using two different methods:  Direct Formatting It is possible to apply formatting directly to our data view by highlighting the   cells that we wish to format and then using the formatting tools that we learned  about in Chapter 4. This can be a good option if we only want to format a single   data view but is not the best approach if we would like to apply our formatting on a  site-wide basis.  CSS Formatting A more manageable way to apply formatting to our data views is to make the  changes across the entire site by editing our style sheet.   Displaying Data  When we click in the cell that has the Price heading in it, notice that a tag appears  above it, telling us that this cell is referred to as th.ms-vh. That is to say that it is  a table heading  th  element that is being rendered using the ms-vh class  which I  assume stands for Microsoft View Heading . Similarly, if we click in any of the cells  further down the data view, we see that they are referred to as td.ms-vb  standing  for Microsoft View Body . This reference is used to specify the format of the cells in  our table that display the actual data.  In addition, there is an ms-alternating class that renders every other row with a  different background color.  To allow us to edit our styles, we must first create a new blank style sheet, which we  will call share.css:  The next step is to attach our style sheet to our site so that our pages can refer the  styles that we will create within the style sheet:  1.  Select File  New  CSS. 2.  Go to File  Save. 3.  Give the file the name share. 4.  Save the file as CSS Files file type. 5.  Click Save.  1.  Open the Apply Styles task pane. 2.  Click Attach Style Sheet. 3.  Click Browse. 4.  Browse to share.css and click it. 5.  Click Open. 6.  Under Attach to, check All HTML pages. 7.  Click OK. 8.  Click Close on the information dialog.  [ 104 ]   We will then make our style sheet ready to use by defining some styles. Adding the  following code to the style sheet will change the ms-vh and ms-vb classes so that they  are formatted in a more inspiring manner:  Chapter 7  th.ms-vh, td.ms-vb {    font-family:gill sans, gill sans mt, arial, sans-serif; } th.ms-vh {    border-width:0px;    background-color:903;    color:FFF; } td.ms-vb {    color:903;    border-top-width:0px;    border-left-width:0px;    border-right-width:0px;    border-bottom-width:1px;    border-bottom-style:dashed;    font-style:italic; } ourtable{    border-width:0px; }  Notice how the first line of our style sheet refers both ms-vh and ms-vb, with a  comma separating them. This allows us to specify the font face in one place rather  than needing to enter it separately into each class. Grouping styles in this way  not only saves time when creating our site but also makes the site more easily  maintainable when we and other people make changes in the future.  If you are eagle-eyed, you will also notice that the color references  e.g. 903  only  have three digits rather than six. This is possible when a color has repeating numbers   e.g. 99 or 00 , allowing us to condense 990033 to 903.  If you are not familiar with using CSS, do not be put off using it because it is easy to  learn. We also get a helping hand, because when we type code into the style sheet,  SharePoint Designer uses IntelliSense to suggest code we may like to use.  Once we have saved our style sheet, SharePoint Designer instantly reflects changes  to the style sheet in the Design view of products.aspx.  [ 105 ]   Displaying Data  When creating our td.ms-vb style, we specified that dashed lines should appear  below each cell. By default, SharePoint Designer has a default value of 0 for our  borders, meaning that they will not display. In order for the dotted lines to appear,  we will need to make sure that our table has a border value of 1. We can do this  by highlighting the whole table and typing 1 into the border attribute in our Tag  Properties task pane. Selecting ourtable as the class for the table in this task pane  will remove the solid border, allowing our dashed lines to be visible in all their glory.  We can take our formatting even further and use CSS to format the delete and insert  text links so they look like buttons, by giving them a border and some padding.  We can also give our "buttons" a different background color whenever the cursor is  positioned over them.  To add this additional formatting, we will place the following code into our   style sheet:  a:link, a:visited, a:active {    color:903;    padding-top:1px;    padding-bottom:1px;    border-color:903;    border-width:1px;    border-style:solid;    text-decoration:none; } a:hover {    background-color:EEE; }  [ 106 ]   A word of warning about specifying these styles for your links—they will apply to  all links in the share site  and it is unlikely that you would want to do that . It would  be better for us to create a new class  e.g A.funkyButton  that we can use whenever  we want to render our links to look like buttons.  Chapter 7  Conditional Formatting We can make our data views more meaningful by setting up our data view to  automatically use different styles in response to differing data values. This technique  is known as conditional formatting.  Applying conditional formatting in SharePoint Designer requires us to use the XPath  language. Don't worry though because SharePoint Designer makes this easy for us.  We would like to apply some conditional formatting to our data view so that it  shows a differently formatted price for all wines that have a low number in stock. We start this process by right-clicking on our data view and selecting Conditional  Formatting from the shortcut menu. This will open up the Conditional Formatting  task pane.  [ 107 ]   Displaying Data  We then click on the data value that we would like to apply our conditional  formatting to. We will select any of the prices in the data form. Below, I have selected  the price of the most expensive wine, Chateau le Gay.  We then click the Create button in our Conditional Formatting task pane and select  Apply Formatting.  Doing so presents us with the Condition Criteria dialog box. This dialog is used  to specify the conditions for our formatting. To begin using the dialog, we click on  the line that says Click here to add a new clause…. We would like our Price to be  formatted differently if the number of products in stock is less than 10, and so select  the options in the diagram below and then click OK:  [ 108 ]   Chapter 7  Now that we have chosen our criteria, the next screen allows us to specify the style  that will be automatically applied to our Price when the condition is met. In the Font  category, we will select a font-weight of bold, and in the Background category, we  will select a nice bright background-color of yellow  FFFF00 . This vivid style will  ensure that the information stands out to the users of the site.  To modify the condition at a later date, we can click on the condition in our  Conditional Formatting task pane and select Edit condition… from the   drop-down list.  It is also worth noting that it is also possible to use conditional formatting to change  the visibility of the data so that it can be displayed or hidden, depending on the  value. This is useful to show or hide images. For example, if the type of wine is red,  show a red bottle. If white, show a white bottle.  Formatting Numbers It is worth pointing out that it is very easy to format numbers in our data view so  that they display as we would like. We can display our numbers as percentages or as  a currency and specify the number of decimal places that the number should have.  We can also control the 1000 separator so that commas appear in the correct places to  make large numbers more easily readable.  We will take the opportunity to display our prices with a dollar sign in front of them  by doing the following:  1.  Right-click on one of the prices in our data view. 2.  Select Format Item as. 3.  Select Currency. 4.  This will open the Format Number dialog. Ensure that the Symbol is set to $. 5.  Click OK.  Notice that we only needed to select one record and that all prices were formatted in  the same manner.  [ 109 ]   Displaying Data  Filtering Data It is possible to filter our data view so that only certain records are displayed. We  will use this functionality to display only products with a price of over $15. This  feature works in a similar manner to the conditional formatting  albeit there is no  formatting to be applied . To filter our data view, we follow these steps:  1.  Right-click on our data view. 2.  Select Show Common Control Tasks. 3.  Select Filter: from the list. 4.  Click on the first row to add our new clause. 5.  Specify the following values:  a.  Field Name = Price  Number  b.  Comparison = Greater Than c.  Value = 15  6.  Click OK.  You will notice that our data view now only displays the products that are priced  over $15. To remove the filtering, we follow the first three steps so that the Filter Criteria  dialog appears again. We remove our criteria by right-clicking on the black arrow to  the left of the criteria and selecting Remove. Finally, we click OK.  Using Formulae When using SharePoint Designer, it should be remembered that it is a fully-fledged  member of the Microsoft Office suite of products. As such, we can use it to perform  powerful calculations that you would expect other products in the suite  such as  Excel  to perform.  [ 110 ]   Chapter 7  We will add a new column to our data view that will display the total value of the  wine the Wine Company has in stock. We begin this process by clicking on our data  view to select it and then going to Data View  Edit Columns…. The Edit Columns dialog allows us to select the fields in our data set that we would  like to include in our data view. If we would like to add columns to or remove  columns from our data view, this is the dialog that we would use.  The dialog also allows us to add a formula column. We will do this now by clicking  on Add Formula Column… and then clicking on the Add >> button.  The XPath Expression Builder then appears. If you have previously created  formulae in Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Access, then you will be familiar with the  principle behind creating formulae using a builder like this. We can either type our field names into the pane titled Edit the XPath expression  or drag them across from the field list in the left pane. We can also use my personal  favorite method and double-click them across. Whenever we type a space into the  expression pane, IntelliSense suggests appropriate code items including field names  and arithmetic operators  such as +, -,  , and * .  We will use the following simple expression:  Price * InStock  [ 111 ]   Displaying Data  The following image shows the Expression Builder in use:  Once we click the OK button, SharePoint Designer adds our formula to our  Displayed Columns list as Formula 1  important note: this has nothing to do with  fast racing cars! . When we click the next OK button on the Edit Columns dialog, our  formula is added as a new column on the right of our data view. You may wish to  take a moment to resize the width of your data view to 450 pixels and to rename the  last column Total Value.  [ 112 ]   Chapter 7  Sorting Data Hopefully, by now you are impressed with how easy it is to display data using  SharePoint Designer. When it comes to ordering our data, you will continue to   be impressed.  We would like to sort our wines so that the cheapest wines appear first and the more  costly bottles appear last. To do this, we use the sort feature:  1.  Right-click on our data view. 2.  Select Show Common Control Tasks. 3.  Select Sort and Group: from the list. 4.  Click on the Price Number  field and click Add>>. 5.  Click on the ProductName field and click Add>>. 6.  Click OK.  It is worth noting that we can also group similar items together within the data view.  For example, if our data specified whether the wine was red, white, or rosé, then we  would be able to group the data by type.  [ 113 ]   Displaying Data  Allowing Users to Sort the Data It is easy for us to give users the ability to sort the records in the data view. We can  enable this sorting like so:  1.  Click on our data view to select it. 2.  Go to Data View  Change Layout. 3.  Click on the General tab. 4.  Check the Enable sorting and filtering on column headers checkbox. 5.  Click OK.  Once we have saved the page, users will be able to click on the column headings to  sort the records by alphabetical order  or numerical order, provided that the data in  that column are numerical values .  Paging Although our example data only contains five different products, there are a huge  number of wine products in the market  there are about 6,000 wineries in the United  States alone . Naturally, we would not want to display tens of thousands of products  all on one page. By using paging, we can specify the maximum number of records  that will be displayed in our data view at one time. Depending on the options we  have specified, users may be able to click forwards and backwards through the data  view, displaying the next records each time they do so.  1.  Right-click on our data view. 2.  Select Show Common Control Tasks. 3.  Select Paging: from the list. 4.  Click on the Display items in sets of this size: radio button. 5.  Enter 4 into the field. 6.  Click OK.  [ 114 ]   Chapter 7  Summary Over the course of the last two chapters, we have discovered how easy it is to  interrogate a whole range of data sources and display information from them in our  SharePoint site in an attractive and useful manner.  In the following chapters, we will be examining a range of different controls that we  can add to our site to perform specific actions, with the need for virtually no coding  on our part.  [ 115 ]    Adding Web Parts  In the final four chapters of this book, we will see how we can make our SharePoint  site do more, adding ASP.NET controls and Web Parts to our pages.  In this chapter, we will focus on Web Parts. We will learn what they are used for  and how to insert them into our pages. We will also take some time to examine the  benefits and use of Web Part Zones.  What Are Web Parts? Components have traditionally been used to add extra functionality to websites  in a modular fashion. With the advent of Microsoft's .NET, came the ability for  programmers to create ASP.NET Web Parts that could be embedded within web  pages to give those pages additional functionality  e.g. a shopping basket . One of  the main benefits of these Web Parts is that they only need to be programmed once  and can be reused in different parts of our site  or indeed in many different sites .  SharePoint provides us with specialist Web Parts that can be placed in our page to  allow the end user to perform a specific function  e.g. interact with a calendar  within  their browser.  Web Parts are much more powerful than traditional components because they also  allow us to specify which users can edit the Web Parts.  There are many Web Parts included with Microsoft Office SharePoint Server and  others are available to download free of charge. Microsoft used to host an online  SharePoint Products and Technologies Web Component Directory  which it   renamed to the snappier-titled SharePoint Utility Suite , but this directory is no  longer available.  Other Web Parts are full-blown commercial products and must be paid for. The  prices of components are often high and usually priced per SharePoint server. Some  components also require an ongoing annual license to be paid.   Adding Web Parts  You can access Web Parts for SharePoint that will do the following  and more :                       Calendar and Schedule Charting, Graphing, and Gauging Data Entry Data Grids E-commerce Search Toolbars and Menus Tree Views and Lists Modification of the User Interface Wikis  Web Part Zones Web Parts can be placed directly onto our page, as we did with the Data Form Web  Part in the last chapter. This is nice and simple to do.  Often we wish to have greater control over our Web Parts. This is where Web Part  Zones come in. By adding our Web Parts into Web Part Zones, we can perform two  different types of functions.  Firstly, the use of Web Part Zones allows us to specify the permissions for the Web  Parts contained within them. In this way, we can dictate which users are able to  modify the Web Parts in their browser.  The other purpose of Web Part Zones is to allow us to lay out our Web Parts in a  pre-determined manner  without needing to resort to using a table to do so . We  can choose to either lay out our Web Parts vertically or horizontally, as in this image   where the Category Web Part is placed beside the Choice Filter Web Part :  [ 118 ]   Chapter 8  Inserting a Web Part Zone Let's create a new page and add a Web Part Zone to that page:  1.  Open up the share site in SharePoint Designer. 2.  Go to File  New  ASPX. 3.  Select File  Save. 4.  Give your page the name feeds. 5.  Set the Save as type to ASPX Files. 6.  Change the title to RSS Feeds. 7.  Click Save. 8.   If you do not already have the Web Parts task pane open, then open it using  Task Panes  Web Parts.  9.  Click on the New Web Part Zone button, which is located at the bottom of   the Web Parts task pane. This will add a new zone to our page called Zone 1.  10.  In the Web Part Zone Properties dialog, give the zone the title RSS Feeds   and uncheck the three permissions check boxes at the foot of the dialog.  11.  Click OK.  The following image shows the Web Part Zone Properties dialog:  [ 119 ]   Adding Web Parts  Inserting a Web Part Now that we have created our Web Part Zone, we will go ahead and add a Web Part  inside the new zone. To do this, we simply click and drag the RSS Viewer Web Part  from the Web Parts task pane into the RSS Feeds Web Part zone that we just created.  It should be noted that the RSS Viewer Web Part is only available on  MOSS. It is not included with WSS.  Once we have done this, the Web Part will display a message that it is not bound to a  feed. We can remedy this by specifying an RSS feed for it to display.  [ 120 ]   Right-click on the Web Part we have just placed in the designer and select Web Part  Properties from the shortcut menu. We are going to use our Web Part to display the  contents of an interesting feed that Microsoft's SharePoint team publishes. To do this,  all we need to do is add the following URL into the RSS Feed URL field:  http:  www.microsoft.com feeds msdn en-us sharepoint rss.xml  Chapter 8  [ 121 ]   Adding Web Parts  Once we have clicked OK, our Web Part is ready to display the contents of the feed  on our web page. Do not worry if SharePoint Designer gives you a vague message  about a non-specific data source error; simply save the page and point your browser  to the feeds.aspx page we created. You should then be able to view the feed  contents and drill down into each of them for more detail.  We could of course use any RSS feed, but this one seemed like a suitable example.  Feel free to add other RSS Viewer Web Parts to the Web Part Zone so that this page  contains other useful SharePoint resources. For example, you may wish to add one  displaying the contents of http:  www.2f3.com xml sharepoint.asp.  In Chapter 10, we will see how to add other SharePoint Web Parts when we integrate  our site with Exchange Server.  Adding Graphs It is also possible to add components that are not part of the standard SharePoint  installation. We will use a Web Part that will display order information graphically.  To allow us to do this, we will first of all add a new list to our site that will contain  the order data:  1.  Open the Data Source Library task pane. 2.  Maximize the SharePoint Lists category within the task pane, if it is not   already open.  [ 122 ]   Chapter 8  3.  Click once on the Lists folder in the Folder List task pane. We do this to   specify that our new list should be created inside this folder.  4.  Click on the Create New SharePoint List… link in our Data Source Library   task pane.  5.  Click on Custom List in the central column of the dialog box. 6.  Specify OrderTotals as the list name. 7.  Click OK.  Now that we have created our new list, we can add a couple of fields to it:  1.  Browse to our list using your favorite web browser    e.g. http:  olmec share Lists OrderTotals  .  2.  Click on Settings  Create Column. 3.  Give your column the name sMonth and ensure that the type of information   for our column is set to Single Line of Text, then click OK.  4.  Click on Settings  Create Column once more. 5.  Give your column the name iOrders and ensure that the type of information   for our column is set to Number, then click OK.  Notice that I use the prefix s in my variable names to denote that it is a  string and the prefix i to denote the use of an integer.  The following image shows the Create Column button that we select during   this process:  [ 123 ]   Adding Web Parts  Now that we have set up our list, let's add some data to it. Clicking on the New  button in our site allows us to add a new record. I have added examples for the first  half of 2008. Note that iOrders does not mean anything specific in our example. In  real life, it could be the number of distinct orders, the number of products ordered,  or the total value of the orders.  Please go ahead and add the following six records to your list  note that February  was a particularly boozy month, perhaps because of Valentine's Day :  [ 124 ]   Chapter 8  Now that we have exposed our data as a list, we can go ahead and display it in  a graph. The graphing Web Part we are going to use is called Dundas Chart for  SharePoint. This component is fairly pricey, but thankfully, we can download a free  evaluation copy at www.dundas.com. The evaluation has no limit on how long you  can use it for  it has a watermark on it to differentiate it from the full price version . If  you would prefer to use a free product, then Ian Morrish's Chart Web Part is worth a  look. It can be downloaded from http:  cid-62b84429c3a8a991.skydrive.live. com browse.aspx SharePoint.  Once you have downloaded and installed the evaluation software on your  SharePoint server, you will be able to access the component in your Web Part  Gallery. When installing the Web Part, ensure that you select the MOSS option.  We will use these pretty graphs to display some order information on a new page  in our share site. Go ahead and create a new page called orders.aspx and add a  new Web Part Zone called Order Graphs to the page. The only difference with this  new Web Part Zone will be that we should specify that the layout of the Web Parts is  Side-by-side rather than Top-to-bottom. Once we have created our Web Part Zone, click and drag the Dundas Chart Web  Part from the Web Parts task pane into our Order Graphs Web Part Zone.  With this particular Web Part, we do not use the Web Part Properties dialog in  SharePoint Designer to configure the chart. Instead, let's save our page and browse to  it using our browser  e.g. http:  olmec share orders.aspx .  [ 125 ]   Adding Web Parts  We can customize the appearance of our graph and connect to our data by   clicking on the Wizard List… link that appears in the browser window above the  example graph.  The Customize Your Chart link in the Chart Wizard List allows us to customize the  look of our chart. For this example, I have selected the 3D Column chart type. Great  fun can be had tweaking the chart appearance. I have added transparency of 50%  and a Flash animation  Growing One By One  to my chart.  [ 126 ]   Chapter 8  Once you are done making your chart look pretty, it is time to connect it to our data  source. This can be done by clicking on the Connect Chart To Data link in the Chart  Wizard List:  In step 1, we will choose to Connect to A Site Definition List. In step 2, we select OrderTotals from the List drop-down.  1.  2.  3.  We could filter our list in step 3, but we will not do that in our example. 4.   In step 4, the wizard automatically suggests that we would like to use our  order totals  iOrders  on the Y-axis and our long title  Title  on the X-axis.  We will change our X-axis to use our shorter month titles  sMonth  so that  they fit on the page better.  Once we click Finish, our graph is displayed for us.  Summary In this chapter, we learned what Web Parts are and how they can be added to our  site  with the help of examples, where we added an RSS Viewer and a chart to our  site . We also learned about the benefits of grouping our Web Parts within Web   Part Zones.  In the following chapter, we will examine how to use similar controls, specifically the  ASP.NET user controls.  [ 127 ]    Using ASP.NET Controls  As SharePoint and the underlying .NET Framework developed over the years, more  readymade controls have become available for us to use in our applications. Such  controls allow us to drop common, and often complex, features into our site. For  example, if we would like to add user registration and login features  often referred  to as personalization and membership  to our site, it is a chore to build everything we  require  registration form with validation, login box, password reminder, change  password, etc.  each time we build a site. Microsoft has built these controls for us so  that we can easily add them to our site. In this chapter, we will examine the use of  these controls.  Very occasionally, we find that we are not able to do what we would like to do with  the SharePoint configuration that comes "out of the box". A common example of this  is using forms authentication in our site. Later on in the chapter, we will also make  some configuration changes to SharePoint and associated products, such as Internet  Information Services  IIS , SQL Server, and Visual Studio, to demonstrate how forms  authentication can be enabled.  ASP.NET Controls We can view the controls that are available by opening up the Toolbox task pane  and maximizing the ASP.NET Controls option. Within this option, there are six  categories of controls. Of these, we can ignore the WebParts option because that is  simply a link to the Web Parts task pane.  It should be noted that it is not possible to use ASP.NET WebParts in SharePoint  2007 sites. It is, however, possible for developers to create their new user controls  as SmartParts  see http:  www.codeplex.com smartpart  to allow them to be  included within WSS and MOSS sites.   Using ASP.NET Controls  The five remaining categories are:  Standard Controls This contains a large number of controls. Most of these are simple, for example:  The Image control, which displays a picture. The Label control, which displays text. The Hyperlink control, which we will use to link from our homepage  shortly.  In addition, we have standard controls that are somewhat more exciting:  The FileUpload control allows files to be uploaded to the server from the  user's computer. The Wizard control allows a multi-step form to be added to our site. At each  step of the wizard, the user is asked for different information. The Xml control allows data from an XML document to be displayed on  our page  although you may find it easier to use a Data View to display the  contents of your XML file . The Calendar control, which we will also add to our site later in this chapter.                     Data Controls The data controls allow us to connect to various different data sources, display the  results on our page, and update the data in the source.  [ 130 ]   Because SharePoint already provides us with access to data sources in the Data  Source Library task pane, we can safely ignore these controls.  Chapter 9  Validation Controls The validation controls allow us to validate information input by the user. We will  see this in practice towards the end of the chapter, when we add validation to a form.  Navigation Controls The navigation controls provide us with three different methods of helping users  navigate our site. The Menu and TreeView controls would allow users to browse to  a particular page, while the SiteMapPath control displays breadcrumbs that show  their position within the page hierarchy. We will see an example of the Menu control  later in this chapter.  Login Controls The login controls allow us to take advantage of ASP.NET's extensive membership  provider system. The benefit of this is that we no longer need to manually create all  the elements required by a login system  i.e. registration, login, password reminder,  etc. . We will also look at this in detail in this chapter.  [ 131 ]   Using ASP.NET Controls  Further information about virtually all of the ASP.NET server controls, including  examples and code snippets, is available in the ASP.NET Control Reference in the  .NET Framework SDK, which is available at http:  quickstarts.asp.net .  Adding a Simple Control In this chapter, we will be using various server controls in our pages.  We will start by adding one of the simplest controls to our homepage:  1.  Open the share site in SharePoint Designer. 2.  Open the default.aspx page in Design view. 3.  Make sure that the Standard controls are visible in the Toolbox task pane. 4.  Click on the HyperLink control and drag it onto our page. 5.  Right-click on the control that we have just placed and select Properties from  the shortcut menu. This will open the Tag Properties task pane to the left of  our design window.  6.  Type View Orders Graph into the Text field in the Tag Properties task pane. 7.  Click on the ellipsis to the right of the NavigateUrl field and select orders.  aspx from the list of pages.  8.  Finally, save the page.  The following image shows the Properties shortcut menu that we see as we work  through this process:  Now, when we open http:  olmec share  in our browser, we see that the default  page links to the Order Graphs.  [ 132 ]   Chapter 9  The Menu Control One of the most popular controls at our disposal is the Menu control. This allows us  to add a navigation menu to the pages of our site to allow users to move from one  page to another.  The Menu control is particularly useful because it can be populated by a data source.  In this way, we could automatically display all the wines in our product range  we  could even have a red wine menu button with all the red wines as a submenu and  likewise with the white wines .  For our example, we will stay with the default.aspx page and add a menu control  beneath our link to the graph page:  1.  Drag a Menu control from the Navigation group in the Standard controls in   the Toolbox onto the default.aspx page beneath the existing link.  2.  The Common Menu Tasks options will automatically open for us. We will   3.  This brings up the Menu Item Editor, which allows us to add our links to    click on Edit Menu Items.  the menu.  4.  We will add our first link by clicking on the Add a root item button  which is   the first one on the small menu bar .  5.  We can then set the properties for the link. We will do this by specifying   default.aspx as our NavigateUrl and Home as our Text.  6.  We can add more root menu items by repeating steps 4 and 5 as often   as we wish. We will add a further root item with products.aspx as our  NavigateUrl and Products as our Text.  7.  Before we close our Menu Item Editor, we will add a couple of external   links as child items of another root item. We will begin this by adding a third  root item and giving it the Text External Links. There is no need to add a  NavigateUrl this time.  8.  With the External Links node selected, we will then click on the Add a  child item button  the second one on the small menu bar  and give this   new item http:  www.2f3.com as our NavigateUrl and 2F3 Internet as  our Text.  9.  Taking care to select the External Links node again, we will add another  child item with http:  www.packtpub.com as our NavigateUrl and Packt  Publishing as our Text.  10.  Finally, we will click OK and then save our page.  [ 133 ]   Using ASP.NET Controls  This image shows the Menu Item Editor that we use to add our menu items:  When we view the homepage of our site, we will see the new menu items available  to the user. Note that the External Links link has an arrow beside it to notify the  user that it contains child links. It should also be noted that this control would  usually be placed on every page of the site rather than just one page.  The Calendar Control One of the nicest controls that SharePoint provides us with is the Calendar control.  This control makes it easy for users to add a date into a form field. You will no doubt  have seen these controls in use when booking a flight or a hotel room online. They  are especially useful in helping to prevent confusion that can arise from the different  way that North America and Europe treat dates  i.e. month day year as opposed to  day month year .  We will add a Calendar control to a new page and use it to populate a text field:  1.  Create a new ASPX page and call it birthday.aspx. 2.  Type My birthday is: into the form on the page.  [ 134 ]   Chapter 9  3.  Drag a TextBox control from the Standard controls in the Toolbox onto the   page to the right of the text we have just added.  4.  Right-click on the TextBox control and select Properties from the    shortcut menu.  5.  Change the ID of the TextBox from TextBox1 to txtBirthday. 6.  Next, we will drag a Calendar control from the Standard controls in the   7.  Right-click on the Calendar control and select Properties from the    Toolbox onto the page.  shortcut menu.  8.  Change the ID of the Calendar from Calendar1 to calBirthday.  Now that we have added the controls to our page, we must make the Calendar  control interact with the TextBox. The following code will place the date into the text  box when the calendar is used. We will put it at the top of our page in Code view:      private void calBirthday_SelectionChanged  object sender, System. EventArgs e  {       txtBirthday.Text = calBirthday.SelectedDate.ToShortDateString  ; }    We must also edit the Calendar control so that it fires that event:  <asp:Calendar runat="server" id="calBirthday" OnSelectionChanged="calB irthday_SelectionChanged">   We can now view the page in our browser  e.g. http:  olmec share birthday. aspx . Notice that when we save our page, SharePoint will give us the following  error message:  An error occurred during the processing of  share birthday.aspx. Code blocks are  not allowed in this file.  This is because SharePoint is protective about what code it allows us to run. By  default, it disables server-side scripts. This is not a problem though, because   we can override the prohibition. To do so, we require a small lesson in editing the  web.config file.  [ 135 ]   Using ASP.NET Controls  Editing the web.config File The web.config file specifies the settings not just for the share site but also for other  sites sharing the same port  port 80  on our SharePoint server. It should be noted that  any mistakes we make could stop SharePoint from working. Even if you are working  using administrator permissions, it is recommended that you check with your server  administrator that it is OK for you to edit this file. It is always a good idea to do this  before you edit it, rather than after you have edited it and the sites have crashed!  By default, we will find the file in C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\wss\ VirtualDirectories\80  where 80 is the port number of our SharePoint site  on our  server. Before we begin tinkering with this file, it is a good idea to make a backup of  it  e.g. web.config.bak .  You may find using Remote Desktop the easiest way to access your server  to edit this file.  We will change the following lines of code in our web.config file:             <PageParserPath VirtualPath=" share birthday.aspx"  CompilationMode="Always" AllowServerSideScript="true"  >     We could have left the VirtualPath blank so that server-side scripts are allowed in  all SharePoint sites, but limiting it in this way ensures that only our birthday page  has script access.  Once this change to the configuration file has been saved, the calendar on our  birthday page will operate correctly. When we click on one of the dates, it will be  pasted into the txtBirthday field.  While we are tinkering with the web.config file, you may find it useful to change  the following line:  to:  to:        [ 136 ]   Making this change will provide us with additional information in the run-time error  messages, which will help us troubleshoot our code. For security reasons, this should  be returned to the On mode when our site is ready to go live.  Chapter 9  Validating Our Forms We can add validation controls to our form that will check the information input by  the user. If they input an incorrect value, then an error message will be displayed.  There are several different types of validation controls. Each performs a specific type  of validation when the form is updated. We will add a RangeValidator to our form to check that the birthday we have  selected is credible:  1.  Click and drag a RangeValidator control onto our form. 2.  Right-click on the validation control and select Properties from the    shortcut menu.  3.  Set the ControlToValidate to txtBirthday. 4.  Change the Type from String to Date. 5.  Set the MinimumValue to 1 1 1880. 6.  Set the MaximumValue to 1 1 2009. 7.  Set the ErrorMessage to Please select a credible birthday.  If we return to our birthday page in our web browser, we see that if we enter a  spurious date such as 1 1 1850 and then press Enter to cause a postback, the  validation kicks in and we are greeted with an error message.  Creating a Login Feature We know that SharePoint allows users to log in using Windows Authentication    i.e. their network login . What if we would like to provide a login to our site to  allow users from outside the network to log in? This is a very common requirement,  yet with SharePoint 2003, it proved highly problematic because there was no out- of-the-box alternative and the workarounds that programmers came up with had  undesirable side effects.  The good news is that with SharePoint 2007, we can specify the Membership Provider  that we would like our site to use. As you will see, implementing this functionality  still requires a fair amount of configuring the various servers in our farm, but the  solution we end up with is more elegant than it was with SharePoint 2003.  [ 137 ]   Using ASP.NET Controls  We are going to use the AspNetSqlMembershipProvider in conjunction with the  ready-made ASP.NET Login controls to allow our users to create and use a username  and password. This login will be stored in our SQL Server database as a new user  account in the ASP.NET 2.0 membership system.  Let's go ahead and create a new ASPX page, which we will call register.aspx. We  then click and drag the CreateUserWizard control from the Login category of our  ASP.NET controls and drop it in the form on our new page. SharePoint Designer  automatically creates a fairly ubiquitous registration form for us:  As with our WebParts, we can open the list of Common Tasks by clicking on the  form and then clicking on the right-hand arrow that appears in the top right-hand  corner of the control. This allows us to control our CreateUserWizard control. It should be noted that the registration process is highly configurable, allowing us to  specify exactly which pieces of information are required from the registrant. It is also  possible to add as many stages to the registration process as we wish.  If you agree that this form looks uninspiring, then go ahead and give it a pre-defined  formatting scheme by clicking on the AutoFormat… link and taking your pick from  the five different schemes. I have chosen the Classic scheme for my example. If you save this page, then view it in your browser  e.g. http:  olmec share  register.aspx , you will get a SharePoint error when you try to submit the form.  The error occurs because we have not specified where SharePoint should store the  user data. Let's go ahead and set up our data store.  [ 138 ]   Chapter 9  Configuring SQL Server To provide a home for the user data, we will need to set up specific tables in our  SQL Server. Thankfully, Microsoft has provided us with a tool that will do this for  us. You will find this aspnet_regsql.exe program in the relevant .NET Framework  folder on your server  e.g. C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727 .  Running through the wizard steps in this tool is simple:  1.  Click Next >. 2.  Select Configure SQL Server for application services. 3.  Click Next >. 4.  Type in the name of your server into the Server box. Note that this    may be more than just the name of the server that your database is stored on  and should also include the instance name  e.g. OLMEC OFFICESERVERS or  .\SQLEXPRESS .  5.  Select your database from the drop-down list. In my example, it is    called SHARE. 6.  Click Next >. 7.  Click Next > on the summary screen and Finish on the confirmation screen.  Note that SQL Server must be configured to allow remote connections.  If we peek inside our database, we will see that the following tables were created by  the wizard:  [ 139 ]   Using ASP.NET Controls  The aspnet_Users table holds information about users  e.g. UserID and UserName ,  while the aspnet_Membership table holds additional information about the user   such as Password, Email, PasswordQuestion .  The next thing that we need to do is to set up the authentication so we can connect to  our SQL database:  1.  Open SQL Server Management Studio. 2.  Right-click on your chosen database server in Object Explorer. 3.  Select Properties from the shortcut menu. 4.  Select the Security option in the left-hand pane of the Server    5.  Change the Server authentication to SQL Server and Windows   Properties dialog.  Authentication mode.  6.  Click OK. 7.  Open the Security, then the Logins folders in the Object Explorer. 8.  Right-click on the sa user. 9.  Select Properties from the shortcut menu. 10.  Choose a new password that conforms to your password policy  e.g.   Bunnyrabb1t  and type it into the Password and Confirm Password fields.  11.  Click OK. 12.  Right-click on the chosen database server in Object Explorer again. 13.  Select Restart from the shortcut menu. 14.  Click Yes.  Adding Our First User In order to access our application, we will add a new user to our tables.  Unfortunately, this is not as straightforward as one would hope. The easiest way to do this would be to drop the Login control onto our register. aspx page and then select Administer Website from the Common Login Tasks list.  This should in turn launch the Web Site Administration Tool  WAT , which would  allow us to add our user. Unfortunately, the WAT is only available in Visual Studio  2005  which also uses this control .  [ 140 ]   Chapter 9  In order to use the WAT to add our new user, we must download Microsoft Visual  Web Developer 2005 Express Edition from http:  www.microsoft.com express   and install it on our workstation.  Once we have installed Visual Studio, we come across another issue that we must  overcome. We cannot simply add a new site to our SharePoint server because the  default site is already being used for SharePoint sites. We must set up a new virtual  site in Internet Information Server  IIS  and connect Visual Studio to that site using a  different port number.  Adding a New Virtual Server As we have mentioned, it will not be possible to use Visual Studio to set up a new  site because SharePoint is already using port 80. We will need to manually set up a  new site on our SharePoint server that uses a different port number:  1.  Go to Start  All Programs  Administrative Tools  Internet Information   Services  IIS  Manager.  2.  Expand the server tag  e.g. Olmec . 3.  Right-click on Web Sites and select New  Web Site… from the shortcut   menu.  4.  Click Next >. 5.  Give our site a description  e.g. adduser . 6.  Click Next >. 7.  Set the TCP port number to 8080. 8.  Click Next >. 9.  Click Browse and select the location in which we would like to create a new   site  e.g. c:\inetpub\wwwroot\ , then create a new folder called adduser.  10.  Click OK. 11.  Click Next >. 12.  Check Run Scripts  such as ASP . 13.  Click Next >. 14.  Click Finish.  [ 141 ]   Using ASP.NET Controls  Adding a Host Header Visual Studio will not recognize an address with a port number in it as a valid  virtual path  see http:  connect.microsoft.com VisualStudio feedback  ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=106146 for more information , so before we can  connect to our new site with Visual Studio, we must set up a host header using IIS:  1.  Right-click on our adduser site and select Properties. 2.  With the Web Site tab selected, click on the Advanced button. 3.  Click Add…. 4.  Type 8080 into the TCP port. 5.  Type in a Host Header value  e.g. adduser.olmec.malbet.local .  Adding an A Record In order for traffic to find the correct server, we must add an  A  name to our DNS  server. We will do the following on the server that looks after our network's DNS:  1.  Go to Start  All Programs  Administrative Tools  DNS. 2.  Expand the host name server. 3.  Expand the Forward Lookup Zones. 4.  Right-click on the zone you would like to administer  e.g. malbet.local . 5.  Select New Host  A …. 6.  Type adduser.olmec in the Name field. 7.  Type the IP address of your SharePoint server into the IP address box. 8.  Click Add Host.  It will take a short while  e.g. 10 minutes  for the DNS changes to propagate through  the network.  Extending the Virtual Server We will be connecting to our new virtual server with Visual Studio over HTTP.   For this to work, FrontPage Server extensions must be installed and enabled on   our server.  If FrontPage Extensions are not installed on the server, this can be done  by going into Control Panel  Add or Remove Programs  Add Remove  Windows Components  Application Server  Details  Internet  Information Services  Details  FrontPage 2002 Server Extensions.  [ 142 ]   You may have thought that having done this would allow the FrontPage extensions  to work, but there is one more step we must perform before they will work. We must  extend our virtual server. To do this, right-click on our new virtual server in the IIS  server tree and select All Tasks  Configure Server Extensions 2002:  Chapter 9  This brings up a simple form that allows us to extend the server with the FrontPage  extensions. Simply click Submit and watch the very funky cogwheel graphic while  we wait.  [ 143 ]   Using ASP.NET Controls  If we are not logged into our workstation with the username that we specified in the  extend form, then we must add our username in the Manage users section of the  administration site.  Using Visual Studio's Web Site Administration  Tool It is now possible to use Visual Studio to set up a new site on our new website:  1.  Go to File  New Web Site. 2.  Select ASP.NET Web Site. 3.  Set Location to HTTP. 4.  Specify http:  adduser.olmec.malbet.local  as the location. 5.  Click OK.  Your new blank website will be set up on the server for you. Notice that you can also  view the new blank page by pointing your web browser at http:  olmec:8080 .  Now that we have our new website set up, we can access the WAT by selecting  Website  ASP.NET Configuration.  [ 144 ]   Once you have the WAT open, you will want to click on the Security tab:  Chapter 9  Once in the security page, you will be able to go to Select authentication type and  change the authentication type from the local network  i.e. Windows authentication   to the internet  i.e. Forms authentication :  [ 145 ]   Using ASP.NET Controls  Now that you have set up the authentication type, you can click on the Create User  link on the Security page and create your user:  Thankfully, setting up a new user in the membership provider will be far easier in  Windows Server 2008, which will allow the "Add User" feature in IIS7 to be used.  Changing the Authentication Provider The next thing that we need to do is specify that our site should use   forms authentication:  1.  Open the SharePoint Central Administration Website  SCAW  in our browser    e.g. http:  olmec:44936  .  2.  Click on Application Management. 3.  Under the Application Security heading, click the Authentication    4.  Click on the Web Application drop-down list and select Change    Providers link.  Web Application.  [ 146 ]   Chapter 9  5.  Click on the site we would like to change  e.g. SharePoint – 80 . 6.  Click on our zone  e.g. Default . 7.  Change the Authentication Type from Windows to Forms. 8.  We will also check the Enable anonymous access box for now, so that we  are not left with the Catch 22 situation of not being able to log in to register  because we do not have a login yet.  9.  Type AspNetSqlMembershipProvider into the Membership provider    name field. 10.  Click Save.  You should now see the sites on port 80  the default port  correctly configured to use  SQL Server as our membership provider:  It is important to note that changing the authentication type of our sites in this  way means that SharePoint Designer will no longer be able to connect to them.  When we need to edit the site in SharePoint Designer, we will need to switch the  authentication type back to Windows authentication. Return to the Application Management screen in your SCAW and select Policy for  Web Application.  1.  Click the Add Users link. 2.  Select the zone our site is in  Default . 3.  Click Next >. 4.  We are then able to select the user s  from our user database and the   permissions we would like to grant them.  5.  Once we have finished, click Finish.  [ 147 ]   Using ASP.NET Controls  Return to the web.config File The next thing that we need to do is add the following code to the    section of the web.config file.  Note that the   section cannot be placed before  the   section.  This will allow our SharePoint site to connect to our user database:                <add name="LocalSqlServer" connectionString="data  source=OLMEC OFFICESERVERS; initial catalog=aspnetdb; user id=sa;  password=Bunnyrabb1t;" >     or if you prefer to use integrated security, you can use this:                <add name="LocalSqlServer" connectionString="data source= OLMEC  OFFICESERVERS;Integrated Security=SSPI; AttachDBFilename=DataDire ctoryaspnetdb.mdf; User Instance=true" providerName="System.Data. SqlClient" >     Once these changes have been made, it is a good idea to restart the SharePoint Server   or stop and start the site in IIS .  Additional Configuration Tweaks The following can also be added to the   section to specify the   strength of the password policy used  by default, it is 7 characters, including one  non-alphanumeric character, so we are allowing it to be a bit weaker :      <add name="SHAREProvider" type="System.Web. Security.SqlMembershipProvider" connectionStringNam e="ConnectionString" minRequiredPasswordLength="5"  minRequiredNonalphanumericCharacters="0" >      [ 148 ]   Chapter 9  While we are on the topic of the Create User control, you might be interested to  know that it is possible to automatically send a welcome email to the user by adding  a MailDefinition tag between the existing asp:CreateUserWizard tags in the   code view:       <MailDefinition       BodyFileName="NewUserEmail.txt"     From="welcome@2f3.com"     Subject="Welcome to the site!" >      For the email to be relayed, you will need to specify the SMTP server in the web. config file  and have the SMTP service enabled on the server :                               Summary In this chapter, we have learned what ASP.NET controls are and which ones are  available to us. We also saw how to implement simple controls, menu controls,  calendar controls, validation controls, and login controls into our pages.  In the following chapter, we will take this one step further and make use of the  controls and Web Parts that are unique to SharePoint.  [ 149 ]    Integrating with Exchange  One of the reasons that I like SharePoint is that it helps remove boundaries between  Office and server products, allowing us to provide the user with more of the  information they need. There is no better example of this interconnectivity than  displaying mailbox items in the user's browser.  In this chapter, we will learn about the opportunities that exist to embed information  from our Exchange Server within our SharePoint site. By way of example, we will  be adding our tasks list to the site, but it is also possible to add other Exchange  information such as calendars, contacts, and of course email.  When adding this functionality, there are a few configuration changes that may  be required. We will examine these so that if you meet these hurdles when  implementing your solution, they can be easily overcome.  Introduction to Outlook Web Access   Web Parts Over the years, as Microsoft's Exchange Server has matured, the number of access  methods that users have to the information stored on the server has increased. The  last five years in particular have seen great improvements in the ability to connect to  your mailbox using nothing more than a web browser or a mobile phone.  Because the nature of SharePoint is to allow easy access to information and to  improve team collaboration, it is only right that SharePoint should increase our  options when it comes to being able to access Exchange information.   Integrating with Exchange  In this chapter, we will take a look at the Web Parts that are available to us and  learn how to add them to our SharePoint site. The Web Parts that we are going to  use can be integrated into any ASP.NET application  irrespective of whether it is  running on a SharePoint server or not  and make use of Outlook Web Access  OWA ,  which exposes the Exchange data. You will hear the Web Parts referred to as either  Outlook Web Access Web Parts or, less commonly, Exchange Web Parts. There is no  difference between the two.  One of the beauties of using Exchange Web Parts is that we can mix and match the  views that are displayed on our web page to suit our business needs. If we want to  have our company's customer service, sales, and info inboxes all displayed on one  page, then Exchange Web Parts allow us to do that.  It should be noted that Exchange integration is not supported by  WSS. MOSS will be required if you would like to integrate Exchange  information within your SharePoint site.  Viewing the Outlook Web Access   Web Parts We can access our OWA Web Parts by opening the Web Parts task pane in  SharePoint Designer. We can then filter the Web Part list to only show Outlook Web  Access Web Parts by clicking on the Filter link and selecting Outlook Web Access  from the Show drop-down list.  [ 152 ]   You will note that there are five Outlook Web Access Web Parts, each of which  allows us to add Exchange functionality to our web page:  Chapter 10                 My Calendar allows us to display a calendar for an Exchange user. We  can specify that the calendar will default to either a weekly or a daily view   although the user can switch views when they are using the calendar . I find  the day view particularly useful because when we click on the appointment,  it displays the details of the appointment to the right of the calendar,  allowing us to change them. When using this Web Part, it should be noted  that there is no design-time preview. My Contacts will display the user's entire contact list. We can again specify  the default view as either a phone list or a two-line view. The user cannot  change the type of view that they have displayed on the page. My Inbox does exactly as we would expect, by displaying the emails that  are in the root folder of the user's inbox. There are lots of default views for  this Web Part. We can select Two-line, messages, or order by sender, subject,  or conversation. The user then has the option to arrange their mail by 11  different parameters. My Mail Folder allows us to display the contents of any private or public  folder. There are no default views for this Web Part. When setting up the  Web Part, we specify the name of the folder of which we would like to  display the contents. If you would like to display the contents of a subfolder,  you can specify myFolder mySubfolder. My Tasks will display the user's task list. We will learn more about this Web  Part shortly.  In order for our page to connect to the Exchange Server, we will need to correctly  configure our Exchange Server by ensuring that OWA and Forms-Based  Authentication are both enabled.  Enabling Outlook Web Access OWA should be enabled by default. We can verify if OWA is set up on the server by  attempting to view our mail in our web browser. If you are using Exchange Server  2007, then the address will be in the format https:  servername owa .  If OWA is not enabled on our server, then we can enable it by using the Exchange  Management Console. Managing Exchange Server is outside the scope of this book.  For further information about managing OWA, see http:  technet.microsoft. com en-us library aa996373.aspx.  [ 153 ]   Integrating with Exchange  Enabling Forms-Based Authentication In order for our OWA Web Parts to display correctly, we must configure our  Exchange Server to use forms-based authentication.  The following instructions are for Exchange Server 2007. The same thing  can be achieved using Exchange System Manager in earlier versions   of Exchange.  To enable forms-based authentication, do the following on our server:  1.  Open the Exchange Management Console. 2.  Click on Server Configuration. 3.  Then click on Client Access. 4.  Make sure the Outlook Web Access tab is selected in the lower middle pane. 5.  Right-click on the virtual directory that we would like to edit  the default   Exchange 2007 virtual directory is  owa . 6.  Select Properties from the shortcut menu. 7.  Click on the Authentication tab. 8.  Ensure that Use forms-based authentication is selected. 9.  Click OK.  As we work our way through this process, we will see the following owa   Properties dialog:  [ 154 ]   Chapter 10  Switching to forms-based authentication will cause integrated Windows  authentication  e.g. https:  servername owa  or https:   servername exchange   to stop functioning. If you still need to use  integrated authentication for internal access, then an additional virtual  server will need to be created using Exchange System Manager to   allow this.  Integrating the My Tasks Web Part Once our Exchange Server is correctly configured, it is really very easy to add the  Exchange Web Parts to our site.  Let's add one of the Web Parts to a new page on our site. We will choose the My  Tasks Web Part to allow us to keep an eye on our task list:  1.  Open the share site. 2.  Create a new ASPX page called tasks.aspx. 3.  Click on the My Tasks Web Part and drag it onto our new page.  Once the Web Part has been added to the page, it will display the following text:  My Tasks: This Web Part does not have a preview mode when editing the page in  design view. Double-click on the Web Part and the My Tasks properties will be displayed so that  we can fill in the following properties:  1.  The Mail server address should be the OWA address. If your OWA access   is over a secure connection, then https must be specified in the address  e.g.  https:  mailserver exchange .  [ 155 ]   Integrating with Exchange  2.  Add your mailbox address  e.g. bob@malbet.local_or bob@winecompany. co.uk  to the Mailbox field. This will, of course, only work if that user has a  mailbox on the Exchange Server.  Once this is done, click OK. If you have specified reasonable-looking information,  then the properties window will disappear. If you have not, then the OK button will  gray out for a while and the window will remain open.  We can then go ahead and save the page, then open it in our favorite browser   provided that our favorite browser happens to be Internet Explorer 6 or later!  e.g.  http:  olmec share tasks.aspx.  Troubleshooting the Error Messages If you are using a secure connection to display your OWA data, then the chances are  that you will get the following error message when you try to view your web page:  Content was blocked because it was not signed by a valid security certificate. If you do get the message, then select the option to allow blocked content. This  message will appear every time you visit the page in a new browser session and will  appear for every Exchange Web Part that you have on the page  i.e. if you have three  inboxes displayed on the page, you will need to click to allow blocked content three  times, each time you open the browser .  [ 156 ]   Chapter 10  To permanently stop the content from being blocked, you will need to install an SSL  certificate on your Exchange Server. An explanation of this is outside of the remit  of this book. You will be able to find many helpful articles about how to do this by  typing create and install SSL certificate into your favorite search engine. You may also receive a message saying that cookies are disabled. If they are, then  you will need to enable them by going into your Internet Options. This can be   done in Internet Explorer 7 by going to Tools  Internet Options  Privacy  Sites,  then typing in the address of your domain  e.g. malbet.local  and clicking the  Allow button. If you get the following error message, then it most likely means that the mailbox  you have specified does exist but is not on the server that you have specified:  The specified Outlook Web Access Web Part URL contains an invalid value for the  view parameter. Once we have worked our way through these various error messages, then we  should be able to see our task list successfully embedded in our web page.  [ 157 ]   Integrating with Exchange  Summary In this chapter, we have witnessed the power of the ready-made tools that  SharePoint makes available to us. We learned how to use OWA Web Parts to  display our Exchange information in our SharePoint site and are now aware of  the configuration changes that are required to do so successfully and how to  troubleshoot any error messages that we may come across.  No doubt, you will be keen to embed your Exchange data into your applications, and  pleasantly surprised about how easy it is to do so.  [ 158 ]   Search Tools  It is well known that the amount of data in the world doubles very rapidly.   Estimates of the rate vary: once every three months, once a year, every two years,  or every three years. There is even a law predicting the growth, which is known  as "Reed's Law". One reason for the differing estimates is that they predict growth  for different types of data  business data, social networks, etc. . Whichever rate of  growth we choose, it is clear that the amount of data in the world is increasing at  a phenomenal rate. According to a study, by the University of California, Berkley,  there were five exabytes of new data created worldwide in 2002 alone. That is about  5,000,000,000 GB of information.  As the amount of data increases, the problem is not so much that we do not have the  information in our organization, it is more that it is difficult to find answers amongst  all the other information that we have.  A key requirement of any collaboration system is that it allows users to easily search  for the information they need so it is at their fingertips.  "Information overload" and "knowledge transfer" have been the focus of numerous  keynote speeches by Microsoft's top executives, over the past couple of years. So,  it comes as no surprise that SharePoint is no slouch when it comes to providing  powerful search tools. The improvements to the search capabilities in MOSS 2007  over its predecessor are numerous and include useful new functionality, such as  "Did you mean…" and the ability to search for people who have certain knowledge  or skills.  In this final chapter, we will examine the search tools we have at our disposal and  use them to add search capabilities to our site.   Search Tools  Federated Searching The power of SharePoint Enterprise Search is that it does not only query data stored  in one location but can pull data from a variety of sources, a technique known as  "federated searching".  When a user performs a search, different search engines are queried using the "Open  Search" standard. This allows various data sources including SharePoint sites,  desktops, line-of-business applications  e.g. Lotus Notes , and even users' brains to   be searched and the results displayed in one aggregated results list.  Don't worry about SharePoint searching our minds. This is not as scary  as it sounds and requires no brain implants. SharePoint's people search  merely identifies which brain the information is stored in and allows  the data to be retrieved in a traditional manner, such as a telephone  conversation or email exchange.  Search Web Parts It will come as no surprise that the key components that we will use to add search  functionality to our pages are available in the Web Part List. When we filter the  list to display the Search components, we have the choice of no fewer than eleven  different Search Web Parts that we can use in our applications.  [ 160 ]   The following Web Parts are available to us:  Chapter 11                         Advanced Search Box will display an extremely comprehensive search form,  which includes the ability for users to choose if they would like an exact  phrase to be found, to specify words that should not appear in the search  results, the type of documents they would like to search  e.g. Excel , and to  select the languages they would like to search. People Search Box does exactly as you would expect, allowing the user to  search for staff in our organization by name, department, title, and their  responsibilities, skills, or memberships. The results of the search can be  displayed in the People Search Core Results Web Part. A great feature of  this tool is that it can also make use of an employee's "social distance" within  the organization  i.e. a sales rep would not want to call up the CIO to ask  him to set up his mailbox . It is important to note that these Web Parts  and  the identical people search and employee lookup features in the default  SharePoint site  will not work straight out of the box. We must first define the  Active Directory from which we wish to import user profiles to allow people  search to work. Search Action Links allows the user to perform additional actions on the  search results. The main way that these action links are used is to allow the  user to sort the results by either relevance or by modified date. It is also  possible to use Search Action Links to create alerts based on the search  results or to view an RSS feed of the results. Search Best Bets provides a list of the top search results. Search Box is a lovely little component and is the simplest of the search  forms. It allows the user to specify the scope of their search  i.e. search our  site, all sites, or people  and to enter a simple keyword search. Search Core Results is the main results Web Part. By placing this Web Part  on our page, we can display the results of the search to the user. Search High Confidence Results will only display the results that SharePoint  thinks are very good matches  as opposed to the Search Best Bets Web Part,  which will display the top results no matter how good SharePoint thinks  they are . Search Paging allows the user to skip backwards and forwards between the  different pages of results.  [ 161 ]   Search Tools        Search Statistics is nothing to get too excited about. When I first heard  there was a Search Statistics Web Part, I immediately assumed that it would  display a report of the top searches that users were performing on the site.  Alas, it does not provide those types of statistics  there is a separate feature  known as the query report that allows you to do that . It will display the  number of results that are on the page, the total number of results, and the  time taken to complete the search. Search Summary displays a summary of the search query and can also  display a "Did You Mean…" feature, which second-guesses what the user  really wanted to search for. The summary can either be displayed in a  compact or an extended mode.  Using the Search Web Parts We will waste no time and create an example search. As we do so, you will see that  adding basic search capabilities to our site could not be simpler. For our example, we will use the Search Box Web Part to allow users to search our  site and the Search Core Results Web Part to display the results. Let's start off by creating a new ASPX page on our site called search.aspx. This   will be a simple page that will do nothing more than sending a query string to the  results page. Drag and drop the Search Box Web Part onto the page and then save the page. To  begin with, we will not set any of the properties for this Web Part.  Let's test our search page by opening it  e.g. http:  olmec share search.aspx  in  our web browser and typing in a search term  e.g. "birthday" . When we click on the  magnifying glass search button, the results are presented to us.  [ 162 ]   Notice that the search results have appeared in the default results page for our share  site without us needing to build a results page.  Chapter 11  By default, search results are displayed in either the site you are working in   when using the Search Box Web Part, e.g. http:  olmec share _layouts  OSSSearchResults.aspx  or in the Search Center  when using the Advanced Search  Box Web Part, e.g. http:  olmec searchcenter Pages results.aspx .  It is possible to create our own results page. To do this, we must first of all tell our  search form to point to the new results page that we will create:  1.  Right-click on the Search Box Web Part that we placed on our page and   select Web Part Properties… from the shortcut menu. This will open a dialog  with the title Search Box.  2.  Click on the plus sign to the left of the Miscellaneous title halfway down the   dialog to display the Miscellaneous options.  3.  Change the Target search results page URL to results.aspx. 4.  Click OK and then save the page.  [ 163 ]   Search Tools  Next, we will create a second ASPX page called results.aspx onto which we will  drag and drop the Search Core Results Web Part. When we have saved both our pages and repeat the search  making sure, of course,  that we have refreshed the search page in our browser so that it is using the latest  version , we will see the results displayed in our customized results page.  Hard-Coding Results When searching the site, notice how the keywords that we use are displayed in the  address bar on the results page. For example, when we search for birthday, we see  that the value birthday is displayed with the name k  for keyword  in the URL:  http:  olmec share results.aspx?k=birthday  Why is this good to know? Well, it opens up the possibilities when it comes to  providing users with pre-defined searches. If we would like to provide our users  with a basic way of searching for chardonnay, we may hard-code the following   URL into a link so that when the user clicks the link they are provided with  chardonnay results:  http:  olmec share results.aspx?k=chardonnay  This means that when we are displaying records in a grid view, we can program  SharePoint to display the results of a field  e.g. wine type  as hyperlinks, which will  use SharePoint Search to display the results.  [ 164 ]   Chapter 11  Other SharePoint Search Solutions Apart from building our own search pages in SharePoint with the controls it  provides, we can use solutions that Microsoft provides straight out of the box  or a  couple of boxes, in fact .  Search Center The most obvious of these search tools would be the Search Center that is built into  the default SharePoint site.  By default, the Search Center is available at http:  servername searchcenter    e.g. http:  olmec searchcenter  . When we open up our default SharePoint site   e.g. http:  olmec  , we can see the Search button on the menu bar that links to the  Search Center.  One of the beauties of the Search Center is that we can edit the appearance and  content of the page either with SharePoint Designer or by clicking on the Site  Actions button in the top right-hand corner of the Search Center and selecting   Edit Page. The other great thing about the Search Center is that the scope of searches includes  all SharePoint sites on the server. Many companies have separate sites for different  departments  HR, Finance, IT, etc. . The Search Center will provide results from all  these sites in one federated list.  Search Server 2008 The SharePoint Server for Search product has been rebranded as Microsoft Search  Server 2008  and the free Search Server 2008 Express version  and is available to  install separately from SharePoint Server so that you can benefit from the same search  functionality that exists in SharePoint Server on sites that do not use SharePoint.  Further details are available at http:  www.microsoft.com enterprisesearch .  [ 165 ]   Search Tools  Search Term Vocabulary If you are serious about implementing searching in your site, it might be useful to  take a moment to familiarize yourself with some terms used:           Noise words can be disabled or enabled in SharePoint. These are words that  add no meaning to the search  e.g. "the", "or", "a" . Stemming is where matches are also made on similar words based on the  stem of the word. This works particularly well with verbs  e.g. the stem "fly"  will bring up matches with "flying" and "flew" . Stemming is not enabled by  default in SharePoint but this can be configured. Soundex allows words with similar pronunciation to be grouped so that  when you search for a word  e.g. "Mike" , then similar sounding results  will be returned  e.g. "mic", "Michael", and "Michal" . Soundex is built into  Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and works by ignoring the vowels and converting  the remaining string into four-digit codes, which is then compared.  Soundex is not built into SharePoint server, but by adding some simple  SQL queries  e.g. SELECT * FROM tblPeople WHERE SOUNDEX 'Mike'  =  SOUNDEX firstname  , it is possible to add Soundex searches to our site.  While it is possible to create SharePoint searches using SQL queries, it  is outside the remit of this book. If you would like to write some code to  make use of SQL queries, then it is recommended that you investigate the  Microsoft.Sharepoint.Search.Query namespace.  Summary This brings us to the end of our chapter on using the search capabilities that  SharePoint provides us with. We have not only seen how to add search forms and  results lists to our pages but have also learned about the range of Search Web Parts  that are available to us.  As ever, I hope that you have been as impressed as I am with how easy SharePoint  makes it to create powerful applications. More than that though, I hope that you  have enjoyed not just this chapter but also the rest of the book and that it helps you  to understand and use SharePoint Designer.
