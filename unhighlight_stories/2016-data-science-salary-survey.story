Executive Summary  IN THIS FOURTH EDITION of the O’Reilly Data Science  Salary Survey, we’ve analyzed input from 983 respondents  working in the data space, across a variety of industries— representing 45 countries and 45 US states. Through the  results of our 64-question survey, we’ve explored which tools  data scientists, analysts, and engineers use, which tasks they  engage in, and of course—how much they make.   Key findings include:      Python and Spark are among the tools that contribute   most to salary.  who code the most.  tools.

The most salient division between tool and tasks usage   is between those who mostly use Excel, SQL, and a small  number of closed source tools—and those who use more  open source tools and spend more time coding.     R is used across this division: even people who don’t code   much or use many open source tools, use R.     A secondary division emerges among the coding half—  separating a younger, Python-heavy data scientist analyst  group, from a more experienced data scientist engineer  cohort that tends to use a high number of tools and earns  the highest salaries.     Those who attend more meetings, earn more.     Women make less than men, for doing the same thing.  To see our complete model and input your own metrics to  predict salary, see Appendix B  but beware—there’s a trans- formation involved: don’t forget to square the result! .  1   Introduction  FOR THE FOURTH YEAR RUNNING, we at O’Reilly Media  have collected survey data from data scientists, engineers, and  others in the data space, about their skills, tools, and salary.  Across our four years of data, many key trends are more or less  constant: median salaries, top tools, and correlations among  tool usage. For this year’s analysis, we collected responses from  September 2015 to June 2016, from 983 data professionals.  In this report, we provide some different approaches to the  analysis, in particular conducting clustering on the respon- dents  not just tools . We have also adjusted the linear model  for improved accuracy, using a square root transform and  publicly available data on geographical variation in economies.  The survey itself also included new questions, most notably  about specific data-related tasks and any change in salary.   Salary: The Big Picture The median base salary of the entire sample was $87K. This  figure is slightly lower than in previous years  last year it  was $91K , but this discrepancy is fully attributable to shifts  in demographics: this year’s sample had a higher share of   non-US respondents and respondents aged 30 or younger.  Three-fifths of the sample came from the US, and these  respondents had a median salary of $106K.   Understanding Interquartile Range For a number of survey questions, we show graphs of answer  shares and the median salaries of respondents who gave  particular answers. While median salary is probably the best  number to compare how much two groups of people make, it  doesn’t say anything about the spread or variation of salaries.  In addition to median, we also show the interquartile range   IQR —two numbers that delineate salaries of the middle  50%. This range is not a confidence interval, nor is it based  on standard deviations.  As an example, the IQR for US respondents was $80K to  $138K, meaning one quarter of US respondents had salaries  lower than $80K and one quarter had salaries higher than  $138K. Perhaps more illustrative of the value of the IQR is  comparing the US Northeast and Midwest: the Northeast has  a higher median salary  $105K vs. $98K  but the third quartile   2   BASE SALARY         Share of Respondents    S R A L L O D S U     l        y r a a S e s a B     0K  20K  40K  60K  80K  100K  120K  140K  160K  180K  200K  >200K  0  5%  10%  15%  Share of respondents   cutoffs are $133K for the Northeast and $138K for the Mid- west. This indicates that there is generally more variation in  Midwest salaries, and that among top earners—salaries might  be even higher in the Midwest than in the Northeast.   YEARS OF EXPERIENCE   in your field   SHARE OF RESPONDENTS  < 5 YEARS  5 - 8 YEARS  22%  42%  How Salaries Change We also collected data on salary change over the last three  years. About half of the sample reported a 20% change, and  12% the salary of 12% of the sample doubled. We attempted to  model salary change with other variables from the survey,  9 -12 YEARS but the model performed much more poorly, with an R2  of just 0.221. Many of the same significant features in the  salary regression model also appeared as factors in predicted  salary change: Spark Unix, high meeting hours, high coding  hours, and building  prototype models, all  predict higher salary  growth, while using  Excel, gender dispar- ity, and working at  an older company  predict lower salary  growth. Geogra- phy also correlated  positively with salary  change, meaning that   SHARE OF RESPONDENTS  14%  NEGATIVE CHANGE  5%  5%  NO CHANGE  NA  SALARY WAS ZERO   4  in places with stronger economies, wages are less likely to  stagnate.   SALARY MEDIAN AND IQR  US DOLLARS   Assessing Your Salary To use the model for you own salary, refer to the full model in  Appendix B, and add up the coefficients that apply to you.  Once all of the constants are added, square the result for a  final salary estimate  note: the coefficients are not in dollars .  The contribution of a particular coefficient to the eventual  salary estimate depends on the other coefficients: the higher  the salary, the higher the contribution of each coefficient.   < 5 5 to 8 9 to 12 13 to 16 17 to 20 > 20  s r a e Y  17 - 20 YEARS  0  For example, the salary difference between a junior data sci- entist and a senior architect will be greater in a country with  2% high salaries than somewhere with lower salaries.  > 20 YEARS  Range Median  200K  100K  150K  50K  10%  13 - 16 YEARS  3%  11%  +0% TO +10%  13%  +10% TO +20%  7%  +75% TO +100%   DOUBLE   6%  +100% TO +200%   TRIPLE   6%  OVER TRIPLE  8%  +20% TO +30%  8%  +30% TO +40%  9%  +50% TO +75%  8%  +40% TO +50%  PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN SALARY OVER LAST THREE YEARS   Factors that Influence Salary:  The Regression Model  WE HAVE INCLUDED OUR FULL regression model in  Appendix B. For this year’s report, we have made two  important changes to the basic, parsimonious linear model we  presented in the 2015 report. We have included: 1  external  geographic data  GDP by US state and country , and 2  a  square root transformation. The transformation adds one step  to the linear model: we add up model coefficients, and then  square the result. Both of these changes significantly improve  the accuracy in salary estimates.  Our model explains about three-quarters of the variance in  the sample salaries  with an R2 of 0.747 . Roughly half of the  salary variance is due to geography and experience. Given the  important factors that can not be captured in the survey— for example, we don’t measure competence or evaluate the  quality of respondents’ work output—it’s not surprising that a  large amount of variance is left unexplained.    Impact of Geography Geography has a huge impact on salary, but is not adequately  captured due to sample size. For example, if a country is repre-  sented by only one or two respondents, this isn’t enough to jus- tify giving the country its own coefficient. For this reason, we use  broad regional coefficients  e.g., “Asia” or “Eastern Europe” ,  keeping in mind however that economic differences within a  region are huge, and thus the accuracy of the model suffers.   To get around this problem, we’ve used publicly available  records of per capita GDP of countries and US states. While  GDP itself doesn’t translate to salary, it can serve a proxy  function for geographic salary variation. Note that we use  per capita GDP on the state and country level; therefore the  model is likely to produce an inaccurate estimate with GDP  figures for smaller geographic units.  Two exceptions were made to the GDP data before incorporat- ing it into the model. The per capita GDP of Washington DC  is $181K—much greater than in neighboring Virginia  $57K   and Maryland  $60K . Many  if not most  data science jobs in  Maryland and Virginia are actually in the greater DC metropoli- tan area, and the survey data suggest that average data science  salaries in these three places are not radically different from  each other. Using the true $181K figure would produce gross   5   WORLD REGION  3%  CANADA  61%  UNITED STATES  SHARE OF RESPONDENTS  8%  UK IRELAND  15%  EUROPE  EXCEPT UK I   8%  ASIA  2%  LATIN AMERICA  1%  AFRICA   SALARY MEDIAN AND IQRC  US DOLLARS   United States Europe  except UK I  Asia UK Ireland Canada Australia NZ Latin America Africa  2%  AUSTRALIA NZ  i  n o g e R  *The interquartile range  IQR   is the middle 50% of respondents' salaries.

The other exception is California. In all of the salary surveys we  have conducted, California has had the highest median salary  of any state or country, even though its per capita GDP  $62K   is not ranked so high  nine states have higher per capita GDPs,  as do two countries that were represented in the sample,  Switzerland and Norway . The anomaly is likely due to the San  Francisco Bay Area, where, depending on how the region is  defined, per capita GDP is $80K–$90K. As a major tech center,  the Bay Area is likely overrepresented in the sample, meaning  that the geographic factor attributable to California should be  pushed upward; an appropriate compromise was $70K.   Considering Gender There is a difference of $10K between the median salaries of  men and women. Keeping all other variables constant—same  roles, same skills—women make less than men.   Age, Experience, and Industry Experience and age are two important variables that influence  salary. The coefficient for experience  +3.8  translates to an  increase of $2K–$2.5K on average, per year of experience. As  for age, the biggest jump is between people in their early and  late 20s, but the difference between those aged 31–65 and  those over 65 is also significant.   8  We also asked respondents to rate their bargaining skills on  a scale of 1 to 5, and those who gave higher self-evalua- tions tended to have higher salaries. The difference in salary  between two data scientists, one with a bargaining skill “1”  and the other with “5”, with otherwise identical demograph- ics and skills, is expected to be $10K–$15K.   Finally, in terms of work-life balance, our results show that  once you are working beyond 60 hours, salary estimates  actually go down.

The task with the greatest impact on salary  i.e., the greatest  coefficient  was developing prototype models. Respondents  who indicated major engagement with this task received  on average a $7.4K boost, based on our model. Even minor  engagement in developing prototype models had a +4.4  coefficient.   Relevance of Job Titles When both tasks and job titles are included in the training  set, job title “wins” as a better predictor of salary. It’s notable  however, that titles themselves are not necessarily accurate  at describing what people do. For example, even among  architects there was only a 70% rate of major engagement  in planning large software projects—a task that theoretically  defines the role. Since job title does perform well as a salary  predictor, despite this inconsistency, it may be that “architect,”  for example, is a symbol of seniority as much as anything else.   Respondents with “upper management” titles—mostly C-level  executives at smaller companies, directors and VPs—had a  huge coefficient of +20.2. Engagement in tasks associated  with managerial roles also had a positive impact on salary,  namely: organizing team projects  +9.7 , identifying business  problems to be solved with analytics  +1.5 +6.7 , and commu- nicating with people outside the company  +5.4 .   16   JOB TITLE  8%  MANAGER  11%  OTHER  9%  ENGINEER  DEVELOPER  PROGRAMMER  11%  UPPER MANAGEMENT  3%  3% PRINCIPAL   LEAD 3%  4% RESEARCHER  CONSULTANT  ARCHITECT  2%  SENIOR ENGINEER   DEVELOPER  SALARY MEDIAN AND IQR  US DOLLARS   Data Scientist Upper Management Engineer   Developer   Programmer Other Manager Consultant Researcher Principal   Lead Architect Senior Engineer   Developer  e l t i T b o J     45%  DATA SCIENTIST  0  50K  100K  150K  200K  Range Median  SHARE OF RESPONDENTS   TASKS   major involvement only   39%  ORGANIZING  AND GUIDING  TEAM PROJECTS  36%  IMPLEMENTING MODELS                       ALGORITHMS  INTO PRODUCTION  43%  DEVELOPING  PROTOTYPE MODELS  43%  FEATURE EXTRACTION  32%  COLLABORATING ON CODE  PROJECTS  READING EDITING  OTHERS' CODE, USING GIT   47%  IDENTIFYING BUSINESS  PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED  WITH ANALYTICS  49%  CREATING  VISUALIZATIONS  53%  DATA CLEANING  58%  COMMUNICATING FINDINGS  TO BUSINESS DECISION-MAKERS  61%  CONDUCTING DATA  ANALYSIS TO ANSWER  RESEARCH QUESTIONS  PLANNING LARGE SOFTWARE PROJECTS OR DATA SYSTEMS  TEACHING TRAINING OTHERS  31%  30%  30%  DEVELOPING DASHBOARDS  28%  COMMUNICATING WITH PEOPLE  OUTSIDE YOUR COMPANY  29%  ETL  20%  DEVELOPING DATA  ANALYTICS SOFTWARE  24%  SETTING UP   MAINTAINING  DATA PLATFORMS  19%  DEVELOPING PRODUCTS THAT DEPEND  ON REAL-TIME DATA ANALYTICS  19%  USING DASHBOARDS AND SPREADSHEETS   MADE BY OTHERS  TO MAKE DECISIONS  DEVELOPING HARDWARE  OR WORKING ON SOFTWARE PROJECTS  THAT REQUIRE EXPERT KNOWLEDGE OF HARDWARE   69%  BASIC EXPLORATORY  DATA ANALYSIS  5%   Basic exploratory data analysis Conducting data analysis to answer research questions Communicating findings to business decision-makers Data cleaning Creating visualizations Identifying business problems to be solved with analytics Feature extraction Developing prototype models Organizing and guiding team projects Implementing models   algorithms into production Collaborating on code projects  reading   editing others' code, using git  Teaching   training others Planning large software projects or data systems Developing dashboards ETL Communicating with people outside your company Setting up   maintaining data platforms Developing data analytics software Developing products that depend on real-time data analytics Using dashboards and spreadsheets  made by others  to make decisions Developing hardware  or working on software projects that require expert knowledge of hardware   k s a T  30K  60K  90K  120K  150K  Range Median   2016 DATA SCIENCE SALARY SURVEY  Time Spent in Meetings People who spend more time in meetings tend to make more.  This is the variable we often use as a reminder that the model  does not guarantee that the relationships between significant  variables and salary are causative: if someone starts schedul- ing many meetings  and doesn’t change anything else in their  workday  it is unlikely that this will lead to anything positive,  much less a raise*.   Role of Coding The highest median salaries belong to those who code 4–8  hours per week; the lowest to those who don’t code at all.  Notably, only 8% of the sample reported that they don’t  code at all, significantly down from last year’s 20%. Coding is  clearly an integral part of being a data scientist.  *  Of course, we haven’t actually tested this.

The most commonly  used tools  except for operating systems  were included in  the model training data as individual coefficients; of these,  Python, JavaScript, and Excel had significant coefficients:  +4.6, –2.2 and –7.4, respectively. Less commonly used tools  were first grouped together into clusters and aggregate  features were included that represent counts of tools used   22  from each cluster. For five clusters that were found to have a  significant correlation with salary, coefficients are added on a  per-tool basis*.   The cluster with the largest coefficient was centered on Spark  and Unix, contributing +3.9 per tool. Spark usage was 20%,  up from last year’s a modest 3%, and it continues to be used  by the more well paid individuals in the sample.   In contrast to the largely open source Spark Unix cluster, the  second highest cluster coefficient  +2.4  was assigned to a  cluster dominated by proprietary software: Tableau, Teradata,  Netezza, Microstrategy, Aster Data, and Jaspersoft. In last  year’s report, Teradata also featured as a tool with a large,  positive coefficient. The other three clusters with significant  coefficients mostly consisted of open source data tools.   *  Tools are added up to a maximum number. This is because few respondents   had more than that number of tools from the cluster, and so if someone  uses more, there is no evidence to support continued addition of coeffi- cients.    Which Tools to Add to Your Stack While the model we’ve explained is a good way to get an esti- mate for how much someone earns given a certain tool stack, it  doesn’t necessarily work as a good guide for which tool to learn  next. The real question is whether a tool is useful for getting  done what you need to get done. If you never have to analyze  more data than can fit into memory on your local machine, you  might not get any benefit—much less a salary boost—by using  a tool that leverages distributed systems, for example.   Salary and Sequences of Tools In the following sequences of tools, the next tool in the  sequence was frequently used by respondents who used all  earlier tools, and these sequences had the best salary differen- tials at each step.  If you know the first tool in a sequence, you might consider  learning the second, and so on.

While it is  easier—and more common—to classify roles based on titles,  clustering based on tools and tasks is a more rigorous way to  define the key divisions between respondents of the survey.  Every respondent is assigned to one of four clusters based on  their tools and tasks*.  The four clusters were not evenly populated: their shares of  the survey sample were 29%, 31%, 23%, and 17%, respec- tively. They can be described as shown on the right.              Cluster 1   Analysts and data scientists with very small  tool stacks, as well as programmers and  developers who aren’t data scientists; this  functions as a miscellaneous category  Cluster 2   Analysts and engineers who use  many Microsoft tools  Cluster 3   Coding analysts and data  scientists, Python-dominant  Cluster 4   Data engineers and architects who use  many different tools, largely open-source  A selection of tool and task percentages are described in the  sections that follow, and the full profiles of tool task percent- ages are found in Appendix A.  *  We tried a variety of clustering algorithms with various numbers of clusters,   and the two best performing models came from KMeans, with two and  four clusters. The partition in the 2-cluster model is more or less preserved  in the 4-cluster model, so we will use the latter, keeping in mind that there  is a primary split between the first two and last two clusters.  31   Operating Systems In our three previous Data Science Salary Survey reports, the  clearest division in tool clusters separated one group of open  source, usually GUI-less tools, from another consisting of  proprietary software, largely developed by Microsoft. Com- mon tools in the open source group have been Linux, Python,  Spark, Hadoop, and Java, and common tools in the Microsoft  closed source group include Windows, Excel, Visual Basic, and  MS SQL Server. This same division appears when we cluster   respondents, and is clearest when we look at the usage of  operating systems:  Cluster Windows Linux Mac OS X  1  86% 37% 26%  2  92% 21% 23%  3  48% 70% 70%  4  55% 91% 67%  OPERATING SYSTEMS  Respondents could choose more than one OS   SHARE OF RESPONDENTS  74%  WINDOWS  49%  LINUX  32 COMPANY AGE  SHARE OF RESPONDENTS  Windows Linux Mac OS X Unix iOS  as a developer  Android  as a developer   42%  MAC OS X  18% 2%  UNIX  IOS  as a developer   2%  ANDROID  as a developer   SALARY MEDIAN AND IQR  US DOLLARS   S O  0  30K  120K  150K  90K  60K Range Median   A set of tasks also emphasize the division between the first  two and last two clusters. The following percentages repre- sent respondents who indicated major engagement in these  tasks:  Cluster  Feature extraction Collaborating on code  projects Developing prototype  models Implementing models  algorithms  1 11% 23%  2 41% 18%  3  74% 41%  4 61% 59%  19%  34% 64% 72%  17%  32% 46% 60%  For all of the above tasks, the top two percentages were held  by clusters 3 or 4 and were both much higher than either  percentage for clusters 1 and 2.   Python, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn  Another set of tools that exposed the primary split between  clusters 1 2 and 3 4 are Python and two of its popular  packages, Matplotlib  for visualization  and Scikit-Learn  for  machine learning :  Cluster  Python Scikit-learn  Matplotlib  1  27% 7% 5%  2  32% 7% 5%  3  96% 73% 67%  4  84% 57% 42%  Survey respondents assigned to clusters 3 and 4 tend to use  Python much more than those assigned to 1 and 2, and the  relative difference  as a ratio  grows when we look at the two  packages: cluster 3 and 4 respondents are 8–10 times as likely  to use them as cluster 1 and 2 respondents. Between clus- ters 3 and 4 there is a difference as well, albeit more minor:  cluster 3 has a higher Python usage rate, while a larger share  of cluster 4 respondents don’t use Python or these packages.  It turns out that these are the only tools whose highest usage  rate is among cluster 3 respondents*. For most other tools  that are used much more frequently by clusters 3 and 4 than  by 1 and 2, they are also used more frequently by cluster 4  than by cluster 3.   Cluster  MySQL  Bash PostgreSQL Spark Hive Java Apache Hadoop D3  1  26% 9% 11% 9% 11% 16% 5% 5%  2  33% 7% 12% 6% 13% 8% 6% 6%  3 41% 42% 26% 20% 23% 14% 18% 20%  4  57% 58% 53% 69% 46% 44% 55% 49%  *  Excluding tools that didn’t have a significant difference between the top   two percentages: Mac OS X, ggplot, Vertica, and Stata.   33   Cluster  ElasticSearch Scala Kafka  1 5% 3% 3%  2 3% 1% 1%  3 9% 6% 4%  4  33% 34% 28%  Cluster 4 rates for two tasks also stand out:   Cluster  1  2  3  4  20% 28% 30% 47% 22% 22% 19% 40%  27% 21% 23% 63%  ETL Setting up maintaining  data platforms Planning large SW projects  data systems  Cluster 4, it seems, is much more of an “open source data  engineer” descriptor than cluster 3, which heads in that  direction but not nearly to the same extent. It’s not rare for  cluster 3 respondents to have used these tools—86% of them  used at least one—but on average they only used about 2.2.  In comparison, respondents in cluster 4 used an average of  5.3 tools. The fact that ETL and data management are much  more important in cluster 4 than cluster 3, implies that while  both might represent data science, cluster 3 tends toward   the analyst’s side of the field, and cluster 4 tends toward the  engineering or architecture side.   As for the other two clusters, differences between clusters 1  and 2 become apparent once we look at the rest of the afore- mentioned proprietary tool set. Cluster 2 respondents tended  to use these much more frequently.  For most of tools shown below, cluster 1 has the second  highest usage rate, but they significantly lag behind those of  cluster 2. Cluster 1 respondents tended to use fewer tools in  general: just under 8 on average, compared to 10, 13, and 21  for the three other clusters, respectively.   Cluster  Microsoft SQL  Server Visual Basic VBA PowerPivot Power BI QlikView BusinessObjects Cognos SAS  1  32%  11% 10% 7% 6% 5% 6% 6%  2 51%  24% 19% 14% 12% 13% 10% 9%  3 17%  6% 2% 2% 2% 1% 0% 2%  4  27%  5% 2% 6% 7% 4% 5% 1%  34   Tasks Without Coding There are also some tasks that are undertaken by cluster 2  respondents significantly more frequently than those in other  clusters:  Creating visualizations Data analysis to answer  research questions Developing dashboards  Cluster  1  2  3  4  17% 78% 56% 42% 24% 84% 75% 63%  13% 54% 18% 33%  The first two tasks are functions of an analyst, and are  fairly common among cluster 3 and 4 respondents as well.   Crucially, none of these tasks depend on being able to code   at least, not as much as the four tasks above that are closely  associated with clusters 3 and 4 . The low percentages for  cluster 1 sheds some light on the nature of this cluster: most  respondents in the sample whose primary function is not as a  data scientist, analyst, or manager seem to be grouped there.  This includes programmers who aren’t deep in the space  e.g.,  Java programmers who only use a few data tools . There are  analysts and data scientists in cluster 1, but they tend to have  small tool sets, and the composite feature of non-participation   in many data tasks and non-use of data tools is what binds  cluster 1 together.   Some of the proprietary tools listed above are used by respon- dents in cluster 4 about as much as those in cluster 1, most  notably SQL Server. In other words, they begin to violate the  primary cluster 1 2 vs. 3 4 split. A few other tools and tasks  take this pattern even further, or simply don’t show large  usage differences between clusters:   Cluster  Excel SQL R Tableau Oracle Teradata Oracle BI  1  66% 62% 30% 17% 22% 6% 4%  2  84% 75% 69% 56% 31% 13% 6%  3  59% 65% 67% 21% 10% 8% 1%  4  60% 80% 69% 37% 30% 13% 8%  Cluster  Data cleaning  Basic exploratory data  analysis  1  3  2  4 23% 62% 72% 61% 32% 88% 92% 63%  35   Tableau, Oracle, Teradata, and Oracle BI usage is higher in  clusters 2 and 4, lower in clusters 1 and 3. The same is true  for SQL, but like Excel and R, it’s exceptional in its wide usage  across all four clusters. In fact, SQL and Excel are the only two  tools  or tasks  that are used by over half of the respondents  in each cluster. R is not used as much by cluster 1, but usage  among the other three clusters is about the same: 67%– 69%. Data cleaning and basic exploratory analysis are similarly  high for clusters 2, 3, and 4, and much lower for cluster 1.  These tasks and tools cut across the cluster boundaries, and  don’t seem to have much correlation with the more salient  tool task differences.   Managerial and Business Strategy Tasks Perhaps even more illustrative of the connection between  clusters 2 and 4 are the managerial business strategy tasks.  The implication is that respondents in 2 4 tend to be more  senior, which turns out to be true, but only to an extent. In  terms of years of experience, clusters 1, 2, and 4 are about  the same—8–9 years on average—while for the cluster 3, the  average is much smaller: only 4.4 years; a similar difference  exists for age.   Despite representing the least experienced cohort, cluster 3  isn’t the lowest paid; that distinction goes to cluster 1, with  a median salary of $72K. At $84K, cluster 3 is still lower than  cluster 2  $88K , but cluster 4 salaries tended to be far higher  than either, with a median of $112K. Cluster 4 respondents  tend to use a far greater number of tools than respondents  in the other clusters, and many of the tools they commonly  use are ones that had positive coefficients in the regression  model.

For example, someone might work for a company with  a colossal budget that can afford high salaries and expensive  tools, but this doesn’t mean that their high salary is driven up  by their tool choice.   Of course, it’s not so simple with salary. When tools become  industry standards, employers begin to expect them, and it  can hurt your chances of landing a good job if you are missing  key tools: it’s in your interest to keep up with new technology.  If you apply for a job at a company that is clearly interested  in hiring someone who knows a certain tool, and this tool is  used by people who earn high salaries, then you have lever-  age knowing that it will be hard for them to find an alterna- tive hire without paying a premium.   This information isn’t just for the employees, either. Business  leaders choosing technologies need to consider not just the  software costs, but labor expenses as well. We hope that the  information in this report will aid the task of building esti- mates for such decisions.   If you made use of this report, please consider taking the  2017 survey. Every year we work to build on the last year’s  report, and much of the improvement comes from increased  sample sizes. This is a joint research effort, and the more  interaction we have with you, the deeper we will be able to  explore the data science space. Thank you!   37   Appendix A: Full Cluster Profiles  Cluster  Cluster  1  86% 62% 66% 30% 27% 37% 26% 26% 13% 32%  17% 7% 5% 22% 9% 11% 9%  2  92% 75% 84% 69% 32% 21% 23% 33% 33% 51%  56% 7% 5% 31% 7% 12% 6%  3  48% 65% 59% 67% 96% 70% 70% 41% 53% 17%  21% 73% 67% 10% 42% 26% 20%  4  55% 80% 60% 69% 84% 91% 67% 57% 52% 27%  37% 57% 42% 30% 58% 53% 69%  Tools Hive Java Unix JavaScript Apache Hadoop    Shiny D3 Spark MlLib Visual Basic VBA Cloudera SQLite Redshift MongoDB ElasticSearch Teradata PowerPivot C++ Weka  1 11% 16% 10% 12% 5% 5% 5% 2% 11% 6% 7% 5% 4% 5% 6% 10% 7% 5%  2 13% 8% 12% 8% 6% 19% 6% 3% 24% 8% 4% 7% 5% 3% 13% 19% 3% 5%  3  23% 14% 21% 18% 18% 21% 20% 14% 6% 11% 15% 10% 15% 9% 8% 2% 13% 8%  4  46% 44% 36% 39% 55% 27% 49% 49% 5% 30% 24% 21% 24% 33% 13% 2% 17% 25%  Tools Windows SQL Excel R Python Linux Mac OS X MySQL ggplot Microsoft SQL  Server Tableau Scikit-learn Matplotlib Oracle Bash PostgreSQL Spark  38   Cluster  Cluster  Tools Matlab Google Charts   Scala C Hortonworks Power BI   QlikView C Amazon Elastic  MapReduce   EMR  Hbase Kafka Pig BusinessObjects Bokeh Cognos Impala  1 5% 6% 3% 6% 8% 7% 6% 10% 3%  4% 3% 3% 5% 1% 6% 1%  2 5% 7% 1% 3% 4% 14% 12% 8% 2%  3% 1% 4% 13% 1% 10% 4%  3 12% 6% 6% 11% 6% 2% 2% 4% 9%  4% 4% 5% 1% 14% 0% 7%  4 16% 19% 34% 16% 17% 6% 7% 7% 22%  26% 28% 20% 4% 15% 5% 14%  Tools SAS Perl IBM DB2 H2O Solr Toad Oracle BI Vertica Cassandra Netezza  IBM  Lucene Spotfire RapidMiner Zookeeper LIBSVM Redis MapR Neo4J  1 6% 5% 5% 1% 3% 5% 4% 4% 1% 2% 2% 2% 2% 1% 2% 1% 2% 1%  2 9% 3% 8% 3% 1% 8% 6% 4% 2% 7% 1% 8% 5% 2% 1% 0% 5% 2%  3 2% 5% 2% 6% 4% 0% 1% 6% 2% 2% 2% 2% 2% 2% 5% 3% 1% 3%  4 1% 10% 5% 13% 16% 3% 8% 5% 19% 5% 16% 3% 7% 14% 10% 17% 8% 11%  39   1 2% 1%  2% 1% 2% 1% 2% 1% 3% 1%  1% 1% 2% 0% 2% 0%  Tools Splunk Google BigQuery  Fusion Tables EMC Greenplum Mahout Ruby Mathematica Pentaho Adobe Analytics Microstrategy Amazon   DynamoDB Octave Storm Stata Vowpal Wabbit KNIME Dato GraphLab  40  Cluster  Cluster  2 3% 2%  1% 1% 1% 2% 2% 6% 4% 1%  1% 1% 3% 1% 3% 1%  3 3% 3%  1% 1% 2% 4% 2% 1% 0% 3%  2% 0% 3% 2% 1% 2%  4 7% 10%  7% 13% 8% 6% 6% 1% 2% 8%  7% 11% 2% 8% 4% 9%  Tools IBM Big Insights Alteryx Aster Data    Teradata  iOS    as a developer  Android    as a developer  SAP HANA JavaScript InfoVis  Toolkit Processing BigML Go Oracle Exascale Datameer Jaspersoft Couchbase Google Prediction  1 1% 1% 2%  2%  3%  1% 1%  1% 0% 0% 1% 1% 1% 1% 1%  2 3% 5% 3%  2%  1%  3% 1%  0% 1% 0% 1% 2% 1% 0% 1%  3 0% 0% 0%  1%  0%  1% 0%  2% 0% 1% 0% 0% 1% 0% 0%  4 4% 1% 2%  3%  2%  1% 5%  2% 4% 5% 2% 1% 1% 3% 3%   Tasks ETL Data cleaning Feature extraction Basic exploratory data analysis Creating visualizations Setting up maintaining data platforms Conducting data analysis to answer research questions Collaborating on code projects Planning large SW projects data systems Developing prototype models Implementing models algorithms into production Developing data analytics software Developing products that depend on real-time data analytics Developing dashboards Teaching training others Organizing and guiding team projects Using dashboards and spreadsheets  made by others  to  make decisions Identifying business problems to be solved with analytics Communicating findings to business decision-makers Communicating with people outside your company Developing hardware  1  20% 23% 11% 32% 17% 22% 24% 23% 27% 19% 17% 9% 10% 13% 15% 25% 13%  16% 23% 18% 5%  Cluster  2  28% 62% 41% 88% 78% 22% 84% 18% 21% 34% 32% 13% 18% 54% 41% 50% 33%  75% 87% 42% 4%  3  30% 72% 74% 92% 56% 19% 75% 41% 23% 64% 46% 26% 19% 18% 22% 20% 8%  34% 49% 17% 4%  4  47% 61% 61% 64% 42% 40% 63% 59% 63% 72% 60% 43% 36% 33% 49% 67% 18%  65% 78% 37% 10%  41   Appendix B: The Regression Model    +60.0  Constant: everyone starts with this number  -24.5   industry = Education  +2.6    Multiply by per capita GDP, in thousands  e.g., for  Iowa, 2.6 * 52.8 = 137.28   -3.9   industry = Computers Hardware  +7.1   industry = Search Social Networking  -7.8  gender = Female  +3.8  Per year of experience  +7.4  Per bargaining skill “point”    +17.2  Age: 26 to 30    +22.5  Age: 31 to 35    +24.8  Age: 36 to 65    +38.5  Age: over 65  +3.9    Academic speciality is was mathematics, statistics  or physics    +12.2  PhD  -9.7  Currently a student  full- or part-time, any level   +2.2   industry = Software  incl.
