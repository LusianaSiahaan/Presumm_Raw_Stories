There are several excellent guides  about the practical steps for creating and managing metadata. This book is intended as a tutorial on metadata and arose from my own need to find out more about how metadata worked and its uses. The original book  came  out  at  a  time  when  there  were  very  few  guides  of  this  type available. Metadata Fundamentals for All Librarians provided a good starting point which introduced the basic concepts and identified some of the main standards that were then available  Caplan, 2003 . It was an early publication from a period of tremendous development and in an area that was changing day  to  day.  Introduction  to  Metadata,  published  by  the  Getty  Institute, represented  another  milestone  and  provided  more  comprehensive background to metadata  Baca, 1998 . It is now in its third edition  Baca, 2016 . In my work as an information management consultant many colleagues and clients kept asking the questions: ‘What is metadata?’, ‘How does it work?’, and ‘What’s it for?’. The last of these questions particularly resonated with  the  analysis  and  review  of  information  services.  This  led  to  the development of a view of metadata defined by its purposes or uses. Since the first edition of Metadata for Information Management and Retrieval there have been many excellent additions to the literature, notably Zeng and Qin’s book, simply entitled Metadata, which is now in its second edition  Zeng and Qin, 2008; 2015; Haynes, 2004 . I also enjoyed Philip Hider’s book, Information Resource Description, which is substantially about metadata from a subject retrieval perspective  Hider, 2012 . There are many other excellent tomes, some of which are mentioned in the main body of this book. I hope that this second edition adds a unique perspective to this burgeoning field.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page xii  XII METADATA FOR INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND RETRIEVAL  This book covers the basic concepts of metadata and some of the models that are used for describing and handling it. The main purpose of this book is to reveal how metadata operates, from the perspective of the user and the manager.  It  is  primarily  concerned  with  data  about  document-based information content – in the broadest sense. Many of the examples will be for bibliographic  materials  such  as  books,  e-journals  and  journal  articles. However, this book also covers metadata about the documentation associated with museum objects  thus making them information objects , as well as digital resources such as research data collections, web resources, digitised images, digital photographs, electronic records, music, sound recordings and moving images. It is not a book about databases or data modelling, which is covered elsewhere  Hay, 2006 .  Metadata  for  Information  Management  and  Retrieval is  international  in coverage and sets out to introduce the concepts behind metadata.  It focuses on  the  ways  metadata  is  used  to  manage  and  retrieve  information.    It discusses the role of metadata in information governance as well as exploring its use in the context of social media, linked open data and big data.  The book is  intended  for  museums,  libraries,  archives  and  records  management professionals,  including  academic  libraries,  publishers,  and  managers  of institutional repositories and research data sets.  It will be directly relevant to students in the iSchools as well as those who are preparing to work in the library and information professions.  It will be of particular interest to the knowledge organisation and information architecture communities.  Managers of corporate information resources and informed users who need to know about metadata will also find much that is relevant to them.  Finally, this book is for researchers who deal with large data sets, either as their creators or as users who need to understand the ways in which that data is described, its properties and ways of handling and interrogating that data.

I hope that they will recognise their contributions in this book and will accept this acknowledgement as thanks. Any shortcomings are entirely my own.  I would like to thank colleagues at City, University of London. David Bawden and Lyn Robinson at the Centre for Information Science provided guidance and encouragement throughout. Andy MacFarlane was an excellent critic for the early drafts of the chapter on information retrieval. The library service at City, University of London has been an invaluable resource which, with the back-up of the British Library, has been essential for the identification and procurement of relevant literature.  Neil Wilson, Rachael Kotarski, Bill Stockting and Paul Clements at the British Library, Christopher Hilton at the Wellcome Library and Graham Bell of EDItEUR all freely gave their time in interviews and follow-up questions. I would like to acknowledge the contribution made by former colleagues at CILIP, where I was working when I wrote the first edition. I am also grateful for the feedback from reviewers, colleagues and students who have used the book as a text. I am especially grateful for the moral support of the University of Dundee, where I teach a module on ‘Metadata Standards and Information  Taxonomies’  on  their  postgraduate  course  in  the  Centre  for Archives and Information Studies  CAIS . Teaching that particular course has helped to shape my thinking and has given me an incentive to read and think more about metadata.  Many colleagues in the wider library and information profession helped to clarify specific points about the use of metadata. I would especially like to   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page xiv  XIV METADATA FOR INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND RETRIEVAL  thank Gordon Dunsire for going through the manuscript and pointing out significant issues that I hope have now been addressed.   Finally I would like to thank family, friends and colleagues who have  provided constant encouragement throughout this enterprise.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 1  PART I Metadata concepts Part  I  introduces  the  concepts  that  underpin  metadata,  starting  with  an historical perspective. Some examples of metadata that people come across in their daily life are demonstrated in Chapter 1, along with some alternative views of metadata and how it might be categorised. This chapter defines the scope  of  this  book  as  considering  metadata  in  the  context  of  document description. Chapter 2 looks at mark-up languages and the development of schemas as a way of representing metadata standards. It also highlights the connection between metadata and cataloguing. Chapter 3 looks at different ways of modelling data with specific reference to the Resource Description Framework  RDF . It describes the Library Reference Model  LRM  and its impact on current cataloguing systems. Chapter 4 discusses cataloguing and metadata standards and ways of representing metadata. It introduces RDA, MARC, BIBFRAME as well as standards used in records management, digital repositories and non-textual materials such as images, video and sound.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 2   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 3  CHAPTER 1 Introduction  Overview This chapter sets out to introduce the concepts behind metadata and illustrate  them with historical examples of metadata use. Some of these uses predate the term ‘metadata’. The development of metadata is placed in the context of the history of cataloguing, as well as parallel developments in other disciplines. Indeed, one of the ideas behind this book is that metadata and cataloguing are strongly related and that there is considerable overlap between the two. Pomerantz  2015  and Gartner  2016  have made a similar connection, although  Zeng  and  Qin   2015   emphasise  the  distinction  between  cataloguing  and metadata. This leads to discussion of the definitions of ‘metadata’ and a suggested form of words that is appropriate for this book. Examples of metadata use in e-publishing, libraries, archives and research data collections are used to illustrate the concept. The chapter then considers why metadata is important in the wider digital environment and some of the political issues that arise. This approach provides a way of assessing the models of metadata in terms of its use and its management. The chapter finally introduces the idea that metadata can be viewed in terms of the purposes to which it is put.   Why metadata? If  anyone  wondered  about  the  importance  of  metadata,  the  Snowden revelations about US government data-gathering activities should leave no one in any doubt. Stuart Baker, the NSA  National Security Agency  General Counsel, said ‘Metadata tells you everything about somebody’s life. If you have enough metadata you don’t really need content’  Schneier, 2015, 23 . The routine gathering of metadata about telephone calls originating outside the   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 4  4 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  USA or calls to foreign countries from the USA caused a great deal of concern, not only among American citizens but also among the US’s strongest allies and trading partners. The UK’s Investigatory Powers Act  UK Parliament, 2016  requires communications providers to keep metadata records of commun - ications via public networks  including the postal network  to facilitate security surveillance and criminal investigations. As Jacob Appelbaum said when the Wikileaks  controversy  first  blew  up,  ‘Metadata  in  aggregate  is content’  Democracy Now, 2013 . His point was that when metadata from different sources is aggregated it can be used to reconstruct the information content of communications that have taken place.  Although metadata has only recently become a topic for public discussion, it pervades our lives in many ways. Anyone who uses a library catalogue is dealing with metadata. Since the first edition of this book the idea of metadata librarians or even metadata managers has gained traction. Job advertisements often focus on making digital resources available to users. Roles that would have previously been described in terms of cataloguing and indexing are being expressed in the language of metadata. Re-use of data depends on metadata standards that allow different data sources to be linked to provide innovative new services. Many apps on mobile devices depend on combining location with live data feeds for transportation, air quality or property prices, for example. They depend on metadata.  Fundamental principles of metadata Some historical background Although the term ‘metadata’ is a recent one, many of the concepts and techniques of metadata creation, management and use originated with the development  of  library  catalogues.  If  we  regard  books  and  scrolls  as information objects, a book catalogue could be seen to be a collection of metadata. It contains data about information objects. An understanding of what  people  tried  to  do  before  the  term  ‘metadata’  was  coined  helps  to explain  the  concept  of  metadata.  The  historical  background  also  gives  a perspective on why metadata has become so important in recent years.  The idea of cataloguing information has been around at least since the Alexandrian Library in ancient Egypt. Callimachus of Cyrene  305–235 BC , the poet and author, was a librarian at Alexandria. He is widely credited with creating the first catalogue, the Pinakes, of the Alexandrian Library’s 500,000 scrolls. The catalogue was itself a work of 120 scrolls with titles grouped by subject and genre. This could be seen as the first recorded compilation of metadata. Gartner  2016  provides an elegant description of the history of metadata from antiquity to the present.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 5  INTRODUCTION  5  In Western Europe library cataloguing developed in the ecclesiastical and, later, academic libraries. In the eighth century AD the books donated by Gregory the Great to the Church of St Clement in Rome were catalogued in the form of a prayer. During the same era, Alcuin of York  735–804  developed a metrical catalogue for the cathedral library at York. Cataloguing developed, so that by the 14th century the location of books started to appear in catalogue records and by the 16th century the first alphabetical arrangements began to appear. Up until that time catalogues were used as inventories of stock rather than for finding books or for managing collections.   Modern library catalogues date back to the French code of 1791, the first national cataloguing code with author entry, which used catalogue cards and rules of accessioning and guiding. Cataloguing rules  an important aspect of metadata  were developed by Sir Anthony Panizzi for the British Museum Library and these were published in 1841. In the USA Charles A. Cutter prepared Rules of a Dictionary Catalog, which was published in 1876. The American Library Association and the Library Association in the UK both developed cataloguing rules around the start of the 20th century. This led to an agreement in 1904 to co-operate to produce an international cataloguing code, which was published as separate American and British editions in 1908.  Later, the International Conference on Cataloguing Principles in Paris in 1961 established a set of principles on the choice and form of headings in author title catalogues. These were incorporated into the first edition of the Anglo-American  Cataloguing  Rules   AACR   in  1967,  published  in  two versions by the Library Association and the American Library Association  Joint  Steering  Committee  for  Revision  of  AACR  &  CILIP,  2002 .The International Standard Bibliographic Descriptions  ISBDs  were developed by  IFLA,  the  International  Federation  of  Library Associations,  and  were incorporated into the second edition of the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules  AACR2 , published in 1978. ISBD specifies the sources of information used to describe a publication, the order in which the data elements appear and the punctuation used to separate the elements. Material-specific ISBDs were merged into a consolidated edition  IFLA, 2011 . AACR2 specifies how the  values  of  the  data  elements  are  determined.  This  was  an  important development because it made catalogues more interchangeable and allowed for conversion into machine-readable form  Bowman, 2003 .  In  the  mid-1960s  computers  started  being  used  for  the  purpose  of cataloguing and a new standard for the data format of catalogue records, MARC  Machine Readable Cataloguing  was established. MARC covers all kinds of library materials and is usable in automated library management systems.  Although  MARC  was  initially  used  to  process  and  generate catalogue cards more quickly, libraries soon started to use this as a means of   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 6  6 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  exchanging cataloguing data, which helped to reduce the cost of cataloguing original  materials.  The  availability  of  MARC  records  stimulated  the development of searchable electronic catalogues. The user benefited from wider access to searchable catalogues, and later on to union catalogues, which allowed them to search several library catalogues at once. Different versions of  MARC  emerged,  largely  based  on  national  variations  e.g.  USMARC, UKMARC  and  Norway’s  NORMARC.  Although  the  different  MARC versions were designed to reflect the particular needs and interests of different countries or commun ities of interest, this inhibited international exchange of records.  It  was  only  with  the  widespread  adoption  of  MARC  21  by  the national bibliographic authorities that a degree of harmonisation of national bibliographies was achieved.  The  growth  of  electronic  catalogues  and  the  development  of  textual databases able to handle summaries of published articles demanded new skills, which in turn contributed to the development of information science as a discipline. Information scientists developed many of the early electronic catalogues and bibliographic databases  Feather and Sturges, 1997 . They adapted library cataloguing rules for an electronic environment and did much of  the  pioneering  work  on  information  retrieval  theory,  including  the measures of precision and recall which are discussed in Chapter 6.  Although metadata was first used in library catalogues it is now widely used in records management, the publishing industry, the recording industry, government, the geospatial community and among statisticians. Its success as an approach may be because it provides the tools to describe electronic information  resources,  allowing  for  more  consistent  retrieval,  better management  of  data  sources  and  exchange  of  data  records  between applications and organisations.  Vellucci  1998  suggested that the term ‘metadata’ dates back to the 1960s but became established in the context of Database Management Systems  DBMS  in the 1970s. The first reference to ‘meta-data’ can be traced back to a PhD dissertation, ‘An infological approach to data bases’, which made the distinction between  Sundgren 1973 :    objects  real-world phenomena    information about the object   data representing information about the object  i.e. meta-data .  The term began to be widely used in the database research community by the mid-1970s.  A parallel development occurred in the geographical information systems  GIS  community and in particular the digital spatial information discipline.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 7  INTRODUCTION  7  In the late 1980s and early 1990s there was considerable activity within the GIS community to develop metadata standards to encourage interoperability between systems. Because government  especially local government  activity often requires data to describe location, there are significant benefits to be gained  from  a  standard  to  describe  location  or  spatial  position  across databases  and  agencies.  The  metadata  associated  with  location  data  has allowed  organisations  to  maintain  their  often  considerable  internal investments  in  geospatial  data,  while  still  co-operating  with  other organisations and institutions. Metadata is a way of sharing details of their data in catalogues of geographic information, clearing houses or via vendors of information. Metadata also gives users the information they need to process and interpret a particular set of geospatial data.  In the mid-1990s the idea of a core set of semantics for web-based resources was put forward for categorising the web and to enhance retrieval. This became known as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative  DCMI , which has established a standard for describing web content and which is not discipline- or language-specific. The DCMI defines a set of data elements which can be used as containers for metadata. The metadata is embedded in the resource, or it may be stored separately from the resource. Although developed with web  resources  in  mind  it  is  widely  used  for  other  types  of  document, including  non-digital  resources  such  as  books  and  pictures.  DCMI  is  an ongoing initiative which continues to develop tools for using Dublin Core.  This  position  was  questioned  by  Gorman   2004 ,  who  suggested  that metadata schemes such as Dublin Core are merely subsets of much more sophisticated frameworks such as MARC  Machine Readable Cataloguing . He suggested that without authority control and use of controlled vocab - ularies, Dublin Core and other metadata schemes cannot achieve their aim of improving  the  precision  and  recall  from  a  large  database   such  as  web resources on the internet . His solution is that existing metadata standards should  be  enriched  to  bring  them  up  to  the  standards  of  cataloguing. However, his arguments depend on a distinction being drawn between ‘full cataloguing’ and ‘metadata’. An alternative view  and one supported in this book  is that cataloguing produces metadata. Gorman is certainly right in suggesting that metadata will not be particularly useful unless it is created in line with more rigorous cataloguing approaches.  All  these  metadata  traditions  have  come  together  as  the  different communities have become aware of the others’ activities and have started to work together. The DCMI involved the database and the LIS communities from the beginning with the first workshop in 1995 in Dublin, Ohio, and has gradually drawn in other groups that manage and use metadata.    Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 8  8 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  Looking at existing trends, therefore, metadata is becoming more widely recognised and it is becoming a part of the specification of IT applications and software products. For example, ISO 15489  ISO, 2016a , the international standard for records management, specifies minimum metadata standards. Library  management  systems,  institutional  repositories  and  enterprise management systems handle resources that contain embedded metadata, which they are exploiting to enhance retrieval and data exchange. As a result, suppliers often incorporate metadata standards into their products.   This brief history of metadata demonstrates that it had several starting points and arose independently in different quarters. In the 1990s, wider awareness about metadata began and the work of bodies such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative has done a great deal to raise the profile of metadata and its widespread use in different communities. It has become an established part of the information environment today. However, its history does mean that there are distinct differences in the understanding of metadata and it is necessary to develop some universal definitions of the term. In the time since the publication of the previous edition of this book there have been a number of significant developments, which are reflected in the modified chapter structure of the book. Online social networking services have taken hold and become a pervasive environment. This has led to unparalleled volumes of transactional data, which is tracked and analysed to enable service providers to sell digital advertising services. This has become a major revenue earner for some of the largest corporations currently in existence, such as Facebook, Alphabet and Microsoft. The data about these transactions is metadata and this has become a tradable commodity. The concluding chapter  Chapter 14  discusses the implications of metadata and social media.   RDA  Resource Description and Access  was in development in 2004 and has now been adopted by major bibliographic authorities such as the Library of Congress and the British Library, replacing AACR2. At the time of writing BIBFRAME was due to be adopted as the replacement for MARC for encoding bibliographic data  metadata . These developments are covered in Chapter 4 on metadata standards.  Another  significant  development  is  the  establishment  of  services  and approaches based on the semantic web, first proposed by Tim Berners-Lee  1998 . The use of the Resource Description Framework  RDF  has facilitated the  development  of  linked  data  architecture  using  metadata  to  connect different information resources together to create new services. Two aspects of  linked  data  are  discussed  in  Chapter  12,  where  the  practicalities  of managing metadata are covered, and in Chapter 13 where linked open data is treated as an example of use of metadata in very large data collections.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 9  INTRODUCTION  9  The politics of information, and in particular metadata, have become more prominent in the intervening years between the first and second editions of this book. A whole new chapter  Chapter 10  on infor mation governance covers issues of privacy, security and freedom of information. It also considers the  role  of  metadata  in  compliance  with  legislative  requirements.  The concluding chapter  Chapter 14  also discusses some of the implications of metadata use in the context of online advertising and in social media.  What is metadata? Although there is an attractive simplicity in the original definition, ‘Metadata is data about data’, it does not adequately reflect current usage, nor does it describe the complexity of the subject.  At this stage it is worth interrogating the idea of metadata more fully. The concept of metadata has arisen from several different intellectual traditions. The different usages of metadata reflect the priorities of the communities that use  metadata.  One  could  speculate  about  whether  there  is  a  common understanding of what metadata is, and whether there is a definition that is generally applicable.  Metadata was originally referred to as ‘meta-data’, which emphasises the two word fragments that make up the term. The word fragment ‘meta’, which comes from the Greek ‘μετα’, translates into several distinct meanings in English. In this context it can be taken to mean a higher or superior view of the word it prefixes. In other words, metadata is data about data or data that describes data  or information . In current usage the ‘data’ in ‘metadata’ is widely  interpreted  as  information,  information  resource  or  information- containing entity. This allows inclusion of documentary materials in different formats and on different media.  Although  metadata  is  widely  used  in  the  database  and  programming professions, the focus in this book is on information resources managed in the museums, libraries and archives communities. Some in the library and information community defined metadata in terms of function or purpose. However,  in  this  context  metadata  has  more  wide-ranging  purposes, including retrieval and management of information resources, as we see in an early definition:   any data that aids in the identification, description and location of networked electronic resources. . . . Another important function provided by metadata is control of the electronic resource, whether through ownership and provenance metadata for validating information and tracking use; rights and permissions   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 10  10 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  metadata for controlling access; or content ratings metadata, a key component of some Web filtering applications.   Hudgins, Agnew and Brown, 1999   In his introduction to Metadata: a cataloger’s primer Richard Smiraglia provides a definition that encompasses discovery and management of information resources:  Metadata are structure, encoded data that describe the characteristics of information-bearing entities to aid in the identification, discovery, assessment and management of the described entities.   Smiraglia, 2005, 4   Pomerantz  2015, 21–2  talks about metadata often describing containers for data, such as books. He also suggests that metadata records are themselves containers  for  descriptions  of  data  and  its  containers  and  arrives  at  the following  definition  of  metadata:  ‘a  potentially  informative  object  that describes another potentially informative object’  Pomerantz, 2015, 26 . Zeng and Qin  2015, 11  talk about metadata in the following terms: ‘metadata encapsulate the information that describes any information-bearing entity’, before switching their attention to bibliographic metadata and components of metadata as described in Dublin Core. Gilliland also talks in terms of information objects:  Perhaps a more useful, ‘big picture’ way of thinking about metadata is as the sum total of what one can say about any information object at any level of aggregation. In this context, an information object is anything that can be addressed and manipulated as a discrete entity by a human being or an information system.   Gilliland, 2016   A further description is proposed to cover the range of situations in which metadata is used, while still making meaningful distinctions from the wider set of data about objects. If the object  say a packet of cereal on the super - market shelf  is not an information resource, then data about that object is merely data, not metadata. This is in contrast to Zeng and Qin  2015, 4 , who talk about a food label as containing metadata.  This book focuses primarily on metadata associated with documents, which can  be  defined  as  information-containing  artefacts,  often  held  in  memory institutions such as libraries, archives and museums. Robinson  2009; 2015  has built on the idea of the information chain, extending it beyond the original domain of published scientific information  Duff, 1997 . Buckland  1997  talks about the document as evidence and considers how digital documents sit with this. This thinking has also been applied to museum objects  Latham, 2012 .    Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 11  INTRODUCTION  11  What does metadata look like? Some metadata is not designed for human view, because it is transient and used for exchange of data between systems. Human-readable examples of metadata  range  from  html  meta-tags  on  web  pages  to  MARC  21  or BIBFRAME records used for exchanging cataloguing data between library management  systems.  The  metadata  can  be  expressed  in  a  structured language  such  as  XML   Extensible  Markup  Language   or  the  Resource Description  Framework   RDF   and  may  follow  guidelines  or  schema  for particular domains of activity.   The two examples below show metadata associated with different types of information resource. The first is an extract taken from the British Library’s main catalogue:  Title: Sapiens: a brief history of humankind   Yuval Noah Harari. Author: Yuval N. Harari, author. Subjects: Human beings — History; Dewey: 599.909 Publication Details: London: Vintage Books, [2015?] Language: English Identifier: ISBN 9780099590088  pbk   The field names are highlighted in bold – these are equivalent to the data elements in a metadata record. The content of each field, the metadata content, appears alongside the field name. This same cataloguing information can be displayed in other formats such as MARC 21.  The second example is of metadata from the home page of the Library of Congress website, Figure 1.1 on the next page. The form displays embedded metadata using a variety of standards. The top part of the form consists of metadata automatically extracted from the page coding. The lower part of the form lists metadata that the page has been tagged with according to various metadata standards. The ‘dc:’ label refers to Dublin Core. The ‘og:’ tag refers to Open Graph metadata.   Purposes of metadata Metadata is something which you collect for a particular purpose, rather than being a bunch of data you collect just because it is there or because you have some  public  duty  to  collect   Bell,  2016 .  One  of  the  main  drivers  for  the evolution of metadata standards is the use to which the metadata is put, its purpose. Even within the library and information profession, a wide range   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 12  12 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  Figure 1.1 Metadata from the Library of Congress home page  of metadata purposes has been identified. Two of the most useful models provide a basis for the purposes of metadata described in this book.  In the first model Day  2001  suggested that metadata has seven distinct purposes. He starts with resource description – identifying and describing the  entity  that  the  metadata  is  about.  The  second  purpose  is  focused  on information retrieval – and in the context of web resources this is called ‘resource discovery’. This is one of the primary focuses of the Dublin Core   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 13  INTRODUCTION  13  Metadata Initiative. He recognises that metadata is used for administering and managing resources  purpose 3  – for instance, flagging items for update after  set  periods  of  time  have  elapsed.  The  fourth  purpose,  intellectual property rights, is very important in the context of e-commerce. E-commerce has not been listed as a purpose in its own right, possibly because Day’s model  is  oriented  towards  web  resources.  Documenting  software  and hardware environments, the fifth purpose provides contextual information about a resource, but will not apply to every resource. This could be seen as one  aspect  of  resource  description.  Day’s  sixth  purpose,  preservation management, is a specialised form of administrative metadata and could be incorporated  into  purpose  3,  managing  information.  Finally,  providing information on context and authenticity is important in archives and records management, where being able to demonstrate the authenticity of a record is a part of good governance. For collection management, the provenance of individual  items  may  affect  their  value.  Table  1  summarises  the  seven purposes of metadata identified by Day.  Table 1.1 Day’s model of metadata purposes  1 2 3 4 5 6 7  Resource description Resource discovery Administration and management of resources Record of intellectual property rights Documenting software and hardware environments Preservation management of digital resources Providing information on context and authenticity  Gilliland  2016  takes a slightly different approach, although she also classifies metadata according to purpose. The use of metadata is categorised into more specific  sub-categories.  This  means  that  a  metadata  scheme  as  well  as individual  metadata  elements  could  fall  into  several  different  categories simultaneously. Gilliland provides some useful examples of the metadata that falls under each type  Table 1.2 . There is some common ground with Day, in that  they  both  identify:  administration   equivalent  to  management  and administration ; description  encompassing information retrieval or resource discovery ; and preservation as key purposes of metadata. The technical metadata in Gilliland corresponds to ‘Documenting hardware and software environments’ in Day. The ‘Use’ metadata could include transactional data as would be seen in an e-commerce system or could provide an audit trail for documents in a records management system.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 14  14 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  Table 1.2 Diﬀerent types of metadata and their functions, extracted from Gilliland  2016   Category  Deﬁnition  Example  Administrative Metadata used in managing  and administering collections and information resources  Descriptive  Metadata used to identify, authenticate, and describe collections and related trusted information resources  Preservation Metadata related to the  preservation management of collections and information resources  Technical  Metadata related to how a system functions or metadata behaves  Use  Metadata related to the level and type of use of collections and information resources    Acquisition and appraisal information   Rights and reproduction tracking    Documentation of legal, cultural, and community-access requirements and protocols   Location information   Selection criteria for digitization   Digital repatriation documentation     Metadata generated by original creator and system    Submission-information package    Cataloging records    Finding aids    Version control    Specialised indexes    Curatorial information    Linked relationships among resources    Descriptions, annotations, and emendations by creators and other users    Documentation of physical condition of resources    Documentation of actions taken to preserve physical and digital versions of resources  e.g. data refreshing and migration     Documentation of any changes occurring during digitization or preservation   Hardware and software documentation    System-generated procedural information  e.g. routing and event metadata     Technical digitization information  e.g. formats, compression ratios, scaling routines    Tracking of system-response times    Authentication and security data  e.g. encryption keys, passwords     Circulation records    Physical and digital exhibition records    Use and user tracking    Content re-use and multiversioning information    Search logs    Rights metadata  There is a lot of common ground between these two models and although neither of them specifically mentions ‘interoperability’ as a purpose, it is alluded  to.  For  instance,  Day’s  purpose  5  –  ‘documenting  software  and hardware environments’, touches on one aspect of interoperability and the   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 15  INTRODUCTION  15  Gilliland  model  refers  to  Technical  metadata  ‘related  to  how  a  system functions or metadata behaves’. There is some scope for simplifying Day’s model so that ‘Preservation management of digital resources’  purpose 6  becomes part of ‘Administration and management of resources’  purpose 3 , a  connection  that  he  previously  acknowledged   Day,  1999 .  Likewise, ‘Providing information on context and authenticity’  purpose 7  could be grouped with ‘Record of intellectual property rights’  purpose 4  to become ‘Record of context, intellectual property rights and authenticity’. Gilliland’s model  could  be  extended  by  separating  out  the  description  and  the information retrieval purposes for instance.  The six-point model This book proposes a modified, six-point model to describe the purposes of metadata, developed from the five-point model described in the first edition. It also separates description from retrieval as a separate, distinct purpose. Some areas have been consolidated, such as management of resources and preservation management  which is presented as a sub-set of management  and rights management, which is tied in with provenance and authenticity. This model also makes a distinction between the purposes of metadata  i.e. the  ways  in  which  it  is  used   and  the  intrinsic  properties  of  metadata elements. In doing this it becomes clear that each data element can be used in a variety of ways and fulfils more than one purpose.  The new model encompasses the purposes identified above and includes e-commerce  and  information  governance.  The  six  purposes  of  metadata proposed in this book are described below and provide the basis for Part II  Chapters 5–10 .  1 Resource identification and description – This is particularly important in  organisations that need to describe their information assets. For example, under the Freedom of Information Act in the UK, public authorities have to produce publication schemes which identify all their publications and intended publications. In the USA, Federal agencies have to make information available via the Government Information Locator Service  GILS . These both depend on adequate descriptions of the data. Information asset registers compiled by public authorities and increasingly by the corporate sector also require descriptions of information repositories and resources.  2 Retrieving information – In the academic sector a lot of effort has been put  into resource discovery on the internet. Aggregators and metadata harvesting systems allow users access to material from multiple   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 16  16 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  collections. The cataloguing data usually includes a description of the resource, controlled indexing terms and classification headings. This is a metadata resource and may also ‘mine’ or ‘extract’ metadata directly from target websites or electronic resources.  3 Managing information resources – The growth of electronic document and records management  EDRM  systems and the emergence of enterprise search systems are a consequence of operational and regulatory requirements of large organisations. EDRM systems need access to ‘cataloguing’ information about individual records in order to manage them effectively. Examples of metadata used in EDRM systems include: authorship, ownership  not necessarily the same thing , provenance of the document  for legal purposes  and dates of creation and modification. These and other data elements provide a basis for managing the documentation cost-effectively and consistently. Chapter 6 describes how metadata is used to manage the retention and disposal of records.  4 Managing intellectual property rights – Metadata provides a way of  declaring the ownership of the intellectual content of an information resource, including published documents, music, images and video. It also provides a record of the authenticity of the document by providing an audit trail so that, for instance, an electronic document or a digital image will stand up in court as legally admissible evidence. One of the preconditions for widespread acceptance of electronic documents as original evidence is that electronic systems are becoming the preferred medium for long-term storage.  5 Supporting e-commerce and e-government – Metadata acts as an enabler of  information and data transfer between systems, and as such is a key component in interoperability. In order to allow software applications that have been designed independently to pass data between them, a common framework for describing the data being transferred is needed so that each ‘knows’ how to handle that data in the most appropriate manner. This may be at the level of distinguishing between different languages, or understanding different data formats.  Interoperability is one of the enablers for e-commerce. When a piece of data  or an aggregation of data  is passed from one system to another the accompanying metadata  which is sometimes embedded in the digital file  allows the new application to make sense of the data and to use it in the appropriate fashion. For instance, in the book trade many suppliers using different software packages need to be able to exchange data reliably. The widely adopted ONIX standard allows different agents in the supply chain from author to reader to exchange data without the need to integrate their systems.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 17  INTRODUCTION  17  6 Information governance – Information governance is now an established area of metadata application. It can be used to provide an audit trail for data collections, for instance. This allows compliance managers to demonstrate that they are handling data in an appropriate fashion. For example, sensitive personal data needs to be kept securely, with access limited to specified individuals. Freedom of information legislation, on the other hand, may require a retention schedule and publication scheme to be associated with specific information resources. Some metadata standards have data elements specifically geared to recording an audit trail associated with a document.  Multiple purposes Metadata can be used within one application for several different purposes. The model developed here helps in the analysis of metadata applications and the understanding of its characteristics in different situations.   Why is metadata important? A more comprehensive understanding of metadata can be developed from studying the above examples. The development of cataloguing over more than  two  millennia  has  provided  a  set  of  tools  for  describing  published information.  This  has  been  drawn  on  by  the  web  community. Correspondingly, the growth of the internet has focused public attention on the importance of information retrieval and management and has stimulated the development of tools to improve retrieval performance. Having a clear understanding of what metadata is and how it is managed provides a means of handling information resources more effectively.   Organisation of the book This book is arranged in three sections. Part I  Chapters 1–4  deals with the fundamental concepts of metadata and can be seen as an introduction to the subject. It is pitched at the community of information professionals and users such as academics that are interested in metadata for managing and retrieving documentary information or information resources. The book uses the terms ‘document’ in the widest sense as a vehicle for information communications  Robinson, 2009 .  Part  II   Chapters  5–10   considers  the  purposes  of  metadata  from identification  of  information  resources  to  retrieval,  and  onwards  to  e- commerce applications and information governance. This builds on the five   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 18  18 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  purposes identified in the first edition and has been extended and modified to reflect the full range of uses of metadata in the 14 years that have since passed.  Part III  Chapters 11–14  is about the management of metadata and starts with well established methods of managing standards, schemas and metadata quality.  It  then  considers  recent  developments  in  taxonomies,  encoding schemes and ontologies and the role that these play in structuring knowledge. It moves on to big data and the challenges faced by those wishing to exploit very large data collections. It then considers the starting point of this book, politics. What are the implications for privacy and national security? The final chapter also considers the future of metadata – from the empowerment of users  through  to  professional  development  –  and  considers  who  will  be responsible for managing metadata in the future.   Throughout this book ‘metadata’ is used as a singular collective noun. The word ‘data’ is used as a mass noun and is treated as a collective singular noun in accordance with most common current usage  Rosenberg, 2013, 18–19 . This ties in with the gradual disappearance of the word ‘datum’. Even Steven Pinker,  one  of  the  foremost  thinkers  and  writers  about  linguistics acknowledges this, although he makes clear his own preferences:   I like to use data as a plural of datum, but I’m in a fussy minority even among scientists. Data is rarely used as a plural today, just as candelabra and agenda long ago ceased to be plurals. But I still like it.   Pinker, 2015, 271    Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 19  CHAPTER 2  Defining, describing and expressing metadata  Overview This chapter describes some of the concepts associated with metadata. It considers ways in which metadata can be expressed and focuses on document mark-up languages. It then  considers  schemas  as  one  method  of  defining  metadata  standards  and  data elements.  Databases  of  metadata  are  described  as  an  alternative  to  embedded metadata. The last section of the chapter shows some examples of how metadata is used in different contexts such as document creation, records management, library catalogues, digital repositories and image collections.  Defining metadata Metadata is used in catalogues of digital and physical information resources. The requirements for books in a library catalogue might be very different from the metadata embedded in a web page, but the general concepts of metadata apply to both. Its use for digital and printed resources provides some helpful examples. Document mark-up languages such as SGML and XML are widely used to express metadata standards.   Document mark-up The development of mark-up languages is an excellent example of the way in which metadata can be applied to and expressed in documents. Electronic documents are one of the most common forms of digital object to which metadata is applied, and range from web pages through to electronic records, and may incorporate text, images and interactive material.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 20  20 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  Mark-up languages were initially developed to describe the layout and presentation  of  documents.  They  enabled  organisations  to  manage  large numbers of documents that needed to be presented in different formats. Mark-up languages also provide a means of defining metadata standards.  Mark-up  languages,  which  arose  from  text  processing,  are  defined  as: ‘computer systems that can automate parts of the document creation and publishing  process’   Goldfarb  and  Prescod,  2001 .  Mark-up  languages containing a combination of text and formatting instructions include:    HTML   XML   TEI   LaTeX.  Figure 2.1 shows: raw text  the data , the text with formatting instructions  the mark-up  and the text as it would appear to the reader  the rendition .  This is an example of marked-up text that shows large and small text as well as bold and italics  This is an example of marked-up text that shows  large  and  small text as well as  bold  and  italics   This is an example of marked-up text that shows large and small text as well as bold and italics  data   raw text   mark-up   text with mark-up  instructions   rendition   text as it appears  to the reader   Figure 2.1 Example of marked-up text  Standard Generalized Markup Language  SGML  Standard Generalized Markup Language  SGML  is used as the basis for describing  many  web  pages  and  for  marking  up  metadata.  Generalised document mark-up originated in the late 1960s from the work of three IBM researchers, Goldfarb, Mosher and Lorie, whose initial letters make up the ‘GML’ in SGML  Goldfarb, 1990 . They determined that a mark-up language would need three attributes:    Common data representation – so that different systems and applications  are able to process text in the same representation   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 21  DEFINING, DESCRIBING AND EXPRESSING METADATA  21    Mark-up should be extensible – so that it can support all the different types of information that must be exchanged. There is potentially an infinite variety of document types that can be generated    Document types need rules – formal rules for documents of a particular  type, which can be used to test their conformance to the type and therefore how they are processed.  These attributes provide a framework for representing metadata. A common representation is needed so that metadata elements are clearly identifiable and can be processed appropriately. The extensibility of mark-up languages allows considerable flexibility in creating metadata tags. Document types are used to describe the ‘rules’ for metadata schemas, so that there is consistency in their expression. The development of a generalised mark-up language ensured  that  documents  could  be  handled  in  a  variety  of  environments. Rather  than  focusing  on  formatting  instructions,  a  generalised  mark-up language tags different data types. A stylesheet translates generalised mark- up into formatting instructions. For instance, it can instruct a system to make section headings in bold text and quotations in italics. Different stylesheets can be applied to the same marked-up text. This means that the same text can be  presented  in  different  ways,  for  instance  as  a  printed  publication,  or displayed as a web page viewed with a browser  Figure 2.2 .  This is an example of marked-up text that shows  large  and  small text as well as  bold  and  italics   Stylesheet 1  Stylesheet 2  This is an example of marked-up text that shows large and small text as well as bold and italics  This is an example of marked-up text that shows large and small text as well as bold and italics  Marked-up text  Formatting instructions  Text as it is displayed  to readers  Figure 2.2 Rendered text   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 22  22 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  SGML was for a long time an international standard, ISO 8879  ISO, 1986 . Although now withdrawn, it is still the basis for other mark-up languages. Hypertext Markup Language  HTML  is an application of SGML. HTML is used to encode the content of web pages and is widely used to describe web pages,  including  the  metadata  embedded  in  them.  HTML5  recognises metadata content as a specific category of HTML content:  Metadata content is content that sets up the presentation or behavior of the rest of the content, or that sets up the relationship of the document with other documents, or that conveys other ‘out of band’ information.   W3C, 2014b   The head of the document holds the metadata, including the title and other metadata content held in the data element ‘meta’.  TEI is a specialist mark-up language widely used in the digital humanities  TEI  Consortium,  2016 .  The  TEI  header  is  where  metadata  is  normally embedded.  However,  marking  up  documents  in  this  way  allows  other characteristics of a document to be identified and retrieved or processed. The Title  Statement  includes  title,  author,  and  funder  information.  Other bibliographic information includes edition and publication details. Although TEI is not a cataloguing standard, its structure facilitates identification and use of structured metadata.  LaTeX is another specialist mark-up language, developed for scientific and mathematical publications. Different templates can be applied to a marked- up document to format it to conform with a variety of academic publications. The current version is LaTeX2e. LaTeX3 was still in development at the time of writing  LaTeX3 Project Team, 2001 .  XML  Extensible Markup Language  Extensible Markup Language  XML  is a subset of SGML. It offers the ability to represent data in a simple, flexible, human-readable form. As an open standard, XML is not controlled by one vendor or one country. The XML specifications are published by the World Wide Web Consortium  W3C , an international co-operative venture  W3C, 2016 . XML can be used as a basis for  exchange  of  data  or  documents  between  people,  computers  and applications.  It  goes  further  than  HTML  because  it  provides  a  way  of expressing a semantic context for data, as well as dealing with the syntax. It is the semantic component which gives XML the ability to exchange data in a meaningful way and this is one of the reasons for its widespread uptake. XML handles characters, which are made of character data  the text or data   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 23  DEFINING, DESCRIBING AND EXPRESSING METADATA  23  content   and  mark-up,  which  encodes  the  logical  structure  and  other attributes of the data. Documents are organised into elements which break the document down into units of meaning, purpose or layout. The elements correspond to fields in a database, as will be seen in later examples in this chapter. XML documents can also use entities, which may refer to an external document or a dynamic database record, or can be used to label a defined piece of text for re-use within the document.  Document type definitions  DTDs  Cole and Han  2013  provide an excellent description of XML in the context of cataloguing and metadata use. They describe in a step-wise process the way in which details about the semantics of a document can be embedded in an  XML  document.  This  depends  on  following  a  syntax   or  grammar  specifying the way in which information about a document is expressed. If this  syntactic  information   rules  for  the  organisation  of  content  within  a document  is held in a separate document, a DTD, it can then be referred to by multiple documents. This makes the management of the syntax rules  or grammar   much  simpler  and  in  theory  any  system  that  renders  XML documents should follow the reference to the DTD in order to understand the way in which the fields are formed.  A class of similar documents can be called a ‘document type’. A Document Type Definition  DTD  is a set of rules for using XML to represent documents of a particular type. DTDs provide one form of metadata expression in mark- up languages, as they refer to the vocabulary and the rules used to describe metadata.   The DTD defines the elements  or fields  of a document. This means that similar documents can be defined by the same DTD. For instance, a memo might have the following elements:  To:  the addressee  From:  the author  Date:  date on which the memo was sent  Subject:  what the memo is about  Body:  the main text of the memo   The DTD for a memo can be used to test the ‘validity’ of the document. In other  words  does  a  document  purporting  to  be  a  memo  have  the  right elements appearing in the right order? If it does, the DTD provides the means for the memo to be expressed in a variety of formats determined by the appropriate stylesheet. In this example, the ‘Memo’ DTD might have separate   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 24  24 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  stylesheets  for  printed-out  memos,  screen  displays,  and  e-mail  versions. Carrying on with the memo example, the elements are delimited by tags. The ‘To’ element could be expressed by the following tags:   Jane  Williams   The element may have attributes associated with it – in terms of the encoding system used for instance, or the type of data that appears in that element. For example the ‘To’ element could be defined by the following statement:     This  indicates  that  the  ‘To’  data  element  consists  of  Parsed   parsable  Character data  PCDATA .  XML schemas An alternative way of defining metadata is to use XML schemas. They offer greater flexibility than DTDs and are widely used for expressing metadata standards. Schemas are XML languages used for defining similar types of document in terms of their structure, content and meaning. The W3C website defines them in the following terms:   XML Schemas express shared vocabularies and allow machines to carry out rules made by people. They provide a means for defining the structure, content and semantics of XML documents.   Sperberg-McQueen and Thompson, 2014    They are described using XSDL  XML Schema Definition Language . The following extracts are from an example of an XML schema that defines simple Dublin Core metadata elements  Cole et al., 2008 .  The  start  of  the  schema  contains  declarations  about  the  nature  of  the  schema, including two namespace references ‘xmlns’.    <xs:schema  xmlns:xs=‘www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema’  xmlns=‘http:  purl.org dc elements 1.1 ’ targetNamespace=‘http:  purl.org dc elements 1.1 ’ elementFormDefault=‘qualified’ attributeFormDefault=‘unqualified’>  This is followed by annotations from the authors about the background to the schema and then a namespace reference to the standard for XML.

It  defines  a  complexType  SimpleLiteral  which  permits  mixed content  and  makes  the  xml:lang  attribute  available.  It  disallows  child elements  by  use  of  minOcccurs maxOccurs. However,  this  complexType  does  permit  the  derivation  of  other complexTypes  which  would  permit  child  elements. All  elements  are  declared  as  substitutable  for  the  abstract  element any,  which  means  that  the  default  type  for  all  elements  is dc:SimpleLiteral.      Namespace declarations can also be used to link to a metadata standard or encoding scheme at the start of a record. The main body of the schema defines the 15 data elements in simple Dublin Core.                                    Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 26  26 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  Schemas are commonly associated with databases, where each data element corresponds to a field in a database. As with databases, the schema can be set up to provide semantic and syntactic checks on data. In other words, checks on the meaning and grammar of an expression can be made. Syntactic checks, for example, can be applied to the data to ensure that it is of the appropriate type and is expressed in a format that can be processed by the database software. For example, dates can be defined using international standard ISO 8601:2004 to get over the problem of differing American and British date order  ISO, 2004c . For instance, ‘10 12 17’ means ‘10th December 2017’ in Britain and ‘October 12th 2017’ in the USA. Schemas can also apply semantic checks to ensure that business rules are followed by requiring the value of an element  the field content  to fall within a specified range. For instance, the value of the  month  element  in  the  data  should  be  between  1  and  12.  The www.schema.org website offers a resource for sharing schemas of this type and this is described in more detail in Chapter 12.  Namespace Namespace is used to locate definitions for metadata schema from the Internet. This ensures  greater  consistency  of  terminology  used  to  define  metadata  elements  and provides a way of sharing elements. In the Dublin Core example the namespace that provides the original reference to Dublin core elements is as follows:  xmlns=‘http:  purl.org dc elements 1.1 ’  A formal definition is  Bray et al., 2009 :  An XML namespace is  identified  by  a  URI  reference  [RFC3986];  element  and attribute names may be placed in an XML namespace using the mechanisms described in this specification.  Databases of metadata The previous section about the mark-up of documents focused particularly on embedded metadata. For example, a web resource may have metadata tags and content embedded in the resource. Electronic documents and other digital materials often have embedded metadata, allowing other applications and systems to effectively process them. However, this is not the only way of handling metadata. In many systems the metadata may be held separately in a database.   Databases  of  metadata  may  be  generated  at  the  point  of  creation  of documents by Enterprise Content Management  ECM  systems, for instance. ECM systems store the metadata about documents in a central database and   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 27  DEFINING, DESCRIBING AND EXPRESSING METADATA  27  use this data to manage and handle the documents. This allows documents to be brought forward for review, the workflow to be managed, and access to be controlled. Institutional repositories and library management systems operate in a similar fashion, working with central collections of metadata, the library catalogue or repository database.   Examples of metadata in use Data can be catalogued in a variety of ways, which are demonstrated by some of the examples described here. Common applications such as word processors, ECM systems, library catalogues and directories of digital repositories all make extensive use of metadata. Some of these application areas are described more fully in the chapters about the specific purposes of metadata.  Word-processed documents Applications that are used for preparing documents, such as word-processing packages, automatically generate metadata when a document is saved for the first time. In some cases systems can be configured to prompt the author for metadata when a new document is saved. Metadata associated with the user such as ‘Author’ and ‘Company’ may be automatically generated. This can be edited  and  additional  metadata  can  be  added  manually.  A  controlled vocabulary can be a useful way of ensuring consistent retrieval of documents. For instance, keywords selected from a thesaurus can be added as metadata to enrich the subject description of the document.   The screenshot in Figure 2.3 on the next page shows a typical metadata screen associated with a word-processed document. In Microsoft Word there are additional tabs for: ‘Statistics’, and ‘Contents’, which display metadata such as document size, time spent editing it, the session number, and the number of words. The final tab ‘Custom’ allows for additional optional data associated with document and records management.  Electronic records management The word-processing example has shown metadata designed for human use and often requiring human intervention. However, metadata is increasingly used by computer applications without direct human intervention. ECM and EDRM systems make use of metadata associated with documents to manage them effectively. While many of these data elements can be examined by human beings, they are used by the software to process records during their lifecycles.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 28  28 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  Figure 2.3 Word document metadata  An example of this is the retention period of a record. If a record is assigned a specific category according to a file plan  usually a business classification scheme applied to an organisation’s records , there will be an associated retention  period.  Typically  each  category  in  the  file  plan  will  have  a  set retention period. For example, in a recruitment exercise, interview records may be kept for six months from the interview date before disposal  unless the candidate is successfully recruited, in which case they become part of the employee record with its own retention rules . Invoices may be kept for six   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 29  DEFINING, DESCRIBING AND EXPRESSING METADATA  29  years,  on  the  other  hand,  to  comply  with  company  legislation  in  some countries. The file category assigned to a document or record is encoded as a metadata element that the EDRM system uses to identify records that are due for review or disposal at the end of each retention period. In order to do this the  system  will  have  to  call  on  another  metadata  element  containing information on the date created. The system can then generate a disposal list for review by a records manager, or administrator.  Library catalogues Metadata is particularly useful for large collections of documents or other materials, where it can be used for managing the resource and for finding specific items. A catalogue becomes essential for retrieval when there are more than a few hundred items in a collection. The arrangement of books in a subject classification is not always sufficient for good subject retrieval. If a book  is  about  more  than  one  subject,  it  can  only  be  held  in  one  place physically. It may also be out on loan, which means that shelf browsing would not identify it. Early examples of library metadata were held on catalogue cards. In the 1960s electronic catalogues began to appear and are routinely used in most libraries today. Library users or patrons can find books by searching the catalogue by a variety of criteria such as author name, words in the title, classification code  which determines the arrangement on the shelves  and keyword  subject .   Figure 2.4 on the following page shows the results of a search on the subject ‘Sherlock Holmes’ in the catalogue from the City of Westminster Libraries, London. In this example the metadata is used to store comparable data about individual items in the collection. This allows users to search consistently across the whole collection. Other metadata associated with items, such as location  library branch , author and format are all metadata elements that can  be  used  to  refine  the  results  of  the  search.  Within  each  item,  other metadata  such  as  title,  publication  date,  abstract  and  availability  are displayed.  The detailed record shows additional metadata elements, including ISBN, subject terms, physical description and genre. An even more detailed system record such as that shown in Figure 2.5 will be available to library staff, which will contain administrative data such as date of acquisition, accession number and  the  status  of  the  item  in  collection  management  processes  such  as labelling, repair and withdrawal.

Common cataloguing rules such as RDA  and previously AACR2  help to ensure a degree of consistency of each data element across systems. For instance, the author name might take the form Surname, First Name.  The WorldCat union catalogue provided by OCLC is the largest in the world with  at the time of writing  over 300 million catalogue records pointing to over 2 billion individual items in 72,000 libraries in 140 countries. In the example in Figure 2.6, a search on Francis Kéré, the architect from Burkina Faso, yields 317 items where his name is mentioned.   Figure 2.6 WorldCat search   2017, OCLC, Inc.  Selecting one item from the results list provides a detailed catalogue entry for that  item.  Figure  2.7  on  the  next  page  is  the  WorldCat  entry  with supplementary information about holdings in participating libraries.

Digital repository search Another kind of search operates from a central database of details about digital repositories. In Figure 2.8 a search of OpenDOAR  the directory of open access repositories  for Brazil lists 86 repositories. It is possible to narrow down the search by a number of different criteria which can be selected from drop-down lists, such as subject area, language, content type, repository type or by free text.

Figure 2.9 Detailed OpenDOAR record  Image repositories Image repositories such as iStockPhoto, Getty Images and Flickr use specialist metadata as well as keywords to help people to retrieve images  Getty Images, 2017; iStockphoto LP, 2017; Yahoo! Inc., 2017 . So, for instance, it is possible to search Getty Images by the following criteria: image type, orientation, number of people, colour, image size, age  of people in the image , people composition,  image  style,  ethnicity,  photographers,  and  royalty-free collections.  Conclusion These examples of metadata are based on the principle that metadata may be embedded in a digital object or held separately from the resource that it describes. Mark-up languages such as XML provide a way of handling and exchanging metadata. They also provide a means of describing metadata standards.

The chapter starts with an overview of data modelling and its relationship to metadata. It defines some of the terminology used to describe modelling languages, using the Unified Modelling Language  UML  as an example. Systems such as RDF and the  ABC  Ontology  are  discussed  before  considering  domain-specific  modelling frameworks such as the Library Reference Model  LRM , indecs for the book trade and OAIS for online exchange of information. Van Hooland and Verborgh  2014  talk about four types of modelling: tabular, relational, meta mark-up and RDF. This chapter focuses on the last two types.  Metadata models A  metadata  standard  is  a  type  of  data  model  which  provides  a  way  of conceptualising the characteristics of an information resource. A data model may have its own syntax  grammar  and semantics  meaning  and may be expressible in a mark-up language such as XML  W3C, 2016 . One of the interesting aspects of the development of metadata standards has been the convergence of different communities of interest. People have recognised the benefits of working within common frameworks. In order to do so they have adopted  common  languages  for  describing  the  data  that  they  handle. Languages such as XML and RDFa have played an important role in equip - ping these communities with a set of tools to describe data and relationships between data elements  Herman et al., 2015 .    Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 36  36 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  Unified Modelling Language  UML  UML provides a framework for describing data and for data modelling. Hay  2006  talks about ‘semantic data constructs’ when discussing metadata. He introduces the idea of different levels of data, starting with real world things. These might be people or books or items in a store. The next level up is ‘data about real world things’. Typically this would consist of data in databases, including HR systems  people , a library catalogue  books  or a stock control system  items in a store . At the next level up is data about a database or ‘metadata’. This in effect is a data model because it describes the structure of the data. An example from the database domain would be a data dictionary, which is a list of the fields in a database and their characteristics.  UML originates from the Object Management Group and is an ongoing initiative  with  organisational  members   OMG,  2015 .  ISO  19505-1,  the equivalent international standard, states: ‘The Unified Modelling Language is  a  visual  language  for  specifying,  constructing,  and  documenting  the artifacts of systems.’  ISO, 2012a, 8 .  Resource Description Framework  RDF  The Resource Description Framework  RDF  is a system for modelling data and  is  a  way  of  expressing  metadata  about  an  information  resource  or information object  Schreiber and Raimond, 2014 . RDFa is a language based on RDF for representing information about resources on the internet  Herman et al., 2015 . It allows for exchange of this information on the web and for processing by applications. RDF was one of the first tools developed for modelling and describing web resources. It goes beyond metadata description by  providing  a  model  for  the  relationships  between  different  metadata elements.  It  bridges  the  divide  between  human-generated  and  machine- generated   and  machine-processed   metadata.  RDF  works  with  different types of object or data entities and defines the relationship between them.  RDF can be expressed in mark-up languages such as HTML and XML. Its purpose  is  to  enable  the  encoding,  exchange  and  re-use  of  metadata definitions  or  schema.  The  system  is  flexible,  allowing  each  resource description community to define its own metadata elements. It also allows those communities to tap into existing schemas and to re-use elements that may be relevant. The namespace convention ensures that there is a unique reference back to the original definition. This system exploits the power and range of the internet and avoids the need for a central register or repository of data elements. As an object-oriented system RDF is based on three object types:   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 37  DATA MODELLING  37  1 Resources – anything being described by RDF expressions. This could be  a web page or a printed book, for instance.  2 Properties – an attribute or characteristic of the resource being described.  For instance, ‘Creator’ can be applied to a web page, or ‘Author’ is a property of a book. The schema specification will describe how that property is expressed. For instance, cataloguing rules may require authors to take the form: Surname, Initials. For example, the author Jane Smith would be expressed as ‘Smith, J.’.  3 Statements – a statement applies to a specific resource and includes a  subject  the resource , the predicate  the property  and object  the value of the property .  The statement syntax: subject – predicate – object is known as a triple or 3- tuple  Figure 3.1 . The following statement describes the author of a book and can be represented by the triple:  The book, The Hound of the Baskervilles  subject  has creator  predicate  Arthur Conan Doyle  object .  The Hound of the  Baskervilles  Creator  Arthur Conan Doyle  Figure 3.1 An RDF triple  This structure is recursive, so that the subject of a triple can be another triple. In other words there can be metadata about the metadata. It is also possible to chain statements to produce more detailed metadata records, as illustrated in Figure 3.2. The author name is represented by a Uniform Resource Identifier  URI  or an Internationalized Resource Identifier  IRI  with properties of ‘Name’  The Hound of the  Baskervilles  Creator  http:  viaf.org viaf 65283845   Name  Lifespan  Arthur Conan Doyle  1859–1930  Figure 3.2 More complex RDF triple   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 38  38 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  and ‘Lifespan’ associated with it. In the ‘node and arc’ diagram below the object of the statement is itself a statement. ‘The Hound of the Baskervilles has creator . . .’ leads to the statement ‘URI http:  viaf.org viaf 65283845 has name Arthur Conan Doyle and has lifespan 1859–1930’.  The mandated use of URIs in RDF makes it a powerful tool for creating linked data. Examples of its use in open data initiatives can be found in Chapter  13.  The  author  statement  in  Figure  3.3  can  be  expressed  in  the following terms:  The Hound of the Baskervilles has author Arthur Conan Doyle http:  viaf.org viaf 181625655 has dc:creator http:  viaf.org viaf 65283845 http:  viaf.org viaf 181625655 http:  purl.org dc terms creator   http:  viaf.org viaf 65283845  http:  viaf.org viaf 181625655  http:  viaf.org viaf 65283845  http:  purl.org dc   terms creator  Figure 3.3 A triple expressed as linked data  Looking at the construction of an RDF statement expressed in XML syntax helps  to  show  the  way  in  which  RDF  works.  In  this  example  the  RDF container is surrounded by a pair of tags, opening with:     and closing with:     The opening RDF statement includes the RDF namespace declaration, which refers to the specific URI. This allows multiple and consistent use of XML resources, because different documents can refer to the same namespace. It also ensures that an application can recognise and use the appropriate version of RDF to interpret the statements that follow.  <rdf:RDF  xmlns:  rdf=www.w3.org 1999 02 22-rdf-syntax-ns xmlns:dc=‘http:  purl.org dc elements 1.1 ’>  Expressed with URIs to allow for linked data activity:   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 39  DATA MODELLING  39  <rdf:Description  rdf:about=http:  viaf.org viaf 181625655   <rdf:Description rdf:about=‘http:  viaf.org viaf 65283845’>      In  summary,  RDF  is  a  modelling  system  widely  used  to  analyse  web resources  objects  and the relationships between different entities or data elements  associated  with  the  resources.  Its  expressiveness  and  recursive nature allows for complex entities  such as detailed bibliographic citations  to  be  represented.  It  also  provides  a  language  for  exchange  of  metadata between systems so that new services can be developed and presented to users.  Dublin Core The Dublin Core metadata standard, which is described in Chapter 4, is a widely used metadata standard for describing online resources  DCMI, 2012 . It is underpinned by a data model which can be represented in UML  Powell et  al.,  2007 .  Figure  3.4  shows  the  DCMI  Resource  Model,  showing  the relationship between a resource description and establish ing the fact that each property-value pair contains one property and one value. For example, the property ‘dc:creator’ might have the value ‘Arthur Conan Doyle’. A resource  resource  property- value pair  1  value  1  property  literal value  non-literal  value  described resource  Key label  relationship deﬁned by label ‘is’ or ‘is a’ ‘contains n’ or ‘has n’  Figure 3.4 DCMI resource model  DCMI, 2012, licensed under CC BY 4.0    Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 40  40 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  may be described using multiple property-value pairs, such as creator, title, identifiers  ISBNs, DOIs etc. .  The Library Reference Model  LRM  and the development of RDA RDA   Resource  Description  and  Access ,  the  cataloguing  standard  that replaces AACR2, is based on the Library Reference Model, which superseded the  Functional  Requirements  for  Bibliographic  Records   FRBR ,  and  the Functional  Requirements  for  Authority  Data   FRAD    Joint  Steering Committee for Development of RDA, 2014; IFLA, 1998; IFLA, 2013; Riva, Le Boeuf and Žumer, 2017 . The Functional Requirements for Subject Authority Data  FRSAD  was introduced to RDA in 2015 and has also been incorporated into LRM  Galeffi et al., 2016 .  LRM is based on entity-relationship modelling and covers bibliographic data. It is designed to support five generic user tasks summarised below  Riva, Le Boeuf and Žumer, 2017,13 :  Find – To bring together information about one or more resources of  interest by searching on any relevant criteria.   Identify – To clearly understand the nature of the resources found and to  distinguish between similar resources.  Select – To determine the suitability of the resources found, and to be  enabled to either accept or reject specific resources.  Obtain – To access the content of the resource. Explore – To discover resources using the relationships between them and  thus place the resources in a context.  LRM defines relationships between entities which have particular attributes. Entities are ‘key objects of interest to users of library information systems’  Riva, Le Boeuf and Žumer, 2017 . The top level entity is res  ‘thing’ in Latin . The eight entities at the next level are: work, expression, manifestation, item, agent, nomen  ‘name’ in Latin , place, and time-span. The relationships between four of these entities are core to RDA and are illustrated in Figure 3.5 opposite:    Work – a distinct intellectual or artistic creation   Expression – intellectual or artistic realisation of a work   Manifestation – physical embodiment of an expression of a work   Item – single exemplar of a manifestation.  For example, the work Sapiens: a brief history of humankind by Yuval Noah Harari, published in the UK in 2014, was originally published in Hebrew in   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 41  DATA MODELLING  41  WORK  is realized through  realizes  EXPRESSION  is embodied in  embodies  MANIFESTATION  is exempliﬁed by  exempliﬁes  ITEM  Figure 3.5      Relationships between Work, Expression, Manifestation and Item  based on Riva,  Le Boeuf and Žumer, 2017   Israel in 2011 and has been widely translated. Each translation could be seen as a work or as an expression of the original Hebrew publication. If the English version is seen as a work  with a relationship to the original Hebrew work  an expression might be the edition published by Harvill Secker in London in 2014. The hardback edition with ISBN 9781846558238 is a manifest - ation of the English-language version. An example of that manifestation is the item, which is the copy of the hardback English-language edition that is on my bookshelf at home.  Figure 3.6 overleaf shows in general terms the relationship between a work, expression, manifestation or item and the responsible agent  which could be a person or a corporate body . The double-headed arrows indicate that there may be multiple instances of a relationship between entities. For instance a work is created by a person  or persons . The reverse relationship is that a person creates a work  or works .  In the example title Sapiens, the work was created by Yuval Noah Harari. The English edition in hardback was created, manufactured and distributed by publisher Harvill Secker. The copy on my bookshelf is owned by me.

This has had a profound effect on cataloguing practice, so that for instance, the common bibliographic elements of different expressions of a work are catalogued only once at work level and the same basic record is refined with additional fields that apply at expression, manifestation and item levels. However, alternative bibliographic models such as BIBFRAME reject the expression and manifestation entities  Baker, Coyle and Petiya, 2014; Library of Congress, 2017a . The complexities of converting from AACR2 to RDA  should  not  be  underestimated.  Apart  from  identifying  equivalent records using AACR2, there is the challenge of reconciling variations in the higher-level  metadata.  For  instance,  the  work-level  metadata  of  two manifestations  may  not  match  exactly.  Additionally  there  may  be  some ambiguity between expression and manifestation.  ABC Ontology and the semantic web The ABC Ontology is ‘a basic model and ontology that provides the notional basis for developing domain, role or community specific ontologies’  Lagoze   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 43  DATA MODELLING  43  and Hunter, 2002 . The model is intended to provide a basis for analysing existing metadata ontologies, to give communities the tools to develop their own ontologies and to provide a mechanism for mapping between metadata ontologies.The ABC Ontology was developed to facilitate interoperability between metadata ontologies from different domains. Its target is to ‘model physical, digital and analogue objects held in libraries, archives and museums and on the Internet’  Lagoze and Hunter, 2002 . This includes books, museum objects, digital images, sound recordings and multimedia resources. It can model abstract concepts such as intellectual content and time-based events such as a performance or a lifecycle event that happens to an object such as publication of a book. The model is based on a primitive category ‘Entity’, with three categories at the next level: Temporality, Actuality and Abstraction. The data elements used fall into four main categories, as shown here:    ENTITY – Time – Place    TEMPORALITY  – Situation – Event – Action    ACTUALITY  – Artifact  – Agent    ABSTRACTION  – Work   Each category has subcategories that allow for more precise descriptions of the models. These in turn can be broken down into subclasses specific to a particular domain, such as libraries, museums or web resources. The ABC Ontology allows for modelling of time-dependent relationships, which are particularly important in museums and archives  where the provenance of an item is key to its integrity , rights management  where it is important to track who has used a work under what conditions and when  and for events such  as  a  musical  performance.  Figure  3.7  on  page  44  is  a  simple representation of a publication using the ABC Ontology. This is a simplified representation of part of the publishing process. The work Omeros by the late Nobel Laureate Derek Walcott is expressed as a book. The book is manifest as  the  edition  published  by  Faber  &  Faber  Ltd   Walcott,  1990 .  A  more complete representation of this would indicate the place of publication and co-publishing details.

It therefore only becomes worthwhile if the resulting benefits are sufficiently large, as in e-commerce applications.  Indecs – Modelling book trade data The  indecs  metadata  framework  was  developed  to  provide  a  basis  for interoperability  in  e-commerce:  ‘In  the  indecs  framework,  interoperability means enabling information that originates in one context to be used in another in ways that are as highly automated as possible’  Rust and Bide, 2000, 6 .  Indecs is used to identify and describe items from different data sources. Its use has been incorporated into ONIX, used by publishers for exchange of metadata about their products and for Digital Object Identifiers  DOIs   see Chapter 5 . Indecs centres on four axioms about e-commerce:    Axiom 1: Metadata is critical – In order to trade electronically you need  information about who is trading, what is being traded and the nature of   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 45  DATA MODELLING  45  the transaction. These are all metadata. A common understanding of the metadata elements is necessary for a successful transaction to take place.    Axiom 2: Stuff is complex – An item such as a recording may have many  separate tracks that each carries its own rights. For instance, a recording of a piece of music on a CD may have rights associated with the composer, the publisher, the conductor, the performers, the recording studio, the text used for the sleeve notes and any illustrations that are used for the cover.    Axiom 3: Metadata is modular – Each entity must have its own metadata,  even if they are part of a larger item, if the rights associated with them are to be protected. The modules are linked together as a metadata network.     Axiom 4: Transactions need automation – For e-commerce to work, it is  important that local data standards and systems are standardised. This opens the way for automation of rights transactions and makes it possible to handle the very large volume of requests that would come in to a rights holder.  The indecs framework has defined metadata elements, each of which has an indecs identifier or iid. The indecs framework can be used to model the relationships between entities. Indecs is based on the premises that: ‘People make stuff’, ‘People use stuff’ and ‘People do deals about stuff’  Figure 3.8 .  people  stuﬀ  do  about  make  used by  deals  Figure 3.8 Indecs model   More complex models can be developed to reflect detailed transactions and to represent the intellectual property rights associated with works, known as ‘stuff’  in  the  model.  This  modelling  tool  forms  the  basis  of  ONIX,  an  e- commerce system for the publishing industry which is covered later in this chapter and described in greater detail in Chapter 9.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 46  46 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  OAIS – Online exchange of data The Open Archival Information System  OAIS  was developed to provide a functional and information model of information preservation for access and use by a designated community of consumers  Lavoie, 2004 . The OAIS model encompasses a range of information from that which is regularly updated, to that  which  has  periodic  updates  and  from  simple  access  systems  to sophisticated access sys tems and deals with the highly distributed nature of many information systems. The simple model  Figure 3.9  is based on the idea that  information  from  a  producer  is  input  to  the  OAIS  archive  which  is managed  and  provides  output  for  consumers  such  as  the  designated commun ity that it was intended for.   The information is pack aged with a ‘wrapper’ of package information about  which  description  infor mation  is  available.  The  package  contains Content Information and Preservation Description Information  PDI   see Figure 3.10 . The PDI has a number of attributes  CCSDS, 2012 :    provenance – source of the content information, including its custody and    context – relationship of the content to other information outside the    reference – identifiers such as ISBNs  for books    fixity – which provides protection against undocumented alteration e.g.  history  package  check sum.

The Submission Information Package  SIP  is sent by the Producer to an OAIS archive. It will contain some content and some Preservation Description Information  PDI . One or more SIPs are transformed into an Archival Information Package  AIP  which conforms to the internal architecture of the OAI archive. It will have a complete set of PDI for the Content Information. When a consumer makes a request for information the OAIS will produce a Dissemination Information Package  DIP  in response.

Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 48  48 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  Conclusion This chapter described how standards for metadata developed along different paths to fit in with the requirements of different communities. A number of data modelling systems or frameworks have been developed for describing metadata.  The ABC Ontology is a general framework for developing domain-specific descriptions and provides a way of describing different ontologies using a common language. The Resource Description Framework  RDF  is a way of modelling and describing metadata and can be expressed in a number of languages, including HTML, XML, and Turtle  Terse RDF Triple Language . Its syntax is based on triples, subject – predicate – object, so that, for example, the book The Hound of the Baskervilles  subject  has creator  predicate  ‘Arthur Conan Doyle’  object . A third model, the Library Reference Model  LRM , is more specific, providing a framework for describing products of intellectual and artistic effort, such as books and sound recordings. Indecs, the fourth modelling system described, focuses on the entities and transactions that occur in a commercial publishing environment. OAIS, an information model for digital archives, is used for online exchange of data.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 49  CHAPTER 4 Metadata standards  Overview This chapter looks at the structure of metadata standards. Understanding the way in which standards are created and how they are constructed gives us an insight into their use and potential applications to different situations. Metadata standards have arisen in different collections and user communities and some of the main metadata standards are described. This is not intended to be a comprehensive survey but rather an overview of the range of metadata standards on offer with pointers to further information about specialist standards. It starts with a description of Dublin Core, which is probably the most widely used standard, partly because of its simplicity and partly because it was designed  for  web  resources.  It  illustrates  some  of  the  main  features  of  metadata standards and is itself used as the basis for specialist standards and application profiles. The chapter goes on to consider some of the standards that are used in the library and information field for bibliographic materials and social media. It also describes metadata standards used for non-textual materials.   The nature of metadata standards Metadata standards allow for exchange of data and by doing so ensure the future usability of information resources. By having a documented standard, it is possible for future users of the metadata to understand the conventions in place and the intentions behind the metadata. Declared standards are an important tool for controlling the quality of data about information resources. Agreed conventions for generating content and for analysing resources in order to describe them means that there is greater consistency. This allows   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 50  50 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  for interoperability, so that metadata can be exchanged between applications and institutions. It also helps users by enabling them to confidently search metadata collections, knowing where metadata such as dates, creator names, and title information is held. Metadata can also be repurposed for use in new environments and contexts. The growth of linked data has been an example of extensive re-use of metadata collections. A model of the world and the relationship between resources and other entities are implied by metadata standards, which is why a prior understanding of data modelling  covered in Chapter 3  is essential.  There  is  a  process  for  creating  standards  based  on  international  co- operation and consensus. Although proprietary standards have persisted in internal use by some database applications, most organisations that create metadata use established, external metadata standards. In some cases they may adapt existing standards to create their own application profiles. In the UK, British Standard BS0 establishes the terminology of standard making and provides  a  framework  for  development  of  national   and  by  extension international  standards  BSI, 2011 .  Standards arise in a number of ways. They may be created by an enterprise and become a de facto standard for an industry. It is thought that the invention of the standard screw gauge by Sir Joseph Whitworth in 1841 contributed to the industrial revolution and was soon adopted in the naval and railway industries  Galloway, 1958, 637–8 . They may be imposed, for example by a government agency, or they might be developed through a formal process of consultations and consensus among interested bodies, as generally applies for  national  and  international  standards.  The  International  Standards Organization defines a standard in the following terms:   A standard is a document that provides requirements, specifications, guidelines or characteristics that can be used consistently to ensure that materials, products,  ISO, 2015  processes and services are fit for their purpose.   The British Standards Institution provides an overview of standardisation, including the terminology used and guidelines for standards development  BSI,  2011 .  Although  metadata  standards  are  long-established  in  some communities,  in  others  standards  have  only  started  to  emerge  relatively recently. Some domains, such as social media and digital humanities, are relatively  recent  and  the  associated  metadata  standards  may  be  less established.  Standards  for  non-textual  material  are  also  considered.  For example, there are established and emerging metadata standards for digital images, movies and sound files.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 51  METADATA STANDARDS  51  Specific standards are discussed in detail under the application area or purpose that they are most closely aligned to. For instance, Chapter 7 on the management of information resources includes a description of PREMIS, a standard widely used for capturing the data associated with preservation of digital  materials.  Another  example  of  this  approach  can  be  seen  in  the description of ONIX, which is widely used for exchange of bibliographic data by the book trade, in Chapter 9.  About standards Metadata standards provide a framework for analysing information resources so that they can be effectively managed and easily retrieved. The standards identify the characteristics of a resource that are recorded and sometimes specify the way in which the metadata content is created  encoding schemes are  covered  in  Chapter  12 .  In  effect  the  metadata  standard  provides containers for particular types of information. For instance, in Dublin Core the dc:creator data element, which is defined in the standard for Dublin Core Metadata Element Set  ISO, 2009b , provides a place for author name, or organisation responsible for the creation of that resource. The resource could be a web page or it could be a book catalogued in a library, for instance.  Dublin Core – a general-purpose standard The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative  DCMI  was set up in the 1990s following a  series  of  international  workshops.  It  brought  together  members  of  the library  and  computing  communities  in  order  to  address  some  of  the information management issues arising from the emerging world wide web. The  initiative  started  in  Dublin,  Ohio,  which  is  where  OCLC   Online Computer Library Center  an early supporter of this initiative, is based. Its focus continues to be on web and internet usage and it is international in scope. Annual meetings are held in different parts of the world and hosted by participant member organisations  DCMI, 2015 .  Although  Dublin  Core  was  set  up  to  describe  and  improve  the discoverability of web and intranet resources, it has been widely adopted as the  basis  for  metadata  in  other  domains,  particularly  in  the  library  and information field – to allow exchange of basic information and as a basis for interoperability  between  systems   see  Chapter  11  for  a  discussion  of interoperability of metadata . Because of its simplicity it is probably the most widely used metadata standard and the core metadata element set has been documented as an international standard  ISO, 2009b .    Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 52  52 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  The  DCMI  Metadata  Terms  namespace  includes  the  15  core  metadata elements plus many others that are used to describe information resources. Although originally designed for description of internet resources, DCMI terms  are  now  widely  used  for  describing  other  information  resources, including printed materials, electronic documents and other digital resources  DCMI,  2012 .  The  data  elements  correspond  to  fields  in  a  database  or catalogue,  or  properties  in  an  RDF  model.  Although  Dublin  Core  is  a permissive standard  i.e. it does not specify how the content of individual fields is created , it recommends use of controlled vocabularies to generate the content of the data elements. In order to allow backwards compatibility, the  standard  is  expressed  in  such  a  way  that  controlled  vocabularies  or encoding schemes are not mandatory. The core data elements in alphabetic order are:    Contributor – This can be a person, organisation, service or software  agent ‘responsible for making contributions to the resource’. The data type is ‘Agent’, an entity with the power to act.    Coverage – If a resource is about a specific period in history  e.g. Roman Empire, World War II, 1950s  or about a geographic or spatial location  e.g. the dwarf planet Pluto, the State of São Paulo in Brazil, or the City of Westminster in London, or the geographic co-ordinates 38.8977  N, 77.0366  W – also known as 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, or The White House , this can be recorded in the ‘coverage’ data element. This data element can be qualified as dc:coverage.temporal or as dc:coverage.spatial. The data element can also be used to indicate the geographical extent of the applicability of the resource. For instance, regulatory or legislative material may have a geographical extent.    Creator – The agent responsible for the content of the resource is  normally the dc:creator. This may correspond to an author, or it may be the job title of the person who wrote the content, or the organisation responsible for the content of the resource being described.    Date – The time or range of time during which a specific event in the  lifecycle of a resource takes place is held in this field. It can be qualified to refer to a specific event e.g. dc:date.created. The event may be a future event such as date due for review or disposal. The specification recommends use of an encoding scheme such as W3CDTF to create the date  see Chapter 12 for a discussion of encoding schemes .    Description – This is text that summarises the content of the resource,  such as an abstract or table of contents. For web-based resources this is sometimes taken from the opening paragraph of text on the web page.    Format – This may refer to the file format  e.g. pdf file  for a digital   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 53  METADATA STANDARDS  53  resource or the dimensions or medium of a physical resource  e.g. pbk 18 x 11 cm .     Identifier – A  unique  reference to the resource is held here. Ideally this should be part of a formal identifier system such as DOI, ISBN or URL that uniquely and unambiguously identifies the resource  Chapter 5 describes resource identities and identifiers .    Language – The language in which the resource is expressed is held in  this data element. The language can be described using standards such as the ISO 639 series of two-, three- and four-letter codes  ISO, 2002 . For instance, pt or por for Portuguese. These can be combined with country codes from ISO 3166 to produce more specific language designations  ISO, 2013 . So Brazilian Portuguese is represented by pt-BR and Portuguese from Portugal by pt-PT.    Publisher – The publisher is the agent or entity that makes the resource  available. This is usually an organisation name, but may be the name of a service, or even an individual.    Relation – This data element can be used to contain an identifier for a  resource that is in some way connected to the resource being described. For instance, a web page may be part of a wider site. It is not to be confused with ‘Source’.    Rights – This refers to intellectual property rights such as copyright ownership or access rights  for resources where access is limited to specific groups . For instance, a Creative Commons CC-BY licence  allowing use with attribution  would appear here.    Source – If the resource being described is derived from another resource or information entity, this data element can be used to identify where the content comes from. This could be an identifier for a resource from which the content of the resource being described is derived. For instance, if the resource described is presenting data from another publication, an identifier or bibliographic details of the original source could be included here.    Subject – The content of an information resource can be described using  keywords or classification codes. Dublin Core recommends that a controlled vocabulary is used to obtain suitable subject terms. This could be a general classification system such as UDC  Universal Decimal Classification  or a subject-specific vocabulary such as MeSH  Medical Subject Headings , or even a vocabulary designed for internal use within an organisation.    Title – The name by which the resource is usually referred is held in this field. This would correspond to the title of a book or article, for instance, or it might be the overall heading used for a web page e.g. ‘Google’ for   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 54  54 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  the Google search page, or ‘Library of Congress Home’ for the Library of Congress home page.    Type – The dc:type data element describes the ‘nature or genre of the  resource’. This might be: ‘web page’, ‘text’ etc. The file format or physical medium would be described in the dc:format data element.  Some of the above examples show how a data element can be made more specific by adding a qualifier. This is known as a ‘refinement’. So for instance the dc:coverage data element can have a temporal or a spatial refinement, appearing thus: dc:coverage.temporal or dc:coverage.spatial.  Different communities have emerged in the Dublin Core domain and they have developed further data elements that extend the Dublin Core Metadata Element  Set   DCMI,  2012 .  Dublin  Core  is  adaptable  and  supports  the development  of  application  profiles.  A  Dublin  Core  Application  Profile  DCAP  incorporates elements of DC and data elements from other metadata standards  and  namespaces  or  using  specialised  vocabularies  to  create  a standard for specific applications or requirements  Coyle and Baker, 2009; Malta and Baptista, 2014 . A DCAP is defined by:    functional requirements   domain model   description set profiles and usage guidelines   syntax guidelines and data formats.  The Singapore Framework  discussed in Chapter 12  shows the relationship between these  Nilsson, Baker and Johnston, 2008 . There are groups for the DC-Library Application Profile and the DC-Education Application Profile.   Metadata standards in library and information work We can see from the description in Chapter 1 of the origins of cataloguing in ancient  Middle  Eastern  civilisations  that  the  library  and  information profession has a long history of creating and managing metadata.  Resource Description and Access  RDA  The introduction of the Resource Description and Access  RDA  cataloguing standard has profoundly changed the way in which bibliographic data is created, managed and used  Joint Steering Committee for Development of RDA, 2014 . Other long-established standards for exchange of library data such as MARC have also played an important role in the development of   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 55  METADATA STANDARDS  55  metadata standards for digital resources  Library of Congress, 2017c .  Chapter  3  describes  the  way  in  which  the  FRBR  model   Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records, now a part of LRM  of bibliographic data based on four levels of entity has been applied to information resources  IFLA, 1998 . The concept of Work, Expression, Manifestation and Item in RDA provides potential benefits to the library community in more efficient cataloguing and to users by delivering searches of related items. There are data elements associated with each of these levels. The main purpose of RDA is to support resource discovery of digital and non-digital resources. It also incorporates the Functional Requirements for Authority Description, FRAD  now a part of LRM , to describe person family, corporate body and place  IFLA, 2013 . In effect, RDA defines data elements for information resources and the syntax for producing content  syntactic encoding scheme .The core elements at manifestation and item level are  Joint Steering Committee for Development of RDA, 2014 :    title   statement of responsibility   edition statement   numbering of serials   production statement   publication statement   distribution statement   manufacture statement   copyright date   series statement   identifier for the manifestation   carrier type   extent.  Up-to-date information can be found on the RSC website  RDA Steering Committee, 2017 .  MARC 21 The MARC standard  MAchine-Readable Cataloguing  emerged in the 1960s, when libraries needed an efficient method of generating multiple catalogue cards for each item. The advent of computerised processing of data allowed for single entry of cataloguing details for multiple outputs for the author-title catalogue and for the classified and subject catalogues. Individual catalogue records were marked up with field designators to indicate the content of each   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 56  56 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  field. A number of national and specialist variations of MARC emerged and ran in parallel until they were brought together in a single standard MARC 21 in the 1990s. It is based on US-MARC and is maintained by the Library of Congress. As the website states, ‘The MARC 21 formats are standards for the representation and communication of bibliographic and related information in machine-readable form’  Library of Congress, 2017c . MARC has been influential in the development of other standards, originally designed to be compatible with AACR2 cataloguing rules and compatible with RDA  Joint Steering Committee for Development of RDA, 2015 . The MODS standard  described below  is a cut-down version of MARC 21. There are MARC 21 formats for:    bibliographic data   holdings data   authority data   classification data   community information.  The  focus  in  this  chapter  is  on  bibliographic  data.  The  fields  in  the bibliographic format metadata are labelled with numbers arranged in blocks, as follows  Library of Congress, 2017c :  0XX = control information, numbers, codes 1XX = main entry 2XX = titles, edition, imprint 3XX = physical description, etc. 4XX = series statements  5XX = notes  6XX = subject access fields 7XX = name, etc., added entries or series; linking 8XX = series added entries; holdings and locations 9XX = reserved for local implementation.  X00 = personal names X10 = corporate names X11 = meeting names X30 = uniform titles X40 = bibliographic titles  The 1XX, 4XX, 6XX, 7XX and 8XX tags in the bibliographic format can be modified by the following digits to give them a more specific meaning:   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 57  METADATA STANDARDS  57  X50 = topical terms X51 = geographic names.  For instance, this means that the tag 100 would contain personal names – such as an author name, whereas 110 would indicate a corporate author.   100 1_ 110 2_  a Amado, Jorge, d 1912-2001. a European Court of Human Rights.  Full guidance on use of MARC 21 for resources in bibliographic format can be found on the Library of Congress Website: www.loc.gov marc bibliographic.  BIBFRAME BIBFRAME, the Bibliographic Framework, is described in the following terms:   BIBFRAME provides a foundation for the future of bibliographic description, both on the web, and in the broader networked world that is grounded in Linked  Library of Congress, 2017a  Data techniques.  BIBFRAME  is  intended  to  address  some  of  the  shortcomings  of  MARC, particularly with respect to RDA. Figure 4.1 shows the BIBFRAME 2.0 model,  Figure 4.1  BIBFRAME 2.0 model  source: Library  of Congress, 2017    Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 58  58 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  which describes the relationship between three levels of abstraction: Work, Instance and Item. It also shows their relationships with the three core classes: ‘Agent’, ‘Subject’ and ‘Event’.  BIBFRAME  uses  RDF  classes  and  properties  to  describe  bibliographic resources and the relationships between resources. The extensive BIBFRAME vocabulary can be grouped in broad categories as follows:    general properties   category properties   title information   work identification information   work description information   subject term and classification information   instance description statements   instance identification information   instance description information   carrier description information   item information   type information   cataloguing resource relationships – general   cataloguing resource relationships – specific   cataloguing resource relationships – detailed   agent information   administration information.  Metadata Object Description Schema  MODS  MODS is a cut-down version of MARC 21 which has been developed for resource discovery via the internet  Library of Congress, 2015b . MARC 21 records can be mapped onto MODS, although the reverse is more difficult, because it involves parsing fields within MODS into separate fields in MARC 21.  The top-level elements in MODS are:    titleInfo   name   typeOfResource   genre   originInfo   language   physicalDescription   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 59  METADATA STANDARDS  59    abstract   targetAudience   note   subject   classification   relatedItem   identifier   location   part   extension   recordInfo.             Some of these elements are container tags with no content, but serve to group together sub-elements. For example   is a container tag with the following sub-elements, which do contain data:  Individual  elements  or  sub-elements  may  have  attributes  such  as  the following:  Language-Related and Other Attributes: lang – xml:lang – script – transliteration – altRepGroup – displayLabel Date Attributes: encoding – point – keydate – qualifier Linking Attributes: ID – xlink  For instance, the following MODS metadata refers to the English translation of a text that was originally in another language  Portuguese :     Gabriela,  clove  and  cinnamon     KBART KBART  Knowledge Bases and Related Tools  is a link-resolving system that enables libraries to link to appropriate copies of electronic publications such as e-journal articles  NISO UKSG KBART Working Group, 2010 .

This means that a library user does not end up being directed to a paywall for publications that his or her library already subscribes to. KBART identifies the fields shown in Table 4.1.

It uses a multi-level model of archives based on Fonds, Sub-fonds, Series, Sub-series and Items, and applies the following principles:    description from the general to the specific   information relevant to the level of description   linking of descriptions   non-repetition of information.  The elements of description  fields or data elements  that are applied to the different levels of archives are grouped together as follows:   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 61  METADATA STANDARDS  61  IDENTITY STATEMENT AREA  Reference code s  Title Date s  Level of description Extent and medium of the unit of description  quantity, bulk, or size   CONTEXT AREA  Name of creator s  Administrative Biographical history Archival history Immediate source of acquisition or transfer  CONTENT AND STRUCTURE AREA  Scope and content Appraisal, destruction and scheduling information Accruals System of arrangement  CONDITIONS OF ACCESS AND USE AREA  Conditions governing access Conditions governing reproduction Language scripts of material Physical characteristics and technical requirements Finding aids  ALLIED MATERIALS AREA  Existence and location of originals Existence and location of copies Related units of description Publication note  NOTES AREA  Note  DESCRIPTION CONTROL AREA  Archivist’s note Rules or conventions Date s  of descriptions   Although there are rules for the creation of the content of these data elements, some  of  them  are  more  narrative  in  nature  and  do  not  use  controlled vocabularies  or  specific  syntactic  encoding  schemes.  Elements  such  as Reference  code  are  based  on  international  country  codes  followed  by  a national reference number and a local reference code and there are clear guidelines for generating the content of other fields as well.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 62  62 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  The International Council on Archives established an Experts Group on Archival Description  EGAD  in 2012 to reconcile four existing archival data models  Gueguen et al., 2013 .  Encoded Archival Description  EAD  EAD is a detailed metadata schema maintained by the Library of Congress  2016a . At the time of writing the third edition was being developed and finalised by the Society of American Archivists. The standard provides a detailed set of tags used for marking up different data elements associated with archival materials. It is designed for use in a digital environment where the metadata is handled by computer applications and is expressed in Relax NG, XML and as a DTD. It is primarily designed to make archival materials retrievable rather than for management or preservation. It is designed to be compatible with ISAD G .  Social media There are several standards widely used for online and social media. Viewing page information by right-clicking on a browser reveals structured metadata embedded in the page. Some of the more common ones are briefly described here.  FOAF The FOAF  friend of a friend  ontology is:  a dictionary of named properties and classes [ . . .] FOAF integrates three kinds of network:    social networks of human collaboration, friendship and association;      representational networks that describe a simplified view of a cartoon universe  in factual terms, and      information networks that use Web-based linking to share independently  published descriptions of this inter-connected world.   Brickley and Miller, 2014   There are three types of entity in FOAF:    Classes – groups to which other classes or agents belong   Agents – entities that perform actions – they may be classes as well   Properties – characteristics of an agent or a class.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 63  METADATA STANDARDS  63  FOAF  statements  in  RDF  define  the  relationships  between  entities.  For example, some personal information about a graduate of a university  or ‘school’  might include the following statements  in this example ‘me’ is defined in a namespace such as http:  mynamespace infome :     David  Haynes   Dr   David   Haynes       In this example the foaf:schoolHomepage would allow a link to be made to other named individuals who have the same foaf:schoolHomepage.  Open Graph protocol The Open Graph protocol is a Facebook metadata language for labelling web resources so that they can be linked to other graph objects on the internet  Facebook, 2014 . The term ‘social graph’  of which the Open Graph protocol is  an  example   was  coined  to  describe  relationships  in  social  networks  Mislove et al., 2007 . It is based on RDFa, which applies mathematical graph theory to the analysis and mapping of relationships between individuals on the  internet.  The  nodes  are  equivalent  to  people  and  the  edges   lines connecting nodes  are equivalent to relationships. Facebook’s Open Graph enables web pages to be turned into graph objects. A web page described in Open Graph will have a minimum of the following properties:  And less-used data elements:  og:title og:type og:image og:url  og:audio og:description og:determiner og:locale og:site_name og:video   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 64  64 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  Twitter hashtags Hashtags are widely used on social networks and microblogging sites by users to enrich the metadata associated with a posting on social media. For example, Twitter users can include hashtags in tweets to signify their content or context. These are indexed by Twitter and are picked up as trending topics. This allows a conference organiser to publicise a hashtag that all attendees at a conference can use when tweeting about the conference. For example, the ISKO  UK  biennial  conference  in  2017  had  the  hashtag  ISKOUK2017. Although there is no formal control of hashtags on most social media sites, they  serve  a  useful  purpose  and  continue  to  be  a  very  popular  way  of publicising events and marking specific topics for wider attention.  Non-textual materials Standards  such  as  MARC  and  MODS,  and  indeed  Dublin  Core,  can  be applied to non-textual materials  Weber and Austin, 2011 . However, there are standards that have been developed specifically for non-textual materials, such as VRA Core, MIX, and IIIF, which are described here.  VRA Core The VRA Core describes works of art, cultural objects and their images, and is maintained by the Library of Congress  Visual Resources Association, 2015 . VRA Core metadata can be embedded in METS  Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standards  documents. The VRA Core has the following fields:    work, collection, or image   agent    culturalContext   date    description    inscription    location   material   measurements    relation   rights    source    stateEdition   stylePeriod    subject   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 65  METADATA STANDARDS  65    technique    textref    title   worktype  Metadata for images in XML  MIX  MIX is one of a suite of metadata standards maintained by the Library of Congress  2011 . It is based on the NISO Z39.87:2006 standard for digital images, which deals with technical image information rather than intellectual property,  provenance  or  preservation  issues   NISO,  2006 .  For  digital photographs a lot of the technical image data is generated by the digital camera and is captured in this metadata standard.  PBCore and EBUCore Broadcasting services have developed several standards based on Dublin Core, including PBCore in the USA and EBUCore in Europe  Corporation for Public Broadcasting, 2011; EBU, 2015 . PBCore is designed for audiovisual material such as TV and radio programmes  Brighton, 2011 . It is an extension of  Dublin  Core  and  the  data  elements  are  grouped  in  four  classes  Corporation for Public Broadcasting, 2011 :    intellectual content   intellectual property   extensions   instantiation.  EBUCore was developed by EBU, the European Broadcasting Union  EBU, 2015 . Some work has gone into developing crosswalks between EBUCore and PBCore so that data in one format can be converted into the other.  Moving Pictures Expert Group  MPEG  Standards such as MPEG-7 are primarily for encoding digital content for moving  pictures,  but  include  some  metadata  which  is  utilised  in  other standards for audiovisual materials.  JPEG2000 JPEG2000 is a group of standards for image coding and compression. Part 2   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 66  66 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  of the standard deals with extensions to the coding data including metadata associated with an image  ISO, 2004a . The metadata is divided into four categories:    image creation metadata – how the image was created, e.g. the camera and    content description metadata – the subject of the image, what it was about   history metadata – what processing was done to the image to reach its  final form and or links to previous versions of the image    intellectual property rights metadata – information about the rights owners,  lens settings  etc.  EXIF EXIF, developed by the Japan Electronic Industries Development Association, overlaps in coverage with JPEG2000 but is independent of format  so that it can also be used for TIFF image files, for instance, EXIF metadata can be embedded in a JPEG or TIFF image. Figure 4.2 shows the general areas of overlap between EXIF and two other commonly used metadata formats that are used for images  Metadata Working Group, 2010, 21 .

IIIF provides standards and APIs that allow digitised images and born-digital image-based resources to be viewed by many different viewers. Examples include  the  University  Viewer  developed  by  Digirati  for  the  Wellcome Library, Mirador Viewer, the British Library’s Georeferencer and e-codices, the virtual manuscript library of Switzerland.  The IIIP Image API enables image servers to handle requests for images and for information about images over the internet. It defines image request parameters such as region  of the image , size, rotation, quality and format. It also delivers image information, including technical properties and rights and licensing properties.  The IIIF Presentation API enables servers and viewers to deliver images to users, by focusing on the structural metadata. It is not intended for resource discovery or content searching within a resource. A resource or digital object may be described in terms of Manifest, Sequence, Canvas and Content  Figure 4.3 . The relationships between these entities are shown in Figure 4.4.  Figure 4.3 IIIF object  source: IIIF Consortium, 2017  Figure 4.4 Relationships between IIIF objects  source: IIIF Consortium, 2017    Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 68  The resource properties are grouped under the following headings:  68 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS    descriptive properties   rights and licensing properties   technical properties   linking properties   paging properties.  The resource structure is described in Table 4.2. Table 4.2 IIIF resource structure  source: IIIF Consortium, 2017   Manifest   Sequence  Canvas  The manifest resource represents a single object and any intellectual work or works embodied within that object. The sequence conveys the ordering of the views of the object. The canvas represents an individual page or view and acts as a central point for laying out the diﬀerent content resources that make up the display.  Image resources Association of images with their respective canvases is done via  Annotation list  Range  Layer  Collection  Paging  annotations. Although normally annotations are used for associating commentary with the thing the annotation’s text is about, the Open Annotation model allows any resource to be associated with any other resource, or parts thereof, and it is reused for both commentary and painting resources on the canvas. For some objects, there may be more than just images available to represent the page. Other resources could include the full text of the object, musical notations, musical performances, diagram transcriptions, commentary annotations, tags, video, data and more. These additional resources are included in annotation lists, referenced from the canvas they are associated with. It may be important to describe additional structure within an object, such as newspaper articles that span pages, the range of non-content- bearing pages at the beginning of a work, or chapters within a book. These are described using ranges in a similar manner to sequences. Layers represent groupings of annotation lists that should be collected together, regardless of which canvas they target, such as all of the annotations that make up a particular translation of the text of a book. Collections are used to list the manifests available for viewing, and to describe the structures, hierarchies or curated collections that the physical objects are part of. The collections may include both other collections and manifests, in order to form a hierarchy of objects with manifests at the leaf nodes of the tree. In some situations, annotation lists or the list of manifests in a collection may be very long or expensive to create. The latter case is especially likely to occur when responses are generated dynamically. In these situations the server may break up the response using paging properties.  The Advanced Association Features are:   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 69  METADATA STANDARDS  69    segments   embedded content   choice of alternative resources   non-rectangular segments   style   rotation   comment annotations   hotspot linking.  IPTC Photo Metadata Standard The IPTC Photo Metadata Standard contains three types of metadata  IPTC, 2014 :    Administrative – identification of the creator, creation date and location,  contact information for licensors of the image, and other technical details.    Descriptive – information about the visual content. This may include  headline, title, captions and keywords. This can be done using free text or codes from a controlled vocabulary.    Rights – copyright information and underlying rights in the visual  content, including model and property rights, and rights usage terms.  The standard is detailed with a core structure  data elements listed below  and an extended structure with more detailed information on intellectual property and some technical details.

Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard  METS  Repositories and research libraries have to deal with complex objects in a variety of formats. It can be difficult to capture all the necessary metadata using a single standard and so the idea of metadata standards for complex digital  objects  has  emerged.  Metadata  standards  such  as  METS  act  as  a container for metadata generated from other schemas  Library of Congress, 2015a . They may include specialist schemas for material in a specific format or covering a specific subject-area. For instance, a METS record may contain MODS  metadata  for  internet  discoverability,  PREMIS  metadata  for preservation information, and JPEG metadata for images that form part of the resource. METS also allows for metadata standards to be used in parallel so that, for instance, a METS record may contain both MODS and Dublin Core metadata about the same resource.  One of the purposes of a METS document is to provide sufficient metadata to allow a complex digital object  for example, an electronic document made up of separate text sections, images and audio files  to be properly described   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 71  METADATA STANDARDS  71  and  rendered  by  a  suitable  software  application  or API.  This  allows  for exchange of digital library objects between repositories. A METS document, expressed in XML, is divided into the following sections:    METS Header – information about the METS document such as creator,  editor, etc.    Descriptive metadata – this may contain metadata extracted from a MARC  record or Dublin Core record extracted from another application. This section may contain parallel sets of metadata for the same resource.    Administrative metadata – information about the digital object file,  including provenance, and intellectual property rights.    File section – a list of the files that make up the digital object.   Structural map – the structure of the digital object and links elements of  the structure and the content files.    Structural links – records hyperlinks between nodes in the structural map.   Behaviour – association between behaviours and content in a digital  object. This may include executable code to implement that behaviour.  OAI-PMH The OAI-PMH  Open Archives Initiative – Protocol for Metadata Harvesting  standard provides a framework for metadata discovery  Lagoze et al., 2002 . This enables service providers to ‘harvest’ metadata from other metadata stores  such  as  institutional  repositories  to  create  a  searchable  index  and repository. Some services also harvest content from other repositories to facilitate faster retrieval. For instance, an institutional repository may collect metadata in a variety of formats: authors inputting Dublin Core metadata, MARC records from the library, LOM metadata from the institutional VLE and DDIs from electronic publications. The institutional repository may also make METS records available to external services Figure 4.5 on the next page illustrates the process.  Dublin Core provides a ‘common currency’ for exchange of data about internet resources. However, many consider it too crude for dealing with the type of bibliographic material held in institutional repositories. MODS is based on MARC and provides more detailed bibliographic data. It can be generated from MARC records, such as those held on library management systems,  and  so  facilitate  exchange  of  data  between  systems.  Figure  4.6 illustrates the relationship between institutional repositories and resource discovery systems. The service provider builds up a database of metadata  and  sometimes  the  resources  themselves   harvested  from  institutional repositories. It serves queries to the institutional repositories when an item is   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 72  72 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  identified  during  a  user-initiated  search.  The  provider  then  delivers  the retrieval item to the user.

Even in full-time courses with face-to-face lectures, tutorials and practical sessions, blended learning is the norm. This means that students are exposed to a wide range of digital materials in different formats.    Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 73  METADATA STANDARDS  73  IEEE LOM and its derivatives  such as ANZ-LOM  define data elements to describe a learning object  IEEE Computer Society, 2002 . These elements are arranged into nine categories, as follows:  1 General – describes the learning object as a whole 2 Lifecycle – history and current state of the learning object 3 Meta-metadata – information about the metadata instance 4 Technical – technical requirements for the learning object 5 Educational – educational characteristics of the learning object 6 Rights – intellectual property rights and conditions of usage 7 Relation – relationships with other learning objects 8 Annotation – comments on educational use of the learning object 9 Classification – classifications applied to the learning object.  IEEE LOM metadata can be used in SCORM- and IMS-compliant digital learning materials. SCORM  Sharable Content Object Reference Model  is a set of standards and guidelines for learning objects that meet the following functional requirements:    accessibility   interoperability   durability   re-usability.  The IEEE Learning Object Metadata standard  IEEE Computer Society, 2002  and similar systems were intended to allow interchangeability of course material. It was based on an assumption that it should be possible to construct courses from pre-existing units and course material rather that writing from scratch. In practice that objective has eluded educators. This may be because course material is much more dynamic than many people acknowledged. Most academics update their material at least annually. They also work hard to  make  each  course  a  coherent  whole  rather  that  an  accumulation  of disjointed  elements.  Where  things  have  changed  is  the  growth  of  online learning environments – particularly the freely available courses such as Coursera, EdX and the Khan Academy. These are examples of MOOCs – Massive Open Online Courses. Universities and consortia of universities have set up these online courses, covering a wide range of subjects. A variety of metadata on the courses is available for searching or display. This means it is possible to search or navigate by subject, level and institution. Examination of  the  landing  pages  of  courses  from  the  three  largest  providers  reveals extensive use of social media metadata such as Open Graph, Facebook and   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 74  74 PART I METADATA CONCEPTS  Twitter. However, Miranda and Ritrovato  2014  identified Dublin Core, IMS and IEEE LOM as widely used metadata standards for course material.   Conclusion This chapter has provided an overview of some of the most commonly used metadata standards in different domains of activity. It shows the relationships between metadata standards and the domains in which they are used. The choice of standards was also dictated by the use of widely accepted standards as the basis for derived standards or application profiles based on national need.  Dublin  Core  was  introduced  as  a  general-purpose  standard,  even though it was designed primarily to describe online resources and web pages, specifically. We then considered standards that were applicable to LIS work, such as KBART, RDA, MARC 21 and MODS and archives – ISAD G  and EAD.  Metadata  standards  such  as  FOAF,  the  Open  Graph  Protocol  and Twitter hashtags were discussed in the context of social media standards. An overview of standards for non-textual resources include VRA Core, MIX, PBCore, JPEG and EXIF. Finally, complex objects that might include materials in  a  variety  of  digital  formats  were  covered  by  METS,  OAI-PMH   for exchange of metadata  and learning object metadata such as IEEE LOM.  Although some standards have persisted for a long time, Dublin Core since 2006,  IEEE  LOM  since  2002  with  minor  amendments,  other  significant changes are afoot. At the time of writing RDA had been implemented in several national libraries, including the British Library, and the Library of Congress. Other national libraries and many academic libraries are in the process of implementing RDA  RDA Steering Committee, 2017 .  Long-established mark-up systems such as MARC were under scrutiny with the proposed BIBFRAME replacement being developed at the Library of Congress.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 75  PART II Purposes of metadata One of the organising principles of the first edition of this book was that metadata  could  be  categorised  by  purpose.  The  original  five  purposes reflected the preoccupations of information professionals in the early 2000s. Many of these purposes have stood up to scrutiny and Part II builds on that model, but with six purposes. This part of the book starts with resource identification  and  description   Chapter  5   as  before.  Chapter  6  looks  at information retrieval and the impact that metadata has on it. It necessarily discusses retrieval theory moving beyond the measures of precision and recall that were discussed in the first edition. This part then moves on to ‘Managing information  resources’   Chapter  7   and  looks  at  the  role  of  metadata  in managing the information lifecycle. Chapter 8 considers intellectual property rights, including provenance. Previously there was a chapter on e-commerce and  this  has  been  developed  into  a  description  of  the  role  of  metadata supporting e-commerce and e-government  Chapter 9 . It is illustrated with examples from the book trade  ONIX , e-learning environments and research data  including ‘big data’ . The final chapter in Part II is about information governance  Chapter 10 , dealing with ethical and regulatory issues. Risk is used as a lens through which to view regulation and governance.

It  then  considers  how resource description is used to distinguish between different information resources. Some widely used identifiers such as ISBNs, DOIs, ISSNs, ISTCs and ISANs are described. ‘Description’ underpins other purposes such as retrieval and rights management. The chapter then looks at other metadata used for describing information resources by considering in turn: title; creator; bibliographic citation; date; format; and description.  How do you identify a resource? Hider talks about metadata in terms of describing information resources, the primary purpose of which is to facilitate information access and use. He goes on to discuss data elements:  Each element describes an aspect or attribute of the information resource [. . .] Clearly some attributes are more relevant in the provision of information access than are others.   Hider, 2012, 15   He  makes  the  point  that  metadata  used  to  describe  a  resource  is  a representation of that resource. Taking this argument further, an identifier can be seen as an extreme form of representation of a resource – reducing it to a single sequence of digits or characters in a code. In effect an identifier could act as a surrogate for the resource, although they are more usually handled as labels for the resource.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 78  78 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  Identifiers A fundamental requirement of any description system is to have a way of uniquely identifying an item, so that it is clear what is being described. This is  a  particular  concern  in  online  records  management,  where  there  are different levels of aggregation. Is the resource being described as a single document, a series of documents on a particular topic, or a collection of items? For a small collection, an identifier could simply be the title of a book or piece of music. However, with even quite modest collections ambiguity becomes a significant issue, as when two different books share the same title, or where the same work may have different versions of the title  as with translated works . Identifiers such as ISBNs can be used to distinguish between them, although because ISBNs are assigned to manifestations rather than works, they are not a reliable way of disambiguating two titles. Additional metadata such as Author would be needed to distinguish between two works. For instance, a search for the book title The Outsider in a public library catalogue might retrieve the following items:  Albert Camus. The Outsider.  translation by Stuart Gilbert of L’Étranger into English . London: Hamish Hamilton, 1946 – absurdist novel about a murderer, set in French Algeria  Chris Culver. The Outsider. ISBN 9780751549126. London: Sphere, 2013 – a detective novel set in the United States Geordan Murphy. The Outsider. ISBN 9781844882793. Dublin: Penguin Ireland, 2012 – autobiography of an Irish rugby player Colin Wilson. The Outsider. ISBN 0753814323. London: Phoenix, 1956  2001 printing  – a social psychology text on alienation  An ISBN alone may not be sufficient to identify an item. The first item in the above listing predates the ISBN system, for instance. The last item was pub lished before the 13-digit ISBNs came into effect. It may also be necessary to distinguish between several copies of a title in a lending library or between individual items of stock in a publisher’s warehouse. An identification system can be used for this as well. In both instances the identifier should be unique at some level  title, edition, or item for instance  and unambiguous. Some works may have several identifiers such as different identifiers for hardback and paperback editions of a book. Translations present a particular problem because a translation could be regarded as a separate work as well as an expression of the work in the original language. It is important to understand what is being identified. The FRBR model for bibliographic items allows for different levels of granularity of information resource based on a multi-layer model comprising:   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 79  RESOURCE IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION  PURPOSE 1   79  Works – e.g. The Dust Diaries by Owen Sheers  Expressions – e.g. the text of the work   Manifestations – e.g.  hardback edition, published by Faber & Faber in 2004. ISBN 0571210163 paperback edition, published by Faber & Faber in 2005. ISBN 0571210260  Items – such as particular copies of the  book in the British Library or in the Library at SOAS, University of London, identified  by accession numbers  In the above example we see identifiers applied at each level from the author– title  catalogue  entry  for  the  work,  to  the  manifestations  of  that  work represented by ISBNs. A digital object identifier  DOI  could play the same role as identifier for a digital item. At the item level a library accession number would identify an individual copy.  URLs  universal resource locators  are commonly used to identify web pages; they are used throughout this book, for instance, to provide a reference trail  for  those  seeking  further  information  or  background  about  specific topics. However, URLs describe the location of an electronic resource on the internet. In most cases this happens to coincide with the actual resource and so  is  effectively  used  as  though  it  were  a  resource  identifier.  However, websites change and the content at a particular address may disappear or be replaced. This is one reason for giving the date accessed when citing a URL. In other words, URLs are not necessarily persistent. The concept of a Uniform Resource Identifier incorporates Universal Resource Names and Universal Resource Locations  Berners-Lee, Fielding and Masinter, 2005 . A URI may be a URN that identifies a specific resource, but not how to access it, and or a  URL  such  as  a  web  address  which  points  to  a  specific  location  on  the internet. In other words an ISBN and a URL are examples of URIs.  Name  authorities  –  for  many  years  libraries  have  developed  name authorities following AACR2, and now RDA  Joint Steering Committee for Development of RDA, 2014 . Archivists have also developed a system for a name authority, ISAAR  CPF  for Corporate Bodies, Persons and Families  International Council on Archives, 2004 , which is used in several countries. Name authorities ensure the consistency of catalogues and help to eliminate ambiguity, one of the reasons for identification systems.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 80  80 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  UUIDs and EANs Two general systems have emerged for identification of items and objects, the EAN   International Article  Number   and  UUID,  the  Universally  Unique Identifiers  ITU-T, 2014 . Although not specifically designed for information resources, they can be applied to digital and physical resources, such as e- journals and printed books.  UUIDs operate on the basis of 16-octet numbers, the equivalent to a 128-bit code. This yields such a large set of potential numbers to choose from that the chance that any one number will be allocated to more than one object or item is vanishingly small. The 16-octet number is represented by 32 hexadecimal digits which are arranged in 5 groups separated by hyphens, making a total of 36  characters  needed  to  represent  a  UUID.  There  are  2128 or  1632 possible numbers to choose from. This is equivalent to approximately 3.4 x 1038 possible numbers. Because there are so many UUID numbers available, they can be applied to very large numbers of very small entities such as file locations on a hard  disc  or  individual  devices  on  the  internet.  They  can  be  applied  to ephemeral entities such as transaction IDs as well as to more persistent objects. The  standard  includes  a  number  of  recommendations  for  algorithms  for generating UUIDs, to help ensure that they are unique. These include name- based hashing, date- and time-based coding, and pseudo-random number generation. An example of a numeric, pseudo-randomly generated UUID is:  a4739b4f-2077-4594-b8b3-2cfa70a41d5d  Note: This code was automatically generated from the UUID Generator website: www.uuidgenerator.net . Each character  0-9 and a-f  represents a hexadecimal  base-16  digit.   EAN codes are used for physical objects and consist of a 13-digit code which can be used to create a barcode  GS1, 2015 . The EAN has retained its former acronym, which stood for European Article Number, even though it is now international in scope. These are the barcodes commonly seen on books and magazines, and in the case of books correspond to the 13-digit ISBN, which always starts with the 978 EAN code.  ISBN  International Standard Book Number  The first ISBN standard was published by ISO in 1970 and since then ISBNs have been widely adopted by the publishing, book and library sectors  ISO, 2009a . It provides a way of uniquely identifying monographs and other non- serial  publications   ISO,  2005 .  A  different  ISBN  is  allocated  to  each manifestation of a title, so for instance the paperback version of a book will   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 81  RESOURCE IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION  PURPOSE 1   81  have its own ISBN and the e-book will have a distinct and separate ISBN. For example, each hardback edition of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets would have its own ISBN as would each paperback edition. However, ISBNs can be mis-assigned or can be inadvertently re-used, so they are not always reliable identifiers. ISBNs originally consisted of a 10-digit code. Since 2007 ISBNs  have  consisted  of  a  13-digit  code  with  the  following  elements  International ISBN Agency, 2014 :    EAN.UCC prefix – 3-digit number allocated by EAN International, which  is always 978 for ISBNs     Registration group element – which identifies the national, geographic,  language or other grouping within which the ISBN Agency allocating the number operates. It is variable in length.    Registrant element – indicates the publisher and varies in length according  to the projected output of the publisher    Publication element – allocated by the publisher for the publication. The  length of this element will depend on the length of the registrant element and the registration group that precedes it    Check digit – based on a modulus 10 algorithm and providing a simple  way of checking the validity of a number, helping to identify transcription errors, etc.  In order to manage the allocation of ISBNs, publishers are required to submit ISBN metadata, including the following  International ISBN Agency, 2012 :  ISBN Product form Title Series Contributor Edition Language s  of text Imprint Publisher name and contact details Country of publication Publication date ISBN of parent publication  Digital Object Identifier  DOI  Digital Object Identifiers  DOIs  are used for identifying intellectual content   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 82  82 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  in a digital environment. DOIs are co-ordinated by the International DOI Foundation via a network of national agencies. ‘The Digital Object Identifier  DOI  was conceived as a generic framework for managing identification of content  over  digital  networks,  recognising  the  trend  towards  digital convergence and multimedia availability’  International DOI Foundation, 2012 . It is intended to form the basis for e-commerce. They are designed for ‘Interoperability with other data from other sources’, especially those related to intellectual property items such as music recordings, written work or museum artefacts  International DOI Foundation, 2012 . The specification for DOI  can  also  be  found  in  the  ISO  26324  standard   ISO,  2012b .  The functionalities of DOIs is expressed in the following terms:  The DOI system offers a unique set of functionalities:    Persistence, if material is moved, rearranged, or bookmarked;   Interoperability with other data from other sources;    Extensibility by adding new features and services through management of     Single management of data for multiple output formats  platform   groups of DOI names;  independence ;    Class management of applications and services;   Dynamic updating of metadata, applications and services.    International DOI Foundation, 2012   All DOIs start with the prefix 10, from the Handle System, followed by an alphanumeric   letters  and  digits   of  any  length  to  identify  the  registrant organisation  Sun, Lannom and Boesch, 2003 . A forward slash separates the prefix and the suffix, which is assigned to the entity or digital object itself. The suffix may incorporate existing identifiers such as ISBNs. Once assigned, a DOI is persistent – in other words it does not change, even if the ownership changes.  The DOIs are based on three components: resolution, metadata and policy. A DOI can be resolved into associated values such as URLs, other DOIs and other metadata. A digital object with a DOI may have an associated URL, an internet location  which is not necessarily persistent . The entity associated with the DOI can be moved to another internet location or URL without the need to change the DOI. The DOI can be resolved into multiple values, as we see in the following example of four sets of associated data:  DOI:10.1004 123456 URL: www.pub.com   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 83  RESOURCE IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION  PURPOSE 1   83  URL: www.pub2.com DLS: loc repository  International Standard Serial Number  ISSN  ISSNs  International Standard Serial Numbers  are administered nationally and co-ordinated by the ISSN International Centre in Paris. The standard, ISO 3297:2007, explains the syntax for ISSNs  ISO, 2007 . The ISSN consists of an eight-digit number, the first seven digits being the unique number allocated to each registered serial title and the last being a check digit  based on a Modulus 11 calculation . The ISSN is presented as two groups of four digits separated  by  a  hyphen,  to  prevent  confusion  with  other  international standard numbers such as ISBNs. Approximately 2 million ISSNs had been issued by 2017. Serials are registered with the relevant national ISSN agency, which will require the following  ISSN International Centre, 2017 :  title frequency publisher’s name medium, etc.  ISAN – International Standard Audiovisual Number The International Standard Audiovisual Number, ISAN, is a voluntary system intended for use by the audiovisual industry to uniquely identify any work  ISO 15706:2002 + A1:2008 . It serves a number of purposes:  An International Standard Audiovisual Number  ISAN  identifies an audiovisual work throughout its life and is intended for use wherever precise and unique identification of an audiovisual work would be desirable. As an identifier, it may be used for various purposes, such as to assist allocation of royalties among right holders, to track the use of audiovisual works, for information retrieval and for anti-piracy purposes, such as verifying title registrations.    ISO, 2008   The ISAN consists of 16 hexadecimal digits, the first 12 of which are unique to  each  audiovisual  work  and  the  remaining  4  being  reserved  for  part numbers. Machine-readable versions of the number have a check digit added. The ISAN is applied to a work and all its manifestations in different media, unlike  ISSNs,  which  are  unique  to  each  form  of  a  serial.  A  proposed development is V-ISAN, which will incorporate information about the version of the audiovisual work.

It consists of a 13-digit code made up as follows:  EAN prefix – 979 for all ISMN items Leading 0 followed by Publisher ID Item ID Check digit  This conforms with the EAN system, which means that music publications can have barcodes based on the ISMN.  ISTC – International Standard Text Code According to ISO 21047:2009:  The ISTC provides a means of uniquely and persistently identifying textual works in information systems and of facilitating the exchange of information about those textual works between authors, agents, publishers, retailers, libraries, rights administrators and other interested parties, on an international level.   ISO, 2009c .   The code is made up of eight hexadecimal digits, as follows  International ISTC Agency 2010, 9 :    registration element   year element   textual work element   check digit.  The ISTC provides a way of identifying text which may be incorporated into a serial publication or which may be manifest as a book. For instance, a work with its own ISTC may correspond to several publications  manifestations of the work , each with its own ISBN  Figure 5.1 opposite .  Archival Resource Key  ARK  The Archival Resource Key is a system for persistent identifiers based on URLs. An ARK reference takes the form shown in Figure 5.2  Kunze, 2003 .

Radio-Frequency IDentity  RFID  tags were invented in 1948, based on the idea that they can be attached to goods and materials and can be used for identifying  and  tracking  individual  items.  RFIDs  are  used  in  the  retail industry  and  have  the  potential  to  be  applied  to  individual  retail  items, components of those items, or at a macro level to pallets of those items, as part of a logistics system, for instance. In libraries RFID tags are attached to books, DVDs and other materials, and are used for security and circulation control. With such a wide range of applications a number of standards have emerged. The libraries version of the RFID standard is specified in ISO 28560- 2:2014 and is intended for use in all types of library  ISO, 2014b .  As RFIDs have developed, so their data-holding capacity has increased and it is now possible to include significant amounts of data about the object to   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 86  86 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  which  the  RFID  is  attached.  Where  the  object  represents  an  information resource, the data on the RFID is effectively metadata. RFIDs allow library users to check out books for themselves, and to check them back in when they have finished with them. The RFID code uses identifiers based on accession numbers  assigned  to  each  individual  item.  Some  libraries  still  rely  on  a barcoding system for circulation control, and some use both: RFID for security and barcodes for self-checking of items.  Describing resources The six-point model of the purposes of metadata introduced in Chapter 1 started  with  resource  description,  which  is  the  most  fundamental  of  all metadata purposes. It has its origins in the emergence of library catalogues and at its most basic is a way of identifying works. Adequate description is an essential prerequisite for information retrieval and resource discovery  Chapter 6 . It also underpins the other applications of metadata. Without a way  of  identifying  and  describing  a  resource,  it  is  impossible  to  use  the associated metadata for other purposes.  For example, in a web search  known generically as resource discovery or information retrieval , some kind of description is needed for retrieved items to evaluate the search results and to have an idea of whether the required item has been retrieved. Another example would be in a library. A search of a library catalogue that only yielded accession numbers would not be useful for most searchers. Descriptive data such as the title, author or the format of the item would normally be needed in order to evaluate the items and to make a decision about its relevance and therefore whether to order, borrow, reserve or consult the item.  A single data element may not be sufficient to distinguish between items. A search for the author ‘Maya Angelou’, for instance, would probably bring up several works. In order to select the appropriate item, a wider description than just the name of the author would be needed to assess its relevance. The book title I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings may then provide the additional descriptive information that helps a reader to evaluate the retrieved item for relevance and enables that person to distinguish between it and other books by the same author such as Gather Together in my Name, or The Heart of a Woman.  It may not always be clear how complete a description is needed in a given situation. One extreme would be to use the entire item as the description. So for instance, the entire text of a book could be used to describe the contents of the book. In effect this is what happens with web pages or repositories of electronic  journals  or  e-books.  The  entire  text  is  available  for  searching.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 87  RESOURCE IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION  PURPOSE 1   87  However, even this may not be complete, because it will not include metadata elements that describe its context or what has happened to it during its life. It also may not include external, independent descriptions of the item, which may themselves be useful sources of data about the book, such as a critical review, or a third-party abstract in a bibliographic database. The biggest drawback of the complete text is its length – often making it impractical as a source of information for rapid evaluation. This is why description metadata is used as a surrogate for the full item.  Characteristics of metadata elements There are many different systems for describing resources and they can be grouped together by resource type, e.g. digital versus printed text, or text versus images, or complex digital objects such as VLE resources. They vary in complexity from the 15 data elements of the Dublin Core through to the descriptions allowed for in RDA such as Title proper, Other title information, Statement of responsibility and Summarisation of content.   Not all the data elements describe the intrinsic qualities of the information resource. This section concentrates on those that do and looks at how they handle resource description. The actual data elements used will depend on the  resources  being  described  and  might  include  bibliographic  items  electronic and printed , music, images, text, archives and virtual learning materials. Intrinsic metadata is about qualities of the resource itself such as its title, the author, and content description. On the other hand, applied metadata may be contextual, describing how the item relates to other items, or dynamic attributes such as ownership. The applied metadata may be about the  intended  use  of  the  resource.  For  example,  the  ‘Audience’  metadata element defined by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative shows that a resource is targeted at particular groups, such as undergraduates, researchers or young adults  DCMI Usage Board, 2012 . Similarly, a record of transactions provides another kind of contextual information which could have a bearing on the provenance of a resource. Intrinsic attributes of identifiers are described in the IFLA FRBR report in the following terms:  Attributes, as they are defined in the model, generally fall into two broad categories. There are, on the one hand, attributes that are inherent in an entity, and on the other, those that are externally imputed. The first category includes not only physical characteristics  e.g. the physical medium and dimensions of an object  but also features that might be characterized as labelling information  e.g. statements appearing on the title page, cover, or container . The second category includes assigned identifiers for an entity  e.g. a thematic catalogue number for a   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 88  88 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  musical composition , and contextual information  e.g. the political context in which a work was conceived . Attributes inherent in an entity can usually be determined by examining the entity itself; those that are imputed often require reference to an external source.   IFLA, 1998   Descriptive metadata The following metadata elements  mostly derived from Dublin Core, with the  exception  of  Bibliographic  Citation   are  described  in  terms  of  their relevance to describing resources. Dublin Core elements were chosen as the basis for discussion in this chapter, because of its general nature, widespread use  and  relative  familiarity.  It  has  been  widely  used  as  the  basis  for application  profiles  relevant  to  specific  communities  of  interest.  The descriptive metadata elements could include:  Identifier Title Creator ‘Bibliographic citation’ Date Format Description  Title Although titles are extensively used to identify resources, they are not always descriptive of the content. In web pages, apart from the URL the title is probably the most widely used metadata element and in html it is delimited by the tags   and  . This mark-up is frequently used by search engines and by browsers to establish what is displayed at the top of the web page.   Book titles show considerable variation, depending on whether it is the full title, a common representation of the title, or a particular translation of the original title. This variation can cause confusion in the identification of an information resource unless there is some way to distinguish between them. Consistent cataloguing rules, for instance RDA and the ISBD, provide rules on sources of information  Joint Steering Committee for Development of RDA, 2014; IFLA, 2011 . They can be used to establish which version of the title takes priority, or even how to deal with different title origins. Cataloguers have to deal with questions such as: ‘Does the title of a series of monographs appear before or after the title of the individual monograph?’ They also have to  deal  with  subtitles  and  this  may  provide  additional  confusion  in  the   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 89  RESOURCE IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION  PURPOSE 1   89  description of an item. For example, Charles Darwin’s famous work is often referred to as Origin of Species. Yet when it was originally published in 1859, its full title was: On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. This can cause problems when searching for items in a catalogue and certainly causes confusion when trying to determine which items are relevant.  In the discussion about RDA and LRM in Chapter 3, four different levels of entity were identified, each with its own data elements, including title. A work such as Origin of Species may be expressed as a written book which is manifest in a number of different editions and reprints. In this case they all share the same title and have to be distinguished by other means such as edition,  place  of  publication  and  publisher.  These  will  be  different manifestations of the first edition, which is itself an expression of the original work.  Work: The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection  Expression: Text of the First Edition  Manifestation 1: London: J. Murray, 1859 Manifestation 2: New York, NY: D. Appleton  and company, 1860  Thus, it is possible to see the benefits and limitations of title as a means of describing information. In some contexts it may be sufficient to distinguish between different items; in others it will be one of a number of attributes that in combination provide a sufficiently detailed description of the item to assess its relevance or to uniquely identify it.  Creator Creator  covers  a  wide  range  of  possible  relationships  and  may  imply intellectual property rights such as copyright. For printed publications, the author is usually the ‘creator’ entity. However, it also applies to editors of series of compiled works as well as illustrators and translators.  For web pages the situation can become quite complex. For instance, some organisations do not attribute the content of web pages to named individuals, but to departments or the organisation itself, often for the following reasons:    to protect individuals against harassment – particularly if the content  may be viewed as controversial in some quarters    to indicate corporate responsibility – especially for content written by an  individual or group of individuals in an official capacity   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 90  90 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA    to provide a more reliable point of contact for those who wish to act on the content of the web page – the individual authors may move on, in which case the department may be the more helpful point of contact.  RDA provides a good guide for expressing author names in publications. The citation rules for many refereed journals also have their own conventions for author names. The rules are not so clearly defined for web pages, and the permissive metadata standards used in this arena such as Dublin Core do not specify how a creator’s name should be recorded. The question arises should it be: surname, followed by the initials, or full name, or the title followed by the first name and then the family name? Even in the relatively well defined area of bibliographic records there are variances in author name which can cause problems when it comes to reliable identification of a publication. Different amounts of data may be available for different publications by the same author. In the previous example about Origin of Species, the author could be expressed as:  C. Darwin Charles Darwin C. R. Darwin Charles R. Darwin Charles Robert Darwin Charles Darwin 1809–1882  And then there are the inversions of the surname and given names: Darwin, C. etc. The last example in the list above introduces the dates of Charles Darwin’s lifespan, affording another way of discriminating between this particular  individual  and  other  authors  who  may  share  the  same  name. Where transliteration from a different script is concerned, there is an added level of variation. For instance, is it ‘Tchaikovsky’ or ‘Chaikowski’? Is it ‘Mao Tse-Tung’ or ‘Mao Zedong’?   A name may not be sufficient to distinguish between different authors. For example, the author ‘Steve Jones’ comes in at least three distinct varieties, which becomes clear when the cataloguing data reveals their dates of birth. There is Steve Jones  b. 1944 , the biologist who wrote The Language of the Genes. Biology, history and the evolutionary future; there is Steve Jones  b.1953 , the sports writer and author of Endless Winter: the inside story of the rugby revolution; and there is Steve Jones  b. 1961 , the music critic and author of Rock Formation: music, technology and mass communication. Authority lists which include additional data such as the date of birth provide an added level of specificity and makes identification of items  such as books  more reliable.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 91  RESOURCE IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION  PURPOSE 1   91  Where the creator is an organisation the issue of name change may arise. For instance my own institution, ‘City, University of London’ was previously ‘The City University, London’ and prior to becoming a university was the ‘Northampton College of Advanced Technology’. These kinds of changes can lead to problems with identification and accurate description.   Cataloguers deal with items ‘in hand’, so that the publication details reflect the situation at the point of publication. This can be copy cataloguing, where records  are  obtained  from  an  external  source  and  adapted,  or  original cataloguing, creating records from scratch in-house  Chan and Salaba, 2016, 69 . To some extent authority lists such as those maintained by the Library of Congress   2017b   can  help  with  making  connections  between  different manifestations or expressions of the same work. This is one of the issues that RDA cataloguing is intended to address.   Bibliographic citation The bibliographic citation includes elements already discussed, such as title and creator. However it also includes other distinguishing details such as publisher, place of publication and date of publication. Different types of bibliographic records such as journal articles will also include details of the journal and the volume and issue numbers of the journal. Conventions for citations such as RDA or the multiplicity of conventions used by refereed journals provide rules for the order and format of the citation details. The intention of the citation details is to uniquely identify and help in the location of the resource being described. Again, there must be a consideration of consistency in citation conventions. Some applications such as RefWorks, Endnote bibliographic reference management tool or applications such as Zotero or Mendeley work with generic bibliographic records that can be output in a variety of reference styles such as Harvard, or Modern Languages Association, according to the requirements of the publisher. Even then these conventions may be limited to the order in which items are cited and the punctuation that separates the different data elements.   Date Date  information  occurs  in  a  number  of  contexts.  It  may  be  an  intrinsic property of an information resource – for example, date of creation, date of publication,  date  of  revision.  It  may  also  be  an  externally  imposed  data element  that  has  more  to  do  with  the  management  of  the  resource,  for example web page revision or expiry dates, or review dates for electronic records. Date information can also refer to when something was done to the   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 92  92 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  resource – such as date of disposal, date of change of ownership. This type of date information is not intrinsic to the resource or information container and would not normally be considered to be resource description. However the date of creation or modification is intrinsic and can also be used as part of the identification and description of an item.  Format Format  information  is  particularly  important  for  electronic  information resources and may provide the key to future access to the resource. It is evident in digital images – many of which are created with a great deal of proprietary metadata about: the format; the application and version used to create or modify the image; the storage format; and the medium used to store the data. This descriptive information becomes important when it comes to reconstructing  information  by  means  of  migration  or  by  emulating  the original applications.  Format does not only apply to electronic resources. The format of a printed work may also be relevant and may refer to whether a book is hardcover or paperback, and the physical size of the document, and whether or not it contains illustrations. This type of information is particularly helpful for managing resources. Do the books fit on a standard shelf for instance, or do they have to be kept with the outsize material?  Description On the face of it the ‘Description’ data element  in Dublin Core  is most directly relevant to the purpose of resource description discussed in this chapter. However, descriptive information may not be an intrinsic property of the information resource. An author’s abstract in a journal article or an introduction  from  a  monograph  is  intrinsic,  but  an  externally  produced abstract  or  summary  is  not;  it  is  applied  to  the  resource.  This  becomes particularly relevant in describing physical objects or images, as would be the case in a museum.  There are different approaches to resource description. For example, an external abstract may be enriched with controlled terms to enhance retrieval. Alternatively, it may be purely free text – the most likely outcome of using authors’ abstracts or publishers’ promotional material. The description will depend on the purpose of the abstract and this will inform the approach that should be adopted. Many secondary sources specialise in preparing abstracts on indexed items. The same article may have quite different abstracts which are geared to different audiences. The questions to ask are:   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 93  RESOURCE IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION  PURPOSE 1   93    Does it help users to assess the relevance of a retrieved item?   Does it enhance retrieval – for instance by use of enriching controlled  terms?    Is it intended to sell the item – as in publishers’ promotional material?   Can it be used to evaluate a resource – is this an independent expert’s  commentary or review of the item?  The description data element can therefore be applied to this purpose even though it is not necessarily intrinsic to the resource itself.  Conclusion Description is an application of metadata that underpins other purposes, including authenticity, finding and retrieving information and describing what has to be managed. The actual names of the relevant data elements will vary  according  to  the  schema  used.  Those  that  relate  to  description  of information resources and information-containing artefacts  such as museum objects, digital media and printed documents  fall under the following broad headings:    Identifiers are a fundamental type of descriptor that allows for  discrimination between works or items being described. A number of international standards for identifiers are widely used by a number of metadata schemes. ISBNs, DOI and ISTC standards are all examples of this.    Titles are commonly used to identify resources such as web pages and  printed books. However, the way in which a title is expressed may not be immediately obvious and this can cause problems in identifying relevant items.    Creator covers individuals and organisations and describes different  kinds of activity, from authoring a book through to composing music. Names can be ambiguous and this has resulted in considerable effort being devoted to developing authority lists.    Bibliographic citations depend on consistent cataloguing rules and this is a  theme that is recognised as important for other data elements.   Date of creation is intrinsic to many resources and is part of the  identification and description of an item.     Format applies to both electronic and physical records and helps  managers to decide how best to handle an item.    Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:37  Page 94  94 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA    Description can be intrinsic  e.g. an author’s abstract or summary , or it may be externally applied  e.g. a book review . Description helps in the evaluation and selection of resources.  The data elements used to illustrate the descriptive purpose of metadata area also fulfil other functions such as information retrieval, interoperability and rights management. The level of description required will depend on the context. For instance, a title may be sufficient for a library user to distinguish between different books by an author. A fuller description  in combination with other data elements  may be needed if several titles are being evaluated to inform a purchase decision.   Identifiers are a particularly complex area, there being a variety of different identification systems that can be applied. For instance, an electronic resource may have a DOI, a URL and an ISBN. Other descriptive elements such as title may be applied at the RDA work level or manifestation level. Throughout the discussion on descriptive metadata elements, the theme of consistency has recurred. The adoption of consistent cataloguing rules is one way of uniquely identifying items and forms the basis for the development of authority lists. In the library and archive fields there has been considerable progress in the development of name authority lists that can be used to distinguish between similar-sounding items and to consolidate variations around a party name  such as an author  or information resource  such as an archive or book  for consistent retrieval.  A common theme running throughout the description purpose is the need for consistent encoding  which is covered in Chapter 12 , to ensure a degree of interoperability between items and to help discriminate between items that are relevant and those that are not.

This chapter considers the role of metadata in information retrieval. It begins with a review of  information  retrieval  concepts  and  measures  of  retrieval  performance  before considering  the  impact  of  metadata  on  retrieval.  Reference  is  made  to  models  for resource description and subject indexing. The final part of the chapter examines the relationship between subject indexing and computational methods of retrieval.   The role of metadata in information retrieval Van  Rijsbergen   1979,  1–2   makes  the  distinction  between  information retrieval and data retrieval. Information retrieval looks at the existence or non- existence of a document or information resource that matches the search criteria. This lends itself to document  information resource  descriptions, also known  as  metadata.  Data  retrieval  on  the  other  hand  is  about  obtaining factual answers to a question, although the boundaries are being blurred with the development of fact-based retrieval systems such as Google’s Knowledge Graph. This can also be described in terms of metadata, although here the emphasis is on data dictionaries that define the structure of the database rather than describing document content. The focus of this chapter is on information retrieval rather than data retrieval. This ties in with the overall scope of this book on describing document content. However it does deal with documents of all types from mainly text-based through to multimedia   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 96  96 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  materials. Metadata improves the discoverability of information resources by describing  the  content  in  a  variety  of  ways.  Cochrane   1982   talks  about subject access as being systematic, topical or natural  free-text . The systematic approach  is  via  a  classification  or  taxonomy  which  provides  a  formal language for describing the content of the resource. The topical approach may be subject headings which may be derived from a controlled language or may be free text. The natural approach uses free text or natural language – i.e. text retrieval from the content of the information resource itself. Considerable effort has gone into text retrieval algorithms, primarily to rank the results in a way that is meaningful and relevant to the searcher.  Automatic text analysis can be used for retrieval purposes. The frequency of word occurrence in a set of documents provides a way of ranking search results. Once stop words  such as articles and conjunctions  are stripped out, a plot can be made of word frequency, i.e. words in rank order of frequency of occurrence in the target document. The resolution power of words has been found to be greatest among mid-ranking words. Once the most frequent words  which tend not to be significant  and the least frequent words  which are too specialist  are excluded,  those  in  the  mid-frequency  range  tend  to  be  most  useful  for distinguishing  between  documents  during  a  search   Figure  6.1 ,   van Rijsbergen, 1979, 16 .

Algorithms based on probabilistic models allow search results to be ranked by relevance  or closeness to fit . Although search engines rank results so that the most ‘meaningful’ items appear at the top of the list, they do not solve the problem of differing weights of search terms. Formal descriptions  extracted  from  the  document  or  applied  by  cataloguers  or indexers still play an important role. This is particularly the case for the semantic web, where the context of a descriptor can have a profound effect on retrieval.   Another aspect to consider is the level at which retrieval takes place. This can be at collection level or at the level of individual works, or individual manifestations of that work, or individual items. Collection-level retrieval provides ‘a filtering system that helps reduce users’ data overload’  Zavalina, 2011, 105 . The following types of data element had the greatest effect on collection-level retrieval  in order : Description, Subjects, Title.  Most retrieval is document-based, but Salton, Allan and Buckley  1993  have developed  a  passage  retrieval  system  based  on  retrieval  of  excerpts  of documents rather than the whole document. This is particularly relevant where a  search  yields  many  long  documents  which  users  then  have  to  navigate through to find the relevant material. This research has been carried forward by exploring different computational techniques to improve the performance of  passage  retrieval  systems   MacFarlane,  Robertson  and  McCann,  2004 . Passage retrieval can also be used to exploit the structure of XML documents to narrow down the search results in XML element retrieval  Winter, 2008 .  Information Theory Shannon’s Information Theory, based on his work at Bell Labs, underpins digital  communications  systems  today   Shannon,  1948 .  It  looks  at  the probability that a particular unit of communication  such as a word or phrase  will occur. The average quantity of information conveyed by a unit  expressed as entropy  reaches its maximum when the probabilities of word occurrence are all equal to one another. Otherwise, there is quite a lot of redundancy built into most text-based systems. The less frequently a unit of communication occurs, the more information it conveys. This can be used to compute the incremental value of a two-word term over its separate components. In other words, compound terms  or co-location of relevant words  can improve the ranking of a retrieved document. This approach leads to a mathematical analysis that is independent of linguistic analysis. The entropy, H, is equal to   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 98  98 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  minus the constant, k, times the sum of the probability of occurrence of a term, i, times the log of the probability of occurrence of the term, i., expressed as:  Shannon’s Information Theory provides a measure of information in terms of the probability of occurrence of a symbol  Shannon and Weaver, 1949 . The symbol might be a character, a keyword, or an indexing phrase. If the symbol is an indexing term, we get a measure of how valuable or useful a term might be for indexing purposes. Different techniques for term weighting have been developed  from  this  information  theory.  If  the  term  appears  in  every document in the collection it has no indexing value, because it does not allow users to select sub-sets of the collection or to discriminate between individual resources. If it appears in a few documents it could be useful, but it is difficult to determine how useful it might be or whether there is an ideal frequency of occurrence  Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 2011, 66–7 .  Types of information retrieval There has been a long history of information retrieval theory in the 20th century, which is reflected in the development of many specialist search engines and database systems. For very large document collections, ranking of search results is critical to the utility of the search system and this has shifted the emphasis of retrieval systems away from simple text retrieval towards statistical approaches. These models can be applied to different types of retrieval target  Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 2011, 59–61 :    Unstructured text  – Boolean  Fuzzy, Extended Boolean, Set-based  –                    Vector  Generalised vector, Latent semantic indexing, Neural   – Probabilistic  BM25, Language models, Divergence from randomness,   networks   Bayesian networks    Semi-structured text  – Proximal nodes – XML-based    Web-based – Page-rank – Hubs and authorities    Multimedia  – Image retrieval   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 99  RETRIEVING INFORMATION  PURPOSE 2   99  – Audio and music retrieval – Video retrieval  The primary concern here will be with retrieval of unstructured text, such as that  typically  found  in  books  and  journal  articles.  The  description ‘unstructured’ does not mean that there is no structure to the text, but rather that it does not conform to a standard structure  as defined in a document type description or XML scheme, for instance . The text in a book will usually be organised into a title page, contents section, chapters and sections and a bibliography and index at the end. However these may not be defined in a way that can be interpreted easily by a machine.   Semi-structured text such as that found in web resources is also of interest as a great deal of retrieval by online search engines is based on this type of resource. They exploit both embedded metadata as well as the text on the page.  HTML  markers  may  indicate  headings,  allowing  for  a  degree  of automation in the weighting of terms for retrieval. Titles and section headings would tend to have greater significance than body text on the page.  The retrieval approaches can be broadly categorised as follows:    Set Theory – such as Boolean logic and fuzzy searching   Algebraic retrieval – such as vector spaces for ranking and latent  semantic indexing    Probabilistic retrieval – such as Bayesian analysis  Boolean logic Set theory has developed considerably since George Boole, a 19th-century mathematician, invented Boolean algebra using logical operators to combine sets. These basic operators are available on many search interfaces and are a fundamental part of searching the internet and metadata collections such as library catalogues. The commonly used operators are:  AND – both search terms or expressions linked by the ‘AND’ operator must occur in the retrieved documents OR – either search term or expression linked by the ‘OR’ operator must occur in the retrieved documents NOT – the retrieved set excludes all documents containing the specified search term or expressions that follow the ‘NOT’ operator.  In Figure 6.2 on the next page a library catalogue contains details on books about pets. In the first example an enquirer wants books about both cats and dogs. The area of overlap between the two circles repre sents the set of books   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 100  100 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  on  Figure 6.2 Boolean operators  CAT AND DOG. Another reader might be less discriminating and may want anything on either cats or dogs. This is represented by the total area of both circles CAT OR DOG. In the third example, someone may be looking for books that are exclusively about cats and which do not mention dogs at all: CAT NOT DOG. This is represented by the left-hand circle, but excluding that part which overlaps with the circle for ‘DOG’. Although this type of search facility is available on many commonly used search engines, most users do not explicitly use Boolean operators. They tend to be limited to advanced searchers. Google and other search systems use the ‘AND’ operator implicitly to link two or more search terms that are entered without operators between them. If it recognises a phrase, it will be more specific than a single word. Other search engines, particularly those found in intranets and on websites, use the OR operator by default – expanding the search for each term that is entered into the query.  Fuzzy searching Rather than a binary condition where a document is either a member of a set or it is not, extended Boolean search models allow for weights to be attached to terms and for a degree of membership of a set to be processed. Different implementations  of  this  approach  have  showed  improved  retrieval performance  over  simple  Boolean  retrieval   Colvin  and  Kraft,  2016 .  So document retrieval may be defined by the intersection and the union between documents with respect to terms A and B:   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 101  RETRIEVING INFORMATION  PURPOSE 2   101  Vector spaces for ranking The move towards ranking of documents means that term frequency within a document is also important. These measures have been incorporated into a vector  model  that  forms  the  basis  of  many  subsequent  vector  retrieval algorithms  Salton and Yang, 1973 .  The frequency of occurrence of a term i in a document j is defined by the function fi,j. The total number of occurrences of the term i in a document collection of size N, is the sum of the occurrences in the individual documents that make up the collection. When dealing with large numbers, it is more convenient  to  use  logarithmic  values,  because  of  the  law  of  diminishing returns. If Document A has 100 occurrences of a term and Document B has 1000, it does not mean that Document B is ten times as relevant. Following this principle this equation can be modified as follows:  The Inverse Document Frequency  IDF  function, developed by Karen Sparck- Jones   1972   measures  the  exhaustivity   number  of  index  terms  in  a document  and the specificity  number of documents which contain a term . N is the total number of documents and ni is the number of documents that contain the term ki.  Salton and Yang  1973  combine Term Frequency  TF  and IDF weights to produce a vector value that is an indication of the usefulness of an indexing term for retrieving and ranking search results.  Latent semantic indexing An alternative approach is Latent Semantic Indexing, which is based on a statistical  analysis  of  the  co-occurrence  of  terms  in  a  retrieved  set  of documents in order to refine the search results and to deliver a more reliable ranking of search results. Commonly occurring words in a document are identified as keywords of that document. Vector analysis is used to calculate the similarity between documents and therefore cluster them for retrieval  Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto 2011, 101–2 .   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 102  102 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  Bayesian Inference and the Probabilistic Model Bayes Theorem shows the relationship between two independent events A and B. It states that the probability of A given that B is true can be calculated from the product of the probability of A times the probability of B given that A is true, divided by the probability of B:  The probabilistic model is an application of Bayesian Inference and provides the basis for weighting individual query terms and documents. Bayesian Inference is particularly useful because it provides a more accurate way of estimating the probability of an event  such as whether a document is relevant to a search query  where the probabilities are low. As the original paper says:  But what most of all recommends the solution in this Essay is, that it is compleat in those cases where information is most wanted, and where Mr. De Moivre’s solution of the inverse problem can give little of no direction; I mean, in all cases where either p or q are of no considerable magnitude. [. . .] And tho’ in such cases the Data are not sufficient to discover the exact probability of an event, yet it is very agreeable to be able to find the limits between which it is reasonable to think it must lie, and also to be able to determine the precise degree of assent which is due to any conclusions or assertions relating to them.   Bayes and Price, 1763   Term frequency across a document collection provides a statistical method for  ranking  documents.  IDF  and  document  length  are  also  used  in probabilistic models. Where feedback is built into the system  either explicitly where the searcher selects the most relevant items or implicitly by the system monitoring  use  of  retrieved  items  to  assess  relevance   the  results  can  be refined by a process of iteration.  Evaluating retrieval performance Precision and recall In text retrieval systems, retrieval effectiveness can be measured in terms of precision and recall  van Rijsbergen, 1979, 148–50 . These measures were developed in the Cranfield experiments and are still widely used, notably in the annual Text Retrieval Conference or TREC  National Institute of Standards and Technology, 2017 . In the context of the internet, these translate as two performance issues:   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 103  RETRIEVING INFORMATION  PURPOSE 2   103    Lack of precision – internet searches often result in the retrieval of too  much material, most of it irrelevant    Low recall – missing relevant material because the search is not  comprehensive enough or the resource is ‘hidden’.  Precision and recall Precision is the proportion of relevant material actually retrieved to the total number of documents retrieved.  Precision =   No. relevant documents retrieved    Total no. of documents retrieved   Recall is the proportion of relevant material actually retrieved in answer to a search request to the total number of relevant items.  Recall =   No. of relevant documents retrieved    Total no. of relevant documents   These two measures can be expressed in terms of the following contingency table where A is the total number of relevant documents in a set, and B is the total number of documents retrieved:  Retrieved Not retrieved  Relevant A∩ B  A∩ B  A  Non-relevant A∩ B  A∩ B  A  B B N  Precision =  Recall =  A∩B  A∩B  B  A  Precision  and  recall  are  widely  used  for  evaluating  the  effectiveness  of retrieval systems. As the precision increases, the recall often decreases. The reverse is often true as well. As the number of items retrieved increases, the precision  the proportion of relevant items in the retrieved set  decreases. In practice precision and recall are difficult to measure, especially in a dynamic and diverse environment such as the internet, because it is necessary to know the total population of relevant items on the system. It can also be difficult to assess the relevance of a retrieved item, especially if only one item is actually needed to address the information need. In a web environment that uses vector analysis and probabilistic searches to produce ranked results, it is impossible to review the set of all documents that match a particular enquiry in the Boolean sense. However the precision measure can be modified so that   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 104  104 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  a fixed number of ranked results is evaluated. For instance, if the first k items in a retrieved set is evaluated it is possible to produce a measure such as the precision at k. The first page of a search result may have ten items, and that typically is as far as most searchers look. So an evaluation of those first ten items makes sense to most users. This would be expressed as ‘precision at k where k=10’ or ‘the precision of the first ten results’.  Another aspect of retrieval performance is recall. It is not always possible to predict the effectiveness of a particular search query for retrieving relevant items.   If different terminology is used by the searcher and the creator of the text, there is likely to be a mismatch. For instance, a news report using the word ‘migrants’  may  be  about  asylum-seekers  or  refugees  as  well  as  so-called economic migrants. This might mean that a search on ‘refugees’ would miss this news report. Controlled vocabularies and browsing systems may go some way to addressing this issue, by associating related terms, or by providing a navigation  route  to  the  preferred  term.  The  role  of  thesauri  and  other controlled vocabulary systems is discussed in Chapter 12.  Retrieval on the internet Metadata can be used to put search terms into some kind of semantic context – in effect telling the search engine or other application how to deal with a particular metadata element. This is typically seen in a library catalogue, where it is possible to distinguish between the author ‘Green’,  i.e. the name of a person  and the keyword ‘green’, which describes a topic such as the colour green. This kind of semantic distinction is becoming available on the internet, using mark-ups of metadata  such as Dublin Core  embedded in web pages. Metadata embedded in social media postings, for instance, are widely used for selecting target audiences for e.g. online advertising. Algorithms analyse metadata about user behaviour such as sites visited and interactions with other users to group individuals into different categories for market segmentation. Users can tag their own postings and indeed it is possible for website owners to embed metadata in their pages. This is used on social media sites where users’ descriptions are used as one type of information retrieval. This is particularly notable in personal image collections such as Flickr, SmugMug or Google Photos. User labelling extends to titles, galleries, captions and tags  depending on which service is used . A collection of tags on a service is sometimes called a folksonomy and raises many issues of quality control and consistency. A more consistent approach would be to use words selected from a controlled vocabulary such as a classification scheme or thesaurus. This type of indexing can be facilitated by presenting the user   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 105  RETRIEVING INFORMATION  PURPOSE 2   105  with a drop-down menu to select from, or a series of drop-downs to navigate to the appropriate term.   Some web authors include the variant words or synonyms in the text of their documents. This provides an alternative to explicit metadata elements for subject content. However, this depends on the consistency with which authors apply synonyms to the document and how comprehensively they do it. A more consistent approach is to use controlled terms selected from a thesaurus  and  to  allow  the  search  engine  to  automatically  make  the connection  between  the  controlled  term  and  its  synonyms,  by  means  of synonym rings  see Chapter 12 .  Search engines and ranking Search engines are constantly evolving and their approach to retrieval on the internet has changed. The precise algorithms used by search engines tend not to be published, because of the potential this gives web creators to manipulate search outcomes. However, it is possible to see a pattern in the way in which they  have  developed  from  simple  pattern  matching  to  sophisticated algorithms that are based on probabilistic retrieval.  At the simplest level a search engine can simply look for all occurrences of a  word  or  a  phrase  in  its  database  of  internet  resources.  It  may  list  the retrieved items in the order in which it found the items. At a slightly more sophisticated level it could list retrieved items in date order or in reverse chronological order. This is manageable if a few items are retrieved, but not particularly helpful for internet searches which can result in thousands or even millions of hits. Given the general reluctance of users to deploy more than one search term or to refine search strategies, some kind of relevance ranking becomes essential.  Internet search engines started to develop ranking algorithms based on the number of occurrences of a search term in the web page retrieved. Although this can be helpful, it tends to favour longer documents where there is a greater  chance  of  the  search  term  occurring  multiple  times.  The  next refinement was to look at the frequency of occurrence of a search term. For instance, 5 occurrences of the search term in a document 500 words long  a frequency of 1 in 100  gives a higher frequency of occurrence than, say 10 occurrences of the same search term in a web resource which is 10,000 words long  a frequency of 1 in 1000 .  The big breakthrough was to realise that the position of a word, its context, will  have  a  bearing  on  its  relevance.  Users  of  library  catalogues  will  be familiar with the differences that occur when searching for a word in the title, or in the text of a summary or abstract. A similar principle can be applied to   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 106  106 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  websites. If the word is in the title of a web page, search engines now tend to attribute greater weight to it than if it only occurs in the main body of the page. Matches to the title words push the resource up the ranking of hits.  Metadata can now play a role in putting a term into context. Unfortunately this is a feature that was exploited unscrupulously by a minority of web authors who embedded repetitions of keywords in the metadata. This manipulation was carried to its logical conclusion by putting in the name of competitors in the  metadata  fields  of  their  home  pages.  This  meant  that  searches  for  a competitor’s name would retrieve the site indexed in this way - a good way of alerting competitors’ customers to the existence of your products or services. Because of the possibility of overt manipulation, most search engines reduced the weight attached to metadata terms or ignored them altogether.  Search engines have continued to evolve and enhance the quality and utility of search results by using semantic web features to make results more relevant. Fact retrieval systems such as Google’s Knowledge Graph also depends on semantic  metadata.  Ontologies,  such  as  DBpedia,  FOAF,  schema.org  and Facebook Open Graph are all used to add meaning to search results. Metadata is still important for retrieval, especially where users might want to restrict the results by format, date or other criteria. Apart from social media sites, some communities still add metadata to target pages to enhance retrieval. Domains such as government or academic institutions may be more controlled in the way in which they use subject terms to describe the content of their pages. For instance, institutional repositories make subject  and other  metadata visible by using Dublin core tags. This makes the resources discoverable by OAI-PMH harvesting systems, which can then compile their own indexes of material  see Chapter  4  for  OAI-PMH .  They  regularly  scan  the  target  repositories  for updates which can then be incorporated into their own indexes.  Subject indexing and retrieval The  concepts  of  subject  indexing  can  be  applied  to  internet  portals  and gateways and to intranets to enhance retrieval performance. Some of the data elements  used  for  resource  description,  such  as  ‘title’,  ‘description’  and ‘creator’, are also used for information retrieval. Retrieval performance can be improved by use of controlled terminology to describe the subject content of the resource. Classification of material according to a taxonomy can also provide a precise route in to relevant material.  Information retrieval in context Intranets can be more tightly controlled than a group of websites, or the   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 107  RETRIEVING INFORMATION  PURPOSE 2   107  internet. All too often intranets grow in an uncontrolled manner and do not have  a  coherent  structure.  It  is  common  for  each  department  within  an organisation to have considerable autonomy about what goes on the intranet and the result can be more like a scaled-down version of the internet than a structured  information  resource.  Content  management  systems  can  help organisations  to  manage  their  intranets  and  websites  more  effectively. However, even with use of the additional metadata elements to describe the content of a particular page or site, there may be an issue of consistency. Indexing resources is expensive in terms of human effort and lack of suitably skilled staff can be a limiting factor. This absence can affect the quality and consistency of indexing. Web managers need to be aware of these issues when they are implementing a metadata strategy.  Using data elements to refine search results Data elements provide a context for search results. One of the features of metadata  is  that  individual  fields  are  labelled.  This  allows  some  search engines and search interfaces to provide a ‘search by form’ or ‘query by example’ approach. In the example in Figure 6.3 on the next page, entering a term into the relevant fields makes it possible to retrieve relevant items. In this example, from the British Library’s advanced search menu, the term ‘bean’ gives very different results if the search is in the Author field or in the Main  Title  field.  In  each  case  the  search  is  restricted  to  the  appropriate metadata element or cataloguing data field. This kind of approach is seen in tightly managed systems where the contents of the information repository can be controlled and structured with embedded data elements or are linked to separate metadata records.  Metadata and computational models of retrieval Human intervention is not always necessary for indexing. Many communities of interest have explored methods of automatically indexing materials. In some areas automated systems work in conjunction with human-applied indexing held  as  metadata,  in  other  areas  it  is  seen  as  an  alternative.  Some  of  the automated systems work with the content of the resource  different forms of textual  analysis ,  others  with  associated  metadata   extracting  terms  from description metadata elements  and others focus on analysis of the queries to build up a user profile.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 108  108 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  Figure 6.3 British Library search interface  Image retrieval Multimedia files present challenges for retrieval because their content is not composed of text which can be indexed and retrieved. Ponceleón and Slaney  2011,  589   talk  about  the  ‘semantic  gap’ which  they  define as ‘the  gap between contents of a multimedia signal and its meaning.’ Retrieval by the characteristics  of  the  images  or  sounds  can  be  achieved  by  a  variety  of processing  techniques  and  advances  in  face  recognition  and  speech recognition allow for subject retrieval in some cases. Content-Based Image Retrieval  CBIR  has been focused on colour, texture and salient points of images  or  multimedia  files.  This  approach  represents  an  alternative  to metadata-based retrieval.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 109  RETRIEVING INFORMATION  PURPOSE 2   109  The semantic content of images poses a particular challenge, because of the need for human intervention, either at the point of creation of the multimedia file  for instance by adding descriptive metadata to the file  or at the point of ingestion of the multimedia file into a repository or database  for instance by indexing  or  classifying  images .  There  is  still  a  requirement  for  human intervention to analyse and describe the semantic content of multimedia materials. There is a long tradition of organising and indexing audiovisual material so that it can be retrieved by subject. Major broadcasters such as the BBC  have  established  archives  of  television  broadcasts  and  many  major newspapers use their own or buy services from commercial image collections. These  collections  are  normally  indexed  manually  by  a  variety  of  criteria according to the likely requirements of their principal users. The indexing may be very specific, such as ‘London Bridge’, or may be general – ‘bridges carrying road traffic’. They may be indexed according to the predominant colour – ‘red sunset’ – or by some generic abstract concept – ‘tranquillity’. Chapter 4 discussed metadata standards, including MPEG-7, which captures a variety of attributes about a multimedia object including subject. These approaches can be developed and enhanced by deploying analysis of the subject content in different ways.   MPEG-7 defines other attributes of images such as format of the image file, resolution of the image, the application that originated the item and the date of creation of the image, as well as the date of subsequent changes. These  are  all  criteria  that  can  be  used  to  select  or  to  narrow  down  the selection of images. In other contexts the same metadata elements are used to  manage  the  resources,  described  in  Chapter  7.  The  formal  metadata standards will determine which information may be available. Many image creation packages, such as digital cameras, attach their own metadata to the image. This may be destroyed if the image file is transferred and saved in another  application.  Other  metadata  associated  with  an  image  includes format, resolution, originating application, date of creation and subsequent changes.  The PhotoMetadata Project  Library of Congress and Stock Artists Alliance,  2009  identifies three broad categories of image metadata:  1 technical metadata, such as EXIF files, which are generated by the  2 descriptive metadata, such as the IPTC Core, which describes the  capture device  e.g. camera   semantic content of an image  3 administrative metadata, such as the PLUS system, which deals with  licensing and intellectual property rights associated with an image.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 110  110 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  The content-based image retrieval approach uses algorithms for automatic processing of images to yield measures that can be compared with an example image, or specified by a human operator  Hirata and Kato, 1992 . It is an alternative  to  concept-based  searching  that  uses  the  textual  content  of metadata associated with images. CBIR analyses images and matches the resulting profiles against a query image to provide similar images in response to a search. For instance, potential copyspace for use by advertisers can be identified using CBIR. For other applications, some text-based indexing may also be required – either by analysing the text surrounding the image, or by explicitly applying indexing terms.   However, metadata still has a role to play:  The most important factor affecting what can be done with multimedia assets  apart from their editorial value  is their intrinsic quality  e.g. the definition of an image or the encoding format of a video  and the quality of the metadata associated with them.  Metadata are textual descriptions that accompany a content element; they can  range in quantity and quality, from no description  e.g. Web cam content  to multilingual data  e.g. closed captions and production metadata of motion pictures . Metadata can be found: 1. embedded within content  e.g. closed captions ; 2. in surrounding Web pages or links  HTML content, link anchors, etc. ; 3. in domain-specific databases  e.g. IMDb1 for feature films ; 4. in ontologies  like those listed in the DAML Ontology Library2 .   Ceri et al., 2013, 209   Image  and  multimedia  websites  such  as  Flickr,  iStock,  Instagram  and YouTube use a variety of techniques for making their content available to users. These exploit embedded metadata in image files, for instance, as well as assigned indexing terms and user-generated tags. Figure 6.4  opposite  shows the metadata fields associated with an image in iStock, for instance  iStockphoto LP 2017 . This is reflected in the search parameters that are available  to  users.  The  primary  search  window  is  for  subject  searching  assigned categories plus tags assigned by the image owner . The selection can  then  be  refined  by  collection  name,  licence  type,  whether  the  image contains people or not, the image shape  landscape, portrait, square  the colour and the size of image. It is also possible to limit searches by format: photos; illustrations; video; and audio.  Latterly,  advances  in  machine  learning  mean  that  automated  image recognition is becoming much more sophisticated, with a range of techniques for automatic image descrip tion and retrieval  Bernardi et al., 2016 . Today there   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 111  RETRIEVING INFORMATION  PURPOSE 2   111  Figure 6.4  Metadata ﬁelds in iStockphoto   GettyImages, 2017   are widely available apps on smartphones and other devices that allow users to associate a face with a name. The system then automat ically labels similarly appearing faces in other photos, effectively recog nis ing individuals in photo albums. At the time of writing there were some experimental auto-captioning systems such as CaptionBot which processes uploaded images and creates a caption using artificial intelli gence techniques  Microsoft, 2017 . This approach could provide enhanced retrieval from a collection of images that have been processed in this way. Further work on deep indexing of images provides more complex descriptions  Karpathy and Fei-Fei, 2017 .   Conclusion Although  free-text  searching  and  Boolean  logic  are  powerful  tools  for retrieval, more sophisticated statistical methods are widely used for internet searching to provide a way of ranking search results. Shannon’s Information Theory and Bayesian Inference have both played an important role in the development of a new generation of search engines designed for handling large data sets. The effectiveness of a retrieval set can be measured in terms   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 112  112 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  of relevance and recall, one of the fundamental developments in information retrieval theory.  Metadata has a key role to play in high-quality information retrieval and is particularly important in clearly defined domains. It also plays a key role in providing users with options for searching on different attributes and for putting the search queries into context. Despite these sophisticated options, many users prefer to use a simple search window where a single term or expression  is  entered.  There  is  a  great  deal  of  potential  for  high-quality retrieval on the internet, but a lot of this will depend on educating users about the possibilities.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 113  CHAPTER 7 Managing information resources  Purpose 3   Overview Management of information was the third of the purposes of metadata identified in the six-point model of metadata use. This chapter describes the information lifecycle and a simplified model of this provides the framework for describing the management of information  resources  and  the  role  of  metadata.  The  chapter  considers  the  role  of metadata in each of the main stages of the information lifecycle. This is illustrated with examples from libraries, archives, records management and research data repositories.   Information lifecycles One  of  the  purposes  of  metadata  is  to  manage  the  capture,  storage, distribution and use of information resources. This can be done in a variety of contexts: libraries, records collections, archives, research data repositories and multimedia collections. As well as formal collections, metadata also plays an  important  role  in  the  organisation  of  personal  collections,  such  as bibliographic references, social media and personal files.  The concept of an information lifecycle is widely used in the management of digital resources and particularly for preservation. There are identifiable stages in the life of a digital resource and this provides a basis for managing those  resources.  Detlor   2010   puts  forward  a  process-based  view  of information  management  where  the  number  of  steps  in  the  information lifecycle  depends  on  the  perspective  taken   organisational,  library,  or personal . This is an idea that is also summarised in Floridi’s  2010  overview of  Information.  Although  metadata  does  not  refer  exclusively  to  digital   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 114  114 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  information  it is also used for books and other physical manifestations of information  the majority of examples discussed here are electronic. These include websites, electronic document and records management systems, data repositories and social media. The lifecycle concept is well developed in records management and this is reflected in ISO15489-1:2016, the international standard for records management, which emphasises events in the lifecycle of records:  Six broad classes of metadata may be used in the management of records. They may be applied to all entities  see above , or fewer, depending on the complexity of the implementation. The six classes are the following:  a  Identity – information to identify the entity; b  Description – information to determine the nature of the entity; c  Use – information that facilitates immediate and longer-term use of the entity; d  Event plan – information used to manage the entity, such as disposition   e  Event history – information recording past events on both the entity and its   f  Relation – information describing the relationship between the entity and other  information;  metadata;  entities.   ISO, 2016a   Strictly speaking, record keeping could be described as a workflow, but it has many  features  in  common  with  the  digital  curation  lifecycle.  One  of  the principles of records management is that: ‘records consist of content and metadata, which describes the context, content and structure of the records, as  well  as  their  management  through  time’  ISO,  2016a . The  standard identifies the following stages in a record’s life:    creating records   capturing records   records classification and indexing   access control   storing records   use and re-use   migrating and converting records   disposition.  A  record  comes  into  being  when  a  document  is  created  or  received  and attached to a registered file or given a file heading. During the capture process   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 115  MANAGING INFORMATION RESOURCES  PURPOSE 3   115  metadata  is  created  for  the  record  and  would  typically  include  date  of creation, the owner and business classification. Metadata can be applied to paper files or electronic records. Once created, a record may be retrieved and used but not changed; this is known as fixity. It is classified and indexed to ensure that it can be retrieved and that it is handled as part of the appropriate class of records. During its life, access controls may be applied to a record so that only authorised people are able to retrieve and use it. Preservation and storage  are  important  considerations,  especially  in  a  changing  digital environment. Disposal according to a retention schedule may be triggered by an event, such as date of creation. The record may also be converted and migrated to a new environment and this would be recorded in the record’s metadata. ISO 15489-1:2016 specifies that metadata for records should include the following:  a  a description of the content of the record b  the structure of the record . . . c  the business context. . . d  relationships with other records and other metadata e  identifiers and other information needed to retrieve and present the record . . . f  the business actions and events involving the record throughout its existence . .  ISO, 2016a   Metadata standards such as ISAD G  and EAD describe some of the data elements that are used to manage records  ICA 2000; Library of Congress, 2016a . ISO23081-2:2009 provides a detailed metadata standard developed for records management  ISO, 2009d .   The lifecycle model can be developed for digital curation of research data such as that generated by research groups and typically held by universities. Description and storage of research data sets has become an important way of making research data available for further analysis. They may also be consolidated into larger data sets. A simplified version of the Digital Curation Centre’s  2010  lifecycle model is illustrated in Figure 7.1 overleaf.  Some of the attributes of this model can be simplified further to give us the following defined stages in the life of an information resource or digital object in a managed environment  see Figure 7.2, page 116 :    Create and ingest information – This is the original creation or compilation of the information, its capture onto a system and attachment of metadata such as index terms to that information source.    Distribute and use – During this phase of the lifecycle the information is  accessed and utilised by a variety of consumers or designated   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 116  116 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  Concept-  ualise  Create or receive  Transform  Appraise and select  Dispose  Accesss and use  Ingest  Store  Preserve  Figure 7.1 DCC simpliﬁed information lifecycle  Create or  ingest  Transform  Preserve and store  Dispose  Review  Distribute and use  Figure 7.2 Generic model of information lifecycle  communities of users. These may be specialist users, in which case the management of their use may extend to issues of authentication and rights management, or they may be general users, where the potential uses may be difficult to predict.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 117  MANAGING INFORMATION RESOURCES  PURPOSE 3   117    Review – An information source may be superseded or become  redundant. The review process is intended to ensure that the overall information system continues to be up to date, relevant and accurate.   Preserve and store – The integrity of the information sources needs to be maintained with proper back-up procedures and migration policies as the technology changes and develops.    Dispose – Following the review process the information resource may be  destroyed, archived for future reference, or transferred to long-term storage, where cheap storage and maintenance is offset against lower accessibility.    Transform – The record content may lead to creation of a new document,  which may be ingested into the system, and so the cycle begins again.  The remainder of this chapter will consider the role of metadata in each of these  stages  in  the  lifecycle  of  an  information  resource,  illustrated  with examples  from  librarianship,  records  management,  digital  curation  and content management.  Create or ingest Different levels of aggregation will affect the ingestion of documents. For instance, in records management systems, most of the metadata associated with a record or file is generated at the point of creation or capture onto the records  management  system.  The  metadata  elements  can  be  applied  at different  levels  of  aggregation:  an  individual  record   which  may  be  an electronic  document  or  spreadsheet,  for  level  corresponding to a paper file ; or at class level  a file plan category . The items at a lower level of aggregation inherit the attributes of their category, so that for instance a document will inherit the metadata elements that apply to the folder to which it belongs.  instance ;  at  folder   Institutional  repositories  often  depend  on  data  entry  by  the  authors themselves. This means that quality control issues may be a concern. Use of drop-down  lists  can  help  to  address  some  of  these  concerns,  along  with intervention by cataloguers after the data has been entered.  Libraries  have  slightly  different  processes  at  the  point  of  acquisition. Notably, retrieval systems predominate and selection, ordering and purchase of resources are significant factors. Co-operation between the book trade  publishers, suppliers, retailers  and the library and information community has opened up a number of possibilities. The acquisitions process can be handled electronically – ranging from the small-scale ordering of individual items via internet suppliers, or direct from publisher, through to purchase via   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 118  118 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  large-scale book suppliers, who may also select materials on behalf of the library. Basic cataloguing data can be used to identify relevant items  e.g. author, title information . If already known, identifiers such as ISBNs can also be used for selecting titles. Publisher-supplied metadata can be made available as part of the ONIX data, or MARC records can be located from central catalog - uing agencies such as OCLC, the Library of Congress or the British Library. The ONIX records allow for tracking of order information and verification of delivery. ONIX is intended to support a fully-integrated e-commerce approach to acquisition. This will include the delivery and payment details as well as price and any discounts that may apply. Once the item has been acquired, further  cataloguing  may  be  necessary  to  make  it  retrievable.  Library management systems usually import and export data in MARC 21 format, although  this  may  change  with  the  introduction  of  BIBFRAME.  Imported records are enhanced with additional proprietary metadata from the library management system and local data added by the cataloguers. The internal metadata may include location information, loan records, details about the management of binding of journals and covering of books and withdrawal and disposal of items.  Preserve and store The curation of information resources includes the storage and preservation of items. In libraries, this is focused on the physical state of items. Digital items such  as  electronic  records  and  e-journals  present  additional  challenges  of integrity, readability and obsolescence of technology and data storage formats. The DCC Model allows for migration as a preservation action, leading to the transformation of the resource and starting the lifecycle again  Digital Curation Centre, 2010 . This information is captured in PREMIS metadata, discussed below.  One of the most useful reviews of metadata and preservation management summarises  four  different  strategies  available  for  preservation  of  digital resources  Day, 2004 :   1 Preserving the technology – Preserving and maintaining obsolete hardware  and operating systems so that the original data media can be read on them.  2 Emulation – Development of programs that mimic the obsolete systems –  so that the experience of using the data is as close to the original experience but using up-to-date technical platforms.  3 Migration – Transfer of data to an up-to-date system – currently the  strategy adopted by many archiving bodies.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 119  MANAGING INFORMATION RESOURCES  PURPOSE 3   119  4 Encapsulation – Enclosing the original data with descriptive metadata  that allows it to be deciphered and viewed.  Surrogacy and conservation are two possible approaches to the preservation of physical materials such as paper archives and printed books. Surrogacy is important for physical resources such as incunabula  printed books from before 1500  and illuminated manuscripts, which are fragile or which might be damaged by further handling. Digitisation of the contents of a book or archive, or the image of a museum object, has been widely used by libraries, archives, museums and galleries worldwide. Commercial picture agencies have also used this technology extensively. The focus is on images that can be viewed and retrieved but not manipulated – in the case of documents, the text is not encoded. With printed works, the text is often captured using Optical Character Recognition  OCR .  BBC Domesday Book project A digitised image or set of images will need to be managed in the same way as encoded text and issues such as durability of the medium, the readability of the file and the integrity of the image have to be managed if they are to be accessible to future audiences. This has already become a problem for early digital projects such as the BBC Domesday Book project, which was launched in 1986 to coincide with the 900th anniversary of the production of the original Domesday  Book   BBC,  2017 .  The  BBC  project  used  what  was  the  latest technology of the day, a Phillips Laserdisc, to hold a combination of digitised images  and  original  digital  content  in  the  form  of  text,  sound,  stills  and moving images. The technology used then was specifically customised for the project but is now obsolete.   One response to this challenge is to preserve the technology so that the original media can be viewed in its original context. Preserving the original technology is expensive and requires operational original equipment and spare  parts.  It  also  requires  the  software  to  be  maintained  as  closely  as possible  to  the  original  state.  This  approach  does  not  guarantee  that  the storage medium itself will maintain its integrity – so spare copies of the storage medium  in the example described this would be the laserdiscs  and the  ability  to  write  to  them  and  read  them   preservation  of  yet  more equipment  is required. The advantage of this ‘industrial archaeology’ is that future users would be able to experience the digital images in a similar way to the original audiences.  The alternative strategy is to migrate the file to a currently supported format. In the case of the BBC Domesday project the content has been transferred to   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 120  120 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  DVD technology, making it available to a new generation of users. Metadata on the migrated medium will help to ensure that the appropriate decisions are made when it comes to the next migration. It can also be used to capture data about the original format of the material prior to migration.  OAIS for preservation The  Open Archival  Information  System   OAIS ,  discussed  in  Chapter  3, provides a functional model and information model for digital preservation and  is  one  way  of  handling  preservation  metadata   CCSDS,  2012 .  The Archival  Information  Package  defined  in  the  OAIS  information  model includes Preservation Description Information comprised of the following types of information:    reference   provenance   context   fixity   access rights.  It also provides a channel of communication between different communities that are concerned with preservation issues, such as research data managers, archivists, publishers and the library community.  PREMIS for preservation The PREMIS metadata standard has been designed specifically to handle preservation issues. It deals with core metadata that is likely to be used by most  repositories  and  can  be  extended  to  include  data  elements  from specialist schemes that deal, for instance, with rights and technical metadata that ‘describes the physical rather than intellectual characteristics of digital objects’  PREMIS Editorial Committee 2015, 32 . The PREMIS data model establishes a relationship between Objects  information in digital form  and the Rights  or permissions  associated with them and the Activities that have an  impact  on  them.  Agents   people,  organisations  or  software   may  be associated with Rights or Events but do not have a direct effect on Objects  Figure 7.3 opposite .  1.1 objectIdentifier  1.2 objectCategory  1.3 preservationLevel    Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 121  MANAGING INFORMATION RESOURCES  PURPOSE 3   121  Object  Discrete unit of information subject to digital preservation.

He makes the point that research data managers can learn a great deal from the archives community,  which  has  pioneered  the  development  of  record-keeping metadata standards for the management and preservation of digital objects.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 122  122 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  Distribute and use Software applications that manage information resources often use their own proprietary metadata to enable the distribution and use of those resources. Information resources include records, archives, library materials, research data collections and web resources. The applications may also keep a record of any transactions that take place – another type of metadata associated with an information resource. This can be used to create an audit trail, which is a useful element of information governance.   The loan of physical materials and access to digital resources generates metadata about the resource and about the user and how the two interact. The loan item metadata is normally derived from the cataloguing information and  will  include  data  to  uniquely  identify  each  item  in  the  collection, equivalent to the item level in RDA  see Chapter 4 .  Borrower  details  may  include  data  about  the  number  of  other  items currently  on  loan.  This  is  particularly  true  of  academic  libraries,  where different categories of user may have different borrowing privileges. Some systems may keep a record of the loan history of patrons, although retention of this data is controversial in light of anti-terrorism legislation such as the Patriot Act 2001 in the USA, which allows the authorities to scrutinise loan details of suspected terrorists. However, anyone can be a suspect.  Data protection legislation in Europe means that libraries are not permitted to keep operational and transactional information relating to an individual any longer than is required for its original purpose  European Parliament and European Council, 2016 . In this case the purpose would be managing loans and  return  of  items.  Anonymised  and  aggregated  loan  data  is  used  by managers to assess the popularity of individual items and categories and to inform decisions on future selection. The source of data about the borrower usually needs to be verified, often by providing some kind of identification and independent confirmation of address. Authentication is an important part of managing metadata and is more fully discussed in Chapter 9.  For loan collections the location of a book is dependent on loan status and is  normally  flagged  up  when  the  system  is  interrogated.  This  type  of information is made available to library users via the OPAC  online public access catalogue  – sometimes with an indication of the likely wait time. The screenshot in Figure 7.4 shows an example of a public library loan record with the relevant metadata displayed, including due date, bibliographic details of the item, the identifier  in this case a bar code number  and the status action date. Borrower details are displayed on a separate page.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 123  MANAGING INFORMATION RESOURCES  PURPOSE 3   123  Figure 7.4  Loan record from Westminster Public Libraries   2017, Westminster City Council  Libraries and Sirsi Corporation  Review and dispose Most collection managers are faced with review and disposal of less used or out-of-date material. Metadata can be used to flag up items for review after a set time. Enterprise search systems may allocate review dates at the point of creation.   In records management systems retention periods are decided at the point of creation of a record and may be associated with a business classification system category or file plan category. Metadata can be associated with any level of the file plan and lower levels inherit the attributes of the higher level. For instance, if it is decided that all records relating to corporate policy- making should be kept indefinitely, all the subsidiary records under that heading would inherit this attribute. This makes management of records much easier, because a decision is taken for a category of records rather than on a record by record basis. There is still latitude to make exceptions where necessary: so it may be that some of the corporate policy-making records are ephemeral and need not be kept indefinitely, and they could have a much shorter retention period.  Disposal decisions may apply to an individual record or a class of records. Metadata associated with the folder to which the record belongs  or higher aggregation such as a file category from the file plan  is also associated with the record as it is captured or declared. This means that the disposal metadata   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 124  124 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  associated with the file category applies to the individual record as a default. Depending on the standard, the disposal data element can be divided into sub-elements to allow for effective management of the process. This will include ‘Disposal action’, ‘Disposal time period’, ‘Disposal due date’ and ‘Disposal authorised by’. In this way the metadata can effectively trigger a cascade of events during the record lifecycle.  Disposal  is  a  necessary  and  often  controversial  aspect  of  library management. Most library collections are living collections that are managed with  limited  space  available.  Library  managers  have  to  decide  how  to maintain their collections in a way that reflects the current needs of its users. This means weeding out-of-date and damaged materials as well as acquiring new titles. Metadata can be used to implement a retention disposal policy. Borrowing and usage patterns captured by the library management system can  reveal  which  items  are  not  being  used  and  which  therefore  may  be considered for disposal. Metadata associated with disposal will be of two types – intention and action. Intention applies to documents that have a known life or those that have been selected for disposal. Library management systems can be configured to generate disposal lists  in much the same way we have seen for records management , which can be reviewed before a final decision is made. Once an action has been taken and recorded, the metadata can provide an audit trail.  Transform The transform step completes the information lifecycle, by leading to the creation of new information resources. In creating a new document a new set of metadata is required for each unique document. This may be embedded within the document initially. New metadata is created when the document is captured to the appropriate repository, whether it is a library management system using MARC  or BIBFRAME  records, a records management system using ISAD G , or an enterprise search system based on Dublin Core with added metadata elements. Research data is designed to be made available for research and re-use. New data generated by manipulating or combining the research data with other data sources leads to the creation of new resources with their own metadata. Exposing metadata of existing resources through exchange formats such as OAI-PMH, or by making it available in RDF format, allows for the discovery, distribution and re-use. When combined with other data sources a data set is transformed into something new.    Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 125  MANAGING INFORMATION RESOURCES  PURPOSE 3   125  Conclusion Metadata is a tool for management of information resources, whether they are electronic and available on the internet, via a closed system, or physical and accessible via a library catalogue. Metadata enables lifecycle management where resources are created, modified, used and disposed of. The metadata is  utilised  by  software  applications  to  handle  transactions.  They  also document  processes  that  have  taken  place  during  the  lifecycle  of  an information resource.  For example, records management systems depend on metadata to trigger events in the lifecycle of a record. The metadata can also be used to anticipate the fate of an individual record as soon as it is created, rather than after many years when it is due for review and when the originators may have moved on or retired. Another example of the use of metadata can be seen in content management systems, which have their own metadata for describing and manipulating web or intranet content.   Preservation is a complex area with a range of issues to be addressed, including  digital  degradation  and  technology  obsolescence.  The  use  of metadata becomes particularly important for digital materials because it provides an avenue for describing the format and technology of a resource, aiding its management and recovery. Metadata standards such as OAIS and PREMIS are designed to facilitate preservation management.   Library  management  systems  use  acquisitions  data  to  manage  the workflow  from  ordering  and  payment  for  a  publication  through  to cataloguing and making it available to users. Metadata associated with loans keep track of individual items and assist with stocktaking exercises. Research data collections also benefit from controlled metadata use to describe and make available data collections for further research work, or for combination with other resources as linked data. These examples demonstrate the wide use of metadata for managing information resources. This is often based on the management of a resource’s lifecycle.

It  goes  on  to  describe  the  issues  arising  from authenticity, ownership, and rights management. A discussion of different models of intellectual property  IP  rights considers the Open Digital Rights Language as an example of an information modelling language that deals with intellectual property rights. The indecs system and PREMIS are referred to, because they both deal with rights, although they are discussed in more detail elsewhere. There is also a brief discussion of the way rights are handled by Dublin Core, MPEG-21 and the METS Rights extension to METS. The chapter goes on to consider provenance, starting with a general definition and then describing the PROV metadata standard. It then considers provenance in the context of records management, e-documents, books and printed materials.  Rights management Protection of intellectual property rights has a major economic impact on many  industries.  One  of  the  drivers  for  the  development  of  metadata standards in the publishing and book industry has been the need to manage copyright effectively. They form a key part of the framework for publishing, while  protecting  the  rights  of  those  involved  in  creating,  performing  or distributing a creative work. In most countries an author has moral rights to be identified as the creator of a work and consequently to enjoy the benefits that come with these rights. The World Intellectual Property Organization  WIPO   in  Geneva  regulates  international  treaties  to  help  facilitate   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 128  128 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  international exchange and trade in intellectual property  WIPO, 2015 . The interests of different parties involved in intellectual property protection are sometimes in conflict and use of the appropriate metadata helps to identify those interests. Metadata provides a way of mapping the interactions between the  stakeholders  and  provides  a  mechanism  for  addressing  rights  and ownership issues. The ease of copying and faithfulness of reproduction of digital  resources  both  pose  an  enormous  challenge  to  publishers,  record producers  and  film  makers.  The  growth  of  peer-to-peer  servers  for  file- sharing services continues to be a threat to copyright holders, because of the way they bypass royalty payments. Wholesale breaches of copyright also take place with electronic publications, software and other digital resources. The challenges are two-fold. The first challenge is establishing ownership of the rights,  be  they  publishing  rights,  recognition  of  authorship  or  rights  for exploitation of the resource in new ways  such as a translation or publication in a different format . The second challenge is ensuring that those rights are applied and that conditions of use are not breached – or that if they are, that the breaches can be detected.  Rights management metadata Whalen  2016  identifies five groups of metadata elements that are to do with intellectual property rights:  1 the name of the creator 2 the year the work was created 3 copyright status 4 publication status 5 date that rights research was conducted.  She goes on to tabulate some of the core elements for rights and this provides a  useful  basis  for  identifying  rights  data  in  general  catalogues  or  data collections. Data elements dealing with rights are built into general metadata standards such as Dublin Core or as extensions such as METSrights. For instance, in Dublin Core the dc.rights data element provides a home for data on copyright, licensing arrangements  such as those associated with Creative Commons licences  and access rights  such as those invoked by freedom of information legislation in different parts of the world . Dublin Core does not specify how this data element should be expressed. Commonly the data element is used to include a copyright statement to indicate ownership of rights.  Although  the  rights  data  element  does  not  have  any  formal refinements, individual authorities and organisations using Dublin Core have   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 129  MANAGING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS  PURPOSE 4   129  introduced  their  own  refinements,  such  as  Copyright,  which  would  be expressed  as:  dc:rights.Copyright.  Another  example  of  a  refinement  is dc:rights.AccessRights  to  indicate  intended  audience  and  the  conditions under which they may access a resource.  PREMIS and intellectual property rights Specialist  metadata  standards  such  as  PREMIS   described  in  Chapter  7  include optional rights data which can be linked to an information resource or to an agent. For instance, what access rights or reproduction rights does a repository have over a digital object in its collection? The rights statement and links between the rights data and an object and or agent help to define the permissions  associated  with  an  information  resource   PREMIS  Editorial Committee, 2015, 181 :  4.1 Rights statement 4.1.1 rightsStatementIdentifier 4.1.2 rightsBasis 4.1.3 copyrightInformation 4.1.4 licenseInformation 4.1.5 statuteInformation 4.1.6 otherRightsInformation 4.1.7 rightsGranted 4.1.8 linkingObjectIdentifier 4.1.9 linkingAgentIdentifier  METSRights METSRights is an external schema which is endorsed for use with METS  Library of Congress, 2016b . The schema deals with intellectual property rights associated with digital objects. It is an extension to METS and has the data elements RightsDeclaration, RightsHolder, and Context. This allows encoding of data about the nature of the rights associated with a digital object as well as who owns the rights or has access for use of the digital object. The Context provides a container for data about the circumstances in which the rights apply and any constraints on those rights.  Open Digital Rights Language  ODRL  Several  models  have  been  developed  to  help  conceptualise  intellectual property  rights  and  to  provide  a  basis  for  the  development  of  metadata   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 130  130 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  standards.  These  include  indecs  and  the  Open  Digital  Rights  Language  ODRL   and  have  led  to  the  development  of  industry-specific  metadata standards  such  as  ONIX   publishing  industry ,  OAI-rights  activity  government, museums and libraries , and MPEG-21  audiovisual materials . Modelling systems and languages such as ODRL can be used to mark up or express rights metadata.  The Open Digital Rights Language  ODRL  is described as ‘a standard language and vocabulary for the expression of terms and conditions over assets’  Iannella, 2002 . Terms and conditions include permission, constraints, requirements, conditions, offers, and agreement with rights holders. ODRL covers both physical manifestations and digital materials. It is an international initiative to develop an open standard for digital rights management and is designed to be compatible with a number of other models and standards for rights management metadata, including indecs, EBX, DOI, ONIX, MPEG, PRISM and Dublin Core. It provides cross-sectoral interoperability and is extensible. In the ODRL language there are three core entities:  1 Assets, which are equivalent to resources, objects or intellectual property  and cover physical objects as well as digital content.  2 Rights cover the terms and conditions for use of the assets and will  include permissions, constraints, requirements for use and conditions.  3 Parties are equivalent to users or people and cover all types of roles from  end-user to rights holders and creators. The term ‘Parties’ applies to organisations as well as individuals.  ODRL is a model that describes agreements between parties for rights over assets and their use. The language can be used to model different types of relationship and to allow for a range of interactions. The ODRL Foundation Model is illustrated in Figure 8.1  Iannella, 2002 .  Permissions cover four areas of activity: usage, re-usage, transfer and asset management. Within each area a number of specific activities are described:    Usage includes permission to display or print a resource  such as text ,  play a video or music or to execute a program.    Re-usage covers permission to modify content, excerpt material, annotate  items and aggregate the resource with other resources.    Transfer covers permissions to sell, lend, give or lease items. These are  commercial in focus and would cover the permission of libraries to lend books, for instance.    Asset management covers in-house management of the resource so that it   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 131  MANAGING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS  PURPOSE 4   131  Figure 8.1  ODRL Foundation Model   2002 World Wide Web Consortium  MIT, ERCIM,  Keio, Beihang   can be installed, backed up, moved, deleted and restored. These are non- trading activities, but are necessary for effective maintenance of the resource within a client organisation.   ONIX The book trade provides a good example of the complexities that arise when it comes to managing intellectual property rights. Rights-related metadata includes information on: authorship, publishers and territorial rights. The ONIX  metadata  framework  was  developed  with  this  partly  in  mind  EDItEUR, 2014 . In order to develop ONIX a framework was needed to analyse the different types of relationship that occur and are necessary for commercial  transactions  to  take  place.  The  indecs  model  is  just  such  a framework, developed with support from the European Commission with a focus specifically on rights management  Rust and Bide, 2000 .   By establishing rights ONIX allows for automated rights management and for the use of rights while protecting rights owners and allowing freedom of legitimate, fair use. There are different views of metadata, including the intellectual property view  Figure 8.2 :   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 132  132 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  persons  intellectual property  make  used by  rights  own  in  Figure 8.2 Legal view of entities in ONIX    persons make intellectual property   intellectual property is used by persons   persons own rights in intellectual property.  An entity, such as a person, may have different attributes depending on the view used. In this chapter we have looked at only one view of the relationship between persons, intellectual property and rights. Each of these entities has an  identity  and  a  function.  In  the  indecs  model,  intellectual  property  is recognised as a legal concept defined by national legislation and international agreements and treaties. Indeed, different types of intellectual property are defined by treaties such as the WIPO Copyright Treaty  WIPO, 2017  and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty  WIPO, 2017 . Indecs actually uses metadata to describe ownership of rights etc. and it provides a data modelling language from which application profiles such as ONIX can be developed. A more detailed description of indecs can be found in Chapter 3.  MPEG-21 The MPEG-21 series of standards provides an interoperable framework for multimedia. The aim is to work across a range of communities and to facilitate integration  of  different  models.  MPEG-21  encompasses  content  creation, production, delivery and consumption  ISO, 2004b . It defines a framework for Intellectual Property Management and Protection  IPMP . The purpose is to enable legitimate users to identify and interpret intellectual property rights, whilst  enabling  rights  holders  to  protect  their  rights.  The  Digital  Items Declaration  Language   MPEG-21  DIDL   is  an  interoperable  schema  for   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 133  MANAGING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS  PURPOSE 4   133  declaring digital items. The language can be used to represent the Digital Item Declaration model and is one element of MPEG-21.   Rights management as an enabler Although there are systems focused on rights management itself, it is mostly seen  as  an  enabler  that  allows  trade  to  take  place.  By  establishing  the ownership rights for intellectual property, and in particular digital objects, the rights of creators and producers can be protected and this gives them an incentive to produce and release new products onto the market. For instance, the Creative Commons  2016  makes use of embedded metadata to facilitate the use of copyright material without the intervention of intermediaries  see Figure 8.3 . This means that an author or creator of material can make it available on the internet with standard licensing conditions. The metadata is generated from a website app and includes details of the licence type and can be embedded in a web page:  Figure 8.3 Creative Commons Licence, licensed under CC BY 4.0  <a  rel=‘license’  href=‘http:  creativecommons.org  licenses by 4.0 ’><img  alt=‘Creative  Commons  Licence’ style=‘border-width:0’ src=‘https:  i.creativecommons.org l by 4.0 88x31.png’  >  This  work  is  licensed  under  a  <a  rel=‘license’ href=‘http:  creativecommons.org licenses by 4.0 ’>Creative Commons  Attribution  4.0  International  License .  Additional metadata can be added to the embedded metadata, such as the author, title of the work, attributions and other permissions, as well as the format of the work. The XML RDFa code generated by the Creative Commons   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 134  134 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  website can be embedded in the web resource or other digital material. The title and source metadata are marked up as Dublin Core terms.  Provenance  Provenance – the place of origin or earliest known history of something.   Pearsall, 1999   When it comes to establishing the authenticity of an item, its history becomes important, its provenance: the circumstances of its creation, who owned it, and the conditions under which its ownership was transferred.   Records  management  and  good  governance  depend  on  being  able  to demonstrate the authenticity of a record and to provide documentation about its history and the way it has been managed. This may include details of transactions that have taken place: who viewed a particular document and when; what changes were made to the document during its history; and the measures adopted to ensure that unauthorised changes have not taken place. This provides the basis for legislation on the legal admissibility of electronic documents and whether they can be used as evidence in legal proceedings.  Provenance is something that has dominated trade in the art world. The idea that a painting is what it purports to be  for instance knowing who it was painted by, when, that it is not a forgery or copy  will affect its perceived value. This idea also applies to printed books and other physical artefacts, where there may be a value associated with an original manuscript or a first edition. This idea has been adopted in the commercial world and applies to documentation associated  with  business  transactions.  In  the  context  of  digital  materials, providing provenance information can help to demonstrate that a record has not been tampered with and that the evidence that it presents is therefore reliable. Moreau  2010  surveys the literature of provenance on the web and concludes that the benefits of publishing provenance data outweighs the costs.  Metadata  can  provide  a  record  of  the  provenance  of  a  document  and evidence that it has been kept to set standards and following defined proced - ures. This is vital for documents that have been scanned and digitised and where the original has been destroyed, as well as born-digital documents. Many banks and building societies routinely scan and digitise financial documents. The metadata associated with the digitised image helps to ensure that the resulting image is legally admissible in court. Traditionally, the authenticity of documents with legal weight such as contracts and wills was established by the signature and an identifying mark such as a seal or watermark. They also had metadata associated with them, such as details of how the document had   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 135  MANAGING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS  PURPOSE 4   135  been  kept  and  information  about  the  procedures  in  place  to  prevent tampering or indeed changes of any kind to the original.  In a document produced using an application such as Microsoft Word, for instance, the system updates details of the editing process and can keep track of version numbers, providing an audit trail. Identity numbers associated with electronic documents, digital images and other electronic resources such as DOIs  Digital Object Identifiers  are an essential part of any system that purports to preserve authenticity.  PROV  is  a  standard  for  provenance  metadata,  which  is  hospitable  to provenance metadata from other schemas. It is based on a model of Agent, Entity and Activity, shown in Figure 8.4  W3C, 2013 .  Figure 8.4  PROV metadata model for provenance   2013 World Wide Web Consortium,   MIT, ERCIM, Keio, Beihang   There are different approaches to recording the provenance of an item, depending on the type of item being described:    records and archives   digital images   electronic documents   books and printed material   metadata.  Records and archives In records management, knowing who has had responsibility for a document   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 136  136 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA   especially an electronic document  is a part of the control of its integrity. Being able to develop an audit trail is a key aspect of good governance. The concept of respect des fonds, the idea of grouping archives according to the way they were created or respect for the origin of the archive, is a part of archival theory which can be used to explore the issue of provenance. Being able to trace records, or scientific data  from a data archive  back to its original source is facilitated by metadata.  Digital objects Legal  admissibility  of  digital  objects  such  as  born-digital  documents  and digitised  images  depends  on  the  accompanying  documentation  and certification attesting to its authenticity. Metadata provides a way of recording details of the circumstances of creation of a document  date of creation, author, editor, etc.  and actions that have taken place since – an audit trail of who has accessed the document and any changes that have taken place – what the amendments were and who made them, when. As discussed in Chapter 2, many programs automatically attach their own metadata to electronic docu - ments  when  they  are  created  and  this  can  provide  an  audit  trail  for  the document as it is drafted and altered.  There  is  no  way  to  verify  the  authenticity  of  a  document  without information about its history and what has happened to it since its creation. For  this,  metadata  is  necessary.  The  authenticity  of  information  can  be determined by means of physical certificates to indicate that the document has been checked or that a specific procedure has been followed, or via the metadata embedded in the resource or held separately in a database.  Books and printed material Bibliographic records can incorporate details of ownership and past history of  printed  documents,  whether  they  be  archives,  or  formally  published material.  Some  standards  allow  for  user-defined  fields  for  details  of ownership and circumstances of change of ownership – for example, sale of an item. This type of information applies at item level  in FRBR terms  and tends to be used only for special items such as first editions of famous works, older material and items that are important because of who owned them – for instance, books with dedications or inscriptions by famous people inside them. Older materials such as incunabula  pre-1500 printed materials  and illuminated manuscripts need details of their provenance to help verify their authenticity. If it is not possible to account for its complete history, fraud becomes a real possibility. This is an issue that museums and art galleries face   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 137  MANAGING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS  PURPOSE 4   137  with individual paintings and objects in their collections. Good metadata used in conjunction with other tools and scholarship to establish the age and origin of an item help to build the case for the authenticity of an item.  Metadata Provenance  is  a  key  aspect  of  the  preservation  data  associated  with  an information  resource.  Metadata  and  metadata  schema  can  be  treated  as information  objects  or  digital  objects  for  the  purposes  of  describing provenance and managing their preservation. This allows the application of preservation  models  such  as  PROV  and  PREMIS  to  metadata   Li  and Sugimoto,  2014 .  This  approach  would  help  to  record  data  such  as  who created the metadata record, what content rules were used to create it, and when was it created or amended.   Conclusion In looking at rights management we see some similarities between different models of intellectual property rights. It quickly becomes clear that there are three  main  concepts  that  need  to  be  represented  in  any  model  of  rights management:  1 The item, content or resource – the intellectual property. 2 Agent, party, person, or organisation – this entity can play a number of  roles from intellectual property owner to consumer and any of the intermediaries.  3 Rights – including the terms and conditions of use as well as details of  ownership and other relationships between the item and the agent.  The models are capable of a great deal of complexity as we have seen above, but  the  use  of  comparable  building  blocks  allows  for  a  degree  of  inter - operability between different schemas arising from the models.  Rights management metadata was developed in response to the need to protect the intellectual property rights associated with digital resources and a need to allow for the different types of transaction that take place in creating and  distributing  electronic  resources.  In  order  to  do  this,  models  for intellectual property rights  IPR  management such as ODRL and indecs were developed.  Specialist  metadata  schemas  such  as  PREMIS,  MPEG-21  and METS Rights are also used for capturing and handling rights data for digital objects. Another aspect of ownership is provenance, which can affect the acceptance of the authenticity of an item and therefore its value. It is also   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 138  138 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  important in controlled environments where an audit trail of transactions may be required. The PROV metadata schema provides an avenue for handling provenance of digital objects including metadata and metadata schema.    Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 139  CHAPTER 9  Supporting e-commerce and e-government  Purpose 5   Overview This chapter considers the ways in which metadata is used for e-commerce and e- government.  It  describes  use  of  metadata  for  marketing  and  online  behavioural advertising. E-commerce is illustrated with an example from the book trade, ONIX, and with a description of music industry metadata and digital images. It finally looks at e- government, focusing on the documentary aspects of transactions and the role that metadata plays in facilitating these transactions.  Electronic transactions E-commerce and e-government are two sides of the same coin. They are about human  interaction  with  organisations  via  the  internet  that  result  in transactions of one kind or another. In the case of e-commerce that interaction is with commercial organisations. In e-government the interaction is with public bodies. E-government has a slightly wider definition, in that public education and information can also be considered a part of e-government even if it is not a part of a specific transaction.   The main difference between the two is that transactions with individuals may involve metadata behind the scenes, but do not require overt handling of metadata by the consumer. For instance if an individual is recording a life event via the internet  such as registering a death , the ‘Tell Us Once’ service in  the  UK  effectively  allows  surviving  relatives  to  complete  one  death registration  form  and  the  data  on  that  form  is  used  to  inform  the  local   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 140  140 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  authority, the tax authorities, benefits agencies, vehicle licensing, passport office and national savings accounts.   Many  e-commerce  and  e-government  systems  depend  on  tagging  metadata  to make their sites discoverable by target groups and the use of metadata in this way is explored in Chapter 6 on retrieving information. E- commerce and e-government systems also deal with personal data and data about website interactions using technologies such as cookies to track usage of a site. This raises privacy issues which are discussed in Chapter 14. This chapter includes a discussion about metadata for cookies in the context of online behavioural advertising, a major focus for e-commerce activity.   E-commerce Chaffey  2015, 13  defines e-commerce in the following terms: ‘e-commerce should be considered as all electronically mediated transactions between an organisation and a third party it deals with.’ Laudon and Traver  2014, 51  talk about ‘the use of the Internet, the World Wide Web  Web  and mobile apps to transact business’. E-commerce now plays a role in most businesses in their transactions with customers and with other businesses. As well as direct retail activities, businesses procure services and purchase products from suppliers using e-commerce applications.   Metadata plays a key role in the revenue-generating activities of social media giants such as Facebook, Google and Yahoo!. For instance, van Dijck  2013,  63–4   says:  ‘As  Facebook  owns  an  unprecedented  reservoir  of customised   meta data,  advertising  and  public  relations  are  becoming  a mixture of science and statistics, and therefore a lucrative business model.’ This  points  to  the  enormous  potential  being  realised  by  control  and management of metadata associated with use of internet resources. Talking about another major platform, he continues  2013, 93 : ‘Needless to say, both user-added  tags  and  automatic  tags  added  considerably  to  Flickr’s commercial  potential,  especially  in  the  area  of  app  development  and recommendation systems.’  Search engine optimisation The header of a web page will often contain meta-tags  i.e. metadata  that describe different attributes of that page. This information is used by browsers to help them present the pages in an appropriate way to users. Meta-tags are also used by search engines for display in search result listings and may also be used for ranking the search results. The metadata found in the headers of web pages may include the following:   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 141  SUPPORTING E-COMMERCE AND E-GOVERNMENT  PURPOSE 5   141    title   description   keywords   robot behaviour  index, noindex, follow, nofollow .  Image  tags  may  also  be  used  for  retrieval,  and  certainly  for  display. An ‘alternative description’ is commonly used so that an image description is given when a cursor is rolled over the image – a feature originally intended to help users with visual impairments. However, this Alt text provides a textual description of an image which assists retrieval as well. Metadata about language  or  country  may  also  be  useful  for  global  sites  with  different interfaces for different groups. For instance, invoking www.google.com will deliver the user to an appropriate country site, based on the IP address of the user. This may be important where there are different products available, different pricing, or different regulations that apply to transactions in each country. So, for instance, following the European Court of Justice ruling on Google  Spain , all the EU versions of Google provide a disclaimer at the bottom of the results page if it detects that you are doing a search on an individual, allowing it to comply with a European Court of Justice ruling in 2014: ‘Some results may have been removed under data protection law in Europe.’  Some search engines, such as Google.com and Bing.com, are set up to look for marked-up meta-tags in the items and to generate snippets for display in response to searches. So-called ‘rich snippets’ may be used to improve search results  or  enhance  the  display  of  search  listings.  These  may  include breadcrumb  trails,  ratings  reviews,  pricing  and  meta-descriptions.  Rich snippets are a form of semantic mark-up metadata in web pages that allow search engines to interpret their content more accurately and deliver relevant results pages to users. Google uses Schema.org  described in Chapter 12  as a standard for marking up semantic data.   Online behavioural advertising One of the major developments of the past ten years has been the growth of online behavioural advertising  OBA . This is probably the dominant feature of income generation on the internet. Although the sums associated with individual  transactions  may  be  small   cents  or  fractions  of  a  cent   the enormous volume of traffic means that major internet presences such as Google  via Alphabet, its holding company , Facebook and Yahoo! are now among the largest global corporations. The techniques used for tracking usage of  websites  and  clicks-through  to  target  sites  have  evolved  and  are  still   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 142  142 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  evolving, partly in response to regulation and partly to reflect changing user behaviour. In the early 2010s Facebook and others were using beacons, small pieces of code embedded in websites that could be placed within the user’s browser. This beacon is then detected and followed by the advertising agent. Cookies are another technology prevalent at the time of writing. These pieces of code contain some basic metadata  which varies according to the type of cookie . They may document things such as what sites have been clicked on, a timestamp for the click, as well as the last time the user was on the web and when the cookie was last invoked.   Figure  9.1  shows  a  simplified  information  flow  that  occurs  during  a browsing session with visits to two sites that are part of the same ad network. In the figure a user visits website A  step 1 . The website places a cookie on the user’s browser  step 2 . Later, the user visits website B which is part of the same ad network  step 3 . The cookie is detected by the ad network server  step 4 . The ad network server compares the user to an ad profile and the appropriate  ad  is  delivered  to  the  user  via  website  B   step  5 .  Activity associated with the cookie is also recorded as part of that user’s profile.  Figure 9.1 Cookie activity during a browsing session  Different types of cookie metadata are available, depending on the browser. For  instance,  Mozilla  Firefox   version  44   shows  the  following  metadata elements for session and persistent cookies:    Name – filename for the cookie   Content – a unique ID or name – value pair   Host – domain where the cookie applies   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 143  SUPPORTING E-COMMERCE AND E-GOVERNMENT  PURPOSE 5   143    Path – specific area of the domain where the cookie applies   Send for – allows for encrypted connections for sensitive data   Expires – this is a timestamp indicating how long the cookie persists for. If this value is blank, it is a session cookie which is deleted at the end of the session  i.e. when the browser is closed .  The Maximum Age is also sometimes included with some browsers to distinguish  between  session  and  persistent  cookies.  If  cookies  are unencrypted or are encrypted using standard encryption techniques, they may be susceptible to hijacking and fraud. In some cases it may be possible to gather up the transactional metadata associated with a cookie  credit card numbers, passwords to secure sites, personal contact details .  ‘the  development  and   Indecs and ONIX Bide   2011   talks  about  implementation  of communication standards in support of e-commerce: essentially, identifiers and  metadata.’ The  indecs  metadata  framework  described  in  Chapter  3 provides a way of modelling e-commerce transactions. Chapter 8 went on to describe indecs in the context of intellectual property rights. E-commerce involving intellectual property requires effective rights management to be in place.   The indecs model states that ‘People make stuff’ and this is the starting point for rights management and e-commerce. The indecs model states that ‘People use stuff’, which means that there is a market for intellectual property, including information resources. The third statement ‘People do deals about stuff’ is an acknowledgement that trade takes place. Although the indecs model is intended to deal with commercial transactions, it also deals with transactions such as lending from a public library. In the indecs model a library lends books  stuff  to library members  people  free at the point of use. Money transactions do of course occur at some stage; the library has to buy books and in some countries royalties may be payable to authors when their books are lent out.  In order to manage the metadata associated with e-commerce transactions, the indecs framework puts forward the following principles, which could be applied to other domains as well, and are therefore worth rehearsing here  Rust and Bide, 2000 :    Unique identification – ‘Every entity should be uniquely identified within  an identified namespace.’ This ties in with the axioms that metadata is modular, and that stuff is complex. Without a unique identifier for each   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 144  144 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  entity it becomes difficult and expensive to administer some aspects of the e-commerce chain. The principle goes on to describe the attributes of an identifier of uniqueness, stability, security and public availability of basic descriptive metadata for the entity identified.    Functional granularity – ‘It should be possible to identify an entity  whenever it needs to be distinguished.’ This means that an item should be capable of being identified at whatever level of granularity is appropriate. For a library this may be the entire collection, or for a music recording it may be a compilation of many pieces from different artists. However for royalty payments, it may be necessary to issue an identity to each individual work, each creator and each performer separately.    Designated authority – ‘The author of an item of metadata should be  securely identified.’ This is necessary to authenticate the metadata and to provide an audit trail.    Appropriate access – ‘Everyone requires access to the metadata on which  they depend, and privacy and confidentiality for their own metadata from those who are not dependent on it.’   The indecs framework forms the basis of the ONIX e-commerce metadata standard for handling works such as books, sound recordings, graphic arts and films.   Publishing and the book trade  Note: Material in this section is based on an interview in November 2016 with Graham Bell, the Director of EDItEUR.    EDItEUR, the agency that is responsible for the ONIX metadata standard, takes the view that metadata is there to help solve problems. In the library context  this  may  be  about  access  and  discovery,  but  for  the  commercial publishing industry it is about making the supply chain work. It may be about making sure a publisher’s books can be discovered by potential purchasers, whether they are library purchasers or individual consumers in a bookshop. The transfer of ONIX metadata between agents ensures that wholesalers and retailers know a book exists so that they can supply it to their customers. In the book trade metadata can be characterised as all the data that is concerned with a book from when it is conceived to when it is retailed and everything in between. It is all the data that is not the book itself. As well as information about  the  book,  there  will  be  workflow  information  associated  with  the publication,  not  just  bibliographic  data.  Metadata  is  used  for  internal workflow and for workflow associated with the supply chain as the book is moved between publishers, wholesalers, distributors and retailers or libraries.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 145  SUPPORTING E-COMMERCE AND E-GOVERNMENT  PURPOSE 5   145  The metadata may also include marketing material to help retailers sell the book as well as making the book discoverable by individual purchasers.  Because it is expensive to create and maintain metadata, only data that is strictly necessary to solve a specific business need is created. EDItEUR has developed technical standards to allow publishers, distributors, wholesalers, retailers, and the general public to get the metadata easily.   ONIX is based on the indecs model, which was the result of a three-year project  that  culminated  in  2000.  This  model  has  been  used  to  develop  a number of commercial metadata frameworks, including ONIX  for the book trade , ONIX-PC for periodicals, DDX for the recorded music business and EIDR for the film and entertainment sector – film, movies, TV. Although on the surface DDX, ONIX and EIDR appear very different, there are similarities at a deeper level, because they are based on the same data model.   There is a family of ONIX metadata standards. The classic standard is ONIX for Books. It is a trade metadata standard for communicating information about books, e-books and other book-like objects. This might include digital audio, such as a recording on a CD of someone reading a book.   ONIX-PC is the metadata standard for serials. This metadata is passed between  the  serial  publishers  and  aggregators  who  make  bundles  of  e- journals available for subscription by academic libraries, for instance.  Bibliographic data exchange – how ONIX works ONIX  is  a  message  that  goes  between  the  supplier  of  the  data  and  the recipient of the data  publisher and retailer . The publisher and retailer have their  own  systems  –  internal  databases  containing  bibliographic  info, workflow info, and marketing information. The publisher generates an ONIX record, usually expressed in XML. This metadata is sent to the retailer, who parses the data and ingests it into their retailer’s database. The databases are not standardised, but they can both handle ONIX records, allowing for data to  be  passed  between  them  as  part  of  an  e-commerce  transaction.  The publisher’s database will be optimised for the management of the data. They will be different, but there is a lingua franca for transfer of data between them. The message is standardised.   Ideally there should be a central aggregator sitting between publishers and retailers. However in the real world there are a combination of routes, as illustrated in Figure 9.2 on the next page  Bell, 2016 .  In practice there are multiple aggregators and a publisher may use more than one. Publishers may also deal directly with retailers, and some retailers  notably Amazon  act as both aggregators and retailers. Some metadata may pass  between  aggregators  so  that  a  publisher  obtains  information  from   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 146  146 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  Figure 9.2 ONIX e-commerce transactions  multiple  sources.  The  use  of  aggregators  makes  it  much  cheaper  for publishers  and  retailers.  The  use  of  a  common  standard  reduces  the duplication  of  effort  that  would  otherwise  be  necessary  to  distribute publications via a variety of outlets. There are some inefficiencies built into the market. At the time of writing, iBooks, the Apple Inc. system, does not accept ONIX records. That means that publishers who wish to distribute their publications via the iBooks platform have to produce duplicate metadata to Apple’s standards.  Trade in static and moving images Commercial image libraries have been around for some time and services such as Getty Images and iStockphoto provide a marketplace for down - loading digital images for commercial use. Sites that provide a platform for independent photographers, small businesses and amateur photographers to sell their images for re-use include iStockphoto, Flickr, Creative Commons and  others.  Some  providers  also  allow  access  to  archival  images  for educational or even commercial use. In these systems metadata can be seen as having three roles, which together form the basis of an e-commerce system:   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 147  SUPPORTING E-COMMERCE AND E-GOVERNMENT  PURPOSE 5   147    retrieval and description of images   management of rights such as re-use of images   payment transactions to cover the cost of licences.  The IPTC Photo Metadata standard  described in Chapter 4  contains human- readable metadata which can be embedded in a JPEG or TIFF file. It can also be held externally in a Digital Asset Management system or in an XMP file.  Music industry metadata In  the  1990s  the  music  industry  underwent  a  major  and  traumatic transformation. With the increasing availability of music in digital formats, first on CDs, then on MP3 players such as iPods, there has been huge demand for digital music. Increasing storage capacity, improved data compression, and longer battery life have all created increased demand for digital music. Enterprising souls have created media-sharing sites where downloaded or ‘ripped’  i.e. read off a CD and stored on a hard drive  music is made available free of charge to members, or members are allowed access for a fixed fee. This has caused a great deal of tension and has arguably undermined the revenue model of the music industry that has persisted for many years. There are two aspects to the metadata requirements for digital music.  The first is a retrieval issue. How do you make a music track or an album discoverable  and  accessible  to  your  target  audience?  Apart  from  the promotional  activity  that  takes  place,  it  is  important  that  individual consumers are able to find the track that they want. This may mean offering retrieval by Artist, Composer, Performer, Band Orchestra, Date, Location of the  recording,  Track  name,  Album  name,  Genre,  etc.  Then  there  is  the technical data about the compression system used  lossy or non-lossy , the file format and the resolution of the recording as well as the storage capacity required to hold it on a portable device.   One of the great benefits of WAV, MP3 and other digital music data formats is the ability to tag recordings with additional metadata. Apps that use these formats, such as iTunes and Spotify, can exploit those tags as well as storing additional information about tracks, such as when they were last played, what playlists they belong to and images from the album cover. These systems allow  users  to  tag  by  genre,  other  keywords,  or  simply  that  they  are favourites.  Standards  such  as  MP3  contains  a  header  with  technical information that allows a play-back device to correctly interpret and render the content to a listener. The main body of the file is a bitstream of the music itself.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 148  148 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  In addition to the embedded metadata for an MP3 or WAV file, there is a de  facto standard,  ID3v2,  which  covers  user-oriented  aspects  of  audio recordings such as Title, Composer, Playlist, Performer, Orchestra or band, Date of recording, Soloist, and Copyright information. This metadata can be used by applications for delivery of the recordings to users such as Windows Media Player, VLC, iTunes or Arpeggio. These tags can also be used by file- sharing  sites  and  sites  that  make  music  tracks  available  via  Creative Commons licences such as: Mp3.com, Made Loud, Amazon mp3, Sound Cloud and Jamendo. An MP3 file can be embedded in an ID3 file so that the metadata tags are handled with the actual music file.   The  second  aspect  of  metadata  for  digital  music  is  about  rights management. This is a commercial issue – about payments and royalties. Accurate  transmission  of  rights  information  is  vitally  important  for  the recording  industry  and  crucial  for  the  artists  who  receive  royalties.  The growth of tours by artists who released hits in the 1970s and 80s has been driven by the need to generate income in the shadow of massively declining royalties.  The  music  trading  sites  also  use  the  intellectual  property information associated with MP3 files or included in ID3v2 files, such as artist names, copyright statements, producers, and links to appropriate websites. This means that when a track is downloaded via iTunes, Amazon Music or a similar service, the rights information is passed to the record company which aggregates this data so that periodic royalty payments can be made to the artist s .  The  aggregated  data  may  be  handled  by  a  dedicated  rights management system which keeps track of payments made and payments due to the artists.  E-government The  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development   OECD  defines e-government as  Field, Muller and Lau, 2003 : ‘The use of information and communication technologies, and particularly the Internet, as a tool to achieve better government.’ Bhatnagar  2009  suggests that e-government can be seen as an extension of e-commerce: ‘For those who see it as some form of extension of e-commerce to the domain of the government, it represents the use of the Internet to deliver information and services by the government.’ It encompasses a range of interactions between government and citizens and between government and businesses. This includes delivery of information, downloading forms and online form-filling. Examples of e-government in practice  include  filing  tax  returns,  registering  businesses,  applying  for passports and voting. The Federal Government of the USA has identified metadata elements for description of government digital resources  Central   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 149  SUPPORTING E-COMMERCE AND E-GOVERNMENT  PURPOSE 5   149  Information Office, 2016 . This schema is primarily for listing data sets in the Project Open Data directory.  In the UK the move towards e-government prompted the development of eGMS  e-Government Unit, 2006  the e-government metadata standard, a Dublin  Core  application  profile.  This  standard,  which  is  no  longer maintained, and is no longer mandated for use of government websites, was primarily designed for retrieval of resources on official government websites. In Australia the Australian Government Locator Service  National Archives of Australia, 2010  was designed for a similar purpose and also focused on discoverability  of  government  online  resources.  Like  eGMS  it  is  also  an application profile of Dublin Core and has become a metadata standard for use within national government. Because much of government information has  a  geographic  aspect  there  is  some  emphasis  on  spatial  metadata  in government metadata standards. Standards such as ISO 19115  ISO, 2014a  are coming to the fore and focus primarily on the location of data collections and services.  The European Commission  2011  has suggested ‘Metadata is an important asset for eGovernment systems development and as such should be carefully and  professionally  managed’. It  has  been  responsible  for  a  number  of initiatives to facilitate exchange of data between public sector organisations within members states as well as between member states and interoperability continues to be a priority  Bovalis et al., 2014 .  A  great  deal  of  e-government’s  focus  is  on  Open  Data  and  activity  is currently focused on linked data initiatives, described in Chapters 3 and 13. This  perhaps  represents  a  general  move  towards  greater  private  sector participation in the delivery of public services.   Conclusion E-commerce and e-government have much in common. They are both about facilitating  transactions  between  suppliers government  and  consumers  citizens. That said, there are some significant differences. E-commerce deals with transactions between businesses, where there is a need to make the supply  chain  work  effectively,  as  exemplified  by  the  book  trade  system, ONIX. It also encompasses business–consumer interactions. E-government tends to focus on electronic transactions between government and citizens or individuals, although public sector procurement systems are business-to- business.

The first part of the chapter considers the role of metadata in privacy, freedom of information and legal admissibility of documents. It then goes on to explore the use of metadata to facilitate regulatory compliance. This demonstrates approaches to document and information management and to metadata policies which contribute to the overall ability of organisations to comply with regulatory requirements.  Governance and risk Information governance is a major preoccupation for many organisations. Not  only  is  there  legislative  pressure  from  freedom  of  information  and privacy  legislation  around  the  world,  but  there  is  also  a  concern  about managing risk. Data loss, malicious access, poor data quality and lack of interoperability can all have a profound effect on the viability of a business or integrity of a public service. Reports in the press of data breaches have led to loss of reputation which can have a real effect on sales. Security breaches can also lead to direct financial loss as well as lost opportunities and exposure to further threats.  As well as the generic risks, many corporations operate in regulated sectors or  markets  and  have  to  be  able  to  demonstrate  compliance.  There  are increasing  global  pressures  for  multinational  enterprises  to  comply  with national  legislation  in  the  markets  in  which  they  operate.  National governments  and  international  bodies  are  co-operating  to  ensure  that   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 152  152 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  regulations are applied across the board and that potential loopholes are closed off.  Responses to these pressures by professional bodies such as computing, information management, document and records management and library and information services have resulted in new approaches and practices. These professional bodies also play an important role in setting standards and providing training for professionals responsible for compliance. This chapter identifies these areas and looks at ways in which metadata has been used as a part of information governance. It could be argued that metadata is an  information  resource  that  itself  is  subject  to  governance  and  this  is discussed in Chapter 11.  Authentication Records  management  and  good  governance  depends  on  being  able  to demonstrate the authenticity of a record and to provide documentation about its history and the way it has been managed. This may include details of transactions that have taken place: who viewed a particular document and when, what changes were made to the document during its history and the measures adopted to ensure that unauthorised changes have not taken place. This provides the basis for legislation on the legal admissibility of electronic documents and whether they can be used as evidence in legal proceedings. Provenance and preservation metadata has an important role to play in authenticating digital documents, as well as providing an audit trail of actions that have been performed on documents  such as access, amendments, or deletions . Duranti  1989  puts forward a new role for ‘diplomatics’  the authentication of documents – diplomas, certificates or diplomatic docu - ments . Duranti and Rogers have gone on to develop the idea of diplomatics adapted for authenticating records stored in the cloud and using metadata to achieve this:  In digital forensics, the strength of circumstantial digital evidence could be increased by metadata which record 1  the exact dates and times of any document sent or received; 2  which computer s  actually created them; and 3  which computer s  received them. Also a chain of legitimate custody  or chain of evidence, in legal terms  is ground for inferring authenticity and authenticate a record, and so is a digital chain of custody, that is, the information preserved about the record and its changes, showing that specific data was in a particular state at a given date and time.   Duranti and Rogers, 2012, 526–7   Metadata can assist in compliance by providing an audit trail of who has   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 153  INFORMATION GOVERNANCE  PURPOSE 6   153  accessed  personal  data  or  records  on  individuals  and  who  has  updated personal information. It can also be used to control who has access to which data. The existence of processes for controlling access is an important strand in overall information security and accountability and in managing risk.  Information governance Information governance is an important part of the corporate agenda. Public- sector and third-sector organisations are also under increasing scrutiny to demonstrate  transparency  and  to  counter  perceptions  of  corruption. Information governance is a wide term that is taken to mean governance of information technology, data governance and governance of information held in documents  whatever their form . Here we concentrate on the last of these definitions.  However,  it  is  important  to  recognise  the  overlap  between definitions.  Information  governance  is  sometimes  seen  as  part  of  IT governance. Definitions are important because to some extent they determine who is responsible for information governance: lawyers, records managers, librarians or the IT department. The predominating professional culture will determine the way in which this issue is handled. The corporate context is also  very  important.  For  instance,  regulated  industries  such  as  pharma - ceuticals or financial services have specific reporting requirements that affect the way in which they handle information.  Although  the  role  of  metadata  in  ensuring  information  governance  is recognised, there are few practical guides. Blackburn, Smallwood and Earley  2014  consider some of the questions that arise in information governance and suggest that metadata may be a way to address some of these questions. Information governance may in some organisations be closely tied in with records management and with information security. Both areas are subject to compliance  issues  and  meeting  regulatory  standards  is  one  of  the  major focuses for information governance activity. The role of metadata in records management has been discussed in Chapter 7. It looked at the way in which metadata is used to manage and track records throughout their lifecycle. This is particularly the case of electronic records and by extension, digital assets. Information governance may be driven by the management of information risk,  such  as  the  risks  associated  with  data  breaches,  data  loss,  disaster recovery and non-compliance with regulations. In order to get a handle on this we shall break down information governance into several distinct areas: information  compliance,  e-discovery,  information  risk  and  sectoral compliance.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 154  154 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  Compliance  freedom of information and data protection  Freedom of information Freedom of information  FoI  legislation is in place in more than 100 countries worldwide, including most of the leading economies. It provides a way of ensuring that the business of government is transparent and accountable to the people. However, it means different things in different countries and its scope varies widely. For instance, in the UK it applies across the public sector and has been estimated to cover more than 70,000 organisations. Anyone has the right, regardless of nationality or location, to request access to information covered by the Act without having to provide a justification or reason. For its part the public sector in the UK can refuse on the grounds of vexatious or repetitive requests, cost, or a declared intention to publish the information according to a published schedule. There are also specific exemptions on the grounds of national security, commercial confidentiality, current court cases and the formulation of government policy.  The most obvious role for metadata is to make records discoverable so that they can easily be retrieved and made available to enquirers. If a publication scheme has been developed, there will be published categories of information, which should be included in the metadata of individual documents or records to  allow  access  via  that  route.  Other  captured  metadata  in  a  document management system that may be useful for FoI enquiries include: previous requests for that information; originating department; file title; author names; and date of creation. The ability to record this information will depend on what metadata schema has been used.  Privacy and data protection The Snowden revelations have generated a great deal of discussion about information privacy, particularly as it relates to metadata  Greenwald, 2013 . Snowden reported that the US National Security Agency  NSA  had been requiring telecoms providers such as Verizon to hand over metadata about telephone calls made between the USA and foreign countries or within the USA. This was done under the provisions of the Homeland Security Act that was passed in the aftermath of the September 11th attack on the World Trade Centre Towers in New York in 2001. Although the NSA did not require the content  of  the  telephone  calls  themselves   that  is  handled  by  a  separate agency , they required the telecoms provider to systematically gather and hand over the following:    details of both parties to the phone call   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 155  INFORMATION GOVERNANCE  PURPOSE 6   155    time of the call   duration of call   when the call was made   location of the devices  if a cell-phone call    unique identifiers.  This has had some effect on legislators and regulators and an impact on trade relations between major trading blocks such as the USA and the European Union.  Notably,  the  EU-US  Safe  Harbour  agreement  which  allowed  US companies to process personal data of EU citizens, was struck down in 2015, in part because of the systematic and routine gathering of metadata about phone calls by the US government.   The European Union is characterised by general privacy legislation that applies  across  all  sectors.  The  EU  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  is principles-based  European Parliament and European Council, 2016 . The European legislation is enforced by national data protection authorities in the member states. In the USA privacy protection is industry-based, covering consumers  interacting  with  specific  industries  such  as  health   Health Insurance  Portability  and  Accessibility  Act ,  credit  agencies   Fair  Credit Reporting Act  and Federal agencies  Privacy Act of 1974 .   Where privacy legislation applies, it is important for information managers to demonstrate that personal data is handled appropriately. This may mean codifying the personal data according to how sensitive it is and controlling who has access to it when and how. For instance, Article 9 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation prohibits the processing of sensitive personal data unless strict conditions are met:  Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation shall be prohibited.   European Parliament and European Council, 2016   Personal data is not metadata unless associated with a document of some kind. However, the management of personal data requires metadata about that data. Properties of personal data, such as how sensitive it is, are classed as metadata. Other attributes, such as who input the data, when it was last updated and whether it has been checked for accuracy, are all metadata elements  that  are  used  to  manage  personal  data  about  employees,  for instance.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 156  156 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  In the context of records management, file plans are a well established way of determining how documents containing personal data should be handled. The alternative of allocating security levels to individual documents or classes of document and then restricting access to those who have the appropriate level  of  security  clearance  can  be  complicated  to  administer.  Individual managers may need access to personal details of their staff, but would not normally have access to personal data of staff in other departments.   Privacy also arises in the case of social media, where individuals create personal profiles. These are supplemented with behavioural data which is gathered by the provider and may be made available at varying levels to other users, and third parties such as online advertisers. Privacy and surveillance is discussed further in Chapter 14.  E-discovery  legal admissibility  Companies may be subject to court cases where e-discovery plays a role in compliance   Tallon,  Ramirez  and  Short,  2013 .  The  use  of  metadata  for information  retrieval  is  covered  in  more  detail  in  Chapter  6.  Legal admissibility of electronic documents and digitised images depends on the accompanying documentation and certification attesting to its authenticity. Metadata provides a way of recording details of the circumstances of creation of a document  date of creation, author, editor, etc.  and actions that have taken place since – an audit trail of who has accessed the document and any changes that have taken place – what the amendments were and who made them, and when. As Chapter 2 discussed, many apps  e.g. Microsoft Word  automatically attach their own metadata to electronic documents when they are created and this can provide an audit trail for the document as it is drafted and altered.  There  is  no  way  to  verify  the  authenticity  of  a  document  without information about its history and what has happened to it since its creation. For  this,  metadata  is  necessary.  The  authenticity  of  information  can  be determined by means of physical certificates to indicate that the document has been checked or that a specific procedure has been followed, or via the metadata embedded in the resource or held separately in a database.  Information risk, information security and disaster recovery Data about the sensitivity, source, quality and use of information can form an important strand of an information governance framework. Metadata itself can  be  sensitive  and  needs  to  be  appropriately  managed  and  protected. Security of metadata is discussed in Chapter 11. This section considers the   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 157  INFORMATION GOVERNANCE  PURPOSE 6   157  role of metadata in securing information as a part of the management of information security.  The nature of risk The use of metadata to manage information risk is predicated upon a good understanding  of  what  constitutes  risk.  Many  people  will  recognise  a situation as being risky without a clear understanding of what risk actually is. A risk is commonly understood to be a threat. A more rigorous approach defines risk as: an uncertain event with consequences that impact on an area of activity or interested party. Or simply put, the ‘effect of uncertainty on objectives’  ISO, 2009e . There are two dimensions to risk – probability and impact: How likely is the event to occur? What impact will the event have if it does occur? There is a tendency to try and quantify risk by expressing it in financial terms.  Data breaches Data breaches present a number of challenges to the organisation, including loss of reputation, loss of customers, regulatory penalties such as fines and waste of time and effort dealing with the breach. The likelihood of a data breach may be reduced by an active information security programme in which metadata plays a part.  Information security Information  security  will  depend  on  a  number  of  approaches,  including physical security, hardware, firewalls and communications measures, as well as procedures and effective management of the data. Using metadata to log the location of sensitive data, who has access to it and how it is used provides a  mechanism  for  control  and  for  detecting  data  breaches.  For  instance metadata can be used for forensic analysis of database attacks  Khanuja and Suratkar, 2014 . The previously mentioned use of metadata to establish the authenticity and provenance of data is also a significant contribution to data security  Jansen, 2014 .  Description of metadata In  the  early  2000s  some  researchers  were  already  developing  metadata vocabularies with the explicit purpose of controlling quality and security of data. The HIDDEL  Health Information Disclosure, Description and Evaluation   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 158  158 PART II PURPOSES OF METADATA  Language  project created a data model describing health websites and health information  providers   Eysenbach  et  al.,  2001 .  This  allows  evaluation  of websites and providers but does not go into a great deal of detail about the individual data elements. De Vries et al.  2014  propose a system of ethical metadata which provides a context for medical and ethnic data gathered in the course of malaria research in Africa. Although they do not develop a specific standard for this type of metadata they describe its potential role and the benefits:  By way of solution we would propose that at least some information about the normative context of sample collection and data sharing – what we called ethical metadata – needs to be taken into account when data sharing decisions are to be made. This may particularly be the case where research is conducted on identifiable population groups where stigma or discrimination are of concern.   de Vries et al., 2014   Skinner, Han and Chang  2005  describe a concept of Meta Privacy, which not only encompasses secure metadata, but also uses metadata to manage the security of a data collection:  An approach that is of relevance to Meta Privacy is the use of meta-information for privacy protection. Meta privacy tags and metadata can be used for entity privacy policy preferences representation and enforcement.   Skinner, Han and Chang, 2005, 58   Sectoral compliance There is very little reported research on the role of metadata in compliance. Kerrigan  and  Law   2005   report  on  the  development  of  an  engineering application to extract compliance metadata about environmental regulations which can then be applied to documents for automatic logic processing of engineering  documentation.  Singh  and  Kumar   2014   consider  ways  of complying with data regulations affecting cloud computing. They propose a four-layer architecture: identification, classification, routing and storage. In this proposed system data is routed to the appropriate data centres depending on  the  type  of  regulation  that  applies  to  it.  They  talk  about  metadata associated with Virtual Appliances  VAP  used to process data so that it ends up in the appropriate category of data centre.   The REGNET research project in the USA developed a number of tools and methods  ‘to  facilitate  access,  compliance  and  analysis  of  government regulations’  Law et al., 2014 . Among the methods developed, the researchers   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 159  INFORMATION GOVERNANCE  PURPOSE 6   159  use metadata to help with mapping between different terminologies. They also use metadata about the regulations to retrieve relevant documents, and relevant  sections  within  those  documents.  They  have  also  created  ‘logic metadata’ to allow processing by an expert system to represent rules and concepts  from  regulations.  This  is  particularly  important  in  reconciling overlapping regulations and inconsistencies between them.  Conclusion Metadata contributes to the authentication of documents and data and this is probably the main way in which metadata is currently used for facilitating information  governance.  Information  retrieval  or   e-discovery   is  also important  for  access  to  regulations  and  this  is  the  other  major  role  for metadata. Projects such as REGNET have explored ways in which metadata can play a role in interfaces between regulators and companies through expert systems, for instance. Using metadata to describe access requirements for data and to identify sensitive data elements has also been tried. Neither of these approaches have been widely adopted at the time of writing but may develop into more-widely available products and services.

Chapter 11 refers back to the metadata concepts in Part I and identifies some of the issues that arise when developing and implementing metadata standards, such as quality and security. One way of addressing the quality issue is to have some control over the way in which metadata  content  is  created.  Chapter  12  considers  the  ways  in  which taxonomies  and  other  controlled  vocabularies  can  be  used  to  improve metadata quality. Cataloguing rules are also important in this context as are authority files. Chapter 13 looks at very large collections of data, especially research data and official data released by public authorities. These require special consideration because of expansion of linked data and the emphasis on re-usability of public data. This raises ethical and political issues about the control and management of information as well as privacy and human rights, the topic for Chapter 14. This last chapter also peers into the future and speculates on which professional groups will be responsible for metadata management and use.

The project lifecycle concept is used as the framework for discussion of metadata management. The management of metadata starts with analysing metadata requirements and moves on to the development and selection of metadata schemas. There is then a discussion about encoding metadata and the use of controlled vocabulary before turning to content rules. Interoperability of metadata schemas focuses on crosswalks and metadata registries. Quality management covers the use of administrative metadata and reviews issues such as security of information. The final part of the chapter looks at user education and the presentation and use of search aids to make metadata more accessible. The chapter concludes with a view on convergence of management practice for metadata across the domains.  Metadata is an information resource  Managing metadata, like other aspects of information management, has to be appropriate to the requirements of its users and fit for purpose. If the metadata is too detailed, it is costly to maintain. If it is not detailed enough, the functionality is severely limited. Metadata must be applied in a consistent way  and  should  be  retrievable  by  those  who  need  access  to  it.  The management of metadata can be seen as a series of stages, although in most instances a user will only be concerned with one or two stages in the cycle.    Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 164  164 PART III MANAGING METADATA  Metadata is an information resource and as such can be described in terms  of a lifecycle with specific activities and processes at each stage:     Analysing metadata requirements – This will be determined by the main  purpose  or purposes  of the metadata.    Selecting and developing metadata schemas – Factors such as the nature of  the data being described, the community using it, and pre-existing conventions and standards need to be taken into account.    Encoding and maintenance of controlled vocabularies – Many metadata  standards do not specify what encoding is used. Controlled vocabularies can be developed and maintained using thesaurus techniques.    Applying metadata – Cataloguing rules can be used to ensure consistency  in the way in which metadata is applied.    Importing metadata – The choice of source of metadata to import will  depend on factors such as the quality of data available and its compatibility. Crosswalks and metadata registries provide a means of mapping between different schemas.    Quality control – Issues such as security are an important way of  maintaining the integrity and therefore quality of data.    Search aids and user education – Making users aware of the options  available to them helps them to exploit data sources more effectively.  Workflow and metadata lifecycle There is no single model of data or metadata lifecycle suited to all applications and approaches. The aim of this section is to identify some of the models that have been used and to provide an understanding of some of the principles that apply to the management of data lifecycles, so that the reader is in a better position to select and apply operations that are appropriate to their situation. Greenberg  2009  explores the lifecycle concept as a useful framework for managing metadata. She proposes to do this in the context of the Dryad digital  repository  of  data  underpinning  scientific  and  medical  research publications.  She concludes that, in the absence of any unifying theoretical framework for metadata, the lifecycle concept is a useful basis for capturing, creating and processing metadata and the digital materials that it describes. Previously a ten-stage metadata lifecycle was proposed for digital collections  Chen, Chen and Lin, 2003  with the following stages:  Group I Requirement assessment and content analysis 1 Acquiring basic metadata needs 2 Assessment of deep metadata needs   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 165  MANAGING METADATA  165  3 Review of standards and projects 4 Analysis of elements and standards Group II System requirement specification  5 Preparation of metadata specification 6 Evaluation of metadata systems Group III Metadata system 7 Preparation of guidance and best practice 8 Development of metadata system Group IV Service and evaluation 9 Maintenance of metadata service 10 Evaluation of metadata performance  This ties in with a wider concept of the information lifecycle which has been expressed in a number of contexts, such as records management, digital curation and electronic publications. To some extent digital lifecycles can be applied to metadata, which is itself a type of digital resource. The Digital Curation Centre’s  2010  digital lifecycle model discussed in Chapter 7 can be applied to data collections, including metadata collections. The Create or Receive, Ingest, Preserve, Store, Access and Re-use, and Dispose steps are most  directly  applicable  to  metadata.  The  Transform  step  may  apply  to conversion of metadata to other formats for export or exchange, or could refer to the addition and modification of metadata records to reflect the life of a document or digital resource.  Project approach An alternative approach is a project lifecycle  Figure 11.1 over the page , which can be adopted for the development and management of metadata as described in the previous edition of this book  Haynes, 2004 .   In this model the analysis of metadata requirements sets the criteria for selecting  an  appropriate  scheme  or  developing  a  schema  or  application profile. The selection may be constrained by issues such as who else is using this standard, and practical issues of cost of development of a purpose-made metadata schema. The next stage is to define the vocabulary used in each of the fields  in database terms, a data dictionary . The metadata is then applied to items or it may be imported from a third party, which introduces further issues of cataloguing standards. The quality management processes help to ensure a consistently indexed resource that is suitable for searching and other user interactions.

One of the challenges of a manager is to weigh up the relative benefits of developing a schema that suits a particular application or type of information resource and the use of a commonly  accepted  standard  that  allows  for  interchange  of  data.  In  the bibliographic world standards such as MARC 21 have long been established for exchange of bibliographic metadata between applications. This does not prevent the applications from having their own internal standards – especially for transactional data such as acquisitions and circulation control. Establishing the  metadata  requirements  helps  managers  to  navigate  through  the challenges of selecting or developing an appropriate metadata schema for the data resources he or she is responsible for.  Having a clear idea of requirements and a specification will provide a basis  for review of decisions and for reviews of metadata strategy.   It is useful to consider the purpose of the metadata collection. There may be  several  reasons  for  collecting creating  metadata,  such  as  collection management; resource discovery by learners, preservation, or dissemination of research. If so, it is likely that one purpose will predominate, although   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 167  MANAGING METADATA  167  others will need to be taken into account. For instance, metadata may be used primarily  for  retrieval,  but  description  and  identification  may  be  other important requirements.  In practice most metadata schemas have resource description as one of their purposes but they are usually used for a variety of purposes. For instance, library standards such as MARC 21, while dealing with resource description, are also used for information retrieval in library catalogues and resource management  in  library  management  systems.  Metadata  associated  with records  management  and  preservation  is  an  example  of  management  of information,  but  there  is  often  an  information  retrieval  aspect  as  well. Metadata  associated  with  ONIX  is  used  for  rights  management  and  e- commerce.  The  analysis  of  requirements  has  to  take  into  account  what  is  being described, the systems it needs to interact with, the level of granularity that has to be supported, the user community, existing standards and the format of pre-existing metadata. It will also be necessary to take into account the software environment under which the metadata will operate.   Who will be using the metadata, and how? The profile of users  including managers and information staff, as well as the eventual audience  is arguably the most important consideration. What is its overall purpose? This needs to be taken into account in developing a management approach for a metadata collection. A requirements checklist might include the following:    data collection or resource being described   environment of operation  software    availability of existing metadata   standards   who will be using the metadata   resources available to create and maintain the metadata   need for vocabulary control   operations carried out on the metadata collections.  Selecting and developing metadata schemas A sense of the variety of metadata standards available can be had from the Digital Curation Centre’s  2017  disciplinary metadata resource. This provides access to a database of metadata standards developed for collections of digital materials in different subject areas. It also provides links to resources such as vocabularies, ontologies and tools for handling metadata. Metadata registries are  discussed  in  more  detail  later  in  this  chapter.  The  extent  to  which  a metadata schema is used and accepted by a community of interest will also   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 168  168 PART III MANAGING METADATA  affect the choice of schema. If there is a de facto industry standard or a formal ISO  standard  this  should  be  taken  into  account.  In  some  instances  the standard may be mandatory. However, there may be wider requirements of the  application  area  itself  or  specialist  requirements  that  a  mandatory standard  may  not  be  sufficiently  detailed  to  address,  in  which  case  the standard becomes one of a number of requirements that should be taken into account. Working with partners, for instance other members of a cataloguing union for libraries, or trading partners in the publishing industry, will focus the choice of schemas to those that are widely adopted within the industry. For the book trade this could mean the ONIX system or application profiles based  on  ONIX.  Libraries  often  use  MARC  21  as  a  common  format  for metadata,  especially  for  exchange  of  data  or  searching  across  different catalogues, and the ability to handle records is a feature of many library management  systems.  As  with  any  project,  there  is  a  danger  of  over- specifying metadata requirements. There are ongoing costs associated with each  piece  of  metadata  and  the  more  detailed  and  complex,  the  more expensive the system will be to set up and to maintain. If extensive indexing or  tagging  is  required,  it  may  involve  human  time  and  effort.  In  some instances, such as e-commerce, it may be appropriate to create and maintain very detailed records, because of the benefits associated with automating numerous individual transactions. Compromises may also have to be made between  the  availability  of  pre-existing  data,  which  may  be  beyond immediate  requirements  but  would  be  expensive  to  re-create  to  another standard.  There  are  other  considerations  in  selecting  and  developing metadata schemas:    Whatever the primary purpose of the metadata, there will usually be a requirement to be able to identify individual elements and to retrieve items described by the metadata. Some metadata schemas are geared to support search and retrieval capabilities.    Some data needs to be held in a secure environment, to protect personal  privacy for instance, or needs to be secure against unauthorised access and interference. This is a particular issue for e-commerce systems. The security and authentication capabilities built into the schema will affect the choices available.    Maintenance of metadata standards – are they stable or rapidly  evolving? If evolving, are they backwards compatible, so that old metadata is still valid?    Availability of schema expressed in mark-up languages such as XML or  as RDF.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 169  MANAGING METADATA  169  Importing metadata Metadata has long been imported from other sources or repositories. Many libraries  import  bibliographic  records  rather  than  cataloguing  new acquisitions. Cataloguing authorities such as the Library of Congress or the British Library, or bibliographic service organisations such as OCLC, Neilson, or  Bibliographic  Data  Services  Ltd,  sell  records  to  libraries.  Importing metadata requires good selection procedures, quality control and adherence to a common data standard. Additional work may be needed to clean the data and to reconfigure it to fit the destination system.   Automatic generation of metadata The idea of automatic metadata generation has been around for some time. For instance, Rodriguez, Bollen and Van de Sompel  2009  consider ways of propagating metadata from existing sources of rich metadata. Metadata can also be inferred from other metadata expressed in ontologies such as OWL  Web Ontology Language, see p. 195  or schema.org. In their review of semi- automatic metadata generation tools Park and Brenza  2015  identify six methods:  1 metatag extraction 2 content extraction 3 automatic indexing 4 text and data mining 5 extrinsic data auto-generation 6 social tagging.  They conclude that there is a lot of potential for this approach in light of the large volume of material that needs to be processed and the cost of staff to do so manually. They accept that some human intervention is necessary, hence the designation ‘semi-automatic’. Many of the tools that they reviewed use a combination of these methods. The authors conclude that while the 39 tools that  they  reviewed  offered  many  potential  benefits,  a  major  barrier  to implementation is the very specific nature of the tools, which were mostly designed for a very specific domain or data set.   Tools for auto-generation of metadata provide only partial coverage of metadata  elements,  which  means  that  human  intervention  is  inevitable. Automated  metadata  generation  will  require  considerable  investment  to integrate  the  tools  and  to  make  the  resulting  product  more  generally applicable and capable of dealing with a wider variety of sources, document formats and metadata standards.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 170  170 PART III MANAGING METADATA  Application profiles Many  metadata  schemas  encourage  users  to  adopt  standard  metadata elements  that  are  appropriate  to  their  needs.  However,  additional  data elements can be created to fulfil specific requirements of the application. It is also possible to adopt metadata elements from different schemas using a ‘mix and match’ approach. Application profiles provide a way of re-using existing metadata  standards   or  data  elements  from  within  those  standards   and facilitate interoperability by the common use of existing standards. Nilsson, Baker and Johnston  2008  define application profiles in terms of a process to build functional requirements.  For  example,  the  Singapore  Framework  for  Dublin  Core  Application Profiles was developed within the Dublin Core community. It can be used with other metadata standards, schemas and encoding schemes  Nilsson, Baker  and  Johnston,  2008 .  It  has  the  following  components,  which  are illustrated in Figure 11.2:    functional requirements  mandatory    domain model  mandatory    description set profile  dsp   mandatory    usage guidelines  optional    encoding syntax guidelines  optional .

It is important to have a clear view of what is meant by interoperability, before explaining the role of metadata in this context. Some definitions focus on the storage of data in a standard format. A good example can be found in libraries, where the MARC 21 format is used to exchange bibliographic records between systems. This does not mean that the library management systems themselves have to store data internally in MARC 21 format. Indeed, many of these systems have additional proprietary metadata elements. The internal architecture of the library  management  system  may  make  a  proprietary  data  structure  more appropriate. However, the ability to generate output in a standard format and to import records in an agreed format allows the exchange of data between systems. For instance, in a relational database system a bibliographic record is created at the point of querying the system. The different fields comprising that virtual record are stored in separate tables. Applying a bibliographic standard that  is  based  on  discrete  records  in  a  flat  file  structure  may  not  be  easily translated into a relational system. The indecs initiative defines interoperability as  Rust and Bide, 2000 : ‘enabling information that originates in one context to be used in another in ways that are as highly automated as possible’. This definition  focuses  on  the  information  aspect  and  the  requirement  to  use information  in  different  contexts  from  its  origin.  It  also  highlights  the automated nature of transactions.   The above definitions suggest that metadata may be used to facilitate the exchange of information between systems. However, the data must be capable of being used by other systems. The implication is that the data is used by different systems to achieve a common end  such as the successful purchase of  a  product .  Nilsson,  Baker  and  Johnston   2009   have  developed  an interoperability model. It defines four levels of compatibility that can be used to assess the interoperability of applications with Dublin Core:  Level 1: Shared term definitions Level 2: Formal semantic interoperability Level 3: Description set syntactic interoperability Level 4: Description set profile interoperability  There are two contexts for metadata and interoperability: metadata as a tool to facilitate exchange of information between interoperating systems, and interoperability of metadata schemas themselves. Weibel  1998  suggests that there are three different types of interoperability: semantic, structural and syntactic interoperability. They are defined as follows:   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 172  172 PART III MANAGING METADATA    semantic interoperability – ‘achieved through agreements about content  description standards’: for example, the agreement between RSC and the ISBD Review Group for mapping between ISBD and RDA  RDA Steering Committee, 2015     structural interoperability – a data model such as RDF  resource  description framework  that is used for specifying semantic schemas   syntactic interoperability – an example is XML, which provides a syntax  for expressing metadata. It is about how to mark up and tag data to enable it to be exchanged and shared with other applications.  In the context of digital libraries, metadata interoperability can be defined in terms of activities  Arms et al., 2002; Hillmann, Dunsire and Phipps, 2013 :    federation – where metadata from different sources conforms to a  particular standard and is kept up to date. This can be expensive to implement and so tends to be used where there are significant benefits. An example of this is interoperability of library catalogues adhering to Z39.50.    harvesting – where each participant makes metadata about its collection available in a simple exchange format. The data is harvested by service providers. This is good for heterogeneous services. An example is the OAI – this is considered less expensive for participants and is suitable for wider participation.    gathering – used for publicly available metadata, such as that gathered by  search engines on the web. This is the lowest cost option for the data providers, because no additional effort is required.    semantic mapping – the repurposing of metadata for use in different  contexts.  The proliferation of metadata standards developed by different, and often overlapping, communities of interest means that there is a significant danger of not being able to exchange metadata. With interoperability in mind there are two sets of opposing pressures on metadata communities. The first is to simplify  the  standards  as  much  as  possible  to  ensure  that  the  widest community can use the standard with minimum effort. This approach has been adopted by Dublin Core Metadata Initiative. Extensions and refinements are supported by this approach, while maintaining the integrity of a core set of data elements. The second pressure is to make the metadata standard sophisticated  enough  to  encompass  the  full  range  of  data-handling requirements that are likely to be required. This is particularly applicable where  the  metadata  is  not  only  used  for  resource  discovery,  but  also  to   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 173  MANAGING METADATA  173  manage the resource and to process transactions connected with the data entities  being  described.  The  ONIX  standard  and  MARC  21  are  good examples  of  this  more  comprehensive  approach  to  defining  metadata elements.  Management issues Use  of  metadata  to  enable  interoperability  brings  up  a  number  of management issues:    content standards   suppliers’ interests versus customers’ interests   cost versus functionality.  Content standards In order to exchange data there has to be a commonly recognised format for describing that data, a metadata standard. These standards cover not only what data is expressed but also how that data is expressed. For instance, an information resource may have a date field associated with it. An example would be the date that a recording was made. An agreement on how date is expressed would be needed between two applications, even if their internal date representations were different. Frameworks such as Dublin Core suggest encoding schemes, but they are not mandatory, and it is important that this is made explicit in the data itself. Using different date conventions is not of itself a problem, so long as the convention is explicit and there is a way of converting  from  one  format  into  another.  In  a  wider  context,  content standards  need  to  be  agreed  between  metadata  systems  so  that  like  is compared with like and so that the content is interpreted in the appropriate way.  Suppliers’ interests versus customers’ interests Some would suggest that it is in the suppliers’ interests to keep their systems proprietary,  so  that  their  customers  remain  dependent  on  their  systems. Suppliers are also able to develop unique features and ways of handling data and transactions that set them apart from their competitors. Users, on the other hand, want the widest choice and interchangeability of systems. Once they have opted for a particular system, they want the reassurance of knowing that  they  can  transfer  their  data  to  a  new  system.  They  also  want  to  be confident in selecting a system that allows them to continue to interact with   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 174  174 PART III MANAGING METADATA  other applications. The interests of suppliers sometimes conflict with those of their customers.  Defined metadata standards make it possible for customers to exercise choice, by either providing a common language for output from the old system  and for import to the new system , or by defining the data format used by both systems. The downside of premature adoption of a standard is that it effectively creates a bias towards one system and stops development in other areas.   Cost versus functionality In a paper on the role of standards in interoperability the authors suggested that increasing the functionality of a standard increases the cost of acceptance and reduces the number of adopters  Arms et al., 2002 . A similar relationship can be drawn between the functionality of a text mark-up system and the cost of acceptance.   One of the reasons for the widespread use of Dublin Core as the basis for application profiles is its simplicity and ease of comprehension. However, its permissiveness can limit the benefits of exchange of metadata and often does not deliver sufficient benefit for its use to be justified. This is why many internet resources are not formally meta-tagged. The benefit of an increased rate of transaction processing due to interoperable systems can be one factor that stimulates the development of highly functional metadata standards.   Normalising data With  the  proliferation  of  resource  discovery  services  and  collections  of metadata, consistency of metadata has become a major issue. One response to this is to normalise metadata from different sources. This means that it will be necessary to use the least specific data available. Although there is a loss of precision, this is compensated for by the wider range of potential sources that can be called upon.   A second approach is to require everyone to adhere to the same standard. This makes sense in communities that have very specific requirements and where there are benefits to be gained from the additional effort required. However, this approach is not appropriate for a heterogeneous community where  requirements  and  purposes  may  differ  quite  radically.  Importing metadata from other repositories does raise a number of issues. The iLumina project  McClelland et al., 2002  identified the following issues:    Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 175  MANAGING METADATA  175    Missing elements – There is no control over the quality of external data  and if critical data is missing from a data element this can affect the interoperability of the resulting service.    Reconciling values from different vocabularies – If two data providers use  different thesauri for subject terms, this will affect retrieval. Use of different encoding schemes for structured data such as dates can cause ambiguities and errors unless there is a way of declaring the encoding scheme and for translating between different schemes.    Lack of conventions for using or altering external metadata – It is not always  clear whether permission is given to re-use someone else’s metadata.   Different field sizes – If the imported data field size is larger than the  maximum for the repository it is being imported to there will be problems of data integrity and this could cause errors to be reported.    Inaccurate data – This again relates to the fact that there is no control over  metadata that originates externally.  Some of these issues are addressed in well developed markets for exchange of metadata and where there are widely accepted standards. For bibliographic records  there  is  a  well  established  market  and  reputable  suppliers  that provide good-quality data. Even so, there can be variations in the level of cataloguing undertaken. In other fields it will be necessary to work with some sample data to establish the feasibility of importing it and to assess its quality and suitability before undertaking a full-scale import project.  Crosswalks Reconciling metadata created in different environments is a major challenge and some effort has been devoted to mapping equivalent metadata elements between different metadata schemas. These mappings can be displayed as tables and are known as crosswalks. They can be used within systems to effect transformations  between  metadata  objects.  In  the  area  of  bibliographic standards, BIBFRAME provides a model for bibliographic data that can help with the creation of crosswalks between schemes. Crosswalks have been published between Dublin Core and other major metadata schemas such as MODS. Table 11.1 over the page shows an extract from a Dublin Core to MODS crosswalk  Library of Congress, 2012 .  More  complex  transformations  can  be  achieved  by  use  of  a  central metadata schema for interchange between different schemas. This is similar to the idea of a key language for translations between many languages. The advantage of this approach is that there are fewer transformations necessary to cover the whole range of possibilities.

This can be expressed by the formula y = x x-1 , where y is the number of possible connections  translations  and x is the number of different schemas in operation. This number  rapidly  escalates  as  the  number  of  schemas  increases.  In  a  star configuration, on the other hand, there are x-1 transformations or crosswalks  i.e. y = x-1 . The disadvantage is that except for the key schema in the centre any crosswalk between two schemas will require two steps rather than one.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 177  MANAGING METADATA  177  It will be necessary to have a crosswalk to the key schema in the middle and then another crosswalk from the key schema to the destination.  Figure 11.3 shows the possible crosswalks between four schemas using a key schema compared with direct crosswalks between schemas. There is a total of eight possible crosswalks between four schemas in the star configuration  with  a  key  schema  in  the  centre   compared  with  12  possible  direct unidirectional connections. As crosswalks are directional, each edge in these diagrams  represents  two  crosswalks   one  in  either  direction .  The  star configuration shows a slight advantage in the number of crosswalks, offset by the fact that each schema conversion is a two-step process: a crosswalk to the key schema and then a crosswalk to the destination schema. By contrast Figure 11.4 demonstrates a significant advantage with 20 possible crosswalks via a key schema compared with 180 possible direct crosswalks between 10 schemas. The J. Paul Getty Trust adopts a variation of the star configuration using its own metadata standard, Categories for the Description of Works of Art   CDWA ,  as  the  reference  or  key  schema  in  the  first  column  of  the crosswalk  table.  The  crosswalk  compares  data  elements  from  12  other  Figure 11.3 Possible crosswalks between four schemas  Figure 11.4 Possible crosswalks between ten schemas   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 178  178 PART III MANAGING METADATA  metadata standards with those from CDWA  Harpring, 2014 .  Initiatives such as the Data Catalog vocabulary  DCAT  are intended to ‘facilitate interoperability of data catalogues published on the web’  W3C, 2014a . It provides a data model with data elements from Dublin Core Terms  DCMI  Usage  Board,  2012 ,  FOAF   Brickley  and  Miller,  2014   and  SKOS  Miles and Bechhofer, 2009  to describe different aspects of data sets  see Figure 11.5 . Crosswalks were a popular approach in the late 1990s and early 2000s. A  Figure 11.5  Data Catalog Vocabulary Data Model   2014 World Wide Web Consortium   MIT, ERCIM, Keio, Beihang   number of projects created crosswalks between popular metadata standards. A crosswalk maps data elements from one metadata schema to another. It is directional because in many  probably the majority of  instances there is not a one-to-one mapping of all data elements. In some cases there may not be an equivalent metadata element  e.g. the PREMIS ‘preservationLevel’ data elements  have  no  equivalent  in  Dublin  Core .  In  other  instances  the destination may be ambiguous  e.g. Title in DC could map to one or any of bf:WorkTitle,  bf:InstanceTitle,  or  bf:VariantTitle .  Going  in  the  reverse direction  BIBFRAME to DC  means a loss of information, as the DC.title data element is less specific than the source BIBFRAME metadata. Some metadata standards also specify the vocabulary that is used to populate a particular field.  Even  if  they  do  not,  it  may  be  necessary  to  translate  between   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 179  MANAGING METADATA  179  vocabularies. For instance, a bibliographic record from a library that uses Library of Congress Classification may have to be translated into another classification coding system used by the destination library such as Dewey Decimal Classification. So, for example, Yuval Noah Harari’s book History of Tomorrow is classified in LC as CB428, which breaks down into ‘History of  Civilization.  Modern  era.  1971-.  General  Works’.  Using  Dewey,  it  is allocated the code 909.83 – ‘World History’. In other words CB428 in Library of Congress is equivalent to 909 in Dewey Decimal Classification. There may also be differences in cataloguing standards which will lead to differences in the content of fields in the two schemas. So, for instance, the item-by-item cataloguing  approach  used  for  MARC  breaks  down  in  a  BIBFRAME environment, where cataloguing may take place at the work or instance level: bf:WorkTitle, or bf:InstanceTitle.   Metadata registries Metadata  registries  provide  a  resource  where  metadata  definitions  and specifications can be stored and maintained. Many of them conform to the ISO IEC 11179 model of metadata registries  ISO IEC, 2015 . They may be domain-specific or may be maintained by a public authority. A good example is the METeOR Metadata Online Registry  Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2017 . This contains data models used by national health, safety and welfare agencies and authorities in Australia. Another example is the EPA’s System of Registers  US Environmental Protection Agency, 2017 , which lists the data standards, data elements and vocabularies used by the EPA. The Open Metadata Registry  formerly the NSDL Registry  supports metadata interoperability by providing access to details of 420 vocabularies and 158 element sets  at the time of writing  that have been entered by members of the registry  Metadata Management Associates, 2017 . DataCite metadata  described in Chapter 13  is accessed via individual research repositories. Details of the repositories can be viewed via the re3data.org website – the registry of research data repositories.   Quality considerations Quality management The  quality  management  process  ensures  that  the  metadata  is  consistent, accurate and complete. There are many measures of information quality that can be applied to metadata. The concept of quality can be applied to the content of metadata elements as well as to the administrative metadata. The emphasis   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 180  180 PART III MANAGING METADATA  tends to be on quality management as a process, which applies throughout the lifecycle of information rather than being checked at an end point.   Quality of the metadata content The quality of the metadata content follows some of the same principles as the quality of information itself. In Chapter 2 we saw how schemas can be used to determine whether metadata content is in the right form to conform with the standard. The consistency of the metadata, not only with itself but also between resources, is important if retrieval is to be consistent and reliable. For instance, the use of an encoding scheme will help to ensure that the contents of a particular field or data element are comparable across a resource or  collection  of  information.  Clearly  an  encoding  scheme  is  in  itself  not sufficient to assure the quality of metadata. The skill of the indexer will also have  an  effect  on  the  overall  quality  and  therefore  effectiveness  of  the metadata for retrieval purposes.  Administrative metadata Administrative metadata shows when the metadata was created or updated and its origin. Its purpose is to provide a means of managing metadata  as opposed to the resources described by the metadata . In the early 2000s the Dublin  Core  community  recognised  the  need  for  metadata  to  describe metadata,  to  facilitate  interoperability  and  exchange  of  metadata.  This culminated in a specialised data element set  Hansen and Andresen, 2003 . It defines the data elements, which are grouped in the following categories:    metadata for the entire records  such as identifier, scope, language    metadata for update and change  based on activity    metadata for batch interchange of records  such as filename, technical  format, address of result file .  A useful model of administrative metadata is the A-Core Model  Figure 11.6  which  describes  the  relationship  between  what  is  now  known  as administrative metadata and content metadata  Iannella and Campbell, 1999 .  Resource  describes  describes  Content Metadata  A-Core Metadata  Figure 11.6 A-Core Model   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 181  MANAGING METADATA  181  Although this original Internet-Draft has not been updated, many of the ideas in this paper have been carried forward in the Dublin Core DCMI Administrative Metadata, described earlier. The A-Core Elements are divided into four components:  1 Who, what, when? 2 Validity dates. 3 Metadata location. 4 Rights ownership.  The  provenance  of  metadata  is  an  important  aspect  of  quality.  The provenance of the metadata is intended to answer the following questions: Who created the metadata? When was it created or amended? What were the circumstances that led to the creation of the metadata? Chapter 8 discussed metadata as an information object, for which the provenance can be recorded as part of preservation management.   Metadata security Security is a major consideration in an interoperable environment. A useful analysis by the New Zealand government suggests that security is a key issue  New Zealand E-Government Unit, 2001 :    to guarantee integrity of data   to make data manageable by grouping by agency or user   to prevent alteration of data by other agencies   to control access to system functions.  At a basic level a security strategy for metadata will need to ensure that the metadata  maintains  its  physical  integrity,  by  being  stored  securely  on  a system with regular back-ups. The storage medium will be subject to all the same  considerations  that  would  apply  to  any  kind  of  electronic  data: robustness  of  the  storage  medium,  corruption  of  data  by  decay  of  the medium,  storage  conditions  for  the  medium,  durability  of  the  medium, technology used to read the medium. A strategy for back-up and migration of the metadata will go some way towards addressing these concerns.  It will be necessary to restrict editorial access to metadata to authorised personnel. The access is usually controlled by the operating system. At a crude level  it  can  be  used  to  allow  only  certain  people  access  to  the  metadata management  application.  For  example,  different  levels  of  access  might include:   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 182  182 PART III MANAGING METADATA    Read – The user can view metadata and print it off. In some cases this will extend to the issue of whether or not the user even knows that the record exists.    Create – The user can create new metadata records.   Edit – The user can amend or edit existing records – normally the date of any changes and the name of the person making the change is recorded.    Delete – The user can remove a record from the system – although an  audit trail should  indicate that this has been done.  The levels of access can be fine-tuned so that individual records or even data elements  may  have  their  own  security  levels.  Users  are  then  assigned  a security authorisation that allows them appropriate access to records or data elements. These measures depend on the ability to identify individual users and to control their access to the system. Most commonly a user’s identity and password provides a basic level of security. More sophisticated systems may require some kind of physical verification such as a key. This may be an electronic key such as a swipe card, or could be based on a physical attribute of the user such as a finger-print or iris image.  Another aspect of security is data privacy. If the metadata is being stored as a back-up on a removable medium for instance, or being transmitted from one location to another over the internet, it may be necessary to encrypt it. There has been a lot of discussion about the balance between national security and privacy in light of the extensive use of communications metadata by bodies such as the US National Security Agency  Solove, 2011; Morrison, 2014; Greenwald, 2013 . Metadata itself needs to be kept securely as well as playing a part in the security of the data that it describes. Skinner, Han and Chang  2005  introduced the concept of ‘meta privacy’ to deal with the issue of protecting metadata, as distinct from using metadata to protect data. They talk about meta privacy in terms of benefits and risks associated with secure metadata. They advocate the use of privacy tags that are attached to metadata elements, which govern access to the contents of that data element.  Conclusion Metadata is an information resource that needs to be managed. A lifecycle approach can be adopted to handle metadata throughout its life. An alternative approach  is  to  view  metadata  creation  as  a  project  and  to  apply  project management principles to it. This means analysing metadata requirements, selecting and developing a schema and then importing metadata. Application profiles  represent  another  option  for  development  of  suitable  metadata standards. The Singapore Framework for the development of application   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 183  MANAGING METADATA  183  profiles encompasses the project approach to metadata management.   Interoperability of metadata is necessary for development of linked data applications. Crosswalks provide powerful ways of converting metadata from one  standard  to  another.  Where  there  are  crosswalks  between  several standards, it may be more efficient to establish a key schema through which all metadata standards are translated. It is just as important to manage the metadata  quality  as  it  is  to  manage  the  accuracy  and  consistency  of  the documents it describes. Security is required to ensure the integrity of the metadata and to protect personal privacy.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 184   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 185  CHAPTER 12  Taxonomies and encoding schemes  Overview This chapter is all about the content of metadata elements. Permissive standards such as Dublin Core describe what each field or data element is for, but do not specify how the content of that data element is generated. For instance, the ‘dc:creator’ data element might contain the name of an organisation as it is known to the website manager, it might be taken from an authority file, or it may be created according to a set of cataloguing rules such as AACR2. This chapter is about the techniques or mechanisms that are used to manage and control the content of individual data elements. This is important for consistency, quality of retrieval and efficiency of operation. Controlled vocabularies, authorities and cataloguing rules all come under the heading of encoding schemes. A more detailed treatment of cataloguing can be found in Welsh and Batley  2012 . The development and use of controlled vocabularies are covered in classic works such as Aitchison, Gilchrist and Bawden  2000  and more recently in Broughton  2006 . Lambe  2007  and Broughton  2015  deal with aspects of classification and taxonomies – also important sources of terms for metadata elements.  Role of taxonomies in metadata Hedden  2016  recognises the convergence of metadata and taxonomies and the richness of software applications to handle taxonomies and ontologies. It is key to managing the content of metadata elements. Lambe  2007  sees metadata as one way of instantiating a taxonomy, the other being a thesaurus. Increasingly taxonomies and controlled vocabularies are being incorporated into document and information management products and services such as   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 186  186 PART III MANAGING METADATA  Sharepoint 2013. White  2016  makes a strong case for the use of taxonomies and controlled vocabularies in an enterprise search environment. Bloggers such as Earley  2017  and the Metadata Research Center  Drexel University, 2017  have also contributed to discussion about metadata and taxonomies.  Encoding and maintenance of controlled vocabularies One of the strengths of metadata schemas such as Dublin Core is that it provides a means of comparing the content of data elements for different resources. Each element has a defined meaning, so that there is a semantic relationship. This means, for instance, that the Creator data element will contain information about the person, group or organisation responsible for creating  the  resource.  This  provides  a  mechanism  for  implementing  the semantic web, where like can be compared with like. However, unless there is some agreement about how that data is expressed, the benefits are limited. This can relate to fundamental attributes of data such as what language it is expressed in. The following marked-up text indicates that the content of the data elements is in English  of the British variety :      <meta  name=‘DC.Subject’  xml:lang=‘en-gb’  scheme=‘LAMS-CCS’ content=‘Home  ownership’   >  In the case of subject retrieval an indexer may have to select terms from a controlled vocabulary such as a thesaurus or from classes in a classification scheme  or  taxonomy.  This  is  especially  important  when  dealing  with  a structured  collection  of  material  where  it  is  necessary  to  reliably  and consistently retrieve relevant material according to search criteria established at the point of need. Using a controlled vocabulary ensures more consistent retrieval. This limits the searcher to a preferred term choice rather than having to think of what synonyms might describe the concept being searched for. In records  management  systems  a  file  plan  provides  a  similar  mechanism, allowing users to select files according to a designated category which may be subject-based or based on a functional analysis. The selection of terms or categories can be presented as drop-down lists, as searchable databases, or as  navigable  networks  of  terms.  Many  specialist  organisations  have developed their own thesauri tailored to their needs. This approach has also extended to EDRM  electric document and records management  systems, where subject retrieval is a key consideration. A thesaurus allows a range of relationships between terms to be included. A full treatment of thesaurus   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 187  TAXONOMIES AND ENCODING SCHEMES  187  development  can  be  found  in  Thesaurus  Construction  and  Use  Aitchison, Gilchrist and Bawden, 2000  and Essential Thesaurus Construction  Broughton, 2006 . Some aspects of thesaurus construction and use are also covered in ISO 25964-1  ISO, 2011 . Lists of specialist thesauri and taxonomies can provide a good resource for identifying a controlled vocabulary to adopt for specific metadata  fields,  or  they  can  provide  a  source  of  terms  for  a  tailored vocabulary   Taxonomy  Warehouse,  2017;  Basel  University  Library,  2017; University of Toronto Library, 2015 . If a controlled vocabulary is necessary  sometimes it is not; for instance in free-text titles , there are three options:  1 Adopt external controlled vocabulary – If a similar organisation has  developed its own thesaurus, or there is a thesaurus covering your organisation’s areas of activity, then this may be a cost-effective approach. It saves the effort of generating your own terminology and has the advantage of being in line with at least one other organisation. The disadvantage is that you have no control over the development of the thesaurus and incorporation of new terms.  2 Select pre-existing standards – There are standards for encoding particular types of data such as dates, ISO 8601  ISO, 2004c  and languages, ISO 639- 1  ISO, 2002 . By their nature they are widely adopted, as they tend to reflect a consensus across a wide range of users. This approach tends to work for very specific and clearly delimited areas.  3 Create controlled vocabulary – This is the most ambitious and expensive  option, as it requires an analysis of the subject coverage and functions of the organisation, and considerable effort to compile. It has the advantage of being tailored to the needs of your organisation and of being under your control – so you decide what new terms are added or which are the preferred terms.  There are many tools for developing and maintaining controlled vocabularies such as thesauri and taxonomies. A good starting point is the Thesaurus Software Directory  originally on the WillPower website and now maintained by  Taxobank   and  the  links  to  online  resources  mentioned  in  Heather Hedden’s book The Accidental Taxonomist  Will and TaxoBank, 2013; Hedden, 2016 . Other lists have been produced periodically but have not been kept up to date. There are also professional groups and discussion lists that have an interest in taxonomies or classification schemes, such as the American Society for Information Science and Technology  ASIS&T, 2017 , the Special Libraries Association Taxonomy Division  SLA, 2017  and the International Society for Knowledge Organization  ISKO, 2017 .    Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 188  188 PART III MANAGING METADATA  The ISO 24617 series of standards provides guidance on different types of semantic annotation, including time and events, dialogue acts, semantic roles, discourse structure, special information and semantic relations in discourse  ISO, 2016b . It supports the development of interoperable resources and is the precursor to representation of information using a specific language such as XML. This framework is a modelling system for semantic elements of resources and can therefore be used for developing rules for encoding schemes.  Thesauri and taxonomies Thesauri and controlled vocabularies present a number of opportunities to enhance the quality of retrieval from a document collection:    If the organisation has invested effort in defining a standard vocabulary  or set of terminology, it is possible to enrich metadata with the ‘preferred’ terms from the thesaurus, and to configure the search engine to look for the appropriate metadata.    Indexing can be automated so that documents are processed to identify  potential descriptors. The preferred term is associated with the document as metadata when a recognised synonym is found in the text of the document. This ensures that a consistent term is used to describe a concept regardless of the actual words used. This approach can be enhanced by providing users with a drop-down list or a navigable hierarchy to find suitable ‘preferred’ search terms.    A taxonomy can be used to classify and organise documents in the  collection. The taxonomy may be applied manually or automatically based on recognition of words in the text. The user then has access to the resources by means of a map or drop-down lists of categories under which the documents fall.   Advances in automatic indexing and classification of resources to enhance the metadata have highlighted the need for a framework for evaluating the performance of auto-indexing systems  Golub et al., 2016 .  Synonym rings Many search engines support synonym rings. These can be created from a simplified thesaurus, which associates terms that are synonyms or quasi- synonyms   words  which  have  the  same  meaning  or  similar  or  related meanings . For instance, the following terms could be associated with one another in a synonym ring:    Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 189  TAXONOMIES AND ENCODING SCHEMES  189  Thesaurus relationships Thesaurus relationships are deﬁned in ISO 25964-1  ISO, 2011  and an excellent and detailed description of them is given in Aitchison, Gilchrist and Bawden  2000 . A term may be associated with other terms, deﬁned by relationships. If we take ‘Bacteria’ as our lead in term  Haynes, Huckle and Elliot, 2002  the following relationships can be deﬁned:  Bacteria  BT: Microorganisms BT: Pathogens NT: E coli NT: Legionella NT: Listeria NT: Salmonella  Addiction  BT: Psychiatric disorders RT: Alcohol abuse RT: Drug abuse RT: Smoking RT: Substance abuse  BT – Broader Term. This is a more general term and is higher up the hierarchy. The thesaurus may have several levels of hierarchy – which can provide a useful navigation tool. In this example ‘Bacteria’ has two Broader Terms, ‘Microorganisms’ and ‘Pathogens’. NT – Narrower Term. A more speciﬁc term, lower down the hierarchy. A term may have more than one narrower term. The inverse relationship is a broader term. The narrower terms of ‘Bacteria’ are: ‘E Coli’, ‘Legionella’, ‘Listeria’ and ‘Salmonella’.  The next relationship is illustrated by the example of ‘Addiction’ from the HSE Thesaurus  Haynes, Huckle and Elliot, 2002 .  RT – related term. This is for terms that are associated with the term in question. This is a useful way of broadening the search or providing a route to alternative search terms  or indexing terms . This feature can be particularly helpful for generating drop- down lists of alternative search terms. In this example entering ‘Addiction’ would produce a drop-down list of alternative search terms including ‘Alcohol abuse’, ‘Drug abuse’, ‘Smoking’ and ‘Substance abuse’.  The ﬁnal use and use for relationship is illustrated with the following example:  Personnel managers  UF: Human resources managers UF: Industrial relations managers UF: Training managers BT: Functional managers  USE – preferred term. This points to the preferred term. A thesaurus represents a ‘controlled vocabulary’ to ensure consistency of indexing  and retrieval . The entry for Training managers in the thesaurus would have the USE ‘Personnel managers’ as its entry. UF – Use For, i.e. non preferred term. This points to synonyms of a preferred term. In this example ‘Personnel managers’ is the preferred term and the UF relationships point to the non-preferred terms that would be synonyms.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 190  190 PART III MANAGING METADATA  Personnel managers, Human resources managers, Industrial relations managers, Training managers.  Another example of a synonym ring groups together related terms from a thesaurus:  Addiction, Alcohol abuse, Drug abuse, Smoking, Substance abuse.  In a structured thesaurus, these terms would be related to one another with the following relationships:  USE USE FOR RT  related term  NT  narrower term   A  search  for  any  one  of  these  terms  would  retrieve  all  the  terms  in  the synonym ring. This improves recall at the expense of precision. Precision can be improved by being more selective in the relationships included in the synonym ring – for example by limiting the synonym ring to true synonyms, defined by the USE and USE FOR relationships. An alternative approach is to  be  more  inclusive   by  using  quasi-synonyms  defined  by  RT  and  NT relationships as well as USE and USE FOR , but to generate drop-down lists in response to queries and allowing users to explicitly select related terms.   Role of controlled vocabularies A thesaurus is a representation of knowledge, the relationships between terms reflecting assumptions about the nature of a subject or discipline.  The terms ‘taxonomy’, ‘thesaurus’ and ‘classification’ are sometimes used interchangeably. However, it is useful to make distinctions between these terms. A thesaurus is normally made up of terms  words or phrases  which represent single concepts. These terms are classified for ease of management and may be displayed as a hierarchy or as an alphabetic list. Taxonomies and classification systems are ways of organising or grouping entities, whether they be species of insects, document collections, web pages on a domain or ideas about a subject. Each category in a taxonomy may be a complex concept made  up  of  simpler  concepts,  or  it  may  be  a  class  of  objects  used  for discriminating between objects.  In indexing theory there is a distinction made between pre-coordinate and post-coordinate indexes. A pre-coordinate index puts simple terms together to produce a category or term that can be used for searching. For example,   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 191  TAXONOMIES AND ENCODING SCHEMES  191  an index in a recipe book may be organised by dishes, e.g. Carrot cake, which would be a pre-coordinated index term. In contrast, a searchable database of recipes may have an index term ‘Carrots’ and a separate term for ‘Cakes’. This is  a  post-coordinate  system,  because  the  terms  are  put  together   or coordinated  at the search stage rather than the indexing stage.  Content rules – authority files When applying metadata, consistency is important. The metadata may be applied manually or may be partially automated  based on recognition of synonyms in the text  and it may be embedded in the resource or kept in a separate database or repository. Not all elements can be populated from a limited,  controlled  list  of  terms.  For  instance,  personal  names,  company names and addresses are all variable, but still need to be quoted consistently. A set of cataloguing rules or conventions can help to ensure that a particular name appears in a consistent form and that users  knowing the cataloguing conventions   can  easily  find  appropriate  entries.  Of  course  libraries  use authority  lists  for  standard  forms  of  names  or  construct  them  using cataloguing rules such as RDA or ISAD G .  It is easy to see the difficulties that arise if there is no established convention for expressing names. For example, Jane E. Smith could be expressed as Dr Smith; Smith, Jane; Smith, J.; Smith, Jane E. etc. Each alternative will affect retrieval. The authority file extract from the Library of Congress  see Figure 12.1 on the next page  also would have difficulty distinguishing between authors where Smith, J. is used. Even being as specific as ‘Jane E Smith’ produces some ambiguous results.   If the data is to be processed automatically, the parts of the name and the order in which they appear can be critical. Comparison of two items becomes difficult if different conventions are used to generate identifying metadata such as ‘author name’.   As well as being a source of metadata content  e.g. name authorities for authors , authority files are themselves structured and defined by metadata standards. The Functional Requirements for Authority Data  FRAD  provides a data model for authorities such as the Name authority file maintained by the  Library  of  Congress   IFLA,  2013 .  Other  standards  such  as  Resource Description and Access  RDA  also incorporate this model. Figure 12.2 shows the relationship between bibliographic entities  such as books  which are known by identifiers such as ISBNs or by Names such as author names. This forms  the  basis  for  an  author  index   controlled  access  point   or  a  Name authority file. This is governed by Rules  such as RDA  which are applied by an Agency, such as the Library of Congress.

Some systems, such as EDRM systems, may depend on users creating some metadata, combined with metadata derived automatically from the system. For instance, when a new electronic file or record is created, the responsible person may have to select a category for that file from the file plan or classification scheme. That person will probably also create a title and may add keywords to enrich the indexing of the file so that others can find it in the future. Some information, such as the date the file was opened; the name of the person opening it and the department, would be generated automatically by the system.  Some systems allow for automatic generation of metadata. So, for instance, the text can be processed to select appropriate keywords from a controlled vocabulary, which is presented to searchers when they want to identify and retrieve a file. Figure 12.3 illustrates the way in which natural language terms are associated with controlled terms from a thesaurus. These can be used in a search interface to retrieve all synonyms or they can be used to enrich the metadata associated with the document to ensure reliable retrieval.

For certain technical information  such  as  format  data  associated  with  images,  for  instance, automatic capture of embedded metadata is widely used. Manual indexing is expensive, and it is not always possible to make this level of investment. Alternatives such as latent semantic indexing and automatic analysis of text to construct indexes are offered by some search engines as an alternative to human intervention.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 194  194 PART III MANAGING METADATA  Intelligent searching systems that ‘learn’ users’ information requirements provide another route to accurate and comprehensive retrieval of relevant material. This is an alternative to the use of metadata to describe a resource and works well where individual needs are constant and the sources being searched are very diverse  as on the internet .  Digital resources with embedded metadata facilitate local management as well as transfer of those resources between different repositories. Networks of repositories working in co-operation can develop sophisticated back-up, migration and storage strategies to ensure that secure copies of the images are maintained while keeping storage requirements to a minimum.  Ontologies There is some discussion about the difference between ontologies and other types of classification system. ‘An ontology is a set of precise descriptive statements about some part of the world  usually referred to as the domain of interest or the subject matter of the ontology ’  W3C, 2012 . Gruber talks about ontologies in the following terms:   In the context of database systems, ontology can be viewed as a level of abstraction of data models, analogous to hierarchical and relational models, but intended for modeling knowledge about individuals, their attributes, and their relationships to other individuals.   Gruber, 2009   In other words, an ontology is a way of modelling reality and as such is a knowledge representation.   McGuinness  2002  describes three universal properties of all ontologies:  i  a finite controlled vocabulary,  ii  unambiguous interpretation of classes and  term  relationships;  and   iii   strict  hierarchical  subclass  relationships between classes. In effect an ontology takes the form of a specialist type of classification system or taxonomy. McGuinness goes on to describe uses of ontologies and in particular their application in a web environment. These range from a source of controlled vocabulary, to a way of organising content, to improvement of navigation, browsing and retrieval capabilities. More complex ontologies can be used for modelling data. Lambe  2007, 238  also talks about ontologies in terms of concepts and the relationship between them:  Concept A – Relationship – Concept B   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 195  TAXONOMIES AND ENCODING SCHEMES  195  This means that they can be expressed as RDF triples. They are designed for processing on computers and allow for the creation of new relationships based on existing relationships and inferences that can be drawn from them. Corcho, Poveda-Villalón and Gómez-Pérez  2015  talk about ‘lightweight’ and ‘heavyweight’ ontologies. Ontologies contain concepts and the relationships between  them.  In  these  terms  a  thesaurus  would  count  as  a  lightweight ontology. However, a heavyweight ontology would contain more complex relationships than those typically found in a thesaurus. They would also contain axioms that enable applications to define new relationships. This has proven useful in specific areas of research such as genetics.  OWL  Web Ontology Language  OWL   Web  Ontology  Language   was  developed  specifically  to  handle concepts and the relationships between them  OWL Working Group, 2012 . OWL is described in the following terms:  OWL is a computational logic-based language such that knowledge expressed in OWL can be reasoned with by computer programs either to verify the consistency of that knowledge or to make implicit knowledge explicit. OWL documents, known as ontologies, can be published in the World Wide Web and may refer to or be referred from other OWL ontologies.   OWL Working Group, 2012   It is now in its second release, OWL 2, and has the following features  W3C, 2012 :    axioms – the basic statements that an OWL ontology expresses   entities – elements used to refer to real-world objects   expressions – combinations of entities to form complex descriptions from  basic ones.  An axiom might be: ‘books have a publication date’. An entity might be: ‘The Hitch-hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy is a book’. An expression might be: ‘therefore the book The Hitch-hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy has a publication date’.  Some general-purpose ontologies have been developed, such as FOAF  Friend of a Friend  for representing connections in social networks and on the web more generally  Brickley and Miller, 2014 . Another example is SKOS  Simple Knowledge Organization System , which describes the structure and content   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 196  196 PART III MANAGING METADATA  of  topics,  controlled  vocabularies,  classification  schemes,  taxonomies  and folksonomies  Miles and Bechhofer, 2009 . SKOS is an OWL ontology and SKOS vocabularies are instances of the ontology. Examples of vocabularies  data sets  listed on the SKOS website include: Unesco thesaurus, Agrovoc Agricultural thesaurus, VIAF Person Authorities  from the Virtual International Authority File , and Language Codes based on ISO639  W3C, 2015 .   Schema.org Schema.org is an ontology system based on semantic web technology with controlled vocabularies for digital objects such as web pages, digital sound recordings, images and electronic publications  Sponsors of Schema.org, 2017 . Schema.org metadata can be expressed in RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD. It is widely used by search engines and is the result of a collaborative effort by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo! and Yandex. The vocabularies have been developed by an open community process and are continually developing. Schema.org can  be  extended  either  as  a  hosted  extension   reviewed  and  managed  by schema.org , or as an external extension  managed by other groups . In effect schema.org allows for tagging of content using a common vocabulary for entities,  relationships  and  actions.  Schema.org  contains  589  types,  860 properties and 114 enumeration values. Commonly used item types include:    Creative works: CreativeWork, Book, Movie, MusicRecording, Recipe,  TVSeries . . .    Embedded non-text objects: AudioObject, ImageObject, VideoObject   Event   Organisation   Person   Place, LocalBusiness, Restaurant . . .   Product, Offer, AggregateOffer   Review, AggregateRating.  The schema.org website uses the film Avatar to demonstrate how the mark- up works  Sponsors of Schema.org, 2017 . It declares Avatar to be item type ‘Movie’  expressed using Microdata tags in HTML 5 :     Avatar   Director:  James  Cameron   born  August  16,  1954    Science  fiction   Trailer      Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 197  TAXONOMIES AND ENCODING SCHEMES  197  Schema.org can be used to specify the properties associated with the item:     Avatar   Director:   James  Cameron   born  August  16,  1954    Science  fiction  <a  href=‘.. movies avatar-theatrical-trailer.html’ itemprop=‘trailer’>Trailer     Schema.org vocabularies are used by the main search engines to improve the relevance  of  search  result  rankings.  Tagged  content  using  Schema.org vocabularies and mark-up enables users to search in context and obtain more precise search results. For instance, Google uses content that is tagged using the Schema.org vocabularies  as well as other vocabularies  to populate its Knowledge Graph database  Singhal, 2012 . It provides factual answers to queries without having to go to the external websites themselves.  For instance, a museum could tag its home page as a museum, which is listed as Thing-Place in Schema.org. A search on google.co.uk yields at the top of the search results the result in Figure 12.4.  Figure 12.4 Google Knowledge Graph results   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 198  198 PART III MANAGING METADATA  Clicking on ‘The British Museum’ then shows structured data derived from the  schema.org  metadata  for  that  museum,  without  having  to  go  to  the museum’s website  Figure 12.5 .  Figure 12.5 Structured data in Google about the British Museum   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 199  TAXONOMIES AND ENCODING SCHEMES  199  Social tagging and folksonomies Social media applications encourage active participation by users in a number of  ways:  creating  content;  uploading  images;  sharing  reports  on  activity; connecting to other people; commenting on posts by other people; and pro - viding emotional support through the ‘like’ feature. In many social networking environments, users are also left to their own devices when it comes to tagging content  or  providing  descriptions.  This  has  led,  especially  in  the  image exchange communities such as Instagram and Flickr, to the emergence of ‘folk - sonomies’. The consolidated collective effort of users is viewed as an enterprise to make content accessible. This is particularly the case for images with no text associated with them. This means that free-text  or natural language  searching is not available to users. The problem is that there is minimal co-ordination – users do have access to lists of tags used by previous users, but the resulting vocabulary is so large and uncontrolled that it is difficult in practice to navigate effectively to find the appropriate term s  or subject headings.  Self-indexing is also a feature of institutional repositories, where many institutions require authors to index papers that they have submitted to the repository. Rarely are they skilled indexers and very often there is very little interest or motivation to spend much time on what might be regarded as a chore. Some suggestions have been made for the development of automated indexing approaches combined with a folksonomy approach. However, there has to be a tested framework for evaluating the performance of such systems against the alternatives  controlled language or self-tagging exclusively  – Matthews et al.  2010 ; Golub et al.  2016 .  Measures of tag weighting Syn and Spring  2013  have created two measures for tagging that are intended to help managers of metadata collections to assess the quality of social tagging:   Annotation Dominance  AD . This considers the number of times a particular tag is applied to a resource relative to the total number of users who have used tags. This is a measure of the level of consensus or agreement about the application of a particular tag to a speciﬁc resource. For example, a photograph on a social media site might have the tag ‘sunset’. The AD measure would be an indication of the proportion of taggers that have used the tag ‘sunset’ for that particular picture. The value of AD will be between 0 and 1.  AD =   Count  T  Ai  Count  U,R j  ,R j       Here, the numerator, Count TAi, Rj , indicates the number of tag sets that contains a tag Ai  TAi  assigned to a resource Rj, and the denominator, Count U, Rj , is the number of all users who bookmarked a resource Rj with a tag set. Therefore, AD is a measure of how much a tag is agreed by users to represent a given resource.   Syn and Spring, 2013, 969    Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 200  200 PART III MANAGING METADATA  Cross Resources Annotation Discrimination  CRAD  This is a measure of the usefulness of a tag for discriminating between categories of document. If a tag is used extensively  an extreme case would be applied to every document  it is not useful for discriminating. If a tag is used for only one document, it is also of little use for categorising documents. Where a tag is used more than once  i.e. Count  U, Ai  > 1 :  log      Count  R  Count  R, Ai   log Count  R    CRAD =  When the CRAD and AD values are multiplied together they provide a measure of the degree to which a tag can act ‘as semantic and classiﬁcatory metadata terms’  Syn and Spring, 2013, 971 .  Stock  and  Stock   2013,  611–14   characterise  folksonomies  as  ‘knowledge organisation without rules’. They suggest five ways of improving the quality of social tags, building on previous work on ‘tag gardening’  Stock and Stock, 2013, 621–8; Peters and Weller, 2008 :    Weeding to remove bad tags such as spam, spelling errors and variations on standard spelling  e.g. standardising on the US spelling ‘sulfur’ or the British spelling ‘sulphur’ and removing errors such as ‘sulpur’ and ‘slufur’. Another example would be deciding whether the preferred term is ‘epinephrine’ or ‘adrenaline’ and automatically re-indexing the non- preferred terms.    Seeding with ‘previously allocated tags’ to ensure that frequently used tags are considered for each new document. For example, WordPress lists previously used tags when a blog author is making a new entry. The size of the tag text indicates which tags have been used most frequently.    Vocabulary control to conflate synonyms and to disambiguate  homographs. For instance, on Mendeley, books about ‘information retrieval’ may have the following tags: ‘IR’; ‘info retrieval’; and ‘information retrieval’. Standardising on one of these is desirable. An image on iStock with the tag ‘plant’ could refer to an industrial facility or a living thing and needs to be disambiguated to make it clear which meaning is intended.    Fertilizing by offering semantically related items to a user. A search on  ‘plant’ also yields results for ‘tree’, ‘flower’ and ‘leaf’ on iStock.    Harvesting to identify and use the most popular tags or ‘power tags’ to  index documents. For instance, catalogue entries for books on LibraryThing display the tags that have been assigned by other users.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 201  TAXONOMIES AND ENCODING SCHEMES  201  The size of the tag text indicates which ones are most popular and thus direct other users to them.   Guy  and  Tonkin   2006   provide  a  useful  overview  of  the  origin  of folksonomies as well as making suggestions to improve the quality of tagging.  Conclusion In order to be useful for retrieval, management or interoperation, not only is there a need for an agreed metadata standard, but also the content of the metadata  elements  needs  to  be  managed.  Encoding  schemes  such  as controlled vocabularies, authority lists and cataloguing rules are all well established methods of achieving this. However, in the era of linked data a more  sophisticated  approach  is  required  to  allow  for  more  complex relationships  between  concepts  and  to  facilitate  the  processing  of  data elements to create new data. The development of languages such as OWL and schema.org provide a mechanism for this and this development has resulted in  the  creation  of  general-purpose  ontologies  such  as  FOAF,  SKOS  and schema.org. A large number of specialist ontologies have also been developed in specific areas such as genetics.  The establishment of the semantic web and the growth of social networks that allow interaction between users and systems have led to the proliferation of  social  tagging  and  the  growth  of  folksonomies.  There  are  emerging approaches for harnessing global tagging to enhance the quality of online data and to apply some level of control and consistency in their use.    Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 202   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 203  CHAPTER 13  Very large data collections  Overview This chapter concentrates on aspects of retrieval and management that are particular to big  data.  This  book  originally  set  out  to  consider  metadata  about  documents  and document collections, using a wide definition of documents to include images, sound, museum objects, broadcast material, as well as text-based resources such as books, journal articles and web pages. Social media activity has been included in this, because it  involves  a  permanent   usually  text-based   record  of  social  interactions  or  online behaviour. The type of metadata associated with each of these types of big data will vary considerably,  as  will  the  use  to  which  it  is  put.  Transactional  data  has  largely  been excluded from this scope, unless those transactions relate to documents. This chapter also describes linked data, an approach that expands the scope of data sets enormously, because it provides a mechanism for combining data sets from different repositories or collections – mediated by the internet.  The move towards big data The  move  toward  big  data  has  been  driven  by  increasing  storage  and processing capacity, the establishment of standards for exchange of data and the requirement of funders to make research data more widely available. This last factor is based on the idea that publicly funded researchers should make their data available for further exploitation. It is also driven by regulatory factors such as those that apply to the pharmaceutical industry. Criticism of clinical trials data focuses on the selective nature of publication, with the tendency for some pharmaceutical research companies to publish only data   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 204  204 PART III MANAGING METADATA  that  favours  their  products,  the  phenomenon  of  ‘missing  trials  data’ documented  by  Ben  Goldacre   2013   in  his  book  Bad  Pharma.  The  US government  now  requires  all  clinical  trials  to  be  registered  according  to Section 801 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendment Act, which came into force in 2017. The registration includes details of documents and data sets arising from the clinical trial including:  Type Definition: The type of data set or document being shared.   Individual Participant Data Set   Study Protocol   Statistical Analysis Plan   Informed Consent Form   Clinical Study Report   Analytic Code   Other  specify   URL  Definition: The Web address used to request or access the data set or document.   Identifier  Definition: The unique identifier used by a data repository for the data set or document.   Comments  Definition: Additional information including the name of the data repository or other location where the data set or document is available. Provide any additional explanations about the data set or document and instructions for obtaining access, particularly if a URL is not provided.    US National Institutes of Health, 2017   There has been a great deal of commentary about the growth of big data  Mayer-Schönberger and Cukier, 2013; Davenport, 2014; Kitchin, 2014 . It encompasses many different areas and includes transactional data, research data  collections,  unstructured  data  in  an  organisational  context   mostly documents , as well as large bibliographic collections. Each of these areas has its own challenges of complexity, volume and quality. Metadata provides an important means for accessing information in big data collections, and it needs to be managed to do so effectively. The metadata status will depend to a great extent on the nature of the ‘big data’ being interrogated. Metadata is also  needed  to  manage  large  data  collections.  Some  aspects  such  as preservation, rights management and retrieval are covered in earlier chapters.    Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 205  VERY LARGE DATA COLLECTIONS  205  What is big data? The ability to gather and store large volumes of data cheaply has led to an industry devoted to exploitation of large data sets. Data mining is based on querying  large  data  sets,  sometimes  unstructured,  sometimes  very heterogeneous, to extract new insights and to develop appropriate business strategies. It tended to focus on transactional data such as customer purchases and stock levels in retail outlets. The technology has also been more recently applied to large text collections to discover patterns that would not otherwise be evident. However, some of the statistical techniques developed by Shannon  Shannon and Weaver, 1949  and colleagues are precursors to current text mining techniques  Bholat et al., 2015 .   What is ‘big data’? Davenport  2014, 6–9  talks about ‘big data’ in terms of volume,  variety  and  velocity.  The  volume  is  self-evident;  it  must  be  a substantial collection of data. However, even this aspect can cause problems because there is no universal agreement about what a large- or high-volume collection is. The variety refers to the range of data types that may constitute a ‘big data’ agglomeration. The data may be unstructured – such as text documents held in a document records management system – or it may come from a variety of sources with different data structures. These may be internal databases  or  data  silos,  or  may  be  made  up  of  data  from  different organisations. The semantic web is based on the creation of links between these disparate sources. The third attribute of big data is velocity: is it a rapidly changing data set – such as social media postings for instance, or transactional data generated in a shop or an online retailer? If the data under consideration fulfils these three criteria  and sometimes only two , it can be considered  to  be  ‘big  data’.  There  is  also  something  about  purpose  that characterises some ‘big data’ collections. Very often they are spoken about in terms  of  analysis  beyond  the  original  purpose  of  the  data.  For  instance, documents generated within an office environment may have a number of different  purposes:  to  document  business  decisions;  to  make  a  record  of transactions for accounting purposes; or to market a product to customers. These documents may be aggregated into a data set and analysed using sentiment analysis, or to spot up-coming issues, or to mine for new ideas to improve profitability. Perhaps just by making big data available it is possible to generate new applications and potential solutions.  Some of the data  or some parts of the data collection  in a repository may be structured as a database, in which case identifying the relevant metadata is more straightforward. The data dictionary or field definitions provide the metadata structure for the data set. If the data is unstructured, metadata may have to be created or automatically generated  or extracted  from the data collection. Metadata can be applied to collections, to individual digital objects   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 206  206 PART III MANAGING METADATA   or documents , and to metadata itself. As more and more organisations are migrating information repositories to the cloud there are opportunities to break down silos and offer access to a broad range of data via a common interface. Text and data mining techniques have been promoted as one of the benefits of cloud services, alongside resilience, accessibility and cost savings. However,  they  also  introduce  a  level  of  complexity  and  the  need  for description of resources. At the time of writing there do not appear to be any established metadata standards for describing content held on cloud services, although services such as Cloud Foundry do suggest metadata for service development projects on its platform  Cloud Foundry Foundation, 2017 . Commercial  services  such  as  Amazon  Web  Services  and  Google  Cloud Platform handle metadata about applications and support imported metadata associated with applications. Daconta  2013  suggests metadata attributes that should be considered, in very general terms. He suggests that each resource should  have  a  unique  identifier  that  allows  a  range  of  attributes  to  be associated with that resource. The attributes  described using metadata  may be constant  e.g. title, creator, date of creation  or dynamic  such as usage and other transactional data . Taxonomies may be used to categorise the resources and linked data provides connections to other resources. However, none of this is specified in terms of actual metadata standards. Part of the problem is that cloud services encompass a very diverse range of data collections and resource  types.  It  is  unlikely  that  a  single  metadata  standard  would adequately address them all. That said, identifiers such as DOI are suited to wide-ranging resources and linked data has proven to be extremely flexible and  accommodating  of  different  data  types.  Other  researchers  have  also recognised the need to manage metadata associated with ‘big data’  Grunzke et al., 2014; Sweet and Moulaison, 2013 .  The role of linked data in open data repositories RDF triples are designed for linking data sets on the internet and are used to illustrate the way in which metadata operates in big data collections. RDF can be used to express metadata conforming to many different standards. The use of RDF also opens up the possibility of incorporating data from many open data sources that are available.  For instance, to build up triples in RDF for a semantic web application, it is necessary to identify the specific data element and its attributes that can be used to link different data sets together. So, a book title using an ISBN as the identifier may link to a bibliographic record with the citation details required to purchase the book from a publisher’s or bookseller’s database. It might also   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 207  VERY LARGE DATA COLLECTIONS  207  link to reviews of the book posted to a social media site, helping an individual reader or a library to make a purchasing decision.  A key strand of open government initiatives is making data gathered by public  sector  organisations  freely  available  to  the  public.  There  are  two requirements – the first is to make the public aware of the data sources, by means of resource discovery sources. The second requirement is to make the data usable, which can be achieved by providing the data in RDF triples. The open government initiative in the European Union, for instance, has resulted in large data collections becoming freely available for use by commercial organisations, academic researchers and even individuals. This has resulted in a metadata strategy and recommendations to public authorities responsible for publishing government data sets  European Commission, 2011 . Services that combine geographic data with public transport data, for instance, provide live departure and arrival boards for commuters in large cities around the world. Open government initiatives also improve accountability by making the operation of government more transparent to their populations.  To  make  the  data  sets  discoverable,  some  national  governments  have  created data portals. For example:  https:  data.gov.uk UK www.dati.gov.it Italy France www.data.gouv.fr  www.data.gov  USA  There are also international portals such as the European Union Open Data Portal  covering  over  10,500  data  sets,  which  are  described  using  DCAT metadata  Publications Office of the European Union, 2017; W3C, 2014a . The data sets are grouped in the following broad categories:     employment and working conditions   science   social questions   environment   economics   finance   trade   production, technology and research.  The European Data Portal, funded by the EU, contains details of over 600,000 data sets from the public sector in Europe  European Commission, 2017a . It harvests data from other catalogues of data sets, including national catalogues   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 208  208 PART III MANAGING METADATA  provided  by  each  of  the  EU  and  EEA  member  governments.  The  search interface allows refinement according to facets that include country, topic category,  format  of  data  and  licensing  arrangements   Figure  13.1 .  It advocates use of the Data on the Web Best Practices with suggested metadata fields for data set providers to include when registering resources on the data portal  Farias Lóscio, Burle and Calegari, 2017 .  Figure 13.1  Screenshot of search results from the European Data Portal   1995–2016,  European Union  Another service, Data Portals, has details of 520 data portals worldwide and uses the CKAN software for making data sets available  Open Knowledge International, 2017 . Many of these are local or national portals, some are subject-specific, and some resources describe ontologies or vocabularies that can be used for describing data sets. The CKAN system has the following metadata fields built in:   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 209  VERY LARGE DATA COLLECTIONS  209    title   unique identifier   groups   description   data preview   revision history   licence   tags – uncontrolled, although they can be organised into tag vocabularies  such as country, composer etc.    format s    API key   extra fields.  This is one of a number of data standards used by data portals. Others include Dublin Core, Project Open Data  POD , Data Catalog Vocabulary  DCAT  and Schema.org. The US Government Project Open Data analysis of the different metadata standards provides a useful table for comparison of metadata field equivalents  Table 13.1 .

This may be for historical reasons – particularly if the organisation is the result of a merger or take-over. There will be legacy databases that need to be reconciled. There   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 210  210 PART III MANAGING METADATA  may be very good operational reasons for keeping separate data sets – for instance, protecting sensitive personal data from unauthorised access. More often the data sets arise from specialist software applications used to run operations  such  as  finance,  customer  relationships,  marketing,  logistics, human resources, transactional processing – to name a few. Each of those specialist systems will have its own data structures and will handle data in ways that are specific to that application. Sometimes there will be common data standards for interchange of data between different systems, but the internal handling of the data may use proprietary standards. For instance, in the  library  management  field,  MARC  21  is  often  used  for  exchange  of catalogue data between systems, but the internal data format may be more complex to reflect internal management and auditing requirements.  The bigger challenge is unstructured content. The availability of powerful software  and  services  such  as  Google  Enterprise  Search,  SharePoint  and Oracle allows organisations to search very large repositories of documents that may have minimal structure. Although retrieval may be by means of probabilistic searching and ranking rather than matching exactly to Boolean operators, there are many challenges including duplication of content  all too common  and  exacerbated  by  the  lack  of  reliable  retrieval ,  different terminology or even language to describe the same concept or topic and mixed  media  content.  Individual  documents  may  have  some  structure, imposed by the software system or the organisational style manual, but there may be little direct correlation between different applications. Even within the  same  family  such  as  Microsoft  Office,  each  application  has  its  own document properties interface. The challenge is then to search across all these different formats.  Several researchers have considered the use of metadata as a solution to retrieval and management of unstructured document and content collections within an organisation. Initiatives include the DMS Mark-up Language, a metadata standard for multimedia content management systems  CMS , and the Darwin Information Typing Architecture  Paganelli, Pettenati and Giuli, 2006; Anderson and Eberlein, 2015; Sheriff et al., 2011; Bailie and Urbina, 2012 . The success of these approaches depends on the degree to which they can be incorporated into document or enterprise information management systems. Sheriff et al.  2011  identify the following sources for CMS metadata, which could form the basis for a general approach to organisational content:    generic metadata standards   content-dependent metadata   industry-dependent metadata   custom metadata  organisation-specific .   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 211  VERY LARGE DATA COLLECTIONS  211  Social media, web transactions and online behavioural advertising Metadata for social media brings up a number of issues such as personal data and privacy, as well as online behavioural advertising, which depends on metadata.  Metadata  associated  with  communications  and  messages  are another key area which has an impact on privacy and civil liberties. The past is littered with cases of abuse of personal data by the state  for ethnic cleansing and genocides, for instance .   This book started with a description of the Snowden revelations about the wholesale  collection  of  metadata  associated  with  telephone  and  e-mail communications  Greenwald, 2014 . By his account, the metadata was actually more revealing than the content of messages, because of their standardised form, which would facilitate analysis of large volumes of data. Metadata collected  by  the  US  National  Security Agency   NSA   included  details  of telephone numbers called, duration of calls, names of line subscribers along with location data.  Social  media  services  account  for  the  generation  of  huge  volumes  of content, as text, pictures, moving images, instant messaging, sound, etc. The files attached to social media postings such as images and documents usually have embedded metadata that is relevant to that file format. Standards for different media include MPEG, JPEG, and Dublin Core, discussed earlier in Chapter 4. Social media have also adopted standards for metadata to facilitate handling of postings. For instance, the Open Graph Protocol  described in Chapter 4 , developed by Facebook is widely used to describe the relationship between postings and between individual users of social media. Standards such as VIAF may also be useful for describing content.  A closer look at social network providers reveals a more detailed approach to metadata, designed to facilitate use of data about users and their online behaviour by applications that call out data from the social networks  APIs  and by online advertisers.   Although Facebook has recently placed some restrictions on the metadata that is available to third parties, it is still possible to glean a great deal of data. For instance, Facebook gathers to up to 98 data elements associated with individual users to build up profiles for digital advertising  Dewey, 2016 . The digital advertising business drives a great deal of activity on the internet. Social media companies  such as Facebook and LinkedIn , search engine providers  such as Google and Yahoo!  and large commercial and government websites gather data about web activity and use this for marketing, promotion or  public  information.  Aggregators  bundle  up  usage  data  and  sell  it  to advertisers or agencies so that ads can be directed to targeted audiences.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 212  212 PART III MANAGING METADATA  Figure 13.2 represents a simplified overview of the different agents involved in digital advertising.  Advertiser   Agency  Publisher  Ad  Exchange  Ad  Network  Figure 13.2 Agents involved in delivering online ads to users  A publisher of a website may belong to an ad network with a number of other publishers. Through the ad network they serve targeted ads to advertisers  or their agents  in return for a fee. The ad exchange provides a mechanism for trading ads in bulk so that advertisers get the best price and publishers are able to sell available ad space on their websites. They gather information on target audiences by placing a cookie on the browser of customers or visitors to their website. This tracks subsequent activity and allows the advertiser  or advertising agency  to build up a profile of that particular user’s interests. This then allows targeted advertising by serving ads at the appropriate point in a browsing session.  Research data collections Research data collections, such as the UK Data Archive  University of Essex, 2017   and  the  National  Climatic  Data  Center   National  Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration, 2017 , have been around for some time. With the move towards open data, many funders have started to require research data to be put in the public domain so that it is available to other researchers and the wider research community. Some of these are subject-based, some are incorporated into institutional repositories, and some are listed as part of open  government  initiatives.  Metadata  is  used  to  make  these  data  sets retrievable and to some extent to manage them.   The Open Discovery Initiative has recommended a minimum core set of metadata in repositories exposed to index-based discovery systems. There is a strong emphasis on bibliographic and media materials  Table 13.2 .  For data sets that are dynamic, there is the challenge of keeping track with   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 213  VERY LARGE DATA COLLECTIONS  213  Table 13.2  Core metadata elements to be provided by content providers  from Open  Discovery Initiative Working Group, 2014, 16   Field Name Title  Authors  Publisher Name  Volume Issue Page s    Date Date Range   Item Identiﬁer  Component Of Title  Component Of Title Identiﬁer  Item URL  Open Access Designation  Full Text Flag   Content Type*  Content Format  Deﬁnitions The main title of the item The author s  of the item.

Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 214  214 PART III MANAGING METADATA  those  changes  –  a  problem  of  lack  of  fixity   to  use  records  management terminology . There are also problems of consistency. One study of the Dryad data repository  which contains biology and ecology data sets  highlighted the problem of lack of consistency of use of data elements  Rousidis et al., 2014 . For instance, the way in which names are expressed in the dc.creator data element is inconsistent and error-prone. The paper suggests that an author identity system such as ORCID would overcome this problem. They even suggested that a link to the ORCID record would allow for updated author details to be automatically propagated to the metadata record. This may not be such a good idea, because the details at the point of creation of the record may be more relevant than the updated details. Providing a link to the updated record,  however,  does  allow  for  forward  tracking.  The  same  authors  also highlighted problems with variable date formats  if not system-generated  and suggest a validation algorithm. They also looked at dc.type and suggested that a controlled drop-down list should be used to guide the data entry personnel. There are three metadata management approaches highlighted in Chapter 11. De Waard  2016  introduces the idea of a research data needs pyramid, which nicely illustrates the different aspects of research data management and processes that need to be considered. Figure 13.3  groups these require - ments into three types: Saved, Shared and Trusted.  The model developed by de Waard refers to the FAIR principles developed  C  Trusted  SUCCESSFUL  DATA  Reusable  Reproducible  Reviewed  Comprehensible  Citable  Discoverable  Accessible  Preserved  Stored  Shared  Saved  Figure 13.3 A ‘pyramid’ of requirements for reusable data  de Waard, 2016    Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 215  VERY LARGE DATA COLLECTIONS  215  by  the  European  Union,  which  require  that  research  data  is  Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable  Wilkinson et al., 2016 . The focus of this  is  primarily  on  metadata  quality  and  standards  and  this  is  a  good demonstration of the key role that metadata plays in the management and use of research data sets. Findable means that the resource can be discovered via user queries. Metadata may be quite structured to allow retrieval via different criteria such as creator, dates, geographical location, or it may be descriptive of the topic or subject, which could be via a controlled vocabulary. Accessible means that the format is known to the user and that they have appropriate access rights. It may also relate to ability to perceive  such as special  interfaces  for  people  with  visual  impairments .  Interoperability ensures that information about the data  metadata  can be utilised on different systems or may be harvested via OAI-PMH protocols, for instance. It also allows for the data itself to be used by different applications or APIs. Linked data expressed in RDA is a good example of this type of interoperability  RDA Steering Committee et al., 2016 . The metadata should be reusable, preferably conforming to a standard and with appropriate licensing arrangements to allow re-use. One class of research collection is the compilation of web-scale discovery systems  such as Ebsco Discovery Service, Primo from Ex Libris, Summon from ProQuest and WorldCat Local from OCLC , which harvest metadata  from  a  number  of  sources.  This  raises  metadata  quality  and interoperability  issues,  including:  differences  in  granularity;  different metadata standards; ambiguous identities; differences between relevancy ranking algorithms; duplication of resources; different metadata harvesting schedules;  inclusion  of  open  access  material;  and  differing  licensing agreements  Breeding, Kroeger and Sandy, 2016 .  DataCite The DataCite metadata standard is for describing and disseminating research data  and  has  been  developed  with  strong  input  from  the  research  and academic communities. Its goals are to facilitate access to research data via the internet; make research citable in the scholarly content; and to support data  archiving   DataCite  Metadata  Working  Group,  2016 .  The  data  sets described  by  DataCite  metadata  include  numerical  and  other  types  of research data. DataCite is a member of the International DOI Foundation, which means that its member institutions mint DOIs for their data clients. There is a small mandatory set of metadata required to register research data:    DOI   Title   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 216  216 PART III MANAGING METADATA    Creator   Publisher   Publication Year   ResourceType  Recommended properties:    Subject   Contributor   Date   RelatedIdentifier   Description   GeoLocation  Optional properties:    Language   AlternativeIdentifier   Size   Format   Version   Rights   FundingReference  One of the challenges of maintaining dynamic data sets is the need to have a stable referencing system, but to be able to incorporate additional data as it is  produced.  Researchers  can  use  the  RelatedIdentifier  and  Version  data elements to specify updates to a data set.  Institutional repositories Institutional repositories grew rapidly in the academic sector in the early 2000s.  Academic  institutions  around  the  world  realised  that  there  were benefits from putting their research outputs and some research data and primary research resources on a system that would facilitate use and sharing internally and by the global academic community. They have become an important part of the preparation of bids for funding and for assessment of research quality. Access to research repository data is available via directory services such as OpenDOAR  University of Nottingham, 2014 . This type of service allows users to search across institutional repositories around the globe and to filter results by criteria such as subject, institution, software used and  country.  It  is  possible  to  search  by  institution,  by  collection  or  by   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 217  VERY LARGE DATA COLLECTIONS  217  individual item. Access to some items may be restricted because of copyright or licensing requirements of the intellectual property holders. So, for example, some journal publishers will allow pre-prints of articles or even post-prints of articles to be available to members of the institution that the research originated from, but not to external users of the repository. Although there are many different software platforms for institutional repositories, a few dominate the market. In the early days many institutions developed their own systems. Some commercial providers also developed institutional repository software with various degrees of integration with their library management systems. This allows  the  potential  of  an  integrated  search  interface  for  members  of  an institution. The most common software applications used for open repositories  of the 3320 repositories listed on OpenDOAR  are: DSpace  1473 , EPrints  452 , Digital  Commons   159 ,  and  Opus   80 .  The  distribution  of  repositories  is strongly  skewed  to  Europe   1503 ,  Asia   671   and  North  America   602   University  of  Nottingham,  2014 .  One  of  the  features  of  institutional repositories is their ability to interoperate. This means that there has to be a common exchange format, even if repository software applications have their own internal standards or the institution catalogues material to other standards. Dublin Core is the commonly accepted minimum require ment for exchange of metadata via OAI-PMH. Other, more detailed metadata standards such as MODS and MARC 21 are also widely used. Repository directory services such as OpenDOAR are metadata harvesting systems. They regularly interrogate the metadata stores of the institutional repositories that they know about and have access to and update their own central metadata store. This allows users a single interface to all the indexed institutional repositories and provides rapid retrieval. Pointers in the metadata store then allow access to individual records. Index-based  search  services   metasearch   are  taking  over  from  an  earlier generation of federated search services such as Copac in the UK. The UK’s National Biblio graphic Knowledgebase will replace Copac and may adopt an index-based  approach  such  as  that  used  by  WorldCat,  the  global  service operated by OCLC. These architectures are illustrated in Figures 13.5 and 13.6  pages 218 and 219 . Both of these architectures offer advantages over silo- based search ing  Figure 13.4 on the next page , where a user interrogates each individual repository in turn. The federated search services may de-duplicate search results to provide a consolidated list with pointers to the original sources. The index-based search service offers better performance and rapid retrieval, because the user does not have to wait for responses from many individual repositories to obtain comprehensive results.   The OAI-PMH  Open Archives Initiative – Protocol for Metadata Harvesting  standard is still widely used for metadata har vesting, although it has been superseded by ResourceSync  Lagoze et al., 2002; Open Archives Initiative,   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 218  218 PART III MANAGING METADATA  User  Figure 13.4 Silo-based searching  User  Federated  Search Service  Source  Repository  Source  Repository  Source  Repository  Source  Repository  Source  Repository  Source  Repository  Source  Repository  Source  Repository  Figure 13.5 Federated search service  2017 . The OAI-PMH is optimised for harvest ing metadata from catalogues of cultural and bibliographic objects. The ResourceSync is intended to be a more general harvesting protocol that allows for harvesting of meta data about digital objects, as well as the digital objects themselves. It can exploit sitemaps using metadata about the URL such as the location timestamps of last modification. An initial baseline synchronisation is necessary, but thereafter the destination system polls sources for metadata about changes that have taken place over a given time period and then compares with previous updates to determine   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 219  User  Index  Metadata harvesting  VERY LARGE DATA COLLECTIONS  219  Source  Repository  Source  Repository  Source  Repository  Source  Repository  Figure 13.6 Index-based discovery system  whether  it  is necessary  to  download  updated  material.  The  system  is unidirectional in that the destination service pulls the data from the source, but the source does not receive data from the destination service.  Conclusion Recent growth in interest about ‘big data’, data mining and very large data repositories has been paralleled by developments in metadata harvesting and search architectures. Metadata standards such as D-CAT have been developed to  help  structure  information  about  large  collections   Open  Archives Initiative, 2017 . This enhances interoperability between systems and helps to address some of the issues of data quality and consistency. Even in areas where there is formal control of the metadata, such as bibliographic collec - tions, the variety and variance in the use of cataloguing standards creates challenges for services that span different collections or institutions. This problem  is  magnified  when  searching  across  data  repositories  where individual data collections may be highly structured but there is little or no commonality between collections. Within organisations there is a separate problem of bringing together data and information items from multiple silos in different formats and often with little consistent internal structure. A good example is the proliferation of word-processed documents that may be made available via a document or records management system. These tend to rely on categorisation by purpose or tagging by authors. Powerful text retrieval techniques have improved access to documents, but do not fully address the problems of consistency, precision or recall. Social media generates huge   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 220  220 PART III MANAGING METADATA  volumes of transactional data and this is used to sell advertising to users. The digital advertising industry depends on metadata associated with user online transactions to build up these profiles as well as the personal data that is gathered  or  inferred  from  users’  social  media  profiles.  Research  data collections are a major enterprise, although this tends to be publicly funded. Standards  such  as  DataCite  produce  metadata  that  allows  data  sets  in repositories to be discoverable. Institutional repositories tend to focus more on bibliographic data associated with research publications, although some also contain primary data gathered in the course of research.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 221  CHAPTER 14  Politics and ethics of metadata  Overview This final chapter considers metadata in a political context. It considers three aspects of its role in society and speculates on possible future developments. There is the ethical strand, an increasingly important considerations for those involved anywhere in the information communication chain  Robinson, 2009 . It also considers where the power lies in both professional and subject domain terms and which professional groups are best equipped to develop and implement metadata standards. This section speculates on the role of metadata in the creation of new knowledge – a holy grail that has so far eluded  the  most  advanced  machine  learning  environments.  Finally  it  considers  the practicalities of funding. There is a huge industry dependent on metadata about online transactions, for instance. This forms the basis of digital marketing and the revenue streams for some of the largest incorporated companies, such as Alphabet  Google  and Facebook.  This  also  raises  the  issue  of  who  pays  for  the  creation  of  new  metadata standards,  and  who  funds  the  creation  of  metadata  on  a  massive  scale   all  those digitisation projects . Throughout, the chapter speculates on the future development and role of metadata.  Ethics An examination of the role of metadata raises many issues about privacy, security, ownership and control. It also raises issues about the digital divide and its possible role in making information accessible to wider audiences. It has the potential to empower the marginalised, hold government to account and  improve  individuals’  quality  of  life.  Understanding  metadata  is   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 222  222 PART III MANAGING METADATA  important  in  information  literacy  and  helps  individuals  to  navigate  the turbulent sea of opinions, fact-free news and propaganda.  Privacy and ownership In the context of social media, online usage and communications, metadata has  become  personal.  Much  of  the  data  about  internet  activities  and transactions is about personal activity and online behaviour. According to our original definition metadata describes an information object, whether that be raw data or more descriptive information about an individual. This is important because the treatment of metadata has become a political issue. Personal data, especially data that reveals opinions, attitudes and beliefs, is potentially very sensitive. Use of this personal data by service providers or by third parties can expose users to risks such as nuisance from unwanted ads, harassment from internet trolls or fraud through identity theft, if the data is not held or transmitted securely. Countering this, many digital advertisers would say that because the data is aggregated it is not possible to identify individuals – i.e. the data is anonymised. However, even the official guide - lines by bodies such as the ICO suggest that anonymisation of aggregated personal data is not foolproof  Information Commissioner’s Office, 2012; Chen and Li, 2013; Narayanan and Shmatikov, 2009 . It may be reversible, or personal identity may be revealed when combined with easily accessible data such as that from an electoral register.  Some commentators have suggested that a way around the problem of use of personal data is to strengthen the control an individual has over his or her personal data  Bond, 2010 . The idea of ownership of data extends to those who have access to it and even remuneration for being allowed to use that personal data. This is an idea that has taken hold since the proposal was put forward that personal data should be treated as a new asset class  World Economic  Forum,  2011 .  It  could  be  the  basis  for  a  new,  more  balanced relationship  between  individual  users  and  service  providers.  However, without legislation and the co-operation of the main digital content providers, it is difficult to see how such an approach would take root.   Security Metadata has become a political issue. Anyone who had asked the question ‘What does metadata matter?’ prior to 2013 will have been startled by the revelations about the US National Security Agency’s routine downloading of metadata  about  telephone  conversations  that  involve  non-US  citizens  Greenwald, 2013 . The Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution protects   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 223  POLITICS AND ETHICS OF METADATA  223  ‘The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures’  United States, 1791 . A lot hangs on the interpretation of privacy, as Solove  2011  has so eloquently discussed in his book Nothing to Hide. Individuals are monitored continually by CCTV cameras, through their communications and particularly their online activity, by security agencies, crime prevention and investigation agencies and by the digital advertising industry. They all exploit metadata that reveals information about us as individuals, whether it be online grocery shopping or hidden activity on the ‘dark net’. The metadata about these activities and transactions are the surrogate resource that is used to filter and aggregate data to find and act  on  leads.  Privacy  International    has  identified  the  following  types  of metadata that is gathered or could be gathered by security agencies:  Under the traditional definition of metadata, this information about our communications [surveillance metadata] would include:    the location that it originated from, e.g. home address of the telephone,  subscription information, nearest cell tower    the device that sent or made the communication, e.g. telephone identifier,  IMEI of the mobile phone, relatively unique data from the computer that sent a message    the times at which the message was made and sent   the recipient of the communication and their location and device, and time  received    information related to the sender and recipients of a communication, e.g.  email address, address book entry information, email providers, ISPs and IP address, and    the length of a continuous interaction or the size of a message, e.g. how long  was a phone call? how many bits in a message?   Privacy International, 2017   Addressing information inequality Another aspect of ethics is the growing information inequality. The digital divide  means  that  there  are  divisions  between  nations  as  well  as  within societies  Norris, 2001 . There is a large body of digital citizens leaving behind those excluded from society by poverty, age, lack of education. Metadata has a role in making information accessible to groups excluded, for instance, by physical  disability.  Schemes  such  as  the  W3C  Web  Content Accessibility Guidelines  WCAG  provide a framework for describing different aspects of accessibility for websites  Caldwell et al., 2008 .   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 224  224 PART III MANAGING METADATA  Metadata also has a key role in information discovery: getting information to those that need to know. Chapter 6 looked at information retrieval and the techniques used to make information accessible  such as metadata generated from controlled vocabularies . Information literacy is one way of addressing this and it could be argued that metadata awareness should be a part of information literacy.  Improving discovery Effective presentation of metadata enhances its usability. A key aspect of presentation is the ease of navigation and searching. The navigation system and search facilities have to accommodate the needs of different kinds of users. Some people interact with systems when they create a new document and they will need to create the metadata. Other users will be primarily interested in using metadata to retrieve electronic resources as searchers.   When  entering  metadata  an  author  may  need  access  to  a  controlled vocabulary,  in  order  to  select  appropriate  keywords.  The  terms  can  be presented in a number of ways:    A drop-down list – This method is suitable for short lists of terms, or  where there are a very limited number of possible options. It allows a user to immediately see the full range of choices available, and so help them to select the most relevant items.    A navigable classification scheme – This is more appropriate for a longer list  of controlled terms, where they can be categorised according to a classification scheme. Some applications that support thesaurus relationships can display terms in a hierarchy. This allows users to navigate through the classification until they find the appropriate term s .    A search – The user enters the term into a search box and is presented  with an alphabetical listing centred on the point of the search term entered. They can then browse the area and select the appropriate terms.    An automatic indexing system – Many systems offer automatic indexing capabilities. In effect the system examines the resource being described and suggests appropriate indexing terms. This technique can be used for keywords or subject descriptions, where the system refers automatically to a thesaurus of controlled terms as described earlier.  General users or searchers can interact with electronic systems using the first three options to identify relevant search terms or selection criteria for the metadata, and ultimately the resource that is described by the metadata.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 225  POLITICS AND ETHICS OF METADATA  225  User education Although there is increasing awareness of the existence of metadata, many users do not understand how metadata works. At the most basic level there is a need to identify which metadata fields are available for searching. If the content of the fields are controlled  either by cataloguing rules or by use of controlled vocabulary , the user needs to know where they can browse the available keywords or terms. More sophisticated searching will require an understanding of ways in which search queries can be combined so that, for instance, it is possible to search for the author and title of a book on Amazon, or to search for the subject category and date of creation of a web page on a government  portal.  Commentators  such  as  Phil  Bradley  have  written extensively about this  Bradley, 2013 .  The idea of the selective content has been around for some time, but was brought  to  prominence  in  The  Filter  Bubble  Pariser,  2011 .  Unexpected electoral results in 2016 such as the Brexit referendum in the UK and the Presidential  elections  in  the  USA  highlighted  the  problem  of  pollsters themselves  living  in  a  filter  bubble.  This  made  it  difficult  for  them  to understand or even acknowledge dissonant views from parts of the electorate that they do not usually consider significant. The other phenomenon has been ‘fact-free news’ which has affected the political discourse in the USA, Russia and the European Union in particular. In a former age this might have been called propaganda. Material is easily generated in response to the economic model that depends on driving traffic to websites and thereby generating income  from  advertising  revenue.  The  wilder  or  more  outrageous  the assertion the higher the traffic. This turns out to be an effective political campaigning  strategy  as  well.  The  distinction  between  speculation  and established fact backed by evidence is still as stark as it ever was, but the usage of  these  two  types  of  approach  is  becoming  blurred.  Services  such  as Facebook  do  not  discriminate  between  evidenced  material  and unsubstantiated speculations when they serve up the toxic mix of fact and fictions to their subscribers.   Service providers tailor content to suit our opinions as revealed by previous online activity. Ad blocking and cookie blocking limits the amount of data gathered about your online activity. Blocking also stops some of the benefits of cookies, such as continuity of sessions, tailoring of content and the ability to make purchases online.  What role does metadata play in all of this? At least part of the basis for selection of news stories to serve to users is based on matching a profile of past interests and internet behaviour with new content. It seems that we are more comfortable with news and commentary that reflects our own opinions and preconceptions  Norris, 2001, 18–19 . This is why so few liberals read   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 226  226 PART III MANAGING METADATA  conservative  newspapers  and  vice  versa.  Whether  the  metadata  is automatically generated or is manually applied to a news story  perhaps both occur , the net effect is that we are served content that reinforces our opinions and prejudices. Selection of news stories may be based on metadata associated with them – such as the source, the author, and key words and tags associated with the story. On platforms such as Twitter, user-allocated hashtags also play an important role. Hashtags arise spontaneously when someone notices a trend or decides to create one. There is no control, and a hashtag may have multiple meanings depending on who is using it.  For example, the terrorist attack on the UK Parliament in Westminster on 22  March  2017  prompted  a  lot  of  Twitter  activity  using  the  Parliament hashtag. For that time and context the hashtag was sufficiently specific, for a search two days later to yield tweets mainly about that incident. However, on  another  occasion  the  same  hashtag  may  have  an  entirely  different meaning.  The following metadata is available for scraping from the Twitter stream:  Twitter handle  of tweeter  Twitter handle  of correspondent  Relationship Relationship date Tweet URLs in tweet Domains in tweet Hashtags in tweet Tweet date Twitter page for tweet Imported ID In Reply To Tweet ID.  Fields were extracted from Twitter using NodeXL social analysis software  Hansen et al., 2011 .  Power Who owns the metadata space? There have been many successful collaborations, such as the one between librarians and the IT community to create Dublin Core as a metadata standard that  could  be  applied  to  web  resources.  However,  there  are  distinct communities with their own perspectives on metadata, such as: librarians,   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 227  POLITICS AND ETHICS OF METADATA  227  data scientists, database designers, geographic specialists, geneticists and statisticians. Chapter 1 considered the history of the concept of metadata and its emergence from early attempts to catalogue collections of scrolls, such as the catalogue of the Great Library of Alexandria more than 2500 years ago  Gartner, 2016, 16–18 . We consider not only the professional groups with specific concentrations of skills and experience, but also different subject domains that have been particularly preoccupied with the issue of describing information or data. We ask the question: ‘Who is best placed to develop, implement  and  use  metadata  in  the  future?’  Librarians,  information architects, database developers, and knowledge managers have all staked a claim  on  metadata.  Big  data  specialists  such  as  data  scientists,  business analysts and data modellers also have an interest in metadata. Each of these groups brings different skills to the metadata field and has its own perspective on how best to utilise and manage metadata. The development of metadata by  the  geographical  and  spatial  science  communities  arose  from  their intensive use of large volumes of data in a variety of formats and for a variety of  purposes.  This  meant  improving  the  precision  of  data  attribute descriptions. Geographic data is very diverse and may be used to delineate an area of land, describe an orbit around a planet or pinpoint a signal. The metadata allows systems to handle and interpret geographical or spatial data in an appropriate fashion. The precision of location data may vary from a country, from a street address or to very precise co-ordinates in a defined area. Location information pervades many other areas of activity, so that, for instance, the majority of local authority data has a geographical component. Metadata standards such as ISO 19115  ISO, 2014a  and INSPIRE  European Commission, 2017b  arise from the geospatial community.  Data dictionaries associated with database design and management are another form of metadata. Although it is beyond the scope of this book, which concentrates  on  data  about  documentary  resources,  some  of  the  data modelling techniques that they use are relevant  Hay, 2006 .  Subject-based communities that make intensive use of large volumes of data have developed metadata standards. These include genetics researchers, statisticians and clinical researchers.  Professionals of the future In  the  previous  edition  of  this  book  I  speculated  about  the  growth  of  a metadata community. Although activity in this area has expanded, a single, cohesive community has not emerged. If anything, it has fragmented further. There is a strong emphasis on bibliographic information and there have been some significant developments in cataloguing and resource description with   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 228  228 PART III MANAGING METADATA  the adoption of RDA  Resource Description and Access . There have been separate initiatives on identifiers – particularly those to do with people, and separate development of metadata used in the social media space. Although parts of the archives and records management communities have moved closer together, they continue to remain independent of the LIS community at large. It could be argued that the role of archives and records collections are  very  different  and  that  therefore  the  descriptive  requirements  and management needs are different. Even within the bibliographic community, the book trade has developed its own standards for metadata to facilitate e- commerce. At this juncture it seems that this fragmentation of metadata will continue and that a coherent metadata community is unlikely to emerge. Looking  to  metadata  initiatives  in  other  areas,  such  as  the  geospatial community,  we  see  even  further  fragmentation  and  the  possibility  of  a common framework for metadata receding over the horizon as the flotilla of initiatives disperses.  The more dynamic parts of the information disciplines are changing to incorporate  metadata  as  a  part  of  their  range  of  knowledge  and  skills. Metadata is an established part of many i-school syllabuses and other LIS academic courses. Job ads often feature the word ‘metadata’, as in ‘metadata librarian’ where previously ‘cataloguer’ might have sufficed. This suggests wider awareness of metadata and an appreciation of its role in LIS. The content  management  community  has  started  to  consider  a  systematic approach to documentation and use of metadata standards such as DITA  Bailie and Urbina, 2012 . Although it is beyond the scope of this book, it is an interesting area to watch and it may have an impact on the adoption of metadata standards generally.  Exploitation The major search engines have been another focus of metadata activity as new products based on the semantic web emerge. The Google Knowledge Base and  the  development  of  Schema.org  are  examples.  Open  data  initiatives around the world have resulted in the development of new products and services that combine data sets. Linked data technology  for example using RDA triples to describe data elements  has facilitated the combination and exchange of data. However, consistency of descriptions is a major problem. If different encoding schemes are used for the content of data elements, there may  be  a  problem  linking  them  or  with  information  retrieval  later  on. Nonetheless, there has been rapid growth of this sector and that seems set to continue. The first linked open data set was published in 2007. By the end of that year there were 28 data sets available which had grown to 203 data sets   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 229  POLITICS AND ETHICS OF METADATA  229  by 2010 and 570 by 2014. In February 2017 there were 1139 linked open data sets available  Abele et al., 2017 . Knowledge creation has been an ambition at least since the 1980s, when the Alvey Programme in the UK and Japan’s Fifth Generation Computer Systems project were in full swing  Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, 2015; ICOT, 1999 . The development of the semantic web in more recent years has provided an avenue for linking individual data elements based on their meaning. The EU-funded LOD2 project has explored advances in semantic web developments but has not addressed the creation of new knowledge  Auer, Bryl and Tramp, 2014 . It may be that knowledge creation cannot be separated from consciousness. If that is the case, then it would seem that the early dream of systems that could exploit existing data sets to create new knowledge is still a long way off. Whatever the agent  human or artificial intelligence , the idea that metadata could be used to navigate existing knowledge as a first step to synthesising new knowledge and insights remains an attractive one.   Money Who pays? One of the major challenges for any public initiative is finding the funding and resources to make it happen. Many public bodies are good at creating initiatives that address an issue of the moment, but then attention moves on to  other  topics.  The  infosphere  is  littered  with  abandoned  databases, protocols,  frameworks  and  information  services.  Creating  metadata  is expensive and research continues into the automatic generation of metadata. Approaches include automatic indexing, metadata extraction from data sets and use of specific tools to generate metadata automatically  Golub et al., 2016; Greenberg, 2009; Park and Brenza, 2015 .   Volunteer  cataloguing  is  an  alternative  approach  and  there  have  been useful initiatives where a few dedicated individuals have done an enormous amount  of  indexing  and  cataloguing.  Some  clever  initiatives  have  also allowed general users to contribute to indexing materials. This is particularly interesting for images and to some kinds of manuscript which cannot easily be converted into coded text with current technologies  Konkova et al., 2014 . For instance, the British Library Labs enables volunteers to transcribe images of catalogue cards into machine-readable records by crowdsourcing tasks  British Library Labs, 2017 .    Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 230  230 PART III MANAGING METADATA  Standards The standards development process is often prompted by the proliferation of incompatible  systems  that  arise  in  response  to  a  practical  problem.  As accepted good practices emerge, standards are often developed to codify that practice. Standards then provide a common approach. This is fundamental to the successful operation of metadata systems.  One of the most widely used metadata schemes, the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set is now an international standard, ISO 15836  ISO, 2009b . It provides a starting point for many application profiles developed by specific communities and individual organisations. It forms the basis of many other standards, such as FOAF, AGLS, eGMS, Europeana Data Model and Pundit  National Archives of Australia, 2008; e-Government Unit, 2006; Brickley and Miller, 2014; Net7 srl, 2017; Europeana Labs, 2016 .  Standards development is a helpful way of negotiating a system that all parties can work with. This is evident in the publishing industry and book trade, which is made up of conflicting and competing interests and yet has co-operated to develop the ONIX metadata system, because of the need of the  different  parties   book  retailers  and  publishers   to  exchange  data  EDItEUR, 2014 . Another example is the evolution of the national MARC standards into MARC 21, a unified standard adopted internationally  Library of Congress, 2017c . Standards development is often seen as a common good. Publicly funded organisations such as the Library of Congress in the USA or Jisc in the UK often lead standards development and provide the support and infrastructure for implementation. Commercial organisations such as data service providers and systems providers get involved to influence eventual standards that are used to define the market. A second source of standards development comes from commercial organisations that want to develop proprietary standards which tie customers into their products or services. Some  of  these,  such  as  Adobe’s  PDF  format,  have  reached  a  wider community. One of the tasks of bodies that sponsor national and international standards is to reconcile these different interests to produce a standard that can be widely adopted. This is an expensive process, which may be funded by private sector organisations with an interest in the standard. Professional bodies, trade associations and public bodies  particularly regulators  will all have a say in standards development and ratification. In this book we have seen  a  wide  range  of  organisations  involved  in  standards  development, including those listed in Table 14.1 opposite.  Re-examining the purposes of metadata The first edition of this book speculated about the purposes of metadata,   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 231  POLITICS AND ETHICS OF METADATA  231  Table 14.1 Metadata standards development  Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems  CCSDS   DCMI  EDItEUR  Facebook  IEEE Computer Society  International Council on Archives  International Federation of Library Associations  IFLA   International Organization for Standardization  International Telecommunication Union  Library of Congress  National Information Standards Organization  USA   OWL Working Group  PREMIS Editorial Committee  RDA Steering Committee W3C   Open Archival Information System  Dublin Core Metadata for the book trade Open Graph Protocol Metadata for learning objects Archive description Bibliographic description  Metadata and records management standards and encoding schemes Object identiﬁers  Bibliographic standards Open Archives Initiative  Ontology language Preservation metadata Bibliographic description Internet standards  which continues to be an overarching theme of this edition. The original model identified five main purposes of metadata. This has evolved into a six- purpose model that includes information governance as a distinct purpose:  1 resource identification and description 2 retrieving information 3 managing information resources 4 managing information rights 5 supporting learning, research and commerce 6 information governance.  The original five-point model described metadata in terms of its purposes. Although individual data elements may be used for more than one purpose, the purposes themselves remain distinct. So, for instance, there is a clear distinction between the title of a book, as a description of that book, and using words in the title for information retrieval. The model provides a way of examining metadata across a wide range of different application areas. A   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 232  232 PART III MANAGING METADATA  closer  look  at  the  new,  six-point  model  demonstrates  why  it  works  and provides some indication of how it might develop in the future.  Purpose 1: Resource identification and description  Chapter 5  Identification is seen as one aspect of description and is fundamental to other purposes. An identifier provides a ‘handle’ for a digital object and other information containers such as books, so that other processes such as retrieval, electronic trading or rights management can be performed.   The range of things being described using metadata will be extended. At present metadata is applied to works ranging from books to music and works of art. It is also applied to data collections and text-based electronic docu - ments. There is some interest in developing metadata schemas to describe knowledge, especially tacit knowledge  the knowledge in people’s heads . This suggests a view that people can be regarded as information resources or repositories. At the time of writing no major metadata standards had been developed for knowledge management, although some proprietary systems may have data dictionary definitions that could form the basis for future metadata schemes for knowledge. As discussed earlier, a key purpose of metadata is the ability to identify what is being described. Standards for identifiers can be incorporated into metadata as a way of controlling the content, and to facilitate linked data applications. Examples include ISBNs for  books,  Digital  Object  Identifiers   DOIs   for  text,  and  International Standard Name Identifiers  ISNIs   for people.  In the library sector, there are competing or overlapping identifier systems and it would be reasonable to anticipate some consolidation in this area, with the emergence of a single, universal identifier system for all kinds of entity. The  problem  is  determining  the  level  at  which  the  identifier  should  be applied. For instance, a work can have its own identifier, so can individual editions of a book, each with its own ISBN, and so can individual items in a collection – typically identified by an accession number, a bar code or an RFID  radio frequency identifier  chip.   Purpose 2: Retrieving information  Chapter 6  The second purpose of metadata is one that has attracted more commentary and speculation than any other. It is the focus of a great deal of the work on metadata standards for web resources, such as Dublin Core. The retrieval purpose ties in the description as a means of evaluating a resource when it has been retrieved.   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 233  POLITICS AND ETHICS OF METADATA  233  Image  retrieval  continues  to  present  challenges  of  interpretation.  For example: What is the most significant element of a picture? What does it mean? Automated image indexing depends on shape, colour and texture, but does not address the ‘meaning’ or interpretation of an image, although some advances in image recognition technology are beginning to tackle this. The greatest advances have been made in facial recognition, so that it is now possible to automatically name individuals in a picture. Indexing is one of the ways of improving retrieval performance. However, the costs of indexing are high and there are continued efforts to find ways of automating this process.  The  development  of  machine  learning  systems  to  analyse  and categorise text-based works is already well advanced. However, some text, particularly manuscripts, depend on human interpretation. People are still required to set up classification systems or subject terminologies that reflect the  areas  being  indexed.  Some  machine  learning  systems  do  not  use controlled vocabulary, but work on the basis of feedback from users to build up a ‘picture’ of what the user wants. These heuristic systems are based on experience and not necessarily codified into any formal rules.   Purpose 3: Managing information resources  Chapter 7  Management of information resources continues to be a major factor in the application of metadata. Since the first edition this purpose has expanded to encompass management of research data, as well as linked data applications. Metadata  in  the  office  environment  has  to  deal  with  collections  of unstructured documents in a variety of formats. Each document may have its own  internal  structure,  but  there  is  not  necessarily  any  consistency  of document structure across the whole collection. The concept of the document or digital lifecycle is still a helpful means of identifying the different activities and procedures that are required during a document’s life in a collection. Chapter 7 showed how metadata can be used to manage the workflow of records and archival materials.  One of the key challenges remains the effective and consistent management of information. Metadata standards help this process by making the job of application developers easier. Although standards have been created to codify the management of records  ISO 15489 , these are in very general terms and have not had the impact on the document and records management systems market that was anticipated in 2004. In the library and information field, metadata standards are in transition. Although MARC 21 has become a de facto standard for exchange of bibliographic data, the standard is due to be replaced by BIBFRAME, which is intended to reflect FRBR and the new RDA cataloguing  standard.  This  represents  a  distinct  conceptualisation  of   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 234  234 PART III MANAGING METADATA  bibliographic  records  away  from  item-by-item  cataloguing  and  towards cataloguing of works, with sub-records for expressions, manifestations and items.  Another  major  challenge  remains  the  lack  of  compatibility  between encoding systems. Even if the same metadata standard is used, the content of individual fields  data elements  may be different.   Preservation was included in the management category, as it is one of the stages in the lifecycle of information resources or entities described by the metadata.  The  PREMIS  metadata  standard  was  developed  for  managing digital resources and is geared to digital preservation activities.  Purpose 4: Managing intellectual property rights  Chapter 8  Rights and provenance are closely tied into one another when it comes to intellectual property rights. The creator or the organisation that paid for the creation of content may also have copyright or performance rights associated with the document. In the museum and archive context provenance may also be required to determine the authenticity of an item.  The open access movement, with initiatives such as Creative Commons, has grown in the last decade and is now a major consideration for academic publishing   Creative  Commons,  2016;  University  of  Nottingham,  2014; Publications Office of the European Union, 2017 . Issues of ownership of intellectual property have also caused extensive debates in the social media world, with providers such as Facebook developing policies that explicitly state that users do not transfer their intellectual property rights to the social media platform when they upload content that they have created, whether that be text or photographs, sound or moving images. The metadata attached to those items or associated with the postings can be seen as an indication of ownership.   Rights management has been tumultuous over the last decade, particularly in the context of music and video recording. As the technology for exchanging recordings online became widely available, piracy was a major preoccupation for the recording industry. Downloading music via the internet, even when legitimate, raised problems of paying fees and royalties based on use of individual  items.  The  lack  of  control  of  downloading  has  led  to  a transformation of the music industry, with much greater emphasis on live performance – an outcome that perhaps was not envisaged 10 or 15 years ago. Attempts by the recording industry to prosecute music fans for uncontrolled and technically illegal copies of music performances backfired with a few, well publicised cases. Where listeners do use established and regulated sites for purchasing licences for music tracks the metadata associated with those   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 235  POLITICS AND ETHICS OF METADATA  235  tracks allows large numbers of small transactions to be aggregated into global payments to artists and groups.  Purpose 5: Supporting e-commerce and e-government  Chapter 9  E-commerce and e-government both support transactions over the internet. E-government  is  targeted  at  the  citizen  and  has  evolved  from  the  early internet days of simply providing information to more interactive services such as submission of tax returns, registration of life events and applying for benefits.  Online behavioural advertising accounts for a very large volume of online transactions. The industry relies on capturing metadata about the online behaviour of individual consumers. This enables them to target advertising at  appropriate  groups.  OBA  raises  issues  of  privacy  in  light  of  the  large amount of personal data that is gathered from social media.  E-commerce is exemplified by the ONIX system, which is widely used by the global book and publishing industry. Common metadata standards allow disparate systems to communicate and exchange information and readily allows different models of commerce to co-exist. This means that a publisher may  communicate  directly  with  a  bookshop,  or  may  work  through  an aggregator who distributes to multiple bookshops. It also allows publishers to use several different aggregating services covering different geographical territories.  E-government  has  placed  a  lot  of  emphasis  on  communication  of information to citizens and residents. This has led to the development of metadata standards and encoding schemes for governmental information. More  recently  there  has  been  a  move  to  make  government  data  sources available  for  commercial  exploitation  through  the  open  data  movement. Individual agencies have developed interfaces to allow individuals to do simple transactions online, such as registration of life events, applications for passports and submission of tax returns.  Purpose 6: Information governance  Chapter 10  With the increases in concern about security and ongoing requirements to comply with legislation, information governance has become more important. Metadata plays a key role in providing evidence of transactions and an audit trail of who has created, amended or accessed specific documents or data. Although information governance can be seen as a sub-set of information management,  it  is  a  sufficiently  important  activity  to  be  recognised  as  a purpose of metadata in its own right.    Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 236  236 PART III MANAGING METADATA  Verifying the authenticity of data is another area of growing concern. Many organisations  are  moving  away  from  archiving  paper  records  to  digital preservation and management of electronic records. Providing an audit trail of individual documents will become increasingly important to validate their content and to ‘prove’ their authenticity and integrity. Electronic documents are perceived as being susceptible to alteration after they have been finalised. In practice they are no more susceptible than paper documents, especially if there  is  metadata  embedded  in  the  document.  Many  common  office applications generate their own metadata, which includes a trail of alterations made  to  the  document  throughout  its  life. An  obvious  step  would  be  to standardise this type of metadata. Because legal admissibility and evidential weight of electronic documents depends on jurisdiction, there are national standards such as that produced by the BSI  2014 .   Managing metadata itself The third part of this book is largely new material that has arisen from a consideration of the challenges of managing metadata itself. This book set out to introduce the concept of metadata and the ideas that led to its development. This provided a basis for a description of the purposes of metadata. It is helpful  to  consider  this  from  two  perspectives:  that  of  a  manager  of information resources  whether that be a librarian, archivist, museum curator, digital repository manager or web manager ; and that of user. We all consume information for leisure, for work, for survival in a digital economy. A lot of information is thrown at us via social media and through online behavioural advertising, through broadcast media, and by government. We also seek out information in response to specific needs or out of curiosity. It may be a clearly defined need that can be addressed by a simple search. Often it is not straightforward. We may have difficulty describing our requirements or we may be unfamiliar with the language that is used by those that provide the information we are seeking. I hope that this book has opened up some of the possibilities and has provided a better understanding of the way in which metadata contributes to this.  It is clear that it is necessary to control the content of metadata fields if there is to be consistent performance and retrieval. The development of encoding schemes has evolved into the creation of ontologies to represent specific areas of knowledge. These allow for more complex relationships than the simple hierarchies that are usually found in classification schemes. The growth of the  internet  has  stimulated  the  development  of  thinking  about  faceted classification and groups such as the International Society for Knowledge Organization  have  organised  conferences  and  seminars  to  explore  the   Haynes 4th proof 13 December 2017  13 12 2017  15:38  Page 237  POLITICS AND ETHICS OF METADATA  237  development of faceted classification  ISKO, 2017 . The emergence of big data has brought its own challenges and the use of linked data to create new services  from  multiple  sources  of  information  has  been  an  interesting development. This seems likely to continue.  Finally,  we  have  considered  the  politics  of  metadata.  Who  owns  the metadata, how is it manipulated and what are the consequences of doing so? We have considered areas that are likely to become increasingly important in the coming years as we see the change in political climate and the emergence of a more authoritarian and conformist mind-set among politicians and  it might  be  argued   the  electorate.  This  raises  issues  of  tracking  use  of information, privacy and human rights. This is particularly worrying where individual online behaviour is tracked in order to identify dissidents. At what point is dissent considered a threat? Does expressing a view, no matter how abhorrent to the majority of the population, constitute a crime, or should people have the right to hold and express extreme views? These are open questions where the debate will continue.  Conclusion In the first edition of this book, I speculated on whether metadata as a concept was here to stay. Metadata has been around for at least 2500 years in the form of library catalogues. During that time it has been transformed into something with  a  wide  range  of  applications  and  operating  in  very  complex environments. Since 2004 it has become established as a label for job titles and it has also emerged into the public awareness following high-profile news stories. It is not a passing fad, but nor has it become a single discipline with a coherent body of knowledge. The usage of the term ‘metadata’ is still very varied and cuts across a number of distinct professional communities.  If there is a message from all of this, it is that the purposes of metadata continue to be relevant and provide a useful insight into the way in which metadata standards operate. Recent events have also demonstrated the wide relevance of metadata to the everyday activity of all of us as users of the internet  or  of  telecommunications  networks.  The  data  and  metadata generated by our activity is a powerful marketing and monitoring tool that can enhance and enrich our lives. However, we have to be aware of the harm that can result from misuse and be vigilant about encroachments on privacy and human rights.
