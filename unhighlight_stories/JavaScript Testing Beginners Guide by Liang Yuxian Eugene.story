Although  there are many JavaScript frameworks in the market, learning to write, test, and debug  JavaScript without the help of any framework will make you a better JavaScript developer.  However, testing and debugging can be time-consuming, tedious and painful. This book will  ease your woes by providing various testing strategies, advice, and tool guides that will make  testing smooth and easy.  This book is organized in an easy-to-follow, step-by-step tutorial style, in order to maximize  your learning. You will first learn about the different types of errors that you will most   often encounter as a JavaScript developer. You will also learn the most essential features   of JavaScript through our easy-to-follow examples.  As you go along, you will learn how to write better JavaScript code through validation;  learning how to write validated code alone will help you improve tremendously as a  JavaScript developer and, most importantly, help you to write JavaScript code that runs  better, faster, and with less bugs.  As our JavaScript program gets larger, we need better ways of testing our JavaScript code.  You will learn about various testing concepts and how to use them in your test plan. After  which, you will learn how to implement the test plan for your code. To accommodate more  complex JavaScript code, you will learn more about the built-in features of JavaScript, in  order to identify and catch different types of JavaScript error; such information helps to   spot the root of the problem so that you can act on it.   Finally, you will learn how to make use of the built-in browser tools and other external tools  to automate your testing process.   Preface  What this book covers  Chapter 1, What is JavaScript Testing?, covers JavaScript's role and the basic building blocks  in web development, such as HTML and CSS. It also covers the types of errors that you will  most commonly face.  Chapter 2, Ad Hoc Testing and Debugging in JavaScript, covers why we perform ad hoc testing  for our JavaScript programs, and JavaScript's most commonly-used features, by writing a  simple program, This program will be used as an example to perform ad hoc testing.  Chapter 3, Syntax Validation, covers how to write validated JavaScript. After completing this  chapter, you will have improved your skills as a JavaScript developer and, at the same time,  understood more about the role of validation in testing JavaScript code.  Chapter 4, Planning to Test, covers the importance of having a plan to test, and the strategies  and concepts we can use when we are performing testing. This chapter also covers the  various strategies and concepts for testing, and we will perform a simple test plan to see  what it means to plan to test.  Chapter 5, Putting the Test Plan Into Action, follows Chapter 4, as we apply the simple test  plan that we have developed. Most importantly, we will get our hands dirty by uncovering  bugs, taking note of them and fixing the bugs by applying the theories that we learnt   in Chapter 4.  Chapter 6, Testing More Complex Code, covers sophisticated ways to test our code. One way  of testing the code is to use the built-in error objects provided by JavaScript. This chapter  also covers how to use the console log, how to write your own messages, and how to trap  your errors.  Chapter 7, Debugging Tools, addresses the point where our code gets too large and complex  to be tested by using manual methods. We now engage the help of debugging tools provided  by popular browsers in the market, including Internet Explorer 8, FireFox 3.6, Chrome 5.0,  Safari 4.0 and Opera 10.  Chapter 8, Testing Tools, moves into how you can automate your testing by using testing tools  that are free, cross-browser and cross-platform. It also covers how to test your interface,  automate tests, and perform assertion and benchmarking tests.  [  ]   Preface  Browsers like Internet Explorer 8, Google Chrome 4.0, Safari 4.0 and newer, FireFox 3.6.  What you need for this book  A basic text editor such as Notepad++.  JavaScript version 1.7 or later.  Other software covered includes Sahi, JSLitmus, QUnit.  Who this book is for  This book is for beginner JavaScript programmers or beginner programmers who may have  little experience in using JavaScript, with HTML and CSS.  Conventions  In this book, you will find several headings appearing frequently.  To give clear instructions of how to complete a procedure or task, we use:  Time for action – heading 1.	 Action 1 2.	 Action 2 3.	 Action 3  Instructions often need some extra explanation so that they make sense, so they are  followed with:  What just happened? This heading explains the working of tasks or instructions that you have just completed.  You will also find some other learning aids in the book, including:  Pop quiz – heading These are short multiple choice questions intended to help you test your own understanding.  [  ]   Preface  Have a go hero – heading These sections set practical challenges and give you ideas for experimenting with what you   have learned.  You will also find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of  information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.  Code words in text are shown as follows: "We can include other contexts through the use of  the include directive."  A block of code is set as follows:   <input type="submit" value="Submit"         onclick="amountOfMoneySaved moneyForm.money.value "  >        When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines  or items are set in bold:  function changeElementUsingName a {      var n = document.getElementsByName a ;     for var i = 0; i< n.length; i++ {     n[i].setAttribute "style","color:ffffff" ;     } }  New terms and important words are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in  menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "Clicking the Next button  moves you to the next screen".  Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.  Tips and tricks appear like this.  [  ]   Preface  Reader feedback  Feedback from our readers is always welcome.

First of all, let me welcome you to this book. If you've picked up this book, I  would assume that you are interested in JavaScript testing. You most probably  have experienced JavaScript, and want to enhance your skills by learning how  to test your JavaScript programs. JavaScript is most often associated with the web browser and is one of the   key tools for creating interactive elements on web pages. However, unlike   server-side languages like PHP, Python and so on, JavaScript fails silently in  general  although browsers like IE provides warning messages at times ; there  are no error messages to inform you that an error has occurred. This makes  debugging difficult. In general, we will be learning about the basic building blocks for JavaScript  testing. This will include the basics of HTML  Hyper-text Markup Language , CSS   Cascading Style Sheets   and JavaScript. After this, you will learn about various  techniques to make HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together; these techniques  are the building blocks of what you are going to learn in other chapters.  To be more specific, this is what we will learn about in this chapter:                The basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript The syntax of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript How to select HTML elements by using CSS and JavaScript Why do web pages need to work without JavaScript? What is testing and why do you need to test? What is an error? Types of JavaScript errors   What is JavaScript Testing?  Examples shown in this chapter are simplistic—they are designed to allow you to see the  major syntax and built-in methods or functions that are being used. In this chapter, there will  be minimal coding; you will be asked to enter the code. After that, we'll briefly run through  the code examples and see what is happening.  With that in mind, we'll get started right now.  Where does JavaScript fit into the web page?  Every web page consists of the following properties—content, appearance, and behavior.  Each of these properties is controlled by Hyper Text Markup Language  HTML , Cascading  Style Sheets  CSS , and JavaScript, respectively.  HTML Content HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the dominant markup language for web  pages. In general, it controls the content of a web page. HTML defines web pages  or HTML  documents  through semantic markups such as  ,  ,  , and   toto  control headings, the body of a document, forms, paragraphs, and so on. You can see   HTML as a way to describe how a webpage should look like.  HTML makes use of markup tags, and these tags usually come in pairs. The syntax of HTML is  as follows:   some of your content enclosed here   Notice that the HTML tags are enclosed by angular brackets; the HTML tag pair starts off with    and ends with and ends with  . This second HTML tags are  known as the closing tags and they have a forward slash before the HTML tag.  Some of the common HTML elements include the following:                                       For a complete list of html elements, please visit http:  www.w3schools.com tags  default.asp.   [  ]   Chapter 1  Time for action – building a HTML document We are going to create an HTML document by making use of some of the HTML tags and  syntax that we have seen above.  The example you see here can be found in the source code  folder of Chapter 1, with the document titled chapter1-common-html.html   1.	 Let's start by opening your favorite text editor or tool such as Microsoft Notepad,   and creating a new document.  2.  Enter the following code into your new document and save it.  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN"  "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-transitional.dtd">      This is a sample title       This is header 1   This is header 2   This is header 3   This is a paragraph.

Finally, open the document in your browser and you will see an example similar to   the following screenshot:  [ 10 ]   Chapter 1  Take note of the black box on the upper-right corner. It is a simple example  of CSS at work. This will be explained shortly.  What just happened? You have just created an HTML document by using the more common HTML elements and   HTML syntax.  Each HTML tag has a specific purpose, as you can see from the result in the browser. For  example, you must have noticed that  This is header 1  produced the largest  text in terms of font-size,  This is header 2  produced the second largest text  in terms of font size, and so forth.      represents an ordered list, while     stands for an unordered list   list with bullet points .  You should have noticed the use of    . This is used to define a section within  an HTML document. However, the effects and power of the     can only be  seen in the next part of this chapter.  But wait, it seems that I have not done a complete introduction of HTML. That's right. I have  not introduced the various attributes of HTML elements. So let's have a quick overview.  Styling HTML elements using its attributes In general, the core attributes of HTML elements are the class, id, style, and and title  attribute. You can use these attributes in the following manner:    Your  content here    Notice that all four attributes could be used at the same time. Also, the sequence of the  attributes does not matter.  But we have not done any styling yet. The styling only takes place in the style attribute.  To see an example, enter the following code between the   and   tag in the  previous code.  <div style= "position:absolute; background-color:black;color:ffffff;  top:10px;right:10px;border:solid 3px yellow; height:200px;  width:200px;">Your content here    [ 11 ]   What is JavaScript Testing?  You should be able to see a 200px by 200px black box with yellow border in the upper-right  corner of your browser window  as shown in the previous screenshot . Here's a screenshot  that shows only the black box:  In general, the inline style that you have specified manipulates the stylistic properties of thethe  style attribute, to make it look the way you want it to.  Only the the style attribute allows you to style the HTML element. But this method is only  used for specifying inline style for an element.  In case you are wondering what the   tag does, it is essentially an attribute that  specifies extra information about an element. This is most often used within the   tag.  If you open up any HTML document that contains a   tag, you will find the contents  of this tag in the tab of your browser or title of your browser window.  What about id attribute and class attribute? We'll cover these briefly in the next section.  Specifying id and class name for an HTML element In general, the id attribute and class attribute allows the HTML element to be styled by  giving the CSS  Cascading Style Sheets, which we will be covering later in this chapter  a way  to refer to these elements. You can think of the id attribute and class attribute as a 'name',  or a way to identify the corresponding HTML element such that if this 'name' is referred by  the CSS, the element will be styled according to the CSS defined for this particular element.  Also, the id attribute and class attribute are often referred to by JavaScript in order to  manipulate some of the DOM  Document Object Model  attributes, and so on.  There is one important idea that you must understand at this point of the chapter: the id  attribute of each HTML element has to be unique within an HTML file, whereas the class  attribute doesn't.  Cascading Style Sheets CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. A CSS is used to control the layout, appearance, and  formatting of the web page. CSS is a way for you to specify the stylistic appearance of the   HTML elements. Via CSS, you can define the fonts, colors, size, and even layout of the   HTML elements.  [ 12 ]   Chapter 1  If you noticed, we have not added any form of CSS styles to our HTML document yet; in the  previous screenshots, what you see is the default CSS of our browser  apart from the black  box on the upper-right , and most browsers have the same default CSS if no specific CSS   is defined.  CSS can be internal or external; an internal CSS is embedded in a HTML document using the    tag, whereas an external CSS is linked to by using the   tag, for example: tag, for example:    .  In general, using internal CSS is considered to be a bad practice and should be avoided.  External CSS is widely favored over internal CSS because it allows us to save more time and  effort as we can change the design of the website by just making changes to a .css file  instead of making individual changes to each HTML document. It also helps in improving  performance, as the browser will only need to download one CSS and cache it in memory.  The most important point for this section is the use of CSS selectors and the syntax of   the CSS.  The CSS selectors work as follows: for selecting IDs, the name of the ID is preceded by a   hash character. For a class selector, it is preceded by a dot. In the code that you will be seeing  later, you will see that both ID and class selectors are used  they are also commented in the  source code . Here's a quick preview of the selectors:   * this is a id selector *  nameOfID {      * properties here*  }   * this is a class selector *  .nameOfClass {         * properties here*  }  The syntax of the CSS is as follows: selector { declaration } . The declaration consists of a  semicolon-separated list of name or value attribute pairs, in which colons separate the   name from the value.  Remember that we've mentioned the id attribute and class attribute in the preceding  section? Now you will see how id attributes and class attribute are being used by CSS.  [ 13 ]   What is JavaScript Testing?  Time for action – styling your HTML document using CSS Now we are going to style the HTML document that we created in the preceding section, by  using CSS. For simplicity, we'll use an internal CSS. What will happen in this section is that For simplicity, we'll use an internal CSS. What will happen in this section is that  you will see the CSS syntax in action, and how it styles each HTML element by making use   of the id attribute and class attribute of the respective HTML element. Note that both   id and class selectors are used in this example.  The completed version of this example can be found in the source code folder  of Chapter 1, with the file name: chapter1-css-appearance.html  1.	 Continuing from the previous example, open up your text editor and insert the   following code after the   tag:   body{     background-color:cccccc; }  * Here we create a CSS selector for IDs by a name preceded by a  hash character *  container{     width:750px;  * this makes the width of the div element with  the id 'container' to have a width of 750px *      height:430px;     border:1px solid black;solid 1px black;  }  * [nameOfElement] *  boxed1{     background-color:ff6600;        border:2px solid black;      height:360px;     width:300px;     padding:20px;             float:left;           margin:10px; }  boxed2{     background-color:ff6600;     border:2px solid black;     height:360px;     width:300px;  [ 14 ]   Chapter 1      padding:20px;             float:left;          margin:10px; } ordered1{     font-size:20px;     color:ce0000;     text-align:center; } unordered1{     font-size:12px;     color:000f00;    } ordered2{     font-size:20px;     color:ce0000;     text-align:center; } unordered2{     font-size:12px;     color:000f00;    } unordered2.nice{     font-size:16px;     } .intro{     color:black;     font-weight:bold; } a:link {color:FF0000;}       * unvisited link *  a:visited {color:00FF00;}   * visited link *  a:hover {color:FF00FF;}   * mouse over link *  a:active {color:0000FF;}   * selected link *     2.	 After adding the CSS code above, you will need to add class and id attributes to   your HTML elements. Here's the stuff you'll need to add:             This is a paragraph. I am styled by a class  called "intro"     [ 15 ]   What is JavaScript Testing?         I am enclosed within a  div  tag. And I  can  be styled on a document level.                        This is an ordered list and it is centered               apple               orange               banana                                    This is an unordered list.               apple               orange               banana                              I am a link that is styled by a  class              I am enclosed within a  div  tag. And I  am styled on a local level.                        This is an ordered list and it is centered               apple               orange               banana                                    This is an unordered list  and I have a class  defined               apple               orange               banana                              I am a link that is styled by a  class               [ 16 ]   The class and id attributes that need to be added are highlighted in the  code snippet above. If you are not sure if you have done it correctly, open  up chapter1-css-appearance.html and have a look.   3.	 Now save the file and open it in your browser. You should see that your HTML  save the file and open it in your browser. You should see that your HTML  document now looks different to how it was before it was styled by CSS. Your   output should be similar to the example shown in following screenshot:  Chapter 1  What just happened? You have just applied CSS to the HTML document that you created in the previous section.  Notice that you have used both the id selector and class selector syntax. Within each  selector, you should also see some stylistic attributes.  The HTML elements in this example are similar to the previous example, except that the  HTML elements now have id and class names.  In the following sub-sections, I'll continue to explain the techniques used for referring to the  various HTML elements, and how we styled the elements by using their stylistic attributes.  [ 17 ]   What is JavaScript Testing? Referring to an HTML element by its id or class name and styling it We referenced various HTML elements by its id or class name. Consider the following  code snippet in the above example:      This is a paragraph. I am styled by a class called  "intro"     This is enclosed within a  div  tag. And it is  styled on a local level.                        This is an ordered list and it is centered               apple               orange               banana                                    This is an unordered list  and has a class defined<  li>              apple               orange               banana                           This is a link that is styled by a  class         The highlighted code refers to the HTML elements where ids and class name attributes  are being used. Notice that some of the HTML elements have both ids and class name  attributes while some do not.  Now consider the CSS snippet which is found in the example:  boxed1{     background-color:ff6600;     border:2px solid black;     height:360px;     width:300px;     padding:20px;             float:left;           margin:10px; }  [ 1 ]   The boxed1 selector refers to the   with the id boxed1 in the HTML document.  Notice that the   with the id boxed1 is styled according to the name and value  attribute pairs within the declaration. If you make some changes to the value attribute   and refresh your browser, you will notice changes to the boxed1 element as well.  Chapter 1  Now, consider the following CSS snippets:  .intro{     color:black;     font-weight:bold; }  And:  a:link {color:FF0000;}       * unvisited link *  a:visited {color:00FF00;}   * visited link *  a:hover {color:FF00FF;}   * mouse over link *  a:active {color:0000FF;}   * selected link *   The previous  two code snippets are what we call class selectors, which have a slightly  different syntax than the id selectors. For instance the .intro class selector selects the    with class name "intro" while the a:link , a:visited, a:hover, and a:active  selectors refer to the four states of an anchor pseudo class.  Until now, we have covered how CSS selectors work to select HTML elements in an HTML  document. But we have not covered the situation where an HTML element has both id and  class attributes; we'll explain it now.  Differences between a class selector and an id selector Although id selectors and class selectors appear to be the same, there are subtle  differences. For instance, the id selector is used to specify a single HTML element,   whereas the class selector is used to specify several HTML elements.  For example, you may try changing the anchor element     to   and you would notice that the link is now bold. and you would notice that the link is now bold.  If an HTML element has a style attribute that is controlled by both the stylistic  attributes of an id and class selector, then the style attributes in the class  selector will take precedence over those in the id selector.  [ 1 ]   What is JavaScript Testing? Other uses for class selectors and id selectors In the following section, you will learn that the id and class name of an HTML element  play an important role in providing interactivity on a web page. This is done by using  JavaScript, where JavaScript makes a reference to an HTML element either by its id or  class name, after which various actions such as DOM manipulation are performed on   the HTML element that is referenced.  Complete list of CSS attributes The examples given here are not complete. For a complete reference to CSS, you may visit  http:  www.w3schools.com css css_reference.asp.  JavaScript providing behavior to a web page In this section we'll cover some of the key aspects of JavaScript. In general, if HTML provides  content for an HTML document and CSS styles the HTML document, then JavaScript breathes  life into an HTML document by providing behavior to the webpage.  The behavior can include changing the background colour of an HTML document  dynamically, or changing the font size of the text, and so on. JavaScript can even be   used to create effects such as animating slideshows, and fade-in and fade-out effects.  In general, the behaviors are event-based, and are achieved by manipulating the DOM in  real-time  at least from the users' point of view .  In case you are fairly new to JavaScript, JavaScript is an interpreted programing language  with object-oriented capabilities. It is loosely-typed, which means that you do not need to  define a data type when declaring variables or functions.  In my opinion, the best way to understand the language features of JavaScript is through an  example. Now, it's time for action.  Time for action – giving behavior to your HTML document We are going to apply JavaScript to an HTML document  styled with CSS . In general, the  HTML elements and CSS are not changing as compared to the previous example, except that  you will see HTML buttons added to the HTML document.  The JavaScript applied to the HTML document in this example is known as inline JavaScript  because it exists within the HTML document.  [ 20 ]   Chapter 1  What we are trying to accomplish here is to show you the language features such as how to  declare variables, functions, manipulating DOM of the HTML elements, and various methods  of referencing HTML elements by their id or class. You will also learn about some of the  commonly-used built-in methods of arrays, and elements that are referenced, and how to  use them to make your tasks easier.  This example is nothing fancy, but you will learn some of the most important and   commonly-used techniques for referencing HTML elements and then manipulating the DOM.   The completed code for this example can be found in the source code  folder, Chapter 1, with the file name of: chapter1-javascript- behavior.html :  1.	 Continuing on from the previous example, enter the following JavaScript code after   the   tag:   function changeProperties d {     var e = document.getElementById d ;     e.style.position = "absolute";     e.style.fontFamily = "sans-serif";     e.style.backgroundColor = "000000";     e.style.border = "solid 2px black";     e.style.left = "200px";     e.style.color = "ffffff"; } function arrangeList f  {         This is the element whose children we are going to sort      if  typeof f == "string" {    check to see if the element is  "string"         f = document.getElementById f ;      }                 Transfer the element  but not text node  children of e to  a real array      var listElements = [];      for var x = f.firstChild; x != null; x = x.nextSibling           if  x.nodeType == 1 {             listElements.push x ;         }                listElements.sort function n, m  {    .sort is a built in  method of arrays                     var s = n.firstChild.data;                     var t = m.firstChild.data;                     if  s < t {  [ 21 ]   What is JavaScript Testing?                         return -1;                    }                                                else if  s > t {                        return 1;                         }                       else{                        return 0;                       }                   } ;      for var i = 0; i < listElements.length; i++ {         f.appendChild listElements[i] ;       }  } function insertContent a {     var elementToBeInserted = document.getElementById a ;     elementToBeInserted.innerHTML = " This is a dynamic  content   great to be here "; } function changeElementUsingName a {     var n = document.getElementsByName a ;     for var i = 0; i< n.length; i++ {     n[i].setAttribute "style","color:ffffff" ;     } } function hideElement a {     var header = document.getElementById a ;     header.style.visibility = "hidden"; } function hideElementUsingTagName a {     var n = document.getElementsByTagName a ;     for var i = 0; i< n.length; i++ {     n[i].setAttribute "style","visibility:hidden" ;     } }    [ 22 ]   Now save your document and load it in your browser, and you will see an  example similar to the one shown in the next screenshot:  Chapter 1  What just happened? You have just created an HTML document styled with CSS, and applied JavaScript to it.   There are generally no changes to the HTML elements and CSS as compared to the   previous example, but you will see the   elements.  Now you can see the power of JavaScript in action by clicking on the HTML buttons. You  should see that if you click on the change properties button, you will see the HTML box on  the right shifts to the left by 200pixels, and its background change color. You can also click on  other buttons to test their effect on the HTML document.  [ 23 ]   What is JavaScript Testing?  What happens when you click on each HTML button is that you are invoking a JavaScript  function that manipulates the relevant HTML element in the document, via the DOM. You  should see effects like hiding content, creating dynamic content, rearranging the list of items,  and so on.  In the following sections, I'll first start by briefly introducing the JavaScript syntax, followed I'll first start by briefly introducing the JavaScript syntax, followed  by attaching events to HTML elements, and finally using JavaScript's built-in methods to find  HTML elements and manipulating them.  JavaScript Syntax We'll start with learning the basic syntax of JavaScript. Consider the opening   tag:       code omitted    What the above   tag does is identify where JavaScript starts and ends. Within the  type attribute, we write text javascript to denote that this is a JavaScript code.  Now, let us consider the following code snippet:  function arrangeList f  {      if  typeof f == "string" {    check to see if the element is  "string"         f = document.getElementById f ;      }              var listElements = [];  declaring a variable      for var x = f.first�hild; x �= null; x = x.next�ibling  for var x = f.first�hild; x �= null; x = x.next�ibling           if  x.nodeType == 1 {             listElements.push x ;             }                listElements.sort function n, m  {    .sort is a built in method  of arrays                     var s = n.firstChild.data;                     var t = m.firstChild.data;                     if  s < t {                        return -1;                    }                                                   else if  s > t {                        return 1;                         }                       else{                        return 0;                       }                   } ;  [ 24 ]   Chapter 1       for var i = 0; i < listElements.length; i++ {         f.appendChild listElements[i] ;       }  }  The above code snippet shows the function called arrangeList. We define a function by  using the reserved keyword function, followed by the name of the function. Parameters  are passed into the function within the     and in this code snippet, f is the parameter  passed into the function. The function starts with a {and ends with a}.  In short, the function syntax can be defined as follows:  function functionname parameter1, parameter2, … parameterX {     Body of the function }  The second highlighted line shows decision making in JavaScript through the use of the if  statement. The syntax is similar to the C programing if statement. The syntax of JavaScript's  if statement is as follows:  if  condition {     code to be executed if condition is true. }  A variation of the if statement is the if-else  if  condition {     code to be executed if condition is true. } else{     code to be executed if condition is not true. }  We use the keyword var followed by a variable name. In the above example,   var listElements = []; means that a variable listElements is defined, and it   is given the value of an empty list denoted by []. In general, variables can be assigned  arbitrary values since JavaScript is loosely-typed.  Continuing from above, you should see the for loop in action. Its syntax is also similar to the  C language's for loop.  [ 25 ]   What is JavaScript Testing?  If you are new to JavaScript, you may be confused by document.getElementById   and  statements like listElements.push x . What happens in these two lines is that we are  using some of the built-in methods of JavaScript to reference the HTML element with the  corresponding IDs. For now, document.getElementById   will be more important   to you; this will be covered in the section where you learn how to find elements in your   HTML document.  JavaScript events Let's start off by looking at the following code snippet that is found in your JavaScript:   change properties<  button>  Create dynamic content<  button>  Rearrange list   Rearrange unordered list<  button>  hide header 1   Change  hyperlink colors   Hide header 2  using  tag name     The above code snippets show HTML buttons with an event attached to them via onclick.  When the button is clicked, the corresponding JavaScript function is invoked.  For example,  ch ange properties  means that when this button is clicked, the  changeProperties   function is invoked with the parameter boxed1, which   happens to be a div element with the ID boxed1.  Finding elements in a document Remember that we've seen a few built-in methods of JavaScript. JavaScript can be used  to find elements in an HTML document by using some of JavaScript's built-in methods or  properties. After finding the HTML element, you can manipulate its properties. JavaScript  features three properties of the Document object  which is the root of every DOM tree  that  allows you to find the HTML elements that you need. The techniques mentioned here form  the backbone of JavaScript testing. Understanding this section is vital to understanding the   rest of the book. So make sure that you understand this section of the chapter.  [ 26 ]   Firstly, the document.getElementById  . This property allows you to select an HTML  element with a specific ID. document.getElementById  returns only a single element  because the value of every id attribute is  supposed to be  unique. Here's a code snippet  from the example:  Chapter 1  function changeProperties d {     var e = document.getElementById d ;     e.style.position = "absolute"; e.style.position = "absolute";     e.style.fontFamily = "sans-serif";     e.style.backgroundColor = "000000";     e.style.border = "2px solid black";     e.style.left = "200px";    e.style.color = "ffffff"; }  Consider the highlighted line in the above code snippet,   var e = document.getElementById d . What happens here is that the HTML element  'd', which happens to be a parameter of the function changeProperties  , is being  referred. If you look at the source code for this example, you will see an HTML button   with the following:    change properties . Notice that 'boxed1' is being referenced,   and this means that the parameter 'f' takes the value of the HTML element id of   'boxed1'. Therefore, var e = document.getElementById d  means that   the HTML div with the ID of 'boxed1' is being assigned to variable e via the   document.getElementById   method.  Secondly, note the document.getElementsByName   statement. This is similar to  document.getElementById  , but it looks at the name attribute instead of the id  attribute. It returns an array of elements rather than a single element. Consider the   following code snippet:  function changeElementUsingName a {     var n = document.getElementsByName a ;     for var i = 0; i< n.length; i++ {     n[i].setAttribute "style","color:ffffff" ;     } }  What happens here is that the HTML element with the name 'a'  which happens to be a  parameter of the function  is referenced, and because it returns an array of elements, we use  a for loop to loop through the elements, and use the method .setAttribute to change  the color of the text to white. The name attribute applies to   and   tags only.  [ 27 ]   What is JavaScript Testing?  Finally, look at document.getElementsByTagName  . This method looks for HTML  elements by the HTML tag name. For instance, the following code:  function hideElementUsingTagName a {     var n = document.getElementsByTagName a ;     for var i = 0; i< n.length; i++ {     n[i].setAttribute "style","visibility:hidden" ;     } }  finds the HTML element by the tag name, and makes it hidden. In our example, a h2 is used  as a parameter and hence when you click on the relevant button, all text that is enclosed  within the   tags will disappear.  Now, if you change the parameter to div, then you will notice that all of the boxes   will disappear.  Putting it all together Now I'll briefly describe how JavaScript works to interact with HTML elements. Here's what  you will learn in this subsection: after an HTML button is clicked  an event , it invokes a  JavaScript function. Then, the JavaScript function receives a parameter and executes the  function. Consider the following code snippets.  The following code is for an HTML button with an event attached to it:   Create dynamic content<  button>code  Next, the following code is for an HTML div element:      Lastly, the following is code which shows the JavaScript function that is to be invoked:  function insertContent a {     var elementToBeInserted = document.getElementById a ;     elementToBeInserted.innerHTML = " This is a dynamic content<  h1>  great to be here "; }  Now, let me explain what we are trying to do here; after clicking the HTML button, the  JavaScript function insertContent   is invoked. The parameter ''empty' is passed into  is passed into  insertContent  . ''empty'refers to the  refers to the div element with ID ''empty'.  [ 2 ]   Chapter 1  After insertContent   is invoked, the parameter ''empty' is passed to a variable elementToBeInserted, by using document.getElementById  . Then, using the   built-in method innerHTML   for HTML element nodes  because an HTML element node is  passed to the elementToBeInserted variable , we dynamically insert the text " This  is a dynamic content   great to be here ".   is passed to a variable var   Go ahead and open the file in your web browser, and click on the HTML button. You will  notice a new piece of text being inserted into the HTML document, dynamically.  The built-in method innerHTML   for HTML element nodes allows us  to manipulate  or in this case, dynamically insert  HTML contents into  the  HTML node that is using the innerHTML   method. For example, in our  example, we will insert " This is a dynamic content<  h1>  great to be here " into  <  div>. Technically speaking, after the insertion, the end result will be:  :   This is a dynamic content<  h1>  great to be here  .  The difference between JavaScript and server-side   languages  Generally speaking, the main difference between JavaScript and server-side languages lies in  their usage and where they are executed. In modern usage, JavaScript runs on the client side   the users' web browser , and server-side languages runs on servers, and is therefore often  used to read, create, delete, and update databases such as MySQL.  This means that the JavaScript is processed on the web-browser, whereas server-side  languages are executed on web servers.  Server-side languages include ASP.NET, PHP, Python, Perl, and so on.  In the context of modern web development techniques, you have probably heard of Web 2.0  applications. An important technique is that JavaScript is often used extensively to provide  interactivity and to perform asynchronous data retrieval  and in some cases manipulation ,  which is also known as AJAX  which is a short-hand for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML .  JavaScript cannot be used to interact with databases, whereas server-side languages such as  PHP, Python, and JSP can.  JavaScript is also known as front-end, whereas server-side is back-end technology.  [ 2 ]   What is JavaScript Testing?  JavaScript can be used on the server side as well, although it is most  frequently associated with client-side technologies. Although JavaScript is  typically not associated with interacting with databases, this might change  in the future. Consider new browsers such as Google Chrome, which  provides a database API for JavaScript to interact with built-in databases   in the browser itself.  Why pages need to work without JavaScript  Although there are many arguments as to whether we should make web pages work with or  without JavaScript, I personally believe that it depends on how the website or application is  used. But anyway, I'll start off with some of the common reasons for why pages need to work  without JavaScript.  Firstly, not all users have JavaScript enabled in web browsers. This means that users   whose JavaScript is not enabled will not be able to use your application  or features    if it requires JavaScript.  Secondly, if you intend to support your user on their mobile device, then you need to   make sure that your website or application works without JavaScript. The main reason is  because support for JavaScript on mobile devices is often less than satisfactory; if you use  JavaScript, your website or application may not work as well as expected  or worse, fail to  work altogether .  Another way to look at this is based on your understanding of your user base. For instance,  probably the only time when you can afford to ignore users who have JavaScript disabled is  when you can guarantee or know before-hand that your user base has JavaScript enabled.  Such situations can occur when you are developing an application for internal use, and you  know before-hand that all of your users have JavaScript enabled.  In case you are wondering what you can do to create pages that work without JavaScript,  you can check out the idea of graceful degradation. Imagine that you have an application  and the core features of this application are AJAX-based. This means that in order to use  your application, your user will need to have JavaScript enabled. In this case, you would most  probably have to consider making your pages to work without JavaScript in order to ensure  that all of your users can use your application.  [ 30 ]   Chapter 1  What is testing?  Generally speaking, programmers write a program with a few objectives in mind. Besides  creating a program to solve a certain problem or to fulfil a certain demand, other common  objectives would include ensuring that the program is at least correct, efficient, and can be  easily extended.  Of the above-mentioned objectives, correctness is the most important objective—at least in  this book. By correct, we mean that for any given input, we need to make sure that the input  is what we want or need, and that the corresponding output is correct. The implicit meaning  of this is that the program logic is correct: it works the way we intended it to work, there are  no syntax errors, and the variables, objects, and parameters referenced are correct and what  we need.  Take, for instance, a retirement plan calculator written in JavaScript. We could expect the  user to enter values such as their current age, retirement age, and savings per month.  Imagine if a user were to enter incorrect data, such as a string or character. The JavaScript  retirement plan calculator would not work, because the input data is incorrect. Or worse, if  the user entered the correct data and our algorithm for calculating the amount of money to  be set aside for retirement is incorrect, this results in the output being incorrect.  The above errors could be avoided by testing, which is the main topic of this book. In the  remaining portions of this chapter, we will talk about some of the types of errors that you  may face as a JavaScript programmer. But before we move into that, I'll briefly discuss why  we need to test.  Why do you need to test?  First and the foremost, human beings are prone to mistakes. As a programmer, you have  probably made coding mistakes during your programing career. Even the best programmers  on Earth have made mistakes. What makes it worse is that we may not have realized the  mistake until we tested the program.  Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, JavaScript generally fails silently; there are no error  messages to tell you what errors have occurred or where that error has occurred, assuming  you are not using any testing unit or tools to test your JavaScript. Therefore, there is little or  no way to know what has happened to your JavaScript program, if there is an error.  [ 31 ]   What is JavaScript Testing?  In Microsoft's Internet Explorer, you can actually see if you have any JavaScript  errors. You will need to turn on Script Debugging which is found in Tools   Internet Options  Advanced Script Debugging. With Script Debugging turned  on, you will see a yellow 'yield' icon on the bottom left hand corner for IE7 or  IE8 if you have any JavaScript errors. Clicking on that icon will give you a window  where you can click on Show Details to get more information about the error.  Thirdly, even if there are ways to inform you of JavaScript errors, such as enabling Script  Debugging, as mentioned above, there are certain errors that cannot be detected by such  means. For instance, your program syntax may be 100 percent correct, but your algorithm or  program logic might be incorrect. This means that even if your JavaScript can be executed,  your output could be incorrect.  Lastly, testing JavaScript will help you to identify cross-browser compatibility issues. Because  there are approximately five major types of browsers  not accounting for different versions   to support—namely Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Mozilla's Firefox, Google's Chrome,  Apple's Safari and the Opera Web Browser—you will certainly need to test to ensure that  your website or application works across all browsers, because different browsers have  different DOM compatibilities.  Ensuring that the program is correct means confirming and checking that the input is correct,  and then that the output is what we intended it to be.  Types of errors  Before I start introducing the types of JavaScript errors, we need to understand the inner  workings of JavaScript and the web browser. In general, a user requests a web document  from the server, and this document is loaded into the user's web browser. Assuming that  the web document has JavaScript embedded  either via an external JavaScript file or via  inline JavaScript , the JavaScript will be loaded together with the web document  from top  to bottom . As the web document is loaded by the web browser, the JavaScript engine of  the web browser will begin to interpret the JavaScript embedded in the web document. This  process will continue until the JavaScript  and the web document  is completely loaded into  the user's web browser, ready for interaction. Then the user may start to interact with the  web document by clicking on links or buttons that may have JavaScript events attached   to them.  Now, with the above process in mind, we'll start introducing the different types of JavaScript  errors, by using simple examples.  [ 32 ]   Chapter 1  Loading errors The first types of error that we'll discuss are loading errors. Loading errors are errors   that are caught by the JavaScript engine of the web browser as the document is loading.   In other words, loading errors occur before the JavaScript has the opportunity to function.  These errors are typically spotted by JavaScript engines before the code has the chance   to execute.  With the previously-mentioned things in mind, let us now experience how such loading  errors occur.  Time for action – loading errors in action Now we'll see loading errors in action. We do not actually see it, but you will learn about  some of the most common causes for loading errors.  The complete code for this example can be found in the source code folder  Chapter 1, with a file name of chapter1-loading-errors.html  1.  Open up your text editor and create a new document. 2.	 Enter the following code into your document:      JavaScript Errors - Loading Errors       * 1. Loading Errors *    *    Example 1 - syntax errors  var tests = "This is a test";       note two s  document.write test ;       note one s   *    *    Example 2 - syntax errors as the keyword "var" is not used Var Messsage = "This is a test";       note three s's document.write Message ;       note two s's   *    *  [ 33 ]   What is JavaScript Testing?     Example 3 - error caused by using a key word var for = "this is a test"; document.write in ; *         3.	 Now, uncomment the  * and *  wrapped around example 1, save the document  and load it into your browser. You should see a blank page on your web browser.  4.  Repeat the above step for example 2 and example 3. You should see a blank page for   both examples 2 and 3.  What just happened? You have just created an HTML document with erroneous JavaScript code. From the  comments in the code, you should realize that the errors are caused largely due to syntax  errors. And when such errors occur, there is simply no response from the JavaScript in the  web browser.  Some examples of common syntax errors would include missing brackets, missing   semi-colons, and incorrect variable names.  In general, as long as your code is correct in terms of syntax, then you should be able to  avoid loading errors.  Now, you might ask, what happens if only certain parts of the JavaScript code are incorrect?  This would depend on where the error has occurred.  Partially correct JavaScript  In general-JavaScript is executed or loaded from top to bottom. This means that the first line  of code is loaded first, followed by the next, and so on until finally the last line of the code is  loaded. This has important implications for partially-correct JavaScript.  [ 34 ]   Time for action – loading errors in action Now we'll see partially-correct JavaScript code in action and its implications.  Chapter 1  The completed source code for this example can be found in the source  code folder, with the file name Chapter1-loading-errors- modified.html.  1.	 Open your text editor, create a new document, and enter the following code into   your document:     JavaScript Errors - Loading Errors       * 1. Loading Errors - modified  *      this is correct code var tests = "This is a CORRECT test";  document.write tests ;      this is incorrect code. The variable name referred is incorrect var Messsage = "This is a FIRSTtest";  document.write Message ;        this is correct code var testing = "this is a SECOND test"; document.write testing ;         2.  Now save your document and load your document in your web browser. You should   see the text This is a test in your browser.  What just happened? If you trace the code, you should see that the JavaScript executes from top to bottom. It  stops executing when it encounters an error where an incorrect variable name is referenced  by document.write  . Because it stops executing when it encounters an error, the  remaining JavaScript code will not be executed.  [ 35 ]   What is JavaScript Testing?  Things are slightly different if your JavaScript code is organized in terms of functions.   In this situation, functions that have incorrect syntax will fail to execute, whereas  syntactically-correct functions will continue to work, regardless of its order in the code.  By now, you should have a brief understanding of loading errors and how to prevent them by  making sure that your code is syntactically correct.  Now let us move on to the next form of error—runtime errors.  Runtime errors Do you remember how JavaScript is loaded together with the web document into the  browser? After the web document is loaded completely into the web browser, it is ready for  various events, which leads to execution of JavaScript code.  Runtime errors occur during execution; for instance, consider an HTML button that has a  JavaScript event attached to it. Assuming that a JavaScript function is assigned to an event,  then if the JavaScript function has an error, that function will not be executed when the user  clicks on the HTML button.  Other forms of runtime error occur when you misapply an object, variable, or method, or  when you reference objects or variables that do not exist yet.  Time for action – runtime errors in action Now we shall see all three common causes of runtime errors in action.  The code sample is saved in the source code folder of Chapter 1, entitled:  chapter1-runtime-errors.html.  1.  Open up your text editor, enter the following code into a new document:      JavaScript Errors     *  2. Runtime Errors  *   alert  window.innerHTML ;  var Test = "a variable that is defined"; alert Test ;    if variables is wrongly typed, than nothing wil  happen  [ 36 ]   Chapter 1     nothing happens when the user clicks on the HTML button, which  invokes the following function function incorrectFunction  {   alert noSuchVariable ; }     <input type="button" value="click me" onclick="incorrectFunction   "  >       2.	 Save the document and load it into your web browser. 3.	 After loading the document into your browser, you will see two alert boxes: the first   box says undefined and the second alert box says a variable that is defined. Then  you will see an HTML button that says click me.  4.	 Click on the button, and you will see that nothing happens.  What just happened? The first alert that you have seen shows you an error that is caused by misapplying a  method. window.innerHTML does not exist, as .innerHTML is applied to HTML elements  and not to window. The second alert window says that a variable that is defined as the  variable is defined before the alert   references it. Lastly, nothing happens when you click  on the HTML button because the function that is to be invoked has the error of referencing  to a variable that is not defined. Hence it is not executed during the event onclick  .  In this example, you should realize that the logic of your code is of great importance—you  will need to define your variables or objects before using them in your code. Also, make   sure that the method or properties applied are correct. Otherwise, you will end up with a  runtime error.  Now, we'll move on to the last form of JavaScript error—logic errors.  Logic errors Logic errors are difficult to explain. But in general, you can see logic errors as errors that  occur when the code does not work the way that you intend it to. It is much easier to  understand what logic errors are by experiencing them. So, let us take some action.  [ 37 ]   What is JavaScript Testing?  Time for action – logic errors in action In this final example, you will see logic errors.  1.	 Open your text editor, enter the following code into a new document:      JavaScript Errors     * Logic Errors *     saving some input in wrong variables function amountOfMoneySaved amount {     var amountSpent, amountSaved;     amountSpent = amount;    where you really meant amountSaved     var currentAmount = 100;     var totalAmountSaved = currentAmount - amountSpent;     alert "The total amount of money you have now is " +              totalAmountSaved  ;        }  function checkInput amount {          if amount>0 && amount<99          alert "is number" ;     else         alert "NOT number" ; }                an infinite loop for var i = 0; i<10; i-- {     document.write i + " " ; }         You currently have 100 dollars.   The amount of money you have saved is: <input type="text"  id="money" name="money"  >  [ 3 ]   Chapter 1    <input type="submit" value="Submit"         onclick="amountOfMoneySaved moneyForm.money.value "  >        2.	 Now, save the code and open the document in your browser. 3.	 You will see two simple forms. The first form which has the text: You currently   have 100 dollars. The amount of money you have saved is" " followed by an input  box. And the second form contains the text: Checking if you have entered a digit  followed by an input box.  4.	 Now try to enter a number that is larger than 99  say, 999 .  You may have noticed that after entering your input, the total amount of  money appears to have decreased. This is an example of a logic error, where  you are supposed to add the input, but instead the function subtracts the  input. Why did the program not work the way it was intended to?  What just happened? You have just witnessed a simple example of logic error in action. Logic errors can take many  forms. You may have noticed a code snippet in the above example that is commented out.      example 1: infinite loop    example 1: infinite loop for var i = 0; i<10; i-- {     document.write i + " " ; }    This is an example of an infinite for loop. In this loop, you may have noticed that the  statement document.write i+ " ; should be executed  10 times   from var i = 0  to when i = 9  . However, the third expression in the initializer within the for statement is  decreasing  i-- .  As a result, the variable i will never be able to reach the condition where i>10. If you  uncomment the code, you will notice that the statement document.write i" " ;  will continue to execute until the web browser hangs; if you are using Firefox on a Windows  machine, the web browser will hang and you will have to quit the browser by using the   Task Manager.  [ 3 ]   What is JavaScript Testing?  Some advice for writing error-free JavaScript  By now, you should have a brief understanding of the types of JavaScript errors. While we  typically cannot avoid errors, we should try to minimize errors as we write code. In this  section, I'll briefly discuss some of the strategies that you can take, as a beginner JavaScript  programmer, to minimize the amount of errors that can occur.  Always check for proper names of objects, variables, and  functions As seen in the above forms of errors, you should always make sure that you are using the  correct names for your objects, variables, and functions. Because such errors will not be  shown in your web browser, as you write your code, it is always a good idea to check for r code, it is always a good idea to check for  code, it is always a good idea to check for   the correct use of names.  This also includes using unique names for different variables, objects, and functions.  Remember that JavaScript is case-sensitive; therefore do remember to check that you   are using the correct case for your variables, objects, and functions as well.  Check for proper syntax Because you are using JavaScript, at least for this book you should check that you are   using the correct syntax before you run your program. Previously, we went through some   of the key features of the language syntax, for instance, ending each statement with a   semi-colon, using proper and matching brackets, using correct or unique function names,   and so on.  Plan before you code Planning before the actual coding process helps to reduce the possibility of logic errors. This  helps you to think through your program and spot obvious logic errors in your code. Planning  can also help you to check for blind spots, such as missing features or functions.  Check for correctness as you code As you write your program, it is always a good idea to check for errors as you complete  certain portions of the code. For example, if your program consists of six functions, it is  always wise  and less error prone  to check the correctness of each function. Making sure  that each function that you have written is correct before moving to the next function is a  good practice, and can save you a lot of trouble as you write large programs.  [ 40 ]   Chapter 1  Preventing errors by choosing a suitable text editor I personally believe that a suitable text editor  or IDE  is a crucial step in minimizing coding  errors. Notice that I did not say that you need a "good" text editor, but rather a "suitable"  text editor. This is because different programing languages have different features and  different capabilities.  For instance, if you have programmed in Python, you will notice that you do not need to  have the ability to check for matching brackets, because Python is based on code blocks   tabbing or spacing to denote blocks of code . However, in the case of JavaScript, you   would certainly need your text editor to help you check for matching  or missing  brackets.  Some code editors that can accomplish the above includes Dreamweaver  commercial  and  Eclipse  free .  In addition to matching brackets checking, here are some other features that will be useful  for you when you are coding in JavaScript:  1.  Auto-tabbing or spacing after keywords or matching brackets: This will help you in   visually inspecting the code structure, and will minimize code errors.  2.  Auto-complete or auto-suggest feature: This means that as you type your code, the  editor is smart enough to suggest to some of the words  or code  that you have used  in your program so that you can quickly refer to them as you code. This is especially  useful for checking user-defined variables, objects, and functions.  3.  Syntax coloring: This will help you identify if you are misusing any keywords.  Remember runtime errors? Runtime errors can be caused by the misuse of  keywords. If you are using any of the keywords for user-defined variables,   objects, or functions, syntax coloring will help you to identify this.  Summary  Whew, we've covered a lot in this chapter. The bulk of the content covered in this chapter  forms the building blocks of what we need to use in the later chapters. Specifically, we  covered the following topics:        We learnt about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in web pages. In general, HTML provides  the content, CSS styles the web document, and JavaScript provides the behaviour  and interactivity for the webpage. We've also learnt about the syntax of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We've also learnt about the key techniques of using ID and Class selectors in order  for CSS to refer to various HTML elements and perform stylistic operations on the  referenced HTML element.  [ 41 ]   What is JavaScript Testing?          For JavaScript, we learnt about three important techniques for JavaScript to  reference to HTML elements.  These three techniques  or rather built-in methods   are: document.getElementById  , document.getElementsByName  , and  document.ElementsByTagName  . Next we learnt about testing and why we need to test. In general, testing is to  ensure that the program works correctly—that is, for the given input, we have the  correct output. Also, testing helps to uncover syntax errors and confirm that the  program works in the way that we intend it to work. We covered the types of JavaScript errors—namely loading errors, runtime errors,  and logic errors. We've also covered some simple examples of each type of errors  and the common causes of them. We covered some important tips and advice on how to write error-free code.  Now that we have covered the basic building blocks of JavaScript testing, you will see how  we can make use of them to perform ad hoc testing, which we will cover in the next chapter.  You will notice some of the functions and built-in methods used in this chapter will be used  in the next chapter.  [ 42 ]   2  Ad Hoc Testing and Debugging   in JavaScript  In this chapter, we'll formally move into testing the JavaScript programs that we  actually create. But before I start, I'd like to brief you on what you can expect  in this chapter. In this chapter, you will learn about two major ideas—the first  idea being how different browsers can affect JavaScript testing, and the second  major idea being how you can test your JavaScript program by using the alert  .  You will also learn how to access the values on a form, manipulate the values  and finally output the values in a meaningful manner.  You will also see many of the techniques introduced in the previous chapter being   used extensively.  To be more specific, we shall learn about the following topics:                The purpose of ad hoc testing What happens when your browser encounters an error in JavaScript Browser differences and the need to test in multiple browsers Common browser messages and what they mean How to find out if you are getting the right output and putting the right values in the  correct places in your code How to access values on a form and how to access other parts of the web page Tips on what to do when your JavaScript program does not give you the   expected result   Ad Hoc Testing and Debugging in JavaScript            What to do if the script does not run How to perform a visual inspection How to use the alert   to test your JavaScript program Commenting out parts of your code in order to simplify testing Why ad hoc testing isn't always enough  So before I move on to the main topics of this chapter, I'll briefly mention the two basic ideas  that you should understand before moving on to the rest of the chapter.  The purpose of ad hoc testing–getting the script to run  The first basic idea concerns the purpose of ad hoc testing. The main purpose of ad hoc  testing is to quickly get your code up and running and then see if there are any errors with  your code. As mentioned previously, the three different types of JavaScript errors entail  loading, runtime, and logic errors.  The main advantage of ad hoc testing is that it allows you to test your JavaScript program  without bogging you down. It is meant for those who want to save time, especially when  testing small pieces of code.  What happens when the browser encounters an error in  JavaScript  Now it's time for the second basic idea. In the previous chapter, I have briefly described how s time for the second basic idea. In the previous chapter, I have briefly described how ime for the second basic idea. In the previous chapter, I have briefly described how  a web page is loaded in to the browser and then rendered in the web browser, waiting for  interaction with the user. I have also mentioned that, in general, JavaScript fails silently; it  does not explicitly tell or show you what errors  if any  have occurred. This happens when  your browser does not have any form of debugging turned on.  However, modern web browsers feature built-in ways for the browser to tell the user that  some form of errors have occurred on the web page. This happens when you explicitly turn  on or install the debugging tools for the web browser. For some of the browsers, you will also  need to explicitly turn on the error console in order to find out what error has occurred.  [ 44 ]   Chapter 2  In case you are wondering what you need to do in order to make use of these built-in  features, here are some simple instructions to help you to get started:  1.  For Firefox—turn on your web browser and go to Tools. Click on Error Console. 2.  For Internet Explorer—you need to go to you need to go to Tools  Internet Options  Advanced.   Scroll down to Browsing and check Display a notification about every script error.  You now understand the basic ideas about why we perform ad hoc testing. We will   now move on to a more complex topic—how browser differences can affect your   JavaScript program.  Browser differences and the need to test in multiple  browsers  In general, browsers have different features. The one difference that matters the most to us,  at least in this book, is the JavaScript engine used by different browsers. Different JavaScript  engines process JavaScript in different manners. This has important implications for us.  Certain JavaScript functions or methods that are supported by one web browser may   not be supported by another.  The main essence of JavaScript is that it provides behavior to the web page through DOM  manipulation; different browsers have different levels of support for DOM.  We will not attempt to go into a deep discussion about what is supported and what is not  by various browsers. Instead, we'll point you to this website: http:  www.quirksmode. org compatibility.html.  This link provides a summary of the various incompatibilities of various web browsers  according to different selectors. For our purpose here we should be more focused on the  DOM selectors since we are concerned about JavaScript. Feel free to browse through   the website for the details. But for now, the main idea that you need to understand is   that browser differences result in incompatibilities and hence we need to test for   browser compatibility.  Most beginner JavaScript programers would often want to know how they can find out the  browser that their visitors are using. After all, if you can find out what browser your visitors  are using, you'll be able to create compatible JavaScript code. That's true to a large extent;   so now we'll start by learning how we can check the visitor's browser.  [ 45 ]   Ad Hoc Testing and Debugging in JavaScript  Time for action – checking for features and sniffing browsers  In this section, we would like to introduce you to the navigator navigator object. The navigator object is  a built-in object that provides you with information regarding the visitor's browser. What we  are trying to do here is to show you how the navigator object works, and how you can make  programing decisions based on the browser information.  The source code for this example can be found in the source code folder,  Chapter 2, with a file name of browser-testing-sample-1.html  and browser-testing-sample-2.html.  1.  Start your text editor if you have not already done so, and then enter the following   code in your text editor:     Testing for Browser - Example 1         Sample 1 var browserType ="Your Browser Information Is As Follows:\n"; for  var propertyName in navigator {     browserType += propertyName + ": " + navigator[propertyName] +  "\n"; } alert browserType ;        Here's what's happening in the previous code: we defined a variable  browserType. After which we used a for loop and defined another  variable, propertyName.  2.	 The line that says:for  var propertyName in navigator   means that we   are trying to get all of the properties in the navigator object.  3.	 After doing this, we append the propertyName and the information into the  browserType variable. And finally, we output the information in an alert box. 4.  Now, load the file in to your web browser and you should see a pop-up window   containing information about your web browser. Notice that the alert box contains various types of information about your  web browser. You can also access specific property of the browser for your  own use. This is what we are going to do next.  [ 46 ]   Chapter 2  Now that you have learned how to use the navigator object, it's time   to see how we can make use of this information in order to perform  programing decisions:  5.  Create another new document, and enter the following code into it:      Testing for Browser - Example 2         Sample 2 var typeOfBrowser = navigator.appName; document.write typeOfBrowser ; if typeOfBrowser == "Netscape" {     alert "do code for Netscape browsers" ; } else{     alert "do something else" ; }        In the previous sample code, we have defined the variable typeOfBrowser, which is used  to decide which to execute. An easy way would be to use the if else statement to choose  the of code to execute, based on the browser name.  What just happened? In the preceding examples, you have seen how to use the navigator object to perform  "browser sniffing", and based on the given information, perform appropriate actions.  Apart from using the navigator object, you can also test browser differences based on the  browser's capabilities. This means that you can test whether the user's browser has a certain  feature or not. This technique is also known as feature testing. Now, we'll briefly see how  you can perform capability testing.  Testing browser differences via capability testing Capability testing is an important and powerful way to cope with browser incompatibilities.  For instance, you might want to use a certain function that might not be supported on  different browsers. You can include a test to see if this function is supported or not.   Then, based on this information, you can execute the appropriate code for your visitor.  [ 47 ]   Ad Hoc Testing and Debugging in JavaScript  Time for action – capability testing for different browsers In this section, we'll briefly introduce a simple-to-use method that can help you to quickly  test for a certain feature. The method that we are going to use is the .hasFeature    method. Now, we'll dive right in and see it in action..  The source code for this example can be found in the source code folder,  Chapter 2, with a file name of browser-testing-by-feature- 2.html and browser-testing-by-feature.html.  1.  Start your text editor and then enter the following code in your text editor:      Testing browser capabilities using .hasFeature  <  title>      var hasCore = document.implementation.hasFeature "Core","2.0" ; document.write "Availability of Core is "+ hasCore + " " ;  var hasHTML = document.implementation.hasFeature "HTML","2.0" ; document.write "Availability of HTML is "+ hasHTML + " " ;  var hasXML = document.implementation.hasFeature "XML","2.0" ; document.write "Availability of XML is "+ hasXML  + " " ;  var hasStyleSheets = document.implementation.hasFeature "StyleShee ts","2.0" ; document.write "Availability of StyleSheets is "+ hasStyleSheets   + " "  ;  var hasCSS = document.implementation.hasFeature "CSS","2.0" ; document.write "Availability of CSS is "+ hasCSS  + " "  ;  var hasCSS2 = document.implementation.hasFeature "CSS2","2.0" ; document.write "Availability of CSS2 is "+ hasCSS2  + " " ;         [ 4 ]   Chapter 2  To make things clearer, I've defined variables for each of the features and  the version number. In general, the usage of hasFeature is as follows: is as follows: .hasFeature feature, version ;     feature refers to the name of the feature to test in string    version refers to the DOM version to test  2.  Now load the file in to your web browser and you should see various types of text   being created dynamically on the screen. Similarly, you can use the information that you have derived from the user's  browser to perform various decisions in a similar manner as to what you  have seen in the previous example. So, for simplicity and explanation sake, here's how you can perform  programing decisions using the .hasFeature  .  3.  Create another new document, and enter the following code into it:      Testing browser capabilities using .hasFeature   -  Example 2       var hasCore = document.implementation.hasFeature "Core","2.0" ; if hasCore {     document.write "Core is supported, perform code based on the  feature " ; } else{     document.write "Feature is not supported, do alternative code  to enable your program " ; }        The sample code above is self-explanatory as it is similar to the example seen in   browser-testing-sample-2.html.  What just happened? The previous example is a simple extension of what you can do to test for browser  differences. It is similar to the first example, which "sniffs" for the browser information  explicitly, while the method using .hasFeature   is based on capabilities.  [ 4 ]   Ad Hoc Testing and Debugging in JavaScript  There is no right or wrong way to test for browser differences. However, a general practice   is to use .hasFeature   to test for program functionality. That is to say that we often o test for program functionality. That is to say that we often   use .hasFeature   in order to ensure that our JavaScript functionality will be available in order to ensure that our JavaScript functionality will be available   in different browsers.  The previous example shows some of the features that you can test for by using  .hasFeature  . Following is a list of the remaining features that you can test   for by using .hasFeature  :                  Events UI Events Mouse Events HTML Events Mutation Events Range Traversal Views  Now that you have some understanding of how you can test for browser differences, it is ow that you have some understanding of how you can test for browser differences, it is w that you have some understanding of how you can test for browser differences, it is is  time for the next topic—getting the output and putting values in the right places. —getting the output and putting values in the right places. getting the output and putting values in the right places.  the output and putting values in the right places.  and putting values in the right places. the right places.  right places.  Are you getting the correct output and putting values in  the correct places?  In this section, we'll learn how to make sure that we are getting the output and putting the  correct values in the correct places. This means that we need to understand how to use  JavaScript with a HTML form.  Accessing the values on a form In general, "getting" values would generally mean that a user would input some values into a  form  in a HTML document of course , and then our program "gets" the input from the web  form. Also, these values may or may not be manipulated by other functions; the initial user  input may be passed as arguments to other functions and then manipulated.  This can be achieved by using JavaScript's built-in utilities; JavaScript provides a few ways is can be achieved by using JavaScript's built-in utilities; JavaScript provides a few ways  can be achieved by using JavaScript's built-in utilities; JavaScript provides a few ways 's built-in utilities; JavaScript provides a few ways s built-in utilities; JavaScript provides a few ways  for you to access the form values so that you can use these values later on. In general,   the value from a form onsubmit event. " the value from a form JavaScript will "get" the value from a form "get" the value from a form get" the value from a form event.  [ 50 ]   Chapter 2  Time for action – accessing values from a form In the following example, we'll start off with a simple HTML form. You will learn about  various techniques for accessing different form elements. What happens here is that you'll  see how we first submit a form by using the onsubmit event. The onsubmit event allows  us to send the form to a JavaScript function, which then helps us to extract the values from  various form element types. So for this example, I need you to relax and understand the  techniques mentioned earlier.  The source code for this example is found in Chapter 2 of the source  code folder, with a name of accessing-values-from-form.html.  1.  Once again, enter the following code into your newly-created document in your   favorite editor:     Getting Values from a HTML form    * In this example, we'll access form values using  the following syntax:  document.NameOfForm.NameOfElement  where: NameOfForm is the name of corresponding form NameOfElement is the name of the element   within the  corresponding form  *  function checkValues  {     var userInput = document.testingForm.enterText.value;     alert userInput ;     var userInputTextArea = document.testingForm.enterTextArea. value;     alert userInputTextArea ;     var userCheckBox = document.testingForm.clickCheckBox.value;          this is for checkbox     if document.testingForm.clickCheckBox.checked {          userCheckBox = true;     }     else{  [ 51 ]   Ad Hoc Testing and Debugging in JavaScript      userCheckBox = false;      }     alert userCheckBox ;              var userSelectBox = document.testingForm.userSelectBox.value;     alert userSelectBox ;            here's another way you can "loop" through your form  elements     alert document.testingForm.radioType.length ;     for var counter = 0; counter<document.testingForm.radioType. length;counter++ {         if document.testingForm.radioType[counter].checked {             var userRadioButton = document.testingForm. radioType[counter].value;                         alert userRadioButton ;         }     }        }        A simple form showing how values are accessed by JavaScript<  h1>    Enter something in text field:<input type="text"  name="enterText"   >   Enter something in textarea:<textarea rows="2" cols="20"  name="enterTextArea">    Check on the checkbox:<input type="checkbox"  name="clickCheckBox"   >   Select an option:      --NIL--     option1     option2     option3     option4       Select a radio buttons:      Python          JavaScript  [ 52 ]   Chapter 2          Java         PHP          ActionScript 3.0            You should notice that there are various input types, such as text,  textarea, checkbox, select, andand radio.  2.  Save the form and then load it in to your web browser. You should see a simple   HTML form on your screen.  3.  Go on and enter values for the fields, and then click on Submit form. You should see   a series of alert windows, which repeat the values that you have entered. , which repeat the values that you have entered.  which repeat the values that you have entered. that you have entered.  you have entered. you have entered. u have entered.  What just happened? In the simple form example described earlier, you submitted a form via a JavaScript event described earlier, you submitted a form via a JavaScript event , you submitted a form via a JavaScript event  onsubmit. The onsubmit event calls a JavaScript function checkValues   which then  helps us to access the values from different form elements.  In general, the syntax for accessing form elements is as follows:  document.formName.elementName.value  where formName is the name of the form, and elementName refers to the name of   the element.  element.   example, the form name is testingForm, as can be seen in <form   As in the previous example, the form name is  in the previous example, the form name is previous example, the form name is name="testingForm" onsubmit="return checkValues  ">, and the input text element  has the name enterText, as can be seen in  .  Therefore, based on this code snippet, we'll access the form values by doing the following:  document.testingForm.enterText.value  We can then assign this to a variable that can be saved for later use, as shown in the   code example.  [ 53 ]   Ad Hoc Testing and Debugging in JavaScript  've also The previous example should be simple to grasp. But in this short example, I've also previous example should be simple to grasp. But in this short example, I've also  should be simple to grasp. But in this short example, I've also ut in this short example, I've also t in this short example, I've also ve also  introduced a few more useful methods. Consider the following code snippet which is the following code snippet which is  following code snippet which is which is is   found in the example: the example:  example:  for var counter = 0; counter<document.testingForm.radioType. length;counter++ {         if document.testingForm.radioType[counter].checked {             var userRadioButton = document.testingForm. radioType[counter].value;                         alert userRadioButton ;         } }  Notice that in the highlighted line I've made use of the I've made use of the highlighted line I've made use of the  line I've made use of the ve made use of thethe length property; document. testingForm.radioType.length means that I am calculating how many elements by means that I am calculating how many elements by  do I have in the form named testingForm. This property returns the name of radioType do I have in the form named This property returns  an integer that can then be used in loops such as the for loop, as seen in the previous code loop, as seen in the previous code  snippet. You can then loop through form elements and check for their values by using the  method mentioned earlier.  Another important technique that you can use can be found in the following code snippet: important technique that you can use can be found in the following code snippet:  technique that you can use can be found in the following code snippet:  if document.testingForm.click�heckBox.checked {     userCheckBox = true; }  What happens in the highlighted line is that the highlighted line is that  highlighted line is that highlighted line is that checked returns a true oror false. You can use this technique to check if the form You can use this technique to check if the form   element you are referring to has input or not. You can than make use of this information   to perform decisions.   line is that document.testingForm.clickCheckBox. clickCheckBox..  Another technique for accessing form values As you may have noticed, we are accessing the form elements by making use of the name  attribute. We would most probably  and most likely  make use of the name attribute to  access the form elements, as it is easier to refer to those elements. But nonetheless, here's  an alternate method that you can quickly look though:  Instead of writing  You can write this:  document.formName.elementName.value formName.elementName.value .value value  document.forms[integer].elementName.value  where you are making use of the forms object, and elementName refers to the name of   the input.  [ 54 ]   Chapter 2  An example for the preceding code sample would be: preceding code sample would be:  code sample would be:  document.forms[0].enterText.value ocument.forms[0].enterText.value  Notice that the forms object is appended with [0]. This means that the This means that the forms object are  treated similarly to an array; forms[0] refers to the first form in the web page, and so on.  Now that you have understood the basics of accessing the values for a form, you will learn how  to make sure that you are getting the correct values in the correct places in the next section.  Accessing other parts of the web page  other parts of the web page In this section, you will learn how to access other parts of the web page. In general, you have  already learned the building block for accessing different parts of the webpage by making  use of getElementById, getElementsByTag, and getElementsByTagName. Now you  will make further use of these, along with the newly-learned techniques of accessing values  from a form.  Time for action – getting the correct values in the correct places In this example, you will see a general integration of the techniques that you have learned so  far. You will learn how to access form values, manipulate them, perform operations on them,  and finally, put the new output on other parts of the webpage. To help you better visualize  what I am about to describe, following is a screenshot of the completed example:  [ 55 ]   Ad Hoc Testing and Debugging in JavaScript  The example that you are about to use is a simple JavaScript program that checks to see if that you are about to use is a simple JavaScript program that checks to see if  you are about to use is a simple JavaScript program that checks to see if use is a simple JavaScript program that checks to see if  is a simple JavaScript program that checks to see if  you can retire at the age that you want to.

You will be building a form  2 forms in fact, loosely speaking , where the user will be speaking , where the user will be , where the user will be  required to enter basic information into the first form  on the left , and after entering the left , and after entering the information into the first form  on the left , and after entering the  into the first form  on the left , and after entering the  on the left , and after entering the  the left , and after entering the , and after entering the  required information in each field, there will be another input field appearing dynamically   on the right of the field   in the middle of the web page , if the input is correct. the middle of the web page , if the input is correct.  middle of the web page , if the input is correct. middle of the web page , if the input is correct.  of the web page , if the input is correct. , if the input is correct.  if the input is correct.  As you enter the information, a JavaScript event will fire off a JavaScript function that   checks for the correctness of the input. If it is correct, there will be a new field created on  the right-hand side of the field that has just accepted the input, and the field on the left will  be disabled.  After the fields on the left are filled correctly, you will notice a complete form is being  the fields on the left are filled correctly, you will notice a complete form is being  fields on the left are filled correctly, you will notice a complete form is being fields on the left are filled correctly, you will notice a complete form is being  filled correctly, you will notice a complete form is being  filled out in the middle of the page. After you click on on Submit, the code will perform thethe  calculations and determine whether you can retire at the age you have specified, based , based  based   on the amount of money that you require.  The basic requirements for this example are as follows: basic requirements for this example are as follows:  requirements for this example are as follows: for this example are as follows:  this example are as follows:      Correct values must be entered. For instance, if the field requires you to enter your  age, the field must only accept integers and no characters should be allowed. If the fields require a text input, such as your name, no integers will be allowed.  The completed source code for this example can be found in the source  code folder for Chapter 2, with a file name of a file name of  file name of getting-values-in- right-places.html.  So now, let us get started with this example::  1.  Let us start by building the basic interface for this example.

You might want to save this file and load it in your browser to see if you are getting   the same output as the previous screenshot that you have seen. Notice that in the HTML form above, there is JavaScript event onblur.  onblur is a JavaScript event that occurs whenever an element loses focus.  So you should see that all input elements have an onblur, which fires off  the submitValues   function. You should also see that there is a this as an argument for  submitValues  .this is one of the most powerful JavaScript keywords,  and refers to the corresponding element it is being referred to. An  example would be <input type="text" name="enterText"  id="nameOfPerson" onblur="submitValues this "  size="50"  value="Enter your name" >. In this code snippet,  submitValues this  will submit the HTML form element object by the  name of enterText. Now, it's time for the JavaScript programing. What happened, as explained  previously, is that on the JavaScript event onblur, it will submit the HTML  form element object to the function submitValues  . So, we'll start with  this function first.  [ 5 ]   Ad Hoc Testing and Debugging in JavaScript  3.  Now, enter the following code between the     tags:: function submitValues elementObj {        using regular expressions here to check for digits     var digits =  ^\d+$ .test elementObj.value ;         using regular expressions         here to check for characters which         includes spaces as well     var letters =   ^[a-zA-Z\s]*$ .test elementObj.value ;         check to see if the input is empty     if elementObj.value=="" {         alert "input is empty" ;         return false;     }        input is not relevant; we need a digit for input elements  with name "enterNumber"     else if elementObj.name == "enterNumber" && digits == false {         alert "the input must be a digit!" ;         return false;     }        input is not relevant; we need a digit for input elements  with name "enterNumber"     else if elementObj.name == "enterText" && letters == false {         alert "the input must be characters only!" ;         return false;     }        theinput seems to have no problem, so we'll process the  input     else{         elementObj.disabled = true;         addResponseElement elementObj.value,elementObj.id ;         return true;              }         } I've commented on what the code is doing, but I'll focus on some of the ve commented on what the code is doing, but I'll focus on some of the on what the code is doing, but I'll focus on some of the  what the code is doing, but I'll focus on some of the the code is doing, but I'll focus on some of the  code is doing, but I'll focus on some of the I'll focus on some of the ll focus on some of the  techniques used in the previous function. previous function.  function. What we are trying to do here is to check the correctness of the input. the correctness of the input.  correctness of the input. the input.  input.  For this example, we only accept either pure numbers or pure characters   including spaces . This is what the following code snippet is doing: var digits =  ^\d+$ .test elementObj.value ; var characters =   ^[a-zA-Z\s]*$ .test elementObj.value ;  [ 60 ]   Chapter 2  Here we are making use of regular expressions to check for the correctness  of the input.  ^\d+$  and  ^[a-zA-Z\s]*$  are regular expressions,  where both are appended with the test method. The test method tests  for the value of the HTML form object's value. For instance, var digits   =   ^\d+$ .test elementObj.value  will return true if the value   is indeed digits, and false if it is not. Similarly, var characters =     ^[a-zA-Z\s]*$ .test elementObj.value  will return true if   it is characters  which includes spaces  and false if it is otherwise. In case you wish to learn more about using regular expressions, you can  refer to http:  www.w3schools.com jsref jsref_obj_regexp. asp and see how it works. The previous information will be used during the decision-making process  in if-else statements. The if-else statements check for the name  of the HTML object; enterNumber expects an integer input. If it is not  enterNumber, it is expecting a character input. You should notice that if there are no problems with the input, we   will disable the input element and pass the value and id of the HTML   form object to a function addResponseElement  , after which we will   return true, which signifies the successful execution of the code and   the submission of the form values. So now, we'll move on to the addResponseElement  function:  4.  Continuing with the current document, append the following code below current document, append the following code below  document, append the following code below the following code below  following code below  submitValues   function: function:: function addResponseElement messageValue, idName {     globalCounter++;     var totalInputElements = document.testForm.length;     var container = document.getElementById 'formSubmit' ;     container.innerHTML += "<input type=\"text\" value=\""  +messageValue+ "\"name=\""+idName+"\"  > ";     if globalCounter == totalInputElements {         container.innerHTML += "<input type=\"submit\" value=\ "Submit\"  >";     }} }  [ 61 ]   Ad Hoc Testing and Debugging in JavaScript  What addResponseElement   does is that it attempts to dynamically add  the input element on the form to the right of original input form. Here, you  should find var container = document.getElementById 'formSu bmit'  familiar. It looks for an HTML element with ID of formSubmit. After  this, we will append HTML into this form, through the innerHTML method.  container.innerHTML += "<input type=\"text\" value=\""  +messageValue+ "\"name=\""+idName+"\"  > "; attempts to  append the input that is wrapped between the outermost inverted commas  into   tags. You should also notice var totalInputElements = document. testForm.length;. What this line of code does is determine the total  number of input elements that testForm has, by using the length  property. We are making use of this information to determine if we are on  the last input field of the form, so that we can append a Submit button on  the other form. Next, we will create the function, which is called after the second form,  which has a name of testFormResponse, is submitted.  5.  Continuing with the current document, append the following code below  document, append the following code below current document, append the following code below the following code below  following code below  addResponseElement     function: function:: function checkForm formObj {     var totalInputElements = document.testFormResponse.length;         var nameOfPerson = document.testFormResponse.nameOfPerson. value;     var birth = document.testFormResponse.birth.value;     var age = document.testFormResponse.age.value;       var spending = document.testFormResponse.spending.value;     var salary = document.testFormResponse.salary.value;      var retire = document.testFormResponse.retire.value;     var retirementMoney = document.testFormResponse. retirementMoney.value;     var confirmedSavingsByRetirement;     var ageDifference = retire - age;    how much more time can  the user have to prepare for retirement     var salaryPerYear = salary * 12;    salary per year     var spendingPerYear = spending * 12;    salary per year             income per year, can be negative        if negative means cannot retire        need to either increase spending        or decrease spending     var incomeDifference = salaryPerYear - spendingPerYear;  [ 62 ]   Chapter 2      if incomeDifference <= 0 {         buildFinalResponse nameOfPerson,-1,-1,- 1,incomeDifference ;         return true;     }     else{            income is positive, and there is chance of retirement         confirmedSavingsByRetirement = incomeDifference *  ageDifference;         if confirmedSavingsByRetirement <= retirementMoney {             var shortChange = retirementMoney -  confirmedSavingsByRetirement;             var yearsNeeded = shortChange 12;  buildFinalResponse nameOfPerson,false,yearsNeeded,retire,  shortChange ;             return true;         }         else{             var excessMoney = confirmedSavingsByRetirement -  retirementMoney;             buildFinalResponse name,true,-1,retire,excessMoney ;             return true;         }     } }  What happens in this function is pretty straightforward. The various form  values are assigned to the various variables. Then we begin some simple  calculations to see if the user will have enough money for retirement.   You may refer to the comments in the function to understand the logic   of the calculations. In general, we'll call the function buildFinalResponse  , irrespective  of whether the user can retire on time, and with the required amount of  money. So here's the buildFinalResponse  . Continuing with the current document, append the following code below  checkForm    function: function buildFinalResponse name,retiring,yearsNeeded,retire,  shortChange {     var element = document.getElementById "finalResponse" ;     if retiring == false {         element.innerHTML += " Hi  " + name + " , ";         element.innerHTML += " We've processed your information  and we have noticed a problem. ";  [ 63 ]   Ad Hoc Testing and Debugging in JavaScript          element.innerHTML += " Base on your current spending  habits, you will not be able to retire by  " + retire + "    years old. ";         element.innerHTML += " You need to make another  " +  shortChange + "  dollars before you retire inorder to acheive  our goal ";         element.innerHTML += " You either have to increase your  income or decrease your spending. ";     }      *     else if retiring == -1 {         element.innerHTML += " Hi  " + name + " , ";         element.innerHTML += " We've processed your information  and we have noticed HUGE problem. ";         element.innerHTML += " Base on your current spending  habits, you will not be able to retire by  " + retire + "    years old. ";         element.innerHTML += " This is because you spend more  money than you make. You spend  " + shortChange + "  in  excess of what you make ";         element.innerHTML += " You either have to increase your  income or decrease your spending. ";     }     *      else{            able to retire but....               element.innerHTML += " Hi  " + name + " , ";         element.innerHTML += " We've processed your information  and are pleased to announce that you will be able to retire on  time. ";         element.innerHTML += " Base on your current spending  habits, you will be able to retire by  " + retire + "  years  old. ";         element.innerHTML += " Also, you'll have '  " +  shortChange + "  amount of excess cash when you retire. ";         element.innerHTML += " Congrats! ";     } }  The function buildFinalResponse     is similar to the addResponseElement     function. It simply looks for the required HTML element, and appends the required It simply looks for the required HTML element, and appends the required  the required HTML element, and appends the required  required HTML element, and appends the required s the required  the required   HTML to the element.  , you can clearly see the JavaScript functions, methods, and techniques that you have Here, you can clearly see the JavaScript functions, methods, and techniques that you have  you can clearly see the JavaScript functions, methods, and techniques that you have , and techniques that you have  and techniques that you have  learnt so far in this book. nt so far in this book.  so far in this book.

[ 64 ]   Chapter 2  What just happened? In the previous example, you saw how to access the values of the form, perform operations  on the input, and then place the output on various parts of the web page. You may have  noticed that we made extensive use of getElementById. We have also made use of the  form object and the value method in order to access the value of various elements in the  form. Then, by making use of getElementById, we looked for the required HTML element  and appended the output into the HTML element.  But, at this point of time, you may be wondering what you should do if you happen to make  mistakes in the program. This is what we'll be focusing on in the next section.  Does the script give the expected result?  My opinion is that before we can begin any meaningful discussion, we must understand meaningful discussion, we must understand  discussion, we must understand  what is meant by "expected result". is meant by "expected result".  by "expected result".

A simple tip, to check if the script gives you the expected results, is to use simple input and , to check if the script gives you the expected results, is to use simple input and  to check if the script gives you the expected results, is to use simple input and the expected results, is to use simple input and  expected results, is to use simple input and results, is to use simple input and  to use simple input and  perform the calculations yourself. Make sure that your calculations are correct and test   your program.  In the later part of this chapter, we'll discuss two relevant techniques in detail. But first, let  us see what actions we can take if our script does not run.  What to do if the script doesn't run   errors have occurred, If the script doesn't run, it is very likely that loading or runtime errors have occurred, doesn't run, it is very likely that loading or runtime errors have occurred,  run, it is very likely that loading or runtime errors have occurred, loading or runtime errors have occurred,  or runtime errors have occurred, runtime errors have occurred, occurred,,  depending on the way that your program is coded. For example, in the previous program , in the previous program  in the previous program the previous program  previous program previous program  program  that you have just created, you know that the program is not running if there is no response  after you have entered the first input field and the focus is no longer on the first input field.

Whatever the errors may be, it is often difficult to guess what and where the errors are.  Therefore, I'll introduce three important techniques for testing out your code, if your code  does not run.  Visually inspecting the code Visually inspecting the code means that you will be a human compiler, and visually check   for errors in your code. My opinion is that there are certain pre-conditions and tips for conditions and tips for  tips for   visual inspection:          There must be a good code block structure. This means that code should be properly  spaced and indented for visual clarity. At one glance, you should be able to see which  code is nested under which if-else statements, or which functions it belongs to. The code editor that you use makes a huge difference. A common error is the  mismatching of brackets or inverted commas. Therefore, a code editor that   allows for the highlighting of matching brackets will help you to spot such errors. Check for semicolons after each statement s . Check to see if variables are initialized. If variables are used in later parts of the  program but are not initialized, it will create serious errors.  The previous actions are some of the things I will do if my script doesn't run or if it doesn't previous actions are some of the things I will do if my script doesn't run or if it doesn't  actions are some of the things I will do if my script doesn't run or if it doesn't script doesn't run or if it doesn't  doesn't run or if it doesn't doesn't run or if it doesn't  run or if it doesn't doesn't  run in the way that I intend it to.

However, despite our best intentions, visual inspection of  code can only be useful for small programs, such as programs that have less than 30 to 50  lines of code. If the programs get any larger, or if they contain various functions that are  invoked during events, it might be better  and more efficient  to check our code by using t might be better  and more efficient  to check our code by using  might be better  and more efficient  to check our code by using  and more efficient  to check our code by using  more efficient  to check our code by using efficient  to check our code by using  to check our code by using   the alert function. function.  Using alert   to see what code is running The alert method can be used to check that what code is running is being used  appropriately. We have not formally introduced the alert method yet. But just in case, you  can use the alert function to create pop-up windows just about anywhere in a JavaScript a JavaScript  program. The syntax is as follows:  The syntax is as follows:  alert message   where message can take almost any number of values  or variables if it has been defined number of values  or variables if it has been defined values  or variables if it has been defined  or initialized . Due to this flexible nature of the  nature of the alert method, it can also be used to show  initialized . Due to this flexible nature of the  . Due to this flexible nature of the flexible nature of the values, strings, and object types as well.  and object types as well.  object types as well.  [ 66 ]   Chapter 2  The issue in using alert stems from the location where the alert should be placed in the  code. This will be demonstrated in the next hands-on example.  Using alert   to see what values are being used As mentioned earlier, the alert method can be used to show almost any type of value.  Therefore, a common usage would be to pass a variable into the alert method and see if  the value is what we need or intended.  Similarly, we need to know where we should be applying the alert method to in order to  ensure that our code inspection is correct.  At this point of time, an example would be the most appropriate way to see how we can  make use of the alert method to inspect the code for errors. So, let us see how this works.  Time for action – using alert to inspect your code This example is similar to what you have done in the previous example. In this example, you  will be required to insert alert in the appropriate places in order to check which part of the  code is running. In some cases, you will need to pass values to the alert method and see if  the value is the one that you want.  To be honest, it would be tedious to tell you step-by-step where you should place the alert  method, especially as the bulk of the code in this example is similar to the previous one.  However, to make things easier for you to follow, we'll start immediately with the entire  program, after which we'll explain to you the rationale behind the location of the alert  methods and the values that are passed into the alert method.  The source code of the following example can be found in Chapter 2 of  the source code folder, named getting-values-in-right-places- using-alert.html.  1.  This example is similar to the previous one, except that the JavaScript has been   changed slightly. Replace the JavaScript code from the previous example with the  following code: var globalCounter = 0; function submitValues elementObj {     alert "submitValues" ;     alert elementObj.name ;     var totalInputElements = document.testForm.length;     alert "total elements: " + totalInputElements ;           var digits =  ^\d+$ .test elementObj.value ;     var characters =   ^[a-zA-Z\s]*$ .test elementObj.value ;  [ 67 ]   Ad Hoc Testing and Debugging in JavaScript      alert characters ;     if elementObj.value=="" {         alert "input is empty" ;         return false;     }     else if elementObj.name == "enterNumber" && digits == false {         alert "the input must be a digit!" ;         return false;     }     else if elementObj.name == "enterText" && characters ==  false {         alert "the input must be characters only!" ;         return false;     }     else{         alert "you've entered : " + elementObj.value ;         elementObj.disabled = true;         alert elementObj.value ;         addResponseElement elementObj.value,elementObj.id ;         return true;              }         }  function addResponseElement messageValue, idName {     alert "addResponseElement" ;     globalCounter++;     var totalInputElements = document.testForm.length;     alert "totalInputElements" ;     var container = document.getElementById 'formSubmit' ;     container.innerHTML += "<input type=\"text\" value=\""  +messageValue+ "\"name=\""+idName+"\"  > ";     if globalCounter == totalInputElements {         container.innerHTML += "<input type=\"submit\" value=\ "Submit\"  >";     } }  function checkForm formObj {     alert "checkForm" ;          var totalInputElements = document.testFormResponse.length;     alert totalInputElements ;  [ 6 ]   Chapter 2      var nameOfPerson = document.testFormResponse.nameOfPerson. value;     alert nameOfPerson ;          var birth = document.testFormResponse.birth.value;     alert birth ;          var age = document.testFormResponse.age.value;     alert age ;          var spending = document.testFormResponse.spending.value;     alert spending ;          var salary = document.testFormResponse.salary.value;     alert salary ;          var retire = document.testFormResponse.retire.value;     alert retire ;          var retirementMoney = document.testFormResponse. retirementMoney.value;     alert retirementMoney ;          var confirmedSavingsByRetirement;          var ageDifference = retire - age;    how much more time can  the user have to prepare for retirement     alert ageDifference ;     var salaryPerYear = salary * 12;    salary per year     alert salaryPerYear ;     var spendingPerYear = spending * 12;    salary per year     alert spendingPerYear ;          var incomeDifference = salaryPerYear - spendingPerYear;     alert incomeDifference ;          if incomeDifference <= 0 {         buildFinalResponse nameOfPerson,-1,-1,- 1,incomeDifference ;         return true;     }     else{         confirmedSavingsByRetirement = incomeDifference *  ageDifference;         if confirmedSavingsByRetirement <= retirementMoney {  [ 6 ]   Ad Hoc Testing and Debugging in JavaScript              var shortChange = retirementMoney -  confirmedSavingsByRetirement;             alert shortChange ;             var yearsNeeded = shortChange 12;              buildFinalResponse nameOfPerson,false,yearsNeeded,retire,  shortChange ;             return true;         }         else{             var excessMoney = confirmedSavingsByRetirement -  retirementMoney;             alert excessMoney ;             buildFinalResponse name,true,-1,retire,excessMoney ;             return true;         }     } }  function buildFinalResponse name,retiring,yearsNeeded,retire,  shortChange {     alert "buildFinalResponse" ;          var element = document.getElementById "finalResponse" ;     if retiring == false {         alert "if retiring == false" ;         element.innerHTML += " Hi  " + name + " , ";         element.innerHTML += " We've processed your information  and we have noticed a problem. ";         element.innerHTML += " Base on your current spending  habits, you will not be able to retire by  " + retire + "    years old.

";         element.innerHTML += " Base on your current spending  habits, you will be able to retire by  " + retire + "  years  old. ";         element.innerHTML += " Also, you'll have  " +  shortChange + "  amount of excess cash when you retire. ";         element.innerHTML += " Congrats! ";     }} }  2.  Save the document and load it in to your web browser. Play around with the  example and see how the alert boxes notify you of which part of the code is   being executed, and also the values being entered.  What just happened? If you go through the previous example, you will notice that the alert   is most often  placed at the beginning of functions, and when variables are being initialized. To check the  functions, we often manually type in the name of the function and pass it as arguments  to the alert method, to inform us of what is happening as we interact with the program.  Similarly, we pass the variables that are defined  the values from the form elements  as  arguments to the alert method to inform us of what values are being entered by the user.  Therefore, by using a single alert   method, we are able to find out what code is running  and what values are being used. However, this method may be slightly too tedious or  frustrating, because the alert boxes keep on popping up on your window. Here's a simple  alternative for checking what code is running, and also to inspect the input elements.  A less obtrusive way to check what code is running and the  values used To test our code in a less obtrusive manner we would write a simple debugging function. This  debugging function should print out the names of the functions, and some other variables.  For simplicity's sake, we'll demonstrate a simple debugging function that prints the name of  the function, and the HTML element being used. So, let us get started.  [ 71 ]   Ad Hoc Testing and Debugging in JavaScript  Time for action – unobtrusively checking what values are used As mentioned above, we'll be demonstrating a very simple debugging function that helps  you to identify which code is running and also which HTML element is in use. Here, you'll  get a basic idea of some of the actions that you can perform in order to have a less obtrusive  way of testing your code.  Again, this example is similar to the previous one, but there are some important elements  that which we will be adding to the previous example. In essence, we will be adding a  function, some HTML, and CSS to it.  However, you might find it tedious to refer back to the previous example and add the new  elements to the previous example. Therefore, it is recommended that you stay with me on  this example.  Alternatively, you can view the source code in the source code folder,  Chapter 2, with a file name of getting-value-in-right- places-complete.html.  So, without further ado, let us start right now:  1.  Insert the following CSS code in between the   tags:   * this is for debugging messages *  debugging{     float:left;     margin-left:820px;     height:95%;     width:350px;     border:solid 3px red;     padding:5px;     color:red;     font-size:10px; }  2.  Now, for the HTML container which will contain the debugging messages, enter the  enter the enter the the      following code snippet before   tag:   Debugging messages:    What happens here is that the preceding HTML element will be used to the preceding HTML element will be used to  between the debugging messages and thethe  provide a visual separation between the debugging messages and the application itself. Save the file now , load it to your web browser and simple application itself. Save the file now , load it to your web browser and ave the file now , load it to your web browser and ve the file now , load it to your web browser and   itself. Save the file now , load it to your web browser and you will see an example similar to the one shown in the next screenshot:  see an example similar to the one shown in the next screenshot: will see an example similar to the one shown in the next screenshot: next screenshot::  [ 72 ]   Chapter 2  3.  Next, you will need to append the following code to your JavaScript code:  function debuggingMessages functionName, objectCalled, message {     var elementName;     if objectCalled.name {         elementName = objectCalled.name;     }     else if objectCalled.id {         elementName = objectCalled.id;     }     else{         elementName = message;     }           var element = document.getElementById "debugging" ;          element.innerHTML += "Function name :" +functionName+  " element :" +elementName+" "; }  The previously-mentioned function is used to capture the name of the previously-mentioned function is used to capture the name of the  function is used to capture the name of the the name of the  name of the  function used right now; this is equivalent to what code is in use right now,,  because our program is event driven and the functions are, in general, , in general,  in general,,  triggered by the user.  [ 73 ]   Ad Hoc Testing and Debugging in JavaScript  The three arguments are as follows:        functionName refers to the functionName of the function used right refers to the functionName of the function used right the function used right  function used right   now. In the next step, you shall see the method used to derive this   value dynamically. objectCalled refers to the HTML object being used. Message refers to a string. This can be any message that you want; it is  meant to provide some form of flexibility to the kind of debugging messages  that you can write to the screen.  Also, we are making use of the .innerHTML method messages into the HTML div element for the  for the the id "debugging". "debugging". debugging".  ethod to append the   4.  Now finally, it's time to see how we can use this function. In general, we use the      function as follows: debuggingMessages "name of function", elementObj,"empty" ; name of function", elementObj,"empty" ; ", elementObj,"empty" ; If you refer to the source code, you will see that the previously-mentioned will see that the previously-mentioned  see that the previously-mentioned  that the previously-mentioned  the previously-mentioned previously-mentioned  function is being used sparingly in the program. Consider the following   code snippet: function submitValues elementObj {       alert "submitValues" ;          debuggingMessages "submit�alues"�� element�b���"empty" ; submit�alues"�� element�b���"empty" ; "�� element�b���"empty" ;       alert elementObj.name ;     var totalInputElements = document.testForm.length;       alert "total elements: " + totalInputElements ; In the previous case, the value of previous case, the value of because submitValues is the name of the function. Notice that we also  passed the function argument, elementObj intonto debuggingMessages    in order to notify us what is being used in the current function. n order to notify us what is being used in the current function. the current function.  current function.   will be passed  case, the value of "submitValues" will e passed  " will submitValues" will  5.  Finally, you might want to add the debuggingMessages "name of function", name of function",",  elementObj,"empty"  to each function in your JavaScript program. If you are not o each function in your JavaScript program. If you are not  sure where you should use this function, refer to the source code given. If you are typing in the function yourself, then do take note that you might en do take note that you might n do take note that you might  have to change the argument names in order to accommodate each of accommodate each of  each ofof  functions. In general, debuggingMessages   can be used in place  the functions. In general, of the alert   lert   method.

You have just created a function that allows you to inspect your code in a less obtrusive  manner, by making use of some built-in methods of JavaScript, which includes the  .innerHTML method. What happens here is another example of how you can access values,  manipulate them, and then output these values to the required HTML element, in order to  make inspection less obtrusive.  If you look through the source code, you may have noticed that I used different messages  during different situations; this will bring more flexibility to your debugging functions, if you  use one.  Commenting out parts of the script to simplify testing  Commenting out parts of the script is another important and simple-to-use ad hoc technique -to-use ad hoc technique to-use ad hoc technique -use ad hoc technique use ad hoc technique  for testing your JavaScript code. Essentially, you comment out the code that will not be  your JavaScript code. Essentially, you comment out the code that will not be   used immediately.  [ 75 ]   Ad Hoc Testing and Debugging in JavaScript  Because we have not introduced how to do multiple line commenting, I'll take this chance to I'll take this chance to ll take this chance to  show you how to use it. The syntax is as follows: it. The syntax is as follows:  The syntax is as follows:   * This is a multiple line comment *   Here's how commenting out parts of the script can be used to simplify testing: we  would often comment out all other code that we would not use at first. For instance,  the first function used in getting-values-right-places-complete.html is the  submitValues   function.  We would make sure that the submitValues   function is correct before uncommenting function is correct before uncommenting  the second function that is used, which is the second function that is used, which is the   function that is used, which is the addResponseElement   function. function.  The process goes on until all functions are uncommented, which means that the code   is correct.  With all of these points in mind, we'll now move on to a simple workout based on the  all of these points in mind, we'll now move on to a simple workout based on the  of these points in mind, we'll now move on to a simple workout based on the se points in mind, we'll now move on to a simple workout based on the  points in mind, we'll now move on to a simple workout based on the points in mind, we'll now move on to a simple workout based on the in mind, we'll now move on to a simple workout based on the 'll now move on to a simple workout based on the ll now move on to a simple workout based on the n the the   previous example.  example.  Time for action – simplifying the checking process In this example, there will not be any source code for you to copy. Instead, you can use the  previous example found in getting-values-right-places-complete.html and try  out the following steps:  1.  Scroll to the JavaScript section of the source code. Comment out all functions except   for submitValues   and addResponseElement  .  2.  Save the file and load it to your web browser. Now test out the program. You should notice that your program can still work, except that after all   the input fields are filled correctly, you will not be able to submit the   form successfully. This is because you have commented out the function checkForm  ,  which is needed for the second form submission. What does this mean? This means to say that the functions  submitValues  and addResponseElement   work correctly,   and now it is safe to move on.  3.  Now, uncomment the checkForm  , buildFinalResponse    , and   debuggingMessages   function, save the file and reload in your browser.  Continue to test out your program until you submit the form. ontinue to test out your program until you submit the form. ntinue to test out your program until you submit the form.  [ 76 ]   Chapter 2  You should have noticed that all things go well before the submission of   the second form. This is, because expected as you have tested it in thethe  previous step. Now, after you have completed all of the input fields, submit the  form. Because you have uncommented thethe checkForm   andnd  buildFinalResponse     functions, you should now expect a   response after submitting the form.  4.  Finally, uncomment the debuggingMessages     function. Save the file and load it   in to your browser  Now, similarly, use the program as usual, and you should see that all of the required  functionalities are working as before.  What just happened? You have just executed a useful way of testing your code by uncommenting different parts  of the code. You may have noticed that we started from the first function that will be used,  and then proceeded to the next one. This process will help us to spot the block of code that  contains the error.  This technique can also be applied to code statements. We commented out the code in  functions, because it is easier to follow based on the example.  Timing differences–making sure that the HTML is there  before interacting with it  Remember that the essence of JavaScript is to provide behavior to web pages by  manipulating DOM elements? Here's the catch—if the HTML is not available when, for  instance, a JavaScript function that changes the color of a form is executed, then the   JavaScript function will not work.  In this case, it is not due to JavaScript errors such as logic, runtime, and loading errors, but  rather, due to timing problems.  As mentioned in the previous chapter, the web browser  client  downloads a web page  from a server, and in general, reads the web page  document  from top to bottom. So, for  instance, if you have a large HTML document  for instance an HTML document with large  images within the body , your JavaScript might not be able to interact with the HTML DOM  because there is no HTML to interact with.  [ 77 ]   Ad Hoc Testing and Debugging in JavaScript  There are two solutions that allow us to deal with this problem: are two solutions that allow us to deal with this problem:  two solutions that allow us to deal with this problem:  1.  Using the JavaScript event onload with the   tag. This can be done    as follows:       function aSimpleFunction   {     alert window.status ; }            contents in thethe   tag have finished loading. You can make ve finished loading.

You can make   The highlighted line means that aSimpleFunction   is executed only executed only  only  when the contents in the use of this technique to ensure that your HTML contents have finished ve finished  finished  loading before you execute your JavaScript functions. Here's another  and possibly preferred method : 's another  and possibly preferred method : s another  and possibly preferred method :  2.  Placing your JavaScript function before the   tag.  This method is commonly used; you can see companies providing analytics service often  requesting its users to place the tracking code  often in JavaScript, such as Google Analytics   just before the   tag. This means that the JavaScript snippet will be loaded after all  contents in the   tag are loaded, ensuring that the HTML DOM will interact with the  JavaScript.  Why ad hoc testing is never enough  Up to this point, you may have noticed that the methods introduced for ad hoc testing can  get repetitive when applied to your code. For instance, the alert method requires you  to manually type in the alert function in different parts of the code, containing different  values in order for you to inspect the code. This can get tedious and inefficient, especially inefficient, especially , especially  when the program begins to get larger. Simply put, it will not be able to scale when the the program begins to get larger. Simply put, it will not be able to scale when the  program begins to get larger. Simply put, it will not be able to scale when the  program gets too large. At the same time, the alert method can be quite obtrusive. For  this reason, we created a simple debugging function.  [ 7 ]   Chapter 2  The simple debugging function that we have created is less obtrusive; you can interact with  the program and receive an almost instant feedback on your screen. Although it has the  advantage of being less obtrusive, it suffers from two major disadvantages. The first is the  fact that it can be tedious and inefficient, which is similar to the alert method. The second  disadvantage is that how well the debugging function can work relies largely on the skills of  the JavaScript program. However, being beginners in JavaScript, we may or may not have the  skills to create a robust debugging function.  Therefore, there are other, more powerful, tools to help us get the job done when the need  arises, and we will be discussing these in the later chapters.  Summary  In this chapter, we built upon the basics learnt in the previous chapter, and expanded   our knowledge of how we can perform ad hoc testing by using various techniques covered   in the chapter.  In general, we have combined the various methods and techniques from the previous  chapter and this chapter in order to help us perform ad hoc testing. We often look for   the required element through getElementById, and then by accessing form values  through the form object. We also used the alert   method to perform some form   of ad hoc testing.  Specifically, we have covered the following topics:            t how to access values on forms by using the We have learnt how to access values on forms by using the  how to access values on forms by using the form object and its   values in to other parts  methods, manipulating the values, and outputting the values in to other parts the values in to other parts of the web page by using the techniques learnt in the previous chapter, such as t in the previous chapter, such as  in the previous chapter, such as  the previous chapter, such as  such as  getElementById.

The difference between validating and testing  There's a thin line separating validating and testing. If you have some idea about sets  as in separating validating and testing. If you have some idea about sets  as in  validating and testing. If you have some idea about sets  as in  sets from mathematics , I would say that validation can lead to better testing results, while  testing does not necessarily lead to a valid code. necessarily lead to a valid code.  lead to a valid code. a valid code. valid code.  Let us consider the scenario—you wrote a JavaScript program and tested it on major the scenario—you wrote a JavaScript program and tested it on major  scenario—you wrote a JavaScript program and tested it on major —you wrote a JavaScript program and tested it on major you wrote a JavaScript program and tested it on major  browsers such as the Internet Explorer and Firefox; and it worked.

In this case, you have  tested the code to make sure that it is functional.  However, the same code that you have created may or may not be valid; valid code is akin to  writing a code that has the following characteristics: a code that has the following characteristics: code that has the following characteristics: the following characteristics:  following characteristics::        Well formed ell formed Has good coding style  such as proper indentation, well-commented code, indentation, well-commented code, , well-commented code, -commented code, commented code,   properly spaced  Meets the specification of the language  in our case, JavaScript   There may come a point in time where you will notice that good coding style is  highly subjective—there are various validators that may have different opinions  or standards as to what is known as "good coding style". Therefore, if you  do use different validators to validate your code, do not freak out if you see  different advice for your coding style.  This does not mean that valid code leads to code that is functional  as you will see later   does not mean that valid code leads to code that is functional  as you will see later    and that code that is functional leads to validated code as both have different standards that is functional leads to validated code as both have different standards  is functional leads to validated code as both have different standards have different standards different standards   for comparison. comparison..  However, valid code often leads to less errors, and code that is both functional and valid is that is both functional and valid is is both functional and valid isis  often quality code. This is due to the fact that writing a piece of JavaScript code, that is both , that is both  that is both  valid and correct, is much more difficult than just writing a code that is correct. , is much more difficult than just writing a code that is correct.  is much more difficult than just writing a code that is correct. difficult than just writing a code that is correct.  than just writing a code that is correct.

Now that we have some common understanding as to what validation and testing is about,  let us move on to the next section which discusses the issues surrounding quality code.

For our purpose here, we will focus on the factors that make a piece of code valid—coding factors that make a piece of code valid—coding  a piece of code valid—coding —coding coding  style and meeting specifications.

You will notice that we will focus on the importance of code validity for testing purposes   in later parts of the chapter. But now, let us start with the first building block of quality the first building block of quality  first building block of quality of quality quality  code—valid HTML and CSS. —valid HTML and CSS. valid HTML and CSS.

Heres an important fact that is directly related to HTML, CSS, and browsers— HTML, CSS, and browsers—  CSS, and browsers— , and browsers—  and browsers—— browsers are generally forgiving towards invalid HTML and CSS code as  compared to compilers for languages like C or Python. This is because, all , all  all  browsers have to do is parse the HTML and CSS so as to render the web page  for its browsers. On the other hand, compilers are generally unforgiving towards  invalid code. Any missing tag, declarations, and so on will lead to a compilation , and so on will lead to a compilation  and so on will lead to a compilation and so on will lead to a compilation  will lead to a compilation  error. Therefore, it is ok to write invalid or even buggy HTML and CSS, yet get a  "usual" looking web page. looking web page.  Based on the previous explanation, we should see that we would need to have valid HTML the previous explanation, we should see that we would need to have valid HTML  previous explanation, we should see that we would need to have valid HTML previous explanation, we should see that we would need to have valid HTML , we should see that we would need to have valid HTML  and CSS in order to create quality JavaScript code.

This will result in unintended consequences.

How validation can simplify testing While invalid code may not cause your code to be dysfunctional, valid code often simplifies  testing. This is due to the focus on coding style and specifications; codes that are valid and that are valid and  This is due to the focus on coding style and specifications; codes that are valid and  is due to the focus on coding style and specifications; codes that are valid and the focus on coding style and specifications; codes that are valid and  focus on coding style and specifications; codes that are valid and codes that are valid and  that are valid and have met specifications are typically more likely to be correct and much easier to debug.  Consider the following code that is stylistically invalid:  function checkForm formObj { alert formObj.id    alert formObj.text.value ; var totalFormNumber = document.forms.length;    check if form elements are empty and are digits var maxCounter = formObj.length;    this is for checking for empty  values alert totalFormNumber ;    check if the form is properly filled in order to proceed if checkInput formObj == false { alert "Fields cannot be empty and it must be digits!" ;    stop executing the code since the input is invalid return false; } else{ ; } var i = 0; var formID;  [ 5 ]   Syntax Validation  while i < totalFormNumber { if formObj == document.forms[i] {  formID = i;alert i ; } i++; } if formID<4 { formID++; var formToBeChanged = document.forms[formID].id;    alert formToBeChanged ; showForm formToBeChanged ; } else{    this else statement deals with the last form    and we need to manipulate other HTML elements document.getElementById "formResponse" .style.visibility = "visible"; }   return false; }  Find the preceding code familiar?

Common errors in JavaScript that will be picked up by JavaScript that will be picked up by  that will be picked up by  validation  Ill briefly mention some of the most common validation errors that are picked up by  validators.

As mentioned in  the previous sections, differences in coding style do not necessarily lead to  functional errors but rather stylistic errors. But the good thing about good  coding style is that it often leads to less errors.  At this point, it might be difficult for you to visualize what these common errors actually look  like. But don't worry, you will get to see such validation errors in action when we introduce  the JavaScript validation tools.

You have just used JSLint to spot for validation errors. This is a simple process for JSLint: copy  and paste your code into the text area and click on JSLint. Do not be surprised that there  are so many validation errors; we are just starting out and we will learn how to fix and avoid  such validation errors.  You may have noticed that the JavaScript that is embedded in the HTML form  results in an error that says missing use strict statement. This error stems from  the fact that JSLint believes in the use of the use strict statement, which allows  the code to run under strict conditions. You will learn how to fix and avoid such  problems in later parts of this chapter.  You will continue to see many errors. In my opinion, this is evidence that valid code is not  easy to achieve; but this is what we will achieve in the next section.  As you have seen, there are various validation options, and at this stage, it is good enough  if we pass the set requirements for  we pass the set requirements for The Good Parts. Therefore, well focus on how to fix  these validation errors in the next section. But before that, I'll quickly discuss the valid code the next section. But before that, I'll quickly discuss the valid code  next section. But before that, I'll quickly discuss the valid code  But before that, I'll quickly discuss the valid code  constructs that produce validation warnings.  Valid code constructs that produce validation warnings  You may have noticed that although our code construct is valid, it has produced validation  warnings. You may be wondering if you should fix these or not. Here's some basic discussion  to help you to decide.  Should you fix valid code constructs that produce validation  warnings?? This depends on your objective. As I mentioned in Chapter 1, What is Javascript Testing?,  a code should at least be correct and work the way that we intend it to. Therefore, if your  objective is to just create functionally-correct code, then you might not want to spend the  time and effort to correct those validation warnings.  [ 2 ]   Chapter 3  However, because you are reading this book, it is very likely that you want to learn how to  test JavaScript, and validation is an important part of testing JavaScript as you will see later in   this chapter.  What happens if you don't fix them The main issue with invalidated code is that it will be much more difficult to maintain the  code, in terms of readability and scalability. This problem becomes enhanced when you are  working in teams and others have to read or maintain your code.  Valid code promotes good coding practices, which will help you to avoid problems down   the road..  How to fix validation errors  This section will continue with the errors mentioned in the previous section, and together his section will continue with the errors mentioned in the previous section, and together the errors mentioned in the previous section, and together  errors mentioned in the previous section, and together  mentioned in the previous section, and together  in the previous section, and together the previous section, and together  previous section, and together previous section, and together  section, and together  we'll attempt to fix them. Wherever possible, I'll provide some form of explanation as to  as to  I'll provide some form of explanation as to ll provide some form of explanation as to explanation as to why a particular piece of code is rendered as invalid. At the same time, the whole process particular piece of code is rendered as invalid. At the same time, the whole process  piece of code is rendered as invalid. At the same time, the whole process At the same time, the whole process  of writing valid and functionally-code can be cumbersome. Therefore, I'll start off with  validation errors that are much easier to fix, before I move on to tougher ones.  As we go along fixing the validation errors that we saw in the previous  section, you may realize that fixing validation errors may require some form of  compromise as to how you write your code. For example, you will understand  that using alert   sparingly in your code is not considered a good coding style,  at least according to JSLint. In this case, you will have to consolidate all of your  alert   statements and group them into a function, while still maintaining the  functionality of your code. More importantly, you will also realize that  perhaps   the best way to write valid code is to start writing valid code right from the first  line of the code; you will see that correcting invalid code is an extremely tedious  process, and there are times when you can only minimize your validation errors.  Along the way, you will get the chance to practice important JavaScript functions and, at the  same time, learn how to code in a better style. Thus, this is probably the most important  section of this chapter and I urge you to get your hands dirty with me. Before I get started  on fixing the code, I'll first summarize the types of errors that are spotted by JSLint.        Missing "use strict" statement Unexpected use of ++ Missing space after  , value, ==, if, else, +  [ 3 ]   Syntax Validation              Function names  such as debuggingMessages  are not defined or a function was  used before it was defined Too many var statements === used instead of == alert is not defined <\  used instead of <  HTML event handlers used  Without further ado, well get started with the first validation error: well get started with the first validation error: the first validation error:   first validation error: use strict.  Error—missing "use strict" statement The "use strict" statement is a relatively new feature in JavaScript that allows our statement is a relatively new feature in JavaScript that allows our  JavaScript to run in a strict environment. In general, it catches little-known errors, and  "forces" you to write stricter and valid code. John Resig, an expert in JavaScript, has   written a nice summary about this topic, and you can read about it by following this link:  http:  ejohn.org blog ecmascript-5-strict-mode-json-and-more .  Time for action – fixing "use strict" errors This error is extremely easy to fix. But be careful; enabling use strict may prevent your  code from working, if your code is not valid. Here's how we can fix this validation error:  1.  Open up your text editor, copy and paste the same code that we have been using, Open up your text editor, copy and paste the same code that we have been using,  and append the following code snippet on the first line of your JavaScript code: "use strict";    2.  Save your code and test it out on JSLint. You will see that the error is now gone. Save your code and test it out on JSLint. You will see that the error is now gone.  You may notice that there is another missing use strict error that is related to your HTML  form; do not worry, we will fix that in a later sub-section of this chapter. Now let us move on  to the next error.  Error—unexpected use of ++ There is nothing programmatically wrong with this line of code. What we intend  to achieve by using ++ is to increment globalCounter whenever the function  addResponseElement   is called.  [ 4 ]   Chapter 3  However, JSLInt believes that there is a problem with using ++. Take the following code  snippets as an example:  var testing = globalCounter++ + ++someValues; var testing2 = ++globalCounter + someValues++;  The previous statements would look confusing to most programmers and hence it is  considered bad style. More importantly, both of these statements are programmatically  different and produce different results. For these reasons, we need to avoid statements like  ++, --, and so on.  Time for action – fixing the error of "Unexpected use of ++" This error is relatively easy to fix. All we need to do is avoid ++. So navigate to the  So navigate to the  addResponseElement   function, and look for globalCounter++. Then change  globalCounter++ to globalCounter = globalCounter + 1. So, now your function  has changed from this:  function addResponseElement messageValue, idName {     global�ounter++;     var totalInputElements = document.testForm.length;     debuggingMessages  addResponseElement","empty", "object is a  addResponseElement","empty", "object is a value" ;     var container = document.getElementById 'formSubmit' ;     container.innerHTML += "<input type=\"text\" value=\""  +messageValue+ "\"name=\""+idName+"\"  > ";     if globalCounter == totalInputElements {         container.innerHTML += "<input type=\"submit\" value=\ "Submit\"  >";     } }  ","empty", "object is a   To this:  ", "empty", "object is a   function addResponseElement messageValue, idName  {     global�ounter = global�ounter + 1;     debuggingMessages  "addResponseElement", "empty", "object is a addResponseElement", "empty", "object is a value" ;     document.getElementById 'formSubmit' .innerHTML += "<input  type=\"text\" value=\"" + messageValue + "\"name = \"" + idName + "\"   > ";     if  globalCounter === 7  {         document.getElementById 'formSubmit' .innerHTML += "<input  type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\"  >";     } }  [ 5 ]   Syntax Validation  Compare the highlighted lines, and you will see the change in the code. Now let us move on  to the next error.  Error—functions not defined This error is caused by the way that JavaScript engines and web pages are being rendered by  web browsers. In Chapter 1, What is Javascript Testing, we mentioned briefly that web page   and JavaScript  are being parsed from top to bottom on the client side. This means that  anything that appears at the top will be read first, followed by that at the bottom.  Time for action – fixing the error of "Functions not defined" 1.  Because this error is caused by the incorrect flow of the JavaScript functions,   we will need to change the sequence of the functions. What we have done in  Chapter 2, Ad Hoc Testing and Degugging in Javascript, is that we wrote the  functions that we will be using first. This may be incorrect, as the functions may  require data or functions that are only defined in later parts of the JavaScript code.  Here's a very simplified example:   function addTWoNumbers   {     return numberOne   + numberTwo  ; } function numberOne x, y  {     return x + y; } function numberTwo a, b {     return a + b; }    Based on the previous code snippet, you will realize that  addTwoNumbers   requires data returned from numberOne   and  numberTwo  . The issue here is that the JavaScript interpreter will read  addTwoNumbers   first before reading numberOne   and numberTwo  .  However, both numberOne   and numberTwo   are being called by  addTwoNumbers  , resulting in an incorrect flow of code.  [ 6 ]   Chapter 3  This means that in order for our code to work correctly, we will need to  rearrange the order of the functions. Continuing with the previous example,  this is what we should do:   function numberOne x, y  {     return x + y; } function numberTwo a, b {     return a + b; }function addTWoNumbers   {     return numberOne   + numberTwo  ; }    In the previous code snippet, we have rearranged the sequence of the  functions.  2.  Now, we are going to rearrange the function's sequence. For our purposes, all that Now, we are going to rearrange the function's sequence. For our purposes, all that  we need to do is to arrange our functions such that the first function that originally  appeared in our code will now be the last, and the last function will be the first.  Similarly, the second function that originally appeared in the JavaScript code will  now be the second-to-last function. In other words, we will reverse the order of   the code.  3.  Once you have reversed the order of the functions, save the file and test the code Once you have reversed the order of the functions, save the file and test the code  on JSLint. You should notice that the validation errors relating to functions not being  defined are now gone.  Now, let us move on to the next validation error.  Too many var statements According to JSLint, we have used too many var statements. What does this mean? This  means that we have used more than one var statement in each function; in our case we  have obviously used more than one var statement in each and every function.  How did this happen? If you scroll down and check the settings of JSLint, you will see a  checkbox selected that says Allow one var statement per function. This means that the  maximum number of var we can use is one.  Why is this considered to be good style? Although many coders may think that this is  cumbersome, the author of JSLint would most probably believe that a good function   should do only one thing. This would typically mean operating on only one variable.  There's certainly room for discussion, but as we are all here to learn, let us get our hands  dirty by fixing this validation error.  [ 7 ]   Syntax Validation  Time for action – fixing the error of using too many var ixing the error of using too many var error of using too many var rror of using too many var of using too many var  statements In order to fix this error, we will need to do some form of code refactoring. Although code  refactoring typically means consolidating your code for it to become more concise  that is,  shorter code , you may realize that refactoring your code to fit validation standards is a lot   of work.  1.  What we will do in this section is that we will change  almost  all single var   statements that save a value into a function. The code that is mainly responsible for this particular validation error is  found checkForm function. The statements that we will need to refactor  are as follows:          var totalInputElements = document.testFormResponse.length;     var nameOfPerson = document.testFormResponse.nameOfPerson.value;     var birth = document.testFormResponse.birth.value;     var age = document.testFormResponse.age.value;     var spending = document.testFormResponse.spending.value;     var salary = document.testFormResponse.salary.value;     var retire = document.testFormResponse.retire.value;     var retirementMoney = document.testFormResponse.retirementMoney. value;     var confirmedSavingsByRetirement;     var ageDifference = retire - age;       var salaryPerYear = salary * 12;       var spendingPerYear = spending * 12;       var incomeDifference = salaryPerYear - spendingPerYear;  2.  Now we'll start to refactor our code. For each of the variables defined, we need to Now we'll start to refactor our code. For each of the variables defined, we need to  define a function with the following format: function nameOfVariable  {     return x + y;    x + y represents some form of calculation  }  I'll start off with an example. For instance, for totalInputElements thisthis  is what I will do: function totalInputElements   {     return document.testFormResponse.length; }  [  ]   3.  Based on the previous code, do something similar to what you are going to see here: Based on the previous code, do something similar to what you are going to see here:  * here are the function for all the values *  function totalInputElements   {     return document.testFormResponse.length; }  Chapter 3  function nameOfPerson   {     return document.testFormResponse.nameOfPerson.value; }  function birth   {     return document.testFormResponse.birth.value; }  function age   {     return document.testFormResponse.age.value; }  function spending   {     return document.testFormResponse.spending.value; }  function salary   {     return document.testFormResponse.salary.value; }  function retire   {     return document.testFormResponse.retire.value; }  function retirementMoney   {     return document.testFormResponse.retirementMoney.value; }  function salaryPerYear   {     return salary   * 12; }  function spendingPerYear   {     return spending   * 12; }  function ageDifference   {  [  ]   Syntax Validation      return retire   - age  ; }  function incomeDifference   {     return salaryPerYear   - spendingPerYear  ; }  function confirmedSavingsByRetirement   {     return incomeDifference   * ageDifference  ; }  function shortChange   {     return retirementMoney   - confirmedSavingsByRetirement  ; }  function yearsNeeded   {     return shortChange     12; }  function excessMoney   {     return confirmedSavingsByRetirement   - retirementMoney  ; }  Now, let us move on to the next error..  Expecting <\  instead of <\ For most of us, this error is probably one of the most intriguing. We have this validation error  because the HTML parser is slightly different to the JavaScript interpreter. In general, the  extra backslash is being ignored by the JavaScript compiler, but not by the HTML parser.  Such validation errors may appear unnecessary, but Doug Crockford knows that this has  some form of impact on our web page. Therefore, let us move on to how to fix this error.  [ 100 ]   Chapter 3  Time for action – fixing the expectation of '<\ ' instead of '< ' ixing the expectation of '<\ ' instead of '< ' ing the expectation of '<\ ' instead of '< '  the expectation of '<\ ' instead of '< '  of '<\ ' instead of '< ' Although this error is one of the most intriguing, it is one of the easiest to fix. All that we  need to do is to find all of the JavaScript statements that contain <  and change them to nd change them to  <\ . The function that is mainly responsible for this error is buildFinalResponse  .  1.  Scroll down to the function buildFinalResponse  , and change all statements   that have <  toto <\ . After you are done, you should have the following code: function buildFinalResponse name, retiring, yearsNeeded, retire,  shortChange  {     debuggingMessages  buildFinalResponse", -1, "no messages" ;  buildFinalResponse", -1, "no messages" ; ", -1, "no messages" ;      var element = document.getElementById "finalResponse" ;      if  retiring === false  {         element.innerHTML += " Hi  " + name + " , ";          element.innerHTML += " We've processed your information  and we have noticed a problem.

";          element.innerHTML += " You need to make another  " +  shortChange + "  dollars before you retire inorder to acheive  our goal ";          element.innerHTML += " You either have to increase your  income or decrease your spending.

";         element.innerHTML += " Also, you'll have'  " +  shortChange + "  amount of excess cash when you retire. ";         element.innerHTML += " Congrats! ";     } }  [ 101 ]   Syntax Validation  Notice that all <  have been changed to and see if any such errors are remaining.   been  changed to <\ . You may also want to search through the code   Now, with this error fixed, we can move on to the next validation error.  Expected '===' but found '==' In JavaScript and in most programing languages, == and === are significantly different. In  general, === is stricter than ==.  The key difference between === and == in JavaScript is that === is a strict  equal operator and it will return a Boolean true if, and only if, both the operands  are equal and of the same type. On the other hand, the of the same type. On the other hand, the == operator returns a  and of the same type. On the other hand, the Boolean true if both the operands are equal, even if they are of different types.  According to JSList, === should be used when comparing a variable to a truth value, because  it is stricter than ==. In terms of code strictness, JSLint is certainly correct in ensuring code  quality. Therefore, let us now correct this error.  Time for action – changing == to === hanging == to === Due to the reasons mentioned earlier, we will now change all == to ===, for statements that or statements that  require comparison. Although this error is relatively easy to fix, we need to understand the  importance of this error. === is much stricter than ==, and therefore it is more secure and  valid to use === instead of  instead of ==.  Going back to your source code, search for all comparison statements that contain == andand  change them to ===. == is found largely at if, andand else-if statements, because it is used  for comparisons.  Once you are done, you may want to test out your updated code at JSLint and see if you have  cleared all such errors.  Now, let us move on to yet another cumbersome error: "Alert is not defined".  Alert is not defined In general, using alert by itself leads to 'pollution' of the global namespace. Although it is by itself leads to 'pollution' of the global namespace. Although it is  convenient, this is bad code practice according to JSLInt. Therefore, the strategy that we are  going to use to fix this validation error is to use some form of code refactoring  again .  In our code, you should notice that we are largely using alert   to provide feedback in  terms of the function names, error messages, and so on. We will need to use our alert    such that it can take in various forms of messages.  [ 102 ]   Time for action – fixing "Alert is not defined" What we will do is that we will consolidate all alert   statements into one function. We  can pass a parameter to that function so that we can change the messages in the alert box  depending on the situation.  1.  Go back to your code, and define the following function at the top of your   Chapter 3    tag: function alertMessage messageObject  {     alert messageObject ;      return true; }  messageObject is the parameter that we will use to hold our message..  2.  Now, change all  Now, change all alert   statements to alertMessage   such that the message  for alert   is the same as alertMessage  . Once you are done, save the file and  run the code in JSLint again.  If you tried running your code in JSLint, you should see that the "damage" done by has been minimized to only one time, instead of over ten to twenty times.  , you should see that the "damage" done by alert     In this situation, what we can do is minimize the impact of the alert   because, for our  purposes, we do not have a ready alternative to show messages in an alert box.  Now it is time for the next error—avoiding HTML event handlers.  Avoiding HTML event handlers Good coding practices often state the need to separate programing logic and design.   In our case, we have embedded event handlers  JavaScript events  within the HTML   code. According to JSLint, such coding could be improved by avoiding HTML event   handlers altogether.  Although the ideal case is to separate programing logic from design, there is  nothing functionally wrong in using HTML intrinsic event handlers. You may  want to consider whether it is worth it  in terms of time, maintainability, and  scalability  to adhere to  almost  perfect coding practices. In the later part of this  sub-section, you may find that it can be cumbersome  or even irritating  to try to  validate  and functionally correct  code.  [ 103 ]   Syntax Validation  In order to solve this validation error, we will need to use event listeners. However, due  to the problems posed by the compatibility of event listeners, we will be using JavaScript  libraries to help us to deal with inconsistencies among the support for event listeners. We  will be using JQuery in this example.  JQuery is a JavaScript library created by John Resig. You can download JQuery by visiting  this link: http:  jquery.com. As described on this website, "JQuery is a fast and concise As described on this website, "JQuery is a fast and concise  JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, and animating,  and Ajax interactions for rapid web development." In my personal experience, JQuery  certainly makes life easier by fixing many sticky issues such as DOM incompatibilities,  providing built-in methods to create animation, and many other things. I certainly urge  you to follow a starter tutorial by going to: http:  docs.jquery.com Tutorials: Getting_Started_with_jQuery  Time for action – avoiding HTML event handlers In this section, you will learn how to avoid HTML event handlers by coding in a different  style. In this case, we will not only remove the JavaScript events embedded in each of the  HTML input elements, we will also need to write new functions for our JavaScript application  in order for it to work in the same manner. In addition to that, we will be using a JavaScript  library that will help us to remove all of the difficult stuff relating to event handling and using  event listeners.  1.  Open up the same document and scroll to the  Open up the same document and scroll to the   tags. Remove all of the HTML  event handlers that are found in the form. This is what your form's source code  should look like after you have removed all of the HTML event handlers:        <input type="text" name="enterText" id="nameOfPerson"  size="50"  value="Enter your name" >       <input type="text" name="enterText" id="birth" size="50"   value="Enter your place of birth" >       <input type="text" name="enterNumber" id="age" size="50"  maxlength="2" value="Enter your age" >       <input type="text" name="enterNumber" id="spending" size="50"  value="Enter your spending per month" >       <input type="text" name="enterNumber" id="salary" size="50"  value="Enter your salary per month" >   [ 104 ]      <input type="text" name="enterNumber" id="retire" size="50"  maxlength="3" value="Enter your the age you wish to retire at"   >                 <input type="text" name="enterNumber" id="retirementMoney"  size="50" value="Enter the amount of money you wish to have for  retirement" >   Chapter 3     2.  Now scroll to the  Now scroll to the   tag. After the   tag, enter the following   code snippet: <script src="http:  ajax.googleapis.com ajax libs jquery 1.4.2  jquery.js">    What you are doing in the preceding line is enabling JQuery in your code.  This will allow you to make use of the JQuery library when fixing your code.  Now it's time to write some JQuery code.  3.  In order to maintain the functionality of our code, we will need to use the  In order to maintain the functionality of our code, we will need to use the .blur    method provided by JQuery. Scrolling to the end of your JavaScript code, append the  following code snippet: jQuery document .ready function    {     jQuery 'nameOfPerson' .blur function    {         submitValues this ;     } ;     jQuery 'birth' .blur function    {         submitValues this ;     } ;     jQuery 'age' .blur function    {         submitValues this ;     } ;     jQuery 'spending' .blur function    {         submitValues this ;     } ;     jQuery 'salary' .blur function    {         submitValues this ;     } ;     jQuery 'retire' .blur function    {         submitValues this ;     } ;     jQuery 'retirementMoney' .blur function    {         submitValues this ;     } ;  [ 105 ]   Syntax Validation      jQuery 'formSubmit' .submit function    {          checkForm this ;          return false; } ; } ;  Here's a short explanation of how JQuery works: jQuery document . ready function   is used to start our code; it allows us to use  the methods provided in JQuery. In order to select an element, we  use jQuery 'nameOfPerson' . As mentioned earlier, we need to  maintain the functionality of the code, so we will use the .blur    method provided by JQuery. In order to do that, we append .blur   to   jQuery 'nameOfPerson' . We are required to call submitValues  ,  and we will need to enclose submitValues   within .blur  . Because  submitValues   is a function, we will enclose it as such:      jQuery 'nameOfPerson' .blur function    {         submitValues this ;     } ;  At this point of time, we should have completed the necessary corrections  in order to achieve valid and functional code. I'll briefly summarize the  corrections in the next section.  Summary of the corrections we have done Now we will refresh our memory by quickly going through what we have done to fix the  validation errors.  First, we pasted the original code into JSLint and noticed that we had a large number of  validation errors. Fortunately, the validation errors could be grouped such that similar   errors could be fixed by correcting a single code error.  Next, we started off with the correction process. In general, we tried to fix the validation  errors, starting from those which seemed to be the easiest. The first validation error that we  fixed was the missing use strict statement error. What we did was enter use strict on  the very first line of our JavaScript code, and that error was fixed.  The second validation error that we fixed was the "functions not defined error". This was  caused by an incorrect flow of the JavaScript functions. Therefore, we switched the flow of  functions from this:  function submitValues elementObj {   * some code omitted *           }  [ 106 ]   Chapter 3  function addResponseElement messageValue, idName {   * some code omitted *   function checkForm formObj {   * some code omitted *   }  }  }  }  function buildFinalResponse name,retiring,yearsNeeded,retire,  shortChange {   * some code omitted *   } function debuggingMessages functionName, objectCalled, message {   * some code omitted *   function debuggingMessages functionName, objectCalled, message  {  To this:   * some code omitted *   } function checkForm formObj  {   * some code omitted *   function addResponseElement messageValue, idName  {       * some code omitted *   function submitValues elementObj  {   * some code omitted *   Notice that we simply reversed the sequence of the functions to fix the error.  We then moved on to an error that is quite time-consuming—using too many var  statements within a function. In general, our strategy was to refactor almost all of the var  statements into standalone functions. These standalone functions' main purpose was to  return a value, and that's all.  Next, we moved into yet another time-consuming validation error, and this was "expected  <\  instead of < . In general, this error is referring to the closing HTML tags. So what we   did was to change  > to \ > for all closing HTML tags. For example, we changed the  following code:  function buildFinalResponse name,retiring,yearsNeeded,retire,  shortChange {     debuggingMessages  buildFinalResponse", -1,"no messages" ;  buildFinalResponse", -1,"no messages" ; ", -1,"no messages" ;  [ 107 ]   Syntax Validation      var element = document.getElementById "finalResponse" ;     if retiring == false {           alert "if retiring == false" ;         element.innerHTML += " Hi  " + name + " , ";         element.innerHTML += " We've processed your information and  we have noticed a problem. ";         element.innerHTML += " Base on your current spending habits,  you will not be able to retire by  " + retire + "   years old.<  p>";         element.innerHTML += " You need to make another  " +  shortChange + "  dollars before you retire inorder to acheive our  goal ";         element.innerHTML += " You either have to increase your  income or decrease your spending. ";     }     else{            able to retire but....         alert "retiring == true" ;         element.innerHTML += " Hi  " + name + " , ";         element.innerHTML += " We've processed your information and  are pleased to announce that you will be able to retire on time. ";         element.innerHTML += " Base on your current spending habits,  you will be able to retire by  " + retire + " years old.  ";         element.innerHTML += " Also, you'll have'  " + shortChange  + "  amount of excess cash when you retire. ";         element.innerHTML += " Congrats! ";     } }  To this:  function buildFinalResponse name, retiring, yearsNeeded, retire,  shortChange  {     debuggingMessages  buildFinalResponse", -1, "no messages" ;  buildFinalResponse", -1, "no messages" ; ", -1, "no messages" ;     var element = document.getElementById "finalResponse" ;     if  retiring === false  {         element.innerHTML += " Hi  " + name + " �� ";         element.innerHTML += " We've processed your information and  we have noticed a problem. ";         element.innerHTML += " Base on your current spending habits��  you will not be able to retire by  " + retire + "   years  old. ";         element.innerHTML += " You need to make another  " +  short�hange + "  dollars before you retire inorder to achieve our  goal ";  [ 10 ]   Chapter 3          element.innerHTML += " You either have to increase your  income or decrease your spending. ";     }     else {            able to retire but....           alertMessage "retiring === true" ;               element.innerHTML += " Hi  " + name + " �� ";         element.innerHTML += " We've processed your information and  are pleased to announce that you will be able to retire on time.<\  p>";         element.innerHTML += " Base on your current spending habits��  you will be able to retire by  " + retire + " years old. ";         element.innerHTML += " Also�� you'll have'  " + short�hange  + "  amount of excess cash when you retire. ";         element.innerHTML += " �ongrats� ";     } }  Note that the highlighted lines are where we have changed from  > to \ >.  After fixing the previous error, we moved on to an error that is conceptually more difficult to  understand, but easy to solve. That is, "expected === instead of saw ==". According to JSLint,  using === is stricter and more secure as compared to using ==. Therefore, we needed to  change all == to ===.  The next error, "Alert is not defined", is conceptually similar to the "Too many var  statement" error. What we need to do is to refactor allall alert   statements to call the  alertMessage   function that accepts a parameter messageObject. This allows us to use  only one alert   for almost the whole JavaScript program. Whenever we need to use an  alert box, all we need to do is to pass an argument into the alertMessage   function.  Finally, we moved on to fix one of the toughest validation errors: "Avoiding HTML event  handlers". Due to the complexities involved with event listeners, we engaged the help of  JQuery, a popular JavaScript library, and wrote some JQuery code. Firstly, we removed all of  the HTML event handlers from our HTML form. Our HTML form changed from this:       <input type="text" name="enterText" id="nameOfPerson" onblur="submi tValues this " size="50"  value="Enter your name" >     <input type="text" name="enterNumber" id="age" onblur="submitValues  this " size="50" maxlength="2" value="Enter your age" >     <input type="text" name="enterText" id="birth" onblur="submitValues  this " size="50"  value="Enter your place of birth" >     <input type="text" name="enterNumber" id="spending" onblur="submitV alues this " size="50" value="Enter your spending per month" >   [ 10 ]   Syntax Validation     <input type="text" name="enterNumber" id="salary" onblur="submitVal ues this " size="50" value="Enter your salary per month" >     <input type="text" name="enterNumber" id="retire" onblur="submitVal ues this " size="50" maxlength="3" value="Enter your the age you wish  to retire at"  >            <input type="text" name="enterNumber" id="retirementMoney" onblur ="submitValues this " size="50" value="Enter the amount of money you  wish to have for retirement" >     To this:       <input type="text" name="enterText" id="nameOfPerson" size="50"   value="Enter your name" >     <input type="text" name="enterText" id="birth" size="50"   value="Enter your place of birth" >     <input type="text" name="enterNumber" id="age" size="50"  maxlength="2" value="Enter your age" >     <input type="text" name="enterNumber" id="spending" size="50"  value="Enter your spending per month" >     <input type="text" name="enterNumber" id="salary" size="50"  value="Enter your salary per month" >     <input type="text" name="enterNumber" id="retire" size="50"  maxlength="3" value="Enter your the age you wish to retire at"  >                 <input type="text" name="enterNumber" id="retirementMoney" size="50"  value="Enter the amount of money you wish to have for retirement"  >      In order to support the new HTML form, we linked in the JQuery library, and added some  code to listen for the HTML form events, like this:    src="http:  ajax.googleapis.com ajax  libs jquery 1.4.2 jquery.js">     * some code omitted *   jQuery document .ready function    {  [ 110 ]   Chapter 3      jQuery 'nameOfPerson' .blur function    {         submitValues this ;     } ;     jQuery 'birth' .blur function    {         submitValues this ;     } ;     jQuery 'age' .blur function    {         submitValues this ;     } ;     jQuery 'spending' .blur function    {         submitValues this ;     } ;     jQuery 'salary' .blur function    {         submitValues this ;     } ;     jQuery 'retire' .blur function    {         submitValues this ;     } ;     jQuery 'retirementMoney' .blur function    {         submitValues this ;     } ;          jQuery 'formSubmit' .submit function    {         checkForm this ;         return false;     } ; } ;    The completed code can be found in the source code folder for Chapter 3, with a file  name of perfect-code-for-JSLint.html. You can compare this with your edited code  to see if you have understood what we were trying to do. Now, you may want to copy and  paste the code into JSLint and see how it goes. You will only see errors pertaining to the use  of Jquery, one validation error that complains about the use of alert  , and another error  about using too many var statements.  What just happened? We have corrected the bulk of the validation errors, from an insanely large number of  validation errors to less than ten validation errors, out of which only two or three of the  validation errors are related to our code.  [ 111 ]   Syntax Validation  You may have noticed the jQuery not defined error. Although JSLint has  captured the JQuery library that was externally linked, it does not explicitly read  the code, thus resulting in the jQuery not defined error.  Now that we have fixed the validation errors, let us now move on to another free validation  tool, the JavaScript Lint.  JavaScript Lint–a tool you can download  JavaScript Lint can be downloaded at http:  www.javascriptlint.com, and it works in  and it works in nd it works in  a manner similar to JSLint. The key difference is that JavaScript Lint is a downloadable tool,  whereas JSLint works as a web-based tool.

However, we challenge you to fix the remaining errors   apart from those caused by JQuery   [ 112 ]   Chapter 3  Challenge yourself–fix the remaining errors spotted by JSLint Ok, this is the first challenge that I will I present to you. Fix the remaining errors spotted by  JSLint, which are as follows:  alert is not defined": This is found in the alertMessage   function too many var statements": This error is found in the submitValues   function  Here are some ideas for you to get started:  In our JavaScript application, is there any way that we can avoid the alert  ? How  can we display messages that can capture the attention of our audience but at the  same time be valid? For the error found at the submitValues   function, how can we refactor the  code such that there is only one var statement in the function? Can we refactor statement in the function? Can we refactor   the var statement into a function and have it return a Boolean value?  OK, now you might want to give it a go, but be careful, because the solutions that you  propose or intend to use may cause other validation errors. So you might want to think  about your solutions before implementing them.  Summary  We've finally reached the end of this chapter. I'll first start off by summarizing some of the  strategies and tips we have used to write valid code, and follow this with a summary of the  rest of the chapter.  Some of the strategies that we have used to write valid code  according to JSLint  are   as follows:  Properly space your code, especially after mathematical signs, if, else,    ,   and so on Use only one var statement per function Consider the flow of your program; code in such a way that the required data or  functions come at the top of the program Use the alert   function sparingly. Instead, consolidate your alert   functions  into one function Use === instead of ==; this makes sure that your comparison statements are   more accurate Avoid HTML event handlers by using listeners. Alternatively, you may engage the  help of JavaScript libraries such as JQuery in order to provide event listeners   to your code.

As shown  in the example in this chapter, writing valid code  or correcting invalid code  is an extremely  tedious process. More importantly, there are some validation warnings or errors that do not  affect our program in its entirety. In such a situation, do you think that it is worth the effort  to validate our code? Or do you think we should be a perfectionist and write perfect code?  This will very much depend on our testing plan, which will dictate the scope of testing, the  things to test, and many other things. These topics will be covered in next chapter, Chapter 4,  Planning to Test. So I'll end off this chapter, and see you in the next chapter.  [ 114 ]   4  Planning to Test  Welcome to the fourth chapter. Before we move into a more formal testing  process, we must first understand what testing is about. In this chapter, we   will learn how to make a plan for testing your JavaScript program. We will   learn about the various testing concepts that you should know, after which   I will present to you a brief guideline which will be used as a basis for the   next chapter..  Before we move into the various testing concepts, we will first need to establish a brief  understanding of the following issues:  Do we really need a test plan in order to carry out testing? When should we develop the test plan for our code? How much testing do we need for our program?  After covering the above issues, we will learn about the following testing concepts and ideas:  Black box testing, white box testing, and related concepts Boundary conditions Unit testing Web page functional testing  functional testing  testing Integration testing Non-functional testing, such as performance testing functional testing, such as performance testing unctional testing, such as performance testing  testing, such as performance testing  such as performance testing Usability testing Testing order—which of the above tests do we perform first? Regression testing—which is typically done when we make changes to the code                           Planning to Test  In order to get a better overview of when and where testing plays its part, we will first start  with a very brief introduction to the software lifecycle.  A very brief introduction to the software lifecycle  Understanding the software lifecycle will help you to develop a deeper insight into the  software development process and, more importantly, when and where testing will play   its part.  In general, the software lifecycle has the following stages:  Implementation  1.  Analysis 2.  Design 3.  4.  Testing 5.  Deployment 6.  Maintenance  In the first stage, we generally perform an analysis to understand what the needs of the  stakeholders are. For instance, if you are carrying out a customized project for a customer,  you will need to understand the user requirements, system requirements, and the business  goals. Once you have understood the needs, you will need to design the software. Things to  do in this stage include drawing data flow diagrams, designing the database, and so on. The  next stage is the implementation stage. We can see this as the actual coding process.  Next comes testing, which is the main focus of this book. In this chapter, we will learn how  to plan our test based on various testing concepts. After the testing stage, we will deploy the  project, and finally we maintain the project. Because this is a cycle, we theoretically move  back to the analysis stage during or after the maintenance stage. This is because a software  or program is evolutionary; as needs and requirements change, so does our software.  Although the terminologies and number of stages may be slightly different from what you  see in other related content, the process is generally the same. The main takeaway here is  that testing typically comes after implementation.  The agile method You may have heard about the agile methodology, which includes the agile software the agile software  agile software  development methodologies, and of course, agile testing methods. methodologies, and of course, agile testing methods.  and of course, agile testing methods.

[ 116 ]   Chapter 4  So how does this relate to the software development cycle that you have read about in development cycle that you have read about in  cycle that you have read about in  the previous section? In general, testing is not an individual phase by itself, but rather is  closely integrated with the development process, with code being tested from the customer  perspective, as early as possible, when code becomes stable enough to perform testing.  when code becomes stable enough to perform testing.  code becomes stable enough to perform testing. enough to perform testing.  to perform testing.

Despite the best of of intentions, code is not always error-free. error-free. is not always error-free.  Do you need a test plan to be able to test?  You will most likely require a test plan in order to carry out testing. This is because a plan  helps you keep a clear objective on what to test. It also helps you to figure out what kind of  tests you want to perform on your program.  [ 117 ]   Planning to Test  Most importantly, as you will realize, in order to carry out a thorough test you will need to  implement various tests, including testing concepts based on white box testing and black box  testing, web page testing, unit testing, integration testing, and so on. A test plan also serves  as a record of your test data, bugs, test results, and possible solutions for your bugs. This  means that in order to ensure that you do not miss anything, it is good to have a solid plan   as to what to test, when to test, and how to test your program.  When to develop the test plan  In theory, if you look at the software development cycle, you will see that testing comes after f you look at the software development cycle, you will see that testing comes after  implementation. Development of the test plan should take place after you have completed  implementation  the actual coding process  of the program. This is because it is only at this  point that you have confirmed what features, methods, and modules you have; planning  what to test based on what you have already done makes good business sense, because   you know what to focus on.  However, in practice, it is advisable to start planning before the implementation process. owever, in practice, it is advisable to start planning before the implementation process. , in practice, it is advisable to start planning before the implementation process.  in practice, it is advisable to start planning before the implementation process. ce, it is advisable to start planning before the implementation process. e, it is advisable to start planning before the implementation process.  Depending on your situation, it is certainly possible that you can develop a High Level Test  Plan  HLTP  or High Level Test Case  HLTC .

Another point that you should take note of is that, in practice, the test plan can be broadly  categorized into system test and user acceptance test. System test covers all forms of  functional testing and non-functional testing  which you learn about later , whereas user -functional testing  which you learn about later , whereas user  testing  which you learn about later , whereas user  acceptance testing is a phase where testing is carried out by end users prior to transferring  prior to transferring prior to transferring  to transferring  transferring  ownership to them.  How much testing is required?  You might be anxious to determine what you need to test and what you do not. Although  there are many different arguments as to how much testing is required, I personally believe  the aspects of your program listed in the following sections should define the scope of your  test plan.  [ 11 ]   Chapter 4  What is the code intended to do? Firstly, you need to understand what the code is intended to do. For instance, the business  For instance, the business  requirements for our code in the previous chapters is to calculate whether the user can  retire on time, based on his inputs, such as his current age, the age at which he wants to  age, the age at which he wants to  the age at which he wants to  retire, his current spending, current salary, and so on. Therefore, we created code that  we created code that  , and so on. Therefore, we created code that  and so on. Therefore, we created code that , we created code that meets the business needs. Once we know what our code is intended to do, we can test Once we know what our code is intended to do, we can test  whether the code satisfies our business needs. satisfies our business needs..  Testing whether the code satisfies our needs By testing the code to see if it satisfies our business needs, we mean that for each input, we satisfies our business needs, we mean that for each input, we , we mean that for each input, we  need to get the correct output. Going back to our example in Chapter 2, Ad hoc Testing and  Debugging in JavaScript and Chapter 3, Syntax Validation, I would need to ensure that if the  total left-over income is less than the amount of money that is needed for retirement, the  output would be "unable to retire", at least in a pseudo sense. What we need to do from  a testing point of view is to make sure that whenever the mentioned condition is true, the  output would be "unable to retire".  This can be achieved through a concept called white box testing, where testing is carried  based on the assumption that the tester knows what the code is about. I'll cover the specific  details of white box testing and other testing concepts in the following chapters. To give you To give you  a heads up, some of the testing concepts that you will encounter will include unit testing,,  where you test codes in small units, and boundary values testing, where you test for the where you test for the  and boundary values testing, where you test for the boundary values testing, where you test for the , where you test for the maximum or minimum acceptable values of your code. minimum acceptable values of your code.  acceptable values of your code.  The next thing that we will need to consider is how to test for or detect invalid actions   by users.  Testing for invalid actions by users "Never trust users" is a phrase which we most commonly hear when developing for the  Web. This is because there may be malicious users who attempt to "break" your applications  by giving invalid input. Using the example from previous chapters, the input fields for the  name can only accept characters and spaces, and the input fields for the age and salary can  only accept numbers, and not characters. However, if someone were to attempt to enter  characters into the age or salary field, this would be an invalid action.  Our program will have to be robust enough to test or check for invalid actions; incorrect  input will result in incorrect output.  [ 11 ]   Planning to Test  A short summary of the above issues By knowing what your code is intended for and what it is supposed to do, and understanding  the need to detect invalid actions by users, you have already defined the scope of your test  plan. Your tests should revolve around these criteria.  We can now move on to the various testing concepts that you will be using for various  aspects of your test, and the building blocks of a test plan—major testing concepts —major testing concepts major testing concepts   and strategies.  Major testing concepts and strategies  In this section, we will cover different types of testing concepts and strategies. I will not  attempt to go into too much detail with regards to each concept, but rather I need you to get  the gist of it and see where each of these concepts is coming from. After you have gained  familiarity with these concepts, we will move on to creating the actual test plan. As a start, I As a start, I  will begin with the business strategies that developers follow  whether you are performing begin with the business strategies that developers follow  whether you are performing  with the business strategies that developers follow  whether you are performing follow  whether you are performing  whether you are performing  a project for an external or an internal client , so that you can gain a high-level idea of how , so that you can gain a high-level idea of how  so that you can gain a high-level idea of how -level idea of how level idea of how  testing is conducted. In general, no matter what testing concepts, methodology, or ideology testing concepts, methodology, or ideology g concepts, methodology, or ideology methodology, or ideology  or ideology  you subscribe to, you will face the following test cases:         Functional requirement testing unctional requirement testing requirement testing  testing Non-functional requirement testing on-functional requirement testing -functional requirement testing functional requirement testing Acceptance testing  Functional requirement testing Functional requirement testing is meant to test the code, a function, or a module of a , or a module of a  or a module of a  software system. For instance, going back to the code that we wrote for the previous system. For instance, going back to the code that we wrote for the previous . For instance, going back to the code that we wrote for the previous  chapters, the functional requirements consists of the following: functional requirements consists of the following:  requirements consists of the following:  1.  Check user's input for validity. 2.   If the input from step 1 is valid, a new input box will appear on the right-hand side is valid, a new input box will appear on the right-hand side s valid, a new input box will appear on the right-hand side  of the current input box, after the users mouse moves on to the next input box. s on to the next input box.  on to the next input box..  3.  Provide the correct calculation output based on the users input. For example, if the calculation output based on the users input. For example, if the  output based on the users input. For example, if the  user requires 1,000,000 dollars for retirement, and he only has 500,000 dollars by  the time he retires, then he will not be able to retire. en he will not be able to retire. n he will not be able to retire.

We will start with one of the most commonly-heard testing concepts, the start with one of the most commonly-heard testing concepts, the  black box testing concept.  Black box testing Black box testing belongs to the "box approach", where a piece of software is regarded as  a box and the box contains various functions, methods, classes, and so on. Metaphorically,  a "black box" typically means that we cannot see what is inside the box. This means that  we implement the test without knowing the internal structure of our program; we take an  external perspective of the program, using valid and invalid inputs in order to determine ifif  the output is correct.  output is correct. is correct..  Because we have no knowledge about the internal structure and code of the program,   we can only test the program from a user's point of view. In this case, we might try to  determine what the major functions are, and then attempt to implement our test   based on these functions.  The main advantage of black box testing is that the test results are often unaffiliated,  because the tester has no knowledge of the code. However, the disadvantage is that because  the tester has no idea of what the code is about, the tester may create tests or perform tests  that may be repetitive, or tests that fail to test the most important aspects of the software.  Or worse, the tester may miss out an entire function or method.  That is why, in the real world, test cases are prepared in the early phases of the development , in the real world, test cases are prepared in the early phases of the development  in the real world, test cases are prepared in the early phases of the development the early phases of the development  early phases of the development  cycle, so that we will not miss out on certain requirements. The advantage is that testers will The advantage is that testers will  advantage is that testers will advantage is that testers will  is that testers will  have access to the required test cases, but at the same time, the testers need not have full  knowledge of the code.  Some examples of black box testing include usability testing, boundary testing, and   beta testing.  [ 122 ]   Chapter 4  Usability tests In simple terms, usability testing typically involves testing from the user's point of view, to  see if the program we have created is easy to use. The key objective here is to observe users  using our program, to discover errors or areas of improvement. Usability testing generally  includes the following aspects:          Performance: especially in terms of the number of clicks  or actions  that a user has especially in terms of the number of clicks  or actions  that a user has  that a user has  a user hass  to take in orders to complete a particular task, such as signing up as a member, or  to complete a particular task, such as signing up as a member, or  s to complete a particular task, such as signing up as a member, or purchasing a product form a website, and so on. , and so on.  and so on. can users remember how to use the program after not using it for a Recall: can users remember how to use the program after not using it for a  not using it for a  for a for a   certain period?  period?  users? Accuracy: does our program design result in mistakes by the end users? does our program design result in mistakes by the end users? result in mistakes by the end users?  in mistakes by the end users? users?? Feedback: feedback is certainly one of the most important AJAX-related application -related application related application   is certainly one of the most important AJAX-related application certainly one of the most important AJAX-related application  one of the most important AJAX-related application issues. For instance, after submitting an AJAX form, a user will typically wait for  some form of feedback,  in the form of visual feedback, such as a success message .  a success message . .  But imagine this—if there is no form of visual feedback or success message, how will —if there is no form of visual feedback or success message, how will if there is no form of visual feedback or success message, how will  the user know if he has submitted the form successfully or unsuccessfully?  Boundary testing Boundary testing is a form of testing method where the maximum and minimum values are  tested. Boundary testing sometimes includes the testing of error values and typical values.  For instance, in the program in the previous chapters, the maximum number of characters  we allow for the entry of names are 20 characters.  Equivalence partitioning Equivalence partition testing is a technique that divides a range of data into partitions from  partition testing is a technique that divides a range of data into partitions from divides a range of data into partitions from  a range of data into partitions from  which test cases can be derived. For instance, for input boxes accepting a users' age, it For instance, for input boxes accepting a users' age, it or instance, for input boxes accepting a users' age, it  should exhibit the following partition: partition::  Note that only positive values are accepted for our example to read in a users' age, to read in a users' age,   as a person's age should technically be positive. Therefore, any negative values are , any negative values are  any negative values are  unacceptable values.  values.  For the range that is less than -2231 and larger than 231-1, it is asssumed that the integers can  only hold values between -231 and 231-1 due to hardware and EMCA operator requirements.  [ 123 ]   Planning to Test Beta testing Beta testing has been popularized by the current popular Web 2.0 companies, such as  Google, where web applications are often released to a limited audience other than the core  programing team. Beta testing occurs after alpha testing, where most of the bugs and faults  have been detected and fixed. Beta testing is often used as a way to gain feedback from  prospective users.  an open source  Such a process is commonly seen in open source projects, such as Ubuntu  an open source  an open source operating system based on Linux , jQuery  a JavaScript library , and Django  a Python-based  system based on Linux , jQuery  a JavaScript library , and Django  a Python-based  , jQuery  a JavaScript library , and Django  a Python-based , jQuery  a JavaScript library , and Django  a Python-based jQuery  a JavaScript library , and Django  a Python-based Query  a JavaScript library , and Django  a Python-based  a JavaScript library , and Django  a Python-based a JavaScript library , and Django  a Python-based  , and Django  a Python-based  and Django  a Python-based  a Python-based a Python-based -based based  web framework .

Such open source projects or software typically have a series of alpha and rce projects or software typically have a series of alpha and ce projects or software typically have a series of alpha and ve a series of alpha and  a series of alpha and series of alpha and  beta releases. They also typically have release candidates prior to releasing a major version  of the software or project.  White box testing White box testing is also known as clear box testing, glass box testing, or transparent testing.  White box testing can be seen as the opposite of black box testing; we test the program with  knowledge of the internal structure of our program. We take an internal perspective of the  program, and use this perspective when we implement our test plan.  White box testing typically occurs when the test has access to the internal code and data  structures of the program. Because we take an internal perspective of our program and   with knowledge of our source code, we design the test plan based on our code.  We might find ourselves tracing the path of how our code is executed and work out what are  the input and output values for various functions or methods of our program.  Some examples of white box testing include Branch testing, and Pareto testing. ranch testing, and Pareto testing. areto testing.   Branch testing testing esting Branch testing is a concept where each branch of the code should be tested at least once.  This means that all functions or code that has been written should be tested. In software his means that all functions or code that has been written should be tested. In software   refers to how much source code  testing, there is a measure known as code coverage, which refers to how much source code , which refers to how much source code  which refers to how much source code which refers to how much source code of a program has been tested.

[ 124 ]   Pareto testing Pareto testing is what I personally call "real world" testing, and is conducted under strict  time and money constraints. This is because Pareto testing only focuses on the most used  functions; the most frequently used functions are what matter the most and hence we  should focus our time and effort on testing these functions. Alternatively, we may see  Pareto testing such that most bugs come from a small handful of functions of our programs;  therefore, by spotting these functions, we can test our program much more effectively.  Chapter 4  Pareto testing is derived from an idea called "Pareto Principle" or perhaps  better known as the "80-20 principle". What the Pareto Principle suggests is  that roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. For instance,  80% of the sales revenue may come from 20% of the sales team or customers.  Or another example would be 80% of the world wealth is control by 20% of the  world's population. Applied in our case here, we can say that 80% of the bugs  or program errors come from 20% of our code, and therefore we should focus  testing on that particular 20% of the code. Alternatively, we can say that 80%  of the program's usage activity comes from 20% of our code. Similarly, we can  the record, pareto focus testing on that particular 20% of the code. Just for the record, pareto  Just for the record, pareto Just for the record, pareto st for the record, pareto  record, pareto  testing can be regarded as a general testing principle, and not just a form of general testing principle, and not just a form of  testing principle, and not just a form of  and not just a form of  not just a form of  white box testing.  Unit tests Unit testing breaks up code into logical chunks for testing, and generally focuses on   one method at a time. A unit can be seen as the smallest possible chunk of code, such   as a function or method. This means that in the ideal situation, each unit should be  independent from all other units.  When we are performing unit testing, we attempt to test each function or method as we  complete it, thus making sure that whatever code we have works before we move on to , thus making sure that whatever code we have works before we move on to   the next function or method.  This helps to reduce errors, and you may have noticed that we have somehow applied the  idea of unit testing when developing the JavaScript program in the previous chapters. As we  create each function, we try to test it whenever possible.  Some of the benefits of unit testing includes minimization of errors, and allowing ease of  change, because each function or method is tested individually in isolation and, to a good  extent, simplifies integration.  The main benefit, in my opinion, is that unit tests are flexible and allow ease of he main benefit, in my opinion, is that unit tests are flexible and allow ease of  in my opinion, is that unit tests are flexible and allow ease of , is that unit tests are flexible and allow ease of  is that unit tests are flexible and allow ease of  unit tests are flexible and allow ease of unit tests are flexible and allow ease of  flexible and allow ease of le and allow ease of  and allow ease of allow ease of ease of  documentation. This is because as we write and test new functions, we can easily take note  of what the problems are, and whether the code can work correctly. In effect, we are doing  incremental documentation—documenting the results as we test. —documenting the results as we test. documenting the results as we test.  [ 125 ]   Planning to Test   For example, as I was creating the code for Chapter 2  Unit testing is also an integral part of integrated testing, especially in the bottom-up  approach, as we test our program from the smallest possible unit before moving on to larger  units. For example, as I was creating the code for in Javascript, I essentially carried out unit testing informally. I carried out unit testing by I essentially carried out unit testing informally.

This technique can be seen as part of performing continuous integration   as new code is being written.  hapter 22, Ad Hoc Testing and Debugging   Continuous integration is a process where developers integrate their code frequently, in ontinuous integration is a process where developers integrate their code frequently, in developers integrate their code frequently, in  integrate their code frequently, in  order to prevent integration errors.

Web page tests As mentioned previously, web page testing is a form of functional testing, and typically refers functional testing, and typically refers  testing, and typically refers typically refers  to the testing of the user interface, from the user's point of view. For our purposes here, we  would test our JavaScript program in conjunction with HTML and CSS.  Web page testing also includes testing for correctness in terms of different browsers and  platforms. We should at least focus on the major web browsers such as Internet Explorer and  Firefox, and see if the presentation and JavaScript program works under different browsers.

Integration testing Integrated testing is among the last steps of the testing process prior to acceptance testing.  among the last steps of the testing process prior to acceptance testing.  of the testing process prior to acceptance testing.  prior to acceptance testing.  to acceptance testing.  acceptance testing..  Because we have made sure that the basic building blocks of the program work correctly as  an individual unit, we will now need to make sure if they can work together.  Integration testing refers to the testing of all of the different components of our program.  The different components can refer to the various units that we have talked about so far.  The main objective of integration testing is to ensure that the functional, performance, and  reliability requirements are met. We also test the different units together and see if they can  work; we'll need to check for any irregularities when combining the units together.  Integration testing can take different forms, such as top-down and bottom-up approach.  [ 127 ]   Planning to Test  In the top-down approach, we start with the highest-level integrated module, followed   by the sub-modules or functions of each module. On the other hand, bottom-up testing   starts from the lowest level components before moving on to the upper-level components.  Based on the sample code that we have seen so far, it would be difficult to understand how  integrated testing works. In general, if we view the HTML code as a unit, CSS as a unit, and  each individual JavaScript function as a unit, we can see that integrated testing would include  testing all three together and making sure that it is correct.  In the bottom-up approach, we begin testing from the basic units of code. As we test the basic  units of code, we move up to test larger units of code. This process is similar to unit testing.  Regression testing–repeating prior testing after making changes Regression testing focuses on uncovering errors in a program when a program is   being modified or upgraded. In real-life situations, we tend to make changes to a   program— whether this is upgrading it, adding new features, and so on. The key point   is that as we make changes to a program, we need to test the new components to see   if they work in conjunction with the old components.  We need to perform regression testing because research and experience have shown  that as a program is being modified, new or old errors may appear. For instance, an old,  previously-fixed bug may be re-introduced into the program when a new feature is being  added, or the new feature itself may contain a bug that affects the existing features. This  is where regression testing comes in: we perform previous tests to make sure that the old  components are still running and that no old faults have re-emerged. We test the new  features with the old components to ensure that the entire system is working. Sometimes,  in order to save time and resources, we may only perform testing on the new features  in conjunction with the old components. At this point, we can apply impact analysis to At this point, we can apply impact analysis to  determine the impact area of the application, by adding or modifying code.  Regression testing is as real as it gets. This is because as a program grows, the chances   there is a  are that you will make changes to your code. As you make changes to your code there is a likelihood that bugs or incompatibilities may be introduced to your program, and regression  regression   that bugs or incompatibilities may be introduced to your program, and regression , and regression testing helps you to spot such mistakes.  Testing order  We have now covered the required background knowledge, so it is time to understand   what kind of tests we should start with. The order in which we carry out the tests depends  on whether we want to implement bottom-up testing or top-down testing. There is nothing  wrong with either order of testing, but I personally prefer bottom-up testing: I'll typically  start with unit testing first, followed by other types of tests  depending on what the program  is like , and finish off with integration testing.  [ 12 ]   Chapter 4  The main reason for taking this approach is that unit testing allows us to find errors in  the code much earlier; this prevents bugs or errors from piling up. In addition, it provides  flexibility in how you choose to document the test results.   However, if you prefer the top-down approach, you can always start by testing the program  as if you were an end user.  In the real world, especially in terms of testing web applications, it can be difficult to  differentiate  at least conceptually  between bottom-up testing and top-down testing. This is  because although the user-interface and programing logic are separated, we really need to d, we really need to , we really need to  test both at the same time in order to understand if it works the way that we want it to.  Nonetheless, the testing order should finish with user acceptance testing, because the end  users are the ones who will be using our code eventually.  In the next section, we will show you how to document your test plan. You will notice that  we will be performing tests from the users' point of view. Now, it is time to document our ill be performing tests from the users' point of view. Now, it is time to document our performing tests from the users' point of view.

Now, it is time to document our Now, it is time to document our  test plan.  Documenting your test plan  Now that we have covered the required testing concepts, it is time to learn how we can  create the test plan. At the same time, we will document our test plan; this will serve as a  basis for the next part of this chapter, where we will apply the test.  The test plan Our test plan will consist of some of the concepts we have covered earlier, such as web page  testing, boundary testing, integration testing, and others. Because we are applying the test ion testing, and others. Because we are applying the test  testing, and others. Because we are applying the test  on the code we have used in Chapter 2, Ad Hoc Testing and Debugging in Javascript, we have  the advantage of knowing what the code is about. Therefore, we can design our test process  in such a way that it can incorporate ideas from both black box testing and white box testing.  You might want to go to the source code folder and open the sample_test_plan.doc  file, which is our sample test plan. This is a very simple and informal test plan, which contains  which is our sample test plan. This is a very simple and informal test plan, which contains  only the bare minimum of the required components. If you are writing documentation for  your own reference, you can save on time and effort by using a simple document. However,  if you are preparing a test plan for a client, you will need a more elaborate document. For  simplicity sake, we'll use the sample document provided in the source code folder to help  you understand the planning process quickly. I will briefly run through the components of  our test plan and at the same time, I will introduce to you the main components of our   test plan.  [ 12 ]   Planning to Test Versioning In the first component, you will notice that there is a version table, which documents the  changes in the test plan. In the real world, plans change and therefore, it is a good habit to  keep track of the things that have changed.  Another way to keep versioning easy and maintainable is to use version  control software such as Git or BitBucket. Such versioning tools keep a log of  the changes that you have made in your code; this will enable to trace what  changes you have made, and this makes creating tests plans a lot easier.   You can visit http:  git-scm.com  to learn more about Git, and it, andand  http:  bitbucket.org  to learn more about BitBucket.  Test strategy The next important component that you should notice is the test strategy. The test strategy  represents the main thoughts and ideas that we will be using for our test plan. You will see  that we are employing both white box and black box testing, along with unit testing and  integration testing. Because our JavaScript program is web-based, we are implicitly carrying  out a form of web page testing, although this is not mentioned in the subsequent parts of  the chapter. For each phase of the test, we will decide on the test values required. Also, if  you look at the sample_test_plan.doc, you will see that I have added, in the form of a  brief description of the expected values, the result or response for each part of the test.  Testing expected and acceptable values by using white box testing The first thing that we will be doing is white box testing by using unit testing. Because we  have a strong understanding of the code and user interface  the HTML and CSS code , we g understanding of the code and user interface  the HTML and CSS code , we  understanding of the code and user interface  the HTML and CSS code , we  will apply the test at the user-interface level. This means that we will test the program by  entering the various test values that we have decided upon.  In this case, we will use the program as we have already used in Chapter 2, Ad Hoc Testing and  Debugging in Javascript, and Chapter3, Syntax Validation, and see if the program works the  way that we intended it to. We will be using values that are expected and acceptable here.  The input will be what the program requires us to enter—for input fields that require us to  enter down our name, place of birth, and so on, we will enter characters into it. Input fields  that require numbers as inputs, such as age, the age at which we would like to retire, salary,  expenses, and so on, we will enter numbers.  [ 130 ]   The details of the input are as follows  the input values are for demonstration details of the input are as follows  the input values are for demonstration  as follows  the input values are for demonstration   purposes only :  Chapter 4  Input fields Name Place of birth Age Spending per month Salary per month Age at which you wish to retire Amount of money I want by I want by  want by  retirement age  Input value  case 1  Johnny Boy San Francisco an Francisco 25 1000 100000 55 1000000  Input Value  case 2  Billy Boy San Francisco an Francisco 25 1000 2000 55 1000000  For each of the input values, we would expect a corresponding input field to be created  dynamically in the middle of the screen, under the header Response, and at the same time,  the original input field would be disabled. This is known as the expected output, result,  or response for the test. This goes on for the rest of the input fields for the first form. An  example of the dynamically-created field is shown in the following screenshot:  Notice that in the middle of the screenshot, under the header the header fields. These input fields are created dynamically. These input fields are created dynamically. hese input fields are created dynamically.   header Response, there are two input  there are two input are two input  two input two input  input   [ 131 ]   Planning to Test Testing expected and unacceptable values by using black box testing The second thing that we will be doing is to perform black box testing by employing  boundary value testing. There are two parts to this test: we will first test the boundary values  of the program to see if the output is correct. The inputs are similar to what we have used  for white box testing, except that we will use unusually large numbers, or unusually large  number of characters, for each input. We will also use single number and single characters as  part of our inputs. The output for each of the inputs should be similar to what we have seen  in white box testing.  To be more specific, we will be using the following test values  note that the test values are o be more specific, we will be using the following test values  note that the test values are  purely for demonstration purposes only; when you are creating your program you have to  decide what suitable boundary values should be used :  Input fields Name  Common Value Maximum value Eugene  Comments Range of values  X :  Minimum Value A single  character, such  as 'a'  A single  character, such  as a  Place of birth  New York City  Age  Spending per  month  Salary per alary per  month  1  1  2  25  2000  5000  An extremely  long string, nott  more than 255 than 255255  characters.. An extremely  long string, nott   more than 255  characters.. No more than o more than  200 years old  1000000000  1000000000  Age at which  you wish to  retire Amount of  money I want I want  want  by retirement  age  This age should  be greater than  the present age We will be using  1 here  This age should  be greater than  the present age A suitable  number, such  as 1000000  This age should  be greater than  the present age No more than a o more than a  trillion dollars  Single character 1 <= X 1 <= X<=  X  <= 255 characters  Range of values  X :  Single character 1 <= X 1 <= X<=  X  <= 255 characters  Range of values  X :  1 <=  X <= 200 Range of values  X :  1 <=  X <= 1000000000 1000000000 Notice that that we are  assuming that our user  that our user  earns more than he  spends. Range of values  X :  1 <=  X <= 1000000000 Range of values  X :  1 <=  X <= 200  Range of values  X :  1 <=  X <= 1000000000  [ 132 ]   If you refer to the sample test document, you will realize that I have provided a sample  range of values for each of the input fields.  Chapter 4  Remember that we've touched on equivalence partitioning in the earlier  sections? In practice, given a boundary value, we would test three values  relating to the given test value. For example, if we want to test a boundary  value of '50', then we will test on 49, 50, and 51. However for simplicity's  sake, we will be testing on the intended value only. This is because in the  next chapter we will be carrying out the actual test for the given values; it  can get repetitive and tedious. I just want you to know what the real world  practices are.  The second part of this test is that we will test for expected illegal values. In the first  values. In the first . In the first  In the first  scenario, we will be using values that are both accepted and unaccepted. The input will e will be using values that are both accepted and unaccepted. The input will  be similar to what we have used for the white box testing phase, except that we will use  will useuse  characters as inputs for input fields that require numbers, and vice versa. The expected  output each time that we enter an unaccepted value is that there will be an alert box telling  us that we have entered a wrong value.  For details, check the following table:  Input fields  Input Value  Name Place of birth Age  Spending per month  Salary per month alary per month  Age at which you wish  to retire at Amount of money II  want by retirement age  Digits or empty values Digits or empty values Characters and empty haracters  and empty  values Characters and empty haracters  and empty  values Characters and empty haracters  and empty  values Characters and empty haracters  and empty  values Characters and empty haracters  and empty  values  a  a  a  a  Input Value  Case 1 ase 1 1 1 a  Input Value  Case 2 ~!@$%^&*  " ~!@$%^&*  " ~!@$%^&*  "  Input Value  Case 3 Testing esting testing -1  ~!@$%^&*  "  ~!@$%^&*  "  ~!@$%^&*  "  ~!@$%^&*  "  -1  -1  -1  -1  In general, for each of the expected illegal values, we should expect our program to alert us  with an alert box, telling us that we have entered the wrong type of values.  [ 133 ]   Planning to Test  In the second test scenario, we will attempt to enter non-alphanumeric values, such as non-alphanumeric values, such as , such as  exclamation marks, asterisk signs, and so on..  In the third test scenario, we will test for negative values for input fields that require require  numbers. The input values for the third test scenario are as follows:We are using -1 to  The input values for the third test scenario are as follows:We are using -1 to he input values for the third test scenario are as follows:We are using -1 to third test scenario are as follows:We are using -1 to  test scenario are as follows:We are using -1 to scenario are as follows:We are using -1 to  are as follows:We are using -1 to We are using -1 to   save some typing; so negative values such as -100000 don't make any difference.  Testing the program logic For this part of the test plan, we will attempt to test the program logic. Part of ensuring or this part of the test plan, we will attempt to test the program logic. Part of ensuring Part of ensuring art of ensuring  program logic is to ensure that the inputs are what we need and want. However, certain  aspects of the program logic cannot be guaranteed simply by validating the input values alone. y validating the input values alone. validating the input values alone.  For instance, an implicit assumption that we have about the user is that we assume the  user will enter a retirement age that is bigger than his present age. While this assumption retirement age that is bigger than his present age. While this assumption  age that is bigger than his present age. While this assumption  is logically sound, users may or may not enter the value according to conventional  assumptions. Therefore, we need to guarantee the logic of the program is correct by , we need to guarantee the logic of the program is correct by  we need to guarantee the logic of the program is correct by is correct byby  ensuring that the retirement age is greater than the present age.  The inputs for this test are as follows: he inputs for this test are as follows: inputs for this test are as follows:  as follows:  Input fields Name Place of birth Age Spending per month Salary per month alary per month Age at which you wish to retire Amount of money I want by I want by  want by  retirement age  Input value of first form Johnny Boy San Francisco an Francisco 30 1000 2000 25 1000000  The key thing to note here is that the value for "age at which you wish to retire " is smaller  than "age".  We should expect our program to spot this logical error; if it does not, we will need to fix   our program.  Integrated testing and testing unexpected values The final phase is integrated testing, where we test the entire program and see if it works  together, which includes the first form, the second form which is derived from the first form,  and so on.  [ 134 ]   Chapter 4  In the first test scenario, we begin slow and steady by testing expected and acceptable  values. The input values for the first test scenario are as follows  the input values are for   the input values are for  the input values are for  demonstration purposes only :  Input fields  Name Place of birth Age Spending per month Salary per month alary per month Age at which you wish  to retire Amount of money II  want by retirement age  Input Value Valuealue    case 1  Johnny Boy San Francisco an Francisco 25 1000 100000 55  Input Value   case 2  Johnny Boy San Francisco an Francisco 25 1000 2000 55  Input Value   case 3  Johnny Boy San Francisco 25 1000 2000 28  Input Value   case 4  Johnny boy San Francisco 25 1000 100000 28  2000000  2000000  1000000  100000  Take note of the input values that are underlined. These input values are designed to  determine if we will get the correct response based on the input. For example, after entering  all of the values and submitting the dynamically-generated second form, the input values for  case 1 and case 3 will result in an output stating that the user will not be able to retire on  time, whereas the input values for case 2 and 4 will result in an output stating that the user  will retire on time.

The input values for the  first test scenario are as follows:  Input fields  Input value of first form Input Value the second form   Name Place of birth Age Spending per month Salary per month alary per month Age at which you wish to  retire at Amount of money I want I want  want  by retirement age  Johnny Boy San Francisco an Francisco 25 1000 100000 20   1000000  1000000   random values  25 100 Johnny Boy  Boy Some characters More characters ore characters Even more characters ven more characters  The main objective of this phase of the test is to test the robustness of the second form,  which we have not verified up to this point of time. If the second form fails, we will need to  change our code to enhance the robustness of our program.  We'll now move on to the next component of our test plan—errors or bugs found.

Chapter 4  Summary of our test plan The components introduced above are some of the most important components of a test  plan. In general, for each phase of the test, we have stated our test data and our expected  output. Note that we are using this documentation as an informal way of reminding  ourselves of what tests needs to be done, the required inputs, expected outputs, and  more importantly the bugs that we have found. One thing not mentioned in this sample  documentation is the action to be performed for those bugs that are discovered; this will   be covered in the next chapter.  Summary  We effectively carried out the planning process for our test plan. Although our test plan is planning process for our test plan. Although our test plan is  process for our test plan. Although our test plan is  informal, we have seen how we can apply various testing concepts, coupled with different  test data values to test our program that we have created in previous chapters.  that we have created in previous chapters.  we have created in previous chapters.  Specifically, we covered the following topics:            We first started off with a brief introduction to the key aspects of software  engineering. We've learned that testing takes place after the implementation   coding  stage. We've learned to define the scope of our test by asking what our code is suppose to  do, making sure that it does what it is supposed to do, and finally testing for invalid d to do, and finally testing for invalid  to do, and finally testing for invalid , and finally testing for invalid  and finally testing for invalid  actions by users. Next we covered various testing concepts such as white box testing, black box  testing, unit testing, web page testing, performance testing, integrated testing,  page testing, performance testing, integrated testing, page testing, performance testing, integrated testing, , integrated testing,  testing,,   and regression testing. We also learnt that we need to test our program from different aspects, thus t that we need to test our program from different aspects, thus  that we need to test our program from different aspects, thus  enhancing the robustness of the program. Although the testing concepts introduced in this chapter may be different in certain certain  aspects, we can group them as: testing expected but acceptable values, expected  but unacceptable values, and unexpected values in general. We've also learnt to  and unexpected values in general. We've also learnt tot to to  , and unexpected values in general.

Next, well test the logic of our program. Lastly, we'll Lastly, we'll astly, we'll  perform integrated testing and testing of unexpected values or actions.  Apart from performing the above tests, here's what we will also cover in this chapter:              Regression testing in action—youll learn how to perform regression testing by fixing —youll learn how to perform regression testing by fixing youll learn how to perform regression testing by fixing  bugs and then testing your program again en testing your program again n testing your program again The differences between client-side testing and server-side testing he differences between client-side testing and server-side testing How using Ajax may make a difference to testing What to do when a test returns a wrong result What happens if your visitor turns off JavaScript How to enhance performance by compressing your JavaScript code ow to enhance performance by compressing your JavaScript code  So let us get our hands dirty, and start testing right away.   Putting the Test Plan Into Action  Applying the test plan: running your tests in order  In this section, we'll simply apply the test plan to our program. For simplicity's sake, we will  sake, we will  we will  record any bugs or errors in the Bug Report Form found in the sample test plan from the  previous section. In addition to that, at the end of each test, we will record a Pass or Fail text section. In addition to that, at the end of each test, we will record a Pass or Fail text . In addition to that, at the end of each test, we will record a Pass or Fail text  in the sample_text_plan.doc, which we created in the previous chapter.

However, take  note that in the real world  especially if you are working on a custom project for your client , especially if you are working on a custom project for your client ,  if you are working on a custom project for your client ,  it is extremely important that you document the results, even if your tests are correct. This is r tests are correct. This is  tests are correct. This is This is his is  because, very often, producing the correct test results is part and parcel of handing over the  code to your client.  Just a reminder—the test plan that we are going to use was created in the previous   chapter. You can find the test plan in the source code folder of Chapter 4, entitled   sample_test_plan.doc. If you are in a hurry and would like to see the entire completed  test plan where all tests have been carried out already, head to the source code folder of  Chapter 5 and open up sample-testplan-bug-form-filled.doc.  In case you do not wish to flip the pages or open up your computer just to see the list of the  tests, the list of tests are as follows:    Test Case 1      Test Case 1a: White Box Testing Test Case 1b: Black Box Testing      Test Case 1bi: Boundary Value Testing Test Case 1bii: Testing for illegal values      Test Case 2: Testing Program's logic Test Case 3: Integration Testing       Test Case 3a: Testing the entire program with expected values Test Case 3b: Testing the robustness of the second form.  With this in mind, let us proceed to the first test.  Test Case 1: Testing expected and acceptable values Testing expected and acceptable values refers to the white box test phase. We will now  execute the test as per our plan  this is First test scenario .  [ 140 ]   Chapter 5  Time for action – Test Case 1a: testing expected and acceptable  values by using white box testing In this section, we will start our test by using values that we have predetermined during   the planning phase. The source code that you are using for this part of the chapter is  perfect-code-for-jslint.html, which can be found in the source code folder of  Chapter 3. What we will do here is enter the expected and acceptable values. We will start  testing by using the input values for input value case 1 as per our sample test document.   Open the source code in your favorite web browser.  1.  2.  When you open your program in your web browser, the focus should be on the first   input field. Enter the name Johnny Boy as per our plan. After you have entered  Johnny Boy in the first input field, go on to the next field. As you change your focus to the next field, you will see a new input field appearing  on the right-hand side of the original input field that contains the value you have  entered. If this happens, then you have received a correct and expected output   for the first input. If you do not understand what this means, feel free to refer  If you do not understand what this means, feel free to refer   back to Chapter 4 expected output.  hapter 44, Planning to Test, and look at the screenshot given for the  and look at the screenshot given for the the screenshot given for the  screenshot given for the shot given for the hot given for the   3.  For the second input, we are required to enter a place of birth. Enter San Francisco,   as per the plan. Click on  or tab to  the next field. Similarly to the first input field, after you move to the next field you will see a new  input field containing your input value. This means that you have the correct output  at this point.  4.  This step is similar to the above step, except that the input value is now a number.   Enter your age as 25. Then move on to the next field. You should also see a new  input field on the right.  5.  Now repeat the previous steps for the remaining fields for the form on the left.   Repeat this action until you see a Submit button appearing in the middle of button appearing in the middle of   the screen. If a new input field is dynamically created for each of your input, and each of the , and each of the  and each of the  new input fields created dynamically contains the exact same input that you have  entered, then you have received the correct output. If not, the test has failed. en you have received the correct output. If not, the test has failed. n you have received the correct output. If not, the test has failed.  However, based on our tests, we have received the correct output.  [ 141 ]   Putting the Test Plan Into Action  6.  Now, refresh the page in your browser, and repeat the test for the input values the page in your browser, and repeat the test for the input values in your browser, and repeat the test for the input values   found in input value Case 2. You should also receive the correct output. Assuming that both test cases produce the correct output, then congratulations,  the correct output, then congratulations, the correct output, then congratulations, en congratulations, n congratulations,  there are no bugs or errors found in this phase of the test. There isn't anything There isn't anything  are no bugs or errors found in this phase of the test. There isn't anything  no bugs or errors found in this phase of the test. There isn't anything special or tedious in this part of the test because we already knew that we would  receive the expected output based on our input. Now, we will move to something  more exciting—testing expected but unacceptable values.  Test Case 1b: Testing expected but unacceptable values using  black box testing In this section, you will continue to execute our test plan. As you continue with the tests, you  will see that our program is not robust enough and has some inherent errors in it. You will  learn that you will be required to take note of these; the information will be used later when  we debug the program  this is second test scenario .   this is second test scenario .  this is second test scenario . this is second test scenario . second test scenario .  test scenario . .  Time for action – Test case 1bi: testing expected but  unacceptable values using boundary value testing For this part of the test, we will continue to use the same source code as we have used in the  previous section. We'll start by performing boundary values testing. Therefore, we will begin  section. We'll start by performing boundary values testing. Therefore, we will begin We'll start by performing boundary values testing. Therefore, we will begin Therefore, we will begin herefore, we will begin e will begin  the test by using the "minimum values", followed by "maximum values". We will skip the s", followed by "maximum values". We will skip the ", followed by "maximum values". We will skip the . We will skip the  common values test case as that was similar to what we did in the previous test.  1.  Once again, refresh the page in your web browser. the page in your web browser. 2.  We'll first enter a single character 'll first enter a single character l first enter a single character a for the input field of name. After you have   entered the value, use your mouse to click on the next input field. You should see an  input field dynamically created on the right-hand side of the first input field, as for , as for  as for as for  the previous test. The output for this test is similar to what you have seen and experienced in the he output for this test is similar to what you have seen and experienced in the  previous test. What we are trying to test for is whether the program accepts a  minimum value. For this phase of the test, we naïvely chose to accept a single  character as an acceptable input. Because this is acceptable, we should see an input  field that contains the value of a dynamically generated on the right-hand side of  the original input field. If you see that, you have the correct output. , you have the correct output.  you have the correct output. the correct output.  correct output.  3.  Similarly, we will enter a single character a for the input field for place of birth.   After you have entered the value, use your mouse to click on the next input field.  You will see an input field dynamically created on the right-hand side of the first  input field, as seen in the previous test.  [ 142 ]   Chapter 5  You should also receive the correct output for this input value. Now let us move on correct output for this input value. Now let us move on  output for this input value. Now let us move on  for this input value. Now let us move on  this input value. Now let us move on  to the next input value.  4.  We'll now enter the number 1 as planned for the input field age. Similarly, after you enter the number 1 as planned for the input field age. Similarly, after you  the number 1 as planned for the input field age. Similarly, after you  Similarly, after you imilarly, after you   have entered the value, move the focus to the next input field.  5.  We'll repeat the test by entering the values as planned.  In general, we should not receive any errors at this point of the test. Similar to the should not receive any errors at this point of the test. Similar to the  not receive any errors at this point of the test. Similar to the  first test which we have performed earlier, we should see familiar output for each  of the inputs. However, I would like to point out an important point for this phase of the inputs. However, I would like to point out an important point for this phase of  inputs. However, I would like to point out an important point for this phase of  the test: We have naïvely chosen a minimum value that might not be practical. Consider  the various input fields that accept a single character value. To a large extent, our  original program logic doesn't seem to suit the real world cases. In general, we  should expect to have at least two or three characters for input fields that accept  character values. Therefore, we will take this as a bug in our program and we'll take  note of this on our "Bug Report Form". You may open the sample-testplan-bug- form-filled.doc document and see how we can take note of this flaw. Now that we have cleared the minimum values test case, it is time to move to the minimum values test case, it is time to move to the  values test case, it is time to move to the  next test case—maximum values. —maximum values. maximum values.  6.  As usual, refresh your web browser to clear all of the values that were previously   entered. We'll now begin by entering an extremely long string, of more than   255 characters. As explained earlier, we should also receive a similar output—a s explained earlier, we should also receive a similar output—a  explained earlier, we should also receive a similar output—a—aa   dynamically-generated input field that contains our input value.  7.  Similarly, enter the values for the remaining input fields using long strings or large   values. You should not face any errors. While we do not have any obvious errors, you may have noticed that we have a d that we have a  that we have a  similar problem to the one we experienced earlier on. Our program does not have to the one we experienced earlier on. Our program does not have  we experienced earlier on. Our program does not have  a boundary value for maximum values as well. It appears that if you try to enter  if you try to enter  values that are larger than your maximum values, the program will still accept  them, as long as the values are not illegal. Similarly, if you try to enter a string that is  more than 200 characters, the program will still accept it because it is a legal value.  This means that our program does not limit the maximum number of characters  that a user can enter. This can be regarded as a bug. We'll also take note of this  We'll also take note of this  . This can be regarded as a bug. We'll also take note of this programing error in our Bug Report Form. You might want to pop over to have a  look on how we recorded this error. Now that we have completed the first phase of  Now that we have completed the first phase of Now that we have completed the first phase of  our test for expected and unacceptable values, it is time to move on to the second  phase of this test—testing for expected illegal values.  [ 143 ]   Putting the Test Plan Into Action  Time for action – Test case 1bii: testing expected but Test case 1bii: testing expected but : testing expected but  unacceptable values using illegal values  using illegal values There are three input cases for this phase of the test. What we will do in the first case of the  What we will do in the first case of the  test is enter numeric values for input fields that require character inputs and vice versa.  Input Case 1:  1.  We'll once again refresh our browser to clear out the old values. Next we'll begin to  enter the expected illegal values. For the "name" input field, we'll enter a digit. This  can be any number, such as "1". Go on and test it. After you have entered the digit,  try to move your mouse cursor to the next input field. As you attempt to shift the focus to the next input field, you should see an alert box  telling you that you have entered an incorrect type of value. If you see the alert box  as per our test plan, then there is no error at this point. en there is no error at this point. n there is no error at this point. error at this point.  2.   In order to test the next field, we will need to enter a correct value for the first field  before we can move on to the next field. Alternatively, we can refresh the browser  and go directly to the second field. Assuming that you are using the first method, the second field. Assuming that you are using the first method,  second field. Assuming that you are using the first method, that you are using the first method, you are using the first method,  let us enter a hypothetical name, Steve Jobs, and move on to the next input field.  Similarly, well try to enter a digit for the place of birth. After you have entered a  digit for the input field, try to move to the next field. Once again, you will see an alert box telling you that you have entered an invalid will see an alert box telling you that you have entered an invalid  see an alert box telling you that you have entered an invalid  input and that you need to enter a text input. So far so good; there are no errors or text input. So far so good; there are no errors or So far so good; there are no errors or are no errors or or  bugs, and we can continue to the next field.  3.  Well need to either refresh the browser and go directly to the third field, or we the third field, or we  third field, or we   will need to enter valid values for the name and place of birth fields before we   can move on to the third field. Regardless of the method used, we'll try to enter Regardless of the method used, we'll try to enter  of the method used, we'll try to enter   a string for the age field. Once you have done that, attempt to move on to the  done that, attempt to move on to the   have done that, attempt to move on to the next input field. You will get an alert box again, telling you that you have entered an input of   the wrong type. This is as per the plan, and is expected. Therefore, no errors the plan, and is expected. Therefore, no errors plan, and is expected. Therefore, no errors n, and is expected. Therefore, no errors  and is expected. Therefore, no errors , no errors  no errors   or bugs yet.  4.  Repeat the previous steps for the remaining fields, and attempt to move on to the   next field as you enter the expected but illegal values. For all of the remaining fields, you should receive alert boxes telling you that receive alert boxes telling you that  alert boxes telling you that   you have entered an input of the wrong type, which is what we expect and   have planned for.  [ 144 ]   Input Case 2: Case 2: Now that we have completed the first test scenario, it is time to move on to the second test  scenario, where we try to enter non-alphanumeric values. , where we try to enter non-alphanumeric values.  where we try to enter non-alphanumeric values.  Chapter 5  1.  The testing process is fairly similar to the first test. We will first refresh the The testing process is fairly similar to the first test.

We will first refresh the   browser, and then immediately enter the non-alphanumeric values for the first en immediately enter the non-alphanumeric values for the first n immediately enter the non-alphanumeric values for the first alphanumeric values for the first  values for the first  input field—the—the name input field. As per our plan, we will enter our plan, we will enter the input, and then attempt to move on to the next input field.  input, and then attempt to move on to the next input field. For the first input field, which requires a character input, you should see an alert or the first input field, which requires a character input, you should see an alert  box telling that only text input is allowed. If you see that, then our program works only text input is allowed. If you see that, then our program works  text input is allowed. If you see that, then our program works en our program works n our program works  as planned. Now let us move to the next step.  plan, we will enter ~!@$%^&*   as   2.  For the next input field, we'll repeat the previous step and we should expect the and we should expect the nd we should expect the   same output as well.  3.  Now for the third input field, we proceed to enter the same non-alphanumeric input the same non-alphanumeric input  same non-alphanumeric input   values. The only difference we should expect for this step is that the alert, which , which  whichwhich  informs us that we have entered a wrong input, will tell us that we need to enter , will tell us that we need to enter  will tell us that we need to enter  digits and not text.  4.  We repeat the previous steps for the remaining fields, and in general we should previous steps for the remaining fields, and in general we should  steps for the remaining fields, and in general we should   expect to see an alert box informing us that we need to either enter text or enter  digits, depending on which input field it is. If this is the case, then all is well; there , depending on which input field it is. If this is the case, then all is well; there  depending on which input field it is. If this is the case, then all is well; there en all is well; there n all is well; there   are no related errors or bugs for this test scenario.  no related errors or bugs for this test scenario.  Input Case 3: Now it is time to perform the third test scenario, where we enter negative values for input the third test scenario, where we enter negative values for input  third test scenario, where we enter negative values for input , where we enter negative values for input  where we enter negative values for input  fields that require numerical inputs.  1.  Once again, we'll refresh the browser to clear the old values. We'll proceed to enter   the values as planned for the first two input fields. We will enter Johnny Boy and  San Francisco for the input fields of name and place of birth, respectively.  2.  Once you have performed the previous step, enter previous step, enter   step, enter -11 for the remaining input fields.   As you enter -1 for these fields, you should see that our program does not detect  negative values. Instead, it gives an incorrect response telling us that we should  enter digits. In reality, our program should be robust enough to spot negative values. However,  previous tests, our program appears to have the incorrect response as shown in the previous tests, our program appears to have the incorrect response  tests, our program appears to have the incorrect response  to an illegal value. Our program does spot the error, but it returns an incorrect . Our program does spot the error, but it returns an incorrect  Our program does spot the error, but it returns an incorrect Our program does spot the error, but it returns an incorrect ur program does spot the error, but it returns an incorrect  response. The response given is an alert box, telling you that the input must be a  digit. This is technically incorrect, because our input is a digit, albeit a negative one. This is technically incorrect, because our input is a digit, albeit a negative one. his is technically incorrect, because our input is a digit, albeit a negative one. albeit a negative one.  a negative one.  [ 145 ]   Putting the Test Plan Into Action  This means that our program does spot negative values, but it returns an incorrect  response. This means that we have a serious bug here. We need to take note of this  bug in our sample documentation by documenting this error on the "Bug Report  Form". You may make a look at how I have documented this in the sample test  plan document. Whew! This subsection is kind of long and tedious. That's right, testing can be  tedious, and by now you should see that a good program design will incorporate the  issues that we tested in this section. You will notice that, at least for our purposes  here, checking of the input values to make sure that the input is what we need is  fundamental to our program's success; if the input values are wrong, there is no  point in testing the remaining program, as we are almost certain to receive a   wrong output for a wrong input.  Test Case 2: Testing the program logic In this subsection, we will attempt to test the robustness of the program in terms of the  program logic. Although we have somewhat tested the program logic by ensuring that the Although we have somewhat tested the program logic by ensuring that the lthough we have somewhat tested the program logic by ensuring that the  input is correct, there is one more aspect that we need to test according to our test plan,  to test according to our test plan,  test according to our test plan,  and that is the present age and the retirement age.  Time for action – testing the program logic the program logic In general, we will attempt to enter a retirement age that is less than the current age. Now  let us test the robustness of the program:  1.  Let us refresh the browser, and then we'll enter the values as per our plan. Well first Let us refresh the browser, and then we'll enter the values as per our plan. Well first et us refresh the browser, and then we'll enter the values as per our plan. Well first en we'll enter the values as per our plan. Well first n we'll enter the values as per our plan. Well first  enter Johnny Boy and thenenn San Francisco for the input fields of name andand place of  birth, respectively.  2.  Now, take note of this step: we will now enter 30 for age and continue with the and continue with the nd continue with thethe   other fields.  3.  When you reach the input field the input field   input field age at which you wish to retire, you will want to  enter a value that is less than the age field. As per our test plan, we will enter 25.  After this, we will attempt to move on to the next field. this, we will attempt to move on to the next field. , we will attempt to move on to the next field. Because we were able to successfully move on to the next field, this means that this means that means that  our program is not robust enough. Our program should not accept a retirement  age value that is less than the present age value. Therefore, even if our program  does produce a final outcome, we can be sure that the output is not what we want,,  because the logic is already incorrect. As such, we will need to take note of the logical error found in this phase of the test.  Well take note of this on the Bug Report Form once again. Now we will move on to  the final stage of our test.  [ 146 ]   Chapter 5  Test Case 3: Integration testing and testing unexpected values We have reached the final phase of our test. In this subsection, we will move on to  In this subsection, we will move on to , we will move on to  we will move on to  integrated testing by first testing the whole program by using expected and acceptable  values, followed by breaking the flow of form submission by changing the values of the  second form.  Time for action –Test Case 3a: testing the entire program with Test Case 3a: testing the entire program with : testing the entire program with  the entire program with  expected values There are four sets of test values for the first test. In general, we will enter all values, and  then submit the form to see if we are getting the response that we are expecting: the input  values for input Case 1 and input Case 3 will result in an output stating that the user is not  able to retire on time, and the input values for input Case 2 and input Case 4 will result in an  output stating that the user will be able to retire on time. With that in mind, let us start with  the first set of input values:  1.

Well repeat   these steps for the remaining values, until we see the  until we see the Submit button that is , until we see the button that is  dynamically generated on the second form.  3.  Once you see the Submit button, click on the button to submit the values. You   should see some text being generated in the Final Response box. If you see that the  output contains the name, retirement age, the correct output value for the required  amount of money we need to retire, and more importantly the response you will be  able to retire by 55 years old, as shown in the following screenshot, then there are as shown in the following screenshot, then there are shown in the following screenshot, then there are in the following screenshot, then there are en there are n there areare  no bugs in the program.  [ 147 ]   Putting the Test Plan Into Action  4.  Now let us move on to entering the values for Case 2. Similarly, well refresh the   browsers, and then begin to enter all of the values as planned. en begin to enter all of the values as planned. n begin to enter all of the values as planned.  5.

So let's move on to the input values for the third case. third case.  case.  6.  Refresh your browser again, and then start entering the values as planned. The   values to take note of include the salary per month and age at which you wish to  retire. In general, we have set the values in order to test if we can create the output  to either be able to retire on time or be unable to retire on time.  7.  Continue entering values until you see the Submit button that is dynamically  generated. Click on the Submit button to submit the form.

Now, let us move on to the final case—case 4. We'll basically repeat the steps   as done previously. I just need you to take note of the input values of salary per  month. Notice that the input value is 100000, and that the retirement age did not  change. We are trying to simulate a situation where the user will be able to retire   on time.  9.  Continue to enter the values until you see the the values until you see the   values until you see the Submit button that is dynamically button that is dynamically dynamically  generated. Click on thethe Submit button to submit the form. You will see the output button to submit the form. You will see the output  to submit the form.

And with this, we have completed the first part of  this test phase. In general, we have tested the whole program to see if we are getting the expected  output. We used different values to generate the two possible outputs of being able the two possible outputs of being able  two possible outputs of being able s of being able  of being able  to retire on time or being unable to retire on time.

So now, well attempt to change the values of the dynamically-generated form and dynamically-generated form and -generated form and  see what happens.  1.

Now that we know this might not be the  case, we'll make a note of this on our Bug Report Form".".  What just happened? In general, we have executed the entire test plan. Along the way, we have uncovered bugs  and errors that we will be fixing later. You may find the steps repetitive; that is true—testing  can be repetitive sometimes. But, luckily, our program is quite small and hence testing  it is manageable.  [ 150 ]   Chapter 5  Now that we have completed the test, it is time to think about what we can do about those  errors. We'll start talking about this in the next section. ing about this in the next section.  about this in the next section. this in the next section.  in the next section. the next section.  next section..  What to do when a test returns an unexpected result In general, when a test returns an unexpected or incorrect result, it means that there is a bug  or error in our program. Based on our tests, you must certainly have noticed that there are  weak points in our program. The weak points or errors that resulted in a test returning an  unexpected result are as follows:        Our program does not support negative values The code that we have written does not support boundary values  both maximum   both maximum  and minimum values  The second form does not check for correctness in the input values; if we make any  changes to the values in the second form, the program fails  These points mean that our code is not robust enough and we need to fix it; we will do this  right away in the next section.  Regression testing in action  In this section, we will get our hands dirty by performing regression testing. We will attempt  to simulate a situation that warrants regression testing by writing code that fixes the errors  found when we initially applied our test plan. After writing the code, we will first test the  code that we have written, after which we will test the entire application to see if it works   in coherence.  Time for action – fixing the bugs and performing regression fixing the bugs and performing regression ing regression  regression  testing We'll fix each of the bugs that we've uncovered, one by one. We'll start by writing a function  that allows our program to support boundary values. The completed source code, where all  of the errors have been corrected, is found in Chapter 5 of the source code folder, and is  entitled perfect-code-for-JSLInt-enhanced.html.  Before we move on to the actual coding process for the first bug, let us think about what we  can do to support boundary values.  Firstly, if we go back to our sample test plan, you will notice that in our "Bug Report Form",  we have documented that we can try to change the function that checks for form input such  that it can check for minimum and maximum values. For simplicity's sake, we will enable  boundary values by checking the length of the input. For example "Neo" would mean that  there are three input characters and "1000" would have four input digits.  [ 151 ]   Putting the Test Plan Into Action  Secondly, because the checking of the input of the first form is done at submitValues  ,  we'll attempt to add in the required checking mechanism of this function. With that in mind,   we can start the coding process:  1.  Open the original source code that we wrote in Chapter 3, Syntax Validation, in your  favorite source code editor, and look for the function submitValues  . Next, add  the following code after the debuggingMessages   function:        this is the solution for checking the length of the input        this will allow us to enable boundary values        starting with minimum values: we will accept character           length of more than or equal than 3        and less than 100 characters     if  elementObj.name === 'enterText'  {         if  elementObj.value.length <= 3  {             alertMessage "Input must be more than 3 characters!" ;             var element = document.getElementById elementObj.id ; document.getElementById elementObj.id ;         jQuery element .focus  ;     jQuery element .focus  ; jQuery element .focus  ; jQuery element .focus  ;                  return true;         }         if  elementObj.value.length >= 100  {           alertMessage "Input must be less than 100 characters!" ;                          var element = document.getElementById elementObj.id ; document.getElementById elementObj.id ;               jQuery element .focus  ; jQuery element .focus  ;              return true;;         }     }               now for checking the maximum value of digits        upper boundary is set at 10 digits     if  elementObj.name === 'enterNumber'  {         if  elementObj.value.length >= 10  {             alertMessage "Input must be less than 10 digits!" ;             var element = document.getElementById elementObj.id ; document.getElementById elementObj.id ;        jQuery element .focus  ;   jQuery element .focus  ;             return true;         }     }  [ 152 ]   Chapter 5  What happened in the previous code is that we have added in a few if statements.  These statements check for the type of input via the .name property, and then  check to see if it is more than the minimum input or less than the maximum output.  We have set a minimum input length of three characters and a maximum input  characters of less than 100 length for text inputs. For input that requires numerical  inputs, we have set a maximum input length of 10 digits. We did not set a minimum  input length since it is possible that the user may not have any income.  2.  Save your file and test the program. Try entering less than three characters or more   than 100 characters. You should receive an alert box showing that you have too  large or too small inputs. Similarly, test the input fields that require numerical inputs  and see if the program detects an input length of more than 10 digits. If you have  received the correct alert boxes for each of the different cases, then you have fixed  the error. Now that we have fixed the issue regarding boundary values, it is time to move on  to the next error that we have documented on our "Bug Report Form", which is the  third error  bug number 3 in our sample-testplan-bug-form-filled.doc -testplan-bug-form-filled.doc   that we uncovered, which relates to negative values.  we uncovered, which relates to negative values. uncovered, which relates to negative values. , which relates to negative values. The error is that our program sees a negative input as a non-digit value and  produces a wrong output message of input must be digit. Therefore, in this case  we would need to fix this error by tracing back to the source of the problem—the  the source of the problem—the  source of the problem—the—thethe  functions that are responsible for checking the input. Take note that the function that checks the input is submitValues  .Now, let us  move to the actual coding process:  3.  Go back to your source code and start with the submitValues   function. We'll   need to have a mechanism that checks for negative input, and this will have to mechanism that checks for negative input, and this will have to  that checks for negative input, and this will have to  return the correct output, which says that input must be positive. So here's what   we can do:        this is the solution for checking negative values        this only applies to input fields that requires numeric  inputs     if  elementObj.name === 'enterNumber'  {         if  elementObj.value < 0  {             alertMessage " "Input must be positive!" ;   var element = document.getElementById elementObj.id ;        var element = document.getElementById elementObj.id ; document.getElementById elementObj.id ;;        jQuery element .focus  ;   jQuery element .focus  ;             return true; true;;         }     }  [ 153 ]   Putting the Test Plan Into Action  By adding the above code, you will be able to check for negative values. The above  code should be placed within the submitValues   function, and before the if  statement which checks for the length of the input.  4.  Save your program and test it. Upon encountering fields that require numeric Save your program and test it. Upon encountering fields that require numeric ave your program and test it. Upon encountering fields that require numeric it. Upon encountering fields that require numeric  Upon encountering fields that require numeric fields that require numeric that require numeric  inputs, try entering a negative value, say -1. If you receive an alert box stating   that input must be positive, then we have done it right. en we have done it right. n we have done it right. The code for submitValues   should include the following lines shown below: function submitValues elementObj  {     code above omitted        this is the solution for checking negative values        this only applies to input fields that requires numeric  inputs     if  elementObj.name === 'enterNumber'  {         if  elementObj.value < 0  {             alertMessage "Input must be positive!" ;             var element = document.getElementById elementObj.id ; document.getElementById elementObj.id ;        jQuery element .focus  ;   jQuery element .focus  ;             return false;         }     }      code below is omitted  }  The lines in the previous snippet are those lines that we added in this subsection.  Because we have made sure that we are on the same frequency, we can move on  to the fourth error  bug number 4 in our sample_test_plan.doc , which is  regarding the program logic. At the start of this chapter, we found out that our program does not detect that  the retirement age can be smaller than the user's present age. This can be fatal for  our program. Therefore, we need to add a mechanism that makes sure that the  retirement age is greater than the user's present age. Because the issue lies with the checking of inputs, we will need to turn our attention  to submitValues  .  [ 154 ]   Chapter 5  5.  Let us go back to the source code, and add the following code to submitValues  :        this is to make sure that the retirement age is larger than  present age     if  elementObj.id === 'retire'  {         if  elementObj.value < document.getElementById 'age' . value  {             alertMessage 'Retirement age must be higher than higher than age' ;             var element = document.getElementById elementObj.id ; document.getElementById elementObj.id ;        jQuery element .focus  ;   jQuery element .focus  ;   than               return false;         }     }  You should enter this code prior to the code done up in the previous subsection.  code prior to the code done up in the previous subsection. code prior to the code done up in the previous subsection. Now, go ahead and test your code. Try entering a retirement age that is less than  the current age. You should receive an alert message that says retirement age must  be larger than age. If you received this alert, then congratulations, you have got it right! Once again,  to quickly sum up this section and to make sure that we are on the same page,  submitValues   should include the lines of code as shown next: function submitValues elementObj  {     code above omitted             this is to make sure that the retirement age is larger than  present age     if  elementObj.id === 'retire'  {        if  elementObj.value < document.getElementById 'age' . value {             alertMessage 'retirement age must be larger than  age' ;             var element = document.getElementById elementObj.id ; document.getElementById elementObj.id ;        jQuery element .focus  ;   jQuery element .focus  ;              return true; true;;         }     }      code below omitted       }  [ 155 ]   Putting the Test Plan Into Action  Now let us move on to the last error  bug number 5 in our sample-testplan- bug-form-filled.doc  that we have uncovered by checking the second form. We have created our JavaScript program such that as we enter the values for each  input field, a new input field is created dynamically. This means that after all of the  input fields have been completed, a new form will be created. In case you didn't  notice, the new input fields that are created allow users to change their values. The issue here is that the user may change the input values in the new form, which  can result in fatal errors as we have no checking mechanisms in place to check the  values in the second form. So, we naïvely chose to believe that the user will act  accordingly, and only enter valid values. But obviously, we were wrong. Therefore, in order to check the second form, we would most likely have to create a  new function that checks the second form. Although the second form is generated dynamically, we can still get the values  within those fields through the methods that we have learned so far. Remember  that because JavaScript has created the fields in the second form, these fields  technically exist in memory and are therefore still accessible. With that in mind, we'll need to create a function that works on these fields.  6.  Open the source code, and scroll to the last function, which uses jQuery statements. Open the source code, and scroll to the last function, which uses jQuery statements. pen the source code, and scroll to the last function, which uses jQuery statements. jQuery statements.

Before this function, create the following function: function, create the following function:  create the following function: function checkSecondForm elementObj  {      some code going here    some code going here }  7.  Well first start by checking for empty values. Therefore here's what we can do to   check for empty values: if document.testFormResponse.nameOfPerson.value === ""  {         alertMessage "fields must be filled!" ;         return false;     }         if document.testFormResponse.birth.value === ""  {         alertMessage "fields must be filled!" ;         return false;     }     if document.testFormResponse.age.value === ""  {  [ 156 ]   Chapter 5          alertMessage "fields must be filled!" ;         return false;     }     if document.testFormResponse.spending.value === ""  {         alertMessage "fields must be filled!" ;         return false;     }     if document.testFormResponse.salary.value === ""  {         alertMessage "fields must be filled!" ;         return false;     }     if document.testFormResponse.retire.value === ""  {         alertMessage "fields must be filled!" ;         return false;     }     if document.testFormResponse.retirementMoney.value === ""  {         alertMessage "fields must be filled!" ;         return false;     }  In general, we apply what we have learned in the third chapter by using === instead  of == when checking for empty values. We basically check the values that are found  in the dynamically-generated fields, and check to see if they are empty.  fields, and check to see if they are empty. Now that we have the code that checks to see if the fields are empty, it is time to  write code that checks for the correct type of input. 8.  We can apply the techniques learned in Chapter 3  hapter 3 3, Syntax Validation, to check for  to check for  the correctness of the input. In general, we are using regular expression, as we did  in the previous chapters, to check for the input's type. Heres what we can do: previous chapters, to check for the input's type.

Apart from performing regression testing as a part of an ongoing process as our program part from performing regression testing as a part of an ongoing process as our program  changes, there are other important issues regarding the testing of our program. Let us program. Let us . Let us   move to the first important issue—performance issues. —performance issues. performance issues..  Performance issues—compressing your code to make it load  faster As I mentioned in hapter 44, Planning to Test, the performance of the code that we write is I mentioned in  mentioned in Chapter 4  the performance of the code that we write is  dependent on various factors. Performance in general refers to the speed of the execution the speed of the execution  speed of the execution the execution execution  of your code; this is dependent on the algorithms you use for your code.

So now, let us see how we can compress our JavaScript code.  There are two ways in which we can go about doing this:  1.  We can compress our entire program, which means that we will compress our CSS, ire program, which means that we will compress our CSS,  program, which means that we will compress our CSS,,   HTML, and JavaScript together. , and JavaScript together.  and JavaScript together. together..  2.  We can remove all of the local JavaScript and place it in an external file, and then,,  compress only the external JavaScript. To keep things simple, I'll start by using the I'll start by using the ll start by using the ing the the   first method.   want you to visit http:  jscompress.com  and copy and paste our source code Firstly, I want you to visit I want you to visit nd copy and paste our source code   "Minify  JSMin ".

Check the size of the file for testing-compressed.html  and the code that we wrote earlier. Based on the source code that we have, the compressed  that we have, the compressed  we have, the compressed  version is 12KB, whereas the original version is 18KB. , whereas the original version is 18KB.  whereas the original version is 18KB.

If you are a developer who is working under the terms of an Non-Disclosure  Agreement  NDA , there is a likelihood that you are not allowed to use any  of the external services that I have previously mentioned. If this is the case,  you might want to consider using Yahoo's YUI Compressor, which allows  you to work directly from the command line. For more information, visit  http:  developer.yahoo.com yui compressor using.  Does using Ajax make a difference? Let me start by briefly explaining what happens when you are using Ajax. JavaScript is part of  the Ajax equation; the execution of JavaScript is responsible for sending information to and  for sending information to and  ; the execution of JavaScript is responsible for sending information to and  the execution of JavaScript is responsible for sending information to and he execution of JavaScript is responsible for sending information to and responsible for sending information to and loading information from the server. This is achieved by using achieved by using  by using   using XMLHttpRequest object.  When the sending and loading of data to and from the server is done using Ajax, the testing  responsibilities are different; you will not only have to test for the various errors that we have  covered in the previous chapters, but  you will also have to test if each error has resulted in  the successful sending and loading of information and the correct visual response to the user.  [ 161 ]   Putting the Test Plan Into Action  However, because you are sending and receiving requests to and from the server, you might  have to perform some form of server-side testing. This brings us to the next part of the  topic— the difference between JavaScript testing and server-side testing.  Difference from server-side testing As mentioned in the previous section, when you are performing tests for Ajax, you might  have to perform server-side testing. In general, the concepts that you have picked up to this  point in the book can also be applied to server-side testing. Therefore, conceptually, there  should be little difference between JavaScript testing and server-side testing.  However, do take note that server-side testing typically includes serve-side code and most  probably includes databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and others. This means that the  complexities involving server-side testing can take a different form when compared to  JavaScript testing.  Nonetheless, you will be expected to have a good understanding of the server-side language  used, the database used, and so on. This is the bare minimum for you to get started with  planning your tests.  If you are performing server-side testing as a part of Ajax testing, you will -side testing as a part of Ajax testing, you will side testing as a part of Ajax testing, you will  most certainly want to know about Hypertext Transfer Protocol response  status codes.

Although there are different points of view  on whether or not we should support such users, one of the best ways, in my humble support such users, one of the best ways, in my humble  such users, one of the best ways, in my humble  opinion, is that we should at least inform our users that their browser does not support  JavaScript  or that JavaScript is turned off  and they might be missing out on something.   In order to achieve this, we can use the following code snippet: achieve this, we can use the following code snippet:  this, we can use the following code snippet:        document.write "Your browser supports JavaScript, continue as usual!" ; !" ;;    do some other code as usual since JavaScript is supported      Your browser supports JavaScript, continue as   [ 162 ]   Chapter 5   JavaScript in order to enjoy the full functionality and   Sorry, your browser does not support JavaScript!

Let us see if you can improve upon your skills by trying out the  following assignment. assignment..

Here are some tips to help you get started with this exercise:  Right from the start, you can disable all of the input fields apart from the first one.  Then as the first field gets the correct input, you can enable the second input field. en as the first field gets the correct input, you can enable the second input field. n as the first field gets the correct input, you can enable the second input field.  Similarly, when the second input field is completed correctly, the third input field  gets enabled, and so on and so forth.        [ 163 ]   Putting the Test Plan Into Action    For the second issue, you might want to take a look at our code and see if  you can edit the conditions found in the if else statements for the function statements for the function  checkSecondForm  . What I have done is to lump all of the possibilities into a I have done is to lump all of the possibilities into a  have done is to lump all of the possibilities into a possibilities into a  into a  single if oror else if statement, thus making it impossible to detect which field statement, thus making it impossible to detect which field us making it impossible to detect which field s making it impossible to detect which field  has gone wrong. You can try to split up the conditions such that each of the of the if  and else if statements contain only a single condition. That way, well be able to statements contain only a single condition.

That way, well be able to  create a custom response for each individual input field in the second form, should the second form, should  second form, should , should  should  anything go wrong.  Summary  Wow, we have covered a lot in this chapter. We have executed the test plan and have  uncovered bugs. Next we successfully fixed the bugs that we uncovered. After fixing each   bug, we performed regression testing in order to make sure that the original functionality   was retained and that no new bugs were introduced into the program.  Specifically, we covered the following topics:            How to execute a test plan and how to document bugs that we uncovered that we uncovered we uncovered How to perform regression testing after fixing each bug ow to perform regression testing after fixing each bug How to compress the code in order to enhance performance Testing differences if we use Ajax Differences between client-side testing and server-side testing  The previous learning points may seem small, but now that you have gone through this   chapter, you should know that carrying out a test plan and subsequently fixing the   bugs can be tedious.

See you there!   issues in the next chapter, Chapter 6, Testing more   [ 164 ]   6  Testing More Complex Code  Welcome to the sixth chapter. In this chapter, we will learn more about  JavaScript testing. More specifically, we'll learn how to test more complex code,  where there will be more interactions between entities. Until now, we have  been performing tests on relatively simple code, using fairly straightforward  techniques.  More specifically, we'll cover the following:                Types of errors that can occur when combining scripts How we can deal with the errors that occur when combining the scripts together Various JavaScript libraries available on the Internet right now, and the issues that  we need to consider when testing them How to test the GUI, widgets add-ons for libraries, and other considerations How to use the console log Performing exception handling by using JavaScript built-in objects Testing an application by using JavaScript built-in objects  Let us get started with the basic concepts by covering the kinds of errors that can occur  when combining scripts.   Testing More Complex Code  Issues with combining scripts  So far, we have been focused on writing and testing only one JavaScript code within our  HTML document. Consider the real-life situation where we typically use external JavaScript;  what happens if we use more than one JavaScript file? What kind of issues can we expect  if we use more than one external JavaScript file? We'll cover all of this in the subsections  below. We'll start with the first issue—combining event handlers.  Combining event handlers You may or may not have realized this, but we have been dealing with event handlers since  Chapter 3, Syntax Validation. In fact, we actually mentioned events in Chapter 1, What is  JavaScript Testing. JavaScript helps to bring life to our web page by adding interactivity.   Event handlers are the heartbeat of interactivity. For example, we click on a button and  a pop-up window appears, or we move our cursor over an HTML div element and the  element changes color to provide visual feedback.  To see how we can combine event handlers, consider the following example, which is   found in the source code folder in the files combine-event-handlers.html and  combine-event-handlers.js as shown in the following code:  In combine-event-handlers.html, we have:             Event handlers      <script type="text javascript" src="combine-event-                  handlers.js">                Testing One         Testing Two         Testing                      Three          Notice that each of the div elements is handled by different functions, namely,  changeOne  , changeTwo  , and changeThree   respectively. The event   handlers are found in combine-event-handlers.js:  function changeOne element  {     var id = element.id;     var obj = document.getElementById id ;         obj.innerHTML = "";  [ 166 ]   Chapter 6  You might want to go ahead and test the program. As you click on the text, the content  changes based on what is defined in the functions.  However, we can rewrite the code such that all of the events are handled by one function.  We can rewrite combine-event-handlers.js as follows:      obj.innerHTML = " One is changed! ";     return true; }  function changeTwo element  {     var id = element.id;     var obj = document.getElementById id ;         obj.innerHTML = "";     obj.innerHTML = " Two is changed! ";     return true; } function changeThree element  {     var id = element.id;     var obj = document.getElementById id ;         obj.innerHTML = "";     obj.innerHTML = " Three is changed! ";     return true; }  function combine element  {     var id = element.id;     var obj = document.getElementById id ;     if id == "one" {        obj.innerHTML = "";        obj.innerHTML = " One is changed! ";        return true;     }     else if id == "two" {        obj.innerHTML = "";        obj.innerHTML = " Two is changed! ";        return true;     }     else if id == "three" {        obj.innerHTML = "";        obj.innerHTML = " Three is changed! ";        return true;         }          else{      ;    do nothing     } }  [ 167 ]   Testing More Complex Code  When we use if else statements to check the id of the div elements that we are working  on, and change the HTML contents accordingly, we will save quite a few lines of code. Take  note that we have renamed the function to combine  .  Because we have made some changes to the JavaScript code, we'll need to make the  corresponding changes to our HTML. So combine-event-handlers.html will be  rewritten as follows:             Event handlers      <script type="text javascript" src="combine-event-                    handlers.js">                Testing One         Testing Two         Testing                 Three          Notice that the div elements are now handled by the same function, combine  . These  rewritten examples can be found in combine-event-handlers-combined.html and  combine-event-handlers-combined.js.  Naming clashes Removing name clashes is the next issue that we need to deal with. Similar to the issue of  combining event handlers, naming clashes occur when two or more variables, functions,  events, or other objects have the same name. Although these variables or objects can be  contained in different files, these name clashes do not allow our JavaScript program to run  properly. Consider the following code snippets:  In nameclash.html, we have the following code:           testing                       Testing          [ 16 ]   Chapter 6  In nameclash1.js, we have the following code:  function change element  {     var id = element.id;     var obj = document.getElementById id ;         obj.innerHTML = "";     obj.innerHTML = " This is changed! ";     return true; }  If you run this code by opening the file in your browser and clicking on the text Testing, the  HTML contents will be changed as expected. However, if we add <script type="text  javascript" src="nameclash2.js">  after the    tag,  and if the content of nameclash2.js is as follows:  function change element  {     alert "so what?!" ; }  Then we will not be able to execute the code properly. We will see the alert box instead of  the HTML contents being changed. If we switch the arrangement of the external JavaScript,  then the HTML contents of the div elements will be changed and we will not be able to see  the alert box.  With such naming clashes, our program becomes unpredictable; the solution to this is to use  unique names in your functions, classes, or events. If you have a relatively large program,  it would be advisable to use namespaces, which is a common strategy in several JavaScript  libraries such as YUI and jQuery.  Using JavaScript libraries  There are many JavaScript libraries available right now. Some of the most commonly-used  ones are as follows:              JQuery  http:  jquery.com  YUI  Yahoo! User Interface JavaScript library   http:  developer.yahoo.com  yui   Dojo  http:  dojotoolkit.org   Prototype  http:  www.prototypejs.org   Mootools  http:  mootools.net   Script.aculo.us  http:  script.aculo.us    [ 16 ]   Testing More Complex Code  There are many more JavaScript libraries out there. For a complete list, feel free to visit  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki List_of_JavaScript_libraries.  If you have considered using JavaScript libraries, you may be aware of the benefits of using  a JavaScript library. Issues such as event handling, and the much dreaded cross-browser  issues make it necessary to consider using a JavaScript library. But you might want to know  what you should look out for when selecting a JavaScript library as a beginner JavaScript  programmer. So here is a list of things to consider:          The level of available support, in terms of documentation. Whether tutorials are available, and whether they are free or paid for. This helps you  to speed up the programing process. The availability of plugins and add-ons. Does the library have a built-in testing suite? This is very important, especially for  our purposes here.  Do you need to test a library that someone else has written? Firstly, while we are learning about JavaScript testing, I would say that for a beginner learning  JavaScript programing, it might not be advisable to test JavaScript libraries that someone  else wrote. This is because we need to understand the code in order to perform accurate  tests. People who are able to conduct objective  and accurate  tests are JavaScript experts,  and although you are on your way to becoming one, you are probably not there yet.  Secondly, from a practical standpoint, many such tests have already been done for us. All you  need to do is search for them on the Internet.  But for learning purposes, let us have a brief look at what tests are usually run against   library code.  What sort of tests to run against library code In general, as a user of various JavaScript libraries, we would most commonly perform  performance testing and profiling testing.  Performance testing Performance testing, as the name suggests, is about testing the performance of your code.  This includes testing how fast your code runs  on various browsers  in a manual way, or by  using certain tools such as Firebug or others  more such tools are covered in Chapter 8 .  [ 170 ]   Chapter 6  In general, in order to generate accurate results for performance testing, it is important for  you to test your code  most preferably by using tools and test suites  against all popular  platforms. For example, a common way to performance test JavaScript code id to install  Firebug in Firefox and test your code using that. But to think of it from a practical standpoint,  Firefox users only make up approximately a quarter  or a third at the most  of the total  number of Internet users. You will have to test your code against other platforms such as  Internet Explorer in order to make sure that your code is up to the mark. We'll cover more   of this in Chapter 8.  Profiling testing Profiling testing is similar to performance testing, except that it focuses on bottlenecks in  your code rather than the overall performance. Bottlenecks are, in general, the main culprits  for inefficient code. Fixing bottlenecks is  almost  a sure way to enhance the performance of  your code.  GUI and widget add-ons to libraries and considerations on how  to test them If you have checked the list of various JavaScript libraries that I pointed you to, you may have  noticed that some of the JavaScript libraries provide user interface or widget add-ons as well.  These are meant to enhance your application's user interface, and most importantly will help  you to save time and effort by implementing commonly-used user interface components,  such as dialog boxes, color selectors, and so on.  But that's where the problem starts—how do we test such user interface and widget add- ons? There are many ways in which we can go about doing that, but the simplest way  and  perhaps the most cumbersome  would be to test visually and manually. For example, if we  are expecting a dialog box to appear at the top left-hand side of the screen with a certain  color, width, and height, and it does not appear the way we want, then something is wrong.  Similarly, if we see something that we expect to see, then we can say that it is correct—at  least in a visual sense.  However, more vigorous testing is required. Testing user interfaces can be a daunting task,  and hence I would suggest that you use testing tools such as Sahi, which allows us to write  automated web application UI tests in any programing language. Tools such as Sahi are   out of scope for this chapter. We will cover Sahi in detail in Chapter 8. Meanwhile, if you   are eager to check out Sahi, feel free to visit their website at http:  sahi.co.in.  [ 171 ]   Testing More Complex Code  Deliberately throwing your own JavaScript errors  In this section, we will learn how to throw our own JavaScript errors and exceptions.  We will briefly cover the syntax of the error functions and commands. It may be a little  incomprehensible at this stage to just give you the syntax, but this is necessary. Once you  understand how to make use of these commands and reserved words, you will see how you  can make use of them to give yourself more specific information  and hence more control   over the types of errors that you can catch and create in the next section. So let us get  started with the first reserved word—throw.  The throw statements throw is a statement that allows you to create an exception or error. It is a bit like the break  statement, but throw allows you to break out of any scope. In general, this is what we  usually use to literally throw an error. The syntax is as follows:  throw exception ;  We can use throw exception  in the following ways:  throw "This is an error";  or:  throw new Error "this is an error" ;  Error is a built-in object that is commonly used in conjunction with the throw statement;  we will cover Error later. The important thing to understand now is the syntax, and the fact  that throw is also often used with try, catch, and finally, which will help you to control  the program flow and create accurate error messages. Now let us move on to catch.  The try, catch, and finally statement The try, catch, and finally statement are JavaScript's exception handling mechanism,  which, as mentioned previously, helps you control the program flow, while catching your  errors. The syntax of the try, catch, and finally statements is as follows:  try {      exceptions are handled here } catch  e  {      code within the catch block is executed if any exceptions are  caught in the try block } finally {      code here is executed no matter what happens in the try block }  [ 172 ]   Chapter 6  Notice that try is followed by catch, and then finally can be used optionally. In   general, the catch statement catches the exceptions that occur in the try statement.   An exception is an error. The finally statement is executed as long as the try or   catch statement terminates.  Now that we have covered the basic commands and reserved words for deliberately  throwing JavaScript errors, let us take a look at an example of how try, catch, and  finally can be used together. The following code can be found in the source code folder  of Chapter 6, in the HTML document named try-catch-finally-correct-version. html. Check out the following code:  try {          var a = prompt "Enter a positive integer", "" ;                    function factorial x  {         if x == 0  {           return 1;       }         else {           return x * factorial x-1 ;       }                 }      var f = factorial a ;      alert a + "! = " + f ; } catch  error  {          alert user of the error     alert error ;     alert error.message ; } finally {     alert "ok, all is done!" ; }                       [ 173 ]   Testing More Complex Code  You can copy and paste the code above into your favorite text editor, save it, and run it in your  browser. Or you can run the sample file try-catch-finally-correct-version.html.  You will see a prompt window asking you to enter a positive integer. Go ahead and enter a  positive integer, say 3 for instance, and you will receive an alert window telling you 3! = 6.  After that, you should receive another alert window, which contains the message ok, all is  done!, as the finally block will be executed after try or catch terminates.  Now, enter a negative number, say -1. If you are using Firefox, you will receive an alert  window that says that you have too much recursion. If you are using Internet Explorer, you  will receive an [object Error] message.  After the first pop-up window, you will receive a second pop-up window. If you are using  Firefox, you will see an InternalError: Too much recursion message. If you are using Internet  Explorer, you will receive an Out of stack space message.  Lastly, you should receive a final alert window, which contains the message ok, all is done!,  as the finally block will be executed after try or catch terminates. While it is true that  we have an error, the error message is not exactly what we need, as it does not tell us that  we have entered an illegal value.  This is where throw comes in. throw can be used to control the program flow and give   us the correct response for each type of error. Check out the following code, which   can also be found in the source code folder, in the file try-catch-finally-throw- correct-version.html.        function factorial x  {     if x == 0  {         return 1;     }     else {         return x * factorial x-1 ;     }                 }  try {      var a = prompt "Please enter a positive integer", "" ;     if a < 0 {         throw "negative-error";     }     else if isNaN a  {  [ 174 ]   Chapter 6          throw "not-a-number";     }     var f = factorial a ;          alert a + "! = " + f ; } catch  error  {       if error == "negative-error"  {         alert "value cannot be negative" ;          }     else if error == "not-a-number"  {         alert "value must be a number" ;     }     else         throw error; } finally {     alert "ok, all is done!" ; }             Now go ahead and execute the program, and enter correct values, negative values, and   non-alphanumeric values. You should receive the correct error messages depending on   your input.  Notice the previous lines of code where we used the throw statement to control the types  of error messages, which will be shown to the user in the catch block. This is one way in  which throw statements can be used. Note that the string that is defined after throw is  used to create program logic to decide what error messages should be called.  In case you are wondering what other capabilities this exception handling mechanism has,  remove the factorial function from try-catch-finally-correct-version.html.  Alternatively, you can open the file try-catch-finally-wrong-version.html and run  the program. Then try entering any value. You should receive an alert message telling you  that the factorial function is not defined, and after that you will receive another alert box  saying ok, all is done!. Notice that, in this case, there is no need for us to write any form of  message; catch is powerful enough to tell us what went wrong.  [ 175 ]   Testing More Complex Code  One thing to note, though, is that the JavaScript runtime may catch an exception if you do  not write an exception handler.  Now that we have covered the basics of the exception handling mechanism, let us move on  to the specifics—built-in objects for handling errors.  Trapping errors by using built-in objects  In this section, we'll briefly describe what each type of built-in object is, along with its syntax,  before we show some examples of how each of the built-in objects work. Do take note that  the alert messages, which we will be using sparingly in the examples, are based on the Firefox  browser. If you try the code on Internet Explorer, you might see different error messages.   The Error object An Error is a generic exception, and it accepts an optional message that provides details of  the exception. We can use the Error object by using the following syntax:  new Error message ;    message can be a string or an integer  Here's an example that shows the Error object in action. The source code for this example  can be found in the file error-object.html.        function factorial x  {     if x == 0  {         return 1;     }     else {         return x * factorial x-1 ;     }                 } try {     var a = prompt "Please enter a positive integer", "" ;     if a < 0 {         var error = new Error 1 ;         alert error.message ;      alert error.name ;         throw error;     }     else if isNaN a  {  [ 176 ]   Chapter 6          var error = new Error "it must be a number" ;         alert error.message ;         alert error.name ;                 throw error;     }     var f = factorial a ;          alert a + "! = " + f ; } catch  error  {       if error.message == 1  {         alert "value cannot be negative" ;          }     else if error.message == "it must be a number"  {         alert "value must be a number" ;     }     else         throw error; } finally {     alert "ok, all is done!" ; }            You may have noticed that the structure of this code is similar to the previous examples, in  which we demonstrated try, catch, finally, and throw. In this example, we have made  use of what we have learned, and instead of throwing the error directly, we have used the  Error object.  I need you to focus on the code given above. Notice that we have used an integer and  a string as the message argument for var error, namely new Error 1  and new  Error "it must be a number" . Take note that we can make use of alert   to   create a pop-up window to inform the user of the error that has occurred and the name   of the error, which is Error, as it is an Error object. Similarly, we can make use of the  message property to create program logic for the appropriate error message.  It is important to see how the Error object works, as the following built-in objects, which  we are going to learn about, work similarly to how we have seen for the Error object.    We might be able to show how we can use these errors in the console log.   [ 177 ]   Testing More Complex Code  The RangeError object A RangeError occurs when a number is out of its appropriate range. The syntax is similar to  what we have seen for the Error object. Here's the syntax for RangeError:  new RangeError message ;  message can either be a string or an integer.  We'll start with a simple example to show how this works. Check out the following code that  can be found in the source code folder, in the file rangeerror.html:        try {     var anArray = new Array -1 ;         an array length must be positive } catch  error  {       alert error.message ;     alert error.name ; } finally {     alert "ok, all is done!" ; }            When you run this example, you should see an alert window informing you that the array is  of an invalid length. After this alert window, you should receive another alert window telling  you that The error is RangeError, as this is a RangeError object. If you look at the code  carefully, you will see that I have deliberately created this error by giving a negative value   to the array's length  array's length must be positive .  The ReferenceError object A ReferenceError occurs when a variable, object, function, or array that you have  referenced does not exist. The syntax is similar to what you have seen so far and it   is as follows:  new ReferenceError message ;  message can either be a string or an integer.  [ 17 ]   As this is pretty straightforward, I'll dive right into the next example. The code for the following  example can be found in the source code folder, in the file referenceerror.html.  Chapter 6        try {     x = y;         notice that y is not defined        an array length must be positive } catch  error  {      alert error ;      alert error.message ;     alert error.name ; } finally {     alert "ok, all is done!" ; }                            ReferenceError: y is not defined y is not defined ReferenceError ok, all is done  [object Error] message y is undefined TypeError ok, all is done  [ 17 ]  Take note that y is not defined, and we are expecting to catch this error in the catch block.  Now try the previous example in your Firefox browser. You should receive four alert windows  regarding the errors, with each window giving you a different message. The messages are   as follows:  If you are using Internet Explorer, you will receive slightly different messages. You will see the  following messages:   Testing More Complex Code  The TypeError object A TypeError is thrown when we try to access a value that is of the wrong type. The syntax  is as follows:  new TypeError message ;    message can be a string or an integer and  it is optional  An example of TypeError is as follows:        try {     y = 1     var test = function weird   {         var foo = "weird string";     }     y = test.foo  ;    foo is not a function      } catch  error  {      alert error ;      alert error.message ;     alert error.name ; } finally {     alert "ok, all is done!" ; }            If you try running this code in Firefox, you should receive an alert box stating that it is a  TypeError. This is because test.foo   is not a function, and this results in a TypeError.  JavaScript is capable of finding out what kind of error has been caught. Similarly, you can use  the traditional method of throwing your own TypeError  , by uncommenting the code.  The following built-in objects are less used, so we'll just move through quickly with the  syntax of the built-in objects.  [ 10 ]   Chapter 6  The SyntaxError object A SyntaxError occurs when there is an error in syntax. The syntax for SyntaxError is   as follows:  new SyntaxError [message,[,,[,filename[, lineNumber]]] ;    message  can be a string or an integer and it is optional  Take note that the filename and lineNumber parameters are non-standard, and they  should be avoided if possible.  The URIError object A URIError occurs when a malformed URI is encountered. The syntax is as follows:  new URIError [message,[,filename[, lineNumber]]] ;  Similar to SyntaxError, take note that the filename and lineNumber parameters are  non-standard, and they should be avoided if possible.  The EvalError object An EvalError occurs when an eval statement is used incorrectly or contains an error  other than a syntax error.  new EvalError [message,[,filename[, lineNumber]]] ;   message can be a  string or an integer and it is optional  Similar to SyntaxError and URIError, take note that the filename and lineNumber  parameters are non-standard, and they should be avoided if possible.  Using the error console log  Firefox's console log is a tool that is powerful enough for you to log your JavaScript  messages. You can log error messages from the built-in objects, or you can write your   own messages.  Error messages What we see in this section are error messages generated that are logged in Firefox's error  console log. Before we do that, I need you to open up your Firefox browser, go to Tools on  the menu bar, and select Error Console. Make sure that you do not open any other tabs.  [ 11 ]   Testing More Complex Code  Now, open your code editor, and enter the following code into a new document:         try {     var anArray = new Array -1 ; ;  } catch  error  {       throw error; } finally {     alert "ok, all is done!" ; }            Save the document as a .html file, and then run the file on your Firefox browser.  Alternatively, you can use the source code found in the source code folder with the   HTML document entitled: error-message-console.html. If you now take a look at your  console, you should receive the following error message: invalid array length. This is because  we have defined an array that is of negative length, which is shown in the code above.  The trick here is to use the throw statement to throw error messages. Take note that  Firefox's error console does not show the name of the error.  Now we will take a look at how to create custom error messages.  Writing your own messages Let us move on to creating our own error messages. The completed code is found in the  source code folder, in the file test-custom.html.  Once again, open your code editor, create a new document, and enter the following code  into it:        function factorial x  {     if x == 0  {         return 1;  [ 12 ]   Chapter 6      }     else {         return x * factorial x-1 ;     }               } try {     var a = prompt "Please enter a positive integer", "" ;     if a < 0 {                 throw new Error "Number must be bigger than zero" ;     }     else if isNaN a  {               throw new Error "You must enter a number" ;     }     var f = factorial a ;          alert a + "! = " + f ; } catch  error  {       throw error; }            What we have done here is that within the try block we have thrown two new Error  objects, each with a custom message, and then in the catch block, we throw the Error  object again. In the try block, we are creating a custom Error object, and in the catch  block, we are throwing the message into the Error Console.  Take note of the highlighted lines. We have defined our own messages in the Error object.  Save the file, and then open up your Firefox browser. Go to Tools  Error Console. In the  Error Console, make sure you are in either the All tab or the Errors tab. Now run your code  in your Firefox browser. You will receive the message You must enter a number in your error  console if you enter a non-numeric input. If you enter a number that is less than zero, you  will receive the message Number must be bigger than zero. The key here is to make use of  the provided methods and properties to throw your own error messages.  [ 13 ]   Testing More Complex Code  Modifying scripts and testing  Now that we have covered the basic building blocks of throwing and catching errors using  built-in objects, and using the console to throw error messages, it is time to learn how we  can apply what we have learnt to a simple application.  Time for action – coding, modifying, throwing, and catching  errors I need you to focus and pay attention in this section because we will be applying all that we  have learnt previously when we first created an application. After that, we will attempt to  generate our own errors and throw various error messages as a part of our testing process.  What we will create is a mock movie booking system. I'm not sure about you, but I've   noticed that the folks at the service counter use some form of a movie booking system that  has a GUI to facilitate their booking process. Not only will we be creating that, but we will  also add more features, such as purchasing food and drinks to go with the movie tickets.  Here are the details of the movie tickets booking system: as you click on each seat, you   are executing a booking action. If the seat is booked, a click on it will execute a remove  booking action.  Other important design rules are as follows: you cannot buy more meals than the number  of tickets that you have booked. For example, if you have booked four tickets, you can only  purchase up to four meals, be it a hotdog meal or a popcorn meal. Similarly, for every meal  that you have purchased, you can purchase one Sky Walker. This means that if you have  purchased three meals, you can only purchase up to three Sky Walkers. Next, you can only  pay in hundred dollar notes. This means that you can only enter figures in hundreds for the  Please pay in $100 notes input field.  In case you are wondering about the pricing of the various merchandise, the tickets are  priced at $10 each. The hotdog meal costs $6 while the popcorn meal costs $4. Sky Walker  costs $10 each.  [ 14 ]   Chapter 6  Clear about the rules? If you are clear about the rules, we'll first start by creating this   application. After that, we will apply the exception catching mechanism as the final   step. By the way, the completed code for this example can be found in the folder   cinema-incomplete of Chapter 6.  1.  Open up code editor and create a new file. Enter the following code into your file. <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN"  "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-transitional.dtd">      JavaScript Cinema           This will form the backbone of our program.

You may  have noticed that there are various div elements with the class wrapper. These  elements will be used to create a grid-like user interface that represents the seats   in a cinema. So now we will start to create the grid that will be used to represent   the seats.  3.  We will first build the first row of the grid. For a start, type the following code within   the first div element with a wrapper class: <div class="left1" id="a1" name="seats" onclick="checkBooking this  ;">  Available    <div class="left2" id="a2" name="seats" onclick="checkBooking this  ;">  Available                <div class="left8" id="a8" name="seats" onclick="checkBooking this  ;">       Available   [ 16 ]   Chapter 6    <div class="left9" id="a9" name="seats" onclick="checkBooking this  ;">       Available     Notice that each of the   elements that you have typed within the first div  element with a wrapper class has a class and id property. In general, the first div  will have a class of left1, and an ID of a1. The next div element will have a class of  left2 and an ID of a2, and so on. This is the way that we will be designing our grid.  Now, let us proceed to the next step.  4.  Similar to step 3, we will build the next row of our grid. Enter the following code into   the second div element with a wrapper class: <div class="left1" id="b1" name="seats" onclick="checkBooking this  ;">      Available     <div class="left2" id="b2" name="seats" onclick="checkBooking this  ;">      Available                 <div class="left8" id="b8" name="seats" onclick="checkBooking this  ;">       Available     <div class="left9" id="b9" name="seats" onclick="checkBooking this  ;">       Available     Notice that the div elements that form the second row of the grid have an ID  starting with a "b" as opposed to an "a" as is the case in the first row of the grid. This  will be the way that we will name and continue to build the grid as we go along. This  means that the next row will have an ID beginning with "c", the fourth row will have  an ID beginning with "d", and so on. In all, we will be creating five rows. This means that we have three more rows to go.  [ 17 ]   Testing More Complex Code  5.  Now we will build the next three rows of the grid. Type the code given in the   previous step into the remaining div elements, but remember to change the id   of each element to suit the row number. At the same time, remember to include  the onclick="checkBooking this ", as this will be used for executing our  JavaScript functions. Once you are done with the HTML, it's time for us to add the CSS in order to create  the proper design and layout for our application.  6.  For this example, we will be using an external CSS. Therefore, insert the following   code after the     tags.    7.  Now we will create a CSS file. Open up a new document and save it as cinema.css,   as this is what we referred to in step 6. Next, enter the following code into   cinema.css: body{    border-width: 0px;    padding: 0px;    padding-left: 20px;    margin: 0px;    font-size: 90%; } container {   text-align: left;   margin: 0px auto;   padding: 0px;   border:0;   width: 1040px; }  side-a {   float: left;   width: 840px; }  side-b {    margin: 0;   float: left;   margin-top:100px;    width: 200px;   height: 600px;   background-color: cccc00; }  [ 1 ]   Chapter 6  This is the code for the CSS classes and ID selectors that are used to build the  scaffold of our application. You might want to refresh yourself by going back to  Chapter 1,What is JavaScript Testing, if you have forgotten how CSS works. Now, we will decide on the size of the seats on the grid, and other   important properties.  8.  We will define the width, height, background color, and text color of the seats.   Append the following code to cinema.css: a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6,a7,a8,a9, b1,b2,b3,b4,b5,b6,b7,b8,b9, c1,c2,c3,c4,c5,c6,c7,c8,c9, d1,d2,d3,d4,d5,d6,d7,d8,d9, e1,e2,e3,e4,e5,e6,e7,e8,e9 {     background:e5791e;     color:000000;     width: 71px;     height: 71px; }  The previous code defines the size, color, and background for all of the "seats" in   our cinema. Now we are down to the final step in creating the layout and design of  our application.  9.  We will now define the layout and colors of our grid, which contains our   seats. The completed CSS code can be found in the source code folder   cinema-incomplete, in the file cinema.css. Append the following code   to cinema.css: .wrapper{    position: relative;    float: left;    left: 0px;    width: 840px;    margin-bottom: 20px;    background-color: cccccc } … .left1{    position: relative;    float: left;    left: 10px;    z-index:0; } .left2{  [ 1 ]   Testing More Complex Code     position: relative;    float: left;    left: 30px;    width: 71px;    height: 71px; }  … …  .left8{    position: relative;    float: left;    left: 150px;  } .left9{    position: relative;    float: left;    left: 170px; }  This CSS code basically defines each column of the grid. Once you are done with  this, save it as cinema.css and cinema.html. Make sure that these files are in  the same folder. Open up cinema.html in your web browser, and you should see  something similar to the following screenshot:  [ 10 ]   Chapter 6  If you see something amiss, you might want to compare your code to the example  source code found in the folder cinema-incomplete. Now that we are done with the design and layout of our application, it is time for  us to add in the behaviors of the application. The completed code example for the  following section can be found in the folder cinema-complete of Chapter 6.  10.  We will be using an external JavaScript file. So let us add the following code snippet   before the   tag:     11.  Now let us create a new file, and name it cinema.js. We will focus on creating the   ticket booking mechanism. Because we will be booking tickets by clicking on the  seats, we need some mechanism to handle the click event. Because we have already  included the onclick="checkBooking this " in the HTML code, what we need  to do now is create a function that handles the click event. Add the following code  into cinema.js: function checkBooking element  {     var id = element.id;     var status = document.getElementById id .innerHTML;                 " Available "  is for an IE quirks     if status === " Available "  status === " Available<  P>"           addBooking id ;     else         removeBooking id ;       alert id ;     return true; }  Notice that the previous code checks for the innerHTML of the div element and  checks to see if it is  Available . If it is, this means that the seat is available  and we can proceed with booking the seat. If not, the seat is booked and a click on  the div element will result in removing the booking of the seat. With that in mind, we need two more functions that will help us with the booking  and removal of the booking of the seats.  [ 11 ]   Testing More Complex Code  12.  We will now create two more functions, to book or to remove booking of the seats.   Prepend the following code to cinema.js: var counterNumReservations = 0; function addBooking id  {        add 1 to counterNumReservations when a user clicks on the  seating        alert "addBooking" ;     document.getElementById id .style.backgroundColor = "000000";     document.getElementById id .style.color = "ffffff";     document.getElementById id .innerHTML = " Booked! ";     counterNumReservations = counterNumReservations + 1;     document.getElementById "tickets" .innerHTML = " You have  booked " + counterNumReservations + " tickets ">";     return true; } function removeBooking id  {        minus 1 from counterNumReservations when a user clicks on a  seating that is already booked        alert "removeBooking" ;     document.getElementById id .style.backgroundColor = "e5791e";     document.getElementById id .style.color = "000000";          document.getElementById id .innerHTML = " Available ";        counterNumReservations = counterNumReservations - 1;         document.getElementById "tickets" .innerHTML = " You  have booked " + counterNumReservations + " tickets ">";      return true; }  We have used a global variable to keep track of the number of tickets or seats  booked. What the previous functions are doing is that they will increase or decrease   as appropriate  counterNumReservations and, at the same time, change the  HTML contents of the div elements to reflect the status of the booking process. In  this case, the seat that is booked will be black in color. Now, save your file and click on the seats. You should be able to receive visual  feedback on the booking process. We will move on to the form handling mechanism.  [ 12 ]   Chapter 6  13.  The form handling mechanism basically handles the following: calculating total  spending, the total meal quantity, the amount of money that the user has paid,  the change  if any , and also other possible errors or conditions, such as whether  enough money is paid, if the money has been paid in hundreds, and so on. With   that in mind, we will create the following function: function checkForm  {     var mealPrice;     var special;     var hundred;     var change;     var ticketPrice     if calculateMealQty   == 1 && checkHundred   == 1 &&  checkSpecial   == 1 && checkMoney   == 1  {         alert "passed! for checkForm" ;         mealPrice = calculateMealPrice  ;         special = specialOffer  ;         ticketPrice = calculateTicketPrice  ;         change = parseInt amountReceived    - parseInt  mealPrice  + special + ticketPrice  ;         alert change ;         success change ;     }     else         alert "there was something wrong with your order." ;      return false; }  In order to create code that is modular, we have split the functionality down into  separate functions. For instance, success   and failure   are used to create   the HTML contents, which will show the status of the booking process. Similarly, notice that we will need to create other functions for calculating meal  quantity, checking total money spent, and so on. These functions are created based  on what we have learnt from Chapter 1 to Chapter 5, so I'll go on quickly. So now, let  us create these functions.  [ 13 ]   Testing More Complex Code  14.  We will now create various functions for calculating the meal quantity, the total   meal price, the total ticket price, and so on. We'll start with calculating the   meal quantity: function calculateMealQty   {     var total = parseInt document.foodForm.hotdogQty.value  +  parseInt document.foodForm.popcornQty.value ;     alert "you have ordered " + total + " meals" ;     if total > counterNumReservations  {         alert "you have ordered too many meals!" ;         failure "you have ordered too many meals!" ;         return 0;     }     else {         alert "ok proceed!" ;         return 1;     } }  Now, we'll write the function for calculating the meal price: function calculateMealPrice   {        add up total price     var price = 6*parseInt document.foodForm.hotdogQty.value  +   4*parseInt document.foodForm.popcornQty.value  ;     alert "meal price is " + price ;     return price; }  Next is the function for calculating the ticket price: function calculateTicketPrice   {     var price = counterNumReservations * 10;     alert "ticket price is " + price ;     return price; }  We'll now write the function for calculating how much was spent on Sky Walker by  the user: function specialOffer   {        for more ordering offers     var skywalker = 10 * parseInt document.foodForm.skywalker. value ;         alert "skywalker price is " + skywalker ;     return skywalker;     }  [ 14 ]   Chapter 6  Once this has been done, we'll write a small function that checks how much money  has been received: function amountReceived   {     var amount = parseInt document.foodForm.hundred.value ;     alert "I received "+ amount ;     return amount; }  Now that we are done with the functions that do the bulk of the calculations, it's  time to write functions to check if the user has ordered too much Sky Walker: function checkSpecial   {     if parseInt document.foodForm.skywalker.value  >   parseInt document.foodForm.hotdogQty.value  + parseInt document. foodForm.popcornQty.value   {         alert "you have ordered too many sky walker" ;         failure "you have ordered too many sky walker" ;         return 0;     }     else {         return 1;     } }  Once we are done with the previous step, it's time to check if the user paid too   little money: function checkMoney   {     var mealPrice = calculateMealPrice  ;     var special = specialOffer  ;     var ticketPrice = calculateTicketPrice  ;     var change = amountReceived   -  mealPrice + special +  ticketPrice ;          alert "checkMoney :" + change ;     if change < 0  {         alert "you have paid too little money!" ;         failure "you have paid too little money!" ;         return 0;     }     else         return 1; }  [ 15 ]   Testing More Complex Code  As stipulated at the beginning, we will also need to check to see if the user paid in  hundred dollar notes. This is done as follows: function checkHundred   {        see if notes are in hundreds     var figure = parseInt document.foodForm.hundred.value ;     if  figure%100  != 0  {         alert "You did not pay in hundreds!" ;         failure "You did not pay in hundreds!" ;         return 0;     }        can use error checking here as well     else {         alert "checkHundred proceed" ;         return 1;     }    }  Finally, the functions for creating the HTML content that reflects the booking status  are as follows: function failure errorMessage  {      document.getElementById "orderResults" .innerHTML =  errorMessage; }  function success change  {     document.getElementById "orderResults" .innerHTML = "Your  order was successful.";     document.getElementById "orderResults" .innerHTML +=  "Your change is " + change + " and you have purchased " +  counterNumReservations + " tickets."; }  Phew! That was quite a bit of coding! You might want to save your files and test your  application in your browser. You should have a full working application, assuming  that you have entered the code correctly. The completed code up to this stage can  be found in the cinema-complete folder. Although we have just been through a tedious process, it was a necessary process.  You might ask why you are coding first instead of testing immediately. My answer  is that firstly, in the real business world, it is very likely that we need to write code  and then test the code that we have written. Secondly, if I were to create a tutorial  and ask you to test the code without knowing what the code is, it might leave you  hanging on the cliff, as you might not know what to test for. Most importantly,  the approach that we have taken allows you to practice your coding skills and  understand what the code is about.  [ 16 ]   Chapter 6  This will help you to understand how to apply the try, catch, and other built-in  exceptions object in your code; we will be doing this right now.  15.  We will now create a function that will be used to throw and catch our errors by  using built-in objects. Now, open cinema.js and prepend the following code   at the top of the document: function catchError elementObj  {     try {            some code here     }     catch  error  {          if error instanceof TypeError {             alert error.name ;             alert error.message ;                         return 0;          }         else if error instanceof ReferenceError {             alert error.name ;             alert error.message ;                         return 0;         } … …         else if error instanceof EvalError {             alert error.name ;             alert error.message ;             return 0;         }         else {             alert error ;             return 0;         }     }     finally {         alert "ok, all is done!" ;     }     }  The previous code will form the scaffold of our catchError   function. Basically,  what this function does is to catch the error  or potential error  and test to see   what type of error it is. We will be seeing two sample usages of this function in   this example.  [ 17 ]   Testing More Complex Code  The first example is a simple example to show how we can use catchError    in other functions so that we can catch any real or potential errors. In the second  example, we will throw and catch a TypeError by using catchError  . The completed code for this stage can be found in the folder cinema-error- catching. Take note that the bulk of the code did not change, except for   the addition of the catchError   and some minor additions to the  addBooking   function.  16.  We will now try to catch a ReferenceError  or TypeError, if you are using  Internet Explorer  by adding the following code snippet within the try block:    x = elementObj;  Next, add the following code at the top of the function addBooking  :     var test = catchError  counterNumReservations ;     if test == 0          return 0;    stop execution if an error is catched;  What we are trying to do here is to stop execution of our JavaScript code if we find any  errors. In the above code snippet, we pass a variable, counterNumReservations,  into catchError   as an example. Now, save the file and test the program. The program should be working normally.  However, if you now change the code in the try block to:    var x =  testing;  where testing is not defined, you will receive a ReferenceError  if you are using  Firefox browser  or TypeError  if you are using Internet Explorer  when you  execute your application. The previous simple example shows that you can pass variables into the  catchError   function to check if it's what you want. Now, let us move on to something more difficult.  17.  We will now try to throw and catch a TypeError. Let us first remove the changes   that we made in the previous example. Now what we are doing here is checking  to see if the object passed into the addBooking   function is the nodeType  that we want. We can achieve this by adding the following code at the top of the  addBooking   function:     var test = document.getElementById id ;        alert test.nodeName ;    this returns a DIV -> we use  nodeName as it has more functionality as compared to tagName     var test = catchError test.nodeType ;     nodeType should return a 1     if test == 0          return 0;    stop execution if an error is catched;  [ 1 ]   Take note of the above lines in the code. What we have done is that we are getting the  nodeType of the id element. The result of this will be used as an argument for the  catchError   function. For some basic details about nodeType, please visit   http:  www.w3schools.com htmldom dom_nodes_info.asp.  Now, remove whatever changes you have done to catchError  , and add the following  code to the try block:  Chapter 6      var y = elementObj;        var correct is the type of element we need.     var correct = document.getElementById "a1" .nodeType;   alert "Correct nodeType is: " + correct ;                var wrong = 9;    9 represents type Document                 if y != correct {        throw new TypeError "This is wrong!" ;            }  Notice that we are testing for the nodeType by checking the resulting integer. Anything   that is not correct  the correct variable is 1  will result in an error, as shown in the if  statement block.  Save the file, and then run your example. You should first receive an alert box telling you  that the Correct nodeType is 1, followed by the message TypeError. Next, you will see the  message This is wrong  which is a personalized message  and finally the message ok, all is  done indicating the end of the catchError   function.  What we have done is that we have thrown our own errors in response to different error  types. In our case here, we wanted to make sure that we are passing the correct nodeType.  If not, it is an error and we can throw our own error.  With that, we'll end this example.  Have a go hero – using catchError function to check input Now that you have covered quite a bit of code and gained new knowledge, you might want  to try this out: use the catchError   function to check the user's input for correctness.  How would you go about doing that? Here are some ideas to help you get going:      You might want to make sure that the input values go through catchError    before passing them to some other function. Will you implement catchError   within other functions? Or are the values passed  to catchError   immediately upon input and then passed to other functions?  [ 1 ]   Testing More Complex Code  Summary  We have covered quite a few concepts in this chapter. The most important is using  JavaScript's exception handling mechanisms through the built-in objects, and using these  objects together with try, catch, and finally statements. We then tried to apply these  concepts into the cinema ticket booking application that we created.  We also learnt the following topics:              Issues that occur when using scripts together, such as name clashing and combining  event handlers to make the code more compact Why we need to use JavaScript libraries, and the issues to consider, such as the  availability of documentation, tutorials, plugins, and a testing suite How we can make use of tools such as Selenium to test GUI and widgets add-ons for  libraries  these will be covered in more detail in Chapter 8  How we can write error messages, or our own messages, to the console log How to perform exception handling by using JavaScript built-in objects and using  these together with the try, catch, and finally statements How to use JavaScript's exception handling mechanisms in a sample application  Up to this chapter, we have been using manual ways to test our code, albeit now using more  advanced testing methods. In the next chapter, we will learn how to use different debugging  tools to make debugging, which is a part of testing, easier. This will include using tools  such as the IE8 Developer Tools, the Firebug extension for Firefox, the Google Chrome Web  Browser Inspector, and the JavaScript debugger.  What makes such tools powerful is that they allow us to test in a less obtrusive manner; for  instance, there's no need for us to use alert  , as we can, in general, write error messages  to the built-in consoles of these tools. This is a real time-saver and will make our testing  process a lot smoother. We will learn about these different debugging tools in the next  chapter. See you there!

This means that the code does not have to depend on jQuery. In general, QUnit  can be used to perform assertion tests and asynchronous testing. Also, assertion testing  helps in predicting the returning result of your code. If the prediction is false, it is likely that  something in your code is wrong. Asynchronous testing simply refers to testing Ajax calls or  functions that are happening at the same time.  Let us act immediately to see how it works.  Time for action – testing JavaScript with QUnit esting JavaScript with QUnit  In this section, we'll learn more about QUnit, by writing a bit of code, and the also learn  about various tests that QUnit supports. We will write tests that are correct and tests that  are and wrong, in order to see how it works. The source code for this section can be found in  the source code folder qunit.  1.  Open your editor and save the file as example.html. Enter the following code in it:           QUnit Example    <link rel="stylesheet" href="http:  github.com �query qunit raw  master qunit qunit.css" type="text css" media="screen">   <script type="text �avascript" src="http:  github.com �query  qunit raw master qunit qunit.�s">                    QUnit Test Results                           What the previous code does is that it simply sets up the code for testing. previous code does is that it simply sets up the code for testing.  code does is that it simply sets up the code for testing. the code for testing.  code for testing.

In the following steps, you will see how these two JavaScript two JavaScript  JavaScript   files work together.  2.  We'll start by writing code in codeToBeTested.js. Create a JavaScript file and        function that tests name it as codeToBeTested.js. For a start, we'll write a simple function that tests 'll write a simple function that tests ll write a simple function that tests  that tests  whether a number entered is odd or not. With that in mind, enter the following the following   a number entered is odd or not. With that in mind, enter the following enter the following code into: codeToBeTest.js: function isOdd value {   return value % 2 != 0; }  isOdd   takes in an argument value and checks if it is odd. If it is, this n argument value and checks if it is odd. If it is, this  argument value and checks if it is odd. If it is, this f it is, this  function will return 1. Let us now write a piece of code for out test case. et us now write a piece of code for out test case.  3.

Now, enter the following enter the following the following  code into it: test 'isOdd  ', function   {   ok isOdd 1 , 'One is an odd number' ;   ok isOdd 7 , 'Seven is an odd number' ;   ok isOdd -7 , 'Negative seven is an odd number' ; }   Take note of the way that we write the test case using QUnit's provided 's provided s provided  methods. First, we define a function call test  , which constructs the  test case. Because we are going to test the function isOdd  , the first  parameter is a string that will be displayed in the result. The second   function that contains our assertions. parameter is a call-back function that contains our assertions.  is a call-back function that contains our assertions. call-back function that contains our assertions.

At this point you should see that the good thing about QUnit is that it largely automates the  testing process for us without us having to perform testing by clicking on buttons, submitting  forms, or using alert  . It will certainly save us a tremendous amount of time and effort  when using such automated tests.  [ 23 ]   Testing Tools  What just happened? We have just employed QUnit in performing automated testing of self-defined JavaScript  functions. It was a simple example, but enough to get you started.  Applying QUnit in real-life situations You might wonder how you will make use of such tests on your code in real-life situations.   I would say that it is very likely that you will use ok   to test your code. For instance, you   can test for the truth values, if the user input is alphanumeric, or if the user has entered  invalid values.  More assertion tests for various situations Another thing that you can take note of is that ok   is not the only assertion test that you  can perform. You can also perform other tests, such as comparison assertion and identical  assertion. Let us see another short example on comparison.  We'll learn to use another assertion statement, equals  , in this section.  1.  Open your editor and open testCases.js. Comment out the code that you have that you have  you have   written previously, and enter the following code into the file: enter the following code into the file:  following code into the file: test 'assertions', function  {   equals 5,5, 'five equals to five' ;   equals 3,5, 'three is not equals to five' ; }   This code takes the same structure as the code that you have commented his code takes the same structure as the code that you have commented is code takes the same structure as the code that you have commented code takes the same structure as the code that you have commented  that you have commented  you have commented  out. But notice that we have used thethe equals   function instead of ok  .  The parameters of he parameters of equals   are as follows:        The first parameter is the actual value The second parameter is the expected value The third parameter is a self-defined message  , of which the first will pass the test,  We have used twotwo equals   functions, of which the first will pass the test, s, of which the first will pass the test, but the second will not as three and five are not equal.  are not equal. are not equal.  the second will not as three and five are not equal. as three and five are not equal.  three and five are not equal. three and five are not equal.  and five are not equal. five are not equal.  not equal.

You can even check out the performance in chart form  by visiting the URL that is created dynamically. If you received something  similar to the previous screenshot, then you have just done an ad hoc  benchmarking test..  If you are running this test on Internet Explorer and you happen to receive the  following  or similar  message: Script is taking too long to execute, then you  will need to tweak your Windows registry, in order to allow the test to run. Visit  http:  support.microsoft.com default.aspx?scid=kb;en- us;175500 for details on how to tweak your windows registry settings.  What just happened? We just used JSLitmus to create an ad hoc benchmarking test. Notice how easy it is for you  to perform ad hoc benchmarking test using JSLitmus. The cool thing about JSLitmus is the  simplicity of it; no additional tools, no windows to open, and so on. All you need to do is to  write JSLItmus.test   and type in the message and name of the function you want   to test.  More complex testing with JSLitmus  example is a really simple example to help you to get started.

[ 244 ]   Chapter 8                Selenium Server: Also known as Selenium Remote Control, Selenium Server is a test  tool that allows you to write automated web-application UI tests in any programing  language, against any HTTP website, using any mainstream JavaScript-enabled  browser. You can visit http:  seleniumhq.org projects remote-control . Watir: Watir is an automated testing tool available as a Ruby gem.   There is detailed documentation on Watir, which can be found at   http:  wiki.openqa.org display WTR Project+Home. Assertion Unit Framework: The Assertion Unit Framework is a unit   testing framework based on assertions. At the point of writing,   documentation appears to be limited. But you can learn how to use it at   http:  jsassertunit.sourceforge.net docs tutorial.html. You can  visit http:  jsassertunit.sourceforge.net docs index.html for other  relevant information. JsUnit: JsUnit is a unit testing framework ported from the most popular Java unit  testing framework known as JUnit. JsUnit includes a platform for automating the  execution of tests on multiple browsers and multiple machines using different  operating systems. You can get JsUnit at http:  www.jsunit.net . FireUnit: FireUnit is a unit testing framework designed to run in Firebug on Firefox.   It is also a popular debugging tool for Firefox and there are numerous tutorials   for it and documentation on it, on the Internet. You can get FireUnit at   http:  fireunit.org . JSpec: JSpec is a JavaScript testing framework that utilizes its own custom grammar  and pre-processor. It can also be used in variety of ways, such as via a terminal,  via browsers using DOM or Console formatters, and so on. You can get JSpec at  http:  visionmedia.github.com jspec . TestSwarm: TestSwarm provides distributed, continuous integration testing for  JavaScript. It was originally developed by John Resig to support the jQuery project and,  has now become an official Mozilla Labs project. Take note that it is still under heavy  testing. You can get more information at http:  testswarm.com .  [ 245 ]   Testing Tools  Summary  We have finally reached the end of this chapter.
