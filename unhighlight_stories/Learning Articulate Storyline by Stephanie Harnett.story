About the Reviewers  After many years in education and sales, Diana D. Jaffee has sidestepped into   the e-learning and multimedia design arena. Always fascinated with computers   and their use in education, Diana implemented teaching music theory and history   in her private voice and piano studio through the use of MIDI technology and music  education software.  Since starting her own e-learning development company with partner Darla  Wigginton as eVision-Design, Diana has been taking PowerPoint to educational  levels she never thought possible. With the release of Storyline, her goal is to find   out how far she can take this technology in the world of e-learning, to provide the  most effective learning possible.  Jade Kelsall has worked in higher education in the UK since she graduated in  2007. She started working in administration at the University of Leeds Library.

And you're about to discover why.  As you work through this book and get hands-on with Storyline, you'll be amazed  at what you're capable of producing with little or no prior development experience,  and just how quickly you can do it.  Storyline is an authoring tool packed with out-of-the-box features that don't require  any special knowledge to operate. Hold on…what was that? That's right, this is a  programming-free zone that everyone can jump into. No longer is e-learning authoring  limited to developers, the doors are now wide open for subject matter experts with  their content, instructional designers with their storyboards, and graphic designers  with their media to work, in conjunction with developers, to collectively create some  very cool e-learning projects.  Knowing this, you may want to keep it a secret and dazzle others with amazing  productions that magically work on desktops and mobile devices. There will be  oooo's and ahhhh's guaranteed and you will leave others impressed with how you  were able to do so much, so well, and in record time.  This is a book about how to use Storyline, but it should be noted that knowing how   to use Storyline features and understanding how to use Storyline for e-learning  are two different things. It's like providing a guitar to someone who knows the  basics. You can expect they will have mastered several chords and can play a few  songs pretty well. But the same instrument with all the same features in the hands  of someone such as Eric Clapton will result in something quite different. It doesn't  matter how well you know Storyline, if the learning experience isn't well designed  from a content point of view, you won't produce effective learning material.   Preface  The good thing about Storyline is that it isn't going to take years of training to master,  like it would for an accomplished musician. It will, however, take some extra time and  attention on your part to master the art of producing great results with Storyline.  Beware, Storyline is a bit like a shiny new Ferrari. It's tempting to hop in, put  the pedal to the medal, and create some screaming e-learning, after all, the bells  and whistles are there to use. It can be easy to go down a path that is fun, but it  likely won't result in practical solutions. You'll want to keep your focus on using  the features appropriately and in a way that truly helps convey a key concept or  demonstrate a difficult process, or otherwise aid the learning process.  The aim of this book is to provide you with one-on-one tutoring to help you with  the basics while also learning how to best apply Storyline features in the context  of the work you do. When you finish this book you will confidently create shining  examples of e-Learning which bring content to life in interesting and engaging ways.  It is this skill that will set you apart from the crowd.  What this book covers In Chapter 1, Creating a Story, you'll be introduced to the concept of a story or  e-Learning course, along with a quick overview of the Storyline interface and   start-up configuration tasks to prepare for creating your first story. Specifically,   we'll take a look at how to create a story from scratch, how to create a new story  based on a template, and how to open work you may have previously created in  PowerPoint and other Articulate products. In Chapter 2, Adding Content into your Story, you'll begin building the content for   your first e-Learning story. To do this, you'll work with design and master slides   and place a variety of content elements into your story. You'll also learn how to   align, format, and animate these elements. In Chapter 3, Adding Interactivity, you'll be introduced to two powerful features   in Storyline: states and triggers. These features are the basis of interactive content  development and you'll learn how easy it is to create basic interactions in a few  simple steps. In Chapter 4, Adding Characters and Audio, you'll discover how to bring story content   to life by adding and editing characters. You'll also explore how to incorporate   and edit audio files for sound effects and narration. You'll also learn how to add   text-based captions to a story.  [ 2 ]   Preface  In Chapter 5, Extending Slide Content, you'll be introduced to an important concept  called layers. Layers are useful in organizing content within one slide as opposed  to spreading content over multiple slides. You will learn when and why you would  choose to use a layer, how they work, and what's required to display layer content. In Chapter 6, Using Variables to Customize the Learning Experience, you'll explore   how using variables can help you create an engaging experience that responds   to your learners' actions. In Chapter 7, Creating Learning Paths, you'll learn about the concept of branching;   re-routing a learner down a different path depending on how they respond to  a question or prompt in your story. You'll learn how to create an opportunity  for learner input then set up basic branching to guide the learner in a particular  direction. You'll also learn how to customize slide layout   to control learner navigation. In Chapter 8, Testing Learner Knowledge, you'll take a first look at Storyline quizzing,  including a review of a variety of quiz questions formats, and learn how you   create, edit, score, and track quiz questions. You'll also learn how to import  previously created quizzes from Articulate Quizmaker. In Chapter 9, Adding Visual Media to a Story, you'll take a look at some seriously   fun features of Storyline that allow you to add visual media such as video,   screen recordings, and websites. You'll learn about supported file types   along with steps for importing media and working with web objects. In Chapter 10, Publishing your Story, you'll take a closer look at how a story looks when  previewed and published. You'll learn about the options available to the customized  colors and controls that surround your course content. Storyline supports multiple  publishing outputs. The methods and the process to publish a course to the web,  tablets and mobile devices full stop LMS and Word are also covered. In Chapter 11, Rapid development, is about how you can easily reuse, share, and edit  e-learning  assets to expedite development of courses. This chapter provides some  thoughts  on using Storyline effectively to produce quality results while increasing  your productivity. The Appendix, is a collection of tutorials, links, and ideas for inspiration to help you  with your Storyline skills.

This chapter provides a brief look at the key features of the Storyline interface,  followed by the steps needed to create your first Storyline project.  Included in this book are exercises that you can follow along. To do this, you will  need Internet access and Storyline installed so that you can download and work   with Articulate sample templates.  In this chapter we will discuss:     Storyline launch options and some basics about the Storyline interface    How to create a story from scratch and from a template    What initial settings should be reviewed before adding content to a story    How to import existing content from PowerPoint, Articulate Engage,    and Quizmaker     How to save your first story  Downloading the graphics and exercises of the book You can download the graphics files and exercise of this book from  your account at http:  www.packtpub.com.

Creating a Story  Launching Storyline Storyline presents a launch screen each time you start the program. This screen  provides options for creating new projects, opening existing projects, and importing  content previously created in PowerPoint or Quizmaker. You'll also find a series of  helpful getting started tutorials and pre-built templates that you can download and  install on your computer.  Creating a new story You can create a new story in several ways, including the following:     To create a new story that is devoid of content and formatting, choose    the New project option     To create a new story with content you previously produced in PowerPoint  or Articulate Quizmaker, choose Import PowerPoint or Import Quizmaker  respectively     To create a new story where the initial content is a recording of your   computer screen, choose Record screen     And finally, to create a new story with Storyline template-driven content    and formatting, choose From project template  [ 8 ]   Storyline interface If you're following along, choose the New project option to create a new, blank story  file. This option is best when you want to create an original story file with your own  design. When New project is selected from the Storyline launch screen, the initial  view you see looks the same as the following screenshot and contains just a single,  blank slide:  Chapter 1  This view is called Story View and it's the default view.  You can hide the ribbon by right-clicking anywhere in the ribbon  and choosing Minimize the Ribbon. You can reveal it again by  repeating this. Any item on the ribbon can be included on the  quick access toolbar by right-clicking on a ribbon option and  choosing Add to Quick Access Toolbar.  [ 9 ]   Creating a Story  Story View Story View is a new concept for those transitioning from Articulate Studio and one  that you're likely to grow quite fond of. Story View, similar to the Slide Sorter View  in PowerPoint, shows all the slides in your project, providing a big picture view of  the entire project.  The following screenshot is a sample course in a Story View. You can see the slides  are organized into groups. The groups are called scenes. Scenes help to visually  organize content into logical segments similar to chapters in a book. There are no  hard and fast rules of when and how to use scenes other than logical breakpoints.  You could have all of your content on slides within a single scene; but as you start  working with Storyline, you will appreciate the ability to group topics together.  Outside of visual organization, scenes also play a role in the menus of a project as  each scene by default becomes a submenu in the navigational structure. This can  be overridden of course, but by default it offers another compelling reason to use  scenes; to expedite navigational refinement that is part of the publishing process.  You can clearly see from this vantage point how content flows from one slide to  another. As projects become larger and more complex, you will find Story View  indispensable for organizing and managing project content.  [ 10 ]   Chapter 1  Normal View  also known as Slide View  When working on an individual slide, you'll most often use the Normal View. This  view is quite similar to PowerPoint and will be familiar to Articulate Studio users.  Normal View can be accessed in a few different ways, including the following:     The easiest method is to double-click on the slide while in Story View    You can switch to Normal View using the Slide button in the lower-right   corner of the screen     From the ribbon, you can click on the View tab and then choose Normal  [ 11 ]   Creating a Story  Once in Normal View, you can toggle back to Story View by clicking on the Story  View tab, clicking on the Story View button, or choosing View  Story View from  the ribbon as shown in the following screenshot:  In both views, you will notice a zoom slider in the lower-right corner. You can use  this to adjust the viewing size of the slide or the viewing size of the scenes and slides,  depending on if you are in Normal or Story View. The far right side of the slider displays a fit to window button that you may find  useful to quickly fit the slide or Story View content back into the available   screen space.  The slider is a quick method of controlling zoom levels. You can also do this by  holding the Ctrl key and moving the track wheel up or down  using a mouse   that has a track wheel .  [ 12 ]   Chapter 1  Preparing a story When you create a new story there is one thing you need to review, and ideally  adjust, before adding content to your story and this is called story size.  Story size The default size for a story is 720 px x 540 px. This refers to the slide size, and is the  same 4:3 aspect ratio and slide size as a default PowerPoint file. The project size will  be larger in dimension when published, since the player  the interface that appears  around the perimeter of the slides  can consume up to 260 pixels in width and 118  pixels in height.  You can adjust the story size at any time, but it's best to do this before adding  content. This is because existing slide content is rescaled to fit the new slide  dimensions, which could result in text appearing smaller or larger than you'd   like and graphics being stretched disproportionately.  [ 13 ]   Creating a Story  Adjusting the story size The setting to adjust the story size and the option to control it is found under   the Design tab. You can adjust the story size from the default to any size you'd like. The 720 px x 540  px default is a 4:3 aspect ratio, while the 720 px x 405 px preset is a widescreen 16:9  aspect ratio. If selecting a custom size, you can decide whether or not you want to  lock the aspect ratio.  There are two options that you can work with to control the result of resizing,  depending on whether the new size is larger or smaller than the existing   story dimensions.  When sizing a story, you have the option to scale the contents of a slide to fit  proportionately within the new size. Sometimes, scaling produces undesirable  results, such as stretching images. You may opt to work with non-scaling options  instead. If the size of the story is larger, you can choose to scale the background only,  leaving the objects on a slide unchanged. If the size is smaller, you have the option to  crop content to fit within the new size.  [ 14 ]   Here are some examples of the effects sizing has on slides with content:  Chapter 1  As you can see, it's possible to adjust story size when you have content on a slide,   but it takes a little tweaking to get the right result. You'll save time by adjusting   the size of your story to its final dimensions before you begin developing content.  Creating a story based on a template Templates consist of one or more slides with design elements and functional  elements such as animations and interactions. Storyline ships with templates   that you can leverage to kick start the development of your e-learning projects.  Storyline templates have the file extension of .storytemplate and are located in  My Documents  My Articulate Projects  Storyline Templates on your local hard  drive. This folder will also contain any templates you download or create yourself. Two templates ship with Storyline: Character Panels and Top Interactions.  [ 15 ]   Creating a Story  There are two ways to create a story from a template:     Choose From project template from the Storyline launch screen or    double-click on a .storytemplate file in Windows Explorer to open   a new story based on the template chosen.  From the Insert tab, choose New Slide  Templates to add new content  based on a template into an existing story and then follow these steps to  insert the template's content into a story:  1.  From the Template drop-down menu, select a template. 2.  One or more slides will appear. Click to select a slide template   or hold down the Ctrl key and click to select more than one slide  template. You can also use Ctrl + A to select all slide templates.  3.  From the Insert into scene drop-down menu, choose how    you would like the slides to be inserted into the existing story.   There are three choices:    Current scene: Places new slides directly after the current slide     Same as imported template: Inserts the slides into the current  story in the same way they were originally named and organized.     New scene: Places the new slides into a scene of their own  [ 16 ]   4.  Click on Import.  Chapter 1  After creating a story from a template or inserting slides based on a template into an  existing story, the template used will be added into your template library and will  appear in the Templates drop-down menu the next time you use the menu. Templates are located in My Documents  My Articulate Projects  Storyline  Templates. You can rename templates, copy templates into this folder, or delete  templates that you no longer use, just like you would with any Windows folder.  Changes made here will be reflected in the Templates drop-down menu.  File Open versus From project template If you choose File  Open to open a template, Storyline will open  the template and you can make changes to the content, formatting,  and interactions within the template. If you save the template, you  will be overwriting the original template. If you would rather create  a new story or new content from a template  as opposed to editing  the formatting and functionality of a template  choose one of the two  preceding methods instead.  [ 17 ]   Creating a Story  Importing content from external sources Storyline offers features that help you leverage work you've already done in  PowerPoint, Articulate Studio '09, and even other Storyline files. Although Storyline  does a very good job at accurately transitioning content from other sources, there  are variances. The variances are largely related to different formatting and feature  support between the products.  There are two main methods of importing content; from the launch menu at start-up  or from within an open project:     Choose Import PowerPoint or Import Quizmaker from the Storyline    launch screen.     From within an open project, select the Articulate menu and choose Import.   There are more import options available here including Engage and Storyline.  Importing PowerPoint content Importing PowerPoint content is a great time saver. You won't need to recreate your  content from scratch. Articulate does not support importing from the 64-bit version  of PowerPoint 2010. You will also want to ensure your version of Office has the latest  updates applied.  PowerPoint and Articulate Presenter features are not 100 percent converted  into Storyline using the Import feature. For example, annotations, branching,  attachments, presenter bios, learning games, and player template settings are not  imported  a complete and current list of considerations when importing from  PowerPoint can be found on the Articulate support website at http:  www. articulate.com support kb_article.php?product=st1&id=catmp4tjk9r8 .  Most of these features can be manually recreated after importing. It's recommended  you look at the PowerPoint Import option as a way to bring content into Storyline  more than a functionality of PowerPoint or Presenter into Storyline.  The content conversion isn't quite one to one. There are some differences you can  expect as noted here:     Some variations in font size, line spacing, alignment, colors, and bullets    Storyline doesn't support embedded PowerPoint fonts  If the PowerPoint presentation is of a different size to the Storyline   size, some adjustments will be needed to be made in graphic and text   size and alignment         Entrance and exit animations along with emphasis and motion paths    are not supported in Storyline  [ 18 ]      Border and line thickness may appear different in Storyline    3D rotations and GIF images aren't supported in Storyline    Smart Art objects, tables, and equations are imported as non-editable images  Even with features that are not 100 percent supported, you may find it faster to  import content in, rather than manually replacing or manually recreating the content.  Chapter 1  When importing Articulate Presenter content into  Storyline, you will need to make sure that the .ppta file  as well as any embedded Quizmaker  .quiz  and Engage   .intr  interactions are all located in the same folder.  Selecting slides After selecting a PowerPoint file, Storyline will display thumbnail images for all  slides in the presentation. By default, all slides are selected, as indicated by a yellow  border around each selected slide. You can change this by clicking on and selecting  just one slide, or by using Shift + click or Alt + click, or you can select all slides again  using Ctrl + A. The imported content will appear in the current scene or a new scene  depending on your Insert into scene selection.  [ 19 ]   Creating a Story  Once done, slides will appear in Storyline and you can freely edit the objects on the  slides and apply formatting and functionality to them.  Importing Articulate Quizmaker content Importing a Quizmaker file is straightforward and works well. Storyline maintains  most of the original formatting and functionality, making it a snap to rapidly  incorporate existing quizzes into your Storyline projects.  One consideration is that Quizmaker has a default slide size of 686 px x 424 px  whereas Storyline defaults at 720 px x 540 px. For that reason, you can expect   some minor formatting to tweak the alignment of text and graphics.  Articulate Quizmaker files have an extension of .quiz. After selecting a .quiz file to  import, Storyline will display thumbnail images for all the slides in that quiz, divided  into sections based upon the question groups they are in. As with other methods of  importing, you can select one, a few, or all of the slides to import into Storyline.  Once done, the questions, feedback, and results are 100 percent editable in Storyline.  [ 20 ]   Chapter 1  Importing Articulate Engage content Unlike importing PowerPoint slides and Quizmaker files, Engage content cannot be  modified within Storyline except for resizing the interaction on the slide. In order to  modify Engage content, you must be working in Articulate Engage.  Importing Engage interactions provides the ability to playback previously created  interactions without having to rebuild them in Storyline. However, you may want to  rebuild them, as Storyline contains all of the features of Engage plus some that take  interactions to the next level in terms of look, feel, and functionality. Another reason  to rebuild them is that they are Flash interactions and Flash does not playback on  most mobile devices or the iPad.  The steps to import an Engage interaction are the same as with PowerPoint   and Quizmaker.  Importing Storyline content This sounds unusual but it's a really neat feature of Storyline. Being able to import  Storyline files lets you combine content in a smart way; you can pick and choose  specific slides from certain project files to import. The look, feel, and functionality   are imported. This is a great feature for re-usability where you create a library of  your own interactions and layouts, then re-use them inside many different projects.  Saving a story It won't take long to start to accumulate content in your story, especially when  working with pre-built templates or importing content from external sources. It's a  good idea to save your work often and it is recommended that Articulate files are  saved locally instead of on network drives or USB sticks, to prevent file errors.  There are three ways in which you can save your story:     The quickest way to save your work is to press Ctrl + S on your keyboard. If  this is the first time you are saving a file, you will be prompted for a filename  and location. Subsequent presses of Ctrl + S will save the file under the same  name without additional prompts.  [ 21 ]   Creating a Story  access tool bar.     You can also save a project by clicking on the Save button on the quick       You can choose the File menu and select Save or Save As….  Storyline files are saved with a .story extension.  Shortcuts Shortcut keys are a time saver. A complete listing of shortcut  keys, such as Ctrl + S to save a story are listed in the Appendix.  Give it a try Now it's your turn. This exercise gives you a chance to practice some of the key  points covered in this chapter. You'll continue to build upon this example file   as you progress through the book.  1.   If you've been following along with the practices in this chapter you'll likely  have a blank story file already open. Close this file by clicking on the File  menu in the upper-left corner and selecting Close. When prompted to   save, choose Don't Save. From the Storyline launch screen, choose From  project template.  2.  Navigate to My Documents  My Articulate Projects  Storyline Templates. 3.  Select Character Panels.storytemplate and click Open.  [ 22 ]   4.  Various character templates appear. Look for the one titled Folder,    select it, and click on the Import button.  Chapter 1  5.  After the template opens, notice there is a single scene with a single    slide. Both should be renamed to be more descriptive. Follow these steps:  1.  Right-click on the scene  grey boundary around the slide  and    select Rename. Type the new name as Starting Sequence.  [ 23 ]   Creating a Story  2.  Right-click on the slide, select Rename, and type the new name    as Home.  6.  Click on the Fit to Window button to the right of the zoom slider in the  lower-right corner of the scene. This will enlarge the Story View display   to make content on the slide viewable.  7.  Double-click on the slide to switch to Normal View. 8.  Change the aspect ratio of the project to widescreen by choosing the Design   tab and then Story Size. Change the size to 720 px x 405 px  16:9 . Choose  Scale to fit and click OK.  9.  Save the story by pressing Ctrl + S, typing Exercise 1 – Workplace   Compliance in the filename box and clicking on the Save button.  Summary This chapter introduced some of the basics of the Storyline interface, including two  new concepts for PowerPoint and Articulate Presenter users: Story View and scenes.  Story View is a powerful new way of looking at your project content. You can see  how slides are grouped into scenes, and the navigational relationships between  slides and scenes.  With these basics in hand, including configuring story size, working with templates,  and importing content from external sources, you're now ready to add text and  images into your story and make it sparkle and shine using Storyline formatting and  animation techniques.  [ 24 ]   Adding Content into   your Story  When you begin a new project in Storyline, you are presented with a single scene  and a single blank slide within the scene. Think of this as a blank canvas; one that  you design and configure in any way you see fit to create an awesome learning  experience for those taking your course.  That said, not everything you create will need to be a one-off original that begins  with a blank canvas; there are always constraints of time and budget that limit   how far you can take things. Storyline's built-in templates, while not the focus   of this chapter, will be leveraged in the exercises in this chapter, to quickly add  content to your story so that you can focus your effort on customizing rather   than creating from scratch.  In this chapter you will learn:     How to work with the Timeline    How to insert and format slide content    More about working with slides and Story View    To control the design of your story through master slides, backgrounds,   colors, and fonts     How to animate objects on a slide and animate transitions between slides    To use the Preview function to see how your slides look and function   Adding Content into your Story  Working with the Timeline The Timeline lists all of the objects, or content, that is present on a slide and is used  to arrange and animate objects as well as control slide duration. The Timeline tab appears in the Timeline, States and Notes panel directly below the  slide when in Normal View as shown below:  If you can't see the Timeline, then perform the following steps:  1.  Click on the small arrow in the lower-right corner of the slide stage to display   the Timeline, States, and Notes panel.  2.  Click on the Timeline tab to display the Timeline.  The Exercise 1 – Workplace Compliance file, created in Chapter 1, Creating a  Story, contains a combination of text, graphics, and placeholder content. A listing   of the slide objects appears in the Timeline, as shown in the previous image.  [ 26 ]   Chapter 2  Here are a few things you should know when working with the Timeline:     You can turn the visibility of objects on or off. You may find yourself   doing this when objects are positioned in similar locations on the slide   and you want to edit an object that appears beneath another. Temporarily  turning the visibility of the top object off lets you clearly see the bottom  object. You'll need to remember to turn visibility back on as objects that   are not visible also do not appear in your final, published course.     You can rename objects and should get into the habit of doing this. Creating   short, meaningful names will help you clearly identify what the object is. In the  next screenshot, renaming the first Placeholder object to be Intro Text makes it  more obvious what kind of object it is and what it contains.     You can also lock objects. This is a handy feature to prevent accidental   movement or formatting of objects that you do not want to change:  [ 27 ]   Adding Content into your Story  Controlling the appearance of objects The order of objects is important. Storyline overlaps slide objects so that the object   at the top of the list in the Timeline is in front of all other slide objects.  You can move objects to a different stacking order by clicking on the object directly  in the timeline and dragging it up  bring forward  or down  send backward .   You can also right-click on an object on the slide and choose the action you   want to perform:  Follow along… With the Exercise 1 – Workplace Compliance file open, try turning the display  on and off for a few objects and note how the slide content changes. Try moving  Character 1 below Group 1. Notice that it disappears since it's now beneath the  image of the folder. Move Character 1 back up such that it is above page 1.  Reading the Timeline The Timeline can be read vertically for stacking order and horizontally for timing.  The numbers running horizontally along the top show the running time of a slide in  seconds. In the example above, all slide objects are visible when the slide starts and  each stays visible until the end of the slide, in this case 4 seconds.  [ 28 ]   Chapter 2  You can quickly preview a slide by clicking on the Play button  in the lower-left corner of the Timeline. If you want to playback  from a specific point, drag-and-drop the red icon  playhead  that  appears on the upper-left side of the Timeline to the point in the  Timeline where you would like to start playback, and then click  on Play. You can also Stop playback and use zoom controls to  control the Timeline display. Note that during slide play back,   you will not be able to interact with any of the objects.  Follow along… Continuing with the Exercise 1 – Workplace Compliance file, let's now add  some text and adjust object names and timing:  1.  From the Design tab in the ribbon, select Story Size and adjust the size back   to a 4:3 ratio by choosing 720 x 540  4:3  from the story size drop-down list.  2.  Switch to Normal View, click in the title area where it says Click to add title,  and type the new title as Introduction to Comstar Compliance Program. It's a good habit to rename objects on a slide to something descriptive as   you go along. In the Timeline, double-click on object names and rename   as follows:  3.      Textbox : title Placeholder : introduction       Picture 1 : paper clip    Character 1 : employee    Page 1 : intro paper    Paper 1 : paper    Group 1 : folder  [ 29 ]   Adding Content into your Story  4.  Use your mouse to click-and-drag each object so that the timing of the object   when it appears on the slide looks like the following:  5.  Click on the Play button to play the Timeline. 6.  Save this file under a new name, Exercise 2 – Workplace Compliance.  Inserting content into a slide Inserting shapes, text, and other objects onto a slide is similar to when using  Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint. For example, to add a rectangle shape   to a slide, select the Insert tab and click on the Shape option to choose a rectangle  shape, and click-and-drag the slide to insert, position, and size the rectangle.  [ 30 ]   Once you have objects, images, text, or other content on a slide, you can format them  in a familiar way as you would with Microsoft Office products:  Chapter 2  You also use familiar mouse gestures when working with slide objects:  Here are some common adjustments you might make to a Storyline shape:     Change Shape: This is handy if you'd like to change an object to another   shape, for example, a textbox that is a box into a circle.     Quick Styles: This is an easy way to change the fill color, font, outline, and   effect of a shape. The color choices depend on the current design theme   design themes are covered in more detail later in this chapter .  [ 31 ]   Adding Content into your Story     Shape Fill, Outline, and Effects: You can fill a shape with a solid or semi- transparent fill color, picture, gradient, or texture. You can also add a line  around a textbox of various colors, widths, and styles.     Shape Effects: This can add shadows, reflections, glows, and soft edges.  The Format Painter is a handy feature found on the Home  tab, making it easy to apply formatting from one object to  another. Select the object whose format you wish to apply,  click on Format Painter and then click on the object to  format. You can also double-click on the Format Painter to  apply formatting to multiple objects.  Grouping objects You can group objects together to help with slide organization. For example,   if five objects make up the image of a folder, you can group those objects together  and name the group as "file folder". In that way all objects related to the folder are  kept together.  To group objects, select all of the objects to be grouped by drawing an outline around  them on the slide or shift-clicking to select multiple objects. Then press Ctrl + G or  right-click and select Group.  You can quickly select all objects on a slide by pressing Ctrl + A.  Follow along… Let's turn back to Exercise 2 – Workplace Compliance, this time the focus will   be on editing and adding objects to the slide:  1.  Click on the text placeholder, where it says Click to add text. Type =lorem    and then press Enter. This is a quick way to insert sample text into a textbox.  [ 32 ]   2.  Resize the employee image to make it large and then, while the image is  selected, click on the green handle above the image to rotate it so that the  image appears straight. Now let's move it so that it looks similar to the  following screenshot:  Chapter 2  3.  Refine the look of the employee image by adding an Offset Diagonal Bottom   Left shadow to it.  Insert a textbox below the employee image and type Compliance Matters!  4.  Select the employee and the paper clip and group them by pressing Ctrl + G. 5.  Rename this group from Group 1 in the Timeline to employee. 6.  7.  Rename this textbox from Text Box 1 to be compliance matters. 8.  Adjust the width of the box to go from edge to edge of the visible portion   of the folder image changing the font to Articulate Extrabold, the size to   18pt and alignment to be centered. Insert a rectangle shape and draw it so it goes across the white part of the  slide and make it tall enough to cover the words Compliance Matters!  9.   10.  Right-click on the rectangle, choose Format Shape and change the    following attributes:     Change the Shape Fill to black.       Change the slide Transparency to 60 percent. Click on Close    Turn the Shape Outline off by selecting No Outline.  when done.  [ 33 ]   Adding Content into your Story  11.  Rename Rectangle 1 to be compliance box. 12.  Move the compliance box so that it is centered over the words    Compliance Matters!  For precise alignment, select the words Compliance Matters! and  for the rectangle navigate to Align  Middle from the Format tab.  13.  Select the words Compliance Matters! then change the font to a lighter color. 14.  Move the words Compliance Matters! above the compliance box in    the Timeline.  15.  Select compliance matters and compliance box then group them. 16.  Rename the new group titled Group 1 to be subtitle. 17.  Move the subtitle group below intro paper in the Timeline. 18.  Move the subtitle group to begin at the 2.5 seconds mark in the Timeline. 19.  Save the file:  Working with text By now you've seen that inserting, sizing, and formatting text objects in Storyline  is similar to with PowerPoint and other Microsoft Office products. There are two  features in Storyline that provide additional functionality to text in your story:  [ 34 ]   Chapter 2  Scrolling panels A scrolling panel lets you place a large volume of text  or just about any other object   that would normally consume a lot of space on a slide, into a contained area. If the text  overflows, the learner will be able to scroll vertically and horizontally to see all of the  information. You can have as many scrolling panels on a single slide as you like. To create a scrolling panel, choose the Insert tab from the ribbon and then select  Scrolling Panel.  Slide notes If you've used Articulate Presenter you will be familiar with slide notes. Storyline  handles this the same way, allowing you to add notes to each slide. Notes can be  viewed in the published story as transcripts, narration captions, or instructions. To add slide notes, click on the Notes tab in the Timeline, States, and Notes panel.  You can format notes using most of the text and paragraph formatting options  including fonts, bullets, and alignment.  The following screenshot provides examples of scrolling panels and slide notes:  [ 35 ]   Adding Content into your Story  Working with pictures and screenshots You can insert a picture from your computer or a screenshot using Storyline's built- in screenshot tool.  Storyline does not have a clipart feature like PowerPoint.   To work with Microsoft clipart, download the images needed  from http:  office.microsoft.com en-us images   and insert them into Storyline.  Inserting a screenshot Storyline's screenshot tool lets you capture images from other applications that are  running on your computer or any portion of the screen.  Here's how to add screenshots:  1.  While viewing a slide, click on the Insert tab and choose Screenshot. 2.  A drop-down list appears displaying all open applications or windows on   your computer. Minimized applications or windows will not appear on the list.  3.  Move the mouse over any thumbnail in the list to see the application   or window name and click to insert a screenshot of that item into the   current slide.  4.  To take a screenshot of just a portion of the screen, choose Screen Clipping  instead. Storyline will temporarily disappear to allow you to click-and-drag  the mouse to select the area of the screen to be clipped. The selected area   will not be dim. Just release the mouse to insert the screenshot into   the current slide.  Adjusting the properties of pictures and  screenshots Similar to adjusting the way a textbox or shape appears, you can apply graphic  treatments to images. These are similar to the options in PowerPoint, though not  quite as many:  [ 36 ]   Chapter 2  It's fairly common practice to edit your images in a tool other than Storyline,  however, if you don't have another image editing tool or just need to make   a few minor adjustments, here are some things you can do:     Touch up a picture by adjusting brightness, contrast, and color.    Add a cool picture style. This is an easy way to alter the look of an    image without any fuss.     Change the shape of a picture to create interesting effects.    Add a border.     Jazz up a picture by adding shadows, reflections, glows, and soft edges.  You can let learners zoom up an image, which is particularly useful  for more complex graphics, flowcharts, and diagrams. You can do  this by selecting the image, and choosing Format  Zoom Picture.  [ 37 ]   Adding Content into your Story Visual help When working with objects on a slide, like a textbox or other shape, it's a good  practice to turn on visual guidance to assist with positioning and alignment.   There are three tools available that can be toggled on or off by right-clicking   on the outside area of the slide or from the View tab in the ribbon:     Ruler: This displays vertical and horizontal rulers in the slide stage area.    Guidelines: This displays rows and columns of dotted lines, each eight pixels   wide, creating a grid. This can be adjusted by expanding the Show option.     Guides: This is a vertical and horizontal guide which appears initially in the  center of the slide, however, you can use the mouse to click-and-drag these  guides into position and Ctrl + click to create new ones.  By default, when you move an object around a slide it will align  itself to the nearest gridline even if gridlines aren't turned on. While  this is usually helpful, it can occasionally interfere with the precise  alignment of objects. You may opt to temporarily turn this feature  off. You can do this from the View tab, expanding the Show option   under Ruler, Gridlines, and Guides  and turning off the checkmark  beside Snap objects to grid.  [ 38 ]   Chapter 2  Working with slides It's easy to expand content in your story by inserting new slides. You can do this  from the Insert tab by selecting Insert Slide. There will be several options; in each case click on the thumbnail image in the  template, basic layouts, quizzing, screen recordings, or import to insert a slide   into the project.  You have control over how this is inserted; into the current location in the current  scene, in the same way as how it is set up in the template  it can be a single slide   or a slide within a scene  or as a slide in a new scene in the existing project. Here's a brief description of each Insert New Slide options:     Templates: These are a great way to leverage and reuse content.    There are templates that come pre-packaged with Storyline, templates   that can be downloaded from the Articulate community, or templates   that you've created.     Basic Layouts: These show options that are available based on existing Slide  Masters and slide layouts within the project that's currently open. Storyline  comes with default layouts that you can customize or you can create your  own new layouts.     Quizzing: This lets you insert a graded question, a survey question, or one    of the several freeform-style interactions.     Screen Recordings: These let you insert a simple movie of your screen that  shows learners how to perform a task or an interactive video that learners  can interact with to try or test their knowledge. Import: This is used to bring in content from an existing PowerPoint file,  an Articulate Quizmaker quiz, an Articulate Engage interaction, or another  Storyline project as covered in Chapter 1, Creating a Story.      If you have a slide that has objects and formatting you'd like  to use elsewhere in your story, you can duplicate the slide by  selecting the slide and pressing Ctrl + D to duplicate or you can  also use copy and paste to achieve the same.  [ 39 ]   Adding Content into your Story  Organizing slides in Story View Once there are a few slides in your story, you can switch to Story View by clicking on  the Story View tab or choosing the View tab then selecting Story View. Scenes and slides are automatically numbered in Story View. This numbering system  is dynamic and will update depending on where a slide or scene is positioned. Slide  numbering and scene numbering does not affect when navigational structure. From Story View you can see a bigger picture of all the slides in the story and can  begin to organize and arrange the slides within a scene, or create multiple scenes to  group related slides together similar to how you group multiple objects on a slide:  To move slides within a scene in Story View:  1.  Click on the slide you wish to move  a yellow box will appear around the   2.  Click-and-drag the slide into the position in the scene where you would like   selected slide .  it to appear.  [ 40 ]   Chapter 2  To create a new scene in Story View, click on the Home tab then select New Scene. To expand and collapse scenes, click on the minus or plus icon on the right-hand   side of the scene to expand or collapse a scene.  Here is how we set the starting scene: The starting scene in Storyline is the scene that begins an e-learning project; the very  first thing the learner sees. The starting scene is indicated in Story View by a green  flag. You can control which scene is the starting scene by right-clicking on the scene  and by choosing Starting Scene.  Follow along… Let's continue with Exercise 2 – Workplace Compliance, this time the focus  will be on expanding the course, organizing slides, and customizing content. The  first step in the process is to add new slides into the story to expand each of the  compliance topics. You will work with a prebuilt Articulate template to do this    note that you will need to sign up for a free Articulate community forums   account to download the template :  1.  Select the Insert tab and choose New Slide. 2.  Click on the Templates tab and click on the down arrow in the Template   drop-down list to view the existing templates you have installed.

Images and objects that extend beyond the slide are not visible when  previewing or publishing, such as the paper images on this slide. You  could take the extra step of cropping to fit the image within the slide  area to prevent the screen from shifting up and down when editing.  [ 45 ]   Adding Content into your Story  3.  Replace the text underneath the title to =lorem   removing the last   paragraph as this goes off slide and is not needed:  15.  Switch to Story View to see how the flow of the course is shaping up. Switch   back to Normal View when done and save the file.  Customizing slide design Storyline offers several features to help you customize the design of your   project. Templates such as the Desktop Overhead come with specific colors,   fonts, backgrounds, and slide layouts. All of these components can be edited   to enable you to create your own unique variation or you can create your own  original template from scratch.  Here are three features useful for customizing slide design:  Slide Masters Storyline Slide Masters function the same way as they do in PowerPoint and they  can save a lot of time by eliminating unnecessary duplication of effort. The idea of a  Slide Master is that you can design and build content and activities you know will  be used for multiple slides and you do this just once in the Slide Master. You then  apply that master layout to one or more slides in the story. When a change is needed,  instead of editing multiple slides, all you need to do is edit once in the master slide  and let Storyline apply this to all slides that are using that master layout.  [ 46 ]   There can be one or more Slide Masters containing a number of slide layouts for a  single course. Each layout can be edited using all the regular formatting commands. Slide Masters can be accessed by clicking on the View tab and selecting Slide Master:  Chapter 2  Slide Masters can consist of placeholder content. A placeholder can be set   up to accept text, pictures, illustrated characters, movies, Flash, or web objects.  Placeholders can be formatted and positioned using all the standard formatting  functions. When a slide is using a master layout that contains a placeholder, a   dotted border will appear prompting you to enter text, insert an image, and so on.  Here's how to access and work with Slide Masters:  1.  From the View tab, choose Slide Master. 2.  Format the master slide and layouts as you normally would for a slide. 3.  Add a placeholder by clicking on the Slide Master tab and selecting Insert   Placeholder. Select the type of placeholder and then use your mouse to  draw and position the placeholder on the slide. You can resize and move the  placeholder into position and apply formatting to it using the Format tab.  4.  Return to Normal View and then right-click on a slide to which you would  like to apply a master layout. To do this, choose Layout from the menu and  select the appropriate layout.  [ 47 ]   Adding Content into your Story  Design themes and backgrounds Storyline design themes and backgrounds function like they do in PowerPoint.  Design themes specify colors and fonts that can be applied to one or more slides   and include several built-in themes. You can choose to use the theme as it is or you  can alter it to suit your needs by adjusting fonts, colors, and background styles. Design themes, backgrounds, colors, and fonts can be accessed from the Design tab  and can be applied to a single slide, multiple slides, or all slides.  Clicking the down arrow to the right of the Theme list expands the  list and displays options to browse and save themes. You can browse  for Storyline theme files  files ending in .theme  that are not located  in the default Storyline themes directory. This is useful if you share  themes with others on a network or want to import a theme built by  someone else. You can also save a theme under a new name if you  altered the theme fonts, colors, or backgrounds and wish to keep the  original intact. The new theme will appear in the Theme list so that it  can be used in any Storyline project.  [ 48 ]   Chapter 2  Follow along… Working with Exercise 2 – Workplace Compliance, perform the following steps  to apply the theme and master formatting of your sample course:  1.  Select the first slide, 1.1 Home. 2.  Click on Slide Master and right-click on the second Slide Master  a number 2   appears next to it  and rename it as Desktop.  3.  Hover over the fourth layout in this Slide Master. The name of the layout   should display as Custom Layout. Click on it to select this layout.  4.  Change the font for the title placeholder to be white and make this bold. 5.  Exit the Slide Master, right-click on the first slide, choose Layout from the   menu, and select Custom Layout from Slide Master 2.  6.  Adjust the wording Compliance Matters! such that it's split over two lines   and the font color is white.  7.  Save the file.  Adding animations and transitions Storyline includes entrance and exit animations that are a subset of what is available  in PowerPoint. Animations are easy to add to any object on a slide and are useful for  creating emphasis and subtle motion to slide content. This is particularly true when  used in combination with Slide Transitions that animate the transition from one  slide to another using a variety of video-like effects.  [ 49 ]   Adding Content into your Story  Animations are fun but practice restraint when it comes to using  animations in your e-learning courses. With fonts, colors, and sounds,   a little goes a long way. You'll want to use these animations strategically  and sparingly for greatest professional emphasis and effect.  Slide Transitions can be accessed from the Animations tab in Normal and Master  Slide Views. Animations cannot be accessed from Story View.  Here's how to add an animation to an object on a slide:  1.  Select the object you wish to animate. 2.  Click on the Animation tab. 3.  Choose an Entrance Effect  there are 5 different effects to choose from . 4.  Choose a Speed  Storyline defaults at Medium but this can be adjusted . 5.  Choose a direction the animation should Enter From. By default the  animation appears from the current location but you can change this   to animate in from one of eight specific directions.  6.  You can repeat this process for the Exit Animation if you want the object    to disappear off the slide in an animated fashion.  7.  You can further refine when and how long an object appears on the slide   using the Timeline to adjust the start and the end duration of an object.  Remember that you cannot see if animations have been applied to  an object from the Timeline. You will need to select the object, and  then the Animation menu to view animation effects. You can play  the Timeline to quickly see an effect by clicking on the Play button  in the lower-left corner of the timeline. You can also Preview the  slide which will be covered in the next topic.  Here's how to apply a transition to a slide:  1.   In Story View or Normal View, select the slide to which you want to apply a  transition effect  you can only set entrance effects for slide transitions .  2.  Click on the Animation tab. 3.  Choose from one of the available Transitions listed in the ribbon or click    on the down arrow to expand the effects list.  4.  Choose a Speed for the transition.  [ 50 ]   5.  Click on the Apply to All button if you wish to apply this transition    effect to all slides.  6.  Repeat the process for each slide where you want to apply a transition.  Chapter 2  You can apply animations and transitions to slide layouts and  objects in layouts from the Slide Master. This can help create  consistency of effects in your course.  Previewing your work Once there are a few slides in place, you may wish to take a quick look at how things  are shaping up. You can preview the current slide the current scene of or the entire  story  shortcut key is F12  by clicking on the Preview button from the Home tab. Previewing not only shows the slide content but also shows the default navigation  including next and back buttons and the menu. Though the buttons and options are  there, some may not work if you are previewing a single slide. For example, the next  button will not display the next slide. This would only happen if you are previewing  a scene or the entire project. Preview shows the Player interface surrounding the slide content. This can   be customized by changing colors, fonts, and options such as menu visibility,  location, and volume control. Customizing the Player is covered in Chapter 10,  Publishing your Story  [ 51 ]   Adding Content into your Story Follow along… This last exercise will finalize our first draft of Exercise 2 – Workplace  Compliance. Perform the following steps to add animations and transitions   to the course:  1.  Navigate to the first slide and expand the Timeline to see all objects. 2.  Add the following animations:  1.  Add a Fade In entrance animation to the folder group. 2.  Add a Fly In entrance animation, and select the Fast speed    from the Bottom to the intro paper.  3.  Add a Fade In By First Level Paragraph option from the Top   entrance animation to the introduction.  4.  Add a Grow In entrance animation to the employee group. 5.  Click on the triangle besides the subtitle group in the Timeline to   expand it. Click on compliance box then add a Fade In from the  Left entrance animation and Fade Out to the Right exit animation.  3.  Preview this slide. You can click on Replay to watch again. Click on    Close Preview.  4.  Select the 1.2 Menu slide. 5.  Adjust the color of the post-it notes and practice using Format Painter    by following these steps:  1.  2.    Select the first note, right-click on it and choose Format Shape.  In the Fill section, click on the Color drop-down list and choose  More Colors.  3.  Drag the color slider on the right-hand side of the screen higher to  make the yellow a fainter color or enter 255 for Red, 255 for Green,  and 110 for Blue in the respective boxes and click on OK, then Close. 4.  While the first note is still selected, click on the Home Tab and select   Format Painter  or click the paintbrush icon . Click on the second  note to apply the formatting. Repeat this for the third note.  6.  While still on the 1.2 Menu slide, click on the Animations tab and assign    the Cover Up Slide Transition to this slide.  7.  Select the last three slides and assign the Slide Transition of Fade Out. 8.  Preview and view each slide by pressing the Next button in the lower-right   corner of the slide. Make sure that you see the scrolling textbox and zoom  screenshot on the Privacy slide and navigate using the menu on the left.  When done, close Preview.  [ 52 ]   Chapter 2  9.  Separate each of the topic areas into a scene on its own. This helps to keep the   topic areas organized, particularly as more slides are created:  1.  Switch to Story View and click on New Scene from the Home tab. 2.  Rename the new scene as Business Conduct. 3.  Repeat the steps above for Privacy and Security. 4.  Click-and-drag the 1.3 Business Conduct slide into the new Business   Conduct scene. Repeat this for each of the other two topics.  5.  Delete each of the blank slides in each new scene. The story should   now look like the following screenshot. Be sure to save the file.  You may want to practice with Story View. Now that your file has been saved, just  be sure not to save it again, simply close the file and do not save the changes when  you're done.  Storyline assumes your course content will flow in linear fashion, from one slide to  the next, as shown by the arrows between slides. Storyline automatically numbers  slides and scenes sequentially. If you want the Home slide to come after the Menu  slide, all you need to do is to click on the Menu slide and drag it up. A blue arrow  will appear indicating where the slide will be placed. Once you release the mouse,  you'll notice that the slides are automatically renumbered to reflect the move.  You can manipulate the view in Story View by clicking on the small minus icons   to collapse and plus icons to expand scenes and using the zoom controls in the  lower-right corner.  [ 53 ]   Adding Content into your Story  Summary This chapter covered the basic formatting tasks and expanded our course with   new slides and scenes. If you have used PowerPoint in the past, you may have  noticed how similar Storyline is; a lot of its basic features work just like they do   in Microsoft Office.  It's always good practice to save your work often. With Storyline you can also  preview your work frequently to make sure that animations, object placement,   and formatting styles look and behave the way you expect. The Preview function  in Storyline is speedy and it's an amazing timesaver; checking as you go makes for  fewer changes at the end.  You're already discovering how much you can do in Storyline without being a  designer or developer. It takes a lot less effort to make an e-learning course look  good and even less to make it interactive. Just remember to keep your work simple  and focus on how to use the tool to best educate those who will be taking your  courses. In the next chapter we'll explore how to add interactivity to a story.  [ 54 ]   Adding Interactivity  Storyline has two powerful features at the core of its authoring environment:   states and triggers. States can change the way an object appears and triggers can   add action to your story. The combination of these two features creates an endless  variety of interactions. Interactivity is really all about action. Rarely is something interactive without   a resulting action. An example would be clicking or touching a button that displays  the next slide. In Storyline, the button is the object, the click touch of the button is  the event and moving to the next slide is the action. But action can also occur based  on a condition rather than user input. For example, a slide  object  can automatically  advance to the next slide  action  when the timeline ends  event .  States change the appearance of an object. For example, when a button is clicked or  touched, it changes color from green to red. The change of color is a change of state  from the default green  normal  to red  selected . State changes occur based on some  kind of action: whether caused by user input or by a condition.  This chapter covers the basics of adding action to a story; both user interaction   and conditional actions in addition to controlling object appearance and behavior.  In this chapter you will learn:     More about states and triggers    How to add hyperlinks and buttons to a slide's content    Additional formatting tips to add finesse to your example story    How to quickly publish to validate functionality   Adding Interactivity  Follow along… The exercise at the end of Chapter 2, Adding Content into your Story, created a   file called Exercise 2 – Workplace Compliance. This file should be open   in Storyline before continuing.  Working with states States alter the appearance of objects and are a great way of providing visual   cues and feedback to learners. You could use states to:  Indicate course progress when a topic is complete        Add a glow to a button or image when hovered over    Pop up a definition when the mouse rolls over a word  States can be applied to any object on a slide including images, shapes, text boxes,  and captions. By default, an object has just one state called normal and this is what  you see before any event happens that may trigger a change of state to the object.  There are eight built-in states. Built-in states are triggered automatically and don't  require additional setup for them to function. For example, the state called hover will  automatically be triggered when the user hovers the mouse over an object that has a  hover state assigned to it.  [ 56 ]   Chapter 3  You can also create your own custom states. Custom states are given  a unique name by you and are triggered manually. Custom states  are often used when user input, such as a mouse click, isn't needed.  Usually a condition of some form triggers the state change.  You can change the appearance of any state using all the standard formatting  commands including font, color, effects, size, alignment, and so on. Not only   can each state have different formatting, but each state can also have additional  objects associated with it, including sounds and animations.  To create and manage states, you will need to use the States tab located in the  Timeline, States, and Notes panel as shown in the screen shots here.  [ 57 ]   Adding Interactivity  Here's how to create a state:  1.  Click on the object to which you would like to add a state. 2.  Click on the States tab. 3.  Click on Edit States and then click on the New State icon that appears    to the right of the Done Editing States button.  4.  Select a new state using any of the built-in state names as displayed in the   drop-down list, or type a new state name.  5.  Click on Add. The new state appears in the list of available states for the   object that you selected.  6.  To create another new state, you can click on Add again or select one    of the existing available states by clicking on the state  a yellow highlight   will appear around the selected state . Click on the Duplicate icon to create   a copy with the same formatting.  7.  When finished editing, click on the Done Editing States button to save    your changes.  By default, other objects on the slide dim when you're creating or  editing states. You can uncheck the Dim checkbox from the States  panel to display all objects on the slide normally.  Here's how to edit a state:  1.  Click on the object that you would like to add a state to. 2.  Click on the States tab. 3.  Click on Edit States. At this point, you can select any of the states listed and   perform the following tasks:     Delete the state by clicking on the Delete icon.    Reset the state back to the normal state by clicking on the Reset icon.    Use any of the standard object formatting features to adjust the look  and feel of the object. For example, you can add a glow to an object's  hover state by clicking on the Format tab, selecting Shape Effects,  and applying a glow to the object. The glow effect will only be  displayed when the user hovers the mouse over the object.  4.  After you finish editing, click on the Done Editing States button to save    your changes.  [ 58 ]   Chapter 3  To save time, you can use the Editing states on the drop-down list on  the right side of the States panel to edit objects that are on the same slide.  When you scroll over items in the list, an outline is displayed to highlight  the currently selected object. Make any changes necessary to the object.  Changes to all objects are saved when you click on the Done Editing  States button. You can use Format Painter on the Home tab to quickly apply the  formatting of the selected object, including its states, to another.  By default, the initial state is always Normal, but when an object has more than  one state, you can specify an initial state other than Normal. You can even specify  Hidden as the initial state, which means the object won't appear until triggered.  Working with triggers Triggers are used whenever you need to create action. Triggers can be used to do  things such as:  Jump from slide to slide        Open a web page    Submit a quiz    Play a sound or video clip  Triggers are displayed in the Triggers panel and organized into three groups: slide  triggers  timeline start or end , object triggers  state or interaction with an object ,   and player triggers  player buttons next, back, and submit .   [ 59 ]   Adding Interactivity  The order of triggers is very important since triggers are processed sequentially in  order of appearance from top to bottom. Having triggers in the wrong order will  produce unexpected results. For example, if you want to change the state of an image  before advancing to the next slide, the image state trigger must appear before the  slide advance trigger in the Triggers panel.  Triggers can be applied to any type of object and are activated by an event of some  form. There are 14 different types of events that can activate a trigger, which can be  seen on the left-hand side of the following screenshot.  [ 60 ]   Once activated, there are 21 different kinds of actions that can result; those are listed  on the right-hand side of the following screenshot:  Chapter 3  [ 61 ]   Adding Interactivity  To create a trigger, perform the following steps:  1.  Click on the Create new trigger icon in the Triggers panel or click on the   Insert tab and choose Interactive Objects and then Trigger.  2.  When the Trigger Wizard window appears, perform the following steps:  1.  Choose what action should result from the Action drop-down. 2.  Select where this action should happen from the drop-down menu  that appears below Action  refer to the following screenshot . The  name of this drop down will change depending on which action has  been selected. For example, Slide appears if Jump to Slide is the  action selected.  3.  Select when the action occurs in the When drop-down. 4.  You should also confirm with which object the trigger is associated  in the Object drop down. This will default to the currently selected  object, but you can change this if needed.  5.  Click on OK.  3.  You should preview the project to test the functionality of the new trigger.  The options in the Action drop-down menu stay the same, while  the options within Slide, When, and Object change depending  on the action that is selected.  [ 62 ]   Chapter 3  Perform the following steps to change the order of triggers:  In the Triggers panel, click on the trigger you would like to move.  1.  2.  Click on the up or down arrow at the bottom of the Triggers panel to   reposition it.  Perform the following steps to copy, paste, duplicate, and delete triggers:  1.   In the Triggers panel, click on the trigger you wish to copy, paste, duplicate,  or delete.  2.  Click on the appropriate icon at the bottom of the Triggers panel to perform   the action. You can also use the following shortcut keys instead:     Ctrl + C to copy    Ctrl + V to paste    Delete to delete  You may find it faster to copy and paste existing triggers to new  objects rather than creating triggers from scratch each time you need  one. To do this, copy a trigger and then paste it onto one or more  objects by clicking on a single object or while pressing Ctrl or Shift  and clicking on multiple objects. Press Ctrl + V to paste the trigger to  the object s . After pasting the trigger, you can select the trigger in the  Triggers panel to quickly make any adjustment to it. Note that when  you duplicate a slide object, the triggers on that object are also copied.  [ 63 ]   Adding Interactivity  Follow along… Using Exercise 2 – Workplace Compliance, you'll add states to objects,   quickly replicate formatting and triggers to multiple objects, and create   navigation consistency with master slides.  1.  Double-click to view the 1.2 Menu slide and select the Business    Conduct note.  2.  Click on the States tab and then choose Edit States. 3.  Add a new state using the pre-built state named Hover. 4.  Duplicate this new state using the pre-built state named Visited. 5.  Select the Hover state and perform the following steps:  1.  Resize the note to be larger by dragging the bottom-left corner. 2.  Change the font color to red. 3.  Click on the Visited state and, from the Insert tab, add a checkmark  to the upper-right side of the note. Fill the note with green color and  add a shadow.  4.  Click on Done Editing States.  6.  While still selecting the Business Conduct note, click on the Create new   trigger icon and define the action to jump to slide, choose the slide 2.1  Business Conduct, and click on OK.  7.  With the Business Conduct note still selected, click on Format Painter from  the Home tab and click on the Privacy note. Repeat this for the Security note. 8.  Click on the trigger for the Business Conduct note in the Triggers panel and   press Ctrl + C to copy the trigger. On the slide, select both the Privacy and  Security notes, and press Ctrl + V to paste the trigger onto them.  9.  Edit the Privacy and Security note triggers so that they jump to the slides 3.1   Privacy and 4.1 Security respectively.  [ 64 ]   10.  From the Animations tab, set Slide Transition to Uncover Down.  Chapter 3  11.  Preview this scene and check to make sure the home button works and the   hover effects work on the post-it notes.  12.  Save the file under a new name, Exercise 3 – Workplace Compliance.  [ 65 ]   Adding Interactivity  Adding hyperlinks Storyline uses triggers to create hyperlinks. By default, you can hyperlink to a web  location  URL  or a document  local , but since hyperlinks are triggers, you can also  choose another action such as jumping to a slide.  Perform the following steps to insert a hyperlink:  1.  Select the item to which you want to add a hyperlink. If this is text,    click-and-drag to select just the portion of text where you would like   the hyperlink to appear.  2.  Press Ctrl + K, right-click, and choose Hyperlink or click on the Insert    3.  The Trigger Wizard window appears, with the options discussed in the   tab and choose Hyperlink.  following steps displayed:  1.  Link text is the text that is linked. You can change the wording of    the link text, if you wish.  2.  Select what action should be taken when the user clicks on the object.   This defaults to Jump to URL File.  3.  Enter a filename or select a file by clicking on the File icon or typing a  web address  URL . You can click on the Check URL button to make  sure the web address is valid.  4.  Click on the Configure icon to determine how the window  containing the file or URL will be displayed and what size   it should be. Click on Save and then OK.  [ 66 ]   Chapter 3  You can format the color of a text hyperlink by working with the design theme   for the course in a way similar to PowerPoint. Here's how:  1.  Choose the Design tab and click on the Colors drop-down menu. 2.   If the project is using a default color theme and you don't want to alter   the original theme, select Create New Theme Colors. If the project is using a custom color theme and you want to edit that   theme, right-click on the theme and choose Edit.  3.   4.  Locate the Hyperlink color in the theme color list and change it. 5.   If creating a new theme, you can give it a name, otherwise click on Save.  Adding buttons Buttons are an easy way of adding interactivity to a course. Storyline comes with  rectangular and oval buttons pre-configured with 6 states  normal, hover, down,  visited, and disabled . You can customize these states and add your own.  Buttons can be formatted using quick styles that are part of the current theme   found under the Format tab. They can be resized and moved just as you would   for other objects.  Holding down the Shift key while dragging any handle of a shape  constrains the aspect ratio while resizing it. Holding down the Shift  key while drawing a new rectangle or oval shape will constrain your  shape to a perfect square or circle.  [ 67 ]   Adding Interactivity  Button icons Storyline provides a library of over 100 icons that can be added to any button, either  with or without text. The color of the icon can be set from the Format tab and the size  of the icon can be adjusted by changing the font size under the Home tab.  If you customize the look of a button and want to re-use this formatting  for new buttons in the course, you can do this by right-clicking on the  button and choosing Set As Default. Once you do this, new buttons  created in the same story will take on this default button format.  [ 68 ]   Chapter 3  Perform the following steps to insert a button:  1.  Select the Insert tab and then choose Button. 2.  Pick a button style. 3.  Click-and-drag on the slide to position and size the button.  Perform the following steps to format a button:  1.  Select the button. 2.  Begin typing, if you wish to add text. 3.  Select the Format tab and choose from any of the formatting options. 4.  Add an icon to the button by selecting an icon style and color.  Follow along… In this exercise, you will continue to work with the file, Exercise 3 – Workplace  Compliance, to add interactivity, external content, and animated effects.  1.  View the Master Slide and select Master Slide Layout 2. 2.   Insert a small button in the upper-right corner of the slide. Include a house  icon on this button and change the color to grey. In the Triggers panel, click on the Add a trigger link on the new button and  configure the action so that it jumps to the slide 1.2 Menu when clicked.  3.   [ 69 ]   Adding Interactivity  4.  Return to Normal View and navigate to 1.1 Home. Add a new rectangle   button placed over the top of the words Compliance Matters! on the slide.  5.  Rename the button in the timeline from Button 1 to start. 6.  Format the new button so that it has a green fill, the word Start on it,    and a right arrow icon to the left of the word Start.  7.  Change the Hover state of the start button to a grey fill. 8.   In the Triggers panel, change the trigger for the Start button so that it   jumps to the next slide  1.2 Menu  when the user clicks on it.  9.  Slide the Start button to the 3.5 second mark in the timeline. This will force   the button to display only after the Compliance Matters! tagline appears.  10.  Expand the Sub-title group in the timeline and add a fade out animation to  compliance matters and a fade in and fade out animation to compliance box.  11.  Expand the employee group in the timeline, click on the employee object,   click on the States panel, and add a new state called Happy from the   pre-built states.  12.  Add a slide trigger that manipulates the employee image when the slide  ends. Do this by selecting the employee object  not the employee group,  rather the single employee object within the employee group , click on Add  new trigger in the Triggers panel and set the trigger to change the state of  the employee object to Happy when the timeline of slide 1.1 Home ends.  [ 70 ]   Chapter 3  13.  Save the file. 14.  Navigate to 1.4 Privacy. Be sure that you are in Normal View. 15.  You'll now link the Google search result image that you captured in an   earlier lesson so that it links to a live website. To do this, open your browser,  go to Google, and search for the definition of corporate privacy. When the  search results appear, select the URL from the browser address bar and press  Ctrl + C to copy it.  16.  Back on the 1.4 Privacy slide, select the Google image and choose Format    Hyperlink. In the Action drop down, select Jump to URL File and then   press Ctrl + V to paste the URL into the File field.  17.  Select the Browser options icon to the right of the File field  it's a globe  and  set it so that there are no browser controls and the size of the pop-up window  is custom at 800 px x 600 px. Click on OK to save those changes.  18.  You may need to move the Google image or resize it so that it doesn't overlap   the Home button you earlier added to the Master Slide.  19.  Preview this slide and save the file. You will notice that the web link is not  active during preview and the earlier zoom placed on the Google image is  not that necessary. Let's remove it by closing out of Preview, selecting the  Google image, and choosing Format  Zoom.  20.  Save the file.  [ 71 ]   Adding Interactivity  Quick publishing Preview helps catch functionality and formatting errors. It is your main tool for  quickly testing as you develop. But it's also a good practice to publish a working  sample of your project every now and again. Publishing generates a full working  sample and includes features such as links, web objects, videos, and engages  interactions that can't be seen when previewing. Publishing also lets you test   your project in multiple browsers and on multiple monitors to catch formatting   and display issues.  Publishing is straightforward and relatively quick even on larger projects. For   testing purposes, using the option Publish to the web works best for quick checks.  If you are designing a course for deployment on mobile devices,   there are other considerations to keep in mind, namely the differences  between Flash, HTML5, and iOS outputs  refer to the Appendix .   More details on the publishing process will be covered in Chapter 10,  Publishing your Story  Perform the following steps to publish to the web:  1.  Choose Publish from the Home tab. 2.  Select Web, the topmost publishing option that is listed. 3.  Storyline takes the title from the name of your file; you can change this   when publishing is to be more or less descriptive, but avoid using special  characters and spaces. The title appears by default in the upper-left corner   of the course interface and can be turned on or off.  4.  Choose a folder in which to place the published output by typing a path    or clicking on the ellipses icon and navigating to a location.  5.  Click on Publish. 6.  Click on View Project.  [ 72 ]   A note on viewing with different browsers: When you click View Project upon completion of publishing, Storyline will   open the published project in your default web browser. It's a good practice to test  the published output in different browsers and on different monitors throughout the  development process. This helps catch cross-browser functionality and design issues.  Chapter 3  Storyline publishes into a folder given the same name as the  title, followed by the word output, for example, Workplace  Compliance output. Inside the published folder, there is a  file titled story.html. This can be double-clicked to launch  the course, or you can right-click, choose Open with and  select a browser other than your default browser to view the  published output.  Follow along… In this final exercise, you'll use the file Exercise 3 – Workplace Compliance  to add zooming to images along with minor formatting tasks. At the end of this  exercise, you will publish your work.  1.  Navigate to the 1.2 Business Conduct slide and be sure that you are in   Normal View.  2.  There are Polaroid images that come with the template. You can customize   these by swapping out the images with something more specific to your  course. To do this, click on the image three times. This will select the inner  image that appears inside the Polaroid. You can also expand the picture  group in the timeline and select the image this way.  3.  Once the image is selected, right-click and choose Change Picture…, and  then navigate to where an appropriate image is on your local computer or  network. Click on Open to swap the image out with a new one.  4.  Since the Polaroids are quite small, let's add a zoom on the inner picture by  selecting it and choosing Format  Zoom. You can repeat these steps, if you  wish, for the second Polaroid.  [ 73 ]   Adding Interactivity  5.  Reduce the size of the calculator image, space out the Polaroids, and add a   little rotation. You are aiming for a bit of "white space" and balance.  6.  Preview this slide and check out the zooms you've inserted. When done,   close Preview and save the project.  7.  Now it's time to publish and test the entire course from start to finish. To do  this, click on the Publish button from the Home tab, select Web, change the  title to Compliance Matters, and select a location where you would like to  store the published output. Click on Publish to start the process.  [ 74 ]   8.  When publishing is finished, you can choose the View Project button to   test your course or you can navigate to the published output folder and  double-click on story.html to launch the course in your default browser   or right-click, choose Open with and select other browsers.  Chapter 3  [ 75 ]   Adding Interactivity  Summary This chapter introduced two very powerful features of Storyline: states and triggers,  to help you create content that is dynamic, intelligent, and responsive to the learner. The power of the no programming zone should be evident by now. Ease of use and the  ability to customize objects, states, and triggers creates huge potential for creating  exactly the kind of content and interaction you hoped you could: without a team of 10! In the previous chapter, Preview was used as a method of reviewing the work  you are developing. You will rely on Preview often, but it's also a good practice to  publish every now and again, particularly after adding a series of new slides or new  interactions. Double-checking that your work functions correctly in different browsers  and looks the way you expect on different monitors throughout development will save  you time later in the development cycle, and goes a long way to ensuring the course  operates properly for your intended audience.  Now that you have an understanding of adding interactivity to a story, let's focus on  features and techniques to make a course more approachable and engaging for your  audience. For this we need to add a human touch. We will learn how to do this, in  the next chapter.  [ 76 ]   Adding Characters and Audio  The most effective and engaging e-learning courses are ones that feel real.   These courses seem to reach out and touch the learner in a way that motivates   them to happily continue. This kind of connection is gold; it is the moment when   real learning happens, the kind of learning that is understood and retained long   after the course ends.  This chapter focuses on using Storyline features that can help you create a human  touch to your courses. Specifically, you'll learn the following:     How to add photographic and illustrated characters into an e-learning course    What expressions and poses are available    Techniques to adjust character size and position    How to create interactive conversations using characters    How to add and edit narration, both audio and captions  Examples of the human touch done well Before diving into specific Storyline features, let's examine examples of e-learning  that have a human touch and discover why this works so well for almost any subject  matter. Each example mentioned here is accompanied by a URL; take a moment to  review each example before continuing with this chapter:     Connect with Haji Kamal by Cathy Moore: A lieutenant needs to make a    good impression on a tribal leader in Afghanistan and you can help  him  http:  blog.cathy-moore.com 2010 05 elearning-example- branching-scenario       Mi Vida Loca by BBC: Learn Spanish while a mystery unfolds    http:  www.bbc.co.uk languages spanish mividaloca     Adding Characters and Audio     Mouse Party by University of Utah: Learn how drugs alter the brains of    mice  http:  learn.genetics.utah.edu content addiction drugs  mouse.html      Homestand by Roanoke Time: A look behind the scenes at a baseball   game  http:  www.roanoke.com sports homestand multimedia  interactive.html      Noble Prize winner Blood typing game. Figure out each patient's blood type  and give them a transfusion before it's too late  http:  www.nobelprize. org educational medicine bloodtypinggame game index.html      Make the Sale by Suddenly Smart: Finding the right solution for a customer   http:  www.suddenlysmart.com examples global_ex1 player.html     Using Computer Ports by Suddenly Smart: Help a colleague quickly set up a   laptop for an important presentation  http:  www.suddenlysmart.com  examples computerports2 player.html   Each of these examples has a common thread; though they cover different topics,  all do so using a human touch. This isn't about specific graphics, audio, video,  animations, or interactivity. Rather, it's about understanding the subject matter and  knowing how to reframe for the learner. The most direct route is to rewrite content  from a telling approach to a what's-in-it-for-me approach. This helps focus on the  learner and helps them understand as opposed to information delivery only.  Here are some additional tips on how you can create a connection with the learner:     Create a likeness of self: The Homestand example is simple but effective  because of the way video is used. The learner can see a mini-human just  like them in action and the learner is at the controls. This is interesting and  empowering and it instantly creates a connection. The learner wants to click  and make the person do different things. The Result is learning without any  effort at all. A nice place to be.     Create realistic situations: The Connect with Haji Kamal and BBC's Mi Vida Loca   are two great examples of connecting with the learner, bringing the learner  directly into the story. It is compelling because it's contextual, realistic, and  unfolds based on the learner's choice. From a media perspective, the characters  don't have to be high quality video or images; sketched illustrations work  equally well because the content is so well designed.     Allow participation and choice: All of the examples provide a choice and  allow the learner to make complex, not complicated, decisions. The Mouse  Party example simulates your arm going into a mouse tank, which provides  an interesting level of reality as does the Blood typing game, particularly if you  make a mistake.  [ 78 ]      Keep it concise and focused: The examples mentioned earlier have this    in common. None of them preface the learning with lengthy explanations   or instructions. The content is framed with the learner in mind. Appropriate,  contextual feedback is offered. This approach helps bring the learner into   the story, helps them pay attention, and helps maintain interest in the   subject matter.  Chapter 4  About Storyline characters Storyline provides built-in characters that you can add to a slide. The Characters  feature is very useful if you don't have access to a wide range of stock photography  and if you want to use more than just a single pose or expression.  There are several illustrated built-in male and female characters and they come in a  variety of different hairstyles, clothing, poses, and expressions. Also included is one  complete photographic female character.  Characters can be inserted as static images or can be made dynamic and   interactive using states and triggers, the latter providing you with the ability   to create responsive conversations for the learner. Once inserted, you can modify   the character as you would modify any other image; moving, resizing, cropping,  animating, or applying image effects such as glows and shadows.  [ 79 ]   Adding Characters and Audio  Character states You can add states to a character to show different expressions or poses.   The different views of a character can be displayed based on a trigger,   timeline event, or user action.  For example, you could insert a character that provides an instruction to begin  a quiz. If the learner makes a mistake during the quiz, the same character with  a different pose appears with feedback. When they finish, another pose appears  congratulating the learner.  The example uses custom states. These states were specifically created to show the  incorrect and correct poses that are triggered to display after the user submits a quiz.  Of course you can always use the built-in states, if it makes sense to do so. One  example is to use a hover state so, if the learner rolls the mouse over the character,  the character responds by changing pose and providing a hint.  Adding a character Characters can be inserted into your project from the Insert tab in the ribbon,  whereas adding or changing the state of a character is done using the Timeline,  States, and Notes panel. Let's take a look at the steps to do this:  [ 80 ]   Chapter 4  1.  While in the Normal view, select the Insert tab and click on Character in the   Illustrations section of the ribbon.  2.  Choose the Illustrated or Photographic character. 3.  Select the character to insert by scrolling through the available options on the  left side of the Characters dialog box. Click to select the character and it will  appear on the right side of the screen.  4.  For now, pick a stance for the normal state and later on you can add other   states as needed. Choose from the options that are below the selected  character on the right side of the screen. For illustrated characters, this will be  left, center, or right. For photographic characters, this will be headshot, torso,  or full. If working with an illustrated character, you can select Expression  from the top of the screen and select one of several facial expressions.  5.  Pick a pose by clicking on the Pose option at the top of the screen. 6.  Click on Insert when done.  Adding a state to a character Follow these steps to add a state to the character:  1.  Select the character on the slide that you want to add a new state to. 2.  Click on the States tab and then click on Edit States. 3.  Click on the New State button. 4.  When prompted for a state name, select either one of the built-in states,    or insert a new state's name to use a custom state.  Follow along… The exercise at the end of Chapter 3, Adding Interactivity, created a file called  Exercise 3 – Workplace Compliance. This file should be open in Storyline before  continuing. In this exercise, you will add a new global button to trigger the display of  a character who asks the learner if they need help.  1.   2.   In the Exercise 3 – Workplace Compliance file, navigate to the Menu  slide and switch to the Normal view. Insert a button in the lower-right corner, similar in size to the Home button  that appears in the upper-right corner. Change the color to blue and add a  question mark icon.  [ 81 ]   Adding Characters and Audio  Follow these steps:  3.  Edit the hover state of the button so that you can insert a help character.   1.  Click on the question mark icon on the slide, select the States panel   and click on Edit States.  2.  Select the Hover state. 3.  Select the Insert tab, choose Character, and select the    Photographic character.  4.  Atsumi is the default female character, select this character from   the left side of the Characters screen and then select Torso from   the lower-right corner.  5.  Select Pose from the top of the Characters screen and choose a pose   that gestures to the left.  6.  Click on Insert. 7.  Position the character to the left of the question mark button and   enlarge the size of the character until her hand is touching the word  Privacy on the yellow post-it note.  8.  Select the character and choose Format  Rotate  Flip Horizontal   from the ribbon.  9.  Move the character around until the image is aligned with the bottom   of the slide and appears to the left of the question mark button.  4.  While still editing the hover state, let's add a textbox to display    help information:  1.   Insert a rectangle in the center of the slide making it about   300 px x 400 px in size.  2.  Make the outline black and the fill black with a 10    percent transparency.  Insert the text, as shown at the end of this exercise, into the rectangle.  3.  Add an outer shadow of Offset Diagonal Bottom Right. 4.  5.  Format the text to Arial 16pt Bold for the first line and Arial 14pt   for the remaining. Be sure to add bullets for the paragraphs that   are below the first line and left align all text.  6.  Position the rectangle so that it appears to be touching the characters.  [ 82 ]   Chapter 4  5.  Next, let's animate these two objects:  1.  Click on the character, choose the Animations tab, and add an   Entrance animation of Fly In from the Bottom section.  2.  Click on the textbox and add an Entrance animation of Fly In    from the Left section. 6.  Click on Done Editing States. 7.  Press CTRL + F12 to preview just this slide. Test the new help button. 8.   If everything is working correctly, exit preview and save the file under   a new name, Exercise 4 – Workplace Compliance.  [ 83 ]   Adding Characters and Audio  About character conversations Character conversations are often used to mimic real-life interactions. Most  frequently you will see character conversations in scenarios or as a method to   test learner understanding of a particular concept. The following example shows  how a character can prompt the learner to make a choice and another character  respond to that choice.  Speech bubbles The Captions feature provides additional shapes that are designed to be used as  captions, pop ups, or alerts, and also as visual instructions or conversations in   speech bubbles.  Captions can be placed, sized, and formatted the same way you would format a  regular shape or image in Storyline.  [ 84 ]   Chapter 4  Adding a speech bubble Speech bubbles are found in the Captions menu in Storyline. Follow these steps:  1.  Select the Insert tab and choose Captions. 2.  Select a speech bubble style from the left side of the Captions styles. 3.  Draw the shape onto the slide. 4.  Drag the yellow handle on the point of the speech bubble to change its   position and shape.  5.  Add text and format as you normally would.  [ 85 ]   Adding Characters and Audio  Audible conversation Adding a human voice to the conversation can be an effective method of making   a connection with the learner. You can record narration directly within Storyline   or use an external software application to do this and then import the audio clip   into Storyline.  It is recommended to use the selected method consistently throughout  the project to maintain sound levels and quality across slides.  Storyline supports a variety of audio formats including .aac, .aiff, .aif, .m4a,  .ogg, .wmv, .wav, and .mp3. When you record narration, .mp3 files are generated  with an audio bitrate of 192 kbps  kilobits per second . The quality of the audio   clips in a story can be adjusted prior to publishing.  Recording narration When you record or import narration, it will appear in the Timeline wherever the  Playhead is currently positioned. You can position the Playhead to the appropriate  place in the Timeline before recording, or after dragging the resulting audio clip left  or right in the Timeline.  You will likely rely on some kind of script to read narration from.  Often the narration script is provided to learners in the form of slide  notes that provide a written transcript of spoken narration. This  transcript is not true Closed Captions that follow along as narration  plays; rather, the entire script is presented at once. Placing the script  in the Notes panel of a slide makes the script available to the learner  with the exception of when a slide is viewed in a lightbox; in this  case, the Notes feature is not accessible. When recording, you can use  the slide notes to read scripted narration.  You can record narration using the Insert tab and then selecting Sound. You will see  the Record Microphone window appear with various controls to record and edit  your narration.  [ 86 ]   Chapter 4  To record a narration, follow these steps:  1.  Select the Insert tab and click on the Sound button. 2.  Select Record Mic. 3.  Click on the Record button and speak into your microphone. 4.  Click on the Stop button when you have finished recording. 5.  You may want to click on the Play button to listen to the recording,   click on Record if you wish to re-record the narration or on Delete   to remove the entire audio clip from the slide. 6.  Click on the Save button to save the recording.  After recording or importing, a speaker icon appears in the  lower-left corner of the slide area indicating audio is present   on the slide. You can double-click on this icon to play the clip.  Importing an audio clip You can also import existing narration from the same menu, using the   following steps:  1.  Select the Insert tab and click on the Sound button. 2.  Select Sound from File and find the file you want to import. 3.  Click on the Open button to import the file.  [ 87 ]   Adding Characters and Audio  When you import slides from PowerPoint, Articulate Quizmaker, or other  Storyline projects, all audio files associated with the external content will  be available for editing. The exception is Articulate Engage where the  audio is imported but cannot be edited within Storyline as it is part of a  Flash-based interaction. Note also that because Engage interactions are  Flash, they cannot be played back on mobile devices.  Editing an audio track Storyline provides a built-in audio editor that allows you to perform basic editing  tasks on a recorded or imported audio clip. From the editor, you will see a waveform of your narration and from here you can  playback the clip, adjust volume, delete portions, and insert a silent track  this is  handy when you need to space out the narration or create a pause .  [ 88 ]   Chapter 4  Here are the steps for editing audio:  1.  Double-click on the audio clip in the Timeline to open the Audio Editor. 2.   If editing or playing back just a portion of the clip, select it first by clicking on  it and dragging it on the waveform to highlight a portion of the clip. 3.  Perform the required editing tasks including re-recording, if needed. 4.  You can cut- or copy-and-paste audio by selecting the section to cut or copy,   clicking on the Cut  Ctrl + X  or Copy  Ctrl + C  buttons from the ribbon  and then selecting where you want to paste the audio in the waveform and  pressing Ctrl + V to paste.  Accessing sound tools Once the audio has been inserted, you can access Storyline features that deal  specifically with audio in a few different ways:  [ 89 ]   Adding Characters and Audio  Synchronizing objects and narration You'll likely want to synchronize slide objects to your narration, particularly when a  slide plays back automatically without learner interaction. You can use cue points in  Storyline to make objects appear at the right moment.  Cue points can be inserted in the Timeline by listening to the narration and inserting  a cue point where you want a slide object to appear. Once you've added your cue  points, you can then align individual slide objects to them. You cannot align a group  of objects to a cue point without first expanding the group and then individually  aligning the objects within the group.  You can manually insert a cue point by right-clicking on the Timeline and choosing  Insert Cue Point at Playhead. You can insert as many cue points as you need, each  will appear in the Timeline and are sequentially numbered.  Cue points aren't necessary when synchronization isn't needed  for  example, audio plays automatically when the learner interacts with an  object  or if there are few slide objects and minimal narration  you can  easily manually adjust objects to start at a specific point in the Timeline .  [ 90 ]   Chapter 4  Adding cue points Here's how to do this:  1.  Click on the Play button in the lower-right corner of the Timeline to begin   slide playback  animation and audio .  2.  Press C on the keyboard when you want to insert a cue point. If you wish to  manually adjust it further, click-and-drag the cue point marker to the left or  right in the Timeline.  3.  Once done, right-click on an object in the Timeline and choose Align to Cue  Point. Then, select the cue point number to align the object to that cue point. If you no longer need a cue point, right-click on the cue point in the Timeline  and choose Delete Cue Point.  4.   Follow along… Continuing with Exercise 4 – Workplace Compliance, you will now create   an audio narration to add a human touch to the start of this course and for the   help character.  1.  For this exercise, you will use the audio recording capabilities in Storyline to  record the welcome information. Navigate to the Menu slide and select the  Notes panel.  2.  Type the following narration script in the Notes panel:  Hello and welcome to this course. There are three topics to cover: Business  Conduct, Privacy, and Security. You can explore these topics in any order  you wish.  3.  Let's record it. Select Insert  Sound  Record Mic…. 4.  Click on the Narration Script icon to display the script. 5.  When ready, click on the Record icon  it displays a red circle  to begin.   There will be a 3-second countdown before recording starts. Record the   script as shown.  6.  When done, click on the Record icon again  it now displays a square  to stop   the recording.  7.  Click on the Play button to listen to the recording. 8.   If everything sounds good, click on the Save button, otherwise you can  replay, rerecord, or edit the audio first.  [ 91 ]   Adding Characters and Audio  9.  A Sound icon appears off the lower-left corner of the slide confirming the  sound was recorded and is now part of the slide. Switch to the Timeline to  see the waveform representation of the sound. This displays at the top of the  Timeline and is called Sound 1.  10.  Let's time the three post-it notes so that they appear on screen as the narrator   speaks of each. Follow these steps:  1.  Click on the Play button in the lower-left corner of the Timeline.    The audio will begin playing.  2.  Press the C button on the keyboard when you hear    "Business Conduct".  3.  Repeat this for "Privacy" and "Security". 4.  Right-click on the Business Conduct object in the Timeline, choose   Align to Cue Point and select Cue Point 1.  5.  Repeat for the other post-it notes aligning to Cue Point 2 and    Cue Point 3.  11.  Press Ctrl + F12 to preview this slide. Close Preview and make any  adjustments necessary to ensure each post-it appears at the proper   time. You can do this by dragging the cue point markers right or left   and re-aligning the objects to them.  12.  Let's add a voice to our help character. Select the question mark button,    click on the States panel and select Edit States.  13.  Click on the Hover state. 14.  Not sure what each topic is about? Here's a quick explanation: 1.  Select Insert  Sound  Record Mic… and record the    following narration:  [ 92 ]   Chapter 4  2.  Play and edit the recording if needed. Save when done. You will  notice a Sound icon appearing next to the question mark button.   This audio, as part of a state, will play automatically when the   state is activated.  3.  Click on Done Editing States. 4.  Preview the slide and save the file when finished.  Creating interactive conversations Let's look at pulling together all of the information you've learned in this chapter to  create an interactive, expressive conversation between characters and the learner.  You already have the knowledge needed to do this including inserting characters,  creating states, adding audio, timing the display of slide objects, and using triggers  to create an action. So, let's give it a go!  Follow along… Be sure to have Exercise 4 – Workplace Compliance open. This exercise works  through a simple example of an interactive conversation. Forthcoming exercises will  build upon this, adding new functionality and interactivity to the conversation.  1.  Switch to Story View and double-click on the 3.1 Privacy slide. 2.  Press Ctrl + D to duplicate the slide. Rename the new copy as Phone Call. 3.

This exercise demonstrated basic interaction techniques. Most interactions   are created using the built-in quizzing feature, triggers, and variables to precisely  control what information appears and when it appears. As you progress through   this book you will have opportunities to put into practice some of the more advanced  features of Storyline.  Summary This chapter introduced some interesting, fun, and easy-to-use features of Storyline  that help add a human touch to the courses that you create.  You learned how to add characters into your story and control their expressions,  poses, and conversation through states and triggers, another powerful combination  in Storyline. Once again, this level of complexity was achieved without complicated  programming and without animation skills or design skills.  [ 96 ]   Chapter 4  Einstein once said, "Everything must be made as simple as possible. But not simpler."  Creating a human touch is born out of well-constructed and refined content, and this  is the content you should be working with in Storyline; just what is needed and no  more. Simplification is the hardest part but without it, no matter how much sparkle  and shine is added in Storyline, it will lead to uninspiring and ineffectual training.  Bringing out the human touch can be achieved through realistic conversation,  situations and practice—just like in real life and Storyline makes this easy to do.  Here are some examples of when you might consider the features you have learned  in this chapter to make your course more approachable, interesting, and realistic:     Use a character as a guide to introduce the course content, duration,   navigation, and topic summaries.     Use a character as a facilitator that can appear when you anticipate the  learner is likely to need additional help. This works remarkably well   when content is well designed and written to support the learner.     Use audio with characters to assist in role play scenarios. Audio along    with characters is more effective than text speech bubbles alone.  If you have been following along with the exercises so far, you will now have   several slides in the Exercise 4 - Workplace Compliance file with each slide  containing static and interactive content. Even with smaller files like this, it doesn't  take long before you need to look at ways to organize content. The next chapter will  introduce the concept of layers to help organize and extend slide content.  [ 97 ]    Extending Slide Content  This chapter focuses on a powerful Storyline concept called layers. Layers are   useful in organizing and extending the slide's content within a single slide as  opposed to spreading content over multiple slides. Layers can help optimize   your story by reducing the number of overall slides, making for smaller file   sizes and faster publishing times.  In this chapter you will learn:     When and why you might use a layer    How to create and edit layers    How to configure the settings of layers    The techniques for displaying and hiding layers    To work with built-in interactions that work or complement layers  About layers If you've used Articulate Studio or PowerPoint previously, you will have noticed  that each slide can contain any number of objects that can be placed in front or  behind other objects. You can do the same with Storyline by controlling the order   of slide objects in the Timeline.   Extending Slide Content  Slide layers are like slide objects that can be layered on top of each other. Think of  it like using a transparency sheet on a projector. You can place one transparency  at a time on the projector or you can add one on top of the other and keep the  information on the bottom transparency visible while adding new information to it.  Storyline slide layers can work like this with transparency or can be solid where they  do not allow objects on the base layer or other layers to show through.  Here's an example that uses a three-tab interaction. To build an interaction like this  in Articulate Studio  shown on the left , you would need to use multiple slides, one  for each tab, just like placing one transparency at a time on a projector. In Storyline,  you could also use multiple slides with hyperlinks to achieve this, however, you  might opt to use multiple layers since it would result in one slide instead of three.  This is like placing one transparency on top of another, stacking information over  multiple levels instead of spreading it over different slides. By using layers, you   keep the entire tabbed interaction together on a single slide.  [ 100 ]   Chapter 5  Layers are also useful with rollovers or button clicks to reveal glossary definitions,  pop-up tips, hints, and so on. In Articulate Studio, you'd have to create a separate  slide for the information that is to be revealed by the rollover or button click. This  second slide often contains duplicated information that leads to larger file sizes   and increased development time. There are times when layers might not be so useful, particularly when a single  slide has a lot of information in it. For editing and organization, you'll find it easier  to spread content-heavy slides over multiple slides. This helps reduce on-screen  content, making it easier for the learner to digest and easier for you to edit. Just like working with regular slides, each layer has its own Timeline, and you can  place any number of objects in a layer using all of the regular formatting commands  and Storyline features, such as animations and effects.  Some features, such as freeform dragging-and-dropping and zoom   for panning and zooming effects , aren't supported in layers, so  you'd need slides instead.  [ 101 ]   Extending Slide Content  To this point you have been working with just the base layer of a slide. This layer  appears by default as soon as the slide starts. All other layers on a slide remain  hidden from display until they are triggered to appear. This could be by the click of  a button or by a timed event; for example, when a particular image appears on the  Timeline, a layer will automatically display. Hiding layers works similarly; you can  conceal a layer by a trigger or a timed event.  Adding a layer Follow these steps to add a layer:  1.  Choose Insert  Slide Layer from the ribbon or select the New Layer icon   from the Slide Layers panel.  2.  The new layer is called Untitled Layer 1 by default. It's a good habit to give  each layer a descriptive name. You can do this by right-clicking on a layer in  the Slide Layers panel and then renaming it.  Adjusting layers You may want to hide, duplicate, delete, or create another layer. All of these  commands are found at the bottom of the Slide Layers panel. By default, all layers  except the one you're working on will appear dimmed. If you'd rather see them  in full color, you can unmark the box called Dim non-selected layers in the Slide  Layers panel.  [ 102 ]   Chapter 5  Ordering layers Slide layers display on top of the base layer. By default, objects on a layer are only  visible when the layer is viewed, however, this default can be changed. You can  configure a layer so that objects on other layers are visible when the layer is viewed,  and when this occurs, objects on other layers will appear in the same layer-order as  they are listed in the Slide Layers panel, from bottom to top. This is similar to objects  on a slide where those that are at the Timeline appear underneath those at the top. To change the layer order, select a layer in the Slide Layers panel and drag it up or  down to a different position.  [ 103 ]   Extending Slide Content  Editing the properties of a layer Each slide layer can be customized to control how it appears and functions.   Click on the small gear icon to the right of the layer name to display the Layer  Properties window. You can also right-click on a layer and choose Properties.  Formatting a layer Formatting a layer usually involves adding and editing objects on the layer.   In addition to controlling the visibility of other layers, you can also hide or   show all or some of the objects on the base layer. There is also a master slide   that can be used to create consistent formatting between layers.  Adding visibility of base layer objects Here are the steps to control the visibility of base layer objects:  1.  Select a layer and view the Timeline of the layer. 2.  Scroll down the Timeline until you see a group named Base Layer Objects. 3.  Click on the group to expand it and then click on the Show Hide icon  eye    to hide or show individual objects on the base layer. You might need to  expand the height of the Timeline panel or scroll down in the timeline   to see all of the objects within the group.  If you'd like to hide all base layer objects, it is faster to do this  through Layer Properties and checking the Hide objects on  base layer option.  [ 104 ]   Chapter 5  Adding consistency with master layouts You can create a consistent look and feel for layers, just like you can for slides,   by using master layouts.  Later in this book we'll explore quizzing and formatting quiz results using the  Feedback Master, for now, it's important to note that Storyline uses the blank   layout of the Feedback Master as the default layout for slide layers.  This means you can adjust the blank layout to customize the look and feel of  multiple layers. You can also assign different master layouts to different layers. Just  like Slide Masters save time and enable consistency between slides, so do Feedback  Masters when you have multiple layers in a project that are similarly formatted.  The following are the steps to change or modify the layout for a slide layer:  1.  Select the layer you want to change. 2.  From the Home tab, click on the Layout icon or drop-down list. Storyline   highlights the Feedback Master layout that is currently being used.  [ 105 ]   Extending Slide Content  3.  You can choose another layout to use, or from the View tab, choose  Feedback Master to change the layout as you would change a Slide   Master layout.  You can adjust the transparency of slide layers by using the  Format Background option on the slide layout in the Feedback  Master that is associated with a layer. By setting a fill color and  adjusting the transparency value, this will make objects on the  base layer appear dim, similar to a lightbox effect.  Adding content to a layer You can work with a slide layer in the same way you would work with a regular  slide. Each layer has its own Timeline so objects can be timed to appear, and  animation effects can be applied. You can even add transitions for each layer. Using Layer Properties, you can control the visibility of other layers and objects   on the base layer.  Follow along... The exercise at the end of Chapter 4, Adding Characters and Audio, created a file   called Exercise 4 – Workplace Compliance. This file should be open in Storyline  before continuing. In this exercise, you will optimize and organize the Privacy  section of the module using layers.  1.  Let's take the slides 3.2 Phone Call and 3.3 Wrong, and transform them   from slides to layers within the slide 3.1 Privacy. The first step is to add   two new layers:  1.  Navigate to slide 3.1 Privacy  be sure to be in the Normal view . 2.  3.  Rename the first layer to Phone Call by right-clicking on the layer   In the Layers panel, click on the New Layer icon twice.  and choosing Rename.  4.  Rename the second layer to Wrong.  2.  Now let's copy the information from slides 3.2 and 3.3 into the new layers: 1.  Navigate to slide 3.2 Phone Call, click anywhere in the slide and   press Ctrl + A to select all objects on the slide. Press Ctrl + C to copy  the objects.  [ 106 ]   Chapter 5  2.  Navigate to slide 3.1 Privacy, click on the Phone Call layer, and press   Ctrl + V to paste the objects.  3.  Repeat this for the slide 3.3 Wrong, and copy all the objects in the   Wrong layer of the slide 3.1 Privacy. In preparation for adding triggers to display the new layers, let's  make a few content adjustments within the layers:  4.   3.  Delete the slides 3.2 Phone Call and 3.3 Wrong.  1.  On the slide 3.1 Privacy, click on the Phone Call layer and insert    a new textbox and type the following text: Click the phone to end the call  2.  Change the text color to red and make the sentence bold. 3.  Move the text so that it appears next to the cell phone and resize    the text box so the text spans over two lines.  4.  Press Ctrl + C to copy. 5.  Click on the Wrong layer and press Ctrl + V to paste the text. 6.  Select the cell phone and then click on the New Trigger icon in    the Triggers panel.  8.   7.  Adjust the trigger so that it jumps to the slide 1.2 Menu when the   user clicks on the cell phone. In the Triggers panel, copy this new trigger by selecting the trigger  and clicking on the Copy icon at the bottom of the Triggers panel. 9.  Select the Phone Call layer, select the cell phone, and click on the   Paste icon in the Triggers panel.  10.  Select the Wrong layer and adjust the explanation text as well    as the speech bubble so that it looks similar to the following   sample screenshot.  11.  While still viewing the Wrong layer, adjust the timing of the two   objects in the Timeline as follows:  12.  Move the textbox Textbox 1  this is the text that appears below the   word Problems  so that it begins at the 1.5 second mark.  13.  Move the speech bubble Caption 1 so that it begins at the    14.  Select the Phone Call layer and adjust the following three objects in   .5 second mark.  the Timeline as follows:  [ 107 ]   Extending Slide Content  15.  Move the Why? and Okay buttons so that they begin at the 1    16.  Move the What should John say? textbox to the beginning of    second mark.  the timeline.  4.  Save the file under a new name of Exercise 5 – Workplace Compliance.  Showing and hiding a layer Layers remain hidden until they are triggered to display. Most often this is because  of something the learner did, a mouse click or hovering over an object. For example,  there might be a highlighted word on a slide, when the mouse is hovered over the  word, a definition appears and, when moved away from the word, the definition  disappears. The hover action invokes the display of a layer and moving the mouse  away triggers the hiding of the layer.  [ 108 ]   Chapter 5  Displaying a layer by mouse action Follow these steps to display a layer by mouse action:  1.  Select the object that will trigger the display of a layer and choose    Insert  Trigger from the ribbon or click on the New Trigger icon in   the Triggers panel.  2.  Under the Action drop-down menu, select Show Layer. 3.  Under Layer, select the layer you want to display. 4.  Under When, select User clicks or Mouse hovered over. 5.  Click on OK.  Hiding a layer By default, if a layer is triggered by the Mouse hovered over option, it will  automatically be hidden when the mouse moves away. You can adjust this   by de-selecting the Restore on mouse leave option in the trigger wizard. Alternatively, if the learner clicks on an object to display a layer, they will typically  need to do something to close the layer, for example, clicking on an object in the  layer such as an X  close  icon. You could also set a layer to automatically hide once  the layer timeline has completed. For this to work properly, you will need to adjust  the overall duration of the timeline to allow enough time for the learner to complete  whatever activity is on the layer.  1.  Select the layer you want to adjust. 2.  To make an object clickable in order to close a layer, perform the    following steps:  the layer.  1.  Select an object on the layer that the learner will click to hide    2.  Add a new trigger to this object and choose Hide Layer in    3.  4.   the Action drop down. In the Layer drop-down menu, select This Layer. In the When drop-down menu, select User clicks and make sure that   the object they should click on is selected in the Object drop down.  5.  Click on OK.  [ 109 ]   Extending Slide Content  3.  To make the layer automatically hide when the Timeline completes, perform   the following steps:  1.  Adjust the duration of the layer timeline to allow enough time for the   learner to complete the layer activity  reading or other interaction .  2.  Click on the New Trigger icon in the Triggers panel and select Hide   Layer under Action.  3.  Choose This Layer in the Layer drop down and choose Timeline   Ends in the When drop down.  4.  Select the current layer in the Object drop down.  Follow along… Continuing with Exercise 5 – Workplace Compliance, you will now add triggers  to control how and when each layer is displayed and concealed.  1.  Navigate to the slide 3.1 Privacy and click on the Privacy layer to ensure you   are viewing the base layer.  1.  Click on the cell phone and adjust the trigger so that it shows the   layer Phone Call when the user clicks on the phone.  2.  Click on the Phone Call layer, and then click on the Okay button and   change the trigger so that it shows the layer Wrong when the user  clicks on the button.  3.  On the same layer, click on the Why? button and change the trigger  so that the character John 1 changes its state to Thinking when the  user clicks on the button.  4.  Click on the Privacy layer and select the entire second paragraph   that displays in the scroll box on the slide. Type the following text   as its replacement:  Let's take a look at how Bob and his team deal with privacy concerns  [ 110 ]   Chapter 5  2.  The original template contains a video in a layer on this slide. Let's link to it.  Select the words "take a look" from the sentence just typed and select Insert   Hyperlink from the ribbon.  3.  Adjust the trigger so that it shows the layer called Video when the user clicks   on these words.  1.  Select the Design tab and from the Colors drop down, click on   Custom 1. This will format the hyperlink to black instead of blue.  2.  Click on the Video layer, then click on the red X  close  button.   Notice the trigger that is assigned. This trigger instructs Storyline to  hide this layer when clicked and is a common method of closing a  layer and returning to the base layer.  3.  Save the file. 4.  Preview the entire project. Test navigating to the Privacy section and   working with the layers. Remember that clicking on the cell phone  will return to the main menu.  [ 111 ]   Extending Slide Content  Features that extend a slide's content This section reviews features that work with layers or that can help you organize and  extend a slide's content. As well as these, keep in mind that any object on a slide can  be made to work with layers  showing or hiding them , using triggers.  Hotspots Hotspots are shapes that can be added to a slide and respond similar to a button.  Hotspots do not have states and they are invisible. When the learner clicks or hovers  over a hotspot, something is triggered; often this will be some kind of information  pop up contained in a slide layer or on another slide.  Hotspots are useful when you have an image on the slide that  contains irregular shapes. Hotspots can be made to be any shape  that can be overlaid on top of other slide objects.  In the following example, there is diagram that was imported into Storyline as a  single, large image. Within the image are various irregular shapes and those shapes  are made interactive by inserting hotspots on top of the background diagram.  [ 112 ]   Chapter 5  Adding a hotspot The following are the steps to add a hotspot:  1.  Choose Insert  Hotspot from the ribbon. 2.  Choose Oval, Rectangle, or Freeform and draw the hotspot on the slide. 3.  By default a trigger is created to display a layer. Choose the layer to display   or change the trigger to perform a different action such as navigating to a  different slide.  Markers Markers are a built-in way to quickly extend slide content by using click-and-reveal  effects. Markers are useful when you want to provide context-sensitive information  or when you want to reduce the volume of on-screen content, allowing the learner to  reveal the content by interacting with a slide object.  Markers are inserted just like shapes and can be placed anywhere on the slide. You  can have as many markers as you would like to have on a slide. Markers can display  text or icons and can be formatted in terms of size, style, and animation effects.  The following example shows markers being used to display map information:  Markers do not use layers to display content though it looks as if they do.   The content is built within the marker and isn't displayed on a layer or in a state.  [ 113 ]   Extending Slide Content Adding a marker The following are the steps to add a marker:  1.  Choose Insert  Marker from the ribbon. 2.  Select the type of marker from the gallery of marker options. 3.  Click on the slide where you would like the marker to appear. 4.  Enter the Title and Description. 5.  Format the text and resize or move the marker as you would resize    6.  Add media to the marker by clicking on the marker and choosing the    or move a slide object.  Format tab.  7.  Adjust the way a marker looks by choosing the Format tab and adjusting    the marker and label styles, icon appearance, and animation effect.  Follow along… Continuing with Exercise 5 – Workplace Compliance, you will enhance the  course by bringing the calculator to life.  1.  Navigate to the slide 2.1 Business Conduct and switch to the Normal view. 2.  Zoom in to the slide so that you can clearly see the calculator by dragging the   Zoom slider in the lower-left corner of the window.  3.  Once the calculator is in full view, select Insert  Hotspot from the ribbon   and choose Freeform as the shape.  4.  A crosshair will appear in place of the mouse pointer. Move the crosshair to  the upper-left corner of the equal button and click once. Repeat this for each  of the other corners. At the final corner, the hotspot should fill in transparent  green. If not, double-click in the upper-left corner of the equal button to make  certain it does.  5.  Add a new layer by clicking on the New Layer icon at the bottom of the   Layers panel and rename this layer to be Display.  7.   6.  Click on the Display layer to make it visible. The calculator on the base layer   will appear dimmed. Insert a rectangle about the same size as the display area where the total  values on the calculator appear. Rotate the rectangle slightly so that it aligns  with the display area. Fill the rectangle with a semi-transparent color with a  border and glow.  [ 114 ]   Chapter 5  8.  Add the text AT RISK to the rectangle, sizing it so that it fits properly    and is white or black in color.  9.  Since the hotspot will be invisible to the learner, let's add a marker that   instructs the learner to click on the equal button.  1.  Select Insert  Marker from the ribbon and choose the left arrow    top-left marker in the Markers library .  2.  Click to the right of the equal sign on the calculator to place    the marker.  3.  Click in the title placeholder textbox and type Are we at risk?. 4.  Click in the description placeholder and type Click the equal   button to find out.  5.  Under the Format tab within Label Styles, choose a light green    style for the marker textbox.  6.  Under Marker Styles, select solid green for the marker color. 7.  Resize the text to be more readable at 12 pt. 8.  Reduce the size of the marker text box so it tightly fits around the text    as shown in the example screenshot .  10.  Next, let's add a marker to inform the learner what the purpose of the display   area of the calculator is.  1.  Select Insert  Marker from the ribbon and choose the question mark    in the Help section of the Markers library .  2.  Click to the left of the display area on the calculator to place    the marker.  3.  Click anywhere in the title placeholder and type Risk Calculation. 4.  Click anywhere in the description placeholder and type Risk rises   when our conduct is not aligned with our corporate  expectations of proper conduct.  5.  Change the marker textbox to light red and add a solid red for the   marker color.  6.  Resize the text to be more readable and reduce the marker textbox to   fit around the text  as shown in the example screenshot .  7.  Click on the outer edge of the marker textbox, hold-and-drag the   mouse in a circle around the marker to reposition the textbox. When  you find an appropriate position, release the mouse.  [ 115 ]   Extending Slide Content  11.  Save the project and then preview the slide to test the hotspot and markers.  Button sets Button sets allow you to make objects behave like radio buttons where the learner  is able to select one object at a time out of a group of objects. You can have as many  button sets on a single slide as you like.  Here's an example. You have three questions on a slide, each requiring the learner to  pick just one of the options  the options could come in the form of built-in buttons,  images, shapes, captions, characters, and so on . You would create three button  sets, one for each of the sets of options. The learner would then be able to select one  option for each question. Without a button set, the learner would be able to select all  options or, with just one button set, the learner would be able to pick just one option  out of all the options across all the questions.  [ 116 ]   Chapter 5  Turning a set of objects into a button set Follow these steps:  1.  Select the objects you want to turn into a button set. 2.  Right-click and choose Button Set. 3.  Choose either Button set 1  this is the default name for the first button set     or choose New set and type a name. If the objects don't have a Selected state, Storyline will create one that you  can view and edit by clicking on the object and then the States panel.  4.   5.  Preview the slide to test that only one item at a time can be selected from    the button set.  Radio buttons will automatically become part of Button set 1.  If you are grouping other objects into a button set on the same  slide, you will want to choose New set, otherwise they will  also become part of Button Set 1.  [ 117 ]   Extending Slide Content  Follow along… Continuing with Exercise 5 – Workplace Compliance, you'll enhance the course  with the addition of a tab interaction and a button set in the Security section.  1.  Navigate to the slide 4.1 Security and be sure to be in the Normal view. 2.  Let's start by inserting a prebuilt tab interaction and then customizing it to   suit our needs. To do this, follow these steps:  1.  Select Insert  New Slide from the ribbon. 2.  From the Template drop down, choose Top Interactions. 3.  The interaction to insert is Folder Tabs, locate this interaction    and select it.  click on Import.  4.  Choose Current Scene from the Insert into scene drop down and   3.  Format the newly inserted slide so that its theme matches the other slides  in the course. To do this, click on the 4.2 Folder Tabs slide and select the  Design tab from the ribbon. Choose the Desktop design theme.  4.  Change the title from Folder Tabs Interaction to Security Issues. 5.  Retitle each of the tabs as follows:                  From Tab 1 to Email From Tab 2 to Passwords From Tab 3 to WIFI From Tab 4 to Stolen PC From Tab 5 to Knowledge Check  6.  Change the paper label that is held by a paper clip to Take a moment to   learn more about our most concerning security issues.  [ 118 ]   Chapter 5  7.  The content within each tab is prepopulated with sample text and images.  This content appears in a separate layer for each tab. For this exercise, let's  keep the sample content for all tabs except the last tab. Click on the Tab 5  layer to view this layer.  8.  Let's create a simple quiz using two sets of radio buttons.  1.  Change the title to Do you know?  as shown in the    following screenshot .  2.  Highlight all of the remaining sample text and replace it    with the following: What is the most frequent security breach?  [ 119 ]   Extending Slide Content  3.  Press the Enter key five to six times and type the following:  What is the most common error when handling files?  4.  Format the text so that it is red. 5.  Choose Insert  Button and select Radio Button Style 1. 6.  Click beneath the first question to place the radio button. 7.  Right-click on the button and choose Edit Text. 8.  Type Password Sharing. 9.  Click to select the button and press Ctrl + C to copy it. 10.  Press Ctrl + V to paste it. Move it to the right of the first button. 11.  Edit the text so that it says Lost or Stolen Laptops. 12.  Press Ctrl + V three times and move all of the copies below the   second question.  13.  Select all copies and place them into a new button set by    right-clicking, and choosing Button Set and then New Set.   Type the name Button Set 2 and click on OK.  14.  Space out each of the three radio buttons for the second question   and in the Home or Format tab, choose Align and then select the   Left Align option followed by Distribute Vertically.  15.  Adjust the text of each radio button from Password Sharing to:     Not backing up files        Sharing with unauthorized people Inappropriate file names  [ 120 ]   Chapter 5  9.  Now that the quiz has been created, let's highlight the correct responses and   create a new layer to display this  keep in mind this sample quiz is not a  scored or recorded quiz, rather, it's an example of using button sets for less  formal knowledge checks .  1.   Insert two ovals, making them green so that they stand out, and  placing sizing one to highlight the first response in the first question  and the other to highlight the second response in the second question   as shown in the following screenshot .  2.  Select both ovals and cut them from the slide. 3.  Add a new layer and name it Check.  [ 121 ]   Extending Slide Content  4.  Select the Check layer and paste the ovals into this layer. By creating  the ovals in the Tab 5 layer, you were able to see correct positioning.  Once on the Check layer, you cannot see other layers by default,  making it difficult to correctly position each of the ovals.  5.  Display the Tab 5 layer and choose Insert  Button and select a   button style.  6.  Click near the bottom center of the slide to insert the button.    7.   Format the button to be green, adding a right arrow icon and the  word Check. In the Triggers panel, click on the Add trigger link for the newly  created button and adjust it so that when the user clicks, it shows the  Check layer.  10.  Save the file and preview the current slide to test the tab interaction and   knowledge check.  [ 122 ]   Chapter 5  Lightbox The lightbox feature overlays content from one or more slides on top of the   current slide. Lightboxes don't work with layers, but are included in this section   to demonstrate another way that you can extend slide content.  In the following example, content from a slide can be viewed from the photo gallery  slide without navigating away from the photo gallery. This could have been set up  with each photo on a different layer, but in this case the same effect is achieved by  adding each photo to a separate slide and using lightboxes to bring the content into  the gallery slide. It's a matter of preference as to which method you choose, but in  this case, the lightbox feature may save time since it automatically dims the current  slide and includes a close button without any extra development effort. Furthermore  features that can't be used on a layer, such as viewing narration notes, can be used  with this approach.  [ 123 ]   Extending Slide Content Triggering the display of a lightbox Here are the steps needed to trigger the display of a lightbox:  1.  On the object that will invoke the lightbox, select Insert  Trigger from    the ribbon. In the Action drop down, select Lightbox slide, select the slide to place in a  lightbox, decide when this occurs, usually this will be User Clicks, and select  the object to click.  2.   3.  You can also include navigation controls within the lightbox display to    allow the learner to navigate through more than one slide while viewing   in the lightbox.  4.  Click on OK and preview the entire project.  If you preview just the current slide, the lightbox slide will not appear  when previewing. This is because it is calling up another slide that is  out of the preview range. Be sure to preview the entire project or scene  where the lighbox slide is located.  Follow along… Continuing with Exercise 5 – Workplace Compliance, you'll enhance the course  with the addition of a lightbox effect.  1.  As a final step, let's place the new tab interaction within a lightbox.  1.  Navigate back to the slide 4.1 Security. 2.   Insert a button near the bottom center of the slide.  [ 124 ]   Chapter 5  3.  Format the button to be green, adding a right arrow icon and the   word More. In the Triggers panel, click on the Add trigger link and, in the  Triggers wizard, change the Action to Lightbox in the Next slide.  4.   2.  Save the file and preview the current scene to test the lightbox. 3.  You are now finished with this sample compliance course. You may want   to take some time to clean up the course by renaming objects, adjusting  animations, and formatting. Save any changes made and preview the   entire course to review all of the work you have done to this point.  [ 125 ]   Extending Slide Content  Summary Layers are particularly helpful for slides that contain interactive content, such  as tabbed interactions and pop-up information. Layers can prevent unnecessary  duplication of slides while allowing you to keep content and interactions together,  making it easier to organize and manage your project.  Deciding when to use a layer instead of an additional slide requires some  experimenting. A general rule of thumb is, if there's a lot of content on a slide or if  some of the content doesn't naturally belong on the slide  that is, different topics ,  then using multiple slides is better; this approach can help organize topics and make  content editing simpler.  Despite the convenience of having layers within a slide, there are drawbacks in   that some features don't work in layers. This should be considered as part of your  design planning.  You've reached the point where you've learned the basics about core authoring  concepts in Storyline including triggers, states, and layers. These features are  fundamental to Storyline and practicing using them often  as well as other features  like templates, animations, characters, and button sets  will improve your ability   to finesse content and control interaction so that your courses respond exactly how  you planned.  In the next chapter, we'll explore some additional ways with which you can  transform relatively static material into intelligent interactions that respond   to the actions of the learner.  [ 126 ]   Using Variables to Customize  the Learning Experience  In this chapter, we'll explore techniques you can employ to draw the learner into  your course using Storyline variables to collect, evaluate, and respond to learner  actions. Variables are a powerful and optional method of enhancing the level of  interactivity in your courses.  In this chapter you will learn:     What Storyline variables are    How to create, name, and edit variables    Collecting and displaying variable content    Data Entry    Evaluating variable content    Creating actions based on variable content    Restricting advancements until a condition is met    Tracking and displaying progress  Storyline variables If you've had exposure to a programming language then you will find the concept of  variables familiar. Almost all programming languages make use of them. Variables  are also found in day-to-day applications, such as Microsoft Office.   Using Variables to Customize the Learning Experience  For example, in Microsoft Word you can create a mail merge; this involves a list of  names and addresses, and printing one form letter for each of the names. It appears  as though the letter is personalized, however, the letter remains the same while the  addressee changes. This bit of automation couldn't be possible without variables;   one for the first name, one for the last name, and one for the address. Variables   act as placeholders that temporarily hold information.  In Storyline, variables are used to do the same thing and more. A simple example is  prompting the learner for their name. After typing their name, it is temporarily stored  in a variable. Later on you can use the information in the variable to personalize the  course content  Hello Sally, Welcome back Bob, Good job Joan, and so on .  There are several ways that information can be placed into a variable. One is   by learner input, for example, entering their name. Another is for you to set a   default value for a variable; this is often the case for true false variables. This   value can then be adjusted, based on an action from the learner.   [ 128 ]   For example, a variable that currently has its value set to nothing can be set to Agree  if the learner clicks on a certain button, or Don't agree by clicking on another button,  as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 6  Variables open up an endless variety of customization and personalization options  that help create engaging and responsive e-learning experiences. What's really great  about variables is just how interesting it is to work with them, and how easy it is to  create powerful results. Let's take a look!  [ 129 ]   Using Variables to Customize the Learning Experience  Types of variables There are three types of variables available in Storyline:     True False: This type of variable is sometimes known as a Boolean variable.   Unlike numeric or text variables, they can have one of two states: on or off.  This type of variable can be used for things such as toggling buttons based   on user input, detecting learner activity such as where a user is in a course,   or seeking acknowledgement such as user agreement.     Number: This type of variable contains numeric values only and can be  manipulated using basic math operations  add, subtract, multiply, and  divide . Number variables are often used for scores and number of attempts.     Text: This type of variable can contain any value: numbers, letters, spaces,   and special characters. All information is treated as text and cannot be  manipulated like a number variable can.  As is the case with all variables, the information contained within is temporary   only. For example, you may have a variable called opinion and use this to ask the  learner for their opinion at several points throughout a course. When first asked,   the learner enters some information, and this is stored in the variable. The next  time you ask, the learner types something new which overwrites whatever was  previously stored in the variable.  Variables and object states seem similar but states can only hold  information for the current slide while variables can hold data  across the entire project.  Follow along… This exercise will involve creating a new project based on a prebuilt   Articulate-supplied template. You will need access to the Internet in   order to download the template. The goal for this exercise is to create   and format the project to get it ready for use with variables in later exercises.  [ 130 ]   Chapter 6  Part 1 – creating a new project and adjusting   the slides In order to create a new project and adjust the slides, follow these steps:  1.  Start a new project in Storyline. You will have a single, blank slide in    the story.  2.  Let's add content to this project, and a custom look and feel by leveraging   a prebuilt template. To do this, click on Insert  New Slide from the ribbon.  3.  Near the top center, click on Download free templates. This will open   your browser and display a page containing several free Articulate-built  templates. Look for the template named Business Circles, click to select   it, then choose Download this file  you will need to sign up for a free  Articulate account to download the templates .  4.  When prompted to Save or Open, choose Open to open the template    in Storyline. If prompted to make the file writable, click on Yes.  5.  6.  The scenes and slides in the template now appear. For this exercise   you will only need a few of the slides. Using Ctrl + click, navigate to   the following slides:  The Menu slide        Module 1: the first 2 untitled slides    Module 2: the first 2 untitled slides    Module 3: the first 2 untitled slides  7.  Ensure that Same as imported template is selected from the drop-down    list. Insert a Scene menu in the lower left corner.  8.  Click on Import. 9.   In Story View, remove the first untitled scene that contains a single,   blank slide by right-clicking on the scene and choosing Delete.  10.  Let's change the theme color by selecting the Design tab and from    the Colors drop-down menu, select the Office color theme.  [ 131 ]   Using Variables to Customize the Learning Experience  11.  Rename the first slide in each of the module scenes from Untitled Slide   to Intro, and rename the second slide in each of the scenes from Untitled  Slide to Details.  It's a good practice to rename slides using a descriptive name.  Slide names appear in the menu when the course is previewed and  published. You can change slide names later but it's more efficient  to get into the habit of naming slides the way you would want  users to see them, as you create the slides.  12.  Double-click on 1.1 Menu to view it in Normal View. 13.  Save the file as Exercise 6- Sales Training.  Part 2 – Adjusting formatting Let's continue making some adjustments:  1.  Navigate to slide 1.1 Menu then switch to Slide Master View. 2.  Delete the last two circles that appear in the center of the slide. 3.  Select the remaining three circles and group them by pressing Ctrl + G. 4.  Align the circles in the center of the slide by choosing Format  Align    Align Center from the Slide Master menu. 5.  Press Shift + Ctrl + G to ungroup the circles.  [ 132 ]   Chapter 6  6.  Navigate to the first circle  orange  and from the Timeline panel, choose the  States tab, and edit States. Change the Visited state to a light grey fill, click  on the New State icon, and name it Completed. Insert a checkmark shape  and place this beside the circle  this will be used to indicate the section is  complete in a later exercise .  7.  Repeat the step above for the other two circles. 8.  Adjust the trigger for each of the circles so that each trigger jumps to the   appropriate Intro slide  orange jumps to 2.1 Intro, blue jumps to 3.1 Intro,  and purple jumps to 4.1 Intro .  9.  Navigate to the first Module 1 layout from the left side panel. This layout  shows an orange circle on the left side of the slide. Select the orange circle   on the slide and change the trigger to jump to 1.1 Menu.  10.  Repeat this for the first Module 2 layout and Module 3 layout. 11.  Press Ctrl + S to save the file.  Part 3 – adding new slides and previewing  functionality Let's finish the initial adjustments to this project:  1.  Switch to Story View and navigate to slide 1.1 Menu. 2.  Change the Slide Advances setting in the slide panel to By User. 3.  Let's add two new slides to the project and prep them for later exercises: 1.  Press Ctrl + D to duplicate slide 1.1 Menu and rename the copy    to Start.  [ 133 ]   Using Variables to Customize the Learning Experience  2.  Right-click on slide 1.2 Start, choose Layout, and change the layout to   be the final Module 1  orange circle  layout.  3.  Switch to Normal View and type Please enter your name for the title  on the slide, and delete the placeholder box that appears in the center  of the slide.  4.  Switch back to Story View and add a new scene to the project. 5.  Name the scene End and rename slide 5.1 Untitled Slide to    You're Done.  6.  View 5.1 You're Done in Normal View, enter a title of You're Done!  And add the following text in the placeholder below the three circles:  Great job! You've completed this series and can now move on to  Level II.  4.   In Normal View, navigate to 1.2 Menu, enter a title Welcome! and  introductory text below the three circles as: There are three modules in this  course. Complete each module then click on the Next button to continue.  5.  Press Ctrl + S to save the file. 6.  Preview the entire project and test navigation; clicking each of the circles   should navigate to the respective module section, and from there clicking on  the colored circle should return to the menu. If this doesn't work, re-examine  the triggers setup in the Master Layout for the menu and module layouts.  [ 134 ]   Chapter 6  Creating variables Creating a variable involves defining a unique name, selecting the type, and setting  the initial value  or initial content  for the variable:  In the Triggers panel, click on Manage project variables  X   1.  2.  Click on the Create a new variable icon 3.  Name your variable 4.  Set the variable type 5.  Set the initial value of the variable if it is a number or true false variable 6.  Click on OK  All variables must be uniquely named with no spaces or special  characters, and the name of a variable is case sensitive. Once a  variable is created its type cannot be changed.  [ 135 ]   Using Variables to Customize the Learning Experience  Using variables For variables to be useful, they need to contain some form of content whether that is  text, numbers, or true false logic.  One common way of populating variables is through button clicks; where the learner  clicks on a button and by doing so a variable is populated with specific content. This  is easy to set up in Storyline; just create a trigger on a button but instead of jumping  to a slide, or showing a layer when the user clicks, you instruct Storyline to adjust   the content  referred to as the value  of a variable.  When working with variables you will want to ensure they are behaving the way  you intend, and contain the information you expect.  Being able to see what's stored in a variable is very helpful for testing purposes, and  you can do this by inserting a reference to a variable. This is inserted on a slide like  a normal textbox where the textbox contains the name of the variable surrounded by  percentage symbols %variablename%. When previewing or publishing, the reference  changes to show the actual content stored in the variable.  [ 136 ]   When using references for testing, you'll just temporarily insert the reference,   and then remove it once you're satisfied the variable is working as expected.   The technique of inserting references is not just for testing though. It's also   the way you display information to the learner as part of your course content    for example, learner name, current location, progress, scores, and so on .  Chapter 6  Inserting a reference to a variable In order to insert a reference to a variable, follow these steps:  1.  From the Insert tab, choose Textbox and click once on the slide. 2.  Go back to the Insert tab and choose Reference from the Text   section of the ribbon. This displays a list of project variables.   Select the appropriate variable.  3.  Click OK. 4.  Format the textbox as you normally would to adjust font color and size. 5.  Preview the slide to view the current content of the variable.  Data Entry The Data Entry feature lets you populate a variable with information the learner  types in, for example, learner name, learner thoughts on a topic, or information  needed from the learner to complete an activity or exercise. Data Entry boxes can  accept text or number content, and you can add as many as you'd like to a slide  [ 137 ]   Using Variables to Customize the Learning Experience  There are three components to consider when working with Data Entry boxes:     First, the box that will contain the information that the learner types.    Second, a trigger that sends the typed input into the variable.    Third, a reference to display the typed input  variable contents . This can be  the default of clicking away from the Data Entry box but is most often based  on a click of a button.  Inserting a Data Entry box The following steps allow you to insert a Data Entry box:  1.  From the Insert tab, choose Data Entry from the Interactive Objects    area of the ribbon.  2.  Navigate to Text Entry or Number Entry. 3.  Click-and-drag on the slide to draw the Data Entry box. 4.  Default text appears inside the box and this can be adjusted to provide   instructions for the learner, or removed altogether.  5.  Format the Data Entry box as you would any other textbox. 6.  Preview the slide to see how the Data Entry box appears and to test its    ability to accept data.  [ 138 ]   Chapter 6  When adding a Data Entry box, a new trigger is created that defines a  variable, and places the typed input into the variable when the control  loses focus  that is, when the learner clicks away from the Data Entry box .  By default, your new variable will be named TextEntry. You can change  the name of the assigned variable to something more descriptive by  double-clicking on the Mange Project Variables  X  button in the lower  right of the Triggers panel, clicking on the TextEntry name, typing a  new name and clicking OK.  Follow along… Continuing with Exercise 6- Sales Training. This exercise will set up project  variables to capture and display the learner name, and the response to a question.   This will be done using Data Entry boxes and variable references.  Part 1 – adding a Data Entry box to solicit learner  thoughts Let's start with the following steps:  1.  The first task for this exercise is to create project variables that you will use in   this exercise and the next. To create a variable, click on the Manage project  variables  X  button in the lower right corner of the Triggers panel.  2.  Create the following new variables:                  LearnerName, text, no default value Mod1Complete, true false, default value set to False Mod2Complete, true false, default value set to False Mod3Complete, true false, default value set to False Thoughts, text, no default value  3.  Switch to Normal View and enter the title Module 1 on slide 2.1. Repeat this   for Module 2 and Module 3 on slides 3.1 and 4.1 respectively.  4.  Navigate to slide 2.2 Details and type What do you think? for the title. 5.   Insert a Data Entry box in the lower portion of the slide by navigating to  Insert  Data Entry  Text Entry from the menu, and draw a box on the   slide where the Data Entry box will reside  this can be adjusted later .  [ 139 ]   Using Variables to Customize the Learning Experience  6.  Change the text inside the box to Type your thoughts here, and format the   box similar to how it appears in the image at the end of this exercise. In the Triggers panel, double-click to edit the TextEntry trigger, and change  the variable to Thoughts as the variable to use to store what the learner types  in this box.  7.   8.  Add a new layer to this slide called Feedback and go to the layer. 9.  On the left side of the slide, insert a new textbox and type What you said…    10.  Below this, insert another textbox, and type %Thoughts% to insert a reference   in bold, blue, and 14pt font.  to the Thoughts variable.  11.  Select both the textboxes, press Ctrl + D to duplicate, and position the copies   on the right side of the slide. Change the first textbox to What the experts  say… and replace the second textbox with placeholder content by typing  =lorem   and pressing Enter.  12.  Click on the base layer and insert a new button that will submit user input,  and display the Feedback Layer. Select Insert  Button and choose a button  style. Add the word Submit as text on the button. Format the button to blue  and place it beneath the Data Entry box.  13.  In the Triggers panel, adjust the button trigger so that it shows the Feedback   Layer when the user clicks on the Submit button.  14.  Select the Feedback Layer and from the Timeline panel, click on the Base  Layer Objects group to expand it, then click on the Show Hide icon  eye    to hide Button 1 and TextEntry trigger from being visible in this layer.   You might need to expand the height of the Timeline panel, or scroll   down in the Timeline panel to see all the objects within the group.  15.  Switch back to the Base Layer and press Ctrl + S to save the file.  [ 140 ]   16.  Preview this slide to test entering text and view the contents of the    Thoughts variable.  Chapter 6  [ 141 ]   Using Variables to Customize the Learning Experience Part 2 – adding a Data Entry box to collect a learner  name To add a Data Entry box to collect a learner name proceed, with the following steps: 1.  Navigate to slide 1.1 Start and add a Data Entry box to the center of the slide   similar to the image at the end of this exercise.  2.  Double-click on the TextEntry trigger in the Triggers panel, and go to   LearnerName from the Set Variable drop-down menu.  3.  Add a textbox to provide instructions to click on Next to continue, and    place this below the Data Entry box.  4.  Navigate to 1.2 Menu and insert a space and then %LearnerName% after the  word Welcome in the title. You may want to resize the textbox to be the full  width of the slide.  5.  Save the project. 6.  Preview this scene to test entering a name and view it on the Menu slide.  [ 142 ]   Refining action based on conditions Storyline conditions provide a way for you to evaluate the content of a variable  based on certain criteria such as equal to, not equal to, greater than, and less than.  You can add more than one condition by creating an AND or an OR statement. Conditions can be included on a trigger by clicking on the Show Conditions option.  Chapter 6  Conditions can be used to restrict or control movement within a course.   For example, you may want to ensure that slide 15 is complete, and the  Acknowledge button is set to a value of true in order to jump to a slide   that contains the course completion certificate.  [ 143 ]   Using Variables to Customize the Learning Experience  Conditions can also be used to display course progress. For example, there may   be an activity where the learner needs to type some comments or they need   to complete an exercise before the activity, and the current section of the   course is marked as completed.  Conditions become more powerful when used to evaluate variables along with object  states or even other variables. For example, you could have a home page with images  that represent each section of a course. When the learner reaches the end of a section,  a variable is adjusted to indicate the section has been completed and based on that,  when the user returns to the home screen, the state of the section image is adjusted to  include a checkmark. The learner is restricted from using the Next button to proceed  until all of the section images have the state of completed.  The order of conditions is important. Conditions are  evaluated, like triggers, from the top down.  [ 144 ]   Chapter 6  When defining conditions, you can create one or more conditions. When   Adding multiple conditions they are joined together using AND or OR   conditions. For example:     Condition 1: "Jump to the next slide when the media Sound 1 completes"  OR     Condition 2: "when the Continue button is visited"  There are three elements that you can apply conditions to; variables, shapes, and the  player window lightboxes.  Follow along… Continuing with Exercise 6- Sales Training, this exercise completes the   steps needed to add intelligence to the menu so that Storyline keeps track of   learner progress while restricting the learner from jumping ahead without  completing the three sections of this course.  [ 145 ]   Using Variables to Customize the Learning Experience Part 1 – setting up variables and tracking progress In the previous exercises you created three variables called Mod1Complete,  Mod2Complete, and Mod3Complete. These variables are true false and each have a  default value of false. When the learner completes a section we want these variables  to adjust to true. Follow the proceeding steps to do this:  1.  Navigate to slide 2.2 Details and switch to Normal View. 2.  Add a new trigger that adjusts the variable Mod1Complete to true when  timeline starts by changing the Value drop-down menu to Value and, in   the box next to this, choosing the value of True when Timeline starts for   2.2 Details.  3.  Copy this trigger, navigate to slide 3.2 Details, paste the trigger, and edit    it so the variable is Mod2Complete.  4.  Repeat this for slide 4.2 Details, switching the variable to Mod3Complete. 5.  Switch to Slide Master View and navigate to the Menu layout. 6.  Now we'll set up triggers that will evaluate the three completion variables,   and adjust the states of the corresponding circles on the menu slide:  1.  Add a new trigger that changes the state of Oval 1 to the    Completed state when the Timeline starts.  2.  Click on Show Conditions then click on the Add New    Condition  +  button.  3.  From the IF drop-down list, select Mod1Complete. 4.  From the Operator drop-down list, select ==Equal to. 5.  From the Type drop-down list, select Value. 6.  From the Value drop-down list, select True. 7.  Click OK twice to return to the slide. 8.  Copy this trigger twice.  7.  Edit the respective copies to adjust Oval 2 and Oval 3 following the  preceding steps. Ensure that you also double-click on the condition   and adjust the variable being evaluated so that the variable changes   from Mod1Complete to Mod2Complete and Mod3Complete.  8.  Return to Normal View and save the project.  [ 146 ]   9.  Preview the entire project, viewing each of the Details screens and testing  to ensure that each section contains a checkmark on the menu screen if the  section has been completed.  Chapter 6  Part 2 – controlling learner navigation to prevent  skipping sections Now that Storyline knows if a section has been completed, you can limit learner  movement, and prevent them from skipping ahead by placing conditions on   the Next button. Follow the proceeding steps to do this:  1.  Switch to Slide Master View and choose the Menu layout. 2.  Add a new trigger that jumps to slide 5.1 You're Done when the user    clicks on the next button.  3.  Click on Show Conditions and press the Add Conditions  +  button. 4.  From the IF drop-down list, select Mod1Complete. 5.  From the Operator drop-down list, select =Equal to.  [ 147 ]   Using Variables to Customize the Learning Experience  6.  From the Type drop-down list, select Value. 7.  From the Value drop-down list, select True. 8.  Click on OK. 9.  Click on the Add Conditions  +  button, and repeat this for Mod2Complete    and Mod3Complete.  10.  Click on OK to return to the slide. 11.  Switch to Normal View and navigate to slide 2.2 Details. There is a trigger  on this slide that controls what happens when the learner clicks on the Next  button. We want to ensure they are returned to the Menu slide if they click on  the Next button. To do this, locate Player Triggers in the Triggers panel, and  change the trigger so that it jumps to slide 1.2 Menu when the user clicks on  the Next button. Repeat this for slide 3.2 Details and 4.2 Details.  12.  Save the project. 13.  Preview the entire project, navigating to each section and attempting to click   on the Next button from the menu slide to skip to the end. You should not   be able to do this until each section is completed.  [ 148 ]   Chapter 6  Summary This chapter introduced powerful methods of customizing and personalizing course  content without the complexity of programming!  Key to this was the use of variables to temporarily store information. This information  sometimes comes directly from the learner or indirectly based on other conditions.  As you discovered, creating a variable is one thing, and doing something with   it, another. This is where triggers and references come in; to create action that   enables the display of variable content, or the manipulation of it.  You uncovered methods of refining actions by using conditional logic. Through this  you were able to base action on criteria that could be as simple as a single condition,  or as complex as multiple conditions that evaluated not only variable content but  object states as well.  Storyline provides a tremendous wealth of programming-like possibilities   without draining your brain. The trick is to be mindful of the order of events;   almost everything in Storyline is processed in a top-down manner, so placing  conditions and triggers in a logical sequence is critical to achieving the desired   results. It's a good idea to ask yourself "what do I want to do, when do I want   to do it?" to help you establish the correct order for your triggers and conditions.  The Articulate community houses a lot of information and examples on all aspects   of Storyline, including these interesting examples of using variables:     http:  community.articulate.com blogs jeanette   archive 2013 01 04 using-a-simple-storyline-number-variable-to- show-learners-how-many-objects-they-ve-found.aspx     https:  articulate-workshops.s3.amazonaws.com 2012 Storyline-  Workshop storyline-variables.html     http:  community.articulate.com tutorials products adding-text-     http:  community.articulate.com tutorials products building-a-  variables.aspx  simple-counter.aspx  Now that you've worked quite substantially on slide and layer content, let's pop   up to the thousand feet view and map out a course, creating paths for the learner   to explore from the vantage point of the driver's seat.  [ 149 ]    Creating Learning Paths  As you have seen in previous chapters, interactive e-learning contains activities,   and interactions that require learner input, and often provide simple feedback.  Sometimes more complex instruction, where the learner is provided with an  opportunity to make a decision, is needed. Based on those decisions, the learner may  be provided with feedback, or not, then routed down a specific learning path. This  technique is called branching. In this section you learn how to create branched e-learning with Storyline, including:     Principles of branching    Controlling presentation order    Understanding slide properties    Customizing slide navigation  Principles of branching Basic branching is present in most e-learning courses and is commonly disguised   as navigational choices. In its simplest form, branching helps break away from  strictly linear courses to interactive courses where the learner can make a decision   of some form.   Creating Learning Paths  Examples of navigational branching include menus that present topic choices,   areas of interest, or job roles where a learner can decide how they would like   to proceed. Depending on their choice, they are taken down one of several   available learning paths; as in the following example where the learner can   choose the character Samantha or David, or they can decide to review basic  information by clicking on the sticky note instead.  With Storyline, creating this kind of basic branching is straightforward, and   you've practiced this with the sales training course created in the previous chapter.  The same techniques can be used for complex branching when the learner needs  to make a judgment call, or they have a decision to make as part of a scenario or  simulation. As in real life, these choices are rarely as simple as a single multiple  choice question. Every decision has consequences. Branching allows you to simulate  real world situations and illustrate the effects of these decisions to your learners,  giving your courses a high level of realism.  [ 152 ]   Chapter 7  In Storyline this would normally involve concealing player navigation to focus   the learner on the situation at hand, and use custom triggers on slide objects to  control navigation.  The following example shows an interactive scenario where the learner must   review information and form an opinion before the meeting starts. There is a 5  minute countdown timer that creates a sense of urgency, just like in real life. Once  the opinion is formed, the learner clicks on go to meeting which advances to a slide  where they can make their decision, and view the consequences, then continue on  with the next scenario.  Complex branching of this kind involves challenges, choices, and consequences.  Each decision produces a consequence, with or without feedback, that moves the  learner to the next challenge, and so on. Decision-making activities help the learner  think through what they would do if the situation were really happening to them,  and help them make appropriate decisions.  [ 153 ]   Creating Learning Paths  To develop a course with branching that flows logically, you will want to draw it  out, organizing the challenges, choices, and the consequences for each choice. It  can become complex when a choice leads to the end of the branch  failure , or if the  learner is allowed a second try  looping back . Sometimes using mind map software  can help, or just paper and pen, so that you have a plan for which trigger goes where  and why that happens as opposed to adhoc while developing  which is infinitely  harder and more time consuming .  If the story is well written and the situation realistic, the result is a teachable moment  when the learner gains a new level of comprehension, and an ability to apply this  learning in the real world.  E-learning courses that contain complex branching tend to focus on principles or  situations that guide decisions. The real complexity with branching lies in realistic  and viable storytelling much more than specific steps undertaken in Storyline.  The majority of e-learning courses don't require complex branching.  Sometimes simpler is better particularly for process related topics,  or courses that focus on information awareness. All courses can  benefit from simple, navigational branching to alleviate boredom  from repeatedly clicking on the Next button. Letting learners make  some decisions along the way will help keep their attention. A note of  caution here; if no real decision needs to be made, don't make one up  just because you want to include some branching; this will backfire.   If the decision is viable and meaningful, use branching to include it  as opposed to making the decision on behalf of the learner.  [ 154 ]   Chapter 7  A number of resources are provided at the end of the chapter to support you in  writing and developing effective scenario-based and simulation-based e-learning  that involves complex branching.  Controlling presentation order To create branched scenarios or learning that provides choices to the user,   we must first take a closer look at the presentation order that Storyline uses  presentation order.  By default, slides and scenes follow a linear order. When the learner clicks on the  Next button they are taken to the next sequential slide or scene. Lines and arrows  that appear in Story View indicate the relationship between slides and scenes.  [ 155 ]   Creating Learning Paths  When you select a slide, the detail of slide relationships show as blue arrows  between slides. You can click on these arrows to adjust the trigger that defines them.  Nonlinear courses use triggers either to customize how the Next button behaves,   or to customize buttons to jump to particular branches based on learner selection.  [ 156 ]   Chapter 7  Here's how to adjust the Next button:  1.  Navigate to the slide where you want to adjust the Next button. 2.   In the Triggers panel, edit the trigger for the Next button by clicking   on the next slide link, and changing this to another slide or scene. Or  Click once on the chain link icon that appears below the slide in Story View,  and choose Link to Slide or Link to Scene.  Here's how to adjust navigational Triggers:  1.   In Story View, click on any blue line arrow that appears between slides   or scenes.  2.  The Trigger Wizard appears. Make any adjustments that are needed and  click on OK to save the changes. Story View will automatically update to  visually reflect any changes made.  Story View doesn't reflect what the learner sees. It provides a  big picture map of all course content for visual assistance while  you are developing. This view is particularly helpful when there  is branching, as you are able to easily identify where branching  occurs. Scenes translate into groups in the menu when the course is  previewed or published. Also remember that Storyline's automatic  slide numbering doesn't affect how the learner proceeds through  content when branching is used  that is, the learner may go to slide  3.4 before slide 3.3 .  Follow along… This exercise will expand the content and functionality of the course titled Exercise  6- Sales Training created in the previous chapter. In this exercise you will insert a  prebuilt two-person scenario slide and will begin to customize it so that a simulated  customer call is occurring that presents a challenge, and prompts the learner to  respond. The next exercise will expand on this to add consequences.  1.  Open Exercise 6- Sales Training and navigate to slide 3.1 Intro. 2.  While in Story View, go to InsertNew Slide from the ribbon.  [ 157 ]   Creating Learning Paths  3.  Choose Templates  Top Interactions and then go to Two-Person Scenario  from the list of available templates. Choose Import into the Current Scene,  and click on Import.  4.  Update the theme of the new slide to be the same as the others by    selecting slide 3.2 Two-Person Scenario, selecting the Design tab, and then  right-clicking on the first design theme in the list  green . Choose Apply to  Selected Slides.  5.  Let's create a new Slide Master for the scenario by selecting the View tab    and choosing Slide Master. Select the 2nd Module 2 layout  light blue   circle on right side of the slide , and press Ctrl + D to duplicate it, and   then do the following:  1.  Rename the layout to Scenario. 2.  Delete the placeholder that is in the center of the slide. 3.  Move the text placeholder that is on the right side to act as a title   at the top of the slide. Change the alignment of the text in this  placeholder to left aligned.  6.  Return to Normal View and change the layout of 3.2 Two-Person Scenario   by right-clicking on the slide, and choose Layout then select Scenario.  7.  Navigate to slide 3.2 and make the following changes to customize content:  1.  Change the title to Customer Call. 2.  Remove the Choice 3 button and text box from the slide. 3.  Delete the Choice 2 and Choice 3 layers that appear in the    Layer panel.  4.  Change the text in the speech bubble for the lady at the desk to  be I would like to speak to someone about widgets  sounding  frustrated .  5.  Shorten the length of the orange rectangle to fit within the green area   of the slide and change the text to read What should you say?  6.  Change the text box for Choice 1 to read Is there something specific   you would like to discuss?  7.  Change the text box for Choice 2 to read Not a problem. One   moment please....  [ 158 ]   8.  Change Choice 1 and Choice 2 buttons to Say This for both.  Chapter 7  9.  When the user clicks on the first Say This button, Storyline will  display the Choice 1 layer as you can see by the trigger on this  button. Edit the layer so it appears as follows:  8.  Preview slide 3.2 Two-Person Scenario. Click on the first Say This button   and notice the pop-up feedback that appears as well as the expression  changes on the characters. Click on the close button on the pop-up feedback  and then close preview.  9.  View the Trigger panel for this slide and examine the default triggers that are  controlling expressions. We won't change this but you should take a moment  to make sure you understand why they are there, and what they are doing.  10.  Save the file as Exercise 7- Sales Training.  [ 159 ]   Creating Learning Paths  Understanding slide properties Slide properties control how the slide advances, what happens when   learners revisit the slide, and player controls that are visible for the slide    the next and previous buttons . Viewing slide properties can be done in Story View and Normal View as shown   in the following screenshot:  Slide properties are important to understand in order to control slide order and  branching behavior. Let's take a closer look at each of the properties that can be  adjusted on a per slide basis.  Slide advances The default is By User. This means that the user must click on the Next button to  advance to the next slide. This can be switched to Automatically so that when the  timeline ends the next slide is displayed.  When revisiting This option controls how objects behave when the learner returns to a slide.   The default is Automatically decide which means if the slide contains objects   graphics, audio, and so on , and no interactivity, Storyline resets the slide to the  beginning of the slide's timeline when the learner returns to the slide. If the slide  contains interactive elements such as buttons or other objects that include a visited   or selected state, Storyline resumes play at the point where the slide was previously  left. You can override this by forcing a Reset to initial state or Resume saved state  on a slide-by-slide basis.  [ 160 ]   Chapter 7  For the most part the default of Automatically decide works well but there are   times when you'll need to override this. Here are two examples:     A slide plays an audio track while various images and animations appear.   When the learner returns, the slide plays this all over again from the  beginning. This is what Storyline will do since there is no interactivity.   To prevent this, switch the slide properties to Resume saved state.     There is an image on a slide that has two states, normal and a custom state   called completed. There are triggers that switch the state to Completed after  the learner does something. The learner completes what they had to do and  the object changes to the completed state which shows a checkmark on the  screen. When the learner comes back to the slide, the checkmark is gone.  Storyline will reset the slide since the image doesn't have a visited or   selected state. To prevent this, change to Resume saved state.  Slide navigation controls By default the player displays native controls including the Next and Previous  buttons for all slides when previewing or viewing a published course. There is   also a Submit button that appears automatically for slides containing a quiz.   You can turn these buttons on or off for each slide.  You may want to turn off these buttons for slides displayed in a lightbox to force   the learner to click on the red x  close  to close the lightbox. Some courses have   these buttons disabled entirely, opting for custom controls on the master slides   to create a unique playback experience.  Player features This option is an extension of slide navigation controls. By selecting Custom for the  selected slide, you can turn on or off other player controls that appear in the player  interface such as the menu, resources, glossary, notes, and the seek bar.  When creating triggers to branch to slides, be sure that you  specify the exact slide you want to jump to. If slide order changes  later, the link will remain in place using this method, as opposed  to generic links to the next or previous slide which can change if  the story structure is changed.  [ 161 ]   Creating Learning Paths  Follow along… Continuing with Exercise 7- Sales Training let's now insert slides to create  branching for the consequences of the choices the learner makes.  1.   Insert a New Slide after slide 3.2 using the Scenario layout and change   the name and title on the slide to Support Team. This slide will contain   the response when the learner decides to forward the call to technical  support. Make the following changes to this slide:  1.  Using Ctrl + click, copy the woman at the desk and speech bubble,  and the female character with headset from slide 3.2, and paste this  into the new Support Team slide.  2.  Right-click the female character and change this character to Male 1. 3.  Duplicate the speech bubble, reposition, and edit as shown in the   following screenshot.  4.  Move and enlarge the woman at the desk to the lower left corner of  the screen, and adjust the size and content of the speech bubble as  shown in the following screenshot. Insert a new button; format it to red with the text You have failed.  Click to try again.  5.   6.  Change the trigger on the new button so that it jumps to slide 3.2   when clicked.  [ 162 ]   Chapter 7  2.  Navigate to the slide 3.2 Two-Person Scenario and change the second Say   This button to jump to the new Support Team slide just created.  3.  Click on the Choice 1 layer and adjust the trigger for the One moment…   button so that it also jumps to slide 3.3 Support Team when clicked.  4.  Save the file. 5.  Duplicate 3.3 Support Team twice renaming the first copy to be Reception   and the second to Sales Team.  6.  Select 3.4 Reception and make the following adjustments:  1.  Change the title to Reception. 2.  Change the customer speech bubble to Sure! The widget is a bit   wonky but I need two more.  3.  Right-click on the male character and change this to Female 1. 4.  Change the Female 1 speech bubble to No problem. Let me transfer   5.  Change the button to green and the text in the button to Good job!   you to Sales.  Click to go to Sales.  6.  Change the trigger on the button to jump to slide 3.5 Sales Team.  7.  Select slide 3.2, click on the Choice 1 layer and change the trigger for   the second button that starts with Alright, can you….so that it jumps   to slide 3.4 Reception when clicked.  8.  Save the file. 9.  Select slide 3.5 Sales Team and make the following changes:  1.  Change the title to Sales Team 2.  Change the customer speech bubble to I'd like to order two widgets. 3.  Change the male character to Female 6 and edit the speech bubble    to be This is Sales, how may we help?  4.  Change the button to orange and text to Click to continue. 5.  Adjust the trigger on the button so that it jumps to slide 3.6 Details   when clicked.  [ 163 ]   Creating Learning Paths  10.  Select slide 3.6 Details, rename the slide, and change the title to Summary.  11.  Switch to Story View. Here you will see how the branching you just    created flows from slide-to-slide. We have stopped branching after the   first conversation but conceivably this could continue on with the sales   team, then responding to the customer, and so on.  [ 164 ]   12.  Preview the scene. Test all the ways that you can work through the scenario,  both right and wrong. You may notice upon making an incorrect choice, you  are return to slide 3.2 but other buttons have changed color  state , or the  Choice 1 layer is visible. This behavior is a default in Storyline and we'll   take a look at how to correct this next. For now, let's save the file.  Chapter 7  Customizing slide navigation Once you have course content organized and navigation, including branching, in  place you may want to take a closer look at how the slide appears to the learner.  As mentioned earlier, you can work with slide properties to configure what player  controls are visible for a particular slide, or group of slides. This feature comes in  handy when you have a course that contains a scenario or simulation where you  want the learner to interact with what is on the slide, and not be distracted by   other player controls.  To create a seamless experience, you can turn off player controls for certain sections  of a course, and use custom controls instead.  In the following example, the learner must explore the scene, clicking on the various  objects to uncover issues. Once all issues have been uncovered, a custom button  appears in the lower right corner prompting the learner to proceed. Notice that the  menu on the left isn't visible, nor are the next and previous buttons at the bottom.  [ 165 ]   Creating Learning Paths  Follow along… This exercise will continue with Exercise 7- Sales Training to touch up the   way the learner views the scenario:  1.  Switch to Story View and click on the 3.2 Two-Person Scenario slide. 2.  To ensure that this slide doesn't show previous responses when the learner   returns to it, adjust the slide properties so that when revisiting it is set to  Reset to initial state.  3.  Let's customize the player so that some of the player controls are hidden  while the learner interacts with the scenario, to do this follow these steps:  1.  Use Ctrl + click to select slides 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5. 2.   In the slide properties panel, uncheck the Previous and Next buttons  to hide the display of each.  3.  Also in slide properties, in the Player Features drop-down menu,    go to Custom for the selected slides.  4.  Be sure that the only item checked is Resources.  4.  Save the file. 5.  Preview the scene. Notice how the player controls appear at the beginning,   disappear during the scenario, and reappear at the end of the scene.  [ 166 ]   Chapter 7  Summary Branching opens up a world of possibilities that can assist in transforming typical,  linear e-learning to a whole new level of interactivity.  The most complex part of branching doesn't happen within Storyline, it happens on  paper; the process of determining how the story will unfold and upfront planning  needed to bring the story to life anticipating decision points, and determining  consequences in a logical and realistic way.  There are many storytelling resources on the internet that will help improve your  storytelling skills, and help you work through the planning stages.  Here are a few resources that will help you get a head start:     Storytelling  not e-learning specific but informative  http:  en.wikipedia.

Complex branching is less common and works best when a realistic walk-through   of simulated events is used to engage the learner, and to educate. Before planning   a complex branched scenario, be sure that you have support from, and direct access  to, subject matter experts that will help to make the story realistic, accurate, and  helpful; without their support, creating meaningful scenarios with branching   will prove challenging.  Branching is one method used to test comprehension through the decision-making  process as events unfold. Another simpler way is by inserting quiz questions into  your content and this will be the focus of the next chapter.  [ 168 ]   Testing Learner Knowledge  Most e-learning courses include some form of testing as a method of assessing a  learner's level of understanding and to provide support and feedback during the  learning process.  Traditionally this takes the form of a quiz at the end of a section or the end of a  course. With Storyline, you're not restricted to grouping all of your quiz questions  together. You can choose to add one or more questions, when and where it makes  sense to provide the learner an opportunity to assess their understanding.  In this chapter you will learn about:     The categories and types of prebuilt questions in Storyline    Creating, editing, and customizing questions    Adjusting the look and feel of questions and feedback    Converting static content into interactive quizzes    Displaying and customizing feedback, scores, and results  Question categories and types There are over 20 types of questions that you can create in Storyline. Questions are  organized into three categories:     Graded: Predefined questions to test learner knowledge that require   a response  right or wrong  with corresponding feedback, and which   can be scored     Survey: Predefined questions to collect information that don't have right    or wrong answers and are not scored     Freeform: Custom-built questions that are created from the slide's content   Testing Learner Knowledge  Each question category offers a number of question types. We'll focus on graded   and survey questions first. Here is a snapshot of the types of questions available   in Storyline:     Graded question types:  [ 170 ]      Survey question types:  Chapter 8  Creating, editing, and customizing  questions This topic walks through the basics of adding quizzes to your e-learning courses.  You will be creating a new project file that will include a variety of quiz questions  with scoring and results.  [ 171 ]   Testing Learner Knowledge  Creating graded or survey questions New questions are created in Storyline by inserting a quiz slide.  1.  From the Home or Insert tab, select New Slide. 2.  From the Insert Slides window, select the Quizzing tab. 3.  Choose the Graded or Survey category tab along the top of the window. 4.  Select a question type thumbnail and click on the Insert button.  Initial setup of graded or survey questions After inserting a new question slide, Form View of the question editor automatically  opens. This will look familiar to you if you have used Articulate Quizmaker before.  From here you can:     Enter question text    Enter answer choices    Specify the correct answer    Control how feedback is given    Allocate points for each question  Follow along… The project that you will create in this chapter is a security-related quiz that will  consist of an instructional page, four quiz questions, and a results slide. You will   be using built-in Storyline templates to construct this quiz.  1.  Create a new project and choose Insert  New Slide, select the Template    tab and then choose Character Display Panels from the template drop-down  menu along the top.  2.  Double-click on Anchor Desk to insert this into the current scene. 3.  Enter the title Identity Theft at the top of the slide and rename the    slide Instructions.  4.  Enter the following instructions where it says click to add text:         Pam is about to have her identity stolen! By answering the following questions correctly, you can help her  regain her identity.     Click on Pam to get started.  [ 172 ]   Chapter 8  5.  Delete the first blank slide. 6.  From the Insert menu, insert an illustrated character and choose Female 20.   Crop the character so that only the head and shoulders appear. Resize to  make the character larger and place in the bottom middle of the slide beneath  the instructions.  7.  Create the following new states for the character:     Normal: As it is    Hover: Change to happy expression    Reveal Eyebrows: Crop the image from the bottom so that only the   eyebrows and upper section of the image appear in this state     Reveal Eyes: copy from the bottom so that only the eyes and upper   section of the image appear     Reveal Chin: Crop so that only the section above the chin appears  In the Timeline, change the name of the character object to Pam.  8.  9.  Save the file as Exercise 8 – Identity Theft. 10.  Insert a new slide, choose the Quizzing tab and select the graded question   type of True False.  11.  In the Question Editor, enter the following question text, setting False as the   correct choice: Her driver's license has vanished. She should call the police.  12.  Save and close out of the question editor to return to the Normal View. 13.  Right-click on the second slide thumbnail in the Scene List and change    the Layout to Title Only from the Layout selections. If the question does   not appear to have the correct formatting, you can right-click on the slide  again and choose Reset.  [ 173 ]   Testing Learner Knowledge  14.  Copy the Pam character from the first slide, switch to Master Slides, navigate  to the Title Only slide layout and paste the character into the slide. Move the  character to the upper-right corner.  15.  Duplicate the character. Rename the original copy Pam no ID. Right-click   on the image and format the picture so that brightness and contrast are set   to -100% and the shape fill is a solid, dark red.  16.  Place the duplicated copy on top and align the two images. Later in this  chapter, you will add triggers that control the expression and visibility   of this character depending on the answers a learner selects during the quiz. 17.  Switch back to the Normal view, navigate to the first slide and add a trigger   to the Pam character so that it jumps to the next slide when clicked.  18.  Switch over to the second slide and add Pam's identity has been stolen!,   in bold, red letters beneath the image of Pam. In the Timeline, adjust the  timing so that the question text and the True False responses start at the   1.5 second mark.  19.  Save the file and preview the scene.  [ 174 ]   Configuring graded or survey questions There are several options that can help you configure the behavior of each question.  This is done from the ribbon in the Question Editor. To open the question editor,  click on the Edit button in the Question panel on the right side of the window.  Chapter 8  [ 175 ]   Testing Learner Knowledge  The question editor is divided into several sections. To configure a question, you'll  choose options from the Display and Scoring segments. Some formatting options  also appear in the Clipboard, Text, and Insert sections of the ribbon as shown in the  following screenshot:  Let's take a moment to review some key points regarding question configuration:     Display:      Feedback: For graded questions, you can set up one incorrect and  one correct message for a question which is then displayed once the  learner submits his her choice. Alternatively, some question types  allow you to set up a message for each choice in a question. This  is a great way to add a touch of customization to your quizzes by  provided context sensitive feedback based on learner's choice. For  survey questions, you can set up just one message regardless of the  choice the learner makes.  [ 176 ]   Chapter 8             Scoring:  By default, Storyline will move to the next slide when a question is  completed. You can control this by clicking on the More button within  the Feedback area in the question editor. From here, you can add some  formatting to the feedback text, include a sound file, and choose which  slide to branch to. For example, you have a 10 question quiz. The learner  must complete the whole quiz unless they answer question 7 correctly, in  that case, they can jump to the end. You would set up branching for that  question so the correct response jumps to a slide that follows the quiz.  Shuffle: This is a good option to enable as a way to prevent potential  cheating by using a new random order each time a question is  viewed. Keep in mind that matching and sequence question types  automatically shuffle the choices, so the Shuffle option appears  disabled. Also keep in mind that you shouldn't shuffle questions   that have an All of the above choice.     Required: This appears only for survey questions to determine if    a learner can skip a question or if it must be answered.  Score: This applies to graded questions and can be set up by a  question where you assign a point value for a correct answer and  another point value for an incorrect answer. Alternatively, for some  question types, you can set up a point value for each option. This is  often termed as a weighted quiz that tallies up your score based on  the choices you make for each question asked  that is, question 1 has  three choices where choice a is 4 points, choice b is 2, choice c is 0 .      Attempts: This gives learners extra attempts to get a question   correct. Once the learner has used up the specified number of  attempts without getting the correct answer, the question will be  scored as incorrect. Submit: When working with hotspot question types, there will be  additional options to determine when a question is scored: when the  learner clicks on the Submit button or when they click, double-click,  or right-click anywhere on the slide.          Insert:     Media: A picture, video, or sound file can be added to a question   through the options here or you can add media to a question   using Slide View instead. You can also add narration to question   or choice feedback.  [ 177 ]   Testing Learner Knowledge  Question feedback When you configure a question to include feedback, whether by question or by  choice, a new layer in the question slide is created and it contains the feedback. The  layers created are named incorrect, correct, and try again for question-level feedback  and are given the name of the question choices for choice-level feedback.  The look and feel of a question slide is controlled by Slide Masters, however the look  and feel of feedback layers in a question slide is controlled by Feedback Masters.  The Feedback Master operates just like Slide Masters and is dedicated to controlling  the formatting of question feedback and slide layers.  Feedback layers operate in the same fashion as other layers do and can be completely  customized by adding and formatting text, media, animations, transitions, and so on.  [ 178 ]   Chapter 8  Follow along… The following exercise is a continuation of the previous section that will incorporate  additional questions, feedback, and triggers. Be sure to have Exercise 8 –  Identity Theft open.  1.  While positioned on the second slide, insert a new graded quiz question.    This time, select Multiple Choice as the format.  2.  Set up the question as follows:     Question: What does identity theft refer to?     Choice 1: Stolen government documents    Choice 2: Stolen name badges    Choice 3: Online financial account access    Choice 4: All of the above  3.  Set Choice 4 as the correct answer and make sure that the answers do not   shuffle. Save and close to return to Normal View.  4.  Change the layout of this slide to be Title Only as you did with the    second slide.  5.  Choose View  Feedback Master and move the elements that are on the   master slide to appear near the bottom of the slide. Repeat this by selecting  all objects on each layout and moving those to appear properly within the  grey box at the bottom of the slide.  6.  Change the grey box on the master slide to a variation of blue. 7.  Switch back to Normal View.  Notice this slide and the previous one have correct and incorrect  layers. These are placed in by default. You can click on each layer  to see how the changes you just made in the Feedback Master  apply. You can edit feedback for this question through the layers  or by selecting Edit and using the question editor to do this.  Editing directly through layers allows more flexibility in terms   of adjusting look and feel and incorporating other objects.  [ 179 ]   Testing Learner Knowledge  in action.  8.  Save and then preview the scene to see the incorrect and correct feedback    Scoring, results, and review As you have seen, graded questions and question choices can be assigned a point  value in the question editor. When the learner submits a question, the point value   is adjusted.  If you want to show learners how they have performed on any combination   of questions, you can do that by inserting a result slide into the story. You need   to identify which questions you want to use for calculating the results and then   insert the result slide anywhere in the course. You can insert more than one result  slide in a course.  [ 180 ]   Chapter 8  Inserting a result slide You can insert a result slide by following these steps:  1.  From the Home or Insert tab, select New Slide. 2.  From the Insert Slides window, select the Quizzing tab. 3.  Choose the Result Slides tab along the top of the window. 4.  Select a result type thumbnail and click on the Insert button.  The blank result slide is most often used when you want to create a  custom slide that looks and functions in a specific way. You can build   the slide you need and then insert quiz variables to display results.  After selecting a result slide type, the Result Slide Properties window automatically  appears. Here you can determine which questions to use in the result slide, passing  score, and timer to set the maximum allowable time to complete the question s   included in this result slide.  [ 181 ]   Testing Learner Knowledge  There are also a number of options you can select to customize what is included on  a result slide. You can further customize the layout and object formatting of the slide  as you would a regular slide.  After configuring a result slide and clicking on OK at the bottom of the Result Slide  Properties window, a new slide will be inserted into your project. A sample of a  result slide as seen in Slide View is shown in the following screenshot. Depending on  the options selected, one or more variable placeholders will appear in the center of  the slide with one or more blue buttons along the bottom.  [ 182 ]   Chapter 8  The result slide includes two additional layers, one for a success message and  the other for a failure message. These messages apply to the feedback the learner  receives upon completing all of the questions included in a specific results page   individual question feedback and question choice feedback remain intact .  Unlike question feedback layers, the success and failure layers are not controlled by  a Feedback Master. You can apply other Slide Master layouts to the result slide and  can format result slide objects and layers using regular formatting commands.  [ 183 ]   Testing Learner Knowledge  Here is an example of a published quiz where the result slide indicates the learner  has passed the quiz:  You can use multiple results' slides in a course, but only one result  slide can be tracked in an LMS. You can combine scores from multiple  results' slides to create a final result slide with a consolidated score.  Customizing feedback further The result slide options allow you to include a post-quiz review and a retry button.  The retry button lets the learner retake the quiz from the beginning, updating  previously recorded scores with the latest attempt.  The post-quiz review option lets the learner go back through each question noting  the correct answers for each question. By default, Storyline indicates if the learner got  the question right or wrong with an indicator at the bottom of the question slide.  [ 184 ]   Chapter 8  You can customize the post-review feedback to add specific comments by first  making sure the Allow user to review quiz option is selected in the result slide  options, then following the steps below to customize the feedback.  1.  Navigate to the question you wish to add post-quiz feedback to and   select the Edit button in the Question panel on the right side of the   Storyline workspace.  2.  At the bottom of the window there is a Post-quiz Feedback option,    type some initial text into this field.  3.  Click on Save and Close to return to Normal View. 4.  A new layer called Review now appears in the question slide. Edit this    layer as needed to customize the wording, look, and feel.  You can edit the layout so that review formatting is consistent for all  questions by editing the Review layout in the Feedback Master.  5.  Repeat for each question that you would like to include customized    feedback for, otherwise the default will indicate correct or incorrect only.  You can hide the additional review layer content you may have set  up for a question if the learner answers the question correctly. You  can do this by placing a trigger on the review layer of the question  slide that hides the layer if the correct option  shape  has the state of  selected. The green correct banner will still appear along the bottom  during the review, but the additional content you may have created  will not appear. You can also adjust the retry quiz button so it only  displays if the quiz was failed by moving the retry quiz button to the  failure layer in the result slide.  Follow along… This exercise is a continuation of the previous exercise. You will create two new  slides and prepare them to be converted to interactive quiz questions.  1.   Insert a new slide at the end of the story using the Character Display   Panels template and the Chalkboard layout. Rename this slide to   Facebook attacks.  2.  Change the layout of this slide to Title Only. 3.  Enter the title as What are the most common types of malicious   attacks on Facebook?.  [ 185 ]   Testing Learner Knowledge  5.   4.  Move the chalkboard image to the left side of the slide and shrink its width  so that it is not covering up all of the character that appears on the right side. Insert three different illustrated characters onto the chalkboard, it doesn't  matter which ones but make each quite small. In the Timeline, name the  character objects as Character A, Character B, and Character C. Insert three textboxes beside each character as follows: viral infection,  identity theft, and bullying. Change the corresponding characters and  expressions as you see fit to express each of those titles.  6.   7.  Save the file.  8.   Insert a new slide at the end of the story using the Character Display   Panels template and the Flipchart 2 layout. Rename this slide to   Password strength.  9.  Change the title in the slide to be How strong do you think Pam's   password is?.  [ 186 ]   Chapter 8  10.  Move the character, flipchart, and text placeholder over to the left side of the   slide. Stretch out the flipchart and the text holder, then type the following  text into the text placeholder: Most people, including Pam, have a lot of passwords. Pam often uses her  mother's maiden name. How strong do you think this password is?  11.  Change the character to be Pam  Female 20 . 12.  Change the slide layout to be Title Only. 13.  Insert a rectangle for the character to hold. Name the object Password in the   Timeline and then perform the following steps: 1.  Add the following text in the rectangle:  Mother's maiden name  2.  Size the text down, make the rectangle small about 70 x 70 and adjust   the margins of the textbox, if needed, to make the text fit.  3.  Use Shape Fill and using the color picker tool fill with a yellow color   that matches the existing yellow papers the character is holding.  4.  Remove the outline and add shadow all around.  14.  Copy the newly inserted rectangle, name it strong in the Timeline, and   position it on the bottom left of the flipchart. Delete the text, fill with white  color, add a green dashed outline, and create a drag over state with a green  glow for the rectangle.  15.  Copy this rectangle twice, naming the first copy medium and the second weak   in the Timeline. Place the copies along the bottom of the flipchart and then  perform the following steps:  1.  Adjust the middle instance to have an orange dashed border and   orange glow for the drag over state.  2.  Adjust the right instance to have a red dashed border and a red glow   for the drag over state.  16.  Insert three textboxes, placing each beneath the rectangles with the words   strong, medium, and weak respectively.  17.  Select the original yellow rectangle that the character is holding and add    a drop correct state with a checkmark inserted and drop incorrect state   with an X.  [ 187 ]   Testing Learner Knowledge  18.  The last two slides will become interactive questions in the next exercise. For   now, save the file and continue onto the next topic.  Converting static content Storyline has a unique feature that allows you to take a regular slide with images,  text, and other objects, and convert it to a quiz question. This creates a freeform  question and lets you transform the existing static content into interactive content.  This is also the option you'd use to create a question from scratch when you don't  want to use the pre-built graded or survey question types.  Freeform question types There are five types of freeform questions available:  [ 188 ]   Chapter 8  You can create a freeform question by navigating to Insert  New Slide and selecting  the Freeform tab, or you can click on the Convert to Freeform button while viewing  a slide you wish to convert to a freeform question.  In both cases, the slide needs to contain at least 2 images, textboxes, shapes, buttons,  hotspots, checkboxes, or radio buttons in order to begin configuring the question.  You will also need to add any instructions and quiz question text manually on the  slide as this is not entered using the freeform question editor. You would then click  on the Edit button from the Questions panel to configure the question.  When you designate an object as a question element, a new  selected state is automatically created for the object. You can use  the Edit States option to format the selected state accordingly.  Pick One, Pick Many, and Text Entry These question types are similar to graded and survey questions. Pick One is like  Multiple Choice and Pick Many is like Multiple Response. The difference with the  freeform variation is that you can use images as items to select, instead of words only.  [ 189 ]   Testing Learner Knowledge  Text Entry and hotspot Text Entry questions operate in the same way for graded, survey, and freeform as do  hotspot questions. They appear as freeform options to make it easier to add them to  slides with existing content.  Both Text Entry and hotspot questions can be configured for use in a quiz with  scoring and feedback, or they can be configured as interactive objects for purposes  outside of quizzing. Take a look at the examples of using these two question formats  outside of a quiz.  Don't autofit the Text Entry placeholder, otherwise the display may  become very tiny if the learner enters a lot of text. Instead, using the  Format option, choose the Text Box tab, select Do not Autofit and   resize the Text Entry box to be larger.  [ 190 ]   Chapter 8  Drag-and-drop One of the most exciting features of Storyline is the ability to convert slide objects  into drag-and-drop activities. Typically, drag-and-drop is used as a quizzing  technique, but you're not limited to that—almost any object can be dragged and  dropped with any kind of feedback or action occurring during that process.  The following examples show two radically different uses for drag-and-drop;   one is an example of a quiz question and the other is an example of objects that   can be dragged-and-dropped on something to display information without using  quizzing elements like scoring or feedback:  [ 191 ]   Testing Learner Knowledge  Shortcut key This is a sixth type of freeform question that can only be accessed using the   Convert to Freeform option. This question type lets a learner answer the question   by pressing a key or combination of keys on the keyboard. An example would be   this question, "You use the Ctrl + C quick key to copy elements but what is the   quick key to paste?". When the learner presses Ctrl + V on the keyboard, they   will see correct feedback.  Keep in mind that Freeform question types are particularly  powerful outside of quizzing and can be used to easily add   a level of interactivity to content that would normally be static.  Follow along… This exercise is a continuation of the previous exercise. You'll convert two static  slides into interactive content, add a result page, and create triggers to dynamically  change the Pam character  revealing more of her identity  with each question that is  correctly answered.  1.  Navigate to the slide 1.4 Facebook attacks, switch to Normal View, and   choose Convert to Freeform from the Insert tab. Double-click on the Pick  Many option.  2.  The question editor automatically appears, prompting you to select objects  on the slide as items to choose from for this question. Click on the choice A  and select Character A, choice B is Character B, and choice C is Character C.  3.  Mark choices B and C as correct and then click on Save and Close. 4.  Navigate to the slide 1.5 Password strength and choose Convert    to Freeform. This time, double-click on Drag and Drop. In the question  editor, do the following:  1.  Check the return item to start point if dropped outside. 2.  Select the Password object as the Drag Item. 3.  Select the Weak rectangle as the correct Drop Target. 4.  On the line below, select the Medium rectangle as a Drop Target. 5.  On the line below that, do the same for the Strong rectangle.  [ 192 ]   Chapter 8  5.  Save the file and then preview the scene and review all of the questions. 6.  Now let's add a result slide to show quiz scores to the learner. To do this,   choose Insert  New Slide and under Quizzing, select the Result Slides tab.  Double-click on Graded Results Slide to insert this at the end of the story.  7.  Adjust the result's slide so that the passing grade is 75% and under   Options, check the box to allow users to retry the quiz. Click on OK   to insert the result slide.  8.  Change the layout to Title Only and add the title to Your Results! and   then move the text and quiz score variable placeholders so that they are not  overtop of the Pam character.  9.  Go ahead and save. Then preview this scene answering some questions right   and some wrong, to see how the result slide looks.  [ 193 ]   Testing Learner Knowledge  Customizing your quiz You can add buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, hotspots, and data entry to any  slide. Turn just about any object into a drag-and-drop, add triggers to control  quizzing, and customize feedback layers and branching.  Did you notice when you look at the result slide if it has a Success and a Failure  layer? You can edit these messages directly within the layer similar to incorrect   and correct question feedback.  Follow along... As the final step in the exercise for this chapter, the Pam character on the master slide  is going to be revealed a bit at a time as the learner answers questions correctly. This  will be done by leveraging quiz results' variables to add logic so the character state  changes based on the current quiz score. To do this, perform the following steps:  1.  Switch to Master Slides and navigate to the Title Only layout. 2.   In the Triggers panel, click on the New Trigger button and create a trigger  with the following specifications  be sure to select the Pam and not the Pam  no ID character :  [ 194 ]   Chapter 8  3.   In the Triggers panel, copy this new trigger four times making the following  adjustments to each of the copies:  1.  Change the state to Reveal Eyebrows when the Title Only timeline   starts if Results.ScorePercent is set to 25.  2.  Change the state to Reveal Eyes when the Title Only timeline starts   if Results.ScorePercent is set to 50.  3.  Change the state to Reveal Chin when the Title Only timeline starts   if Results.ScorePercent is set to 75.  4.  Change the state to Normal when the Title Only timeline starts if   Results.ScorePercent is set to 100.  4.  Return to Normal View, save and preview the scene.  Once you create a result slide, you can use quizzing variables  to add custom triggers anywhere within a story. The variables  are preceded by the name Results and a number if there is  more than one result slide in a story. For example, the first  result slide variables are Results.ScorePercent, Results. ScorePoints  the score the learner has achieved , Results. PassPercent, and Results.PassPoints  what is required to  pass the quiz . The second would be Results1.ScorePercent,  the third Result2.ScorePercent, and so on.  5.  You can further customize questions and the result slide by editing the   feedback messages in the slide layers. We'll do that now with the result slide:          The Success layer: Change the text to read: Congratulations, you've helped Pam regain her identity! You scored  75% or better so consider yourself a security expert! The Failure layer: Change the text to read: Unfortunately Pam is still without her identity. If you scored below  25% you should consider stepping away from the computer or  perhaps you would like to try the quiz again?  6.  Back on the Your Results! slide base layer, adjust the quiz variable   placeholder that appears in the center of the screen in small text so that  only the percentage is shown, not points. You can do this by deleting the  %Results.ScorePoints% and %Results.ScorePass% from each textbox.  [ 195 ]   Testing Learner Knowledge  7.  For this quiz, the Retry Quiz button should only appear if the learner fails   the quiz. To do this, cut the button out of the result slide base layer and paste  it into the Failure layer.  8.  Save and Preview the story.  Summary As you have seen, Storyline offers a great deal of flexibility when creating knowledge  checks for your learners. You can deviate from the traditional approach and create  highly interactive and frequent checks throughout your material.  Storyline includes a wide variety of pre-built question formats that you can  customize easily using all the standard slide editing techniques you already know  how to use. You can also create branching scenarios just by redirecting which slide  Storyline should go to if the learner answers the question right or wrong.  [ 196 ]   Chapter 8  Outside of the pre-built questions, you've seen that almost any slide can be converted  into a quiz with buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, hotspots, and data entry. And  almost any object can be transformed into something that can be dragged-and- dropped onto something else. This is very powerful not only for creating quizzes,  but also for non-scored interactions that are engaging and fun for the learner.  You can even take it further without programming or any complexity, but leveraging  the built-in quiz variables to personalize the quizzing experience based on learner  actions. And when it comes to reinforcing key concepts and messages, you have  an unlimited variety of ways to provide this through feedback messages that are  context-sensitive based on how the learner answers a question. Pretty cool stuff. More information on quizzing techniques can be found in Chapter 11, Rapid  Development. Next, we'll turn our attention toward some very interesting features  that will help you add sizzle to your story!  [ 197 ]    Adding Visual Media   to a Story  This chapter reviews the features of Storyline that enable external media assets   to be incorporated into an e-learning course. The methods and supported file   types are explored along with steps for importing media, working with web   objects, and creating interactive software simulations with recorded video.  In this chapter, you will learn:     How to work with media in Storyline    Supported media    How to import and embed media assets    The basics of screen recordings, settings, and playback modes    Creating emphasis with pans and zooms  Working with visual media Media comes in many flavors; we've already touched on images in Chapter 2, Adding  Content into your Story and in Chapter 4, Adding Characters and Audio, now we'll shift  the focus to video. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then video is priceless.  Video is one of the most effective tools to create an emotional impact. That is, if   video is done well, produced properly, and for the right reasons  to support   learning objectives .  Storyline handles a video well. There are a variety of options that allow you to bring  video into your courses, and also perform basic editing tasks like trimming and  cropping. Storyline also handles video compression very well, dramatically reducing  the size of imported videos after publishing a course without degrading quality.   Adding Visual Media to a Story  But that's not where things stop. You can use Storyline's video features to bring in  elements that you have created in other tools, such as Articulate Studio, Quizmaker  or Engage, as well as Adobe Flash and Captivate. You can even bring in content that  you didn't create directly from the web, such as YouTube videos.  The net result is that you're able to not only re-use previously created content,   but also expand your content by curating from the external sources. Powerful   stuff indeed.  Supported media  Here are the video and audio formats that Storyline supports. Notice that video  support includes Flash video  FLV  and Flash interactions  SWF ; these two   formats are for desktop, rather than mobile playback.  Video FLV, MP4, SWF The following formats are converted to  MP4 when they are imported: 3G2, 3GP, ASF, AVI, DV, M1V, M2V,  M4V, MOV, MPE, MPEG, MPG, QT,  WMV  Audio MP3 All audio formats are converted  to MP3 at 192 kbps when they are  imported. Quality settings can be  further adjusted before publishing AAC, AIF, AIFF, M4A, OGG, WAV,  WMA  Bringing media into a story – part 1 Storyline provides a few different methods for incorporating media into a story.  Regardless of the method, you will begin from the Insert tab menu in the Media  section of the Ribbon.  [ 200 ]   Chapter 9  There are two ways to bring media into Storyline:      Insert into a slide: With this method, content is imported into a slide.   It can be edited, and its playback options can be adjusted.     Link to external content: This method makes external content viewable   within a slide or in a new browser window. When within a slide, it gives   the appearance that content is contained directly within the slide, but in  reality, it is only linked. The content cannot be edited but its playback   can be adjusted.  How you choose to bring media into a story depends on what the media is and   how it is intended to be used. Let's take a look at the first type of visual media, video.  Video Video can be inserted from a file by navigating to a folder or network location   where the video file is located and inserting it. Inserted video is treated like any   other slide object. You can add Storyline playback controls to the video, and also  place other slide objects on top of the video  great for annotating video . You can   link to video from a website by using an embedded code to display it within a  slide. This allows for seamless integration of external video content. If it's YouTube  content, the video will be synchronized with the timeline, other web content   will playback independent of the timeline.  Keep in mind that when linking to external content you will be subjected to the  availability and format of the content.  You can record video from your computer's webcam  and insert it into a slide. From the Insert menu, select the  Video button and then choose Record webcam…You'll be  prompted to select the camera device, recording size and  audio device. You can record, stop, delete and preview  the recording. Once inserted, you can then manipulate the  recording as you would any video file that has been inserted  into a slide by selecting it and choosing the Options menu.  [ 201 ]   Adding Visual Media to a Story Inserting video to a story Follow these steps:  1.  From the Insert tab, click on the Video button, choose Video from file…   navigate to where the video is located, and choose Open.  2.  The video appears on the slide. You can re-position and resize the video  as you would any slide object. You can also adjust properties by selecting  the video, choosing Options in the toolbar. The options include playback  controls, alignment and sizing options.  When viewing a video in a slide, the learner can pause and play  the video just by clicking on it. If you'd like to prevent this from  happening, insert a transparent filled rectangle covering the video.  Editing video Choosing Edit Video from the video Options menu produces the screen shown  on the following page. Storyline provides basic editing capabilities. If you need  advanced video editing, such as titling and transitions, it will be easier to do this  with video editing software, such as Adobe After Effects or Premiere, and import   the edited version of the video into Storyline.  [ 202 ]   Chapter 9  Basic tasks Most of the time, video is supplied by the client and usually doesn't require editing.  Sometimes though, you may need to touch up the video using the basic editing tools  in Storyline's video editor. Here is a description of what you can do in Storyline:    Trim: This controls the duration of the clip. You can trim the beginning   and or the end of the video by dragging the red trim markers in the video  timeline. The duration is clipped to just the video in-between the beginning  and end time markers.     Crop: This is similar to cropping an image where you are adjusting the   portion of the video that you would like to be visible to the learner. In the  following example, the video of the car is cropped to just the car.  [ 203 ]   Adding Visual Media to a Story      Insert Logo: This lets you add an image that overlays the video with   optional transparency.     Zoom: This scales the video timeline up or down by dragging the slider    that appears on the left side beneath the timeline.     Play, Stop, Volume, Reset and Save are standard controls that allow you    to work with live video as you perform basic editing tasks.  Inserting video from a website Below are the steps to insert a video into your project from a website:  1.  From the Insert tab, click on the Video button and select Video from   2.  Paste the embedded code from the external website and click on the    website….  Insert button.  [ 204 ]   Chapter 9  The embed code is found in YouTube by clicking on the Share  menu, and then Embed.  3.  The video appears on the slide. You can re-position and resize the video. You  can adjust properties by selecting the video choosing Options in the toolbar.  Any kind of media can be inserted into Master Slides. There may be  times when you have a video clip that will be used on more than one  slide, such as when a video plays in the background, as an ambient  motion effect. For this kind of effect, you'll likely want to loop the  video so that it doesn't end abruptly while the learner is viewing the  slide. You can loop video and audio clips on a slide or master slide by  using two triggers, one to play the media when the timeline starts, and  the other to play the same media again, when the media completes.  This will create an infinite loop until the slide timeline ends.  Follow along… This exercise will expand upon the exercise completed in the previous chapter,  where you will add a new scene into the project that will contain live video, flash,  web site content and some interesting emphasis effects. Let's begin.  1.  Open Exercise 8 – Identity Theft and choose Save As… and name it   Exercise 9 – Identity Theft.  2.  Let's add some new slides to work with, navigate to Insert and then New   Slide. Choose the Templates tab, then from the Template dropdown menu,  choose Character Display Templates.  3.  Select Flipchart, Project Screen, Folder and Laptop Screen. From the Insert   into Scene dropdown, choose New Scene and click on Import.  4.  Switch to Story View and change the name of scene 1 to Identity Theft   and scene 2 to Security.  5.  Rename the newly inserted slides as follows:               Flipchart to Security Measures Projection Screen to Quiz Folder to Browser Laptop Screen to Warnings  [ 205 ]   Adding Visual Media to a Story  Introduction.  layout. Name this Review.  6.  Insert a new slide after slide 2.4 Warnings using the Blank layout. Name this   7.  Insert another new slide after 2.5 Introduction using the Title and Content   8.  Switch to Normal View and navigate to 2.1 Security Measures. Let's add   some initial content to this slide by following the steps below:  1.  Change the title to Browsing Securely on the Internet. 2.  Add the following into the content placeholder.  This section of the course will focus on how you can  prevent identity theft by browsing securely. To get  started, take a moment to watch this video.  3.   Insert a button, change the color to black dark grey, add a play  button icon and align it to the right then add the text WATCH VIDEO   to the button.  9.  The next step is to add a video into the project. With this video, we want to  display it in a lightbox when the learner clicks the WATCH VIDEO button.  We'll use slide 2.5 Introduction to contain the video then we'll come back   and link the WATCH VIDEO button to this slide.  10.  Navigate to slide 2.5 Introduction. 11.  Choose Insert from the menu, select the Video button and choose    Video from a website….  12.  Outside of Storyline, open your web browser and go to http:  www.  youtube.com watch?v=KWTpz0UFmdA. This is the video you will be inserting.  To do this, you need to know what the embed code is. Click on Share and  then, click Embed. Change the video size to 640 x 480 then copy all of   the text inside the Embed text box.  13.  Switch back to Storyline and press Ctrl + V to paste the embed code. Click on   Insert to complete the process. The code should look like this: <iframe width=”640” height=”480” src=”http:  www.youtube.com  embed KWTpz0UFmdA?rel=0” frameborder=”0” allowfullscreen>   14.  A video placeholder now appears in the slide. Re-size  enlarge  the video   so that it fits the entire slide size by dragging the handles of the video  placeholder.  15.  In the timeline of the slide, move the video clip so that it starts at the    .5 second mark and add a fade in animation to the video.  [ 206 ]   Chapter 9  16.  Preview this slide to see how the video plays back. 17.  Navigate back to slide 2.1 Security Measures. Add a trigger to the WATCH   VIDEO button so that it lightboxes slide 2.5 Introduction when the user  clicks on the button.  18.  Preview this scene and test the WATCH NOW button functionality. 19.  Save the file.  Be aware that if you insert YouTube video by using the Insert  video from a website option, Storyline will wrap the video in a  Flash control which means that the video will not play in HTML5  or on the Articulate Mobile Player application on an iPad. You  might consider using a Web Object instead.  Bringing media into a story – part 2 Now let's take a look at two other types of media we can include in Storyline  projects: Flash and external web content. We'll start with Flash.  Flash files A Flash file  SWF  is typically brought into a Storyline project when an interaction is  quite sophisticated and cannot be created in Storyline or the content already exists  and is being re-purposed.  If the Flash file contains interactivity, such as a drag-and-drop exercise, you will  need to insert the Flash file using the Flash button. However, if the Flash file doesn't  contain any interactivity, then you can insert it using the Video button instead.  [ 207 ]   Adding Visual Media to a Story Adding Flash to a story Follow these steps to add Flash into your project:  1.  From the Insert tab, click on the Flash button for an interactive Flash file,    or click on the Video button for a non-interactive file.  2.  Navigate to where the Flash file is located and choose Open. 3.  A placeholder appears on the slide  white, black or transparent . You can    re-position and resize the Flash file as you would any slide object.  4.  You can adjust the properties by selecting the placeholder choosing    Options in the toolbar. The options include playback controls, alignment   and sizing options.  Web content This includes websites, blogs, wiki's, forums, RSS Feeds, Twitter, Facebook, Screenr  – you name it, you got it. Almost everything on the web, including images and flash  files can be viewed within a slide in Storyline. It doesn't have to be from the external  web either, it can be html-based content in local folders or network drives.  You can include web content in two ways, by linking it within a slide or displaying it  in a new browser window. The former will make it seem as if the content is directly  on the slide. You can add scroll bars if the content is wider or longer than the slide  size. You can have multiple web objects on a slide but keep in mind that web objects  remain on top of other slide objects, even when placed on a master slide.  You can use the Web Object feature to incorporate interactions  that you've created with other software, even legacy Flash content  created with tools like Articulate Engage. These interactions,  applications and websites will typically operate as expected since  Storyline is just linking to the content, not interacting with it. The  external content must work properly with iFrames in order for it  to work properly within a web object. Note that Web Objects are  supported in the Articulate mobile player for the iPad, as well as  HTML5, however Flash content within, isn't.  [ 208 ]   Chapter 9  Adding web content to a story When inserting web content, Storyline looks for the start location, which will be a  fully qualified URL like http:  www.articulate.com or a local or network folder  that contains web content. Web content folders include a starting file that Storyline  will look for called index.html. If the starting file is named something different, like  index.htm or start.html, you will need to rename it to index.html.  1.  From the Insert tab, click on the Web Objects button and enter the web   address where the content is located, or click on the folder icon to browse   to a local file folder that contains web content.  2.  Click on the Test Link button to ensure the content launches properly.    By default, Load Web Object automatically is selected, you can uncheck   this if you want the learner to be able to control when the content plays back.  If the Web Object is set to not load automatically, you will likely   want the placeholder to display a helpful image for learners. To do this,  right-click the Web Object placeholder and select Change Picture then  browse to the image you want to use, and click on Open.  3.  Decide how to display the content, in the slide or in a new browser window.   If a new browser window is chosen, you can display all browser controls,  no address bar or no controls at all. You can also set the window size to  anything you'd like.  4.  Click OK. A placeholder appears that you can re-position and re-size.  Follow along… Continuing with Exercise 9 – Identity Theft, let's insert variations of live   web content into the Security section of our course.  1.  Navigate to 2.2 Quiz and change the title to Security Quiz. 2.  Cisco, the hardware company, offers a variety of free security quizzes for    the public. We're going to leverage this pre-made content into our course by  carrying out the following the steps:  1.  Click on the Web Object icon in the content placeholder on the slide. 2.  Outside of Storyline, open your web browser and go to   http:  newsroom.cisco.com feature-content?type- webcontent&articleId=515300. Beneath the video containing  the quiz is the embed code. We don't need all of the code as we are  concerned with just the SWF Flash file. Copy just the web address  that follows src= in the embed code.  [ 209 ]   Adding Visual Media to a Story  3.  Switch back to Storyline and press Ctrl + V to paste the embed code. Click  on the Test Link button to ensure the address is correct, and then click on  Insert to complete the process. The address should look like this: http:   newsroom.cisco.com documents 10157 2025611 SecurityQuiz4b.swf.  4.  Re-size the web object placeholder so that it appears to the right of the   character that is on the slide.  5.  Preview this slide to see how the web object behaves. Notice that Storyline  doesn't allow a web object to be viewed when previewing. The story needs  to be published, however, there is a workaround. Close out of Preview and  right-click on the web object placeholder, and then choose Preview. You can  preview this content in the slide. Clicking anywhere outside of the slide   stops preview.  6.  Save the file. 7.  Now, let's move on to slide 2.3 Browser and add some information    and instructions for an upcoming practice:  1.  Navigate to slide 2.3 Browser and change the title to Ultra    Safe Browsing.  2.  Add a text box on top of the file folder with the following:  When you're finished reading the tips, click on the Next  button to continue.  8.  Click the Web Object icon in the content placeholder and enter the    web address of http:  www.dummies.com how-to content top-ten- internet-security-tips.navId-323075.html?print=true and click   on Insert.  9.  Preview the web object then Save the file.  [ 210 ]   Chapter 9  Screen recordings and interactive  simulations Storyline includes a number of standalone tools included within the product, one   of which is the Screen Recording tool. This tool has its roots in a complementary   free service that Articulate offers, called Screenr  http:  www.screenr.com .  Recording a screen The screen recording tool allows you to record an area of your screen up to 2046 x  2046 pixels in size. Note that, if you have multiple monitors, you can only record  on one monitor at a time. Recording happens from the Insert tab by clicking on the  Record Screen button. A dashed outline of the area to record appears with controls  along the bottom.  [ 211 ]   Adding Visual Media to a Story  You'll see two dropdown menus along the bottom of the recoding screen with the  following choices:     Recording size: The default recording size is 720 x 540 pixels. This can be   adjusted to 720 x 405 for a 16:9 ratio full screen, a select window, or a custom  size, by adjusting the bounding box.     Microphone selection: Storyline will use your default recording device, but  you can change this by clicking on the down arrow that appears to the right  of the sound volume indicator.     Recording options: Clicking on the gear icon will display recording   options. You can set up keyboard shortcuts to stop, pause resume and take  a screenshot by clicking in the boxes and pressing the desired key or key  combination. You can also adjust microphone and speaker settings. Under  Options, you can turn on the Move new windows into recording area so  all windows that are opened while recording are captured. If the recording  includes the system tray area of the screen, you can conceal the Storyline icon  that appears there by checking System tray icon.  A recording can be used multiple times within a project and in more than one way:     As a video: This inserts a non-interactive video for the learner to watch.    As a step-by-step demonstration: Storyline understands when you have   clicked the mouse and where, during a recording, these mouse click locations  are converted to hotspots that can be used as an interaction where the learner  must choose the right steps. The best example for a step-by-step recording  would be a software simulation, but it's also useful for detailed diagrams and  equipment simulations.  Steps to record a screen Perform the following steps to record a screen:  1.  Choose Record Screen from the Insert menu. 2.  Adjust the bounding box to overlay the area you wish to record. You can also  move the box by hovering over the lower left edge until a four-headed arrow  appears, then click and drag the box without re-sizing it.  3.  Click on the Record button to begin. A three second countdown appears   before recording starts.  4.  Record your steps then click on the Done button to finish the recording.  [ 212 ]   Chapter 9  5.  Give the recording a name. 6.  Decide how to insert the recording, as a video or step-by-step slides. 7.  Click on the Insert button.  Once a recording has been created, it is listed in the Insert menu under Record  Screen. If it has already been inserted into the story, an In Use stamp will appear  next to it.  Step-by-step recordings inserted in View  mode View mode inserts a screen recording as a demonstration for learners and is not  interactive. Learners can watch the process or production in action as Storyline  annotates the original recording with captions and mouse click visuals and sounds.  [ 213 ]   Adding Visual Media to a Story  As with all step-by-step recordings, the recording is edited and distributed   over several slides, each slide containing a single interaction with feedback   layers. It's best to create a new scene to house step-by-step recordings to which   will help keep slide content organized.  Step-by-step recordings inserted in Try mode Try mode inserts a screen recording as an ungraded assessment allowing for the  opportunity to practice steps. This type of recording is interactive and provides  optional guidance, visual mouse cues, and correct feedback as the learner explores.  [ 214 ]   Chapter 9  Step-by-step recordings inserted in Test mode Test mode is a screen recording that is configured as a graded exam. This variation  does not provide guidance or hints but offers both correct and incorrect feedback  as the learner click on hotspots. A results slide can be optionally created upon  completion and, as with other quiz types, you can limit the number of attempts   the learner is able to try before correctly completing all steps.  Once a step-by-step recording has been inserted, you can edit the slides   as you would any other slide – changing layout, adding objects, altering   captions, hotspots and feedback.     If you are recording a web application or web page, it's  recommended that you use Internet Explorer as it provides a rich  set of data to the Windows Accessibility API. This is how Storyline  collects information about your screen recording. Other browsers  provide little information, so details will be missing from captions  and steps might be omitted.  [ 215 ]   Adding Visual Media to a Story Fine tuning the recording In some cases, you may need to fine tune the recording. Perhaps when it was  recorded, there was a mistake made and you'd like to remove it, or perhaps the  timing of a step is slightly off. In that case you can adjust the start and end   frames of the recording through a feature called Action Fine Tuning. Here's how: 1.  Navigate to the slide that you'd like to adjust in a step-by-step recording. 2.  Right-click on the slide and choose Action Fine Tuning. 3.   Just below the recording, in the playback area, drag the start frame and   end frame markers along the timeline until the clip is showing just what   you want to keep. You can also click on the Previous Frame or Next Frame  buttons to move a frame at a time back or forward for precise selection.  4.  Click on Play to preview how the slide will look. You can reset any changes   made by clicking on the Reset Original Timing button, otherwise, select  another slide from the dropdown menu if there's more editing to do, or   click OK to finish.  [ 216 ]   Chapter 9  Follow along… Continuing with Exercise 9 – Identity Theft, in this part of the exercise   you will create an interactive software simulation that tests learner knowledge   of key security features of a web browser.  1.  Navigate to 2.4 Warnings and change the title to Browser Security. 2.  Add the following text on the laptop monitor:  It's your turn to practice. In this knowledge check you will need  to locate the Security Options in the browser.  3.  Add a button with a play icon, aligned to the right, and with the words    BEGIN TEST.  4.  Outside of Storyline, open your web browser and re-size the window to be  fairly small, about 800 x 600 – something close to what you think would fit  width-wise in a Storyline slide. Go to https:  google.com in the browser.  We're going to record the steps to open the security tab in your browser.   You might want to practice this. In Internet Explorer the steps would be  Tools  Internet Options  Security. Switch back to Storyline when   you're ready to record. In Storyline, choose Insert, then Record Screen from the menu. Select Record   your screen….  5.   6.  Re-size and position the recording bounding box to cover the    browser window.  [ 217 ]   Adding Visual Media to a Story  7.  Click on the record button and perform the steps to open the security tab.  1.  Move the mouse to the Tools menu and click. 2.  Select Internet Options. 3.  Select the Security tab. 4.  Click on OK. 5.  Move the mouse to the LOCK icon in the browser toolbar and    click to view the details.  6.  Click the X to close the certificate details window.  8.  Click on Done and name the recording, Security Tab. 9.  Select Step-by-step and choose Try Mode. 10.  Insert a new scene called Security tab and click on the Insert button. 11.  Switch to Story View. Here you can see the new recording split over   numerous slides in the new Security Tab scene.  12.  Select this scene and Preview the scene. Test out the steps by making the   correct choices then preview again making some mistakes so that you can   see the feedback messages.  13.  Double-click on the first slide in the step-by-step series and take a look at  how the slide is set up. There should be a hotspot over the Tools menu in   the screen recording that appears on the slide. Look in the Triggers panel  and you'll find a trigger for that hotspot. Slide layers have automatically   been created to try again, correct, and hint related messages. All the slide  layers can be adjusted, in terms of look and feel, like you would a regular  layer. You might want to look at how the other slides in the step-by-step  series have been set up to familiarize yourself with what Storyline has   done before continuing with the exercise.  [ 218 ]   Chapter 9  14.  Navigate to any slide in the step-by-step series then right-click on one of the  recordings in a slide and choose Action Fine Tuning…, this opens an editor  that lets you edit this portion of the overall recording. You can click on the  Play button on the left side of the playback in this segment. Notice the timeline  indicates the start and the end of just this portion of the step-by-step. You can  drag those points forward or backward to fine tune exactly what should be  viewed on this slide and for this portion of the interaction. We won't make   any changes so you can click on the Cancel button to return to the slide. 15.  Navigate to slide "2.4 Warnings" and add a trigger to the BEGIN TEST   button so that it lightboxes slide "3.1 Click the Tools menu item" when   the user clicks on it.  16.  Preview the entire project. Try out the BEGIN TEST button to ensure    it displays the step-by-step recording in a lightbox.  17.  Save the file.  You can export a recording as an MP4 file or individual frames,  by right-clicking in the preview area in the Record Screen menu.  Creating emphasis with pans and zooms  The Zoom feature within Storyline is a feature that you will find useful for creating  emphasis without a lot of effort. This feature lets you give learners a close-up view  of an area of the slide at any point during slide playback. You can time this with  narration or sound effects and you   can create multiple zooms which, when set next to each other in the timeline,   results in a panning effect.  You could use this feature to highlight content that is part of a detailed map or  diagram, where zooming into a specific area lets the learner gain additional insight.  It could also be used to give the learner a sense of heightened involvement, or to  create dramatic emphasis during by zooming into an area that   the learner should be concentrating on.  [ 219 ]   Adding Visual Media to a Story  Each zoom region can be sized and positioned wherever you'd like  on the slide. All zoom regions appear in the timeline and each has  a set start time and duration. If the zooms are not in order, use the  timeline to move them around into the correct order. Unlike other  objects in the timeline, multiple zoom regions remain on a single  row and are executed from left to right. When a zoom ends, the  screen reverts back to full size.  [ 220 ]   Follow along… As a final touch to the Exercise 9 – Identity Theft course, you'll create a review  slide that leverages the video that you've recorded to emphasize key browser settings.  Chapter 9  1.  Navigate to 2.4 Warnings and change the player trigger in the Triggers panel   from jump to next slide to jump to slide 2.6 Review.  2.  Go to slide 2.6 Review and view in Normal view. 3.  Title the slide Review. 4.  Choose Insert and then click on the Record Screen dropdown. Click on the  screen recording that is listed then insert as Video on a single slide. Choose  the Security scene to insert into, and then click on the Insert button.  5.  Cut the video from the newly created 2.7 Untitled slide by selecting it and   pressing Ctrl + X, and then paste it into slide 2.6 Review by pressing Ctrl + V.  You can then delete slide 2.7 Untitled.  6.  Back on slide 2.6 Review, resize the video so that it fits within the grey area   of the slide, ensuring that it is aligned in the center of the slide.  7.  Before we add the zoom effects, let's first edit the video to shorten it a bit.    To do this, right-click on the video and choose Edit Video.  1.  Click on the Trim button. 2.  Drag the left trim marker in the timeline all the way back to the    left side.  3.  Drag the right trim marker to about the 6 or 7 second mark. You'll  need to play the video a few times to get the end point correct. We  want the video to end before the Security tab window appears.  4.  Click on the Crop button and crop the video so just the upper half    of the video will be visible on playback.  5.  Click on Save & Close.  8.  Back on the slide, enlarge the video and align it so that it is centered on    the slide. Insert an oval shape to circle the https in the address bar. Change the color   of the oval to red and add a shadow. Duplicate this and move the second  copy over the top of the lock icon that is also in the address bar.  9.   [ 221 ]   Adding Visual Media to a Story  10.  Next, let's add a zoom effect on this slide, so that when viewed, the slide will  zoom up to the https, then pan over to the lock icon and then zoom back out  to full size. To do this, follow these steps:  1.  Select Insert, then choose the Zoom Region button. 2.  A green bounding box appears on the slide, drag the handles and  reposition this to cover the general area of where the https appears. 3.  Click on the Zoom Region button again and repeat for the lock icon.  11.  In the Timeline panel, you will see two zoom region items along with the   two ovals you inserted. We need to change the timing and duration of these  elements. Use the image below as a guide.  12.  Preview the slide. If the zoom regions don't look right it could be that they   are not in the right order. You can determine which zoom region is zooming  first by selecting each on the timeline. Make sure that zooming to the https  appears first  leftmost  in the timeline. To do this, locate the zoom object in  the Timeline and drag it to the left so it appears before the other.  13.  Let's also adjust the duration of the zoom transition to slow it down a little.  Click on Zoom 1 in the timeline, then on the slide, right-click anywhere in  the zoom region box and choose Zoom transition speed and set it to slow.  Repeat for the second zoom region.  14.  Preview again to make sure it operates as you expect. 15.  Save the file. 16.  Change the player trigger in the Triggers panel on slide 1.6 Your Results   so that it jumps to slide 2.1 Security Measures when the user clicks on the  Next button.  [ 222 ]   17.  Navigate to slide 2.1 Security Measures and add a new trigger that jumps    to slide 1.1 Instructions when the user clicks on the Previous button.  18.  Preview the entire project. Note that web objects will not be viewable during  preview. Test the navigation of the course to make sure it functions properly  and that the quizzes and other interactions are also functioning as expected.  Make any tweaks you find necessary and Save the file.  Chapter 9  [ 223 ]   Adding Visual Media to a Story  Tips on working with video Here are some helpful pointers when working with video:     Video doesn't necessarily mean actual video footage, it could be animations,           motion infographics, self-running presentations and cartoon animations,  such as those created with Code Baby or Xtranormal. If you know your way around PowerPoint, you can use its animation and  transition effects to create sophisticated sequences, then export them as a  movie. You can import the movies into Storyline as a .wmv file, or if you are  using PowerPoint 2013, choose the .mp4 format for reduced file size and  seamless integration with Storyline. If you're working with actual video, and if the video is a talking head,   where a person is talking without a lot of motion, then you may want to add  a little creativity to encourage learners to pay attention. You can incorporate  Storyline zoom regions, shapes, animations and other objects to the video  as overlays or next to the video to annotate and visually reinforce what the  person in the video is speaking about. The Storyline timeline lets you specify  precisely when slide objects appear and disappear, so you can easily enhance  a talking head video.  Summary This chapter focused on ways that you can enhance your courses by incorporating  a variety of visual media including video from the web and custom, interactive  simulations. Video can be engaging, even a low-budget video can work well in   an e-learning course, if it serves to enhance motivation or understanding of the  subject matter.  Video done poorly comes off as an unnecessary bell and whistle. You'll want to   make sure that other techniques, like animations, an information popup, or a link   to a job aide, are considered first. If it can be done simpler without impairing the  learning event, then it should be.  [ 224 ]   Chapter 9  However, if video is the best choice then you need to decide, if you will create   an original production from scratch or curate it from the vast volumes of publicly  accessible media available on YouTube, Vimeo and other sources.  The techniques used in Storyline to incorporate video into your stories are also the  same techniques you'd use to bring in other types of content from websites, blogs,  forums, Twitter feeds and live web cams.  We've reached that special moment in a book when everything has come together.  We've travelled from the very beginning to create a new course and arrived here,  with a multimedia rich and interactive course. It's now time to publish so that we   can share our courses with others!  [ 225 ]    Publishing your Story  This chapter takes a closer look at how a course looks when previewed and published.  We'll take a look at the options that are available to customize colors and controls that  surround course content and the methods and formats for publishing a course.  In this chapter, we will focus on:     Previewing projects    Customizing the player    Publishing    Publishing to the web    Publishing with tracking    Other publishing options    Considerations  Previewing projects While working through the various exercises contained in this book, you have had  plenty of opportunity to use the preview feature. This is a helpful feature during  the development process that allows you to view a sample of how a slide or scene  is functioning without going through the publishing process. It's quick and dirty,  particularly if you leverage the shortcut keys, Ctrl + F12 to preview the current slide,  Shift + F12 for the current scene, and F12 for the entire project.   Publishing your Story  Don't forget that preview doesn't mean save. Your project and  all of your work will remain unsaved until you specifically  choose the Save option. There is no autosave built into  Storyline, so save often.  However helpful preview can be, there are some elements in your course that you  won't be able to see while previewing. For those, you will need to publish in order to  fully test functionality. Here's what can't be seen using preview:     Web objects    Videos inserted from websites    Content imported from Articulate Engage    Triggers containing JavaScript    Hyperlinks    Links to other slides that are not a part of the previewed range  Though you can't preview a web object using the preview feature,  you can see it by right-clicking on the web object placeholder in the  slide and choosing Preview. This shows the web object content but  not the slide functionality, so it's a partial preview. HTML 5 content can't be previewed in Storyline. When previewing,  you'll always see the Flash version. To view the HTML 5 version,  publish and launch it in a supported HTML 5 browser. You can  also manually locate the story_html5.html file in the root of the  published output to launch the HTML 5 version. The same applies  for the IOS or iPad version.  Customizing the Player When you previewed the exercises in this book, you probably noticed that course  content, words, media, and other objects on a slide, were surrounded by an interface.  This is called the Player and it can be as minimal as a 10 pixel border all the way  around a course or more elaborate to include logos, menus, and playback controls.  [ 228 ]   Chapter 10  You can make the player transparent by giving the illusion   that there is no player at all by adjusting the player colors;  Base bg, Base border, and Base slide_bg are set   to 100 percent transparent.  What's really great with this feature is that Storyline lets you fully customize how the  Player looks and what features appear on it. You can then save that setup and reuse  the player with other Storyline projects; a big time saver and a great way to deliver  consistent results.  [ 229 ]   Publishing your Story  Customizing the player is done by clicking on the Player option from the Home tab.  Player options are wide and varied; we'll highlight some of the features you should  be aware of and take some time to get to understand better. First, let's take a look at  the player interface:  [ 230 ]   Player properties review After clicking on the Player option, a number of properties appear and they are  organized in three sections in the RIbbon at the top; layout, data, and custom.  Chapter 10  [ 231 ]   Publishing your Story Features You can rename, remove, add, and reposition the Player tabs that appear along the  top and sides of the player from this area. This is a powerful feature that can be used  to make various forms of supporting content available to learners at any point during  the course. The Controls area at the bottom of the Properties window defines the  default appearance for playback controls for all slides in the story. Most of the options  here can be overridden at the slide-level with the exception of volume, search, and  logo. Make sure that the Course Title, if checked, isn't left blank or contains special  characters or symbols, as this is known to cause issues with some LMS's.  Menu When the Menu tab is enabled in the Features area, a menu option appears showing  the learner what's inside the course. By default, each scene and the slides within are  grouped using the names of the scenes and slides as depicted in the story itself.  You would usually make adjustments for how the menu content appears by using  friendly scene and slide names, and removing slides the learner doesn't need to see  listed in the menu or have direct access to. An example might be to remove subtopic  slides leaving just the major topics visible from the course menu. Removing a slide  from the menu doesn't delete the content, it just hides it from displaying as an item   in the menu.  In the following example, the left column shows that the course menu, by default,  lists all of the scenes and slides in the course. After some adjustments, the middle  column shows only two of the three scenes and fewer slides. The right-most column  shows how these menu adjustments look when published:  [ 232 ]   Chapter 10  You can change the name of the scenes and slides and re-order them. Renaming  slides in the menu does not change the actual slide names used in the story. In  fact, any adjustments you make to how the menu is displayed will not affect the  functionality of the course or the presentation order of the content.  The menu shows slide numbering alongside the slide name. If you re-order slides,  the numbering can appear to be out of sequence. This number sequencing doesn't  actually appear to the learner, by default, no menu appears at all. You can adjust this  in Menu Options by clicking on the gear icon in the lower right corner and checking  the number entries in the menu automatically. When you do this, numbering  appears sequential to the learner.  [ 233 ]   Publishing your Story  Also within Menu Options, the Navigation Restriction drop-down controls how  the learner moves through a course. The default is Free, meaning learners can  use the back and next buttons as well as the menu to view the presentation in any  order they'd like. You can change this to Restricted so learners are able to move  backward but can't skip ahead or you can choose Locked which forces learners to  view content in the order you've designed. They won't be able to move backward   or forward unless there is a specific trigger allowing them to do so. The Following is a screenshot of the Menu options that are accessed by clicking on  the Gear icon:  [ 234 ]   Chapter 10  Resources This feature lets you attach supporting content, such as file attachments and links  in the Resources tab that appears at the top of the Player. Content contained in any  Player tab is accessible throughout the course.  Glossary The glossary lets you include terms and definitions. This content, though accessible  throughout the course, is not directly linked to any terms that may appear within the  slide content.  Colors and effects You can alter the color of the player by switching from one built-in theme to another.  You can also alter a theme and create new themes with individual color changes  for various elements similar to how you would alter other theme colors found in  Storyline and PowerPoint. What's interesting is that you can control the transparency  levels for almost all elements, allowing for greater design options. You can save a  color scheme so that it can be used for other Storyline projects.  Text labels This feature lets you customize the default text that appears in the player and the  course. For example, you may want the Notes tab to appear as transcript or the  Previous button to be called Back instead. Storyline supports multiple languages   as well.  Other This option lets you specify how a published course appears in a browser.   The options you set here will relate to the size and design of your story as well   as the quality of media within. You can allow the learner to maximize the browser  window and have the course scale to fill the window. Storyline stretches the content  to achieve this effect. Since Storyline content is raster not vector, lower resolution  images may appear fuzzy when stretched beyond their original dimensions. You   can lock the player at an optimal size so that the course won't stretch, but if your  story size is 720 x 540 and it's being played back on a large, high resolution monitor   it will appear quite small.  [ 235 ]   Publishing your Story  You can set the Resume option so that when a learner returns to the course, Storyline  will prompt to resume, so they can choose to pick up from where they left off, or this  can be set so the course always automatically resumes, or never resumes. This can be  further configured so the resume action occurs only if the course is running in an LMS.  Current Player This option lets you save the current player settings, along with the glossary and  resources, as a new player that can be used for other Storyline projects that you   work on. You can also share players with other Storyline users by leveraging the  import and export options found here.  Follow along… In this exercise you will work with the player to configure some of the settings.  Following the exercise, there is a list of the key player properties that you can review.  1.  As a first step, open Exercise 9 – Identity Theft and save it as   Exercise 10 – Identity Theft.  2.  Click the Player button on the Home tab. You can see in the preview   windows that all of the scenes in this project along with all of the slides   are visible in the menu. We don't want the learner to see everything,   so let's work with the menu to tidy this up:  1.  Click on the Menu tab 2.  Rename the 1.2 menu item to be Help Pam 3.  Delete menu items 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 by selecting each and clicking   on the red x delete button at the bottom of the window. Remember  deleting here doesn't delete the actual slide, just the items in the  menu list in the player.  4.  Delete 2.2 Quiz and 2.5 Introduction; we don't want learners to jump  to the quiz, and the introduction is a video that appears in a lightbox  so it shouldn't be visible in the menu.  5.  Delete the entire last scene with children  slides , scene 3 Security Tab,   as this is the step-by-step interaction that the learner will get from a  link on another slide so it doesn't need to appear in the menu. Notice  that the preview window is updating as you are making changes.  [ 236 ]   Chapter 10  3.  Select the Features tab and navigate to Notes to include any details that   appear in the Notes panel on each slide. Note that content is edited on each  slide in the Notes area and typically is used as a transcript for voice narration  but can include any text.  4.  Navigate to the Notes item, then using the up arrow  beneath the Player tab   click it several times so the Notes tab appears in the top bar left section. Look  at the preview window to see if it is correctly positioned. You can also click  on the tab to see how it looks expanded.  5.  Add a resource by clicking on the Resource tab and then click on the   New Item icon in the lower left corner. Enter the Articulate website   address of www.articulate.com and click on Test to make sure it   works and then click on Save. It would be great to provide the introduction video to learners no matter  where they are in the course as a quick reminder of some of the key  messages. Let's add a new custom tab to the player to achieve this:  6.   1.  Click on the Features tab and then click on the New Item icon that   appears beneath the Player tab.  2.  Type the tab name as Video then set it so that Storyline places the 2.5   Introduction slide into a lightbox when the user clicks on the tab.  7.  Click on Colors and Effects and change the Color Scheme to Black. 8.  Click on OK to save the player changes.  [ 237 ]   Publishing your Story  9.  Preview the entire project and note the player changes, particularly the  custom Video tab, link in the resources tab  which won't work during  preview , and the Notes tab.  10.  While still previewing, navigate to the Review slide in the Security section.   Notice that the recorded video plays back but there aren't any controls on  the player to allow the learner to pause this video. This is where preview can  really help you fix things as you go. We caught this problem, so let's change it:  1.  Close out of preview and switch to Story View 2.  Navigate to the 2.6 Review slide and on the right side under Player   Features, select Custom for the selected slide  3.  Check the Seekbar option. 4.  Preview just this slide to ensure the seekbar is visible and you can   control the recorded video.   5.  Save the file.  [ 238 ]   Chapter 10  Publishing When the time comes to fully test your course in the environment it will reside  in, you will need to publish the project. This is typically done locally using one  of the five available publishing formats: Web, Articulate online, LMS  Learning  Management System , CD, or Word. Once published, the resulting files and folders  are usually copied to a web folder, network location, or LMS.  The first time a project is published, it will take a few minutes to complete in order to  generate the necessary files and folders as well as optimize and compress audio and  video files. Subsequent publishing will go a little faster.  Published output Storyline doesn't publish a single file, it actually creates hundreds of files contained  in a few folders. The entire published output folder structure will need to be copied  to the hosting destination in order for the course to operate correctly.  Here is an example of the published output folder:  [ 239 ]   Publishing your Story  Publishing to the web Use the Publishing to the Web option when you'd like the course to be accessible   on the web or an internal intranet and you don't need to track learner progress   or completion.  1.  To begin, from the Publish tab, navigate to the Web option and give the   course a Title and a Description.  2.  Enter the optional details by clicking on the ellipses buttons to the right of   Title.  3.  Choose a publish location. By default this is Documents\My Articulate   Projects but you can change this by clicking on the ellipses next to the Folder  location box.  4.  Decide if you are going to include support for HTML 5 devices and or the   Articulate Mobile Player app for the iPad.  5.  Adjust the player to be used, if needed, and the quality settings to fine tune   audio and video compression.  6.  Click on Publish.  [ 240 ]   7.  After publishing is complete, a window appears notifying you that the   publishing process was successful. You can then view the published course  or you can e-mail, ftp, zip it, or open the folder where the published output  files are located.  Chapter 10  [ 241 ]   Publishing your Story  Publishing to the Web, Articulate Online, LMS, or CD offers the ability to include  HTML 5 and iPad support. If you choose both, here's how Storyline determines  which version of the course to display:              If the learner is using a Flash compatible browser, the Flash version will be  displayed If the learner is using an iPad, the course will be displayed in the Articulate  Mobile Player app If the learner is using a non-Flash compatible browser, the HTML 5 version  will be displayed  You may find that viewing a published Storyline project on your  local computer does not work as expected. This may be due to local  security restrictions on your computer, the Flash player, or browser  security. To view a published story locally on a Windows PC without  security restrictions, you can use the Publish for CD option instead  and launch the course using the Launch_Story.exe file.  Follow along… The time has come to publish our story. In this exercise you will publish to the web  without tracking. Some additional information and considerations that you should  be aware of will follow this exercise.  1.  Let's start by opening Exercise 10 – Identity Theft and clicking on the   Publish button from the Home tab.  2.  Adjust the Title to be Safe Online Surfing. 3.  Click on the ellipsis next to the title and enter any other details you wish to   further describe the course. This is particularly useful for courses that are  hosted on a tracking system.  4.  Add the Description of a primer on operating securely on the Internet. 5.  Select the folder to contain the published output.  It's wise to avoid publishing on a network. Instead, publish locally to  prevent publishing errors, then copy or upload the published output  to a shared network location, web server, or LMS.  [ 242 ]   Chapter 10  6.  Click on Publish. 7.  When the completion prompt appears, click on View Project to review the   course and test functionality.  8.  When you return to Storyline, close the completion prompt, and save the file. 9.  Outside of Storyline, navigate to the folder where the published output  is located. The published output will be in a folder called Safe Online  Surfing output. Take a look at the files and note that you can launch the  course again by double-clicking on the story.html file.  Publishing with tracking You'll need an LMS to capture tracking and completion information. Storyline can  publish to Articulate Online, its own LMS, or an LMS of your choice. The options  between the two are similar with the exception of tracking; when publishing to an  LMS you can choose from several output formats, including SCORM 1, 2, SCORM  2004, AICC, or Tin Can API. In all cases, you'll need to identify how reporting and  tracking will be handled:  [ 243 ]   Publishing your Story  Considerations when tracking You will want to keep in mind the following points when working with your   course and adjusting tracking settings:                  If you do not have a quiz in your course and must mark the course as  complete, you can do this as mentioned earlier by setting the number of  slides viewed. If you need more precision, you can create a hidden quiz  question and use the associated results slide for course completion. Here   is a tutorial on how to do this http:  www.articulate.com support kb_ article.php?product=st1&id=8bi7nnp5g3z7.  If you have a single quiz, you can record learner completion based on the  associated results slide. If you have multiple quizzes, you can use only one results slide to mark   the course as passed or completed. If you are using the Tin Can API, the quiz result slide you select will   report overall results that includes individual questions from all quizzes   and results slides.  Other publishing options Storyline includes two other publishing options. The first option is Publish to CD,  which creates a version of the course that launches from an executable file. This can  be used for CD, DVD, or USB drive playback. The other option is Publish to Word. This is actually quite handy for review cycles  during development. A document is created that contains each slide, and optionally  slide layers along with slide notes. This includes quizzes with possible options and  the correct choices. It creates a visual transcript of a course and is a terrific feature  you can leverage to speed up documentation effort and content review processes   for your course.  [ 244 ]   Chapter 10  Considerations when working with   HTML 5 output The biggest challenge when it comes to publishing is playback on HTML 5 browsers  and mobile devices. The iPad generally works quite well when launching courses   from the Articulate Mobile Player app  downloaded for free from the App Store . Playback outside of Flash-based browsers or the iPad app, is fairly limited. This is  due, in part, to the infancy of the HTML 5 standard. HTML 5 is not fully implemented  and each browser and platform device handles things slightly differently, making  it challenging to create one course and have it operate as expected across multiple  browsers, platforms, and mobile devices. You'll get close by simplifying your course  content and removing content features that aren't supported across all platforms,   or by creating multiple versions optimized for the target environments.  The Appendix provides a link to a detailed chart of feature support when working  with Flash, HTML 5 and iOS  iPad output .  [ 245 ]   Publishing your Story  Summary Storyline makes it easy to publish a course and customize the way it appears when  published. It does this with simplicity and offers enough options to help you tailor  the experience so that it fits your design and cultural requirements.  Being able to save a player and re-use this for other Storyline courses is a   great time saver. Sharing with other developers helps create consistency   within development teams.  The many configuration settings offer another way to create original, custom  experiences for your learners. You might consider creating several players to   suit different types of courses as follows:     Sidebar menu visible with restricted navigation for linear courses    No Previous and Next buttons for courses with custom navigation    built within the Slide Masters.     No seekbar for courses that contain video clips with their own controls    to play, pause, step, and replay the video.     Chromeless, which means every player option is disabled leaving only a   10 pixel border around the slide content that can also be made transparent  leaving just the slide without any player controls at all. This is a crisp and  clean format that's great for self-running presentations or courses with your  own custom navigation built within the slide content.  The next chapter offers some advice to help you make the most from what you've  learned about Storyline.  [ 246 ]   Rapid Development  Rapid development is about how you can easily reuse, share, and edit e-learning  assets to expedite development of courses. This chapter provides some thoughts   on using Storyline effectively to produce quality results while increasing   your productivity.  In this chapter you will learn:     The concept of reusability in Storyline    Methods of leveraging existing assets    How to build once, and reuse many times    Best practices for organizing assets    Key productivity boosters in Storyline   Rapid Development  Concept of reusability The concept of reusability has its roots in the production process. Typically, most  of us go about creating e-learning using a process similar to what is shown in the  following screenshot. It works well for large teams and the one man band, except   in the latter case, you become a specialist for all the stages of production. That's   a heavy load. It's hard to be good at all things and it demands that you constantly  stretch and improve your skills, and find ways to increase the efficiency of what   you do.  Reusability in Storyline is about leveraging the formatting, look and feel and  interactions you create so that you can re-purpose your work and speed-up  production. Not every project will be an original one-off, in fact most won't,   so the concept is to approach development with a plan to repurpose 80 percent   of the media, quizzes, interactions, and designs you create. As you do this, you   begin to establish processes, templates, and libraries that can be used to rapidly  assemble base courses. With a little tweaking and some minor customization,   you'll have a new, original course in no time. Your client doesn't need to know   that 80 percent was made from reusable elements with just 20 percent created   as original, unique components, but you'll know the difference in terms of time   and effort.  [ 248 ]   Chapter 11  Leveraging existing assets So how can you leverage existing assets with Storyline? The first things you'll   want to look at are the courses you've built with other authoring programs,   such as PowerPoint, QuizMaker Engage, Captivate, Flash, and Camtasia.  If there are design themes, elements, or interactions within these courses that you  might want to use for future Storyline courses, you should focus your efforts on  importing what you can, and further adjusting within Storyline to create a new  version of the asset that can be reused for future Storyline courses. If re-working   the asset is too complex or if you don't expect to reuse it in multiple courses, then  using Storyline's web object feature to embed the interaction without re-working   it in any way may be the better approach. In both cases, you'll save time by reusing  content you've already put a lot of time in developing.  Importing external content Here are the steps to bring external content into Storyline:  1.  From the Articulate Startup screen or by choosing the Insert tab, and then   New Slide within a project, select the Import option.  2.  There are options to import PowerPoint, Quizmaker, and Storyline. All of   these will display the slides within the file to be imported. You can pick and  choose which slides to import into a new or the current scene in Storyline.  3.  The Engage option displays the entire interaction that can be imported into    a single slide in the current or a new scene.  4.  Click on Import to complete the process.  Considerations when importing Keep the following points in mind when importing:     PowerPoint and Quizmaker files can be imported directly into Storyline. Once   imported, you can edit the content like you would any other Storyline slide.  Master slides come along with the import making it simple to reuse previous  designs. Note that 64-bit PowerPoint is not supported and you must have an  installed, activated version of Quizmaker for the import to work.  [ 249 ]   Rapid Development  The PowerPoint to Storyline conversion is not one-to-one. You  can expect some alignment issues with slide objects due to the  fact that PowerPoint uses points and Storyline uses pixels. There  are 2.66 pixels for each point which is why you'll need to tweak  the imported slides just a bit. Same with Quizmaker though the  reason why is slightly different; Quizmaker is 686 x 424 in size,  whereas Storyline is 720 x 540 by default.     Engage files can be imported into Storyline and they are completely   functional, but cannot be edited within Storyline. Though the option to  import Engage appears on the Import screen, what Storyline is really doing is  creating a web object to contain the Engage interaction. Once imported into a  new scene, clicking on the Engage interaction will display an Options menu  where you can make minor adjustments to the behavior of the interaction as  well as Preview and Edit in it Engage. You can also resize and position the  interaction just as you would any web object. Remember that though web  objects work in iPad and HTML5 outputs, Engage content is Flash, so it will  not playback on an iPad or in an HTML5 browser. Like Quizmaker, you'll  need an installed, activated version of Engage for the import to work.     Flash, Captivate, and Camtasia files cannot be imported in Storyline and  cannot be edited within Storyline. You can however, use web objects to  embed these projects into Storyline or the Insert Flash option. In both cases,  the imported elements appear seamless to the learner while retaining full  functionality.  [ 250 ]   Chapter 11  Build once, and reuse many times Quizzing is at the heart of many e-learning courses where often the quiz questions  need to be randomized or even reused in different sections of a single course  that is,  the same questions for a pre and post-test . The concept of building once and reusing  many times works well with several aspects of Storyline. We'll start with quizzing  and a feature called Question Banks as follows:  Question Banks Question Bank offers a way to pool, reuse, and randomize questions within a project.  Slides in a question bank are housed within the project file but are not visible until  placed into the story. Question Banks can include groups of quiz slides and regular  slides  that is, you might include a regular slide if you need to provide instructions  for the quiz or would like to include a post-quiz summary .  [ 251 ]   Rapid Development  When you want to include questions from a Question Bank, you just need to insert   a new Quizzing slide, and then choose Draw from Bank. You can then select one   or more questions to include and randomize them if desired.  Follow along… This exercise will use the sample project file created in Chapter 8 called, Exercise  8 – Identity Theft. This should be open in order to begin the exercise. You will  be removing three questions from a scene and moving them into a question bank.  This will allow you to draw one or more of those questions at any point in the project  where the quiz questions are needed, as follows:  1.  From the Home tab, choose Question Banks, and then Create Question   bank. Title this Identity Theft Questions.  2.  Notice that a new tab has opened in Normal View. The Question Bank   appears in this tab. Click on the Import link and navigate to question slides 2,  3, and 4. From the Import drop-down menu at the top, select move questions  into question bank.  3.  Click on the Story View tab and notice the three slides containing the quiz   questions are no longer in the story. Click back on the Identity Theft tab and  notice that they are located here. The questions will not become a part of the  story until the next step, when you draw them from the bank. In Story View, click once on slide 1 to select it, and then from the Home tab,  choose Question Banks and New Draw from Question Bank.  4.   5.  From the Question Bank drop-down menu, select Identity Theft Questions.  All questions will be selected by default and will be randomized after being  placed into the story. This means that the learner will need to answer three  questions before continuing onto the next slide in the story. Click on Insert.  6.  The Question Bank draw has been inserted as slide 2. To see how this works,   Preview the scene.  [ 252 ]   7.  Save as Exercise 11 – Identity Theft Quiz.  Chapter 11  There are multiple ways to get back to the questions that are in a  question bank. You can do this by selecting the tab the questions are  located in  in this case, Identity Theft , you can view the question bank  slide in Normal View or choose Question Banks from the Home tab  and navigate to the name of the question bank you'd like to edit.  [ 253 ]   Rapid Development  Interaction templates Whether a question or interaction is created from scratch, from templates that came  with Storyline, or that someone else provided you will likely modify it to suit your  needs. To reuse a question or interaction, you can save it in a Storyline file by itself  and then import it into a project. All formatting, media, animations, and triggers   will come along with it.  Keep in mind that the slide size matters, for example, if you  save the template as 720x540 and import this into a project  with dimensions of 720x405, images will be stretched to  adapt to the 16:9 ratio.  Follow along… You created an interaction in Chapter 6, Using Variables to Customize the Learning  Experience that asked the learner to type their thoughts, and then displayed those  thoughts alongside the feedback. This is a common interaction that could be   used in many projects. Let's save it out on its own then bring it into our Identity  Theft Quiz. We'll start this exercise with a new, blank project as follows:  1.  With a new, blank project opened, select New Slide from the Home tab,  choose Import and navigate to Storyline. Locate Exercise 6 - Sales  Training and click on Open.  2.  Select None in the upper-right corner of the Import window to deselect   all slides, and then navigate to the Module 1 section and select just the  Details slide.  3.  Select import into Current Scene, and then click on the Import button. 4.  Delete the first blank slide. 5.  On the newly imported slide, in the Triggers panel, delete the Slide Trigger    set Mod1Complete…  and Player Trigger  jump to… .  6.  Save this as Exercise 11 – User Thought Interaction. 7.  Open Exercise 11 – Identity Theft Quiz and select the last slide. 8.  Let's bring in the interaction by selecting the Insert tab and choosing New   Slide then Import. Select Storyline and locate Exercise 11 – User  Thought Interaction. Only one slide will be selected, choose to import   this into the Current Scene and click the Import button.  9.  Open the TextEntry trigger that displays in the Trigger panel on the newly   imported interaction and change the variable to Thoughts.  10.  Preview the slide and test functionality. 11.  Save the file.  [ 254 ]   Chapter 11  Reusing glossaries and resources The Storyline Player includes tabs that contain glossary terms and definitions as   well as resources for links to supporting documents and websites. What if you   want to use the same glossary to resources listing in more than one project? You might think that, by saving the Player, the glossary and resources will also be  saved with it, however, this isn't what happens. The glossary and resources stay   with the project and not the Player.  To reuse these items you will need to save the current project as a template by  selecting the Articulate file icon  upper-left corner of the Storyline window  and  choosing Save As…, and then select the Storyline template from the file type   drop-down menu. When the template is used to create a new project, the glossary  and resources will come along with it  note that this works only when creating new  projects with the template .  [ 255 ]   Rapid Development  Reusing characters and images The Characters feature in Storyline is terrific for being able to insert high quality  cutout images of people into your e-learning courses. The fact that there are so many  poses and expressions lends itself to all sorts of creative ways to use these images.  The characters are available in every project, but how they are set up in terms  of poses and expressions needs to be manually configured each time you use a  character. For example, if you use a female character that is in a happy pose, but  when clicked changes to a confused pose, that means you have two states for the  character. If you want to use this character with these states in another project,   you'll need to manually re-create it, unless you save the characters in a file and  import them into a project.  Creating images from video  Another useful way to reuse existing media is to create images from video clips that  you may have for a project. Instead of spending time trying to locate fresh images,  why not create them from video footage you already have You can do this using the  technique shown here:?  [ 256 ]   Chapter 11  Best practices for organizing assets It doesn't take long to accumulate a large volume of files for a given project.   You can save a lot of time and frustration by keeping the following points in   mind as you set out to develop and manage e-learning courses:     Establish and adhere to a file naming convention and use this consistently.    Establish a versioning system and use this frequently and consistently,    bring the version number right into the beginning slide so there is no  confusion about which version is being worked on.     Create a master folder structure and copy this when starting a new project.  This ensures that the image files are placed in an image folder, documents  and scripts in another folder, and so on. Use this structure locally and on   a network if you are working with others.     Use a style kit to define the branding, colors, fonts, and template elements.   This is the single source for definitive information regarding the use of  your client's images, logos, and brand in the context of the design you have  created for the Storyline project. Version this style kit like you would the  master Storyline project files.  [ 257 ]   Rapid Development     Create a companion PowerPoint elements file that contains all the original   graphics and animations you may have created in PowerPoint then brought  into Storyline. Doing this will help you save time editing down the road  when changes are needed for these elements.     Establish a master or global folder structure that all projects can draw from.  This might contain folders for commonly used fonts, logos, sounds, images,  production process templates, Photoshop files, and so on.     Place into that master or global folder a living document called Storyline Best   Practices and Tips. This could be done using OneNote or EverNote, so you  can easily capture images, bookmarks, and other elements as you discover  new tips. You'll be amazed how many timesavers and workarounds there  are, not to mention interesting new ways of developing in Storyline. You'll  want to keep a list of these items; perhaps organized by production process,  development, graphics, audio, video, animation, and so on. Increase the  value of this curated information by having the whole production time  contribute to the shared knowledge base.  [ 258 ]   Chapter 11  Productivity boosters There are many ways to boost productivity when using Storyline. Your best bet  will be to approach development from the point of view of what's really necessary  and avoid creating more complexity than what's called for. Often the most elegant  solution is the simplest one.  Top 10 Storyline productivity boosters Here are 10 common methods to boost your productivity with Storyline:  1.  Become a master formatter. This means using shortcut keys and automating   where you can. Here are some examples:     When you need to apply formatting to multiple objects over multiple   layers or slides, double-click on the Format Painter option. This  lets you to continue applying formatting until you click anywhere  outside the slide.     Need to apply a trigger to multiple objects? Copy the trigger then  select all of the objects and click on the Paste button in the Trigger  panel. All you need to do now is make slight adjustments to each  instead of creating each trigger from scratch.     You can also use Duplicate or Ctrl + D to quickly copy objects. For   example, you might have multiple instances of the same interaction on  a slide, perhaps a tabbed interaction. To set up another fully working  instance, you can select all the objects that make up the interaction and  then duplicate the elements and make slight adjustments. Remember  that Ctrl + A is a shortcut key for selecting all of the elements on a slide. If you use a shape effect for a lot of the shapes in a project, such as  fills, outlines, and alignment, why repeat formatting over and over  again every time you insert a new shape when you can right-click on  a shape, button, or caption and choose Set as Default. Next time you  use one of these elements, it will come preformatted using your most  frequently used settings. Size your graphics before importing them into Storyline. You   want crisp, clear images. If you resize an image in Storyline, it will  become fuzzy since Storyline works only with raster graphics, not  scalable vector graphics. Note that the maximum size for an image   in Storyline is 2048 x 2048 pixels.          [ 259 ]   Rapid Development      Study the shortcut keys that are listed in the Appendix of this book  and get in the habit of using them for most tasks. This seems minor  but it will save a lot of time. It's also worthwhile to customize the  Quick Access toolbar so that features you commonly use are just a  click away.      Place the audio and video objects in once, then copy and paste  when you need to use the same clips on other slides. It's faster  than importing, particularly using shortcut keys. The bonus is that  Storyline does not increase the file size, it recognizes the duplicates   as copies whereas importing each time increases the file size and  treats each instance as a unique object, consuming memory, file  space, and additional to publishing time.  2.  Keep the trigger logic simple and well planned. Consistently organize them   from slide-to-slide so it's easier to interpret and edit.  3.  Use short variable names that are descriptive with logical sequencing and  numbering. It's much easier to see short variable names in various displays  and drop-down menus.  4.  Get into the habit of naming the objects in the timeline, again using short  names that are meaningful. This will speed up production by consuming   less of your time trying to figure out which object is which.  [ 260 ]   Chapter 11  5.  Leverage templates whenever you can. There are numerous ways you    can do this:  1.  Use the Save As... feature in the Articulate menu to save a projects   as a Storyline template. This saves not only the look and feel,  interactions and player set up, but also glossary and resource  information. This is a great technique when creating multiple   courses that are part of a series. If you have a single activity that you want to re-use, save it by itself  in a Storyline file and then Import the slide s  into other projects. This  speeds up production time because you are re-using, not re-creating,  you work with the added bonus that the interaction comes already  error-free and tested.  2.   3.  Make use of Master Slides to automate custom navigation. Set up  your navigation buttons and links once on a master slide rather   than duplicate on each individual slide.  6.  Use cue points to synchronize animations. It's a simple feature but a time saver.  Clicking on the Play button in the timeline plays back the slide animations and  audio track. Pressing C on the keyboard creates a cue point as you listen to the  audio. Later, you can align objects and animations to these markers.  7.  Keep daily versions, if you're working on things daily or weekly, if it's   upkeep. Use a consistent naming convention, for example, projectname-v001,  -v002, and so on.  8.  Preview often and publish frequently to check your progress. Look for   design inconsistency issues, functional errors, and navigation problems on  more than one monitor and in more than one browser. This will go a long  way in catching technical or design issues early in the process, otherwise  you'll have to apply changes to more slides scenes later, which will slow  down your productivity and increase your risk of errors.  9.  Take the time to get to know where the limitations are with Storyline, what   works well and not so well. Document tips and best practices and share it  with your team. It's a continual learning process and when shared, boosts   the productivity of the entire team.  10.  Save your projects often. There is no autosave in Storyline.  [ 261 ]   Rapid Development  Summary This chapter highlighted some of the techniques you can use right away to begin  boosting your productivity with Storyline. The title of the chapter is Rapid Development, but this is an overused term with many  meanings. It's impossible for a software tool to help you rapidly develop e-learning  courses. The tool can make the process more approachable, but as a developer or  instructional designer, you need to have the know-how and skills to properly operate  the tool. Great e-learning always begins with great content. You can dramatically  reduce production time by spending more time up-front in the planning stages  finalizing content and navigation prior to starting development in Storyline.  By practicing the top 10 productivity boosters, you'll be setting yourself up to   work more strategically with Storyline, where you are seeing the full potential   of the tool and will be able to apply your skills with the tool to specific learning  events in your courses.  As you've seen, Storyline has an almost open door policy where they have made  it incredibly easy to leverage the work you've already created in other tools. By  extension, you can easily curate the content you've not created; this is a huge time  saver and adds a level of depth that would have taken much longer to create any  other way.  One of the best ways to become more efficient and effective in Storyline is to  participate in the community of developers. This particular community is very active  and the Articulate E-Learning Heroes Forums  http:  community.articulate. com forums   are filled to the brim with helpful tips, techniques, inspiration, and  conversations. Your participation in this community will help you to become an  enthusiastic Storyline expert and a seasoned e-learning developer.

Creating your own keyboard shortcuts You can create your own keyboard shortcuts by adding features to the Quick   Access Toolbar. All you need to do is right-click on the button for any Storyline  feature, and select Add to Quick Access Toolbar. To use a feature with a shortcut  key, press and hold the Alt key on the keyboard, then press the number that matches  the button you want to launch. The first button on the Quick Access Toolbar is 1, the  second is 2, and so on. You can view a tutorial on how to do this at http:  www.screenr.com D3Z8.  [ 265 ]   Appendix  Player color customization The color selector in the Storyline Player lets you change the color of different  parts of the Player. You can view a quick reference chart that visually depicts  this and download it from Articulate at http:  community.articulate.com  downloads p 80796.aspx.  Story size and dimensions An important initial consideration when creating a new project in Storyline is the  Story size. This includes the actual slide size as well as the Player dimensions. You  must also factor in how the course will be viewed. Here are some guidelines related  to these design decisions.  Designing for multiple devices The story size needs to be 4:3 ratio for an iPad, so the default of 720 x 540 will work,  but also 1024 x 768 scaled to fill browser window. Most developers agree that a story  size of 988 x 741 works well for desktop and iPad delivery. Designers may opt for a  precise 978 grid system with the story size set to 988 x 643.  Common breakpoints  size limitations  320 pixels: mobile portrait 480 pixels: mobile landscape 600 pixels: small tablet 768 pixels: tablet portrait 1024 pixels: table landscape netbook 1280 pixels: desktop  Player size considerations The Storyline Player adds a minimum of 10 pixels all the way around your story  content when published. Depending on the features and controls you've included   on your player, the player can add between 20 and 260 pixels to the width and  between 20 and 118 pixels to the height.

Section 508, a US Federal law, requires that all Federal agencies give disabled people  access to information that is comparable to the access available to others. Storyline  supports Section 508 in the following ways:     Keyboard support    Content focus    Flicker reduction    Non-visual operation and information retrieval    Large text    Text equivalents    Assistive technology: Ready UI, Forms, Scripts  How Storyline complies with Section 508 is detailed on their website at   http:  www.articulate.com products storyline-section-508-vpat.php.  There are tips and guidelines available for Storyline developers on the Articulate  website at http:  www.articulate.com products storyline-section-508.php.  Storyline does not have a built-in Closed Captions feature. You can  add a transcript by using the Notes panel but this does not create true  Closed Captions that follow along as the narrator speaks. A fellow  Articulate "Super Hero", Steve Flowers, came up with a solution and  provides a demonstration with source code and discussion in the  Articulate forums located at http:  community.articulate. com forums p 14677 111423.aspx111423.
